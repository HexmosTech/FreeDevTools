</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       usepackage - <u>Usepackage</u> Environment Manager

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       See <u><a href="../man1/use.1.html">use</a>(1)</u>.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Usepackage</u>  is  an environment management program. It is based on the principle of <u>packages</u> - collections
       of executables that share a common set of necessary environment  variables,  such  as  PATH,  MANPATH  or
       LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

       For  each given <u>package</u>, <b>use</b> sources the appropriate environment information into the current shell.  The
       environment information is specified in packages files, see <u>PACKAGES</u>.

       The <b>usepackage</b> executable is the backend program used to generate environment  information  suitable  for
       sourcing  into  a  running  shell.  The  <b>use</b> frontend should be invoked to actually effect changes to the
       environment, see <u><a href="../man1/use.1.html">use</a>(1)</u>.

   <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <u>-v</u>     Output verbose information to the standard error stream.

       <u>-s</u>     Silence warnings for un-matched packages. This is useful in a shell <u>rc</u> script when  a  package  is
              known not to be available on all architectures that the shell is used on, see <u>PACKAGES</u>.

       <u>-c</u>     Force <u>csh</u> style environment output.

       <u>-b</u>     Force bourne shell style environment output.

       <u>-f</u> <u>file</u>
              Specify an alternate initial configuration file, see <u>PACKAGES</u>.

       <u>-l</u>     List available packages and groups, see <u>ANNOTATIONS</u> and <u>GROUPS</u>.

</pre><h4><b>PACKAGES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Usepackage</u> reads package environment information from the configuration file as follows:

   <b>LOAD</b> <b>ORDER</b>
       When  <u>Usepackage</u> starts up, it loads an initial configuration file, the name of this file may be given on
       the command line (see <u>OPTIONS</u>), otherwise it defaults to the builtin name "usepackage.conf" (see  <u>FILES</u>).
       This file is located by searching along a path which defaults to:

            <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>:~:.

       This  path  may  be overridden with the PACKAGES_PATH environment variable (see <u>ENVIRONMENT</u>).  A packages
       file may contain inclusion directives which cause the  sourcing  of  other  files  at  given  points.  An
       inclusion directive looks like:

            (include file-name)

       The  same location mechanism is used to find "file-name" as for the initial configuration file. A package
       file name may also be given as an absolute file name or may be shell-style  user  directory,  tilde  (~),
       relative.

   <b>SYNTAX</b>
       A package file consists of comments, delimited by a leading hash (#), or package definitions of the form:

            package [arch [os [version [host [shell]]]]]
                 [&lt;= requires ...] : setting [, setting ...] ;

       The <u>package</u>, <u>arch</u>, <u>os</u>, <u>version</u>, <u>host</u>, and <u>shell</u> parts may be simple shell-style patterns of the form:

       *              matches anything.

       foo*           matches "foo", "foobar" etc.

       {foo,bar}      matches "foo" or "bar".

       The <u>requires</u> list specifies the names of other packages which must be sourced into the environment before
       the settings for this package are processed.

       A  <u>setting</u>  is  either  a variable definition, an alias definition (both described below) or a section of
       text to be directly evaluated in the shell, delimited with <u>&lt;[</u> and <u>]&gt;</u>, for example:

            &lt;[ /usr/local/bin/test-init ]&gt;

       When <u>Usepackage</u> searches for the definition for a particular  package,  it  compares  each  line  in  the
       packages  file  against  the name of the package given (package) and system-dependant information for the
       execution host, as obtained by <u><a href="../man2/uname.2.html">uname</a></u>(2).  This information is the hardware implementation (platform), the
       operating system name (os), the operating system version (version) and the hostname  (host).  Comparisons
       are  case-insensitive. If a match is obtained then the given variable definitions and script sections are
       processed to modify the environment. A  variable definition may have one of the following forms:

            var-name = "string"
            var-name = path-list
            var-name += path-list
            var-name += "string"
            var-name =+ path-list
            var-name =+ "string"

       The first sets the given variable to a literal string value, the second sets the given variable to a path
       list, the third prepends the current value of a variable  with  the  given  path  list,  and  the  fourth
       interprets  the  literal  string as a path list and prepends it to the current value of the variable. The
       fourth and fifth forms do the same, but append to the current value of the variable. Path lists are colon
       (:) separated lists of directories and may contain  shell-style  tilde  (~),  user-relative,  directories
       which  will be expanded automatically (except when the path list is given as a literal string). When pre-
       pending paths to a variable, duplicate paths are removed from the original value first.

       In addition, <u>Usepackage</u> can optionally test for the existence of paths before setting or adding  them  to
       variables. This is done with the test form of the above operators:

            var-name ?= path-list
            var-name ?+= path-list
            var-name ?+= "string"

       These operate as per the definitions above, but will ignore path components that don't exist.

       An alias definition has one of the following forms:

            alias name = name
            alias name = path
            alias name = "string"

       These will define a matching shell alias.

   <b>GROUPS</b>
       In  addition  to  the  package definitions in a packages file, there may also be group definitions. These
       have the following syntax:

            group := package [, package ...] ;

       <u>Usepackage</u> searches for a given package name in the defined groups first, if  the  given  name  matchs  a
       group  name  then the packages defined as part of that group are sourced into the environment together. A
       group definition may not reference other groups and may not contain patterns.

   <b>ANNOTATIONS</b>
       In order to give useful package information to the user, annotations may be placed in the  packages  file
       that give summaries of packages. These annotations have the form:

            &gt;&gt; name : "description" &lt;&lt;

       <u>Usepackage</u>  collects  these  annotations  together  and  displays  them when called with the <u>-l</u> flag, see
       <u>OPTIONS</u>.  These annotations have no impact on the package mechanism and need not necessarily be beside or
       correspond to the package definitions (although this is the sensible way to arrange things).

   <b>EXAMPLE</b>
       The following fragment of a packages file illustrates the main features:

            # GNU software is available everywhere:

            &gt;&gt; GNU : "The GNU project software" &lt;&lt;

            GNU :                     PATH += /usr/local/gnu/bin,
                                      MANPATH += /usr/local/gnu/man ;

            # CVS requires RCS which is found in the GNU package, but
            # is only available on SPARC Solaris machines:

            &gt;&gt; CVS : "Concurrent Versions System revision control" &lt;&lt;

            CVS sun4* SunOS 5.* &lt;= GNU :
                                      CVSROOT = /usr/src/cvsroot,
                                      CVSEDITOR = "vi",
                                      PATH += /usr/local/cvs/bin,
                                      MANPATH += /usr/local/cvs/man ;

            # User bin directories (Solaris will run SunOS 4 binaries):
            # (Only added to the path if the directories actually exist)

            &gt;&gt; user : "User's own programs" &lt;&lt;

            user sun4* SunOS :        PATH ?+= <a href="file:~/bin/sun4">~/bin/sun4</a> ;
            user sun4* SunOS 5.* :    PATH ?+= <a href="file:~/bin/solaris">~/bin/solaris</a> ;
            user alpha OSF :          PATH ?+= <a href="file:~/bin/alpha">~/bin/alpha</a> ;

            # Useful aliases:

            aliases : alias more = less,
                      alias ls = "ls --color",
                      alias cc = /usr/bin/gcc ;

            # Special function for zsh:

            &gt;&gt; zsh-function : "Special zsh function" &lt;&lt;

            zsh-function * * * * zsh :
                  &lt;[ hello() { echo "Hello World!"; } ]&gt; ;

            # include standard packages:

            (include packages.standard)

            # security hole:

            dot :                     PATH += . ;

            # groups:

            user-setup := standard, user ;
            programmer-setup := standard, CVS, user, dot ;

       Note the use of Operating System version numbers to distinguish between SunOS 4 and  Solaris  (SunOS  5),
       the  use  of  "sun4*"  to match the multiple different platform versions of SPARC machines (sun4m, sun4c,
       etc.) and the fact that package "user" on a SPARC Solaris machine will match both of the first two  lines
       of  the "user" package section, resulting in the "solaris" directory and the "sun4" directory being added
       into the PATH.

       Assuming the appropriate shell setup script has been sourced - see <u><a href="../man1/use.1.html">use</a>(1)</u> - then  the  following  command
       will cause the CVS environment (including the GNU environment) to be sourced:

            $ use CVS

       Note that on a DEC Alpha machine, this will generate a warning like:

            $ use CVS
            warning: no match for package `CVS' on this host.

       In  a  shell  script  which  is  executed  on  a number of different platforms (such as the shell startup
       script). These warnings may be silenced (see <u>OPTIONS</u>).

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/usr/share/usepackage/usepackage.conf</b>
                      The default master packages file.

       <b>/usr/share/usepackage/use.csh</b>
                      Shell setup for csh and derivatives.

       <b>/usr/share/usepackage/use.bsh</b>
                      Shell setup for bourne shell and derivatives.

       <b>/usr/share/usepackage/use.ksh</b>
                      Shell setup for ksh.

       <b>/usr/bin/usepackage</b>
                      The underlying <u>Usepackage</u> executable.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Other than the reading and re-definition of environment variables for package setup, <b>use</b>  also  uses  the
       following environment variables for user configuration:

       <b>PACKAGES_PATH</b>  Colon-separated path list giving the directories to search for configuration files. Shell-
                      style tilde (~) user-directory escapes are expanded.

       <b>HOME</b>           If  present  in  the  environment, this is used to provide the expansion for the tilde (~)
                      user-directory.

       <b>SHELL</b>          If present in the environment, the last path component of this is used for shell  matching
                      (see  <u>SYNTAX</u>)  and  detecting  the  style  of  environment output that should be used (see
                      <u>OPTIONS</u>).
