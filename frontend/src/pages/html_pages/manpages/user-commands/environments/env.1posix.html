</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       env — set the environment for command invocation

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       env <b>[</b>-i<b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>name</u>=<u>value</u><b>]</b>... <b>[</b><u>utility</u> <b>[</b><u>argument</u>...<b>]]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>env</u>  utility shall obtain the current environment, modify it according to its arguments, then invoke
       the utility named by the <u>utility</u> operand with the modified environment.

       Optional arguments shall be passed to <u>utility</u>.

       If no <u>utility</u> operand is specified, the resulting environment shall be written to  the  standard  output,
       with one <u>name</u>=<u>value</u> pair per line.

       If the first argument is <b>'-'</b>, the results are unspecified.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>env</u>  utility  shall  conform  to  the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>12.2</u>, <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>, except for the unspecified usage of <b>'-'</b>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-i</b>        Invoke <u>utility</u>  with  exactly  the  environment  specified  by  the  arguments;  the  inherited
                 environment shall be ignored completely.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <u>name</u>=<u>value</u>
                 Arguments  of  the  form <u>name</u>=<u>value</u> shall modify the execution environment, and shall be placed
                 into the inherited environment before the <u>utility</u> is invoked.

       <u>utility</u>   The name of the utility to be invoked. If the <u>utility</u> operand names any of the special built-in
                 utilities in <u>Section</u> <u>2.14</u>, <u>Special</u> <u>Built-In</u> <u>Utilities</u>, the results are undefined.

       <u>argument</u>  A string to pass as an argument for the invoked utility.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>env</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u>  <u>Variables</u>  for  the
                 precedence   of   internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values  of  locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the  other  internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine  the  locale  for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to  affect  the  format  and  contents  of  diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

       <u>PATH</u>      Determine  the  location  of  the  <u>utility</u>,  as  described  in  the  Base Definitions volume of
                 POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Chapter</u> <u>8</u>, <u>Environment</u> <u>Variables</u>.  If <u>PATH</u> is specified as a  <u>name</u>=<u>value</u>  operand
                 to <u>env</u>, the <u>value</u> given shall be used in the search for <u>utility</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       If no <u>utility</u> operand is specified, each <u>name</u>=<u>value</u> pair in the resulting environment shall be written in
       the form:

           "%s=%s\n", &lt;<u>name</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;

       If the <u>utility</u> operand is specified, the <u>env</u> utility shall not write to standard output.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       If  <u>utility</u>  is  invoked,  the exit status of <u>env</u> shall be the exit status of <u>utility</u>; otherwise, the <u>env</u>
       utility shall exit with one of the following values:

           0   The <u>env</u> utility completed successfully.

       1-125   An error occurred in the <u>env</u> utility.

         126   The utility specified by <u>utility</u> was found but could not be invoked.

         127   The utility specified by <u>utility</u> could not be found.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>command</u>, <u>env</u>, <u>nice</u>, <u>nohup</u>, <u>time</u>, and <u>xargs</u> utilities have been specified to use exit code 127  if  an
       error  occurs  so  that applications can distinguish ``failure to find a utility'' from ``invoked utility
       exited with an error indication''. The value 127 was chosen because it is not  commonly  used  for  other
       meanings; most utilities use small values for ``normal error conditions'' and the values above 128 can be
       confused  with  termination  due  to receipt of a signal. The value 126 was chosen in a similar manner to
       indicate that the utility could be found, but not invoked. Some scripts produce meaningful error messages
       differentiating the 126 and 127 cases. The distinction between  exit  codes  126  and  127  is  based  on
       KornShell  practice  that uses 127 when all attempts to <u>exec</u> the utility fail with <b>[ENOENT]</b>, and uses 126
       when any attempt to <u>exec</u> the utility fails for any other reason.

       Historical implementations of the <u>env</u> utility use the <u>execvp</u>()  or  <u>execlp</u>()  functions  defined  in  the
       System  Interfaces  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017  to  invoke  the  specified  utility;  this  provides better
       performance and keeps users from  having  to  escape  characters  with  special  meaning  to  the  shell.
       Therefore,  shell functions, special built-ins, and built-ins that are only provided by the shell are not
       found.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following command:

           env -i PATH=/mybin:"$PATH" $(getconf V7_ENV) mygrep xyz myfile

       invokes the command <u>mygrep</u> with a new <u>PATH</u> value as the only entry in  its  environment  other  than  any
       variables  required  by  the implementation for conformance. In this case, <u>PATH</u> is used to locate <u>mygrep</u>,
       which is expected to reside in <b>/mybin</b>.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       As with all other utilities that invoke other utilities, this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 only specifies  what
       <u>env</u>  does  with  standard  input,  standard  output,  standard error, input files, and output files. If a
       utility is executed, it is not constrained by the specification of input and output by <u>env</u>.

       The <b>-i</b> option was added to allow the functionality of the removed <b>-</b> option in a  manner  compatible  with
       the Utility Syntax Guidelines. It is possible to create a non-conforming environment using the <b>-i</b> option,
       as it may remove environment variables required by the implementation for conformance. The following will
       preserve these environment variables as well as preserve the <u>PATH</u> for conforming utilities:

           IFS='
           '
           # The preceding value should be &lt;space&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;newline&gt;.
           # Set IFS to its default value.

           set -f
           # disable pathname expansion

           \unalias -a
           # Unset all possible aliases.
           # Note that unalias is escaped to prevent an alias
           # being used for unalias.
           # This step is not strictly necessary, since aliases are not inherited,
           # and the ENV environment variable is only used by interactive shells,
           # the only way any aliases can exist in a script is if it defines them
           # itself.

           unset -f env getconf
           # Ensure env and getconf are not user functions.

           env -i $(getconf V7_ENV) PATH="$(getconf PATH)" command

       Some have suggested that <u>env</u> is redundant since the same effect is achieved by:

           name=value ... utility <b>[</b> argument ... <b>]</b>

       The  example  is  equivalent to <u>env</u> when an environment variable is being added to the environment of the
       command, but not when the environment is being set to the given value.  The <u>env</u> utility also  writes  out
       the  current  environment if invoked without arguments. There is sufficient functionality beyond what the
       example provides to justify inclusion of <u>env</u>.
