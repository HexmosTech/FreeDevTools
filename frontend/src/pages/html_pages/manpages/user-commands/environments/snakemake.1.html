   <b>positional</b> <b>arguments:</b>
       target Targets to build. May be rules or files.

   <b>optional</b> <b>arguments:</b>
       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              show this help message and exit

       <b>--snakefile</b> FILE, <b>-s</b> FILE
              The workflow definition in a snakefile.

       <b>--gui</b> [PORT]
              Serve  an  HTML  based  user  interface  to the given port (default: 8000). If possible, a browser
              window is opened.

       <b>--cores</b> [N], <b>--jobs</b> [N], <b>-j</b> [N]
              Use at most N cores in parallel (default: 1). If N is omitted, the limit is set to the  number  of
              available cores.

       <b>--resources</b> [NAME=INT [NAME=INT ...]], <b>--res</b> [NAME=INT [NAME=INT ...]]
              Define  additional  resources  that  shall  constrain  the  scheduling analogously to threads (see
              above). A resource is defined as a name and an integer value.  E.g. <b>--resources</b> gpu=1.  Rules  can
              use resources by defining the resource keyword, e.g. resources: gpu=1.  If now two rules require 1
              of the resource 'gpu' they won't be run in parallel by the scheduler.

       <b>--config</b> [KEY=VALUE [KEY=VALUE ...]]
              Set  or  overwrite values in the workflow config object.  The workflow config object is accessible
              as variable config inside the workflow. Default values can be set by providing a  JSON  file  (see
              Documentation).

       <b>--configfile</b> FILE
              Specify  or  overwrite the config file of the workflow (see the docs). Values specified in JSON or
              YAML format are available in the global config dictionary inside the workflow.

       <b>--list</b>, <b>-l</b>
              Show available rules in given Snakefile.

       <b>--list-target-rules</b>, <b>--lt</b>
              Show available target rules in given Snakefile.

       <b>--directory</b> DIR, <b>-d</b> DIR
              Specify working directory (relative paths in the snakefile will use this as their origin).

       <b>--dryrun</b>, <b>-n</b>
              Do not execute anything.

       <b>--printshellcmds</b>, <b>-p</b>
              Print out the shell commands that will be executed.

       <b>--dag</b>  Do not execute anything and print the  directed  acyclic  graph  of  jobs  in  the  dot  language.
              Recommended use on Unix systems: snakemake <b>--dag</b> | dot | display

       <b>--rulegraph</b>
              Do  not execute anything and print the dependency graph of rules in the dot language. This will be
              less crowded than above DAG of jobs, but also show  less  information.  Note  that  each  rule  is
              displayed once, hence the displayed graph will be cyclic if a rule appears in several steps of the
              workflow.  Use  this  if  above  option leads to a DAG that is too large.  Recommended use on Unix
              systems: snakemake <b>--rulegraph</b> | dot | display

       <b>--d3dag</b>
              Print the DAG in D3.js compatible JSON format.

       <b>--summary</b>, <b>-S</b>
              Print a summary of all files created by the workflow.  The has the  following  columns:  filename,
              modification  time,  rule version, status, plan. Thereby rule version contains the versionthe file
              was created with (see the version keyword of rules),  and  status  denotes  whether  the  file  is
              missing,  its input files are newer or if version or implementation of the rule changed since file
              creation. Finally the last column denotes whether the file will be updated or created  during  the
              next workflow execution.

       <b>--detailed-summary</b>, <b>-D</b>
              Print  a  summary  of all files created by the workflow.  The has the following columns: filename,
              modification time, rule version, input file(s), shell command, status, plan. Thereby rule  version
              contains  the  versionthe  file  was  created  with (see the version keyword of rules), and status
              denotes whether the file is missing, its input files are newer or if version or implementation  of
              the   rule   changed   since  file  creation.  The  input  file  and  shell  command  columns  are
              selfexplanatory. Finally the last column denotes whether the  file  will  be  updated  or  created
              during the next workflow execution.

       <b>--touch</b>, <b>-t</b>
              Touch  output  files  (mark them up to date without really changing them) instead of running their
              commands. This is used to  pretend  that  the  rules  were  executed,  in  order  to  fool  future
              invocations of snakemake. Fails if a file does not yet exist.

       <b>--keep-going</b>, <b>-k</b>
              Go on with independent jobs if a job fails.

       <b>--force</b>, <b>-f</b>
              Force the execution of the selected target or the first rule regardless of already created output.

       <b>--forceall</b>, <b>-F</b>
              Force  the  execution  of  the  selected  (or  the  first)  rule  and all rules it is dependent on
              regardless of already created output.

       <b>--forcerun</b> TARGET [TARGET ...], <b>-R</b> TARGET [TARGET ...]
              Force the re-execution or creation of the given rules or files. Use this option if you  changed  a
              rule and want to have all its output in your workflow updated.

       <b>--prioritize</b> TARGET [TARGET ...], <b>-P</b> TARGET [TARGET ...]
              Tell  the  scheduler  to  assign  creation  of  given targets (and all their dependencies) highest
              priority.  (EXPERIMENTAL)

       <b>--allow-ambiguity</b>, <b>-a</b>
              Don't check for ambiguous rules and simply use the first if several can  produce  the  same  file.
              This allows the user to prioritize rules by their order in the snakefile.

       <b>--cluster</b> CMD, <b>-c</b> CMD
              Execute  snakemake  rules  with  the given submit command, e.g. qsub. Snakemake compiles jobs into
              scripts that are submitted to the cluster with the given command,  once  all  input  files  for  a
              particular  job  are present.  The submit command can be decorated to make it aware of certain job
              properties (input, output, params, wildcards, log, threads  and  dependencies  (see  the  argument
              below)), e.g.: $ snakemake <b>--cluster</b> 'qsub <b>-pe</b> threaded {threads}'.

       <b>--cluster-sync</b> CMD
              cluster  submission  command  will  block, returning the remote exitstatus upon remote termination
              (for example, this should be usedif the cluster command is 'qsub <b>-sync</b> y' (SGE)

       <b>--drmaa</b> [ARGS]
              Execute snakemake on a cluster accessed via DRMAA, Snakemake compiles jobs into scripts  that  are
              submitted  to  the  cluster  with the given command, once all input files for a particular job are
              present. ARGS can be used to specify options of the underlying cluster system, thereby  using  the
              job  properties  input,  output, params, wildcards, log, threads and dependencies, e.g.: <b>--drmaa</b> '
              <b>-pe</b> threaded {threads}'.  Note that ARGS must be given in quotes and with a leading whitespace.

       <b>--cluster-config</b> FILE, <b>-u</b> FILE
              A JSON or YAML file that defines the wildcards used in 'cluster'for  specific  rules,  instead  of
              having  them  specified  in  the Snakefile.For example, for rule 'job' you may define: { 'job' : {
              'time' : '24:00:00' } } to specify the time for rule 'job'.

       <b>--immediate-submit</b>, <b>--is</b>
              Immediately submit all jobs to the cluster instead of waiting for present input files.  This  will
              fail,  unless  you  make  the  cluster  aware of job dependencies, e.g. via: $ snakemake <b>--cluster</b>
              'sbatch <b>--dependency</b> {dependencies}. Assuming that your submit script (here  sbatch)  outputs  the
              generated  job id to the first stdout line, {dependencies} will be filled with space separated job
              ids this job depends on.

       <b>--jobscript</b> SCRIPT, <b>--js</b> SCRIPT
              Provide a custom job script  for  submission  to  the  cluster.  The  default  script  resides  as
              'jobscript.sh' in the installation directory.

       <b>--jobname</b> NAME, <b>--jn</b> NAME
              Provide  a custom name for the jobscript that is submitted to the cluster (see <b>--cluster</b>). NAME is
              "snakejob.{rulename}.{jobid}.sh" per default. The wildcard {jobid} has to be present in the name.

       <b>--reason</b>, <b>-r</b>
              Print the reason for each executed rule.

       <b>--stats</b> FILE
              Write stats about Snakefile execution in JSON format to the given file.

       <b>--nocolor</b>
              Do not use a colored output.

       <b>--quiet</b>, <b>-q</b>
              Do not output any progress or rule information.

       <b>--nolock</b>
              Do not lock the working directory

       <b>--unlock</b>
              Remove a lock on the working directory.

       <b>--cleanup-metadata</b> [FILE [FILE ...]], <b>--cm</b> [FILE [FILE ...]]
              Cleanup the metadata of given files. That means that snakemake removes any tracked  version  info,
              and any marks that files are incomplete.

       <b>--rerun-incomplete</b>, <b>--ri</b>
              Re-run all jobs the output of which is recognized as incomplete.

       <b>--ignore-incomplete</b>, <b>--ii</b>
              Ignore any incomplete jobs.

       <b>--list-version-changes</b>, <b>--lv</b>
              List  all  output  files  that  have  been  created with a different version (as determined by the
              version keyword).

       <b>--list-code-changes</b>, <b>--lc</b>
              List all output files for which the rule body (run or shell) have changed in the Snakefile.

       <b>--list-input-changes</b>, <b>--li</b>
              List all output files for which the defined input files have changed in the  Snakefile  (e.g.  new
              input  files  were  added  in  the  rule definition or files were renamed). For listing input file
              modification in the filesystem, use <b>--summary</b>.

       <b>--list-params-changes</b>, <b>--lp</b>
              List all output files for which the defined params have changed in the Snakefile.

       <b>--latency-wait</b> SECONDS, <b>--output-wait</b> SECONDS, <b>-w</b> SECONDS
              Wait given seconds if an output file of a job is not present after the job finished. This helps if
              your filesystem suffers from latency (default 5).

       <b>--wait-for-files</b> [FILE [FILE ...]]
              Wait <b>--latency-wait</b> seconds for these files to be present  before  executing  the  workflow.  This
              option is used internally to handle filesystem latency in cluster environments.

       <b>--benchmark-repeats</b> N
              Repeat a job N times if marked for benchmarking (default 1).

       <b>--notemp</b>, <b>--nt</b>
              Ignore  temp() declarations. This is useful when running only a part of the workflow, since temp()
              would lead to deletion of probably needed files by other parts of the workflow.

       <b>--keep-target-files</b>
              Do not adjust the paths of given target files relative to the working directory.

       <b>--allowed-rules</b> ALLOWED_RULES [ALLOWED_RULES ...]
              Only use given rules. If omitted, all rules in Snakefile are used.

       <b>--timestamp</b>, <b>-T</b>
              Add a timestamp to all logging output

       <b>--greediness</b> GREEDINESS
              Set the greediness of scheduling. This value between 0 and  1  determines  how  careful  jobs  are
              selected  for  execution.  The  default  value  (1.0) provides the best speed and still acceptable
              scheduling quality.

       <b>--print-compilation</b>
              Print the python representation of the workflow.

       <b>--overwrite-shellcmd</b> OVERWRITE_SHELLCMD
              Provide a shell command that shall be executed instead of those given in the workflow. This is for
              debugging purposes only.

       <b>--verbose</b>
              Print debugging output.

       <b>--debug</b>
              Allow one to debug rules with e.g. PDB. This flag allows to set breakpoints in run blocks.

       <b>--profile</b> FILE
              Profile Snakemake and write the output to FILE. This requires yappi to be installed.

       <b>--bash-completion</b>
              Output code to register bash  completion  for  snakemake.   Put  the  following  in  your  .bashrc
              (including the accents): `snakemake <b>--bash-completion</b>` or issue it in an open terminal session.

       <b>--version</b>, <b>-v</b>
              show program's version number and exit
