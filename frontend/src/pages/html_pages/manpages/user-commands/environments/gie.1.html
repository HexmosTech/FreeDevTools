</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gie - The Geospatial Integrity Investigation Environment

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          <b>gie</b> [ <b>-hovql</b> [ args ] ] file[s]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>gie</u>, the Geospatial Integrity Investigation Environment, is a regression testing environment for the PROJ
       transformation  library. Its primary design goal is to be able to perform regression testing of code that
       are a part of PROJ, while not requiring any other kind of  tooling  than  the  same  C  compiler  already
       employed for compiling the library.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Print usage information

       <b>-o</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;,</b> <b>--output</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Specify output file name

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Verbose: Provide non-essential informational output. Repeat <u>-v</u> for more verbosity (e.g. <b>-vv</b>)

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b>
              Quiet:  Opposite  of  verbose.  In  quiet  mode  not even errors are reported. Only interaction is
              through the return code (0 on success, non-zero indicates number of FAILED tests)

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--list</b>
              List the PROJ internal system error codes

       <b>--version</b>
              Print version number

       Tests for <u>gie</u> are defined in simple text files. Usually having the  extension  <b>.gie</b>.  Test  for  <u>gie</u>  are
       written  in  the  purpose-build  command  language  for  gie.  The basic functionality of the gie command
       language is implemented through just 3 command verbs: <b>operation</b>, which  defines  the  PROJ  operation  to
       test, <b>accept</b>, which defines the input coordinate to read, and <b>expect</b>, which defines the result to expect.

       A sample test file for <u>gie</u> that uses the three above basic commands looks like:

          &lt;gie&gt;

          --------------------------------------------
          Test output of the UTM projection
          --------------------------------------------
          operation  +proj=utm  +zone=32  +ellps=GRS80
          --------------------------------------------
          accept     12  55
          expect     691_875.632_14   6_098_907.825_05

          &lt;/gie&gt;

       Parsing  of  a  <u>gie</u> file starts at <b>&lt;gie&gt;</b> and ends when <b>&lt;/gie&gt;</b> is reached. Anything before <b>&lt;gie&gt;</b> and after
       <b>&lt;/gie&gt;</b> is not considered.  Test cases are  created  by  defining  an  <u>operation</u>  which  <u>accept</u>  an  input
       coordinate and <u>expect</u> an output coordinate.

       Because  <u>gie</u>  tests  are wrapped in the <b>&lt;gie&gt;</b>/<b>&lt;/gie&gt;</b> tags it is also possible to add test cases to custom
       made <u>init</u> <u>files</u>.  The tests will be ignore by PROJ when reading the init file with <u>+init</u> and <u>gie</u>  ignores
       anything not wrapped in <b>&lt;gie&gt;</b>/<b>&lt;/gie&gt;</b>.

       <u>gie</u>  tests  are  defined  by  a  set  of commands like <u>operation</u>, <u>accept</u> and <u>expect</u> in the example above.
       Together the commands make out the <u>gie</u> command language. Any line in a <u>gie</u> file that does not start  with
       a command is ignored. In the example above it is seen how this can be used to add comments and styling to
       <u>gie</u> test files in order to make them more readable as well as documenting what the purpose of the various
       tests are.

       Below the <u>gie</u> <u>command</u> <u>language</u> is explained in details.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       1. Run all tests in a file with all debug information turned on

          gie -vvvv corner-cases.gie

       2. Run all tests in several files

          gie foo bar

</pre><h4><b>GIE</b> <b>COMMAND</b> <b>LANGUAGE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>operation</b> <b>&lt;+args&gt;</b>
              Define a PROJ operation to test. Example:

                 operation proj=utm zone=32 ellps=GRS80
                 # test 4D function
                 accept    12 55 0 0
                 expect    691875.63214  6098907.82501  0  0

                 # test 2D function
                 accept    12 56
                 expect    687071.4391   6210141.3267

       <b>accept</b> <b>&lt;x</b> <b>y</b> <b>[z</b> <b>[t]]&gt;</b>
              Define  the  input  coordinate  to  read.  Takes test coordinate. The coordinate can be defined by
              either 2, 3 or 4 values, where the first two values are the x- and y-components, the  3rd  is  the
              z-component  and  the  4th  is  the  time  component.  The  number of components in the coordinate
              determines which version of the operation is tested (2D,  3D  or  4D).  Many  coordinates  can  be
              accepted for one <u>operation</u>. For each <u>accept</u> an accompanying <u>expect</u> is needed.

              Note that <u>gie</u> accepts the underscore (<b>_</b>) as a thousands separator. It is not required (in fact, it
              is  entirely  ignored  by the input routine), but it significantly improves the readability of the
              very long strings of numbers typically required in projected coordinates.

              See <u>operation</u> for an example.

       <b>expect</b> <b>&lt;x</b> <b>y</b> <b>[z</b> <b>[t]]&gt;</b> <b>|</b> <b>&lt;error</b> <b>code&gt;</b>
              Define the expected coordinate that will be returned from accepted  coordinate  passed  though  an
              operation.  The  expected  coordinate  can be defined by either 2, 3 or 4 components, similarly to
              <u>accept</u>.  Many coordinates can be expected for one  <u>operation</u>.  For  each  <u>expect</u>  an  accompanying
              <u>accept</u> is needed.

              See <u>operation</u> for an example.

              In  addition  to expecting a coordinate it is also possible to expect a PROJ error code in case an
              operation can't be created. This is useful  when  testing  that  errors  are  caught  and  handled
              correctly.  Below  is  an  example of that tests that the pipeline operator fails correctly when a
              non-invertible pipeline is constructed.

                 operation   proj=pipeline step
                             proj=urm5 n=0.5 inv
                 expect      failure pjd_err_malformed_pipeline

              See <u>gie</u> <u>--list</u> for a list of error codes that can be expected.

       <b>tolerance</b> <b>&lt;tolerance&gt;</b>
              The <u>tolerance</u> command controls how  much  accepted  coordinates  can  deviate  from  the  expected
              coordinate. This is handy to test that an operation meets a certain numerical tolerance threshold.
              Some operations are expected to be accurate within millimeters where others might only be accurate
              within a few meters. <u>tolerance</u> should

                 operation       proj=merc
                 # test coordinate as returned by ```echo 12 55 | proj +proj=merc``
                 tolerance       1 cm
                 accept          12 55
                 expect          1335833.89 7326837.72

                 # test that the same coordinate with a 50 m false easting as determined
                 # by ``echo 12 55 |proj +proj=merc +x_0=50`` is still within a 100 m
                 # tolerance of the unaltered coordinate from proj=merc
                 tolerance       100 m
                 accept          12 55
                 expect          1335883.89  7326837.72

              The default tolerance is 0.5 mm. See <u>proj</u> <u>-lu</u> for a list of possible units.

       <b>roundtrip</b> <b>&lt;n&gt;</b> <b>&lt;tolerance&gt;</b>
              Do a roundtrip test of an operation. <u>roundtrip</u> needs a <u>operation</u> and a <u>accept</u> command to function.
              The  accepted  coordinate  is  passed to the operation first in it's forward mode, then the output
              from the forward operation is passed back to the inverse  operation.  This  procedure  is  done  <b>n</b>
              times. If the resulting coordinate is within the set tolerance of the initial coordinate, the test
              is passed.

              Example with the default 100 iterations and the default tolerance:

                 operation       proj=merc
                 accept          12 55
                 roundtrip

              Example with count and default tolerance:

                 operation       proj=merc
                 accept          12 55
                 roundtrip       10000

              Example with count and tolerance:

                 operation       proj=merc
                 accept          12 55
                 roundtrip       10000 5 mm

       <b>direction</b> <b>&lt;direction&gt;</b>
              The  <u>direction</u>  command specifies in which direction an operation is performed. This can either be
              <b>forward</b> or <b>inverse</b>. An example of this is seen  below  where  it  is  tested  that  a  symmetrical
              transformation pipeline returns the same results in both directions.

                 operation proj=pipeline zone=32 step
                           proj=utm  ellps=GRS80 step
                           proj=utm  ellps=GRS80 inv
                 tolerance 0.1 mm

                 accept 12 55 0 0
                 expect 12 55 0 0

                 # Now the inverse direction (still same result: the pipeline is symmetrical)

                 direction inverse
                 expect 12 55 0 0

              The default direction is "forward".

       <b>ignore</b> <b>&lt;error</b> <b>code&gt;</b>
              This  is  especially  useful  in  test  cases  that  rely  on  a grid that is not guaranteed to be
              available. Below is an example of that situation.

                 operation proj=hgridshift +grids=nzgd2kgrid0005.gsb ellps=GRS80
                 tolerance 1 mm
                 ignore    pjd_err_failed_to_load_grid
                 accept    172.999892181021551 -45.001620431954613
                 expect    173                 -45

              See <u>gie</u> <u>--list</u> for a list of error codes that can be ignored.

       <b>require_grid</b> <b>&lt;grid_name&gt;</b>
              Checks the availability of the grid &lt;grid_name&gt;. If it is not found, then all <u>accept</u>/<u>expect</u>  pairs
              until  the  next <u>operation</u> will be skipped.  <u>require_grid</u> can be repeated several times to specify
              several grids whose presence is required.

       <b>echo</b> <b>&lt;text&gt;</b>
              Add user defined text to the output stream. See the example below.

                 &lt;gie&gt;
                 echo ** Mercator projection tests **
                 operation +proj=merc
                 accept  0   0
                 expect  0   0
                 &lt;/gie&gt;

              which returns

                 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 Reading file 'test.gie'
                 ** Mercator projection test **
                 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 total:  1 tests succeeded,  0 tests skipped,  0 tests failed.
                 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       <b>skip</b>   Skip any test after the first occurrence of <u>skip</u>. In the example below only the first test will be
              performed. The second test is skipped. This feature is mostly relevant for debugging when  writing
              new test cases.

                 &lt;gie&gt;
                 operation proj=merc
                 accept  0   0
                 expect  0   0
                 skip
                 accept  0   1
                 expect  0   110579.9
                 &lt;/gie&gt;

</pre><h4><b>STRICT</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       New in version 7.1.

       A  stricter  variant  of  normal gie syntax can be used by wrapping gie commands between <b>&lt;gie-strict&gt;</b> and
       <b>&lt;/gie-strict&gt;</b>. In strict mode, comment lines must start with a sharp character. Unknown commands will  be
       considered  as  an error.  A command can still be split on several lines, but intermediate lines must end
       with the space character followed by backslash to mark the continuation.

              &lt;gie-strict&gt;
              # This is a comment. The following line with multiple repeated characters too
              -------------------------------------------------
              # A command on several lines must use " \" continuation
              operation proj=hgridshift +grids=nzgd2kgrid0005.gsb \
                        ellps=GRS80
              tolerance 1 mm
              ignore    pjd_err_failed_to_load_grid
              accept    172.999892181021551 -45.001620431954613
              expect    173                 -45
              &lt;/gie-strict&gt;

</pre><h4><b>BACKGROUND</b></h4><pre>
       More importantly than being an acronym for "Geospatial Integrity  Investigation  Environment",  gie  were
       also  the  initials,  user  id, and USGS email address of Gerald Ian Evenden (1935--2016), the geospatial
       visionary, who, already in the 1980s, started what was to become the PROJ of today.

       Gerald's clear vision was that map projections are <u>just</u> <u>special</u> <u>functions</u>.  Some of them rather  complex,
       most  of them of two variables, but all of them <u>just</u> <u>special</u> <u>functions</u>, and not particularly more special
       than the <b>sin()</b>, <b>cos()</b>, <b>tan()</b>, and <b>hypot()</b> already available in the C standard library.

       And hence, according to Gerald, <u>they</u> <u>should</u> <u>not</u> <u>be</u> <u>particularly</u> <u>much</u> <u>harder</u> <u>to</u>  <u>use</u>,  for  a  programmer,
       than the <b>sin()</b>'s, <b>tan()</b>'s and <b>hypot()</b>'s so readily available.

       Gerald's ingenuity also showed in the implementation of the vision, where he devised a comprehensive, yet
       simple, system of key-value pairs for parameterising a map projection, and the highly flexible <u>PJ</u> struct,
       storing run-time compiled versions of those key-value pairs, hence making a map projection function call,
       <b>pj_fwd(PJ,</b> <b>point)</b>, as easy as a traditional function call like <b>hypot(x,y)</b>.

       While  today,  we  may  have  more  formally  well  defined metadata systems (most prominent the OGC WKT2
       representation), nothing comes close being as easily readable ("human compatible") as Gerald's  key-value
       system.  This  system  in  particular,  and the PROJ system in general, was Gerald's great gift to anyone
       using and/or communicating about geodata.

       It is only reasonable to name a program, keeping an eye on the integrity of the PROJ system, in honour of
       Gerald.

       So in honour, and hopefully also in  the  spirit,  of  Gerald  Ian  Evenden  (1935--2016),  this  is  the
       Geospatial Integrity Investigation Environment.
