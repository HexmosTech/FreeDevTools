</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       resize - set environment and terminal settings to current xterm window size

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>resize</b> [ <b>-v</b> | <b>-u</b> | <b>-c</b> ] [ <b>-s</b> [ <u>row</u> <u>col</u> ] ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Resize</u>  prints  a shell command for setting the appropriate environment variables to indicate the current
       size of <u>xterm</u> window from which the command is run.

       <u>Resize</u> determines the command through several steps:

       •   first, it finds the name of the user's shell program.  It uses the <b>SHELL</b> variable if  set,  otherwise
           it uses the user's data from /etc/passwd.

       •   then  it  decides  whether to use Bourne shell syntax or C-Shell syntax.  It uses a built-in table of
           known shells, which can be overridden by the <b>-u</b> and <b>-c</b> options.

       •   then <u>resize</u> asks the operating system for the terminal settings.  This is the same information  which
           can be manipulated using <u>stty</u>.

       •   then  <u>resize</u>  asks  the  terminal for its size in characters.  Depending on whether the "<b>-s</b> option is
           given, <u>resize</u> uses a different escape sequence to ask for this information.

       •   at this point, <u>resize</u> attempts to update the terminal settings to reflect the terminal window's  size
           in pixels:

           •   if the <b>-s</b> option is used, <u>resize</u> then asks the terminal for its size in pixels.

           •   otherwise,  <u>resize</u>  asks the operating system for the information and updates that after ensuring
               that the window's dimensions are a multiple of the character height and width.

           •   in either case, the updated terminal settings are done using a different system  call  than  used
               for <u>stty</u>.

       •   then  <u>resize</u>  updates the terminal settings to reflect any altered values such as its size in rows or
           columns.  This affects the values shown by <u>stty</u>.

       •   finally, <u>resize</u> generates shell commands for setting the environment variables, and  writes  that  to
           the standard output.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options may be used with <u>resize</u>:

       <b>-c</b>      This  option indicates that C shell commands should be generated even if the user's current shell
               does not appear to use C shell syntax.

       <b>-s</b> [<u>rows</u> <u>columns</u>]
               This option indicates that Sun console escape sequences will be used instead of  the  VT100-style
               <u>xterm</u>  escape  codes.   If <u>rows</u> and <u>columns</u> are given, <u>resize</u> will ask the <u>xterm</u> to resize itself
               using those values.

               Both of the escape sequences used for this option (first to obtain the window size and second  to
               modify  it)  are subject to <u>xterm</u>'s <b>allowWindowOps</b> resource setting.  The window manager may also
               choose to disallow the change.

               The  VT100-style  escape  sequence  used  to  determine  the  screen  size   always   works   for
               VT100-compatible terminals.  VT100s have no corresponding way to modify the screensize.

       <b>-u</b>      This  option  indicates that Bourne shell commands should be generated even if the user's current
               shell does not appear to use Bourne shell syntax.

       <b>-v</b>      This causes <u>resize</u> to print a version number to the standard output, and then exit.

       Note that the Sun console escape sequences are recognized by XFree86 <u>xterm</u> and  by  <u>dtterm</u>.   The  <u>resize</u>
       program may be installed as <u>sunsize</u>, which causes makes it assume the <b>-s</b> option.

       The  <u>rows</u> and <u>columns</u> arguments must appear last; though they are normally associated with the <b>-s</b> option,
       they are parsed separately.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       SHELL          Unless overridden by the <b>-c</b> option, <u>resize</u> determines the user's current shell by

                      •   first checking if <b>$SHELL</b> is set, and using that,

                      •   otherwise <u>resize</u> looks in the password file (<a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>).

                      Generally Bourne-shell variants (including <u>ksh</u>) do not modify <b>$SHELL</b>, so  it  is  possible
                      for <u>resize</u> to be confused if one runs <u>resize</u> from a Bourne shell spawned from a C shell.

                      After  determining  the  user's  shell, <u>resize</u>  checks the shell's name against a table of
                      known shell names.  If it does not find the name in its table, <u>resize</u>  will  use  C  shell
                      syntax for the generated commands to set environment variables.

       TERM           <u>Resize</u>'s generated shell command sets this to "xterm" if not already set.

       TERMCAP        <u>Resize</u>'s  generated  shell command sets this variable on systems using termcap, e.g., when
                      <u>resize</u> is linked with the <u>termcap</u> library rather than a <u>terminfo</u> library.  The latter does
                      not provide the complete text for a termcap entry.

       COLUMNS, LINES <u>Resize</u>'s generated shell command sets these variables on  systems  using  terminfo.   Many
                      applications (including the curses library) use those variables when set to override their
                      screensize.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/termcap   for the base termcap entry to modify.

       <a href="file:~/.cshrc">~/.cshrc</a>       user's alias for the command.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       For  <u>resize</u>'s output to take effect, <u>resize</u> must either be evaluated as part of the command line (usually
       done with a shell alias or function) or else redirected to a file which can then be read in.  From the  C
       shell (usually known as <u>/bin/csh</u>), the following alias could be defined in the user's <u>.cshrc</u>:

           % alias rs 'set noglob; eval `resize`'

       After resizing the window, the user would type:

           % rs

       Users  of  versions of the Bourne shell (usually known as <u><a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a></u>) that don't have command functions will
       need to send the output to a temporary file and then read it back in with the “.” command:

           $ resize &gt; /tmp/out
           $ . /tmp/out
