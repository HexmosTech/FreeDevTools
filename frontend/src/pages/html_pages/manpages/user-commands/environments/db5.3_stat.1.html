</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       db5.3_stat - Display statistics for Berkeley DB environments

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>db5.3_stat</b> -d file [-fN] [-h home] [-P password] [-s database]

       <b>db5.3_stat</b> [-cEelmNrtVZ] [-C Aclop] [-h home] [-L A] [-M A] [-R A] [-P password]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The db5.3_stat utility displays statistics for Berkeley DB environments.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-C</b>     Display  internal  information about the locking subsystem.  (The output from this option is often
              both voluminous and meaningless, and is intended only for debugging.)

              A      Display all information.

              c      Display lock conflict matrix.

              l      Display lockers within hash chains.

              o      Display lock objects within hash chains.

              p      Display locking subsystem parameters.

       <b>-c</b>     Display locking subsystem statistics, as described in DB_ENV-&gt;lock_stat.

       <b>-d</b>     Display database statistics for the specified file, as described in DB-&gt;stat.

              If the database contains multiple databases and the <b>-s</b> flag is not specified, the  statistics  are
              for  the  internal  database that describes the other databases the file contains, and not for the
              file as a whole.

       <b>-E</b>     Display internal information about the database environment, including all  configured  subsystems
              of  the  database  environment.   (The  output  from  this  option  is  often  both voluminous and
              meaningless, and is intended only for debugging.)

       <b>-e</b>     Display information about the database environment, including all  configured  subsystems  of  the
              database environment.

       <b>-f</b>     Display only those database statistics that can be acquired without traversing the database.

       <b>-h</b>     Specify  a  home directory for the database environment; by default, the current working directory
              is used.

       <b>-l</b>     Display logging subsystem statistics, as described in DB_ENV-&gt;log_stat.

       <b>-M</b>     Display internal information about the  cache.   (The  output  from  this  option  is  often  both
              voluminous and meaningless, and is intended only for debugging.)

              A      Display all information.

              h      Display buffers within hash chains.

       <b>-m</b>     Display cache statistics, as described in DB_ENV-&gt;memp_stat.

       <b>-N</b>     Do  not  acquire  shared  region mutexes while running.  Other problems, such as potentially fatal
              errors in Berkeley DB, will be ignored as well.   This  option  is  intended  only  for  debugging
              errors, and should not be used under any other circumstances.

       <b>-P</b>     Specify  an  environment  password.   Although Berkeley DB utilities overwrite password strings as
              soon as possible, be aware there may be a window of vulnerability on  systems  where  unprivileged
              users  can  see  command-line  arguments  or  where utilities are not able to overwrite the memory
              containing the command-line arguments.

       <b>-R</b>     Display internal information about the replication subsystem.  (The output  from  this  option  is
              often both voluminous and meaningless, and is intended only for debugging.)

              A      Display all information.

       <b>-r</b>     Display replication statistics, as described in DB_ENV-&gt;rep_stat.

       <b>-s</b>     Display statistics for the specified database contained in the file specified with the <b>-d</b> flag.

       <b>-t</b>     Display transaction subsystem statistics, as described in DB_ENV-&gt;txn_stat.

       <b>-V</b>     Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.

       <b>-Z</b>     Reset the statistics after reporting them; valid only with the <b>-C</b>, <b>-c</b>, <b>-E</b>, <b>-e</b>, <b>-L</b>, <b>-l</b>, <b>-M</b>, <b>-m</b>, <b>-R</b>,
              <b>-r</b>, and <b>-t</b> options.

       Values  normally  displayed  in  quantities  of  bytes  are displayed as a combination of gigabytes (GB),
       megabytes (MB), kilobytes (KB), and bytes (B).  Otherwise, values smaller than 10 million  are  displayed
       without  any  special  notation,  and values larger than 10 million are displayed as a number followed by
       "M".

       The db5.3_stat utility may be used with a Berkeley DB environment (as described for the  <b>-h</b>  option,  the
       environment  variable  <b>DB_HOME</b>,  or  because  the utility was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB
       environment).  In order to avoid environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB environment,  db5.3_stat
       should  always  be  given  the  chance  to  detach  from  the  environment and exit gracefully.  To cause
       db5.3_stat to release all environment resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal (SIGINT).

       The db5.3_stat utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DB_HOME</b>
              If the <b>-h</b> option is not specified and the environment variable DB_HOME is set, it is used  as  the
              path of the database home, as described in DB_ENV-&gt;open.
