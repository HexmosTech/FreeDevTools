       pamcrater - create cratered terrain by fractal forgery

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pamcrater</b>

       [<b>-number</b> <u>n</u>]

       [<b>-height</b> <u>pixels</u>]

       [<b>-width</b> <u>pixels</u>]

       [<b>-randomseed=</b><u>integer</u>]

       [<b>-verbose</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program is part of <b><a href="../man1/Netpbm.1.html">Netpbm</a></b>(1).

       <b>pamcrater</b>  creates  a  PAM  image  which  is a terrain map (not a visual image) of cratered terrain.  The
       terrain is as if a given number of impacts into a surface create craters with random position and size.

       The size distribution of the craters is based on a power law which results in  many  more  small  craters
       than large ones.  The number of craters of a given size varies as the reciprocal of the area as described
       on pages 31 and 32 of Peitgen and Saupe[1]; cratered bodies in the Solar System are observed to obey this
       relationship.   The formula used to obtain crater radii governed by this law from a uniformly distributed
       pseudorandom sequence was developed by Rudy Rucker.

       A terrain map is a two dimensional map of terrain elevations.  the PAM image that <b>pamcrater</b>  produces  is
       therefore not a visual image but a depth-one image of tuple type "elevation", with the sample value being
       proportional to an elevation.

       You can visualize the terrain map by generating a shaded relief image of it with <b>pamshadedrelief</b>.

       High  resolution  images  with large numbers of craters often benefit from being piped through <b>pnmsmooth</b>.
       The averaging performed by this process  eliminates  some  of  the  jagged  pixels  and  lends  a  mellow
       ``telescopic image'' feel to the overall picture.

       <b>pamcrater</b>  generates  only  small  craters, which are hemispherical in shape (regardless of the incidence
       angle of the impacting body, as long as the velocity is  sufficiently  high).   Large  craters,  such  as
       Copernicus and Tycho on the Moon, have a ``walled plain'' shape with a cross-section more like:

                       /\                            /\
                 _____/  \____________/\____________/  \_____

       Larger  craters  should  really  use this profile, including the central peak, and totally obliterate the
       pre-existing terrain.

       The maxval of the PAM image is always 65535.

       The randomness in the image is limited before Netpbm 10.37 (December 2006) --  if  you  run  the  program
       twice in the same second, you may get identical output.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In  addition  to  the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most notably <b>-quiet</b>, see  Common
       Options ), <b>pamcrater</b> recognizes the following command line options:

       All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.

       <b>-number</b> <u>n</u>
              This causes <b>pamcrater</b> to generate <u>n</u> craters.  If you do not specify <b>-number</b>,  it  generates  50000
              craters.   Don't  expect  to  see them all!  For every large crater there are many, many more tiny
              ones which tend simply to erode the landscape.  In general, the more craters you specify, the more
              realistic the result; ideally you want the entire terrain to have  been  extensively  turned  over
              again  and  again by cratering.  High resolution images containing five to ten million craters are
              stunning but take longer to create.

       <b>-height</b> <u>height</u>
              This sets the height of the generated image to <u>height</u> pixels.  The default height is 256 pixels.

       <b>-width</b> <u>width</u>
              This sets the width of the generated image to <u>width</u> pixels.  The default width is 256 pixels.

       <b>-randomseed=</b><u>integer</u>
              This is the seed for the random number generator that generates the pixels.

              Use this to ensure you get the same image on separate invocations.

              By default, <b>pamcrater</b> uses a seed derived from the time of day and process  ID,  which  gives  you
              fairly uncorrelated results in multiple invocations.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.61 (December 2012).

       <b>-verbose</b>
              This causes <b>pamcrater</b> to issue additional messages about what it is doing.

              This option was new in Neptbm 10.69 (December 2014).

           $ pamcrater | pamshadedrelief | pamx

           $ pamcrater -number=500000 -height=1000 -width=1000 &gt;craters.pam

</pre><h4><b>DESIGN</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Real craters have two distinct morphologies.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       John  Walker  wrote  <b>pgmcrater</b>  in  1991 and it was included in Pbmplus.  <b>pgmcrater</b> did the equivalent of
       pamcrater | pamshadedrelief.  In Netpbm 10.68 (September 2014), Bryan Henderson split  the  functions  of
       <b>pgmcrater</b>  into  two  programs, one (<b>pamcrater</b>) to compute elevations, and the other (<b>pamshadedrelief</b>) to
       generate a shaded relief visual image showing those elevations.  Bryan did this because  it  is  more  in
       keeping  with  Netpbm's  modular architecture, and because the <b>pamshadedrelief</b> might be useful with other
       inputs.

       (Like all Netpbm programs, <b>pgmcrater</b> was not  static  between  the  two  events  described  above;  minor
       changes, including replacement of most of the code, happened in between).

       The original 1991 <b>pgmcrater</b> manual contains the following:
