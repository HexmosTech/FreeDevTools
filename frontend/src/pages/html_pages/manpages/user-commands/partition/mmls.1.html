</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mmls - Display the partition layout of a volume system  (partition tables)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mmls</b> <b>[-t</b> <u>mmtype</u> <b>]</b> <b>[-o</b> <u>offset</u> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <b>-i</b> <u>imgtype</u> <b>]</b> <b>[-b</b> <b>dev_sector_size]</b> <b>[-BrvV]</b> <b>[-aAmM]</b> <u>image</u> <u>[images]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mmls</b>  displays  the  layout of the partitions in a volume system, which include partition tables and disk
       labels.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       -t mmtype
              Specify the media management type.  Use '-t list' to list the  supported  types.   If  not  given,
              autodetection methods are used.

       -o offset
              Specify  the  offset  into the image where the volume containing the partition system starts.  The
              relative offset of the partition system will be added to this value.

       -b dev_sector_size
              The size, in bytes, of the underlying device sectors.  If not given, the value in the image format
              is used (if it exists) or 512-bytes is assumed.

       -i imgtype
              Identify the type of image file, such as raw.  Use '-i list' to list the supported types.  If  not
              given, autodetection methods are used.

       -B     Include a column with the partition sizes in bytes

       -r     Recurse  into  DOS  partitions  and look for other partition tables.  This setup frequently occurs
              when Unix is installed on x86 systems.

       -v     Verbose output of debugging statements to stderr

       -V     Display version

       -a     Show allocated volumes

       -A     Show unallocated volumes

       -m     Show metadata volumes

       -M     Hide metadata volumes

       image [images]
              The disk or partition image to read, whose format is given with '-i'.  Multiple image  file  names
              can  be  given if the image is split into multiple segments.  If only one image file is given, and
              its name is the first in a sequence (e.g., as indicated by ending  in  '.001'),  subsequent  image
              segments will be included automatically.

       'mmls' is similar to 'fdisk -lu' in Linux with a few differences.  Namely, it will show which sectors are
       not  being used so that those can be searched for hidden data.  It also gives the length value so that it
       can be plugged into 'dd' more easily for extracting the partitions.  It also will show  BSD  disk  labels
       for Free, Open, and NetBSD and will display the output in sectors and not cylinders.  Lastly, it works on
       non-Linux systems.

       If  none  of -a, -A, -m, or -M are given then all volume types will be listed.  If any of them are given,
       then only the types specified on the command line will be listed.

       Allocated volumes are those that are listed in a partition table in the volume system AND can store data.
       Unallocated volumes are virtually created by mmls to show you which sectors have not been allocated to  a
       volume.   The  metadata  volumes  overlap  the  allocated  and unallocated volumes and describe where the
       partition tables and other metadata structures are located.  In some volume systems, these structures are
       in allocated space and in others they are in unallocated space.  In some volume systems,  their  location
       is explicitly given in the partition tables and in others they are not.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To list the partition table of a Windows system using autodetect:

       # mmls disk_image.dd

       To list the contents of a BSD system that starts in sector 12345 of a split image:

       # mmls -t bsd -o 12345 -i split disk-1.dd disk-2.dd
