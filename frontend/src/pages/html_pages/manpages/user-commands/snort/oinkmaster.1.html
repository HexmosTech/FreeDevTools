</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>oinkmaster</b> - update Snort signatures

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>oinkmaster</b> <b>-o</b> <u>outdir</u> [options]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Oinkmaster  is  simple  tool  that  helps  you  keep  your  Snort  rules  current  with little or no user
       interaction. It downloads a tarball containing the new rules and can then enable, disable  or  even  make
       arbitrary modifications to specified rules before updating your local rules files.  It will also tell you
       the exact changes from your previous rules.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  only required argument to Oinkmaster is <b>-o</b> <u>outdir</u> where <u>outdir</u> is the directory to put the new rules
       files in. This should be where you keep your rules locally. The downloaded files will be compared to  the
       ones in here before possibly overwriting them.

       Optional arguments:

       <b>-b</b> <u>dir</u> If the rules have been modified, a tarball of your old rules will be put in <u>dir</u> before overwriting
              them  with  the new files. No backup is done if no file has changed or if Oinkmaster is running in
              careful mode.

       <b>-c</b>     Run in careful mode. This means that Oinkmaster will only check for updates and  print  them,  but
              not update anything.

       <b>-C</b> <u>cfg</u> Use  this  configuration  file  instead of the default.  If not specified, oinkmaster.conf will be
              looked for in <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> and then <a href="file:/usr/local/etc/.">/usr/local/etc/.</a>  You can specify multiple <b>-C</b> <u>cfg</u>  to  load  multiple
              configuration files.  They will be loaded in order of appearance on the command line. If an option
              is  redefined, it overrides the previous value (except for the "url" option, as you are allowed to
              specify multiple URLs).

       <b>-e</b>     Enable rules that are disabled by default in the downloaded rules  archive  by  removing  all  the
              leading  "#"  from  them.  If there are any disabled rules in the archive, they will stay that way
              unless you use this option.  Remember that they are disabled for  a  reason  (they  may  not  even
              work), so use this option with care.

       <b>-h</b>     Show valid command line arguments with short descriptions

       <b>-i</b>     Enable  interactive  mode.  You  will  be  asked  to  approve the changes (if any) before updating
              anything.

       <b>-m</b>     Minimize/simplify the diff when printing result for modified rules by removing common leading  and
              trailing  parts  of the old and new rule so it's easier to see the actual change. A few characters
              to the left and to the right of the change are also printed so you  get  some  context.   The  rev
              keyword  is  ignored when the comparison and removal of common parts is performed because it would
              often make the whole idea fail.  (If you feel it's important to be able to  verify  that  the  rev
              number has increased when a rule has been updated, do not use the minimized diff mode.)

              Normally  when  a  rule  has  changed  the entire old and new versions are printed, but the actual
              change between them can be hard to see if the rules are long, complex and many.

              The normal output could look like this:

              Old: alert tcp any any -&gt; any 22 (msg: "foo"; flags: A+; rev:1;)
              New: alert tcp any any -&gt; any 123 (msg: "foo"; flags: A+; rev:2;)

              When using <b>-m</b> it would instead look something like:

              Old: ...any any -&gt; any 22 (msg: "foo";...
              New: ...any any -&gt; any 123 (msg: "foo";...

       <b>-q</b>     Run in quiet mode. Nothing is printed unless there are changes in the rules or if there are errors
              or warnings.

       <b>-Q</b>     Run in super-quiet mode. This is the same as <b>-q</b> but even more quiet when printing the results (the
              "None." stuff is not printed). It will also suppress some other warning messages such as those for
              duplicate SIDs and non-matching modifysid expressions.

       <b>-r</b>     Check for rules files that exist in the output directory but not in the downloaded rules  archive,
              i.e. files that may have been removed from the distribution archive.

       <b>-s</b>     Leave  out  details  when  printing  results  (aka  bmc mode).  This means that the entire added /
              removed / modified rules will not be printed, just their SID and msg string,  plus  the  filename.
              Non-rule  changes  are  printed as usual. This output mode could be useful for example if you send
              the output by email to people who don't really care about the details of the rules, just the  fact
              that they have been updated. Example output when running with <b>-s</b>

              [+++]          Added rules:          [+++]

                  1607 - WEB-CGI HyperSeek hsx.cgi access (web-cgi.rules)
                  1775 - MYSQL root login attempt (mysql.rules)

              [///]     Modified active rules:     [///]

                   302 - EXPLOIT Redhat 7.0 lprd overflow (exploit.rules)
                   304 - EXPLOIT SCO calserver overflow (exploit.rules)
                   305 - EXPLOIT delegate proxy overflow (exploit.rules)
                   306 - EXPLOIT VQServer admin (exploit.rules)

       <b>-S</b> <u>file</u>
              Used  in  conjuction  with with <b>-U</b> to specify which file(s) in the downloaded archive(s) to search
              for new variables. When not specified, snort.conf is checked.  You may specify multiple <b>-S</b> <u>file</u> to
              search for new variables in multiple files.

       <b>-T</b>     Check the configuration file(s) for fatal errors and then exit.   Possible  warning  messages  are
              printed as well.

       <b>-u</b> <u>url</u> Download  the  rules archive from <u>url</u> instead of the location specified in the configuration file.
              It must start with file://, ftp://, http://, https:// or scp:// and end with ".tar.gz" or  ".tgz".
              The  file  must  be  a gzipped tarball containing a directory named "rules", holding all the rules
              files. It must  not  contain  any  symlinks.  You  can  also  point  to  a  local  directory  with
              dir://&lt;directory&gt;.  For  the  official Snort rules, the URL to use depends on the version of Snort
              you run and it might also require registration.  Visit the rules download section at the Snort web
              site to find the right URL and more information. Remember to update the URL when  upgrading  to  a
              new major version of Snort.

              You  may  specify  multiple  <b>-u</b>  <u>url</u> to grab multiple rules archives from different locations. All
              rules files in the archives will be put in the same output  directory  so  if  the  same  filename
              exists  in  multiple  archives,  Oinkmaster  will print an error message and exit. That's why it's
              usually recommended to  instead  run  Oinkmaster  once  for  each  URL  and  use  separate  output
              directories. If <b>-u</b> <u>url</u> is specified, it overrides any URLs specified in the configuration file(s).
              Note  that  if  multiple  URLs  are  specified  and  one  of  them is broken, Oinkmaster will exit
              immediately without further processing. This can be good or bad, depending on the situation.

       <b>-U</b> <u>file</u>
              Variables (i.e. "var foo bar" lines) that exist in downloaded snort.conf but not in <u>file</u>  will  be
              added to <u>file</u> right after any other variables it may contain.  Modified existing variables are not
              merged, only new ones.  <u>file</u> is normally your production copy of snort.conf (which should not be a
              file  that  is  updated  by  Oinkmaster  the  normal  way).  This feature is to prevent Snort from
              breaking in case there are new variables added in the downloaded rules, as Snort can not start  if
              the  rules  use  variables  that  aren't  defined  anywhere.  By  default when using <b>-U</b> , the file
              snort.conf in the downloaded archive is search for new variables but you can  override  this  with
              the <b>-S</b> <u>file</u> argument. If you download from multiple URLs, Oinkmaster will look for a snort.conf in
              each downloaded rules archive.

       <b>-v</b>     Run  in  verbose/debug mode. Should probably only be used in case you need to debug your settings,
              like verifying complex modifysid statements.  It will also tell you if you try to use "disablesid"
              on non-existent SIDs. Warnings about using enablesid/localsid/modifysid on non-existent  SIDs  are
              always  printed  unless  running  in  quiet  mode,  as  those  are  usually  more important (using
              "disablesid" on a non-existent rule is a NOOP anyway).

       <b>-V</b>     Show version and exit.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Download rules archive from default location specified in  oinkmaster.conf  and  put  the  new  rules  in
       /etc/rules/:

           <b>oinkmaster</b> <b>-o</b> <b>/etc/rules</b>

       Grab rules archive from local filesystem and do not print anything unless it contains updated rules:

           <b>oinkmaster</b> <b>-u</b> <b>file:///tmp/rules.tar.gz</b> <b>-o</b> <b>/etc/rules</b> <b>-q</b>

       Download  rules  archive  from default location, make backup of old rules if there were updates, and send
       output by e-mail. (Note however that if you plan on distributing files  with  Oinkmaster  that  could  be
       considered  sensitive,  such  as  Snort  configuration files containing database passwords, you should of
       course not send the output by e-mail without first encrypting the content.):

           <b>oinkmaster</b> <b>-o</b> <b>/etc/snort/rules</b> <b>-b</b> <b>/etc/snort/backup</b> <b>2&gt;&amp;1</b> <b>|</b> \
           <b>mail</b> <b>-s</b> <b>"subject"</b> <b><a href="mailto:user@example.com">user@example.com</a></b>

       Grab three different rules archives and merge variables that exist in downloaded snort.conf and  foo.conf
       but not in local /etc/snort/snort.conf:

           <b>oinkmaster</b> <b>-u</b> <b>file:///tmp/foo.rules.tar.gz</b> \
           <b>-u</b> <b><a href="http://somewhere/rules.tar.gz">http://somewhere/rules.tar.gz</a></b> <b>-u</b> <b>https://blah/rules.tar.gz</b> \
           <b>-o</b> <b>/etc/rules</b> <b>-S</b> <b>snort.conf</b> <b>-S</b> <b>foo.conf</b> <b>-U</b> <b>/etc/snort/snort.conf</b>

       Load  settings  from  two different files, use scp to download rules archive from a remote host where you
       have put the rules archive, merge variables from downloaded snort.conf, and send results by  e-mail  only
       if  anything  changed  or  if  there  were  any  error  messages. It assumes that the "mktemp" command is
       available on the system:

           <b>TMP=`mktemp</b> <b>/tmp/oinkmaster.XXXXXX`</b> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> \
           <b>(oinkmaster</b> <b>-C</b> <b>/etc/oinkmaster-global.conf</b> \
           <b>-C</b> <b>/etc/oinkmaster-sensor.conf</b> <b>-o</b> <b>/etc/rules</b> \
           <b>-U</b> <b>/etc/snort.conf</b> \
           <b>-u</b> <b>scp://<a href="mailto:user@example.com">user@example.com</a>:/home/user/rules.tar.gz</b> \
           <b>&gt;</b> <b>$TMP</b> <b>2&gt;&amp;1;</b> <b>if</b> <b>[</b> <b>-s</b> <b>$TMP</b> <b>];</b> <b>then</b> <b>mail</b> <b>-s</b> <b>"subject"</b> \
           <b><a href="mailto:you@example.com">you@example.com</a></b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>$TMP;</b> <b>fi;</b> <b>rm</b> <b>$TMP)</b>

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/etc/oinkmaster.conf</b>
       <b>/usr/local/etc/oinkmaster.conf</b>

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       If you find a bug, report it by e-mail to the author. Always include as much information as possible.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The initial version was released in early 2001 under the name arachnids_upd.  It  worked  only  with  the
       ArachNIDS  Snort  rules, but as times changed, it was rewritten to work with the official Snort rules and
       the new name became Oinkmaster.
