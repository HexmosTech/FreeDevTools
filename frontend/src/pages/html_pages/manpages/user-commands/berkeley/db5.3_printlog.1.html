</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       db5.3_printlog - Dumps Berkeley DB log files in a human-readable format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>db5.3_printlog</b> [-NrV] [-b start-LSN] [-e stop-LSN] [-h home] [-P password]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  db5.3_printlog  utility  is a debugging utility that dumps Berkeley DB log files in a human-readable
       format.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-b</b>     Display log records starting at log sequence number (LSN) <b>start-LSN</b>; <b>start-LSN</b> is specified  as  a
              file  number, followed by a slash (/) character, followed by an offset number, with no intervening
              whitespace.

       <b>-e</b>     Stop displaying log records at log sequence number (LSN) <b>stop-LSN</b>; <b>stop-LSN</b> is specified as a file
              number, followed by a slash (/) character, followed by  an  offset  number,  with  no  intervening
              whitespace.

       <b>-h</b>     Specify  a  home directory for the database environment; by default, the current working directory
              is used.

       <b>-N</b>     Do not acquire shared region mutexes while running.  Other problems,  such  as  potentially  fatal
              errors  in  Berkeley  DB,  will  be  ignored  as well.  This option is intended only for debugging
              errors, and should not be used under any other circumstances.

       <b>-P</b>     Specify an environment password.  Although Berkeley DB utilities  overwrite  password  strings  as
              soon  as  possible,  be aware there may be a window of vulnerability on systems where unprivileged
              users can see command-line arguments or where utilities are  not  able  to  overwrite  the  memory
              containing the command-line arguments.

       <b>-r</b>     Read the log files in reverse order.

       <b>-V</b>     Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.

       The  db5.3_printlog  utility  uses  a  Berkeley  DB  environment  (as  described  for  the <b>-h</b> option, the
       environment variable <b>DB_HOME</b>, or because the utility was run in a  directory  containing  a  Berkeley  DB
       environment).   In  order  to  avoid  environment  corruption  when  using  a  Berkeley  DB  environment,
       db5.3_printlog should always be given the chance to detach from the environment and exit gracefully.   To
       cause  db5.3_printlog  to release all environment resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal
       (SIGINT).

       The db5.3_printlog utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DB_HOME</b>
              If the <b>-h</b> option is not specified and the environment variable DB_HOME is set, it is used  as  the
              path of the database home, as described in DB_ENV-&gt;open.
