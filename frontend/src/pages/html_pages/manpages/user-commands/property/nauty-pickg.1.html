       nauty-pickg - select graphs according to a variety of properties

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>[pickg|countg]</b> [<u>-fp#:#q</u> <u>-V</u>] [<u>--keys</u>] [<u>-constraints</u> <u>-v</u>] [<u>ifile</u> [<u>ofile</u>]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
              countg : Count graphs according to their properties.

              pickg : Select graphs according to their properties.

              ifile, ofile : Input and output files.

              '-' and missing names imply stdin and stdout.

              Miscellaneous switches:

       <b>-p</b># <b>-p</b>#:#
              Specify range of input lines (first is 1) May fail if input is incremental.

       <b>-f</b>     With <b>-p</b>, assume input lines of fixed length (only used with a file in graph6/digraph6 format)

       <b>-v</b>     Negate all constraints (but not <b>-p</b>)

       <b>-X</b>     Reverse selection (but <b>-p</b> still observed)

       <b>-V</b>     List properties of every input matching constraints.

       <b>-l</b>     Put a blank line whenever the first parameter changes, if there are at least two parameters.

       <b>-1</b>     Write  output  as lines of numbers separated by spaces, with 0/1 for boolean and both endpoints of
              ranges given separately even if they are the same, and the count at the end of the line. Also,  no
              total is written.

       <b>-2</b>     The same as <b>-1</b> but counts are not written.

       <b>-q</b>     Suppress informative output.

              Constraints:

              Numerical  constraints  (shown  here with following #) can take a single integer value, or a range
              like #:#, #:, or :#.  Each can also be preceded by '~', which negates it.   (For  example,  -~D2:4
              will  match  any  maximum degree which is _not_ 2, 3, or 4.)  Constraints are applied to all input
              graphs, and only those which match all constraints are counted or selected.

       <b>-n</b>#    number of vertices           <b>-e</b>#  number of edges

       <b>-ee</b># number of non-edges (including loops for digraphs)

       <b>-L</b>#    number of loops              <b>-C</b>   strongly connected

       <b>-T</b>#    number of triangles          <b>-K</b>#  number of maximal cliques

       <b>-TT</b># number independent 3-sets    <b>-P</b>#
              number of 5-cycles

       <b>-B</b>#    smallest possible first side of a bipartition (0 if nonbipartite)

       <b>-H</b>#    number of induced cycles     <b>-W</b>#  number of 4-cycles

       <b>-E</b>     Eulerian (all degrees are even, connectivity not required)

       <b>-a</b>#    group size  <b>-o</b># orbits  <b>-F</b># fixed points  <b>-t</b> vertex-transitive

       <b>-O</b>#    number of orbits of edges    <b>-OO</b># number of orbits of arcs

       <b>-tt</b># 1 = edge transitive, 2 = arc transitive, 0 = neither

       <b>-c</b>#    connectivity (2 means 2 or more).

       <b>-kk</b># #-tree, otherwise 0. The complete graph K_n is tabulated as

              an n-tree, but matches either n-1 or n,

       <b>-i</b>#    min common nbrs of adjacent vertices;     <b>-ii</b># maximum

       <b>-j</b>#    min common nbrs of non-adjacent vertices; <b>-jj</b># maximum

       <b>-x</b>#    number of sources            <b>-xx</b>#  number of sinks

       <b>-WW</b># number of diamonds

       <b>-N</b>#    chromatic number (limited to WORDSIZE colours)

       <b>-NN</b># chromatic index (limited to max degree WORDSIZE-1)

       <b>-AA</b># class (chromatic index - maximum degree + 1)

       <b>-G</b>#    connectivity                 <b>-GG</b># edge connectivity

              Sort keys:

       Counts are made for all graphs passing the constraints.
              Counts

              are given separately for each combination of values occurring for the properties  listed  as  sort
              keys.   A  sort key is introduced by '--' and uses one of the letters known as constraints.  These
              can be combined:  <b>--n</b> <b>--e</b>  <b>--r</b>  is the same as <b>--ne</b> <b>--r</b> and <b>--ner</b>.  The  order  of  sort  keys  is
              significant.  A comma can be used as a separator.

              The  sort key ':' has a special purpose: the values of sort keys following ':' are given as ranges
              rather than creating a separate line for each value. For example <b>--e</b>:zZ will give  the  ranges  of
              radius  and  diameter  that  occur for each number of edges.  The output format matches the input,
              except that sparse6 is used to output an incremental graph whose predecessor is not output.

              Some sort keys have boolean variants with parameters:

       <b>--N</b>#   #-colourable (i.e. chromatic number &lt;= #)

       <b>--A</b>#   #-edge colourable

       <b>--G</b>#   #-connected (i.e. connectivity &gt;= #)

       <b>--GG</b># #-edge connected
