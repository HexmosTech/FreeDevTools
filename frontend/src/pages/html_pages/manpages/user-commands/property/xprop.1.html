       xprop - property displayer for X

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xprop</b>  [-help] [-grammar] [-id <u>id</u>] [-root] [-name <u>name</u>] [-frame] [-font <u>font</u>] [-display <u>display</u>] [-len <u>n</u>]
       [-notype] [-fs <u>file</u>] [-remove <u>property-name</u>] [-set <u>property-name</u> <u>value</u>] [-spy] [-version] [-f <u>atom</u> <u>format</u>
       [<u>dformat</u>]]* [<u>format</u> [<u>dformat</u>] <u>atom</u>]*

</pre><h4><b>SUMMARY</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>xprop</u> utility is for displaying window and font properties in an X server.  One  window  or  font  is
       selected using the command line arguments or possibly in the case of a window, by clicking on the desired
       window.  A list of properties is then given, possibly with formatting information.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-help</b>   Print out a summary of command line options.

       <b>-grammar</b>
               Print out a detailed grammar for all command line options.

       <b>-id</b> <u>id</u>  This  argument  allows  the  user  to  select window <u>id</u> on the command line rather than using the
               pointer to select the target window.  This is very useful in debugging X applications  where  the
               target  window is not mapped to the screen or where the use of the pointer might be impossible or
               interfere with the application.

       <b>-name</b> <u>name</u>
               This argument allows the user to specify that the window named <u>name</u> is the target window  on  the
               command line rather than using the pointer to select the target window.

       <b>-font</b> <u>font</u>
               This argument allows the user to specify that the properties of font <u>font</u> should be displayed.

       <b>-root</b>   This  argument specifies that X's root window is the target window.  This is useful in situations
               where the root window is completely obscured.

       <b>-display</b> <u>display</u>
               This argument allows you to specify the server to connect to; see <u><a href="../man7/X.7.html">X</a>(7)</u>.

       <b>-len</b> <u>n</u>  Specifies that at most <u>n</u> bytes of any property should be read or displayed.

       <b>-notype</b> Specifies that the type of each property should not be displayed.

       <b>-fs</b> <u>file</u>
               Specifies that file <u>file</u> should be used as a source of more formats for properties.

       <b>-frame</b>  Specifies that when selecting a window by hand (i.e. if none of <b>-name</b>, <b>-root</b>, or <b>-id</b> are  given),
               look at the window manager frame (if any) instead of looking for the client window.

       <b>-remove</b> <u>property-name</u>
               Specifies the name of a property to be removed from the indicated window.

       <b>-set</b> <u>property-name</u> <u>value</u>
               Specifies the name of a property and a property value, to be set on the indicated window.

       <b>-spy</b>    Examine window properties forever, looking for property change events.

       <b>-version</b>
               Print program version information and exit.

       <b>-f</b> <u>name</u> <u>format</u> <b>[</b><u>dformat</u><b>]</b>
               Specifies  that  the  <u>format</u>  for  <u>name</u>  should be <u>format</u> and that the <u>dformat</u> for <u>name</u> should be
               <u>dformat</u>.  If <u>dformat</u> is missing, " = $0+\n" is assumed.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       For each of these properties, its value on the selected window or font  is  printed  using  the  supplied
       formatting information if any.  If no formatting information is supplied, internal defaults are used.  If
       a  property is not defined on the selected window or font, "not defined" is printed as the value for that
       property.  If no property list is given, all the properties possessed by the selected window or font  are
       printed.

       A window may be selected in one of four ways.  First, if the desired window is the root window, the -root
       argument  may  be  used.  If the desired window is not the root window, it may be selected in two ways on
       the command line, either by id number such as might be obtained from <u>xwininfo</u>, or by name if  the  window
       possesses  a  name.   The -id argument selects a window by id number in either decimal or hex (must start
       with 0x) while the -name argument selects a window by name.

       The last way to select a window does not involve the command line at all.  If none of -font, -id,  -name,
       and  -root  are specified, a crosshairs cursor is displayed and the user is allowed to choose any visible
       window by pressing any pointer button in the desired window.  If it is desired to display properties of a
       font as opposed to a window, the -font argument must be used.

       Other than the above four arguments and the -help argument for obtaining help, and the -grammar  argument
       for  listing  the  full  grammar  for  the command line, all the other command line arguments are used in
       specifying both the format of the properties to be displayed  and  how  to  display  them.   The  -len  <u>n</u>
       argument specifies that at most <u>n</u> bytes of any given property will be read and displayed.  This is useful
       for  example  when  displaying  the  cut  buffer  on  the root window which could run to several pages if
       displayed in full.

       Normally each property name is displayed by printing first the property name then its  type  (if  it  has
       one) in parentheses followed by its value.  The -notype argument specifies that property types should not
       be  displayed.   The  -fs  argument is used to specify a file containing a list of formats for properties
       while the -f argument is used to specify the format for one property.

       The formatting information for a property actually consists of two parts, a <u>format</u> and  a  <u>dformat</u>.   The
       <u>format</u>  specifies  the actual formatting of the property (i.e., is it made up of words, bytes, or longs?,
       etc.) while the <u>dformat</u> specifies how the property should be displayed.

       The following paragraphs describe how to construct <u>format</u>s and <u>dformat</u>s.  However, for the vast  majority
       of users and uses, this should not be necessary as the built in defaults contain the <u>format</u>s and <u>dformat</u>s
       necessary  to  display  all  the standard properties.  It should only be necessary to specify <u>format</u>s and
       <u>dformat</u>s if a new property is being dealt with or the user dislikes the  standard  display  format.   New
       users especially are encouraged to skip this part.

       A <u>format</u> consists of one of 0, 8, 16, or 32 followed by a sequence of one or more format characters.  The
       0,  8,  16,  or  32  specifies how many bits per field there are in the property.  Zero is a special case
       meaning use the field size information associated with the property itself.  (This  is  only  needed  for
       special  cases  like  type  INTEGER  which is actually three different types depending on the size of the
       fields of the property.)

       A value of 8 means that the property is a sequence of bytes while a value  of  16  would  mean  that  the
       property  is a sequence of words.  The difference between these two lies in the fact that the sequence of
       words will be byte swapped while the sequence of bytes will not be when read by a machine of the opposite
       byte order of the machine that originally wrote the property.  For more information on how properties are
       formatted and stored, consult the Xlib manual.

       Once the size of the fields has been specified, it is necessary to specify the type of each field  (i.e.,
       is  it  an  integer, a string, an atom, or what?)  This is done using one format character per field.  If
       there are more fields in the property than  format  characters  supplied,  the  last  character  will  be
       repeated as many times as necessary for the extra fields.  The format characters and their meaning are as
       follows:

       a      The field holds an atom number.  A field of this type should be of size 32.

       b      The field is an boolean.  A 0 means false while anything else means true.

       c      The field is an unsigned number, a cardinal.

       i      The field is a signed integer.

       m      The field is a set of bit flags, 1 meaning on.

       o      The  field  is  an array of icons, packed as a sequence of 32 bit numbers consisting of the width,
              height and ARGB pixel values, as defined for the _NET_WM_ICON  property  in  the  <u>Extended</u>  <u>Window</u>
              <u>Manager</u> <u>Hints</u> specification.   A field of this type must be of size 32.

       s      This  field  and the next ones until either a 0 or the end of the property represent a sequence of
              bytes.  This format character is only usable with a field size of 8 and  is  most  often  used  to
              represent a string.

       t      This  field  and  the  next  ones  until  either  a  0  or  the  end  of the property represent an
              internationalized text string. This format character is only usable with a field size  of  8.  The
              string  is  assumed  to  be  in an ICCCM compliant encoding and is converted to the current locale
              encoding before being output.

       u      This field and the next ones until either a 0 or the  end  of  the  property  represent  an  UTF-8
              encoded unicode string. This format character is only usable with a field size of 8. If the string
              is  found  to be an invalid character, the type of encoding violation is printed instead, followed
              by the string formatted using 's'. When in an environment not capable of displaying UTF-8  encoded
              string, behaviour is identical to 's'.

       x      The  field  is a hex number (like 'c' but displayed in hex - most useful for displaying window ids
              and the like)

       An example <u>format</u> is 32ica which is the format for a property of three fields of 32 bits each, the  first
       holding a signed integer, the second an unsigned integer, and the third an atom.

       The  format  of  a <u>dformat</u> unlike that of a <u>format</u> is not so rigid.  The only limitations on a <u>dformat</u> is
       that one may not start with a letter or a dash.  This is so that it can be distinguished from a  property
       name  or  an argument.  A <u>dformat</u> is a text string containing special characters instructing that various
       fields be printed at various points in a manner similar to the formatting string  used  by  printf.   For
       example,  the <u>dformat</u> " is ( $0, $1 \)\n" would render the POINT 3, -4 which has a <u>format</u> of 32ii as " is
       ( 3, -4 )\n".

       Any character other than a $, ?, \, or a ( in a <u>dformat</u> prints as itself.  To print out one of $,  ?,  \,
       or  ( precede it by a \.  For example, to print out a $, use \$.  Several special backslash sequences are
       provided as shortcuts.  \n will cause a newline to  be  displayed  while  \t  will  cause  a  tab  to  be
       displayed.  \<u>o</u> where <u>o</u> is an octal number will display character number <u>o</u>.

       A  $  followed  by  a  number <u>n</u> causes field number <u>n</u> to be displayed.  The format of the displayed field
       depends on the formatting character used to describe it in the corresponding <u>format</u>.  I.e., if a cardinal
       is described by 'c' it will print in decimal while if it is described by a 'x' it is displayed in hex.

       If the field is not present in  the  property  (this  is  possible  with  some  properties),  &lt;field  not
       available&gt; is displayed instead.  $<u>n</u>+ will display field number <u>n</u> then a comma then field number <u>n</u>+1 then
       another  comma  then  ... until the last field defined.  If field <u>n</u> is not defined, nothing is displayed.
       This is useful for a property that is a list of values.

       A ? is used to start a conditional expression, a kind of if-then statement.  ?<u>exp</u>(<u>text</u>) will display <u>text</u>
       if and only if <u>exp</u> evaluates to non-zero.  This is useful for two things.  First, it allows fields to  be
       displayed  if  and  only  if  a  flag is set.  And second, it allows a value such as a state number to be
       displayed as a name rather than as just a number.  The syntax of <u>exp</u> is as follows:

       <u>exp</u>    ::= <u>term</u> | <u>term</u>=<u>exp</u> | !<u>exp</u>

       <u>term</u>   ::= <u>n</u> | $<u>n</u> | m<u>n</u>

       The ! operator is a logical ``not'', changing 0 to 1 and any non-zero value  to  0.   =  is  an  equality
       operator.   Note  that  internally  all expressions are evaluated as 32 bit numbers so -1 is not equal to
       65535.  = returns 1 if the two values are equal and 0 if not.  <u>n</u> represents the constant value <u>n</u> while $<u>n</u>
       represents the value of field number <u>n</u>.  m<u>n</u> is 1 if flag number  <u>n</u>  in  the  first  field  having  format
       character 'm' in the corresponding <u>format</u> is 1, 0 otherwise.

       Examples:  ?m3(count:  $3\n)  displays  field 3 with a label of count if and only if flag number 3 (count
       starts at 0!) is on.  ?$2=0(True)?!$2=0(False) displays the inverted value of field 2 as a boolean.

       In order to display a property, <u>xprop</u> needs both a <u>format</u> and a <u>dformat</u>.  Before <u>xprop</u> uses  its  default
       values  of  a  <u>format</u> of 32x and a <u>dformat</u> of " = { $0+ }\n", it searches several places in an attempt to
       find more specific formats.  First, a search is made using the name of the property.  If  this  fails,  a
       search  is  made  using  the type of the property.  This allows type STRING to be defined with one set of
       formats while allowing property WM_NAME which is of type STRING to be defined with  a  different  format.
       In this way, the display formats for a given type can be overridden for specific properties.

       The  locations  searched  are  in  order:  the  format  if any specified with the property name (as in 8x
       WM_NAME), the formats defined by -f options in last to first order, the contents of the file specified by
       the -fs option if any, the contents of the file specified by the environmental variable  XPROPFORMATS  if
       any, and finally <u>xprop</u>'s built in file of formats.

       The  format  of  the  files  referred to by the -fs argument and the XPROPFORMATS variable is one or more
       lines of the following form:

       <u>name</u> <u>format</u> [<u>dformat</u>]

       Where <u>name</u> is either the name of a property or the name of a type, <u>format</u> is the <u>format</u> to be  used  with
       <u>name</u> and <u>dformat</u> is the <u>dformat</u> to be used with <u>name</u>.  If <u>dformat</u> is not present, " = $0+\n" is assumed.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To display the name of the root window: <u>xprop</u> -root WM_NAME

       To display the window manager hints for the clock: <u>xprop</u> -name xclock WM_HINTS

       To display the start of the cut buffer: <u>xprop</u> -root -len 100 CUT_BUFFER0

       To display the point size of the fixed font: <u>xprop</u> -font fixed POINT_SIZE

       To display all the properties of window # 0x200007: <u>xprop</u> -id 0x200007

       To set a simple string property: <u>xprop</u> -root -format MY_ATOM_NAME 8s -set MY_ATOM_NAME  "my_value"

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DISPLAY</b> To get default display.

       <b>XPROPFORMATS</b>
               Specifies the name of a file from which additional formats are to be obtained.
