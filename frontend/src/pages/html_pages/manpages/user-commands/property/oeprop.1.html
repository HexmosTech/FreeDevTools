</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       oeprop - One-Electron Property Program

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  program  <b>oeprop</b>  computes expectation values of one-electron property operators using a one-particle
       density matrix computed from an eigenvector in PSIF_CHKPT or read  in  from  an  external  file.   It  is
       currently  capable  of  performing  Mulliken  population  analysis,  computing electric multipole moments
       through octopole, electrostatic properties at atomic centers (electrostatic  potential,  electric  field,
       electric  field  gradient,  electron  and spin density, dipolar anisotropic contribution to the hyperfine
       coupling constants), electron and spin density, electron and spin density gradient, Laplacian of electron
       and spin densities, electrostatic potential over an arbitrary two-dimensional (planar) rectangular  grid,
       and  molecular  orbitals  values  over  an  arbitrary  three-dimensional rectangular grid.  Miscellaneous
       capabilities include computation of the relativistic first-order one-electron corrections to  the  energy
       (mass-velocity  and  Darwin  terms), construction of natural molecular orbitals from one-particle density
       read from an external file (NOs can be written to  PSIF_CHKPT)  and  computation  of  spatial  extents  -
       expectation  values of X^2, Y^2, Z^2, and R^2 operators - of total electron density and of individual MOs
       (if <b>READ_OPDM</b> <b>=</b> false) or natural (if <b>READ_OPDM</b> <b>=</b> true) orbitals (<b>MPMAX</b> must be set to  a  value  greater
       than 1 for computing these entities). Spatial extents should be used cautiously, since they depend on the
       reference point.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Most of the keywords are not necessary for routine tasks. The following keywords are valid:

       <b>WFN</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Type of the wavefunction. This keyword is a "macro" that allows user to set most of the  necessary
              keywords. The following values are recognized :

              <b>WFN</b> <b>=</b> SCF - equivalent to <b>READ_OPDM</b> <b>=</b> false;

              <b>WFN</b>  <b>=</b>  DETCI   -  equivalent  to <b>READ_OPDM</b> <b>=</b> true, <b>OPDM_FILE</b> <b>=</b> 40, <b>OPDM_BASIS</b> <b>=</b> AO, <b>OPDM_FORMAT</b> <b>=</b>
              TRIANG;

              <b>WFN</b> <b>=</b> CCSD - equivalent to <b>EAD_OPDM</b> <b>=</b> true, <b>OPDM_FILE</b> <b>=</b> 79, <b>OPDM_BASIS</b> <b>=</b> AO, <b>OPDM_FORMAT</b> <b>=</b> TRIANG;

              <b>WFN</b> <b>=</b> QVCCD - equivalent to <b>READ_OPDM</b> <b>=</b> true, <b>OPDM_FILE</b> <b>=</b>  76,  <b>OPDM_BASIS</b>  <b>=</b>  SO,  <b>OPDM_FORMAT</b>  <b>=</b>
              TRIANG;

       <b>READ_OPDM</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              This flag specifies if the one-particle density matrix to be read from disk.  Default is false.

       <b>OPDM_FILE</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              Specifies  one-particle  density  matrix  file  number.  Default  is 40 (master file).  To provide
              backward compatibility with the earlier PSI property packages  (<b>proper</b>,  <b>ciprop</b>,  <b>ccprop</b>)  special
              format  of the density file is assumed when <b>OPDM_FILE</b> <b>=</b> <b>40</b> (computing properties from CI density -
              <b>ciprop</b> compatibility mode) and <b>OPDM_FILE</b> <b>=</b> <b>79</b> (computing  properties  from  CC  density  -  <b>ccprop</b>
              compatibility  mode).   As of now, in generic case onepdm must be written in the very beginning of
              the file. In the future PSI will have a standard onepdm file.

       <b>OPDM_BASIS</b> <b>=</b> <u>string</u>
              This option may not exist in the future. As of February 1st, 1998, a standard for the onepdm  file
              format  has  not  been set. This keyword should be set to either "SO" (read in onepdm matrix in SO
              basis) or "AO" (in AO basis). Default is "SO".

       <b>OPDM_FORMAT</b> <b>=</b>  <u>string</u>
              This option may not exist in the future. This keyword should be set to either  "TRIANG"  (read  in
              onepdm matrix in lower triangular form) of "SQUARE" (in square form). Default is "TRIANG"

       <b>ASYMM_OPDM</b> <b>=</b>  <u>boolean</u>
              This  flag  specifies  whether  one-particle density matrix has to be symmetrized.  Must be set to
              true if generic non-symmetric onepdm to be read (for example,  from  a  coupled-cluster  program).
              This  keyword  is  for  code  development only. Existing PSI CC codes now in use produce symmetric
              onepdm, therefore there is no need to use this keyword.  Default is false.

       <b>ROOT</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              This specifies which root to do the excited state analysis  for.   The  appropriate  one  particle
              density matrix will be read from disk.  Currently implemented for DETCI and DETCAS wavefunctions.

       <b>MPMAX</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              This integer between 1 and 3 specifies the highest electric multipole moment to be computed.

              <b>MPMAX</b> <b>=</b> 1 - only electric dipole moment will be computed (default);

              <b>MPMAX</b>  <b>=</b> 2 - electric dipole and quadrupole moments will be computed; <b>MPMAX</b> <b>=</b> 3 - electric dipole,
              quadrupole, and octopole moments will be computed.

       <b>MP_REF</b> <u>integer</u>
              This parameter specifies the reference point for the electric multipole moments calculation.

              <b>MP_REF</b> <b>=</b> 0 (default) or 1 - the center of mass;

              <b>MP_REF</b> <b>=</b> 2 - the origin of the space coordinate system;

              <b>MP_REF</b> <b>=</b> 3 - the center of electronic charge;

              <b>MP_REF</b> <b>=</b> 4 - the center of nuclear charge;

              <b>MP_REF</b> <b>=</b> 5 - the center of net charge.

              <b>CAUTION</b> <b>:</b> According to classical electrodynamics, the electric 2^(n+1)-pole moment is  independent
              of  the  reference  point  only  if the electric 2^(n)-pole moment is vanishing. It means that the
              dipole moment will depend on the reference point if the total charge of the system is non-zero. By
              analogy, electric quadrupole moment will depend on the reference point  if  the  system  possesses
              non-zero electric dipole moment, etc.

       <b>MP_REF_XYZ</b> <b>=</b> <u>real_vector</u>
              This  vector  specifies  the coordinates of the reference point. If this keyword is present in the
              input <b>MP_REF</b> keyword will be disregarded.

       <b>NUC_ESP</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              This flag specifies if electrostatic properties will be  computed  at  the  nuclei.  Current  list
              includes  electrostatic  potential,  electric  field,  electric  field gradient, electron and spin
              density, and anisotropic constribution to the hyperfine coupling constants (the latter two require
              setting <b>SPIN_PROP</b> to true). Default is true.

       <b>GRID</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              Specifies type of property to be evaluated over a grid.

              <b>GRID</b> <b>=</b> 0 (default) - compute nothing;

              <b>GRID</b> <b>=</b> 1 - electrostatic potential on a two-dimensional grid;

              <b>GRID</b> <b>=</b> 2 - electron density (spin density if <b>SPIN_PROP</b> is set to true) on a two-dimensional grid;

              <b>GRID</b> <b>=</b> 3 - electron density gradient (spin density gradient if <b>SPIN_PROP</b> is set to true) on a two-
              dimensional grid;

              <b>GRID</b> <b>=</b> 4 - Laplacian of the electron density (Laplacian of the spin density if <b>SPIN_PROP</b> is set to
              true) on a two-dimensional grid. According to the convention used in the field, what actually gets
              plotted are the Laplacians taken with negative sign.

              <b>GRID</b> <b>=</b> 5 - values of molecular orbitals on a three-dimensional grid.

              <b>GRID</b> <b>=</b> 6 - values of the electron density (spin density gradient if <b>SPIN_PROP</b> is set to true) on a
              three-dimensional grid.

       <b>GRID_FORMAT</b> <b>=</b> <u>string</u>
              Specifies in which format the grid output will be produced.  Currently, <b>PLOTMTV</b> (default  for  2-d
              grids), <b>MEGAPOVPLUS</b> (available for 3-d grids), and <b>GAUSSCUBE</b>(default for 3-d grids) are supported.

       <b>MO_TO_PLOT</b> <b>=</b> <u>vector</u>
              Specifies  indices  of  the  molecular  orbitals  to  be  computed on the 3-d grid. Indices can be
              specified as:

              unsigned integer - index in Pitzer ordering (ordered accoring to irreps, not eigenvalues).  Ranges
              from 1 to the number of MOs.

              signed integer - index with respect to Fermi level. +1 means LUMO, +2 means second lowest  virtual
              orbital, -1 means HOMO, etc.

              All  indices  have  to  be  either  unsigned  or  signed, you can't mix and match, or you will get
              unpredictable results.  Default is to compute HOMO and LUMO.

       <b>GRID_ORIGIN</b> <b>=</b> <u>real_vector</u>
              Specifies the origin of the grid. A rectangular grid box which envelops the entire  molecule  will
              be computed automatically if <b>GRID_ORIGIN</b> is missing, however, there is no default for 2-d grids.

       <b>GRID_UNIT_X</b> <b>=</b> <u>real_vector</u>
              This vector specifies the direction of the first (x) side of the grid.  It doesn't have have to be
              of unit length.  There is no default for 2-d grids.

       <b>GRID_UNIT_Y</b> <b>=</b> <u>real_vector</u>
              The  same  for  the  second  (y)  side. It doesn't have to be of unit length or even orthogonal to
              <b>GRID_UNIT_X</b>.  There is no default for 2-d grids.

       <b>GRID_XY0</b> <b>=</b> <u>real_2d_vector</u>
              Specifies the coordinates of the lower left corner of the grid  rectangle  in  the  2D  coordinate
              system defined by GRID_ORIGIN, GRID_UNIT_X, and GRID_UNIT_Y.  There is no default.

       <b>GRID_XY1</b> <b>=</b> <u>real_2d_vector</u>
              Specifies  the  coordinates  of  the upper right corner of the grid rectangle in the 2D coordinate
              system defined by GRID_ORIGIN, GRID_UNIT_X, and GRID_UNIT_Y.  There is no default.

       <b>GRID_XYZ0</b> <b>=</b> <u>real_3d_vector</u>
              Specifies the coordinates of the far lower left corner of the grid box in the 3D coordinate system
              defined by GRID_ORIGIN, GRID_UNIT_X, GRID_UNIT_Y, and the cross-product of the latter  two.  There
              is no default.

       <b>GRID_XYZ1</b> <b>=</b> <u>real_3d_vector</u>
              Specifies  the  coordinates  of  the  near upper right corner of the grid box in the 3D coordinate
              system defined by GRID_ORIGIN, GRID_UNIT_X, GRID_UNIT_Y, and the cross-product of the latter  two.
              There is no default.

       <b>NIX</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              The  number  of  grid point along x direction. This parameter has to be greater than 1. Default is
              20.

       <b>NIY</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              The same as <b>NIX</b> for y direction. Default is 20.

       <b>NIZ</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              The same as <b>NIX</b> for z direction. Default is 20.

       <b>GRID_ZMIN</b> <b>=</b> <u>double</u>
              Lower limit on displayed z-values for contour plots of electron density and its Laplacian. Default
              is 0.0

              Controls logarithmic scaling of the produced electron density gradient plot. Turns the scaling off
              if set to zero, otherwise the higher value - the stronger  the  gradient  field  will  be  scaled.

       <b>SPIN_PROP</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Flag for computing spin properties (Mulliken population analysis of alpha and beta densities, spin
              densities  and  anisotropic  contributions to the hyperfine coupling constants at atomic centers).
              Default is false.

       <b>PRINT</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              This is the most important keyword - it determines amount of information  printed.  The  following
              values are currently used :

              <b>PRINT</b>  <b>=</b>  0  -  quiet  mode  -  print  out  essential results only - "compact" results of Mulliken
              population analysis, electric multipole moments, and electrostatic properties;

              (and SO) basis;

              <b>PRINT</b>  <b>=</b>  4  -  all of the above plus basis set information, natural orbitals in terms of symmetry
              orbitals, overlap matrix;

       <b>PRINT_NOS</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              If  WRTNOS  =  TRUE  and  this option is also TRUE, the natural orbitals will be printed to output
              before they are written to the checkpoint file.

       <b>WRTNOS</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              If TRUE, the natural orbitals will be written to the checkpoint file.
