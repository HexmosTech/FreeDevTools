</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mkvpropedit - Modify properties of existing Matroska files without a complete remux

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>mkvpropedit</b> [options] {source-filename} {actions}

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program analyses an existing Matroska file and modifies some of its properties. Then it writes those
       modifications to the existing file. Among the properties that can be changed are the segment information
       elements (e.g. the title) and the track headers (e.g. the language code, 'default track' flag or the
       name).

       Options:

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--list-property-names</b>
           Lists all known and editable property names, their type (string, integer, boolean etc) and a short
           description. The program exits afterwards. Therefore the <u>source-filename</u> parameter does not have to
           be supplied.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--parse-mode</b> <u>mode</u>
           Sets the parse mode. The parameter '<u>mode</u>' can either be 'fast' (which is also the default) or 'full'.
           The 'fast' mode does not parse the whole file but uses the meta seek elements for locating the
           required elements of a source file. In 99% of all cases this is enough. But for files that do not
           contain meta seek elements or which are damaged the user might have to set the 'full' parse mode. A
           full scan of a file can take a couple of minutes while a fast scan only takes seconds.

       Actions that deal with track and segment info properties:

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--edit</b> <u>selector</u>
           Sets the Matroska file section (segment information or a certain track's headers) that all following
           add, set and delete actions operate on. This option can be used multiple times in order to make
           modifications to more than one element.

           By default <b><a href="../man1/mkvpropedit.1.html">mkvpropedit</a></b>(1) will edit the segment information section.

           See the section about edit selectors for a full description of the syntax.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--add</b> <u>name</u>=<u>value</u>
           Adds a property <u>name</u> with the value <u>value</u>. The property will be added even if such a property exists
           already. Note that most properties are unique and cannot occur more than once.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--set</b> <u>name</u>=<u>value</u>
           Sets all occurrences of the property <u>name</u> to the value <u>value</u>. If no such property exists then it will
           be added.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--delete</b> <u>name</u>
           Deletes all occurrences of the property <u>name</u>. Note that some properties are required and cannot be
           deleted.

       Actions that deal with tags and chapters:

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--tags</b> <u>selector</u>:<u>filename</u>
           Add or replace tags in the file with the ones from filename or remove them if filename is empty.
           <b><a href="../man1/mkvpropedit.1.html">mkvpropedit</a></b>(1) reads the same XML tag format that <b><a href="../man1/mkvmerge.1.html">mkvmerge</a></b>(1) reads as well.

           The <u>selector</u> must be one of the words <b>all</b>, <b>global</b> or <b>track</b>. For <b>all</b> <b><a href="../man1/mkvpropedit.1.html">mkvpropedit</a></b>(1) will replace or
           remove all tags in a file. With <b>global</b> only global tags will be replaced or removed.

           With <b>track</b> <b><a href="../man1/mkvpropedit.1.html">mkvpropedit</a></b>(1) will replace tags for a specific track. Additionally the tags read from
           filename will be assigned to the same track. The track is specified in the same way edit selectors
           are specified (see below), e.g.  --tags track:a1:new-audio-tags.xml.

       <b>--add-track-statistics-tags</b>
           Calculates statistics for all tracks in a file and adds new statistics tags for them. If the file
           already contains such tags then they'll be updated.

       <b>--delete-track-statistics-tags</b>
           Deletes all existing track statistics tags from a file. If the file doesn't contain track statistics
           tags then it won't be modified.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--chapters</b> <u>filename</u>
           Add or replace chapters in the file with the ones from filename or remove them if filename is empty.
           <b><a href="../man1/mkvpropedit.1.html">mkvpropedit</a></b>(1) reads the same XML and simple chapter formats that <b><a href="../man1/mkvmerge.1.html">mkvmerge</a></b>(1) reads as well.

       Actions for handling attachments:

       <b>--add-attachment</b> <u>filename</u>
           Adds a new attachment from <u>filename</u>.

           If the option <b>--attachment-name</b> has been used prior to this option then its value is used as the new
           attachment's name. Otherwise it is derived from <u>filename</u>.

           If the option <b>--attachment-mime-type</b> has been used prior to this option then its value is used as the
           new attachment's MIME type. Otherwise it is auto-detected from the content of <u>filename</u>.

           If the option <b>--attachment-description</b> has been used prior to this option then its value is used as
           the new attachment's description. Otherwise no description will be set.

           If the option <b>--attachment-uid</b> has been used prior to this option then its value is used as the new
           attachment's UID. Otherwise a random UID will be generated automatically.

       <b>--replace-attachment</b> <u>selector</u>:<u>filename</u>
           Replaces one or more attachments that match <u>selector</u> with the file <u>filename</u>. If more than one
           existing attachment matches <u>selector</u> then all of their contents will be replaced by the content of
           <u>filename</u>.

           The <u>selector</u> can have one of four forms. They're explained below in the section attachment selectors.

           If the option <b>--attachment-name</b> has been used prior to this option then its value is set as the new
           name for each modified attachment. Otherwise the names aren't changed.

           If the option <b>--attachment-mime-type</b> has been used prior to this option then its value is set as the
           new MIME type for each modified attachment. Otherwise the MIME types aren't changed.

           If the option <b>--attachment-description</b> has been used prior to this option then its value is set as
           the new description for each modified attachment. Otherwise the descriptions aren't changed.

           If the option <b>--attachment-uid</b> has been used prior to this option then its value is set as the new
           UID for each modified attachment. Otherwise the UIDs aren't changed.

       <b>--update-attachment</b> <u>selector</u>
           Sets the properties of one or more attachments that match <u>selector</u>. If more than one existing
           attachment matches <u>selector</u> then all of their properties will be updated.

           The <u>selector</u> can have one of four forms. They're explained below in the section attachment selectors.

           If the option <b>--attachment-name</b> has been used prior to this option then its value is set as the new
           name for each modified attachment. Otherwise the names aren't changed.

           If the option <b>--attachment-mime-type</b> has been used prior to this option then its value is set as the
           new MIME type for each modified attachment. Otherwise the MIME types aren't changed.

           If the option <b>--attachment-description</b> has been used prior to this option then its value is set as
           the new description for each modified attachment. Otherwise the descriptions aren't changed.

           If the option <b>--attachment-uid</b> has been used prior to this option then its value is set as the new
           UID for each modified attachment. Otherwise the UIDs aren't changed.

       <b>--delete-attachment</b> <u>selector</u>
           Deletes one or more attachments that match <u>selector</u>.

           The <u>selector</u> can have one of four forms. They're explained below in the section attachment selectors.

       Options for attachment actions:

       <b>--attachment-name</b> <u>name</u>
           Sets the name to use for the following <b>--add-attachment</b> or <b>--replace-attachment</b> operation.

       <b>--attachment-mime-type</b> <u>mime-type</u>
           Sets the MIME type to use for the following <b>--add-attachment</b> or <b>--replace-attachment</b> operation.

       <b>--attachment-description</b> <u>description</u>
           Sets the description to use for the following <b>--add-attachment</b> or <b>--replace-attachment</b> operation.

       <b>--enable-legacy-font-mime-types</b>
           Enables the use of legacy MIME types for certain types of font attachments. For example,
           'application/x-truetype-font' will be used for TrueType fonts instead of 'fonts/ttf'.

           This affects both adding new attachments and replacing existing attachments, but only if the new MIME
           type isn't specified. Other existing attachments aren't changed.

           The affected MIME types are 'font/sfnt', 'font/ttf' and 'font/collection' which are all mapped to
           'application/x-truetype-fonts' and 'font/otf' which is mapped to 'application/vnd.ms-opentype'.

       Other options:

       <b>--disable-language-ietf</b>
           Normally when the user requests changes to the 'language' track header property, <b><a href="../man1/mkvpropedit.1.html">mkvpropedit</a></b>(1) will
           apply the same change to the new LanguageIETF track header element in addition to the legacy Language
           element. If this option is used, the change is only applied to the legacy Language element.

           This option does not affect changes requested via the 'language-ietf' track header property.

       <b>--normalize-language-ietf</b> <u>mode</u>
           Enables normalizing all IETF BCP 47 language tags to either their canonical form with mode
           'canonical', to their extended language subtags form with mode 'extlang' or turns it off with mode
           'off'. By default normalization to the canonical form is applied.

           In the canonical form all subtags for which preferred values exist are replaced by those preferred
           values. This converts e.g. 'zh-yue-jyutping' to 'yue-jyutping' or 'fr-FX' to 'fr-FR'.

           For the extended language subtags form the canonical form is built first. Afterwards all primary
           languages for which an extended language subtag exists are replaced by that extended language subtag
           and its prefix. This converts e.g. 'yue-jyutping' back to 'zh-yue-jyutping' but has no effect on
           'fr-FR' as 'fr' is not an extended language subtag.

           This normalization is only applied to elements that are actually changed:

           •   When editing track headers only those track language elements that are set via edit
               specifications are affected. Languages of tracks that aren't edited aren't changed. Editing a
               track but setting only properties other than the language won't affect the language either.

           •   When editing chapters all language elements of all chapter elements are affected as existing
               chapters are always fully replaced.

           •   When editing tags only the language elements of the tags that are actually replaced are affected.
               For example, when you replace global tags then existing track tags aren't affected.

           The best way to normalize all existing language tags in a file is to remux it with <b><a href="../man1/mkvmerge.1.html">mkvmerge</a></b>(1) and
           set its '--normalize-language-ietf' option to the desired mode.

       <b>--command-line-charset</b> <u>character-set</u>
           Sets the character set to convert strings given on the command line from. It defaults to the
           character set given by system's current locale.

       <b>--output-charset</b> <u>character-set</u>
           Sets the character set to which strings are converted that are to be output. It defaults to the
           character set given by system's current locale.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--redirect-output</b> <u>file-name</u>
           Writes all messages to the file <u>file-name</u> instead of to the console. While this can be done easily
           with output redirection there are cases in which this option is needed: when the terminal
           reinterprets the output before writing it to a file. The character set set with <b>--output-charset</b> is
           honored.

       <b>--ui-language</b> <u>code</u>
           Forces the translations for the language <u>code</u> to be used (e.g. 'de_DE' for the German translations).
           Entering 'list' as the <u>code</u> will cause the program to output a list of available translations.

       <b>--abort-on-warnings</b>
           Tells the program to abort after the first warning is emitted. The program's exit code will be 1.

       <b>--debug</b> <u>topic</u>
           Turn on debugging for a specific feature. This option is only useful for developers.

       <b>--engage</b> <u>feature</u>
           Turn on experimental features. A list of available features can be requested with <b>mkvpropedit</b>
           <b>--engage</b> <b>list</b>. These features are not meant to be used in normal situations.

       <b>--gui-mode</b>
           Turns on GUI mode. In this mode specially-formatted lines may be output that can tell a controlling
           GUI what's happening. These messages follow the format '#GUI#message'. The message may be followed by
           key/value pairs as in '#GUI#message#key1=value1#key2=value2...'. Neither the messages nor the keys
           are ever translated and always output in English.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Be verbose and show all the important Matroska elements as they're read.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show usage information and exit.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
           Show version information and exit.

       <b>@</b><u>options-file.json</u>
           Reads additional command line arguments from the file <u>options-file</u>. For a full explanation on the
           supported formats for such files see the section called "Option files" in the <b><a href="../man1/mkvmerge.1.html">mkvmerge</a></b>(1) man page.

</pre><h4><b>EDIT</b> <b>SELECTORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>--edit</b> option sets the Matroska file section (segment information or a certain track's headers) that
       all following add, set and delete actions operate on. This stays valid until the next <b>--edit</b> option is
       found. The argument to this option is called the edit selector.

       By default <b><a href="../man1/mkvpropedit.1.html">mkvpropedit</a></b>(1) will edit the segment information section.

   <b>Segment</b> <b>information</b>
       The segment information can be selected with one of these three words: 'info', 'segment_info' or
       'segmentinfo'. It contains properties like the segment title or the segment UID.

   <b>Track</b> <b>headers</b>
       Track headers can be selected with a slightly more complex selector. All variations start with 'track:'.
       The track header properties include elements like the language code, 'default track' flag or the track's
       name.

       <b>track:</b><u>n</u>
           If the parameter <u>n</u> is a number then the <u>n</u>th track will be selected. The track order is the same that
           <b><a href="../man1/mkvmerge.1.html">mkvmerge</a></b>(1)'s <b>--identify</b> option outputs.

           Numbering starts at 1.

       <b>track:</b><u>tn</u>
           If the parameter starts with a single character <u>t</u> followed by a <u>n</u> then the <u>n</u>th track of a specific
           track type will be selected. The track type parameter <u>t</u> must be one of these four characters: 'a' for
           an audio track, 'b' for a button track, 's' for a subtitle track and 'v' for a video track. The track
           order is the same that <b><a href="../man1/mkvmerge.1.html">mkvmerge</a></b>(1)'s <b>--identify</b> option outputs.

           Numbering starts at 1.

       <b>track:</b>=<u>uid</u>
           If the parameter starts with a '=' followed by a number <u>uid</u>, the track whose track UID element equals
           the given <u>uid</u> will be selected. Track UIDs can be obtained with <b><a href="../man1/mkvinfo.1.html">mkvinfo</a></b>(1).

       <b>track:</b>@<u>number</u>
           If the parameter starts with a '@' followed by a number <u>number</u>, the track whose track number element
           equals this <u>number</u> will be selected. Track numbers can be obtained with <b><a href="../man1/mkvinfo.1.html">mkvinfo</a></b>(1).

   <b>Notes</b>
       Due to the nature of the track edit selectors it is possible that several selectors actually match the
       same track headers. In such cases all actions for those edit selectors will be combined and executed in
       the order in which they're given on the command line.

</pre><h4><b>ATTACHMENT</b> <b>SELECTORS</b></h4><pre>
       An attachment selector is used with the two actions <b>--replace-attachment</b> and <b>--delete-attachment</b>. It can
       have one of the following four forms:

        1. Selection by attachment ID. In this form the selector is simply a number, the attachment's ID as
           output by <b><a href="../man1/mkvmerge.1.html">mkvmerge</a></b>(1)'s identification command.

        2. Selection by attachment UID (unique ID). In this form the selector is the equal sign = followed by a
           number, the attachment's unique ID as output by <b><a href="../man1/mkvmerge.1.html">mkvmerge</a></b>(1)'s verbose identification command.

        3. Selection by attachment name. In this form the selector is the literal word name: followed by the
           existing attachment's name. If this selector is used with <b>--replace-attachment</b> then colons within the
           name to match must be escaped as \c.

        4. Selection by MIME type. In this form the selector is the literal word mime-type: followed by the
           existing attachment's MIME type. If this selector is used with <b>--replace-attachment</b> then colons
           within the MIME type to match must be escaped as \c.

</pre><h4><b>LANGUAGE</b> <b>HANDLING</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="../man1/mkvpropedit.1.html">mkvpropedit</a></b>(1) mostly tries to do the right thing by default. Therefore changes to the <b>language</b> property
       will cause <b><a href="../man1/mkvpropedit.1.html">mkvpropedit</a></b>(1) to apply the same change to both the new "LanguageIETF" element as well as the
       old "Language" element similar to how <b><a href="../man1/mkvmerge.1.html">mkvmerge</a></b>(1) applies the language to both elements. For example,
       when using mkvpropedit movie.mkv --edit track:2 --set language=zh-TW the "LanguageIETF" element will be
       set to zh-TW and the old "Language" element to chi.

       Additionally there's a new track header property named <b>language-ietf</b> that can be set or removed. Changes
       to this property only apply to the new "LanguageIETF" track header element. A caveat is that the old
       "Language" track header element is a mandatory element in Matroska — meaning even if it isn't present in
       the file it still has an implied value. When the user only sets the <b>language-ietf</b> property but not the
       <b>language</b> property, <b><a href="../man1/mkvpropedit.1.html">mkvpropedit</a></b>(1) will therefore add the old "Language" element in certain cases &amp; set it
       to und (meaning "undetermined") as the user didn't specify a value for it.

       When reading XML chapter or tag files <b><a href="../man1/mkvpropedit.1.html">mkvpropedit</a></b>(1) works like <b><a href="../man1/mkvmerge.1.html">mkvmerge</a></b>(1) does.

       The creation of the new elements can be disabled completely with the command-line option
       `--disable-language-ietf` which operates on all three new elements.

       You can chose the normalization method applied to extended language sub-tags with the parameter
       <b>--normalize-language-ietf</b>.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following example edits a file called 'movie.mkv'. It sets the segment title and modifies the
       language code of an audio and a subtitle track. Note that this example can be shortened by leaving out
       the first <b>--edit</b> option because editing the segment information element is the default for all options
       found before the first <b>--edit</b> option anyway.

           $ mkvpropedit movie.mkv --edit info --set "title=The movie" --edit track:a1 --set language=fre --edit track:a2 --set language=ita

       The second example removes the 'default track flag' from the first subtitle track and sets it for the
       second one. Note that <b><a href="../man1/mkvpropedit.1.html">mkvpropedit</a></b>(1), unlike <b><a href="../man1/mkvmerge.1.html">mkvmerge</a></b>(1), does not set the 'default track flag' of other
       tracks to '0' if it is set to '1' for a different track automatically.

           $ mkvpropedit movie.mkv --edit track:s1 --set flag-default=0 --edit track:s2 --set flag-default=1

       Replacing the tags for the second subtitle track in a file looks like this:

           $ mkvpropedit movie.mkv --tags track:s2:new-subtitle-tags.xml

       Removing all tags requires leaving out the file name:

           $ mkvpropedit movie.mkv --tags all:

       Replacing the chapters in a file looks like this:

           $ mkvpropedit movie.mkv --chapters new-chapters.xml

       Removing all chapters requires leaving out the file name:

           $ mkvpropedit movie.mkv --chapters ''

       Adding a font file (Arial.ttf) as an attachment:

           $ mkvpropedit movie.mkv --add-attachment Arial.ttf

       Adding a font file (89719823.ttf) as an attachment and providing some information as it really is just
       Arial:

           $ mkvpropedit movie.mkv --attachment-name Arial.ttf --attachment-description 'The Arial font as a TrueType font' --attachment-mime-type application/x-truetype-font --add-attachment 89719823.ttf

       Replacing one attached font (Comic.ttf) file with another one (Arial.ttf):

           $ mkvpropedit movie.mkv --attachment-name Arial.ttf --attachment-description 'The Arial font as a TrueType font' --replace-attachment name:Comic.ttf:Arial.ttf

       Deleting the second attached file, whatever it may be:

           $ mkvpropedit movie.mkv --delete-attachment 2

       Deleting all attached fonts by MIME type:

           $ mkvpropedit movie.mkv --delete-attachment mime-type:application/x-truetype-font

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="../man1/mkvpropedit.1.html">mkvpropedit</a></b>(1) exits with one of three exit codes:

       •   <b>0</b> -- This exit code means that the modification has completed successfully.

       •   <b>1</b> -- In this case <b><a href="../man1/mkvpropedit.1.html">mkvpropedit</a></b>(1) has output at least one warning, but the modification did continue.
           A warning is prefixed with the text 'Warning:'. Depending on the issues involved the resulting files
           might be ok or not. The user is urged to check both the warning and the resulting files.

       •   <b>2</b> -- This exit code is used after an error occurred.  <b><a href="../man1/mkvpropedit.1.html">mkvpropedit</a></b>(1) aborts right after outputting
           the error message. Error messages range from wrong command line arguments over read/write errors to
           broken files.

</pre><h4><b>TEXT</b> <b>FILES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>CHARACTER</b> <b>SET</b> <b>CONVERSIONS</b></h4><pre>

       input/output encoding, command line encoding and console encoding please see the identically-named
       section in the <b><a href="../man1/mkvmerge.1.html">mkvmerge</a></b>(1) man page.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="../man1/mkvpropedit.1.html">mkvpropedit</a></b>(1) uses the default variables that determine the system's locale (e.g.  <u>LANG</u> and the <u>LC_*</u>
       family). Additional variables:

       <u>MKVPROPEDIT_DEBUG</u>, <u>MKVTOOLNIX_DEBUG</u> and its short form <u>MTX_DEBUG</u>
           The content is treated as if it had been passed via the <b>--debug</b> option.

       <u>MKVPROPEDIT_ENGAGE</u>, <u>MKVTOOLNIX_ENGAGE</u> and its short form <u>MTX_ENGAGE</u>
           The content is treated as if it had been passed via the <b>--engage</b> option.
