       plcget - Qualcomm Atheros PLC Get Propery

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>plcget</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>device</u>] [<u>device</u>] [...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Read  a  specific  property  value  from  a  Qualcomm  Atheros powerline device using the VS_GET_PROPERTY
       message.  Properties are selected using their  numeric  property  identifier.   Property  names  are  not
       supported.   Property  values  are printed on stdout in hexadecimal format by default.  Alternate formats
       are ASCII, binary and decimal.

       Only selected properties can be read  using  this  message  type.   See  the  Qualcomm  Atheros  <u>Firmware</u>
       <u>Technical</u> <u>Reference</u> <u>Manual</u> for supported properties and versions.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the <b>plc</b> man page for an overview and
       installation instructions.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -<b>a</b>     Display  output  in  string  format  where  each  byte  appears  as an ASCII character.  Non-ASCII
              characters are displayed as a period or full-stop.  This option  is  useful  for  displaying  HFID
              property values.

       -<b>b</b>     Display  output  in binary format where each byte appears as 8 bits or binary digits.  This option
              is useful for interpreting bit-mapped property values.

       -<b>d</b>     Display output in decimal format where each byte appears as three decimal digits.  This option  is
              useful for properties with small integer values.

       -<b>e</b>     Redirects  stderr  messages  to  stdout.   By  convention status and error messages are printed on
              stderr while primary program output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout
              in cases where this is desired.

       -<b>h</b>     Display output in hexadecimal format where each byte appears as a hexadecimal octet consisting  of
              two hexadecimal digits.  Hexadecimal is the default output format.

       -<b>n</b> <u>number</u>
              The  property  identifier  or  property version.  Property identifiers and versions are entered as
              32-bit decimal integers.  Property names are not supported.  The default is <b>0</b>.   This  option  may
              appear more than once on the command line.  The first occurance specifies the property identifier.
              The second occurances specifies the property version.  See the <u>Firmware</u> <u>Technical</u> <u>Reference</u> <u>Manual</u>
              for an list of valid property identifiers and versions.

       -<b>i</b> <u>interface</u>
              Select  the  host  Ethernet interface.  All requests are sent via this interface and only reponses
              received via this interface are recognized.  The default interface is <b>eth1</b> because most people use
              <b>eth0</b> as their principle network connection; however, if environment string "PLC" is  defined  then
              it  takes  precedence  over  the default interface.  This option then takes precedence over either
              default.

       -<b>q</b>     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -<b>v</b>     Prints additional information on stdout.  In  particular,  this  option  dumps  outgoing  Ethernet
              packets on stdout.

       -<b>?</b>,--<b>help</b>
              Displays  program help information on stderr.  This option takes precedence over all other options
              on the command line except version information.

       -<b>!</b>,--<b>version</b>
              Displays program version information on stderr.  This  option  takes  precedence  over  all  other
              options on the command line except help information.  Use this option when sending screen dumps to
              Atheros technical staff.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>device</u> The  MAC  address of some powerline device.  More than one address may be specified.  If more than
              one address is specified then operations are performed  on  each  device  in  turn.   The  default
              address is <b>local</b>.  See <b>DEVICES</b> for information about symbolic device addresses.

</pre><h4><b>DEVICES</b></h4><pre>
       Powerline  devices  use  Ethernet  Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.  A MAC address is a 48-bit value
       entered as 12 hexadecimal digits in upper, lower or mixed character case.  Octets may be  separated  with
       colons  for  clarity.  For example, "00b052000001", "00:b0:52:00:00:01" and "00b052:000001" are valid and
       equivalent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.

       <b>all</b>    Same as "broadcast".

       <b>broadcast</b>
              A synonym for the Ethernet broadcast address,  <b>FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF</b>.   All  devices,  whether  local,
              remote  or  foreign recognize messages sent to this address.  A remote device is any device at the
              far end of a powerline connection.  A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

       <b>local</b>  A  synonym  for  the  Qualcomm  Atheros  vendor   specific   Local   Management   Address   (LMA),
              <b>00:B0:52:00:00:01</b>.   All  local  Atheros  devices  recognize  this  address but remote and foreign
              devices do not.  A remote device is any device at the  far  end  of  a  powerline  connection.   A
              foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.
