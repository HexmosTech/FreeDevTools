</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ssdeep - Computes context triggered piecewise hashes (fuzzy hashes)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ssdeep</b> <b>[-m</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;]</b> <b>[-k</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;]</b> <b>[-vdprgsblcxa]</b> <b>[-t</b> <b>val]</b> <b>[FILES]</b>
       <b>ssdeep</b> <b>[-V|h]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Computes a signature based on context triggered piecewise hashes for each input file, also called a fuzzy
       hash.   If requested, the program matches those signatures against a file of known signatures and reports
       any possible matches.  It can also examine one or more files of signatures and find any matches in  those
       files.  Output is written to standard out and errors to standard error.

       <b>-m</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Loads  the  specified  file  of known hashes to be used for matching. This file must be a previous
              output of the program. The program then hashes each entry in FILES and compares  these  signatures
              to  the  known  signatures.  Any matches which score above the threshold are displayed.  This flag
              may be used multiple times to load more known signatures.  This flag may not be used with  the  -k
              or -x flags.

       <b>-k</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Load  the  specified  file  of  known hashes to be used for matching. This file must be a previous
              output of the program. The program then treats each entry in FILES as a set  of  known  hashes  as
              well.  The  hashes  in  these FILES are compared to the known hashes from this file. Matches which
              score above the threshold are displayed. Both the file specified here and the input  FILES  should
              contain  fuzzy  hashes.  This flag may be used multiple times to load more known signatures.  This
              flag may not be used with the -m, -d, or -p flags.

       <b>-v</b>     Verbose mode. The name of each file is printed to standard error as it is being hashed.

       <b>-d</b>     Computes a signature for each entry in the FILES and compares it to the set of  known  signatures.
              Matches which score above the threshold are displayed. The computed signature is then added to the
              set of known signatures.  This flag may not be used with the -k or -x flags.

       <b>-p</b>     Works  like  the  -d  flag, but displays all matches for each file. That is, for two files A and B
              which match score above the threshold, displays "A matches B" and "B matches A".   This  flag  may
              not be used with the -k or -x flags.

       <b>-r</b>     Enables  recursive mode. All subdirectories are traversed.  Please note that recursive mode cannot
              be used to examine all files of a given file extension. For example, invoking the program with  <b>-r</b>
              <b>*.txt</b> will examine all files in directories that end in .txt.  If you want to process all files in
              a directory tree with the .txt suffix, try using the <b><a href="../man1/find.1.html">find</a>(1)</b> command.

       <b>-g</b>     Similar  files  are  grouped  together  into  clusters. This can be handy for finding more similar
              files. That is, if you are searching for file A, which matches B, anything which  matches  B  will
              also be included in the cluster.

       <b>-s</b>     Silent mode. All error messages are suppressed.

       <b>-b</b>     Enables  bare  mode. Strips any leading directory information from displayed filenames.  This flag
              may not be used in conjunction with the <b>-l</b> flag.

       <b>-l</b>     Enables relative file paths. Instead of printing the absolute path for  each  file,  displays  the
              relative file path as indicated on the command line. This flag may not be used in conjunction with
              the <b>-b</b> flag.

       <b>-c</b>     Enables  comma  separated  output  mode.  In any of the matching modes -d, -p, or -m, displays the
              results as input file, known file, matching score.

       <b>-x</b>     Signature file matching.  Each entry in FILES must contain  signatures  generated  by  a  previous
              output  of  the  program.  Each  signature is loaded and compared against the set of known hashes.
              Match scores above the threshold are displayed. Each signature is then added to the set of knowns.
              This flag may not be used with the -m, -d, or -p flags.

       <b>-a</b>     Displays all matches in any of the matching mode, regardless of score.  Using the -a flag displays
              all results, even if the match score is zero.

       <b>-t</b> <b>&lt;val&gt;</b>
              In any of the matching modes, only display matches when match score  is  greater  than  the  given
              value. The default threshold value is zero.

       <b>-h</b>     Show a help screen and exit.

       <b>-V</b>     Show the version number and exit.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Returns  0  on  success,  1  if  there  is  a  problem.  Read errors, permission denied, and encountering
       directories while not in recursive mode are still considered successes. Problems are  things  like  being
       unable to load the matching file, specifying both bare and relative paths, etc.
