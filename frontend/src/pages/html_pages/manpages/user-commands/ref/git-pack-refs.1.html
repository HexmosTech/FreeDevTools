</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       git-pack-refs - Pack heads and tags for efficient repository access

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>git</u> <u>pack-refs</u> [--all] [--no-prune] [--auto] [--include &lt;pattern&gt;] [--exclude &lt;pattern&gt;]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Traditionally, tips of branches and tags (collectively known as <u>refs</u>) were stored one file per ref in a
       (sub)directory under <b>$GIT_DIR/refs</b> directory. While many branch tips tend to be updated often, most tags
       and some branch tips are never updated. When a repository has hundreds or thousands of tags, this
       one-file-per-ref format both wastes storage and hurts performance.

       This command is used to solve the storage and performance problem by storing the refs in a single file,
       <b>$GIT_DIR/packed-refs</b>. When a ref is missing from the traditional <b>$GIT_DIR/refs</b> directory hierarchy, it is
       looked up in this file and used if found.

       Subsequent updates to branches always create new files under <b>$GIT_DIR/refs</b> directory hierarchy.

       A recommended practice to deal with a repository with too many refs is to pack its refs with <b>--all</b> once,
       and occasionally run <b>git</b> <b>pack-refs</b>. Tags are by definition stationary and are not expected to change.
       Branch heads will be packed with the initial <b>pack-refs</b> <b>--all</b>, but only the currently active branch heads
       will become unpacked, and the next <b>pack-refs</b> (without <b>--all</b>) will leave them unpacked.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --all
           The command by default packs all tags and refs that are already packed, and leaves other refs alone.
           This is because branches are expected to be actively developed and packing their tips does not help
           performance. This option causes all refs to be packed as well, with the exception of hidden refs,
           broken refs, and symbolic refs. Useful for a repository with many branches of historical interests.

       --no-prune
           The command usually removes loose refs under <b>$GIT_DIR/refs</b> hierarchy after packing them. This option
           tells it not to.

       --auto
           Pack refs as needed depending on the current state of the ref database. The behavior depends on the
           ref format used by the repository and may change in the future.

           •   "files": No special handling for <b>--auto</b> has been implemented.

           •   "reftable": Tables are compacted such that they form a geometric sequence. For two tables N and
               N+1, where N+1 is newer, this maintains the property that N is at least twice as big as N+1. Only
               tables that violate this property are compacted.

       --include &lt;pattern&gt;
           Pack refs based on a <b>glob</b>(<b>7</b>) pattern. Repetitions of this option accumulate inclusion patterns. If a
           ref is both included in <b>--include</b> and <b>--exclude</b>, <b>--exclude</b> takes precedence. Using <b>--include</b> will
           preclude all tags from being included by default. Symbolic refs and broken refs will never be packed.
           When used with <b>--all</b>, it will be a noop. Use <b>--no-include</b> to clear and reset the list of patterns.

       --exclude &lt;pattern&gt;
           Do not pack refs matching the given <b>glob</b>(<b>7</b>) pattern. Repetitions of this option accumulate exclusion
           patterns. Use <b>--no-exclude</b> to clear and reset the list of patterns. If a ref is already packed,
           including it with <b>--exclude</b> will not unpack it.

       When used with <b>--all</b>, pack only loose refs which do not match any of the provided <b>--exclude</b> patterns.

       When used with <b>--include</b>, refs provided to <b>--include</b>, minus refs that are provided to <b>--exclude</b> will be
       packed.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Older documentation written before the packed-refs mechanism was introduced may still say things like
       ".git/refs/heads/&lt;branch&gt; file exists" when it means "branch &lt;branch&gt; exists".
