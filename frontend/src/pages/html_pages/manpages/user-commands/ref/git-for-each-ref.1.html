       git-for-each-ref - Output information on each ref

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>git</u> <u>for-each-ref</u> [--count=&lt;count&gt;] [--shell|--perl|--python|--tcl]
                          [(--sort=&lt;key&gt;)...] [--format=&lt;format&gt;]
                          [--include-root-refs] [ --stdin | &lt;pattern&gt;... ]
                          [--points-at=&lt;object&gt;]
                          [--merged[=&lt;object&gt;]] [--no-merged[=&lt;object&gt;]]
                          [--contains[=&lt;object&gt;]] [--no-contains[=&lt;object&gt;]]
                          [--exclude=&lt;pattern&gt; ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Iterate over all refs that match <u>&lt;pattern&gt;</u> and show them according to the given <u>&lt;format&gt;</u>, after sorting
       them according to the given set of <u>&lt;key&gt;</u>. If <u>&lt;count&gt;</u> is given, stop after showing that many refs. The
       interpolated values in <u>&lt;format&gt;</u> can optionally be quoted as string literals in the specified host
       language allowing their direct evaluation in that language.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       &lt;pattern&gt;...
           If one or more patterns are given, only refs are shown that match against at least one pattern,
           either using <a href="../man3/fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch</a>(3) or literally, in the latter case matching completely or from the beginning up
           to a slash.

       --stdin
           If <b>--stdin</b> is supplied, then the list of patterns is read from standard input instead of from the
           argument list.

       --count=&lt;count&gt;
           By default the command shows all refs that match <u>&lt;pattern&gt;</u>. This option makes it stop after showing
           that many refs.

       --sort=&lt;key&gt;
           A field name to sort on. Prefix <b>-</b> to sort in descending order of the value. When unspecified, <b>refname</b>
           is used. You may use the --sort=&lt;key&gt; option multiple times, in which case the last key becomes the
           primary key.

       --format=&lt;format&gt;
           A string that interpolates %(<b>fieldname</b>) from a ref being shown and the object it points at. In
           addition, the string literal %% renders as % and %xx - where <b>xx</b> are hex digits - renders as the
           character with hex code <b>xx</b>. For example, %00 interpolates to \0 (NUL), %09 to \t (TAB), and %0a to \n
           (LF).

           When unspecified, <u>&lt;format&gt;</u> defaults to %(<b>objectname</b>) <b>SPC</b> %(<b>objecttype</b>) <b>TAB</b> %(<b>refname</b>).

       --color[=&lt;when&gt;]
           Respect any colors specified in the <b>--format</b> option. The <u>&lt;when&gt;</u> field must be one of <b>always</b>, <b>never</b>,
           or <b>auto</b> (if <u>&lt;when&gt;</u> is absent, behave as if <b>always</b> was given).

       --shell, --perl, --python, --tcl
           If given, strings that substitute %(<b>fieldname</b>) placeholders are quoted as string literals suitable
           for the specified host language. This is meant to produce a scriptlet that can directly be `eval`ed.

       --points-at=&lt;object&gt;
           Only list refs which points at the given object.

       --merged[=&lt;object&gt;]
           Only list refs whose tips are reachable from the specified commit (HEAD if not specified).

       --no-merged[=&lt;object&gt;]
           Only list refs whose tips are not reachable from the specified commit (HEAD if not specified).

       --contains[=&lt;object&gt;]
           Only list refs which contain the specified commit (HEAD if not specified).

       --no-contains[=&lt;object&gt;]
           Only list refs which don’t contain the specified commit (HEAD if not specified).

       --ignore-case
           Sorting and filtering refs are case insensitive.

       --omit-empty
           Do not print a newline after formatted refs where the format expands to the empty string.

       --exclude=&lt;pattern&gt;
           If one or more patterns are given, only refs which do not match any excluded pattern(s) are shown.
           Matching is done using the same rules as <u>&lt;pattern&gt;</u> above.

       --include-root-refs
           List root refs (HEAD and pseudorefs) apart from regular refs.

</pre><h4><b>FIELD</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       Various values from structured fields in referenced objects can be used to interpolate into the resulting
       output, or as sort keys.

       For all objects, the following names can be used:

       refname
           The name of the ref (the part after $GIT_DIR/). For a non-ambiguous short name of the ref append
           <b>:short</b>. The option core.warnAmbiguousRefs is used to select the strict abbreviation mode. If
           <b>lstrip=</b><u>&lt;N&gt;</u> (<b>rstrip=</b><u>&lt;N&gt;</u>) is appended, strips <u>&lt;N&gt;</u> slash-separated path components from the front (back)
           of the refname (e.g. %(<b>refname:lstrip=2</b>) turns <b>refs/tags/foo</b> into <b>foo</b> and %(<b>refname:rstrip=2</b>) turns
           <b>refs/tags/foo</b> into <b>refs</b>). If <u>&lt;N&gt;</u> is a negative number, strip as many path components as necessary
           from the specified end to leave <b>-</b><u>&lt;N&gt;</u> path components (e.g. %(<b>refname:lstrip=-2</b>) turns <b>refs/tags/foo</b>
           into <b>tags/foo</b> and %(<b>refname:rstrip=-1</b>) turns <b>refs/tags/foo</b> into <b>refs</b>). When the ref does not have
           enough components, the result becomes an empty string if stripping with positive &lt;N&gt;, or it becomes
           the full refname if stripping with negative &lt;N&gt;. Neither is an error.

           <b>strip</b> can be used as a synonym to <b>lstrip</b>.

       objecttype
           The type of the object (<b>blob</b>, <b>tree</b>, <b>commit</b>, <b>tag</b>).

       objectsize
           The size of the object (the same as <u>git</u> <u>cat-file</u> <u>-s</u> reports). Append <b>:disk</b> to get the size, in bytes,
           that the object takes up on disk. See the note about on-disk sizes in the <b>CAVEATS</b> section below.

       objectname
           The object name (aka SHA-1). For a non-ambiguous abbreviation of the object name append <b>:short</b>. For
           an abbreviation of the object name with desired length append <b>:short=</b><u>&lt;length&gt;</u>, where the minimum
           length is MINIMUM_ABBREV. The length may be exceeded to ensure unique object names.

       deltabase
           This expands to the object name of the delta base for the given object, if it is stored as a delta.
           Otherwise it expands to the null object name (all zeroes).

       upstream
           The name of a local ref which can be considered “upstream” from the displayed ref. Respects <b>:short</b>,
           <b>:lstrip</b> and <b>:rstrip</b> in the same way as <b>refname</b> above. Additionally respects <b>:track</b> to show "[ahead N,
           behind M]" and <b>:trackshort</b> to show the terse version: "&gt;" (ahead), "&lt;" (behind), "&lt;&gt;" (ahead and
           behind), or "=" (in sync).  <b>:track</b> also prints "[gone]" whenever unknown upstream ref is encountered.
           Append <b>:track,nobracket</b> to show tracking information without brackets (i.e "ahead N, behind M").

           For any remote-tracking branch %(<b>upstream</b>), %(<b>upstream:remotename</b>) and %(<b>upstream:remoteref</b>) refer to
           the name of the remote and the name of the tracked remote ref, respectively. In other words, the
           remote-tracking branch can be updated explicitly and individually by using the refspec
           %(<b>upstream:remoteref</b>)<b>:</b>%(<b>upstream</b>) to fetch from %(<b>upstream:remotename</b>).

           Has no effect if the ref does not have tracking information associated with it. All the options apart
           from <b>nobracket</b> are mutually exclusive, but if used together the last option is selected.

       push
           The name of a local ref which represents the <b>@</b>{push} location for the displayed ref. Respects <b>:short</b>,
           <b>:lstrip</b>, <b>:rstrip</b>, <b>:track</b>, <b>:trackshort</b>, <b>:remotename</b>, and <b>:remoteref</b> options as <b>upstream</b> does. Produces
           an empty string if no <b>@</b>{push} ref is configured.

       HEAD
           <u>*</u> if HEAD matches current ref (the checked out branch), ' ' otherwise.

       color
           Change output color. Followed by <b>:</b><u>&lt;colorname&gt;</u>, where color names are described under Values in the
           "CONFIGURATION FILE" section of <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1). For example, %(<b>color:bold</b> <b>red</b>).

       align
           Left-, middle-, or right-align the content between %(align:...) and %(end). The "align:" is followed
           by <b>width=</b><u>&lt;width&gt;</u> and <b>position=</b><u>&lt;position&gt;</u> in any order separated by a comma, where the <u>&lt;position&gt;</u> is
           either left, right or middle, default being left and <u>&lt;width&gt;</u> is the total length of the content with
           alignment. For brevity, the "width=" and/or "position=" prefixes may be omitted, and bare &lt;width&gt; and
           &lt;position&gt; used instead. For instance, %(<b>align:</b><u>&lt;width&gt;</u><b>,</b><u>&lt;position&gt;</u>). If the contents length is more
           than the width then no alignment is performed. If used with <b>--quote</b> everything in between
           %(align:...) and %(end) is quoted, but if nested then only the topmost level performs quoting.

       if
           Used as %(if)...%(then)...%(end) or %(if)...%(then)...%(else)...%(end). If there is an atom with
           value or string literal after the %(if) then everything after the %(then) is printed, else if the
           %(else) atom is used, then everything after %(else) is printed. We ignore space when evaluating the
           string before %(then), this is useful when we use the %(HEAD) atom which prints either "*" or " " and
           we want to apply the <u>if</u> condition only on the <u>HEAD</u> ref. Append ":equals=&lt;string&gt;" or
           ":notequals=&lt;string&gt;" to compare the value between the %(if:...) and %(then) atoms with the given
           string.

       symref
           The ref which the given symbolic ref refers to. If not a symbolic ref, nothing is printed. Respects
           the <b>:short</b>, <b>:lstrip</b> and <b>:rstrip</b> options in the same way as <b>refname</b> above.

       signature
           The GPG signature of a commit.

       signature:grade
           Show "G" for a good (valid) signature, "B" for a bad signature, "U" for a good signature with unknown
           validity, "X" for a good signature that has expired, "Y" for a good signature made by an expired key,
           "R" for a good signature made by a revoked key, "E" if the signature cannot be checked (e.g. missing
           key) and "N" for no signature.

       signature:signer
           The signer of the GPG signature of a commit.

       signature:key
           The key of the GPG signature of a commit.

       signature:fingerprint
           The fingerprint of the GPG signature of a commit.

       signature:primarykeyfingerprint
           The primary key fingerprint of the GPG signature of a commit.

       signature:trustlevel
           The trust level of the GPG signature of a commit. Possible outputs are <b>ultimate</b>, <b>fully</b>, <b>marginal</b>,
           <b>never</b> and <b>undefined</b>.

       worktreepath
           The absolute path to the worktree in which the ref is checked out, if it is checked out in any linked
           worktree. Empty string otherwise.

       ahead-behind:&lt;committish&gt;
           Two integers, separated by a space, demonstrating the number of commits ahead and behind,
           respectively, when comparing the output ref to the <u>&lt;committish&gt;</u> specified in the format.

       is-base:&lt;committish&gt;
           In at most one row, (<u>&lt;committish&gt;</u>) will appear to indicate the ref that is most likely the ref used
           as a starting point for the branch that produced <u>&lt;committish&gt;</u>. This choice is made using a heuristic:
           choose the ref that minimizes the number of commits in the first-parent history of <u>&lt;committish&gt;</u> and
           not in the first-parent history of the ref.

           For example, consider the following figure of first-parent histories of several refs:

               *--*--*--*--*--* refs/heads/A
               \
                \
                 *--*--*--* refs/heads/B
                  \     \
                   \     \
                    *     * refs/heads/C
                     \
                      \
                       *--* refs/heads/D

           Here, if <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>C</b> are the filtered references, and the format string is %(<b>refname</b>)<b>:</b>%(<b>is-base:D</b>),
           then the output would be

               refs/heads/A:
               refs/heads/B:(D)
               refs/heads/C:

           This is because the first-parent history of <b>D</b> has its earliest intersection with the first-parent
           histories of the filtered refs at a common first-parent ancestor of <b>B</b> and <b>C</b> and ties are broken by
           the earliest ref in the sorted order.

           Note that this token will not appear if the first-parent history of <u>&lt;committish&gt;</u> does not intersect
           the first-parent histories of the filtered refs.

       describe[:options]
           A human-readable name, like <b><a href="../man1/git-describe.1.html">git-describe</a></b>(1); empty string for undescribable commits. The <b>describe</b>
           string may be followed by a colon and one or more comma-separated options.

           tags=&lt;bool-value&gt;
               Instead of only considering annotated tags, consider lightweight tags as well; see the
               corresponding option in <b><a href="../man1/git-describe.1.html">git-describe</a></b>(1) for details.

           abbrev=&lt;number&gt;
               Use at least &lt;number&gt; hexadecimal digits; see the corresponding option in <b><a href="../man1/git-describe.1.html">git-describe</a></b>(1) for
               details.

           match=&lt;pattern&gt;
               Only consider tags matching the given <b>glob</b>(<b>7</b>) pattern, excluding the "refs/tags/" prefix; see the
               corresponding option in <b><a href="../man1/git-describe.1.html">git-describe</a></b>(1) for details.

           exclude=&lt;pattern&gt;
               Do not consider tags matching the given <b>glob</b>(<b>7</b>) pattern, excluding the "refs/tags/" prefix; see
               the corresponding option in <b><a href="../man1/git-describe.1.html">git-describe</a></b>(1) for details.

       In addition to the above, for commit and tag objects, the header field names (<b>tree</b>, <b>parent</b>, <b>object</b>, <b>type</b>,
       and <b>tag</b>) can be used to specify the value in the header field. Fields <b>tree</b> and <b>parent</b> can also be used
       with modifier <b>:short</b> and <b>:short=</b><u>&lt;length&gt;</u> just like <b>objectname</b>.

       For commit and tag objects, the special <b>creatordate</b> and <b>creator</b> fields will correspond to the appropriate
       date or name-email-date tuple from the <b>committer</b> or <b>tagger</b> fields depending on the object type. These are
       intended for working on a mix of annotated and lightweight tags.

       For tag objects, a <b>fieldname</b> prefixed with an asterisk (*) expands to the <b>fieldname</b> value of the peeled
       object, rather than that of the tag object itself.

       Fields that have name-email-date tuple as its value (<b>author</b>, <b>committer</b>, and <b>tagger</b>) can be suffixed with
       <b>name</b>, <b>email</b>, and <b>date</b> to extract the named component. For email fields (<b>authoremail</b>, <b>committeremail</b> and
       <b>taggeremail</b>), <b>:trim</b> can be appended to get the email without angle brackets, and <b>:localpart</b> to get the
       part before the <b>@</b> symbol out of the trimmed email. In addition to these, the <b>:mailmap</b> option and the
       corresponding <b>:mailmap,trim</b> and <b>:mailmap,localpart</b> can be used (order does not matter) to get values of
       the name and email according to the .mailmap file or according to the file set in the mailmap.file or
       mailmap.blob configuration variable (see <b><a href="../man5/gitmailmap.5.html">gitmailmap</a></b>(5)).

       The raw data in an object is <b>raw</b>.

       raw:size
           The raw data size of the object.

       Note that <b>--format=</b>%(<b>raw</b>) can not be used with <b>--python</b>, <b>--shell</b>, <b>--tcl</b>, because such language may not
       support arbitrary binary data in their string variable type.

       The message in a commit or a tag object is <b>contents</b>, from which <b>contents:</b><u>&lt;part&gt;</u> can be used to extract
       various parts out of:

       contents:size
           The size in bytes of the commit or tag message.

       contents:subject
           The first paragraph of the message, which typically is a single line, is taken as the "subject" of
           the commit or the tag message. Instead of <b>contents:subject</b>, field <b>subject</b> can also be used to obtain
           same results.  <b>:sanitize</b> can be appended to <b>subject</b> for subject line suitable for filename.

       contents:body
           The remainder of the commit or the tag message that follows the "subject".

       contents:signature
           The optional GPG signature of the tag.

       contents:lines=N
           The first <b>N</b> lines of the message.

       Additionally, the trailers as interpreted by <b><a href="../man1/git-interpret-trailers.1.html">git-interpret-trailers</a></b>(1) are obtained as <b>trailers</b>[<b>:options</b>]
       (or by using the historical alias <b>contents:trailers</b>[<b>:options</b>]). For valid [:option] values see <b>trailers</b>
       section of <b><a href="../man1/git-log.1.html">git-log</a></b>(1).

       For sorting purposes, fields with numeric values sort in numeric order (<b>objectsize</b>, <b>authordate</b>,
       <b>committerdate</b>, <b>creatordate</b>, <b>taggerdate</b>). All other fields are used to sort in their byte-value order.

       There is also an option to sort by versions, this can be done by using the fieldname <b>version:refname</b> or
       its alias <b>v:refname</b>.

       In any case, a field name that refers to a field inapplicable to the object referred by the ref does not
       cause an error. It returns an empty string instead.

       As a special case for the date-type fields, you may specify a format for the date by adding <b>:</b> followed by
       date format name (see the values the <b>--date</b> option to <b><a href="../man1/git-rev-list.1.html">git-rev-list</a></b>(1) takes). If this formatting is
       provided in a <b>--sort</b> key, references will be sorted according to the byte-value of the formatted string
       rather than the numeric value of the underlying timestamp.

       Some atoms like %(align) and %(if) always require a matching %(end). We call them "opening atoms" and
       sometimes denote them as %($open).

       When a scripting language specific quoting is in effect, everything between a top-level opening atom and
       its matching %(end) is evaluated according to the semantics of the opening atom and only its result from
       the top-level is quoted.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       An example directly producing formatted text. Show the most recent 3 tagged commits:

           #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>

           git for-each-ref --count=3 --sort='-*authordate' \
           --format='From: %(*authorname) %(*authoremail)
           Subject: %(*subject)
           Date: %(*authordate)
           Ref: %(*refname)

           %(*body)
           ' 'refs/tags'

       A simple example showing the use of shell eval on the output, demonstrating the use of --shell. List the
       prefixes of all heads:

           #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>

           git for-each-ref --shell --format="ref=%(refname)" refs/heads | \
           while read entry
           do
                   eval "$entry"
                   echo `dirname $ref`
           done

       A bit more elaborate report on tags, demonstrating that the format may be an entire script:

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Note that the sizes of objects on disk are reported accurately, but care should be taken in drawing
       conclusions about which refs or objects are responsible for disk usage. The size of a packed non-delta
       object may be much larger than the size of objects which delta against it, but the choice of which object
       is the base and which is the delta is arbitrary and is subject to change during a repack.

       Note also that multiple copies of an object may be present in the object database; in this case, it is
       undefined which copy’s size or delta base will be reported.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       When combining multiple <b>--contains</b> and <b>--no-contains</b> filters, only references that contain at least one
       of the <b>--contains</b> commits and contain none of the <b>--no-contains</b> commits are shown.

       When combining multiple <b>--merged</b> and <b>--no-merged</b> filters, only references that are reachable from at
       least one of the <b>--merged</b> commits and from none of the <b>--no-merged</b> commits are shown.
