</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       GoodStuff - the FVWM button panel module

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       GoodStuff is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation will work.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  GoodStuff  module  provides  a button panel which sits on the X terminal's root window. The user can
       press the buttons at any time, and trigger invocation of a user-specified command by the window  manager.
       GoodStuff only works when fvwm is used as the window manager.

       The  button  panel  can  be  of  any configuration or geometry, and can have monochrome or color icons to
       represent the actions which would be invoked.

</pre><h4><b>COPYRIGHTS</b></h4><pre>
       The GoodStuff program, and the concept for interfacing  this  module  to  the  Window  Manager,  are  all
       original work by Robert Nation

       Copyright 1993, Robert Nation. No guarantees or warranties or anything are provided or implied in any way
       whatsoever.  Use  this program at your own risk. Permission to use this program for any purpose is given,
       as long as the copyright is kept intact.

</pre><h4><b>INITIALIZATION</b></h4><pre>
       During initialization, <u>GoodStuff</u> will search for a configuration file which describes  the  button  panel
       geometry,  color, icons, and actions. The format of this files will be described later. The configuration
       file will be the one which fvwm used during its initialization.

       If the GoodStuff executable is linked to another name, ie ln -s GoodStuff TermStuff, then another  module
       called  TermStuff  can  be  started,  with a completely different configuration than GoodStuff, simply by
       changing the keywords Good??? to Term???. This way multiple button-bars can be used.

</pre><h4><b>INVOCATION</b></h4><pre>
       GoodStuff can be invoked by inserting the line 'Module GoodStuff' in the .fvwmrc file. This can be placed
       on a line by itself, if GoodStuff is to be spawned during fvwm's initialization, or can  be  bound  to  a
       menu  or  mouse  button  or  keystroke  to  invoke  it later. Fvwm will search directory specified in the
       ModulePath configuration option to attempt to locate GoodStuff.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options can be placed in the .fvwmrc file

       *GoodStuffGeometry <u>geometry</u>
              Specifies the GoodStuff window location and/or size. If the size is not specified, GoodStuff  will
              auto-size  itself  in  a  reasonable  manner.   The  geometry  is  a  standard X11 window geometry
              specification.

       *GoodStuffFont <u>font</u>
              Specifies the font to be used for labeling the buttons.

       *GoodStuffRows <u>rows</u>
              Specifies the number of rows of buttons to be created. If unspecified, 2 rows will be used.

       *GoodStuffColumns <u>columns</u>
              Specifies the number of columns of buttons to be created. If unspecified, the  number  of  columns
              will  be  set  to the number of buttons requested, divided by the number of rows. If both the rows
              and columns are specified, but do not specify as many buttons  as  are  defined,  then  the  users
              columns specification will be ignored.

       *GoodStuffFore <u>color</u>
              Specifies the color for button label text and monochrome icons.

       *GoodStuffBack <u>color</u>
              Specifies the color for the buttons.

       *GoodStuff<u>[(w</u> <u>x</u> <u>h)]</u> <u>label</u> <u>icon</u> <u>command</u>
              Specifies  a  window  manager built-in command, as described in the fvwm man page, which should be
              executed when a button is pressed. The label field is the  text  which  will  be  written  on  the
              button. The icon field specifies an X11 bitmap file or XPM color icon file, containing the icon to
              display  on  the  button. GoodStuff will search through the path specified in the fvwm IconPath or
              PixmapPath configuration items to find the icon file. If the optional <u>(w</u> <u>x</u> <u>h)</u> is  specified,  then
              this button will be <u>w</u> times the normal button width and <u>h</u> times the normal button height. If label
              is "-" then the button label will not be displayed.

              If  <u>command</u>  is  an  fvwm Exec command, then the button will remain pushed in until a window whose
              name or class matches the qouted portion of the  command  is  encountered.  This  is  intended  to
              provide  visual  feedback  to  the user that the action he has requested will be performed. If the
              qouted portion contains no characters, then the button will pop out immediately.  Note that  users
              can continue pressing the button, and re-executing the command, even when it looks "pressed in."

              A  single  extension  to  the  fvwm  built-in  command  set  is  provided.  A command of the form:
              *GoodStuff junk clock.xpm Swallow "Clock" rclock  &amp;  will  cause  GoodStuff  to  spawn  an  rclock
              process,  and  capture  the  first window whose name or resource is "Clock", and display it in the
              button-bar. This is handy for applications like xclock, xbiff, and xload. Modules can be swallowed
              by specifying  SwallowModule  instead  of  just  "swallow"  NOTE:  if  you  use  xclock  for  this
              application, you will want to specify xclock -padding 0.

</pre><h4><b>SAMPLE</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The following are excepts from a .fvwmrc file which describe GoodStuff initialization commands:

       ##############################################################
       # Load any modules which should be started during
       # fvwm initialization

       *GoodStuffRows 1
       *GoodStuffFont -adobe-helvetica-medium-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

       *GoodStuff Resize  resize.xpm  Resize

       *GoodStuff Raise   Up          Raise
       *GoodStuff Kill    bomb.xpm    Destroy

       *GoodStuff Dopey   rterm.xpm   Exec "big_win" xterm -T big_win -geometry 80x50&amp;
       *GoodStuff Snoopy  rterm.xpm   Exec "small_win" xterm -T small_wi &amp;
       *GoodStuff Xcalc   rcalc.xpm   Exec "Calculator" xcalc &amp;
       *GoodStuff XMag    magnifying_glass2.xpm    Exec "xmag" xmag &amp;
       *GoodStuff Mail    mail2.xpm   Exec "xmh" xmh &amp;
       *<a href="../man4x1/GoodStuff.4x1.html">GoodStuff</a>(4x1) - whatever SwallowModule "Fvwm Pager" FvwmPager 0 3

       The  last  line  is  a  little  tricky  -  it spawns an FvwmPager module, and captures it to display in a
       quadruple width button. Since "-" is used for the button label, the Pager will be resized to be as big as
       possible within the button's borders. "whatever", of course, is a non-existent icon  file,  and  will  be
       ignored by GoodStuff.
