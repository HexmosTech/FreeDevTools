</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SWISH-RUN - Running Swish-e and Command Line Switches

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       The Swish-e program is controlled by command line arguments (called <u>switches</u>).  Often, it is run manually
       from  a  shell  (command  prompt),  or  from  a program such as a CGI script that passes the command line
       arguments to swish.

       Note: A number of the command line switches may be specified in the Swish-e configuration file  specified
       with  the  "-c"  command  line argument.  Please see SWISH-CONFIG for a complete description of available
       configuration file directives.

       There are two basic operating modes of Swish-e: indexing and searching.  There are command line arguments
       that are unique to each mode, and others that apply to both (yet may have different meaning depending  on
       the operating mode).  These command line arguments are listed below, grouped by:

       INDEXING -- describes the command line arguments used while indexing.

       SEARCHING -- lists the command line arguments used while searching.

       OTHER SWITCHES -- lists switches that don't apply to searching or indexing.

       Beginning  with  Swish-e version 2.1, you may embed its search engine into your applications.  Please see
       SWISH-LIBRARY.

</pre><h4><b>INDEXING</b></h4><pre>
       Swish-e indexing is initiated by passing <u>command</u> <u>line</u> <u>arguments</u> to swish.   The  command  line  arguments
       used  for  <u>searching</u>  are  described in SEARCHING.  Also, see SWISH-SEARCH for examples of searching with
       Swish-e.

       Swish-e usage:

           swish-e [-i dir file ... ] [-c file] [-f file] [-l] \
                   [-v (num)] [-S method(fs⎪http⎪prog)] [-N path]

       The "-h" switch (help) will list the available Swish-e command line arguments:

           swish-e -h

       Typically, most if not all indexing settings are placed in a configuration file (specified with the  "-c"
       switch).  Once the configuration file is setup indexing is initiated as:

           swish-e -c /path/to/config/file

       See SWISH-CONFIG for information on the configuration file.

       Security  Note:  If  the  swish binary is named <u>swish-search</u> then swish will not allow any operation that
       would cause swish to write to the index file.

       When indexing it may be advisable to index to a temporary file, and then after indexing has  successfully
       completed  rename  the  file to the final location.  This is especially important when replacing an index
       that is currently in use.

           swish-e -c swish.config -f index.tmp
           [check return code from swish or look for err: output]
           mv index.tmp index.swish-e

       <b>Indexing</b> <b>Command</b> <b>Line</b> <b>Arguments</b>

       -i *directories and/or files* (input file)
           This specifies the directories and/or files to index. Directories will be indexed recursively.   This
           is  typically  specified  in  the  configuration  file  with the <b>IndexDir</b> directive instead of on the
           command line.  Use of this switch overrides the configuration file settings.

       -S [fs⎪http⎪prog] (document source/access mode)
           This specifies the method to use for accessing documents to index.  Can  be  either  "fs"  for  local
           indexing  via  the  file  system (the default), "http" for spidering, or "prog" for reading documents
           from an external program.

           Located in the "conf" directory are example configuration files that demonstrate  indexing  with  the
           different document source methods.

           See  the  SWISH-FAQ  for  a  discussion on the different indexing methods, and the difference between
           spidering with the http method vs. using the file system method.

           fs - file system
               The "fs" method simply reads files from a local (or networked) drive.  This is the default method
               if the "-S" switch is not specified.  See SWISH-CONFIG for configuration directives  specific  to
               the "fs" method.

           http - spider a web server
               The  "http"  method  is  used  to  spider web servers.  It uses an included helper program called
               <u>swishspider</u>.  See SWISH-CONFIG for configuration directives specific to the "http" method.

               Security Note: Under Windows swish passes the URLs fetched  from  remote  documents  through  the
               shell  (swish  uses  the <u>system()</u> command for running <u>swishspider</u> under Windows), and this may be
               considered an additional security risk.

               The "http" method is deprecated (or at least not very  well  appreciated).   Consider  using  the
               "prog"  method described below for spidering.  There's a spider program available in the <u>prog-bin</u>
               directory for use with the "prog" method.  Here's a number of limitation with  this  method  that
               are solved with the "prog" method:

               *   swishspider  only  spiders  standard  &lt;a  href="..."&gt;  links.  Frames and other links are not
                   followed.

               *   By default, this method of spidering only indexes files that have a content type of  "text/*"
                   (e.g. text/plain, text/html, text/xml).  You should use "DefaultContents" and "IndexContents"
                   to map file extensions to parsers used by swish (e.g.  "IndexContents HTML* .html .htm"), but
                   this will fail where a document does not have a file extension.

               *   Swish-e's  "FileFilter"  directive  can  be  used  with the "http" access method, although it
                   requires a separate process (in addition  to  the  swsihspider  process)  for  each  document
                   filtered.

               *   The SWISH::Filter modules can be used with the swishspider program.  SWISH::Filter provides a
                   general purpose filtering system (see SWISH::Filter documentation).  To use SWISH::Filter set
                   PERL5LIB   to   point   to   the   location   of  the  SWISH  module  name  space  (typically
                   /usr/local/lib/swish-e under Unix).  For example:

                      export PERL5LIB=/usr/local/lib/swish-e  # bash, bourne shells
                      setenv PERL5LIB /usr/local/lib/swish-e  # csh, tcsh

                   or under Windows

                      set PERL5LIB=c:\program files\swish-e2.4\lib\swish-e

                   SWISH::Filter is not enabled by default due to the overhead of loading the modules for  every
                   document fetched.

                   The  Swish-e  distribution  includes  perl modules in the SWISH::Filters::* namespace to make
                   converting non-text documents into a format that Swish-e can parse easy.  As mentioned above,
                   the helper script <u>swishspider</u> will use these modules if can be  found  via  PERL5LIB.   These
                   modules  only provide an interface to programs that do the conversion.  For example, you will
                   need to download and install the "catdoc" program to convert MSWord documents into  text  for
                   indexing. Please see <u>filters/README</u> to see how to use this filter system.

           prog - general purpose access method
               The  "prog"  method  is new to Swish-e version 2.2.  It's designed as a general purpose method to
               feed documents to swish from an external program.

               For example, the external program can read a database (e.g.  MySQL),  spider  a  web  server,  or
               convert  documents  from  one format to another (e.g. pdf to html).  Or, you can simply use it to
               read the files of the file system (like "-S fs"), yet provide you with full control of what files
               are indexed.

               The external program name to run is passed to swish either by the IndexDir directive, or via  the
               "-i" option.

               The program specified should be an absolute path as swish-e will attempt to <u>stat()</u> the program to
               make sure it exists.  Swish does this to help in error reporting.

               If  the program specified with -i or IndexDir is not an absolute path (i.e.  does not include "/"
               ) then swish-e will append the "libexecdir" directory defined during  configuration.   Typically,
               libexecdir  is  set  to  "$prefix/lib/swish-e"  (/usr/local/lib/swish-e),  but  is  platform  and
               installation dependent.  Running swish-e -h will report the directory.

               For example, the -S prog program "spider.pl" is a Perl helper program for use with -S prog and is
               installed in libexecdir.

                   IndexDir spider.pl
                   SwishProgParameters default <a href="http://localhost/index.html">http://localhost/index.html</a>

               and swish-e will find spider.pl in libexecdir.

               Additional parameters  may  be  passed  to  the  external  program  via  the  SwishProgParameters
               directive.   In  the  example  above swish-e will pass two parameters to spider.pl, "default" and
               "<a href="http://localhost/index.html">http://localhost/index.html</a>".

               A special name "stdin" may be used with "-i" or IndexDir which tells swish to read from  standard
               input instead of from an external program.  See example below.

               The  external  program prints to standard output (which swish captures) a set of headers followed
               by the content of the file to index.  The output looks similar to an  email  message  or  a  HTTP
               document  returned by a web server in that it includes name/value pairs of headers, a blank line,
               and the content.

               The content length is determined by a content-length header supplied to  swish  by  the  program;
               there  is  no "end of record" character or flag sent between documents. Therefore, it is critical
               that the content-length header is correct.  This is a common source of errors.

               One advantage of this method (over using filters, for example) is that the  external  program  is
               run  only  once  for  the  entire  indexing job, instead of once for every document.  This avoids
               forking and creating a new process for every document, and makes  a  huge  difference  when  your
               external program is something like perl that has a large startup cost.

               Here's a simple example written in Perl:

                   #!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
                   use strict;

                   # Build a document
                   my $doc = &lt;&lt;EOF;
                   &lt;html&gt;
                   &lt;head&gt;
                       &lt;title&gt;Document Title&lt;/title&gt;
                   &lt;/head&gt;
                       &lt;body&gt;
                           This is the text.
                       &lt;/body&gt;
                   &lt;/html&gt;
                   EOF

                   # Prepare the headers for swish
                   my $path = 'Example.file';
                   my $size = length $doc;
                   my $mtime = time;

                   # Output the document (to swish)
                   print &lt;&lt;EOF;
                   Path-Name: $path
                   Content-Length: $size
                   Last-Mtime: $mtime
                   Document-Type: HTML*

                   EOF

                       print $doc;

               The  external  program  passes  to  swish a header.  The header is separated from the body of the
               document with a blank line.  The available headers are:

               Path-Name:
                   This is the name of the file you are indexing. This can be any  string,  so  for  example  it
                   could be an ID of a record in a database, a URL or a simple file name.

                   This header is required.

               Content-Length:
                   This  header  specifies  the  length  in bytes of the document that follows the header.  This
                   length must be exactly the length of the document -- do not make the  mistake  of  adding  an
                   extra line feed at the end of the document.

                   This header is required.

               Last-Mtime:
                   Thi  parameter  is  the last modification time of the file, and must be a time stamp (seconds
                   since the Epoch on your platform).

                   This header is not required.

               Document-Type:
                   You may override swish's determination  of  document  type  ("Indexcontents")  by  using  the
                   "Document-Type:"  header.   The  document type is used to select which parser Swish-e uses to
                   parse the document's contents.

                   For example, a spider program might map the content-type returned from a web server to one of
                   the types Swish-e understands.  For example,

                       my $doc_type = 'HTML*' if $response-&gt;content_type =~ m!text/html!'

                   This header is not required.

               Update-Mode:
                   When updating an incremental index this header can be used to select the  mode  for  updating
                   the index.  There are three possible values:

                       Update
                       Remove
                       Index

                   "Update"  will  update  the  index with the given file if the date of the given file is newer
                   than the date of the file already in the index.  Setting to "Update" is the same as using  -u
                   on the command line.

                   "Remove"  mode  will  remove the file specified by the Path-Name header.  Setting "Remove" is
                   the same as using -r on the command line.

                   "Index" will add the file to the index. NOTE: swish-e will not  check  to  see  if  the  file
                   already exists.

                   If  this  header is not specified, the default is the mode specified on the command line (-u,
                   -r, or none).

                   This option is still experimental and is subject to change in the future.  Ask on the Swish-e
                   list before using.

               The above example program only returns  one  document  and  exits,  which  is  not  very  useful.
               Normally,  your  program would read data from some source, such as files or a database, format as
               XML, HTML, or text, and pass them to swish, one  after  another.   The  "Content-Length:"  header
               tells  swish  where  each  document ends -- there is not any special "end of record" character or
               marker.

               To index with the above example you need to make sure that the program is  executable  (and  that
               the  path to perl is correct), and then call swish telling to run in "prog" mode, and the name of
               the program to use for input.

                   % chmod 755 example.pl
                   % ./swish-e -S prog -i ./example.pl

               Programs can and should be tested prior to running swish. For example:

                   % ./example.pl &gt; test.out

               A few more useful example programs are provided in the swish-e distribution located in the  <u>prog-</u>
               <u>bin</u> directory.  Some include documentation:

                   % cd prog-bin
                   % perldoc spider.pl

               Others are small examples that include comments:

                   % cd prog-bin
                   % less DirTree.pl

               The  <u>spider.pl</u>  program  can  be  used  as  a replacement for the <u>-S</u> <u>http</u> method.  It is far more
               feature-rich and offers much more control over indexing.

               If you use the special program name "stdin" with "-i" or IndexDir then  swish-e  will  read  from
               standard input instead of from a program.  For example:

                   % ./example.pl --count=1000 /path/to/data ⎪ ./swish-e -S prog -i stdin

               This is basically the same as using a swish-e configuration file of:

                   SwishProgParameters --count=1000 /path/to/data
                   IndexDir ./example.pl

               in a config file and running

                   % ./swish-e -S prog -c swish.conf

               This  gives  an  easy way to run swish without a configuration file with a "-S prog" program that
               requires parameters.  It also means you can capture data to a file and then index more once  with
               the same data:

                   % ./example.pl /path/to/data --count=1000 &gt; docs.txt
                   % cat docs.txt ⎪ ./swish-e -S prog -i stdin -c normal_index
                   % cat docs.txt ⎪ ./swish-e -S prog -i stdin -c fuzzy_index

               Using  "stdin"  might  also  be useful for programs that call swish (instead of swish calling the
               program).

               (The reason "stdin" is used instead of the more common "-" dash is due to the  rotten  way  swish
               parses the command line.  This should be fixed in the future.)

               The  "prog"  method  bypasses  some  of the configuration parameters available to the file system
               method -- settings such as "IndexOnly", "FileRules", "FileMatch" and "FollowSymLinks" are ignored
               when using the "prog" method.  It's expected that these operations are better accomplished in the
               external program before passing the document onto swish.  In other words, when using  the  "prog"
               method, only send the documents to swish that you want indexed.

               You  may use swish's filter feature with the "prog" method, but performance will be better if you
               run filtering programs from within your external program.  See also <u>filters/README</u> for an example
               how to easily add document converstion and filtering into your Perl-based programs.

               <b>Notes</b> <b>when</b> <b>using</b> <b>-S</b> <b>prog</b> <b>on</b> <b>MS</b> <b>Windows</b>

               Windows does not use the shebang (#!) line of a program to determine the  program  to  run.   So,
               when  running,  for  example,  a  perl program you may need to specify the perl.exe binary as the
               program, and use the "SwishProgParameters" to name the file.

                   IndexDir e:/perl/bin/perl.exe
                   SwishProgParameters read_database.pl

               Swish will replace the forward slashes with backslashes before running the command specified with
               "IndexDir".  Swish uses the <u><a href="../man3/popen.3.html">popen</a></u>(3) command which passes the command through the shell.

       -f *indexfile* (index file)
           If you are indexing, this specifies the file to save the generated index in, and you can only specify
           one file.  See also <b>IndexFile</b> in the configuration file.

           If you are searching, this specifies the index files (one or more) to search from. The default  index
           file is index.swish-e in the current directory.

       -c *file ...* (configuration files)
           Specify  the  configuration  file(s)  to  use  for indexing.  This file contains many directives that
           control how Swish-e proceeds.   See  SWISH-CONFIG  for  a  complete  listing  of  configuration  file
           directives.

           Example:

               swish-e -c docs.conf

           If  you specify a directory to index, an index file, or the verbose option on the command-line, these
           values will override any specified in the configuration file.

           You can specify multiple configuration files.  For example, you may have one configuration file  that
           has common site-wide settings, and another for a specific index.

           Examples:

               1) swish-e -c swish-e.conf
               2) swish-e -i /usr/local/www -f index.swish-e -v -c swish-e.conf
               3) swish-e -c swish-e.conf stopwords.conf

           1  The settings in the configuration file will be used to index a site.

           2  These command-line options will override anything in the configuration file.

           3  The  variables  in  swish-e.conf  will  be read, then the variable in stopwords.conf will be read.
              Note that if the same variables occur in both files, older values may be written over.

       -e (economy mode)
           For large sites indexing may require more RAM than is available.  The "-e" switch tells swish to  use
           disk  space  to  store  data structures while indexing, saving memory.  This option is recommended if
           swish uses so much RAM that the  computer  begins  to  swap  excessively,  and  you  cannot  increase
           available memory.  The trade-off is slightly longer indexing times, and a busy disk drive.

       -l (symbolic links)
           Specifying  this  option  tells swish to follow symbolic links when indexing.  The configuration file
           value <b>FollowSymLinks</b> will override the command-line value.

           The default is not to follow symlinks.  A small improvement in indexing time my result from  enabling
           FollowSymLinks  since  swish does not need to stat every directory and file processed to determine if
           it is a symbolic link.

       -N path (index only newer files)
           The "-N" option takes a path to a file, and only files <u>newer</u> than the specified file will be indexed.
           This is helpful for creating incremental indexes -- that is, indexes that contain  just  files  added
           since the last full index was created of all files.

           Example (bad example)

               swish-e -c config.file -N index.swish-e -f index.new

           This  will  index  as  normal,  but  only files with a modified date newer than <u>index.swish-e</u> will be
           indexed.

           This is a bad example because it uses <u>index.swish-e</u> which one might  assume  was  the  date  of  last
           indexing.   The  problem  is  that  files  might  have  been added between the time indexing read the
           directory and when the <u>index.swish-e</u> file was created -- which can be quite a bit of  time  for  very
           large indexing jobs.

           The  only  solution  is to prevent any new file additions while full indexing is running.  If this is
           impossible then it will be slightly better to do this:

           Full indexing:

               touch indexing_time.file
               swish-e -c config.file -f index.tmp
               mv index.tmp index.full

           Incremental indexing:

               swish-e -c config.file -N indexing_time.file -f index.tmp
               mv index.tmp index.incremental

           Then search with

               swish-e -w foo -f index.full index.incremental

           or merge the indexes

               swish-e -M index.full index.incremental index.tmp
               mv index.tmp index.swish-e
               swish-e -w foo

       -r  <b>**incremental</b> <b>index</b> <b>format</b> <b>only**</b> The "-r" option puts swish-e into "removal" mode. Any  input  files
           (given with "-i" or the "IndexDir" parameter) are removed from an existing index.

           Example:

             swish-e -r -i file.html

           would remove <u>file.html</u> from the existing index.

       -u  <b>**incremental</b>  <b>index</b>  <b>format</b> <b>only**</b> The "-u" option puts swish-e into "update" mode. The timestamp of
           each input file is compared against the  corresponding  file  in  the  existing  index.   If  swish-e
           encounters an input file that either does not exist yet in the index or exists with a timestamp older
           than  the  input  file, the input file is updated in the index. Any words in the input file that have
           been added or removed are reflected as such in the index.

           Example:

             swish-e -i file.html -u

           would update the index.swish-e index with the contents of file.html. If file.html was new,  it  would
           be added. If file.html already existed in the index, its contents would be updated in the index.

       -v [0⎪1⎪2⎪3] (verbosity level)
           The  "-v"  option  can take a numerical value from 0 to 3.  Specify 0 for completely silent operation
           and 3 for detailed reports.

           If no value is given then 1 is assumed.  See also <b>IndexReport</b> in the configuration file.

           Warnings and errors are reported regardless of the verbosity  level.   In  addition,  all  error  and
           warnings  are written to standard out.  This is for historical reasons (many scripts exist that parse
           standard out for error messages).

       -W (0⎪1⎪2⎪3) (parser warning level)
           If using the libxml2 parser, the default parser warning level is set at 2. Use  the  "-W"  option  to
           override that default. Most often, you might want to turn it off altogether:

             swish-e -W0 -i path/to/files

           would fail silently if the parser encountered any errors.

</pre><h4><b>SEARCHING</b></h4><pre>
       The  following command line arguments are available when searching with Swish-e.  These switches are used
       to select the index to search, what fields to search, and how and what to print as results.

       This section just lists the available command line arguments and their usage.   Please  see  SWISH-SEARCH
       for detailed searching instructions.

       <b>Warning</b>: If using Swish-e via a CGI interface, please see CGI Danger!

       Security  Note:  If  the  swish binary is named <u>swish-search</u> then swish will not allow any operation that
       would cause swish to write to the index file.

       <b>Searching</b> <b>Command</b> <b>Line</b> <b>Arguments</b>

       -w *word1 word2 ...*  (query words)
           This performs a case-insensitive search using a number of keywords.  If no index file  to  search  is
           specified  (via  the  "-f"  switch),  swish-e  will  try to search a file called index.swish-e in the
           current directory.

               swish-e -w word

           Phrase searching is accomplished by placing the quote delimiter (a double-quote  by  default)  around
           the search phrase.

               swish-e -w 'word or "this phrase"'

           Search  would  should  be  protected from the shell by quotes.  Typically, this is single quotes when
           running under Unix.

           Under Windows <u>command.com</u> you may not need to use quotes, but you will need to backslash  the  quotes
           used to delimit phrases:

               swish-e -w \"a phrase\"

           The phrase delimiter can be set with the "-P" switch.

           The search may be limited to a <u>MetaName</u>.  For example:

               swish-e -w meta1=(foo or baz)

           will only search within the <b>meta1</b> tag.

           Please see SWISH-SEARCH for a description of MetaNames

       -f *file1 file2 ...* (index files)
           Specifies  the  index  file(s) used while searching.  More than one file may be listed, and each file
           will be searched.  If no "-f" switch  is  specified  then  the  file  <u>index.swish-e</u>  in  the  current
           directory will be used as the index file.

       -m *number* (max results)
           While  searching,  this  specifies the maximum number of results to return.  The default is to return
           all results.

           This switch is often used in conjunction with the "-b" switch to return results one page  at  a  time
           (strongly recommended for large indexes).

       -b *number* (beginning result)
           Sets  the  <u>begining</u>  search  result to return (records are numbered from 1).  This switch can be used
           with the "-m" switch to return results in groups or pages.

           Example:

               swish-e -w 'word' -b 1 -m 20    # first 'page'
               swish-e -w 'word' -b 21 -m 20   # second 'page'

       -t HBthec (context searching)
           The "-t" option allows you to search for words that exist only in specific HTML tags. Each  character
           in  the  string  you  specify  in  the argument to this option represents a different tag in which to
           search for the word. H means all HEAD tags, B stands for BODY tags, t is all TITLE tags, h is  H1  to
           H6 (header) tags, e is emphasized tags (this may be B, I, EM, or STRONG), and c is HTML comment tags

           search only in header (&lt;H*&gt;) tags

               swish-e -w word -t h

       -d *string* (delimiter)
           Set  the  delimiter used when printing results.  By default, Swish-e separates the output fields by a
           space, and places double-quotes around the document title.  This output may be hard to parse,  so  it
           is recommended to use "-d" to specify a character or string used as a separator between fields.

           The string "dq" means "double-quotes".

               swish-e -w word -d ,    # single char
               swish-e -w word -d ::   # string
               swish-e -w word -d '"'  # double quotes under Unix
               swish-e -w word -d \"   # double quotes under Windows
               swish-e -w word -d dq   # double quotes

           The following control characters may also be specified: "\t \r \n \f".

           Warning:  This  string  is passed directly to <u>sprintf()</u> and therefore exposes a securty hole.  Do not
           allow user data to set -d format strings directly.

       -P *character*
           Sets the delimiter used for phrase searches.  The default is double quotes """.

           Some examples under bash: (be careful about you shell metacharacters)

               swish-e -P ^ -w 'title=^words in a phrase^'
               swish-e -P \' -w "title='words in a pharse"'

       -p *property1 property2 ...*  (display properties)
           This causes swish to print the listed property in the search results.  The properties are returned in
           the order they are listed in the "-p" argument.

           Properties are defined by the <b>ProperNames</b> directive in the configuration file (see SWISH-CONFIG)  and
           properties  must also be defined in <b>MetaNames</b>.  Swish stores the text of the meta name as a <u>property</u>,
           and then will return this text while searching if this option is used.

           Properties are very useful for returning data included in a source documnet without having to re-read
           the source document while searching.  For example, this could be used  to  return  a  short  document
           description.  See also see <b>Document</b> <b>Summeries</b> and PropertyNames in SWISH-CONFIG.

           To return the subject and category properties while indexing.

               swish-e -w word -p subject category

           Properties  are returned in double quotes.   If a property contains a double quote it is HTML escaped
           (&amp;quot;).  See the "-x" switch for a more advanced method of returning a list of properties.

           NOTE: it is necessary to have indexed with the proper PropertyNames directive in the user config file
           in order to use this option.

       -s *property [asc⎪desc] ...*  (sort)
           Normally, search results are printed out in order of relevancy, with the most relevant listed  first.
           The  "-s"  sort  switch allows you to sort results in order of a specified <u>property</u>, where a <u>property</u>
           was defined using the <b>MetaNames</b> and <b>PropertyNames</b> directives during indexing (see SWISH-CONFIG).

           The string passed can include the strings "asc" and "desc" to specify the sort order, and  more  than
           one property may be specified to sort on more than one key.

           Examples:

           sort by title property ascending order

               -s title

           sort descending by title, ascending by name

               -s title desc name asc

           Note:   Swish  limits  sort  keys  to  100  characters.   This  limit  can  be  changed  by  changing
           MAX_SORT_STRING_LEN in src/config.h and rebuilding swish-e.

       -L limit to a range of property values (Limit)
           <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>feature!</b>

           The "-L" switch can be used to limit search results to a range of property values

           Example:

               swish-e -w foo -L swishtitle a m

           finds all documents that contain the word "foo", and where the document's title is in  the  range  of
           "a"  to  "m", inclusive.  By default, the case of the property is ignored, but this can be changed by
           using PropertyNamesCompareCase configuation directive.

           Limiting may be done with user-defined properties, as well.

           For example, if you indexed documents that contain a created timestamp in a meta tag:

               &lt;meta name="created_on" content="982648324"&gt;

           Then you tell Swish that you have a property called "created_on", and that it's a timestamp.

               PropertyNamesDate created_on

           After indexing you will be able to limit documents to a range of timestamps:

               -w foo -L created_on  946684800 949363199

           will find documents containing the word foo and that have a created_on date from the start of Jan  1,
           2000 to the end of Jan 31, 2000.

           Note: swish currently does not parse dates; Unix timestamps must be used.

           Two special formats can be used:

               -L swishtitle &lt;= m
               -L swishtitle &gt;= m

           Finds titles less than or equal, or grater than or equal to the letter "m".

           This feature will not work with "swishrank" or "swishdbfile" properties.

           This  feature  takes  advantages of the pre-sorted tables built by swish during indexing to make this
           feature fast while searching.  You should see in the indexing output a line such as:

              6 properties sorted.

           That indicates that six pre-sorted tables were built during indexing.  By default, all properties are
           presorted while indexing.  What properties are pre-sorted can  be  controlled  by  the  configuration
           parameter "PreSortedIndex".

           Using  the  "-L" switch on a property that was not pre-sorted will still work, but may be <u>much</u> slower
           during searching.

           Note that the PropertyNamesSortKeyLength setting is used for sorting properties.  Using too  small  a
           PropertyNamesSortKeyLength  could  result  in  -L  selecting  the  wrong properties due to incomplete
           sorting.

           This is an experimental feature, and its use and interface are subject to change.

       -x formatstring (extended output format)
           The "-x" switch defines the output format string.  The format  string  can  contain  plain  text  and
           property  names  (including swish-defined internal property names) and is used to generate the output
           for every result.  In addition, the output format of the property name can be controlled with  C-like
           printf format strings.  This feature overrides the cmdline switches "-d" and "-p", and a warning will
           be generated if "-d" or "-p" are used with "-x".

           Warning:  The  format  string  (fmt)  is passed directly to <u>sprintf()</u> and therefore exposes a securty
           hole.  Do not allow user data to set -x format strings directly.

           For example, to return just the title, one per line, in the search results:

               swish-e  -w ...   -x '&lt;swishtitle&gt;\n' ...

           Note: the "\n" may need to be protected from your shell.

           See also ResultExtFormatName for a way to define <u>named</u> format  strings  in  the  swish  configuration
           file.

           <b>Format</b> <b>of</b> <b>"formatstring":</b>

               "text&lt;propertyname&gt;text&lt;propertyname fmt=propfmtstr&gt;text..."

           Where <b>propertyname</b> is:

           *   the name of a user property as specified with the config file directive "PropertyNames"

           *   the  name  of  a  swish Auto property (see below).  These properties are defined automatically by
               swish -- you do not need to specify them with PropertyNames directive.  (This may change  in  the
               future.)

           propertynames must be placed within "&lt;" and "&gt;".

           <b>User</b> <b>properties:</b>

           Swish-e  allows  you  to specify certain META tags within your documents that can be used as <b>document</b>
           <b>properties</b>.  The contents of any META tag that has been identified as  a  document  property  can  be
           returned as part of the search results.  Doucment properties must be defined while indexing using the
           <b>PropertyNames</b> configuration directive (see SWISH-CONFIG).

           Examples of user-defined PropertyNames:

               &lt;keywords&gt;
               &lt;author&gt;
               &lt;deliveredby&gt;
               &lt;reference&gt;
               &lt;id&gt;

           <b>Auto</b> <b>properties:</b>

           Swish  defines  a  number  of  "Auto"  properties for each document indexed.  These are available for
           output when using the "-x" format.

               Name               Type     Contents
               --------------     -------  ----------------------------------------------
               swishreccount      Integer  Result record counter
               swishtitle         String   Document title
               swishrank          Integer  Result rank for this hit
               swishdocpath       String   URL or filepath to document
               swishdocsize       Integer  Document size in bytes
               swishlastmodified  Date     Last modified date of document
               swishdescription   String   Description of document (see:StoreDescription)
               swishdbfile        String   Path of swish database indexfile

           The Auto properties can also be specified using shortcuts:

                 %t        swishtitle

           For example, these are equivalent:

              -x '&lt;swishrank&gt;:&lt;swishdocpath&gt;:&lt;swishtitle&gt;\n'
              -x '%r:%p:%t\n'

           Use a double percent sign "%%" to enter a literal percent sign in the output.

           <b>Formatstrings</b> <b>of</b> <b>properties:</b>

           Properties  listed  in  an  "-x"  format  string  can  include   format   control   strings.    These
           "propertyformats"  are  used  to  control  how  the  contents of the associated property are printed.
           Property formats are used like C-language printf  formats.   The  property  format  is  specified  by
           including the attribute "fmt" within the property tag.

           Format strings cannot be used with the "%" shortcuts described above.

           General syntax:

               -x '&lt;propertyname fmt="propfmtstr"&gt;'

           where "subfmt" controls the output format of "propertyname".

           Examples of property format strings:

                   date type:    &lt;swishlastmodified fmt="%d.%m.%Y"&gt;
                   string type:  &lt;swishtitle fmt="%-40.35s"&gt;
                   integer type: &lt;swishreccount fmt=/%8.8d/&gt;

           Please  see  the  manual  pages  for <u><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a></u>(3) and <u><a href="../man3/sprintf.3.html">sprintf</a></u>(3) for an explanation of format strings.
           Note: some versions of strftime do not offer the %s  format  string  (number  of  seconds  since  the
           Epoch),  so  swish  provides a special format string "%ld" to display the number of seconds since the
           Epoch.

           The first character of a property format string defines the delimiter for  the  format  string.   For
           example,

               -x  "&lt;author  fmt=[%20s]&gt; ...\n"
               -x  "&lt;author  fmt='%20s'&gt; ...\n"
               -x  "&lt;author  fmt=/%20s/&gt; ...\n"

           <b>Standard</b> <b>predefined</b> <b>formats:</b>

           If you ommit the sub-format, the following formats are used:

               String type:       "%s"  (like printf char *)
               Integer type:      "%d"  (like printf int)
               Float type:        "%f"  (like printf double)
               Date type:         "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" (like strftime)

           <b>Text</b> <b>in</b> <b>"formatstring"</b> <b>or</b> <b>"propfmtstr":</b>

           Text will be output as-is in format strings (and property format strings).  Special characters can be
           escaped  with  a  backslash.  To get a new line for each result hit, you have to include the Newline-
           Character "\n" at the end of "fmtstr".

               -x "&lt;swishreccount&gt;⎪&lt;swishrank&gt;⎪&lt;swishdocpath&gt;\n"
               -x "Count=&lt;swishreccount&gt;, Rank=&lt;swishrank&gt;\n"
               -x "Title=\&lt;b\&gt;&lt;swishtitle&gt;\&lt;/b\&gt;"
               -x 'Date: &lt;swishlastmodified fmt="%m/%d/%Y"&gt;\n'
               -x 'Date in seconds: &lt;swishlastmodified fmt=/%ld/&gt;\n'

           <b>Control/Escape</b> <b>charcters:</b>

           you can use C-like control escapes in the format string:

              known controls:      \a, \b, \f, \n, \r, \t, \v,
              digit escapes:       \xhexdigits   \0octaldigits
              character escapes:   \anychar

           Example,

               swish -x "%c\t%r\t%p\t\"&lt;swishtitle fmt=/%40s/&gt;\"\n"

           <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>-x</b> <b>format</b> <b>strings:</b>

               -x "%c⎪%r⎪%p⎪%t⎪%D⎪%d\n"
               -x "%c⎪%r⎪%p⎪%t⎪&lt;swishdate fmt=/%A, %d. %B %Y/&gt;⎪%d\n"
               -x "&lt;swishrank&gt;\t&lt;swishdocpath&gt;\t&lt;swishtitle&gt;\t&lt;keywords&gt;\n
               -x "xml_out: \&lt;title\&gt;&lt;swishtitle&gt;\&gt;\&lt;/title\&gt;\n"
               -x "xml_out: &lt;swishtitle fmt='&lt;title&gt;%s&lt;/title&gt;'&gt;\n"

       -H [0⎪1⎪2⎪3⎪&lt;n&gt;]  (header output verbosity)
           The "-H n" switch generates extened <u>header</u> output.  This is most useful when searching more than  one
           index  file  at  a  time  by  specifying  more than one index file with the "-f" switch.  "-H 2" will
           generate a set of headers specific to each index file.  This gives access to  the  settings  used  to
           generate each index file.

           Even  when searching a single index file, "-H n" will provided additional information about the index
           file, how it was indexed, and how swish is interperting the query.

               -H 0 : print no header information, output only search result entries.
               -H 1 : print standard result header (default).
               -H 2 : print additional header information for each searched index file.
               -H 3 : enhanced header output (e.g. print stopwords).
               -H 9 : print diagnostic information in the header of the results (changed from: C&lt;-v 4&gt;)

       -R [0⎪1] (Ranking Scheme)
           <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>feature!</b>

           The default ranking scheme in SWISH-E evaluates each word in a query in terms of  its  frequency  and
           position in each document. The default scheme is 0.

           New  in  version  2.4.3 you may optionally select an experimental ranking scheme that, in addition to
           document frequency and position, uses Inverse Document Frequency (IDF), or the relative frequency  of
           each  word  across  all the indexes being searched, and Relative Density, or the normalization of the
           frequency of a word in relationship to the number of words in the document.

           <b>NOTE:</b> IgnoreTotalWordCountWhenRanking must be set to <b>no</b> or <b>0</b> in your index(es) for -R 1 to work.

           Specify -R 1 to turn on IDF ranking. See the API documentation for how to set the ranking  scheme  in
           your Perl or C program.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>SWITCHES</b></h4><pre>
       -V (version)
           Print the current version.

       -k *letter* (print out keywords)
           The  "-k"  switch  is  used  for  testing and will cause swish to print out all keywords in the index
           beginning with that letter.  You may enter "-k '*'" to generate a list of all words indexed by swish.

       -D *index file*  (debug index)
           The -D option is no longer supported in version 2.2.

       -T *options* (trace/debug swish)
           The -T option is used to  print  out  information  that  may  be  helpful  when  debugging  swish-e's
           operation.  This option replaced the "-D" option of previous versions.

           Running "-T help" will print out a list of available *options*

</pre><h4><b>Merging</b> <b>Index</b> <b>Files</b></h4><pre>
       In  previous  versions  of  Swish-e indexing would require a very large amount of memory and the indexing
       process could be very slow.  Merging provided a way to index in  chunks  and  then  combine  the  indexes
       together into a single index.

       Indexing  is  much  faster  now and uses much less memory, and with the "-e" switch very little memory is
       needed to index a large site.

       Still, at times it can be useful to merge different index files into one file for searching.  This  could
       be  because  you  want  to  keep  separate site indexes and a common one for a global search, or you have
       separate collections of documents that you wish to search all at one time, but manage separately.

       -M *index1 index2 ... indexN out_index
           Merges the indexes specified on the command line -- the last file name entered is  the  output  file.
           The output index must not exist (otherwise merge will not proceed).

           Only indexes that were indexed with common settings may be merged.  (e.g. don't mix stemming and non-
           stemming indexes, or indexes with different WordCharacter settings, etc.).

           Use the "-e" switch while merging to reduce memory usage.

           Merge generates progress messages regardless of the setting of "-v".

       -c *configuration file*
           Specify  a  configuration  file  while indexing to add administrative information to the output index
           file.
