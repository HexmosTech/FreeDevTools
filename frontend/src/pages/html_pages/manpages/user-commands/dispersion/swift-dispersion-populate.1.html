       <b>swift-dispersion-populate</b> - OpenStack Swift dispersion populate

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>swift-dispersion-populate</b>  <b>[--container-suffix-start]</b> <b>[--object-suffix-start]</b> <b>[--container-only|--object-</b>
       <b>only]</b> <b>[--insecure]</b> <b>[conf_file]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is one of the swift-dispersion utilities that is used to evaluate the overall cluster  health.  This
       is  accomplished by checking if a set of deliberately distributed containers and objects are currently in
       their proper places within the cluster.

       For instance, a common deployment has three replicas of each object.  The health of that  object  can  be
       measured  by checking if each replica is in its proper place. If only 2 of the 3 is in place the object's
       health can be said to be at 66.66%, where 100% would be perfect.

       We need to place the containers  and  objects  throughout  the  system  so  that  they  are  on  distinct
       partitions.  The  <b>swift-dispersion-populate</b> tool does this by making up random container and object names
       until they fall on distinct partitions. Last, and repeatedly for the life of the cluster, we need to  run
       the <b>swift-dispersion-report</b> tool to check the health of each of these containers and objects.

       These  tools  need direct access to the entire cluster and to the ring files.  Installing them on a proxy
       server will probably do or a box used for swift administration purposes that  also  contains  the  common
       swift  packages  and  ring.   Both  <b>swift-dispersion-populate</b>  and  <b>swift-dispersion-report</b>  use the same
       configuration file, /etc/swift/dispersion.conf . The account used by these tool  should  be  a  dedicated
       account for the dispersion stats and also have admin privileges.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--insecure</b>
              Allow accessing insecure keystone server. The keystone's certificate will not be verified.

       <b>--container-suffix-start=NUMBER</b>
              Start container suffix at NUMBER and resume population at this point; default: 0

       <b>--object-suffix-start=NUMBER</b>
              Start object suffix at NUMBER and resume population at this point; default: 0

       <b>--object-only</b>
              Only run object population

       <b>--container-only</b>
              Only run container population

       <b>--no-overlap</b>
              Increase  coverage  by amount in dispersion_coverage option with no overlap of existing partitions
              (if run more than once)

       <b>-P,</b> <b>--policy-name</b>
              Specify storage policy name

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Example <u>/etc/swift/dispersion.conf</u>:

          [dispersion]
          auth_url = https://127.0.0.1:443/auth/v1.0
          auth_user = dpstats:dpstats
          auth_key = dpstats
          swift_dir = /etc/swift
          # project_name = dpstats
          # project_domain_name = default
          # user_domain_name = default
          # dispersion_coverage = 1.0
          # retries = 5
          # concurrency = 25
          # endpoint_type = publicURL

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       $ swift-dispersion-populate
        Created 2621 containers for dispersion reporting, 38s, 0 retries
        Created 2621 objects for dispersion reporting, 27s, 0 retries
