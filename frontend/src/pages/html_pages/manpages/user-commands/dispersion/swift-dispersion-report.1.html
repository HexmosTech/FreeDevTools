       <b>swift-dispersion-report</b> - OpenStack Swift dispersion report

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>swift-dispersion-report</b>  <b>[-d|--debug]</b> <b>[-j|--dump-json]</b> <b>[-p|--partitions]</b> <b>[--container-only|--object-only]</b>
       <b>[--insecure]</b> <b>[conf_file]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is one of the swift-dispersion utilities that is used to evaluate the overall cluster  health.  This
       is  accomplished by checking if a set of deliberately distributed containers and objects are currently in
       their proper places within the cluster.

       For instance, a common deployment has three replicas of each object.  The health of that  object  can  be
       measured  by checking if each replica is in its proper place. If only 2 of the 3 is in place the object's
       health can be said to be at 66.66%, where 100% would be perfect.

       Once the <b>swift-dispersion-populate</b> has been used to populate the dispersion account, one should  run  the
       <b>swift-dispersion-report</b> tool repeatedly for the life of the cluster, in order to check the health of each
       of these containers and objects.

       These  tools  need direct access to the entire cluster and to the ring files.  Installing them on a proxy
       server will probably do or a box used for swift administration purposes that  also  contains  the  common
       swift  packages  and  ring.   Both  <b>swift-dispersion-populate</b>  and  <b>swift-dispersion-report</b>  use the same
       configuration file, /etc/swift/dispersion.conf . The account used by these tool  should  be  a  dedicated
       account for the dispersion stats and also have admin privileges.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d,</b> <b>--debug</b>
              output any 404 responses to standard error

       <b>-j,</b> <b>--dump-json</b>
              output dispersion report in json format

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--partitions</b>
              output the partition numbers that have any missing replicas

       <b>--container-only</b>
              Only run the container report

       <b>--object-only</b>
              Only run the object report

       <b>--insecure</b>
              Allow accessing insecure keystone server. The keystone's certificate will not be verified.

       <b>-P,</b> <b>--policy-name</b>
              Specify storage policy name

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Example <u>/etc/swift/dispersion.conf</u>:

          [dispersion]
          auth_url = https://127.0.0.1:443/auth/v1.0
          auth_user = dpstats:dpstats
          auth_key = dpstats
          swift_dir = /etc/swift
          # project_name = dpstats
          # project_domain_name = default
          # user_domain_name = default
          # dispersion_coverage = 1.0
          # retries = 5
          # concurrency = 25
          # dump_json = no
          # endpoint_type = publicURL

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       $ swift-dispersion-report

        Queried 2622 containers for dispersion reporting, 31s, 0 retries
        100.00% of container copies found (7866 of 7866)
        Sample represents 1.00% of the container partition space

        Queried 2621 objects for dispersion reporting, 22s, 0 retries
        100.00% of object copies found (7863 of 7863)
        Sample represents 1.00% of the object partition space
