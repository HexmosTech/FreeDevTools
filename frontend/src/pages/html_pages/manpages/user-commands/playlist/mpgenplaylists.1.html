</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mpgenplaylists - generate mpd playlists for each subdirectory of music

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       mpgenplaylists

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mpgenplaylists</b> generates mpd playlists.

       It reads your <a href="file:~/.mpdconf">~/.mpdconf</a> or /etc/mpd.conf to figure out where mpd keeps its music directory and playlist
       directory.

       For each subdirectory of the music directory, a playlist is generated in the playlist directory. The
       playlists created by this tool always start with a space to avoid conflicts with your manually created
       playlists.

       So if you keep your sound in Artist/Album/ directories, you'll get playlists named like " Artist -
       Album", and also playlists named just " Artist" that contain all music by that artist. An " all" playlist
       is also created, that contains all your music.

       Each time it's run it updates the playlists, and removes any obsolete ones that it created before.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       It does not currently sort songs in an album by track number, but instead sorts by filename.
