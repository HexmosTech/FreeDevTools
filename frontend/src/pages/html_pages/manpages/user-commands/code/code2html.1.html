</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       code2html - Converts a program source code to HTML

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       (1) <b>code2html</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>input-file</u> [<u>output-file</u>]]

       (2) <b>code2html</b> <b>-p</b> [<u>file</u> [<u>alternate-outfile</u>]]

       (3) <b>code2html</b> (as a CGI script; see the section on <u>CGI</u>)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>code2html</b>  is a perl script which converts a program source code to syntax highlighted HTML, or any other
       format for wich rules are defined.

   <b>(1)</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <u>input-file</u>
               Is the file which contains the program source code to be formatted.  If not specified or a  minus
               (-) is given, the code will be read from STDIN.

       <u>output-file</u>
               Is  the  file to write the formatted code to.  If not specified or a minus (-) is given, the code
               will be written to STDOUT.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--language-mode</b>
               Specify the set of regular expressions to use.  These have to be defined in a language file  (see
               <b>FILES</b> below).  To find out which language modes are defined, issue a <b>code2html</b> <b>--modes</b>.

               This input is treated case-insensitive.

               If not given, some heuristics will be used to determine the file language.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
               Prints progress information to STDERR.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--linenumbers</b>
               Print out the source code with line numbers.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--linknumbers</b>
               Print  out  the  source  code  with line numbers.  The linenumbers will link to themselves, which
               makes it easy to send links to lines.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--prefix</b>
               Optional prefix to use for line number anchors.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--replace-tabs</b>[=<u>TABSTOP-WIDTH</u>]
               Replace each occurence of a &lt;TAB&gt; character with the right amount of spaces to get  to  the  next
               tabstop.  Default is a tabstop width of 8 characters.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--language-file</b>=<u>LANGUAGE-FILE</u>
               Specify  an  alternate  file  to  take  the  language and output-format definitions from (see the
               section on <b>FILES</b> below).

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--modes</b>
               Print all language modes and output-formats currently defined to  STDOUT  and  exit  succesfully.
               Also prints modes from a <u>LANGUAGE-FILE</u> given by <b>--language-file</b> if applicable.

       <b>--fallback</b>=<u>LANG</u>
               If the language mode given with <b>--language-mode</b> cannot be found then use this mode.

               <b>--fallback</b>  <b>plain</b> for instance is usefull when <b>code2html</b> is called from a script to ensure output
               is created.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
               Print a short help and exit succesfully.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
               Print the program version and exit succesfully.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--content-type</b>
               Prints ”Content-Type: text/html\n\n“ (or whatever the output-format defines  as  a  content-type)
               prior to the rest of the output.  Usefull if the script is ivoked as a cgi script.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--output-format</b>
               Selects  the  output-format.  html  is the default.  To find out which outputformats are defined,
               issue a <b>code2html</b> <b>--modes</b>.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--no-header</b>
               do not make use of the template defined by the output-format.  For HTML  this  means  that  there
               will be no &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, and no &lt;typical for patch and CGI modes,pre&gt; tags.

       <b>--template</b>=<u>FILE</u>
               overrides  the  default  template for the given output format.  If <b>--no-header</b> is given too, this
               has no meaning, since the template is ignored anyway.

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--title</b>
               Set the title of the produced output file.  Only works if the template does support  setting  the
               title.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--linewidth</b>=<u>LINEWIDTH</u>
               Wrap lines after <u>LINEWIDTH</u> characters. Default is to not wrap lines at all.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--linebreakprefix</b>=<u>LINEPREFIX</u>
               Use <u>fILINEPREFIX</u> at the start of wrapped lines. Default is "» ".

   <b>(2)</b> <b>HTML</b> <b>patching</b>
       <b>code2html</b> <b>-p</b> [<u>file</u> [<u>alternate-outfile</u>]]

       <b>code2html</b>  also  allows  you to have inline source code in an html file.  It can then take this html file
       and insert the syntax highlighted code.

       If no file is given, <b>code2html</b> reads from STDIN and writes to STDOUT.  If  just  one  file  is  given  it
       replaces this file with the output.  If two files are provided, the first one is read from and the second
       one written to.

       To use this feature, just insert a like like this into your html file:

              &lt;!-- code2html add [options] &lt;file&gt; --&gt;

       the syntax highlighted file will be inserted at this position enclosed in &lt;pre&gt; tags.

       All  options that can be given on the command line like <b>--linenumbers</b> etc. work.  <b>--help</b>, <b>--version</b>, etc.
       work too however it is not very intelligent to use them :).  Using <b>--output-format</b> to choose  a  non-HTML
       outputformat is not adviseable.  <b>--content-type</b> is ignored.

       You may also write the program's source code directly in the html file with the following syntax:

              &lt;!-- code2html add [options]

              &lt;your program source code here&gt;

              --&gt;

       It is usually a good idea to at least give the <b>--language-mode</b> option to specify the language.

   <b>(3)</b> <b>CGI</b>
       If  the  the  script  is  used  as  a  CGI  script (<b>GATEWAY_INTERFACE</b> environment set and no command line
       arguments given) <b>code2html</b> reads the arguments either from the query string or from SDTIN.  (methods POST
       and GET).

       <b>--content-type</b> is switched on automatically and the output always goes to STDOUT.

       The following parameters/options are accepted:

       <b>language-mode</b> - optional
               `c', `cc', `pas', etc.

               if not given, some heuristics are used to find out the language.

       <b>fallback</b> - optional
               `plain', `c', etc. if language-mode cannot be found, use this one

       <b>input-selector</b> - optional
               either `file', `cgi-input1', `cgi-input2', or `REDIRECT_URL'

               default: file

       <b>filename</b>
               file to read from if <b>input-selector</b> is `file'

       <b>cgi-input1</b>
               The source code to syntax highlight.  For example from a &lt;textarea&gt; or from a upload.  See <b>input-</b>
               <b>selector</b>.

       <b>cgi-input2</b>
               The source code to syntax highlight.  For example from a &lt;textarea&gt; or from a upload.  See <b>input-</b>
               <b>selector</b>.

       <b>line-numbers</b> - optional
               `yes', `no' or `link'

               default: no

       <b>replace-tabs</b> - optional
               If 0 then tabs are not replaced, else replace each occurence of a &lt;TAB&gt; character with the  right
               amount of spaces to get to the next tabstop.

               default: 0

       <b>title</b> - optional
               Set's the title of the file.

       <b>no-encoding</b> - optional
               By  default  <b>code2html</b>  tries to encode the output as either <b>bz2</b>/<b>gz</b>/<b>Z</b> if the client supports this
               (<b>HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING</b>) and the needed program is available on the server.  You may need to modify
               <b>@CGI_ENCODING</b> in the script to match your program locations.

               If <b>no-encoding</b> is defined as “true” <b>code2html</b> does not try to encode the output.

       Why two cgi-inputs you may ask: This is to allow your users to choose vie a &lt;form&gt; interface whether they
       want to insert their file into a &lt;textarea&gt; or user a &lt;browse&gt; button  to  select  their  file.  See  the
       example on my home- page.

       Note  that if <b>$FILES_DISALLOWED_IN_CGI</b> is 0 it is possbile for your users to read all the files the httpd
       can read (if you don't run a cgi- wrapper or something like this. By default this value is set to  1,  so
       file  reading  via cgi should not be allowed. You can allow it with setting <b>$FILES_DISALLOWED_IN_CGI</b> to 0
       at the top of the script.

       The input selector <b>REDIRECT_URL</b> needs a special explaination. The  file  name  is  formed  from  the  two
       enviroment variables <b>DOCUMENT_ROOT</b> and <b>REDIRECT_URL</b>.

       If  you  want apache to automatically call <b>code2html</b> for all program source code files you may do this by
       adding these two lines to your srm.conf:

              AddHandler text/x-sourcecode .c .cc .cpp .pas .h .p

              Action text/x-sourcecode /cgi-bin/code2html?input-selector=REDIRECT_URL&amp;foo=

       or something similar to this. In the AddHandle line you can  choose  which  extensions  to  pass  through
       <b>code2html</b>.

       <b>WARNING</b>: Do not add .pl to this line and name this script “code2html.pl”. This will result in a loop.

       Also make sure that you load the Action module (srm.conf).

       Replace  /cgi-bin/code2html  with  the  virtual  location  under which the file can be accessed. Note the
       “foo=” part.  Apache appends the URL of the file to display at the end of the action part. We do not need
       this since we use the environment variable <b>REDIRECT_URL</b> however we do not want to get the  url  addes  to
       the input-selector string.  Therefore we append the “&amp;foo=” part.

       Tnx to Kevin Burton &lt;<a href="mailto:burton@relativity.yi.org">burton@relativity.yi.org</a>&gt; for the idea.  He also states that

       &gt; It is more powerfull if you use it in an Apache
       &gt; &lt;Directory&gt; tag
       &gt;
       &gt; &lt;Directory /source&gt;
       &gt;
       &gt;  #with your Action tag here... this way you can
       &gt;  #still have regular .java files on your server.
       &gt;
       &gt; &lt;/Directory&gt;
       &gt;

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       assuming <b>code2html</b> is in the current directory, you may type

                                     code2html -l perl code2html.pl code2html.html

       to convert the script into a html file.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Code2html</b> looks for it's configuration in several places.

       •   the file specified by <b>-L</b> or <b>--language-file</b> if any

       •   the files specified in the evironment variable <b>CODE2HTML_CONFIG</b>, seperated by colons

       •   user's <u>$HOME/.code2html.config</u>

       •   <u>/etc/code2html.config</u>

       •   built in default languages

       Entries in a file that is mentioned earlier in this list override rules from later files.

       The file structure must be valid perl code.

       The  global  variables  <b>%LANGUAGE</b>  and  <b>%STYLESHEET</b> are already defined, so you should not redeclare them
       using “my”.

       When you are looking for a model configuration to serve as a basis for your own configuration file, it is
       probably best to start out by checking the built-in definitions at the bottom of <b>code2html</b>.

       If your pattern includes back references like a lot patterns do in perl for example, then you have to use
       \2 instead of \1, \3 instead of \2 and so on.  I really don't like this hack but it is a lot faster.

       Example:

                                                   &lt;&lt;([^\n]*).*?^\2$

       In this example the perl &lt;&lt; stuff is matched, i.e. everything from a &lt;&lt; until a  line  that  consists  of
       exactly the same string as behind the &lt;&lt; was.  The \2 references the matched chars in the parentenses.

       If  you  ever write language specific rule files yourself, I'd be grateful if you could send those to me,
       so I could make them available (with full credits of course) on my homepage for anyone to grab,  whenever
       some of those files suit someone else's needs.  Before you do so you might also have a look at my site to
       check wheter someone has already written a rule file for your favourite language.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The  language  recognition  mechanism relies on specific patterns within the file name and the content of
       the processed file, such as file name extensions and shebangs (#!).  This means that if the  input  is  a
       pipe  or  a  socket,  the file name does not follow traditional naming conventions, or the content of the
       processed file is incomplete, the input language name  should  be  specified  using  the  <b>--language-mode</b>
       command line parameter.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Please  report  bugs  to  <a href="mailto:code2html@palfrader.org">code2html@palfrader.org</a>.   This  program is still a beta release, so you should
       expect to find some.
       Also  have   a   look   at   my   web-site,   perhaps   a   new   version   is   available   already   at
       <u><a href="http://www.palfrader.org/code2html/">http://www.palfrader.org/code2html/</a></u>.
