       misspell-fixer - misspell-fixer

       Utility  to  fix  common  misspellings,  typos  in source code. There are lots of typical misspellings in
       program code. Typically they are more eye-catching in the  living  code  but  they  can  easily  hide  in
       comments,  examples,  samples,  notes  and documentation. With this utility you can fix a large number of
       them very quickly.

       Be aware that the utility does not check or fix file names. It could easily happen that a misspelled word
       is fixed in a file name in a program's code, but the file itself will not be renamed by this utility.

       It is also important to be very careful when fixing public APIs!

       A manual review is always needed to verify that nothing has been broken.

   <b>Synopsis</b>
       misspell-fixer [OPTION] target[s]

   <b>Options,</b> <b>Arguments</b>
       <b>target[s]</b> can be any file[s] or directory/ies.

       Main options:

       ○   <b>-r</b> Real run mode: Overwrites the original files with the fixed one. Without this option the originals
           will be untouched.

       ○   <b>-n</b> Disable backups. (By default the modified files' originals will be saved with the <b>.$$.BAK</b> suffix.)

       ○   <b>-P</b> <b>n</b> Enable processing on <b>n</b> forks. For example: <b>-P</b> <b>4</b> processes the files in 4 threads. (<b>-s</b> option  is
           not supported)

       ○   <b>-f</b> Fast mode. (Equivalent with <b>-P4</b>)

       ○   <b>-h</b> Help.

       Performance  note:  <b>-s</b>, <b>-v</b> or the lack of <b>-n</b> or <b>-r</b> use a slower processing internal loop. So usually <b>-frn</b>
       without <b>-s</b> and <b>-v</b> are the highest performing combination.

       Output control options:

       ○   <b>-s</b> Shows diffs of changes.

       ○   <b>-v</b> Verbose mode: shows the iterated files. (Without the prefiltering step)

       ○   <b>-o</b> Verbose mode: shows progress (prints a dot for each file  scanned,  a  comma  for  each  file  fix
           iteration/file.)

       ○   <b>-d</b> Debug mode: shows all steps of the core logic.

       By  default  only a subset of rules is enabled (around 100). You can enable more rules with the following
       options:

       ○   <b>-u</b> Enable less safe rules. (Manual review's importance is more significant...) (Around ten rules.)

       ○   <b>-g</b> Enable rules to convert British English to US English.  (These  rules  aren't  exactly  typos  but
           sometimes they can be useful.) (Around ten rules.)

       ○   <b>-R</b> Enable rare rules. (Few hundred rules.)

       ○   <b>-V</b> Enable very rare rules. (Mostly from the wikipedia article.) (More than four thousand rules.)

       ○   <b>-D</b> Enable rules based on lintian.debian.org ( git:ebac9a7, ~2300 )

       The  processing  speed  decreases  as  you  activate  more  rules. But with newer greps this is much less
       significant.

       File filtering options:

       ○   <b>-G</b> Respect <b>.gitignore</b> files. (Requires executable <b>git</b> command.) (experimental)

       ○   <b>-N</b> Enable file name filtering. For example: <b>-N</b> <b>'*.cpp'</b> <b>-N</b> <b>'*.h'</b>

       ○   <b>-i</b> Walk through source code management system's internal directories. (do not ignore <b>.git</b>, <b>.svn</b>, <b>.hg</b>,
           <b>CVS</b>)

       ○   <b>-b</b> Process binary, generated files. (do not ignore <b>*.gif</b>, <b>*.jpg</b>, <b>*.jpeg</b>, <b>*.png</b>, <b>*.zip</b>, <b>*.svg</b>, <b>*.tiff</b>,
           <b>*.gz</b>, <b>*.bz2</b>, <b>*.xz</b>, <b>*.rar</b>, <b>*.po</b>, <b>*.pdf</b>, <b>*.woff</b>,  <b>yarn.lock</b>,  <b>package-lock.json</b>,  <b>composer.lock</b>,  <b>*.mo</b>,
           <b>*.mov</b>, <b>*.mp4</b>, <b>*.jar</b>)

       ○   <b>-m</b> Disable file size checks. Default is to ignore files &gt; 1MB. (usually csv, compressed JS, ..)

       Whitelisting files/entries:

       Misspell-fixer automatically ignores the issues matching to the patterns listed in <b>.misspell-fixer.ignore</b>
       or  <b>.github/.misspell-fixer.ignore</b>.  The  format of this file follows the prefiltering's temporary result
       format:

       <b>^filename:line</b> <b>number:matched</b> <b>word</b>

       ○   <b>-W</b> can be used to append the found issues instead of fixing them based on the other settings.

       ○   <b>-w</b> <b>filename</b> can be used to override the ignore file's name.

       The ignore file is interpreted as a <b>grep</b> exclusion list. It is applied after the prefiltering step  as  a
       set  of grep expressions. So it is possible to exclude any prefixes or more specifically whole files with
       keeping only their file names:

       <b>^filename</b>

       Or a directory:

       <b>^directory</b>

       The entries are listed/matched with the paths based on the current invocation. Reaching the  same  target
       with  a  different  path from the same working directory will not apply the whitelisted entries generated
       from the other invocation. In directory <b>x</b> the whitelist entries generated  with  target  <b>.</b>  will  not  be
       applied for target <b>../x</b>, although they are the same. There is a workaround for this with manually editing
       the whitelist to your needs. (Patches are welcome...)

   <b>Return</b> <b>values</b>
       Generally, the script tries to return with <b>0</b> if there were no typos or errors found/fixed.

       ○   <b>0</b> No typos found,

       ○   <b>1-5</b> Typos found. The return value shows the number of iterations executed.

       ○   <b>10</b> Help successfully printed.

       ○   <b>11</b> Whitelist successfully saved.

       ○   <b>100-</b> Parameter errors. (invalid, missing, conflicting)

   <b>Sample</b> <b>usage</b>
       Without arguments, the script will not change anything and its output is minimal. Its return value can be
       used to detect whether it found any typos or not.

           $ misspell-fixer target

       Fixing the files with displaying each fixed file:

           $ misspell-fixer -rv target

       Showing only the diffs without modifying the originals:

           $ misspell-fixer -sv target

       Showing the diffs with progress and fixing the found typos:

           $ misspell-fixer -rsv target

       Fast mode example, no backups: (highest performance)

           $ misspell-fixer -frn target

       The previous with all rules enabled:

           $ misspell-fixer -frunRVD target

   <b>With</b> <b>Docker</b>
       In  some  environments  the dependencies may cause some trouble. (Mac, Windows, older linux versions.) In
       this case, you can use misspell-fixer as a docker container image.

       Pull the latest version:

           $ docker pull vlajos/misspell-fixer

       And fix <b>targetdir</b>'s content:

           $ docker run -ti --rm -v targetdir:/work vlajos/misspell-fixer -frunRVD .

       General execution directly with docker:

           $ docker run -ti --rm -v targetdir:/work vlajos/misspell-fixer [arguments]

       <b>targetdir</b> becomes the current working directory in the container, so you can reference it  as  <b>.</b>  in  the
       arguments list.

       You can also use the <b>dockered-fixer</b> wrapper from the source repository:

           $ dockered-fixer [arguments]

       In case your shell supports functions, you can define a function to make the command a little shorter:

           $ function misspell-fixer { docker run -ti --rm -v $(pwd):/work vlajos/misspell-fixer "$@"; }

       And fixing with the function:

           $ misspell-fixer [arguments]

       Through  the wrapper and the function, it can access only the folders below the current working directory
       as it is the only one passed to the container as a volume.

       You can build the container locally, although this should not be really needed:

           $ docker build . -t misspell-fixer

   <b>With</b> <b>GitHub</b> <b>Actions</b>
       There's a GitHub Action <u>https://github.com/sobolevn/misspell-fixer-action</u> to run <b>misspell-fixer</b> as  well.
       It can even send PRs automatically with the fixes.

   <b>Dependencies</b> <b>-</b>
       The  script  itself  is just a misspelling database and some glue in <b>bash</b> between <b>grep</b> and <b>sed</b>. <b>grep</b>'s <b>-F</b>
       combined with <b>sed</b>'s line targeting makes the script quite efficient. <b>-F</b> enables parallel pattern matching
       with   the   Aho–Corasick   algorithm   <u>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho%E2%80%93Corasick_algorithm</u>    .
       Unfortunately only the newer (2.28+) versions of grep supports <b>-w</b> properly.

       A little more comprehensive list:

       ○   bash

       ○   find

       ○   sed

       ○   grep

       ○   diff

       ○   sort

       ○   tee

       ○   cut

       ○   rm, cp, mv

       ○   xargs

       ○   git (for respecting .gitignore files)

       ○   ugrep (for significant speed up, optional)
