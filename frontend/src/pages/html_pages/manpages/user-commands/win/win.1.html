</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       win - Terminal emulator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>win</b> [<b>-v</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>name</u><b>]</b> [<u>command</u> [<u>argument</u> <u>...</u>]]  <u>address</u>

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-v</b>     If the <b>-v</b> option is present, <u>win</u> prints its version number and date and exits.

       <b>-t</b><u>name</u> If the <b>-t</b> option is present, win uses <u>+name</u> as the final part of the tag name of its window.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>win</u>  must  be  able  to  connect  to  a  running <u><a href="../man1/wily.1.html">wily</a></u>(1).  <u>win</u> attaches to a window.  If the <b>-t</b> option is
       present, the final part of the tag name is <u>name</u>.  If <u>command</u> is present, the final part of the  tag  name
       is  <u>+command</u>.   Otherwise, the final part of the tag name is <u>+win</u>.  The first part of the tag name is the
       current working directory.

       win runs a program in a child process.  The child process is  the  leader  of  a  process  group  and  is
       connected to <u>win</u> by a pseudo-terminal.  If <u>command</u> is specified, the child process runs

              $SHELL -c 'command argument ...'
              otherwise it runs

              $SHELL -i
              If SHELL is not found in the environment, <u><a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a></u> is used.

       TERM=win is placed in the environment of the running program.

       Output  from the running command appears in the window.  The point after the last output from the running
       command is known as the output point.  Further output from the running command appears  just  before  the
       output point.  The output point is initially at the end of the window.

       Normal  wily  editing  commands  work in the window.  When a newline, interrupt character, or end-of-file
       character is created after the output point, the text between the output  point  and  the  last  newline,
       interrupt  character, or end-of-file character in the window (inclusive) is passed to the running program
       as input.

       The interrupt character is control-C and the end-of-file character  is  control-D.   The  pseudo-terminal
       initially is configured so that these are recognized with their normal meanings.

       The B2 commands beginning with the |, &lt;, or &gt; characters or an upper case letter are executed normally by
       wily.   Other  B2  are first terminated with a newline, if they are not already, and are then appended to
       the buffer (and thereafter passed to the running program).

</pre><h4><b>RETURNS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>win</u> returns zero if it is able to successfully create the child process, otherwise it returns non-zero.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Run a terminal emulator within wily

              win

       Run FTP within wily

              win ftp

       Run rlogin within wily

              win -t host.domain rlogin -8 host.domain

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>win</u> doesn't follow changes to the terminal attributes.  In particular, there is no way to stop echoing or
       to change its concept of the interrupt and eof characters.

       <u>rlogin</u> seems to need -8 and, annoyingly, sets echo and onlcr.  The latter can be fixed in your .rcrc:

              if ( ~ $TERM win ) {
                  stty -echo -onlcr
              }

       <u>win</u> doesn't follow changes to the terminal attributes.  In particular, there is no way to stop echoing or
       to change its concept of the interrupt and eof characters.

       WEdestroy messages aren't yet passed by wily.  Thus, Del and Delcol can delete the window yet  leave  win
       running.

       There  is  a  race  condition; the user can press newline and then delete text before win has a chance to
       read it.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       <u>win</u> was originally written by Gary Capell (<a href="mailto:gary@cs.su.oz.au">gary@cs.su.oz.au</a>).  Alan Watson  (<a href="mailto:alan@oldp.nmsu.edu">alan@oldp.nmsu.edu</a>)  rewrote
       it  and  added  support  for  arguments,  pseudo-terminals  instead of pipes, and execution of certain B2
       commands by wily.  The pseudo-terminal support in 9term, written by Matty Farrow (<a href="mailto:matty@cs.su.oz.au">matty@cs.su.oz.au</a>), was
       a great help.
