</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
        wp2x - A WordPerfect 5.0 to whatever converter

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wp2x</b> [ <b>-s</b> ] [ <b>-v</b> ] [ <b>-n</b><u>blip</u> ] configfile wpfile

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Wp2x</u>  is  intended  to  convert  <u>simple</u>  files  stored  in WordPerfect 5.1 format into any other document
       processing language that uses plain text files.  Examples include TeX, LaTeX, troff, GML and HTML.  For a
       quick result without manual configuration you can try the following command to convert  a  WP  file  into
       HTML: <u>wp2x</u> <u>html</u> <u>foo.wp</u> <u>&gt;</u> <u>foo.html.</u>

       <u>Wp2x</u>  reads  a  configuration  file and a WordPerfect 5.1 input file, and uses the information in them to
       produce an output file, which is sent to stdout.  If the configuration file cannot be found, a suffix  of
       <u>.cfg</u>  is  appended.   The  current  directory  is searched, as well as the lib directory specified by the
       <u>WP2X_DIR</u> variable in the Makefile. (Usually <u>/usr/local/lib/wp2x</u> ) and the directories  specified  by  the
       environment variables <u>PATH</u> <u>,</u> <u>DPATH</u> <u>,</u> and <u>WP2XLIB</u> <u>.</u>

       Some  codes  are  not  translated  because  documents  that  require  these codes typically would require
       significant hand-editing.  Hence, there's no point in trying to emulate something you're going to  delete
       anyway.   (Remember,  <u>wp2x</u>  is not intended to be used as an automated conversion program.  Rather, it is
       intended to be used as a single step in the document conversion process, which gets most of the the grunt
       work of conversion done and out of the way, so that you can concentrate your efforts  on  converting  the
       trickier  parts of the document.  The object of the game is to produce a readable conversion, rather than
       a perfect conversion.)

       As the program runs, a dot is printed to <u>stderr</u>  for  every  1024  characters  converted.   This  can  be
       suppressed with the <b>-s</b> switch, and the interval between dots can be changed with the <b>-n</b> switch.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-s</b>     Suppresses  all  non-error  output to <u>stderr</u>, including the <u>typeout</u> banner, the progress dots, and
              warnings about undefined expansions.

       <b>-n</b><u>blip</u> Every <u>blip</u> tokens, a dot is emitted to <u>stderr</u>, unless the <b>-s</b> switch is given.  The value <u>blip</u> must
              appear immediately following the <b>-n</b> without an intervening space.  If no <b>-n</b>  switch  is  supplied,
              then a value of 1024 is assumed.

       <b>-v</b>     prints the version number and the program usage.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The  configuration file controls how the file is converted from WordPerfect 5.1 format.  Each line of the
       configuration file is of the form

                                              identifier="list of codes"

       where the list of codes is a string which will be placed in the output stream whenever the  corresponding
       WordPerfect  code is encountered.  Standard C-style backslash-escape sequences are recognized, as well as
       \xFF for hex values.   You  do  not  have  to  backslash-protect  a  newline.   Some  identifiers  supply
       replaceable parameters, which can be interpolated as follows:

       %1     interpolate first parameter as a decimal integer.

       %2     interpolate second parameter as a decimal integer.

       %c     interpolate first parameter as an ASCII character.

       %\n    interpolate  a  newline  if the most-recently-output character was not already a newline.  (The <u>\n</u>
              can be either the C-style escape sequence, or an actual  newline  character.)   Use  this  if  the
              expansion must take place at the beginning of a line.  (For example, <u>troff</u> control characters must
              appear  as  the first character in the line in order to take effect.)  This sequence is meaningful
              only at the beginning of the string; if it appears elsewhere, it is flagged as erroneous.

       %%     interpolate a percent-sign.

       A percent sign followed by any other  character  is  considered  an  error.   It  is  also  an  error  to
       interpolate  a parameter that is not applicable to the identifier being defined.  You may interpolate the
       parameters as many times as, and in whatever order, you wish.  (With the exception of the <u>%\n</u> code.)

       Here follows a list of the accepted identifiers.  In the discussion, `%1' represents the first parameter,
       and `%2' the second.  Remember that the character version of %1 is available as `%c'.

       BEGIN          Expanded at the beginning of the file.
       END            Expanded at the end of the file.
       COMMENT        Expanded when wp2x needs to insert a comment into the output.  The comment  is  passed  as
                      %s.

       PageNo         Insert current page number
       RomanPage      Set page number to %1, and set roman-numeral mode
       ArabicPage     Set page number to %1, and set arabic-numeral mode

       Tab            What to do when you see a tab character.
       BeginTabs      Emitted  when  tab  settings  are  about  to change.  The <b>BeginTabs</b> code should delete all
                      existing tabs and prepare for new tab settings to start.  All  tab  values  are  given  in
                      columns measured from the physical left edge of the paper.  (Not from the left margin.)
       SetTab         Set a normal (left-justified) tabstop at column %1.
       SetTabCenter   Set a centered tabstop at column %1.
       SetTabRight    Set a right-justified tabstop at column %1.
       SetTabDecimal  Set a decimal tab at column %1.
       EndTabs        Finish the setting of tabstops.

       For example, if the WordPerfect file contains a code that says `Set new tabstops as follows:  Regular tab
       at  column  15,  a  centered  tab  at column 40, a right-justified tab at column 59, and a regular tab at
       column 60', then the following expansions are made in succession:

           BeginTabs
           <a href="../man15/SetTab.15.html">SetTab</a>(15)
           <a href="../man40/SetTabCenter.40.html">SetTabCenter</a>(40)
           <a href="../man59/SetTabright.59.html">SetTabright</a>(59)
           <a href="../man60/SetTab.60.html">SetTab</a>(60)
           EndTabs

       HSpace Hard (nonbreakable) space.
       HPg    Hard page break.
       CondEOP
              Force a new page if fewer than %1 half-lines remain on current page.

       -      Breakable hyphen.
       --     Breakable hyphen, appearing at the end of a line.
       =      Non-breakable hyphen.
       \-     Discretionary hyphen.
       \--    Discretionary hyphen, appearing at the end of a line.

       Marg   Set left margin at %1 characters and right margin at %2 characters.
       TopMargin
              Set top margin to %1 lines.
       PageLength
              Set page length to %1 lines.

       SS     Single spacing.
       DS     Double spacing.
       1.5S   One-and-a-half spacing.
       TS     Triple spacing.
       LS     Other line spacing.  %1 is twice the desired spacing.  (For example,  a  request  for  2.5-spacing
              sets %1=5.)
       LPI    Set %1 lines per inch (%1 is either 6 or 8)

       Header Begin header text
       header End header text
       Footer Begin footer text
       footer End footer text

       Supp   Suppress  page  number/header/footer  information  for one page.  %1 argument is a bit field which
              describes what sort of suppression is desired.  Here's what the bits mean:
                        1 = all
                        2 = page number
                        4 = page numbers moved to bottom
                        8 = all headers
                       16 = header a
                       32 = header b
                       64 = footer a
                      128 = footer b
       CtrPg  Center page vertically

       SetFont
              Change pitch or font.  %1 is the desired pitch.  (Negative means  proportionally-spaced.)   %2  is
              the font number.
       SetBin Select paper bin to %1 = 0, 1, ...

       PN0    No page numbering.
       PN1    Page number in top left.
       PN2    Page number in top center.
       PN3    Page number in top right.
       PN4    Page number on top outside corners (even/odd).
       PN5    Page number in lower left.
       PN6    Page number in bottom center.
       PN7    Page number in lower right.
       PN8    Page number on bottom outside corners (even/odd).

       If  no  expansion is supplied for an identifier, then nothing is emitted to <u>stdout</u>, but a warning message
       is sent to <u>stderr</u>.  This warning message will  appear  at  most  once  per  identifier,  and  it  can  be
       suppressed completely by the <b>-s</b> option.

       The  special  identifier <u>typeout</u> causes its replacement text to be displayed on the screen every time the
       configuration file is read.  This is useful for identification messages, or reminders to the user.

       A special identifier is any character enclosed in single quotation  marks,  which  represent  themselves.
       For example,

          'α'="{\\alpha}"

       causes  the  string "{\alpha}" to be emitted when an α is encountered.  This could also have been written
       as

          '\xE0'="{\\alpha}"

       if the character α has ASCII value 0xE0.  (Which is true for the IBM PC encoding.)

       If no definition exists for a particular special character, it is transmitted undisturbed.  If a  special
       character  is  encountered  from  the upper half of the ASCII character set, and if it has no definition,
       then a warning message is also emitted.  (Which can be suppressed with the <b>-s</b> option.)

       Lines beginning with the # character are comments.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       This is based on an original WP 4.2 to anything translator. The file format has changed a lot between 4.2
       and 5.0. This translator no longer reads WP 4.2 files, although it could be extended to do so.

       The 5.0+ format starts with a standard header file. There is a four byte magic number at the head of  the
       file, followed by various product and version information. All WordPerfect Corporation utilities use this
       standard header. See the WPproducts array in <u>wp2x.c</u>

       Once the contents of the file have been located, there are three kinds of codes: simple one byte controls
       (WP  4.2  had  only  these kinds), fixed length controls, and variable length controls. There are a large
       number of undefined types defined for future use. If <b>wp2x</b> detects something it doesn't understand, it can
       extract the length and skip that code. There are a number of defined codes that are unimplemented. Please
       see the code, specifically <u>tokens.c</u> where much of the input processing is done.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The sample configuration files in <u>/usr/local/lib/wp2x</u> give you some  sort  of  idea  what  a  `production
       quality'  configuration  file  might  look  like.  They are not intended to be used as-is, but rather are
       meant to be modified to suit your particular needs.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Ignoring byte [XX]
              Indicates that an unimplemented single byte code was ignored.

       Ignoring fixed [XX]
              Indicates that an unimplemented fixed length code was ignored.

       Ignoring variable [XX] sub [XX] length
              Indicates that an unimplemented variable length code was ignored, and gives its length.

       Warning: Expected XX but received XX at pos: YYYY
              something is wrong in the input file at byte YYYY.

       Warning: No expansion for XX (C)
              A WP code for which no expansion was defined in the config file was encountered.

       Internal error: Invalid escape C
              An error occurred while processing an expansion escape (%x substitution). Probably it  was  not  a
              recognized escape, check the config file.

       Fixed Length block [XX] incorrectly terminated by [YY] as pos Z
              Something is wrong with the input file, a fixed length block was screwed up.

       Reserved code [XX] seen
              Something that WPC defined as reserved was seen. Check with WPC for new meaning.

       Not a recognized file type. The file did not start with the right WPC
              magic number. Maybe this is a 4.2 file, or not a WordPerfect file at all?

       Error: Cannot open X (reason)
              The file X could not be opened, for the indicated reason.

       Error: Expecting a hex digit
              Inside a string, you typed the characters `\x', but the next character was not a valid hex digit.

       Error: string pool overflow
              The configuration file contained too many strings.  Increase the value of POOL_SIZE and recompile.

       Error: Unknown identifier X
              The  word  X  was encountered in the configuration file when <u>wp2x</u> expected a token identifier like
              `HRt'.  Most likely, you either misspelled it, or you got your quotation marks out of sync.

       Error: Identifier not followed by = sign
              After an identifier must come an equals-sign.

       Error: Quotation mark expected
              After the equals-sign must come a quotation mark.

       Error: X: `%\n' not at start of expansion
              The expansion for the identifier X contained the indicated sequence of characters somewhere  other
              than  the  beginning  of  the  string.   The  `%\n'  interpolation  code is meaningful only at the
              beginning of a string.

       Error: X: invalid escape `%x'
              The expansion for the identifier X contained an invalid escape.  Either you  used  `%1',  `%2'  or
              `%c' when the identifier X does not supply that parameter, or you meant for a genuine percent sign
              to be output, in which case you should put `%%' in the expansion.

       Error: Invalid character identifier
              Character identifiers can only be one character long (after backslash interpretation).

       Warning: Expected XX but received YY.
              The  program  expected  the  next  byte from the WP file to be XX, but the byte YY was encountered
              instead.  This means either that your WP file  is  damaged,  or  that  the  program  is  seriously
              confused.  (Or both.)  The program will pretend that the byte in the file was indeed XX, which may
              lead to synchronization errors later on.

       Warning: No expansion for X
              The  WP  file contained the token X, but the configuration file did not contain any expansion text
              for it.  A null expansion was assumed.

       Warning: No expansion for XX (c)
              The WP file contained the character c (hex code XX), but the configuration file  did  not  contain
              any  expansion  text for it.  The character was emitted unaltered.  Beware that this may give your
              text formatter indigestion if it does not handle eight-bit characters.

       Warning: X code not supported
              The file being converted uses a code which <u>wp2x</u> does not know how to convert.  A comment is placed
              in the output file in its place.   If  you  ever  encounter  a  `WPCorp  reserved'  or  a  `WPCorp
              undefined' code, the author would appreciate hearing from you.

       Internal error:  Invalid escape, %x
              While  processing  text,  <u>wp2x</u> noticed that you used an invalid escape.  Nothing is emitted as the
              escape text.  (The internal-ness is that this error is supposed to  be  caught  at  the  time  the
              configuration file is read.)

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Naive configuration files will fail if your WP file doesn't nest its tags properly.  A typical case is

            [Center][B]Hello[center]
            [Center]There[b][center]
       to produce a centered boldface `Hello'.  If you use the naive encoding of

            Center="\\centerline{"
            center="}\n"
            Bold="{\\bf "
            bold="}"

       then this will expand to

            \centerline{{\bf Hello}
            \centerline{There}}

       WordPerfect  has no clean concept of grouping; it lets you change fonts at any time and let those changes
       propagate outside the current environment.  (With the  exception  of  headers,  footers,  footnotes,  and
       endnotes.)

       Now  sure,  you  could write complicated configuration strings to try to handle this `properly', but it'd
       probably not be worth the trouble.  After all, the purpose is not to perform a  perfect  conversion,  but
       rather  to  produce  a  <u>readable</u>  conversion,  which  can  then  be massaged by hand to produce a perfect
       manuscript.

       Another potential problem is combined attributes, like boldface underline.  Under a naive configuration,

            [B]Boldface [U]Underlined boldface[b] Underlined[u] normal.

       comes out as

        {\bf Boldface {\it Underlined boldface} Underlined\/} normal.

       which is wrong for two reasons.  One is the nesting problem discussed above.  The other is that TeX  font
       attributes do not combine.

       Similar problems exist for other document preparation systems.  So be careful.
