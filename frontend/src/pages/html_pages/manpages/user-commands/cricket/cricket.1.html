</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cricket - A program to manage the collection and display of time-series data

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cricket-compile</b>
       <b>/usr/share/cricket/collector</b>
       <b>/usr/lib/cgi-bin/cricket/grapher.cgi</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the programs associated with Cricket.

       <b>cricket-compile</b>
              The  <b>cricket-compile</b>  program  compiles  the  Cricket config tree (found in <u>/etc/cricket</u>) into the
              format read by the collector. It is normally run after editing the files in the  config  tree.  No
              options are needed.

       <b>collector</b>
              The  <b>collector</b>  program  reads a Cricket configuration from <u>/etc/cricket</u>, compiled by the <b>cricket-</b>
              <b>compile</b> command, and collects and stores data according to the information  found  there.   It  is
              normally run periodically from a <b><a href="../man8/cron.8.html">cron</a></b>(8) job.

       <b>grapher.cgi</b>
              <b>grapher.cgi</b> is a CGI program to display the data collected by Cricket in a graphical format. It is
              usually   accessed   using   a   web   browser,   e.g.   using   the   URL   <a href="http://localhost/cgi">http://localhost/cgi</a>-
              bin/cricket/grapher.cgi.  It will allow you to navigate around all of the targets  in  the  config
              tree.

       This  manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not
       have a manual page.  Instead, it has documentation in the HTML format; see below.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       The programs are documented fully by various HTML documents available via the help system, or directly in
       /usr/share/doc/cricket.
