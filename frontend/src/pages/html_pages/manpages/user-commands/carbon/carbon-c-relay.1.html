</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>carbon-c-relay</b> - graphite relay, aggregator and rewriter

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>carbon-c-relay</b> <b>-f</b> <u>config-file</u> <b>[</b> <b>options</b> ... <b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>carbon-c-relay</b>  accepts,  cleanses,  matches,  rewrites,  forwards  and  aggregates  graphite  metrics by
       listening  for  incoming  connections  and  relaying  the  messages  to  other  servers  defined  in  its
       configuration.  The  core  functionality  is  to  route  messages  via  flexible  rules  to  the  desired
       destinations.

       <b>carbon-c-relay</b> is a simple program that reads its routing information  from  a  file.  The  command  line
       arguments  allow to set the location for this file, as well as the amount of dispatchers (worker threads)
       to use for reading the data from incoming connections and passing them onto the right destination(s). The
       route file supports two main constructs: clusters and matches. The first  define  groups  of  hosts  data
       metrics  can  be  sent  to,  the latter define which metrics should be sent to which cluster. Aggregation
       rules are seen as matches. Rewrites are actions that directly affect the metric at  the  point  in  which
       they appear in the configuration.

       For  every  metric  received  by  the  relay, cleansing is performed. The following changes are performed
       before any match, aggregate or rewrite rule sees the metric:

       •   double dot elimination (necessary for correctly functioning consistent hash routing)

       •   trailing/leading dot elimination

       •   whitespace normalisation (this mostly affects output of the relay to other targets: metric, value and
           timestamp will be separated by a single space only, ever)

       •   irregular char replacement with underscores (_), currently irregular  is  defined  as  not  being  in
           <b>[0-9a-zA-Z-_:#]</b>, but can be overridden on the command line. Note that tags (when present and allowed)
           are not processed this way.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These options control the behaviour of <b>carbon-c-relay</b>.

       •   <b>-v</b>: Print version string and exit.

       •   <b>-d</b>:  Enable  debug  mode,  this  prints  statistics  to  stdout  and prints extra messages about some
           situations encountered by the relay that normally would be too verbose to be enabled.  When  combined
           with <b>-t</b> (test mode) this also prints stub routes and consistent-hash ring contents.

       •   <b>-s</b>:  Enable  submission  mode.  In  this  mode, internal statistics are not generated. Instead, queue
           pressure and metrics drops are reported on stdout. This mode is useful when used as submission  relay
           which´  job  is  just to forward to (a set of) main relays. Statistics about the submission relays in
           this case are not needed, and could easily cause a non-desired flood of metrics  e.g.  when  used  on
           each and every host locally.

       •   <b>-t</b>: Test mode. This mode doesn´t do any routing at all, but instead reads input from stdin and prints
           what  actions  would  be  taken  given the loaded configuration. This mode is very useful for testing
           relay routes for regular expression syntax etc. It also allows to give  insight  on  how  routing  is
           applied in complex configurations, for it shows rewrites and aggregates taking place as well. When <b>-t</b>
           is repeated, the relay will only test the configuration for validity and exit immediately afterwards.
           Any  standard  output  is  suppressed in this mode, making it ideal for start-scripts to test a (new)
           configuration.

       •   <b>-f</b> <u>config-file</u>: Read configuration from <u>config-file</u>. A configuration consists of clusters and routes.
           See <u>CONFIGURATION</u> <u>SYNTAX</u> for more information on the options and syntax of this file.

       •   <b>-l</b> <u>log-file</u>: Use <u>log-file</u> for writing messages. Without this option, the relay writes both to  <u>stdout</u>
           and  <u>stderr</u>.  When logging to file, all messages are prefixed with <b>MSG</b> when they were sent to <u>stdout</u>,
           and <b>ERR</b> when they were sent to <u>stderr</u>.

       •   <b>-p</b> <u>port</u>: Listen for connections on port <u>port</u>. The port number is used for  both  <b>TCP</b>,  <b>UDP</b>  and  <b>UNIX</b>
           <b>sockets</b>.  In  the  latter  case, the socket file contains the port number. The port defaults to <u>2003</u>,
           which is also used by the original <b>carbon-cache.py</b>. Note that this only applies to the defaults, when
           <b>listen</b> directives are in the config, this setting is ignored.

       •   <b>-w</b> <u>workers</u>: Use <u>workers</u> number of threads. The default number of workers is equal to  the  amount  of
           detected  CPU  cores. It makes sense to reduce this number on many-core machines, or when the traffic
           is low.

       •   <b>-b</b> <u>batchsize</u>: Set the amount of metrics that sent to remote servers at once to  <u>batchsize</u>.  When  the
           relay  sends metrics to servers, it will retrieve <b>batchsize</b> metrics from the pending queue of metrics
           waiting for that server and send those one by one. The size of the batch will have minimal impact  on
           sending performance, but it controls the amount of lock-contention on the queue. The default is <u>2500</u>.

       •   <b>-q</b>  <u>queuesize</u>:  Each  server from the configuration where the relay will send metrics to, has a queue
           associated with it. This queue allows for disruptions and bursts to be  handled.  The  size  of  this
           queue  will  be  set  to  <u>queuesize</u> which allows for that amount of metrics to be stored in the queue
           before it overflows, and the relay starts dropping metrics. The larger the queue, more metrics can be
           absorbed, but also more memory will be used by the relay. The default queue size is <u>25000</u>.

       •   <b>-L</b> <u>stalls</u>: Sets the max mount of stalls to <u>stalls</u> before the relay  starts  dropping  metrics  for  a
           server.  When  a  queue  fills  up,  the  relay uses a mechanism called stalling to signal the client
           (writing to the relay) of this event. In particular when the client sends a large amount  of  metrics
           in  very short time (burst), stalling can help to avoid dropping metrics, since the client just needs
           to slow down for a bit, which in many cases is possible  (e.g.  when  catting  a  file  with  <b><a href="../man1/nc.1.html">nc</a></b>(1)).
           However,  this  behaviour  can  also  obstruct,  artificially stalling writers which cannot stop that
           easily. For this the stalls can be set from <u>0</u> to <u>15</u>, where each stall can take around 1 second on the
           client. The default value is set to <u>4</u>, which is aimed at the occasional disruption scenario  and  max
           effort to not loose metrics with moderate slowing down of clients.

       •   <b>-C</b>  <u>CAcertpath</u>:  Read  CA  certs (for use with TLS/SSL connections) from given path or file. When not
           given, the default locations are used. Strict verfication of the peer is  performed,  so  when  using
           self-signed certificates, be sure to include the CA cert in the default location, or provide the path
           to the cert using this option.

       •   <b>-T</b>  <u>timeout</u>: Specifies the IO timeout in milliseconds used for server connections. The default is <u>600</u>
           milliseconds, but may need increasing when WAN links are used for target servers.  A  relatively  low
           value  for  connection  timeout allows the relay to quickly establish a server is unreachable, and as
           such failover strategies to kick in before the queue runs high.

       •   <b>-c</b> <u>chars</u>: Defines the characters that are next to  <b>[A-Za-z0-9]</b>  allowed  in  metrics  to  <u>chars</u>.  Any
           character not in this list, is replaced by the relay with <b>_</b> (underscore). The default list of allowed
           characters is <u>-_:#</u>.

       •   <b>-m</b>  <u>length</u>:  Limits  the metric names to be of at most <u>length</u> bytes long. Any lines containing metric
           names larger than this will be discarded.

       •   <b>-M</b> <u>length</u> Limits the input to lines of at most <u>length</u> bytes. Any excess lines will be discarded. Note
           that <b>-m</b> needs to be smaller than this value.

       •   <b>-H</b> <u>hostname</u>: Override hostname determined by a call to <b><a href="../man3/gethostname.3.html">gethostname</a></b>(3) with <u>hostname</u>. The hostname  is
           used mainly in the statistics metrics <b>carbon.relays.&lt;hostname&gt;.&lt;...&gt;</b> sent by the relay.

       •   <b>-B</b> <u>backlog</u>: Sets TCP connection listen backlog to <u>backlog</u> connections. The default value is <u>32</u> but on
           servers which receive many concurrent connections, this setting likely needs to be increased to avoid
           connection refused errors on the clients.

       •   <b>-U</b>  <u>bufsize</u>: Sets the socket send/receive buffer sizes in bytes, for both TCP and UDP scenarios. When
           unset, the OS default is used. The maximum is also determined by the OS.  The  sizes  are  set  using
           setsockopt  with  the  flags  SO_RCVBUF  and  SO_SNDBUF. Setting this size may be necessary for large
           volume scenarios, for which also <b>-B</b> might apply. Checking the <u>Recv-Q</u> and the  <u>receive</u>  <u>errors</u>  values
           from <u>netstat</u> gives a good hint about buffer usage.

       •   <b>-E</b>:  Disable  disconnecting  idle  incoming connections. By default the relay disconnects idle client
           connections after 10 minutes. It does this  to  prevent  resources  clogging  up  when  a  faulty  or
           malicious client keeps on opening connections without closing them. It typically prevents running out
           of  file  descriptors.  For  some  scenarios, however, it is not desirable for idle connections to be
           disconnected, hence passing this flag will disable this behaviour.

       •   <b>-D</b>: Deamonise into the background after startup. This option requires <b>-l</b> and <b>-P</b> flags to  be  set  as
           well.

       •   <b>-P</b> <u>pidfile</u>: Write the pid of the relay process to a file called <u>pidfile</u>. This is in particular useful
           when daemonised in combination with init managers.

       •   <b>-O</b>  <u>threshold</u>: The minimum number of rules to find before trying to optimise the ruleset. The default
           is <b>50</b>, to disable the optimiser, use <b>-1</b>, to always run the optimiser use <b>0</b>. The  optimiser  tries  to
           group rules to avoid spending excessive time on matching expressions.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       The  config file supports the following syntax, where comments start with a <b>#</b> character and can appear at
       any position on a line and suppress input until the end of that line:

               ;

           include &lt;/path/to/file/or/glob&gt;
               ;

   <b>CLUSTERS</b>
       Multiple clusters can be defined, and need not to be referenced by a match rule. All  clusters  point  to
       one  or more hosts, except the <b>file</b> cluster which writes to files in the local filesystem. <b>host</b> may be an
       IPv4 or IPv6 address, or a hostname. Since host is followed by an optional <b>:</b> and port, for IPv6 addresses
       not to be interpreted wrongly, either a port must be given, or the IPv6 address surrounded  by  brackets,
       e.g.  <b>[::1]</b>.  Optional <b>transport</b> and <b>proto</b> clauses can be used to wrap the connection in a compression or
       encryption later or specify the use of UDP or TCP to connect to  the  remote  server.  When  omitted  the
       connection defaults to an unwrapped TCP connection. <b>type</b> can only be linemode at the moment.

       DNS  hostnames  are  resolved  to  a  single  address,  according  to  the  preference  rules in RFC 3484
       <u>https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3484.txt</u>. The <b>any_of</b>, <b>failover</b> and <b>forward</b> clusters have an  explicit  <b>useall</b>
       flag that enables expansion for hostnames resolving to multiple addresses. Using this option Each address
       returned becomes a cluster destination.

       There are two groups of cluster types, simple forwarding clusters and consistent hashing clusters.

       •   <b>forward</b> and <b>file</b> clusters

           The  <b>forward</b>  and  <b>file</b>  clusters  simply  send  everything they receive to the defined members (host
           addresses or files). When a cluster has multiple members, all incoming  metrics  are  sent  to  /all/
           members, basically duplicating the input metric stream over all members.

       •   <b>any_of</b> cluster

           The  <b>any_of</b>  cluster  is  a  small  variant  of the <b>forward</b> cluster, but instead of sending the input
           metrics to all defined members, it sends each incoming metric to only one  of  defined  members.  The
           purpose  of  this  is  a  load-balanced  scenario where any of the members can receive any metric. As
           <b>any_of</b> suggests, when any of the members become unreachable, the  remaining  available  members  will
           immediately  receive the full input stream of metrics. This specifically mean that when 4 members are
           used, each will receive approximately 25% of the input metrics. When one member  becomes  unavailable
           (e.g.  network  interruption, or a restart of the service), the remaining 3 members will each receive
           about 33% of the input. When designing cluster capacity, one should take into  account  that  in  the
           most extreme case, the final remaining member will receive all input traffic.

           An <b>any_of</b> cluster can in particular be useful when the cluster points to other relays or caches. When
           used  with  other relays, it effectively load-balances, and adapts immediately over inavailability of
           targets. When used with caches, the  behaviour  of  the  <b>any_of</b>  router  to  send  the  same  metrics
           consistently  to  the  same destination helps caches to have a high hitrate on their internal buffers
           for the same metrics (if they use them), but still allows for a rolling-restart of  the  caches  when
           e.g. on the same machine.

       •   <b>failover</b> cluster

           The  <b>failover</b>  cluster  is  like  the  <b>any_of</b>  cluster,  but sticks to the order in which servers are
           defined. This is to implement a pure failover scenario between servers. All metrics are  sent  to  at
           most  1  member, so no hashing or balancing is taking place. A <b>failover</b> cluster with two members will
           only send metrics to the second member if the first becomes unavailable.

       •   <b>carbon_ch</b> cluster

           The <b>carbon_ch</b> cluster sends the metrics to the member that is responsible according to the consistent
           hash algorithm, as used in the original carbon python relay, or multiple members  if  replication  is
           set  to  more  than  1. When <b>dynamic</b> is set, failure of any of the servers does not result in metrics
           being dropped for that server, but instead the undeliverable metrics are sent to any other server  in
           the cluster in order for the metrics not to get lost. This is most useful when replication is 1.

           The  calculation  of the hashring, that defines the way in which metrics are distributed, is based on
           the server host (or IP address) and the optional instance  of  the  member.  This  means  that  using
           <b>carbon_ch</b>  two  targets  on  different ports but on the same host will map to the same hashkey, which
           means no distribution of metrics takes place. The instance is  used  to  remedy  that  situation.  An
           instance  is  appended  to  the  memeber  after  the  port,  and  separated  by  an equals sign, e.g.
           <b>127.0.0.1:2006=a</b> for instance <b>a</b>.

           Consistent hashes are consistent in the sense that removal of a member from the  cluster  should  not
           result  in a complete re-mapping of all metrics to members, but instead only add the metrics from the
           removed member to all remaining members, approximately each  gets  its  fair  share.  The  other  way
           around, when a member is added, each member should see a subset of its metrics now being addressed to
           the  new member. This is an important advantage over a normal hash, where each removal or addition of
           members (also via e.g. a change in their IP address or hostname) would cause a full re-mapping of all
           metrics over all available metrics.

       •   <b>fnv1a_ch</b> cluster

           The <b>fnv1a_ch</b> cluster is a identical in behaviour to <b>carbon_ch</b>, but it uses a different hash technique
           (FNV1a) which is faster but more importantly defined to get  by  the  beforementioned  limitation  of
           <b>carbon_ch</b>  to  use  both host and port from the members. This is useful when multiple targets live on
           the same host just separated by port.

           Since the instance property is no longer necessary with <b>fnv1a_ch</b> this way, this cluster type uses  it
           to  completely  override  the  string that the hashkey should be calculated off. This allows for many
           things, including masquerading old IP addresses, but it basically can be used to make  the  hash  key
           location   agnostic   of   the   (physical)   location   of   that   key.  For  example,  usage  like
           <b>10.0.0.1:2003=4d79d13554fa1301476c1f9fe968b0ac</b> would allow to change port and/or ip  address  of  the
           server  that  receives  data for the instance key. Obviously, this way migration of data can be dealt
           with much more conveniently. Note that since the instance name is used as full hash input,  instances
           as  <b>a</b>,  <b>b</b>,  etc.  will  likely  result in poor hash distribution, since their hashes have very little
           input. Consider using longer and mostly differing instance names such as  random  hashes  for  better
           hash distribution behaviour.

       •   <b>jump_fnv1a_ch</b> cluster

           The  <b>jump_fnv1a_ch</b>  cluster  is also a consistent hash cluster like the previous two, but it does not
           take the member host, port or instance into account at all. Whether this is useful to you depends  on
           your scenario. The jump hash has almost perfect balancing over the members defined in the cluster, at
           the  expense  of not being able to remove any member but the last in order as defined in the cluster.
           What this means is that this hash is fine to use with ever growing clusters  where  older  nodes  are
           never removed.

           If you have a cluster where removal of old nodes takes place often, the jump hash is not suitable for
           you.  Jump  hash  works  with servers in an ordered list without gaps. To influence the ordering, the
           instance given to the server will be used as sorting key. Without, the order will be as given in  the
           file.  It  is a good practice to fix the order of the servers with instances such that it is explicit
           what the right nodes for the jump hash are.

   <b>MATCHES</b>
       Match rules are the way to direct incoming metrics to one or more clusters. Match rules are processed top
       to bottom as they are defined in the file. It is possible to define multiple matches in  the  same  rule.
       Each  match  rule can send data to one or more clusters. Since match rules "fall through" unless the <b>stop</b>
       keyword is added, carefully crafted  match  expression  can  be  used  to  target  multiple  clusters  or
       aggregations.  This  ability  allows to replicate metrics, as well as send certain metrics to alternative
       clusters with careful ordering and usage of the <b>stop</b> keyword. The special cluster <b>blackhole</b> discards  any
       metrics  sent  to  it.  This  can  be  useful  for weeding out unwanted metrics in certain cases. Because
       throwing metrics away is pointless if other  matches  would  accept  the  same  data,  a  match  with  as
       destination  the  blackhole cluster, has an implicit <b>stop</b>. The <b>validation</b> clause adds a check to the data
       (what comes after the metric) in the form of a regular expression.  When  this  expression  matches,  the
       match  rule  will execute as if no validation clause was present. However, if it fails, the match rule is
       aborted, and no metrics will be sent to destinations, this is the <b>drop</b> behaviour. When <b>log</b> is  used,  the
       metric  is  logged to stderr. Care should be taken with the latter to avoid log flooding. When a validate
       clause is present, destinations need not to be present, this allows  for  applying  a  global  validation
       rule.  Note  that  the cleansing rules are applied before validation is done, thus the data will not have
       duplicate spaces. The <b>route</b> <b>using</b> clause is used to perform a temporary modification to the key used  for
       input  to  the  consistent  hashing routines. The primary purpose is to route traffic so that appropriate
       data is sent to the needed aggregation instances.

   <b>REWRITES</b>
       Rewrite rules take a regular expression as input to match incoming metrics, and transform them  into  the
       desired  new  metric name. In the replacement, backreferences are allowed to match capture groups defined
       in the input regular expression. A match  of  <b>server\.(x|y|z)\.</b>  allows  to  use  e.g.  <b>role.\1.</b>  in  the
       substitution.  A  few caveats apply to the current implementation of rewrite rules. First, their location
       in the config file determines when the rewrite is performed. The rewrite is  done  in-place,  as  such  a
       match  rule  before  the  rewrite would match the original name, a match rule after the rewrite no longer
       matches the original name. Care should  be  taken  with  the  ordering,  as  multiple  rewrite  rules  in
       succession  can  take  place,  e.g. <b>a</b> gets replaced by <b>b</b> and <b>b</b> gets replaced by <b>c</b> in a succeeding rewrite
       rule. The second caveat with the current implementation, is that  the  rewritten  metric  names  are  not
       cleansed,  like  newly  incoming  metrics  are.  Thus, double dots and potential dangerous characters can
       appear if the replacement string is crafted to produce them. It is the responsibility of  the  writer  to
       make sure the metrics are clean. If this is an issue for routing, one can consider to have a rewrite-only
       instance  that  forwards  all  metrics to another instance that will do the routing. Obviously the second
       instance will cleanse the metrics as they come in. The backreference notation  allows  to  lowercase  and
       uppercase  the  replacement  string  with  the use of the underscore (<b>_</b>) and carret (<b>^</b>) symbols following
       directly after the backslash. For example, <b>role.\_1.</b> as substitution will lowercase the contents  of  <b>\1</b>.
       The  dot  (<b>.</b>) can be used in a similar fashion, or followed after the underscore or caret to replace dots
       with underscores in the substitution. This can be handy for some situations where  metrics  are  sent  to
       graphite.

   <b>AGGREGATIONS</b>
       The  aggregations  defined  take  one  or more input metrics expressed by one or more regular expresions,
       similar to the match rules. Incoming metrics are aggregated over a period of time defined by the interval
       in seconds. Since events may arrive a bit later in time, the expiration time in seconds defines when  the
       aggregations should be considered final, as no new entries are allowed to be added any more. On top of an
       aggregation  multiple  aggregations  can  be  computed.  They can be of the same or different aggregation
       types, but should write to a unique new metric. The metric names can  include  back  references  like  in
       rewrite expressions, allowing for powerful single aggregation rules that yield in many aggregations. When
       no  <b>send</b>  <b>to</b>  clause  is given, produced metrics are sent to the relay as if they were submitted from the
       outside, hence match and aggregation rules apply to those. Care should be taken that  loops  are  avoided
       this  way.  For  this  reason,  the use of the <b>send</b> <b>to</b> clause is encouraged, to direct the output traffic
       where possible. Like for match rules, it is possible to define multiple cluster targets. Also, like match
       rules, the <b>stop</b> keyword applies to control the flow of metrics in the matching process.

   <b>STATISTICS</b>
       The <b>send</b> <b>statistics</b> <b>to</b> construct is deprecated and will be removed in the next release. Use  the  special
       <b>statistics</b> construct instead.

       The  <b>statistics</b>  construct can control a couple of things about the (internal) statistics produced by the
       relay. The <b>send</b> <b>to</b> target can be used to avoid router loops  by  sending  the  statistics  to  a  certain
       destination cluster(s). By default the metrics are prefixed with <b>carbon.relays.&lt;hostname&gt;</b>, where hostname
       is  determinted  on startup and can be overridden using the <b>-H</b> argument. This prefix can be set using the
       <b>prefix</b> <b>with</b> clause similar to a rewrite rule target. The input match in this case is the pre-set  regular
       expression  <b>^(([^.]+)(\..*)?)$</b>  on  the  hostname. As such, one can see that the default prefix is set by
       <b>carbon.relays.\.1</b>. Note that this uses the replace-dot-with-underscore replacement feature  from  rewrite
       rules.  Given  the input expression, the following match groups are available: <b>\1</b> the entire hostname, <b>\2</b>
       the short hostname and <b>\3</b> the domainname (with leading dot). It may make sense to replace the default  by
       something  like  <b>carbon.relays.\_2</b>  for  certain  scenarios, to always use the lowercased short hostname,
       which following the expression doesn´t contain a dot. By default, the  metrics  are  submitted  every  60
       seconds, this can be changed using the <b>submit</b> <b>every</b> <b>&lt;interval&gt;</b> <b>seconds</b> clause.
       To  obtain  a  more  compatible  set  of values to carbon-cache.py, use the <b>reset</b> <b>counters</b> <b>after</b> <b>interval</b>
       clause to make values non-cumulative, that is, they will report  the  change  compared  to  the  previous
       value.

   <b>LISTENERS</b>
       The  ports  and  protocols  the  relay  should listen for incoming connections can be specified using the
       <b>listen</b> directive. Currently, all listeners need to be  of  <b>linemode</b>  type.  An  optional  compression  or
       encryption  wrapping  can  be  specified for the port and optional interface given by ip address, or unix
       socket by file. When interface is not specified, the any interface  on  all  available  ip  protocols  is
       assumed. If no <b>listen</b> directive is present, the relay will use the default listeners for port 2003 on tcp
       and  udp,  plus  the unix socket <b>/tmp/.s.carbon-c-relay.2003</b>. This typically expands to 5 listeners on an
       IPv6 enabled system. The default matches the behaviour of versions prior to v3.2.

   <b>INCLUDES</b>
       In case configuration becomes very long, or is managed better in separate files,  the  <b>include</b>  directive
       can  be  used  to  read  another  file.  The  given  file  will  be read in place and added to the router
       configuration at the time of inclusion. The end result is one big route configuration.  Multiple  <b>include</b>
       statements  can  be  used  throughout the configuration file. The positioning will influence the order of
       rules as normal. Beware that recursive inclusion (<b>include</b>  from  an  included  file)  is  supported,  and
       currently  no safeguards exist for an inclusion loop. For what is worth, this feature likely is best used
       with simple configuration files (e.g. not having <b>include</b> in them).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>carbon-c-relay</b> evolved over time, growing features on demand as the tool proved to be stable and  fitting
       the job well. Below follow some annotated examples of constructs that can be used with the relay.

       Clusters  can be defined as much as necessary. They receive data from match rules, and their type defines
       which members of the cluster finally get the metric data. The simplest cluster form is a <b>forward</b> cluster:

           cluster send-through
               forward
                   10.1.0.1
               ;

       Any metric sent to the <b>send-through</b> cluster would simply be forwarded  to  the  server  at  IPv4  address
       <b>10.1.0.1</b>. If we define multiple servers, all of those servers would get the same metric, thus:

           cluster send-through
               forward
                   10.1.0.1
                   10.2.0.1
               ;

       The  above results in a duplication of metrics send to both machines. This can be useful, but most of the
       time it is not. The <b>any_of</b> cluster type is like <b>forward</b>, but it sends each incoming metric to any of  the
       members. The same example with such cluster would be:

           cluster send-to-any-one
               any_of 10.1.0.1:2010 10.1.0.1:2011;

       This  would  implement a multipath scenario, where two servers are used, the load between them is spread,
       but should any of them fail, all metrics are sent to the remaining one. This  typically  works  well  for
       upstream  relays,  or for balancing carbon-cache processes running on the same machine. Should any member
       become unavailable, for instance due to a rolling restart, the other members receive the traffic.  If  it
       is  necessary  to  have true fail-over, where the secondary server is only used if the first is down, the
       following would implement that:

           cluster try-first-then-second
               failover 10.1.0.1:2010 10.1.0.1:2011;

       These types are different from the two consistent hash cluster types:

           cluster graphite
               carbon_ch
                   127.0.0.1:2006=a
                   127.0.0.1:2007=b
                   127.0.0.1:2008=c
               ;

       If a member in this example fails, all metrics that would go to  that  member  are  kept  in  the  queue,
       waiting  for  the  member  to  return.  This  is useful for clusters of carbon-cache machines where it is
       desirable that the same metric ends up  on  the  same  server  always.  The  <b>carbon_ch</b>  cluster  type  is
       compatible  with  carbon-relay  consistent  hash,  and  can  be  used  for existing clusters populated by
       carbon-relay. For new clusters, however, it is better to use the <b>fnv1a_ch</b> cluster type, for it is faster,
       and allows to balance over the same address but different ports without an instance number, in  constrast
       to <b>carbon_ch</b>.

       Because  we can use multiple clusters, we can also replicate without the use of the <b>forward</b> cluster type,
       in a more intelligent way:

           cluster dc-old
               carbon_ch replication 2
                   10.1.0.1
                   10.1.0.2
                   10.1.0.3
               ;
           cluster dc-new1
               fnv1a_ch replication 2
                   10.2.0.1
                   10.2.0.2
                   10.2.0.3
               ;
           cluster dc-new2
               fnv1a_ch replication 2
                   10.3.0.1
                   10.3.0.2
                   10.3.0.3
               ;

           match *
               send to dc-old
               ;
           match *
               send to
                   dc-new1
                   dc-new2
               stop
               ;

       In this example all incoming metrics are first sent to <b>dc-old</b>, then <b>dc-new1</b> and finally to <b>dc-new2</b>.  Note
       that the cluster type of <b>dc-old</b> is different. Each incoming metric will be send to 2 members of all three
       clusters,  thus  replicating  to  in  total  6 destinations. For each cluster the destination members are
       computed independently. Failure of clusters or members  does  not  affect  the  others,  since  all  have
       individual  queues.  The  above example could also be written using three match rules for each dc, or one
       match rule for all three dcs. The difference is mainly in performance, the number of times  the  incoming
       metric  has  to  be  matched  against  an  expression. The <b>stop</b> rule in <b>dc-new</b> match rule is not strictly
       necessary in this example, because there are no more following match rules. However, if the  match  would
       target  a  specific  subset, e.g. <b>^sys\.</b>, and more clusters would be defined, this could be necessary, as
       for instance in the following abbreviated example:

           cluster dc1-sys ... ;
           cluster dc2-sys ... ;

           cluster dc1-misc ... ;
           cluster dc2-misc ... ;

           match ^sys\. send to dc1-sys;
           match ^sys\. send to dc2-sys stop;

           match * send to dc1-misc;
           match * send to dc2-misc stop;

       As can be seen, without the <b>stop</b> in dc2-sys´ match rule, all metrics starting with  <b>sys.</b>  would  also  be
       send  to dc1-misc and dc2-misc. It can be that this is desired, of course, but in this example there is a
       dedicated cluster for the <b>sys</b> metrics.

       Suppose there would be some unwanted metric that unfortunately is generated, let´s  assume  some  bad/old
       software.  We  don´t  want  to  store this metric. The <b>blackhole</b> cluster is suitable for that, when it is
       harder to actually whitelist all wanted metrics. Consider the following:

           match
                   some_legacy1$
                   some_legacy2$
               send to blackhole
               stop;

       This would throw away all metrics that end with <b>some_legacy</b>, that would otherwise be hard to filter  out.
       Since the order matters, it can be used in a construct like this:

           cluster old ... ;
           cluster new ... ;

           match * send to old;

           match unwanted send to blackhole stop;

           match * send to new;

       In  this  example  the  old cluster would receive the metric that´s unwanted for the new cluster. So, the
       order in which the rules occur does matter for the execution.

       Validation can be used to ensure the data for metrics is as expected. A global validation for just number
       (no floating point) values could be:

           match *
               validate ^[0-9]+\ [0-9]+$ else drop
               ;

       (Note the escape with backslash <b>\</b> of the space, you might be able to use <b>\s</b> or  <b>[:space:]</b>  instead,  this
       depends on your configured regex implementation.)

       The validation clause can exist on every match rule, so in principle, the following is valid:

           match ^foo
               validate ^[0-9]+\ [0-9]+$ else drop
               send to integer-cluster
               ;
           match ^foo
               validate ^[0-9.e+-]+\ [0-9.e+-]+$ else drop
               send to float-cluster
               stop;

       Note  that  the  behaviour  is  different  in  the  previous  two  examples. When no <b>send</b> <b>to</b> clusters are
       specified, a validation error makes the match behave like the <b>stop</b> keyword  is  present.  Likewise,  when
       validation  passes,  processing  continues with the next rule. When destination clusters are present, the
       <b>match</b> respects the <b>stop</b> keyword as normal. When specified, processing will always stop when specified so.
       However, if validation fails, the rule does not send anything to the  destination  clusters,  the  metric
       will be dropped or logged, but never sent.

       The  relay  is  capable  of  rewriting incoming metrics on the fly. This process is done based on regular
       expressions with capture groups that allow to substitute parts in a  replacement  string.  Rewrite  rules
       allow  to cleanup metrics from applications, or provide a migration path. In it´s simplest form a rewrite
       rule looks like this:

           rewrite ^server\.(.+)\.(.+)\.([a-zA-Z]+)([0-9]+)
               into server.\_1.\2.\3.\3\4
               ;

       In   this   example   a    metric    like    <b>server.DC.role.name123</b>    would    be    transformed    into
       <b>server.dc.role.name.name123</b>.  For  rewrite  rules hold the same as for matches, that their order matters.
       Hence to build on top of the old/new cluster example done earlier, the following would store the original
       metric name in the old cluster, and the new metric name in the new cluster:

           match * send to old;

           rewrite ... ;

           match * send to new;

       Note that after the rewrite, the original metric name is no longer  available,  as  the  rewrite  happens
       in-place.

       Aggregations  are probably the most complex part of carbon-c-relay. Two ways of specifying aggregates are
       supported by carbon-c-relay. The first, static rules, are handled by an optimiser  which  tries  to  fold
       thousands  of  rules into groups to make the matching more efficient. The second, dynamic rules, are very
       powerful compact definitions with  possibly  thousands  of  internal  instantiations.  A  typical  static
       aggregation looks like:

           aggregate
                   ^sys\.dc1\.somehost-[0-9]+\.somecluster\.mysql\.replication_delay
                   ^sys\.dc2\.somehost-[0-9]+\.somecluster\.mysql\.replication_delay
               every 10 seconds
               expire after 35 seconds
               timestamp at end of bucket
               compute sum write to
                   mysql.somecluster.total_replication_delay
               compute average write to
                   mysql.somecluster.average_replication_delay
               compute max write to
                   mysql.somecluster.max_replication_delay
               compute count write to
                   mysql.somecluster.replication_delay_metric_count
               ;

       In  this  example,  four aggregations are produced from the incoming matching metrics. In this example we
       could have written the two matches as one, but for demonstration purposes we did not. Obviously they  can
       refer  to  different metrics, if that makes sense. The <b>every</b> <b>10</b> <b>seconds</b> clause specifies in what interval
       the aggregator can expect new metrics to arrive. This interval is used to produce the aggregations,  thus
       each  10 seconds 4 new metrics are generated from the data received sofar. Because data may be in transit
       for some reason, or generation stalled, the <b>expire</b> <b>after</b> clause specifies how long  the  data  should  be
       kept  before considering a data bucket (which is aggregated) to be complete. In the example, 35 was used,
       which means after 35 seconds the first aggregates are produced. It also means that metrics can arrive  35
       seconds late, and still be taken into account. The exact time at which the aggregate metrics are produced
       is random between 0 and interval (10 in this case) seconds after the expiry time. This is done to prevent
       thundering  herds  of metrics for large aggregation sets. The <b>timestamp</b> that is used for the aggregations
       can be specified to be the <b>start</b>, <b>middle</b> or <b>end</b> of the bucket. Original carbon-aggregator.py uses  <b>start</b>,
       while  carbon-c-relay´s default has always been <b>end</b>. The <b>compute</b> clauses demonstrate a single aggregation
       rule can produce multiple aggregates, as often is the case. Internally, this comes for  free,  since  all
       possible  aggregates  are  always  calculated, whether or not they are used. The produced new metrics are
       resubmitted to the relay, hence matches defined before in the  configuration  can  match  output  of  the
       aggregator.  It  is  important  to  avoid  loops,  that  can be generated this way. In general, splitting
       aggregations to their own carbon-c-relay instance, such that it is easy to forward the  produced  metrics
       to another relay instance is a good practice.

       The previous example could also be written as follows to be dynamic:

           aggregate
                   ^sys\.dc[0-9].(somehost-[0-9]+)\.([^.]+)\.mysql\.replication_delay
               every 10 seconds
               expire after 35 seconds
               compute sum write to
                   mysql.host.\1.replication_delay
               compute sum write to
                   mysql.host.all.replication_delay
               compute sum write to
                   mysql.cluster.\2.replication_delay
               compute sum write to

               ;

       Here a single match, results in four aggregations, each of a different scope. In this example aggregation
       based  on  hostname  and  cluster  are being made, as well as the more general <b>all</b> targets, which in this
       example have both identical values. Note that  with  this  single  aggregation  rule,  both  per-cluster,
       per-host  and  total  aggregations  are  produced.  Obviously,  the  input metrics define which hosts and
       clusters are produced.

       With use of the <b>send</b> <b>to</b> clause, aggregations can be made more intuitive and  less  error-prone.  Consider
       the below example:

           cluster graphite fnv1a_ch ip1 ip2 ip3;

           aggregate ^sys\.somemetric
               every 60 seconds
               expire after 75 seconds
               compute sum write to
                   sys.somemetric
               send to graphite
               stop
               ;

           match * send to graphite;

       It  sends all incoming metrics to the graphite cluster, except the sys.somemetric ones, which it replaces
       with a sum of all the incoming ones. Without a <b>stop</b> in the aggregate, this causes a loop, and without the
       <b>send</b> <b>to</b>, the metric name can´t be kept its original name,  for  the  output  now  directly  goes  to  the
       cluster.

</pre><h4><b>STATISTICS</b></h4><pre>
       When  <b>carbon-c-relay</b>  is run without <b>-d</b> or <b>-s</b> arguments, statistics will be produced. By default they are
       sent to the relay itself in the form of  <b>carbon.relays.&lt;hostname&gt;.*</b>.  See  the  <b>statistics</b>  construct  to
       override  this  prefix,  sending  interval and values produced. While many metrics have a similar name to
       what carbon-cache.py would produce, their values are  likely  different.  By  default,  most  values  are
       running  counters  which  only  increase  over time. The use of the nonNegativeDerivative() function from
       graphite is useful with these.

       The following metrics are produced under the <b>carbon.relays.&lt;hostname&gt;</b> namespace:

       •   metricsReceived

           The number of metrics that were received by the relay. Received here means that they  were  seen  and
           processed by any of the dispatchers.

       •   metricsSent

           The  number of metrics that were sent from the relay. This is a total count for all servers combined.
           When incoming metrics are duplicated by the cluster configuration,  this  counter  will  include  all
           those  duplications.  In  other  words,  the  amount  of metrics that were successfully sent to other
           systems. Note that metrics that are processed (received) but still in the sending queue (queued)  are
           not included in this counter.

       •   metricsDiscarded

           The  number  of  input  lines that were not considered to be a valid metric. Such lines can be empty,
           only containing whitespace, or hitting the limits given for max input length and/or max metric length
           (see <b>-m</b> and <b>-M</b> options).

       •   metricsQueued

           The total number of metrics that are currently in the queues for all the server targets. This  metric
           is  not  cumulative,  for  it  is  a sample of the queue size, which can (and should) go up and down.
           Therefore you should not use the derivative function for this metric.

       •   metricsDropped

           The total number of metric that had to be dropped due to server queues overflowing. A queue typically
           overflows when the server it tries to send its metrics to is not reachable, or too slow in  ingesting
           the  amount  of  metrics queued. This can be network or resource related, and also greatly depends on
           the rate of metrics being sent to the particular server.

       •   metricsBlackholed

           The number of metrics that did not match any rule, or  matched  a  rule  with  blackhole  as  target.
           Depending on your configuration, a high value might be an indication of a misconfiguration somewhere.
           These metrics were received by the relay, but never sent anywhere, thus they disappeared.

       •   metricStalls

           The  number  of  times  the relay had to stall a client to indicate that the downstream server cannot
           handle the stream of metrics. A stall is only performed when the queue is  full  and  the  server  is
           actually  receptive  of  metrics,  but  just  too  slow at the moment. Stalls typically happen during
           micro-bursts, where the client typically is unaware that it should stop sending more data,  while  it
           is able to.

       •   connections

           The  number  of  connect  requests  handled. This is an ever increasing number just counting how many
           connections were accepted.

       •   disconnects

           The number of disconnected clients. A disconnect either happens because the client goes away, or  due
           to  an idle timeout in the relay. The difference between this metric and connections is the amount of
           connections actively held by the relay. In normal situations this amount  remains  within  reasonable
           bounds. Many connections, but few disconnections typically indicate a possible connection leak in the
           client.  The idle connections disconnect in the relay here is to guard against resource drain in such
           scenarios.

       •   dispatch_wallTime_us

           The number of microseconds spent by the dispatchers to do their work.  In  particular  on  multi-core
           systems,  this value can be confusing, however, it indicates how long the dispatchers were doing work
           handling clients. It includes everything they do, from reading data from a socket,  cleaning  up  the
           input  metric, to adding the metric to the appropriate queues. The larger the configuration, and more
           complex in terms of matches, the more time the dispatchers will spend on the cpu. But also time  they
           do  /not/  spend  on the cpu is included in this number. It is the pure wallclock time the dispatcher
           was serving a client.

       •   dispatch_sleepTime_us

           The number of microseconds spent by the dispatchers sleeping waiting for work. When this  value  gets
           small (or even zero) the dispatcher has so much work that it doesn´t sleep any more, and likely can´t
           process  the  work in a timely fashion any more. This value plus the wallTime from above sort of sums
           up to the total uptime taken by this dispatcher. Therefore, expressing the wallTime as percentage  of
           this sum gives the busyness percentage draining all the way up to 100% if sleepTime goes to 0.

       •   server_wallTime_us

           The  number  of  microseconds  spent by the servers to send the metrics from their queues. This value
           includes connection creation, reading from the queue, and sending metrics over the network.

       •   dispatcherX

           For each indivual dispatcher, the metrics received and blackholed  plus  the  wall  clock  time.  The
           values are as described above.

       •   destinations.X

           For  all  known destinations, the number of dropped, queued and sent metrics plus the wall clock time
           spent. The values are as described above.

       •   aggregators.metricsReceived

           The number of metrics that were matched an aggregator rule and were accepted by the aggregator.  When
           a  metric matches multiple aggregators, this value will reflect that. A metric is not counted when it
           is considered syntactically invalid, e.g. no value was found.

       •   aggregators.metricsDropped

           The number of metrics that were sent to an aggregator, but did  not  fit  timewise.  This  is  either
           because the metric was too far in the past or future. The expire after clause in aggregate statements
           controls how long in the past metric values are accepted.

       •   aggregators.metricsSent

           The  number  of  metrics that were sent from the aggregators. These metrics were produced and are the
           actual results of aggregations.

       This   project   aims    to    be    a    fast    replacement    of    the    original    Carbon    relay
       <u><a href="http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/1.0/carbon-daemons.html">http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/1.0/carbon-daemons.html</a>#carbon-relay-py</u>.    <b>carbon-c-relay</b>   aims   to
       deliver performance and configurability. Carbon is single  threaded,  and  sending  metrics  to  multiple
       consistent-hash  clusters  requires chaining of relays. This project provides a multithreaded relay which
       can address multiple targets and clusters for each and every metric based on pattern matches.

       There   are   a   couple   more   replacement   projects   out   there,   which    are    carbon-relay-ng
       <u>https://github.com/graphite-ng/carbon-relay-ng</u>                     and                     graphite-relay
       <u>https://github.com/markchadwick/graphite-relay</u>.

       Compared to carbon-relay-ng, this project does provide carbon´s consistent-hash routing.  graphite-relay,
       which  does  this, however doesn´t do metric-based matches to direct the traffic, which this project does
       as well. To date, carbon-c-relay can do aggregations, failover targets and more.
