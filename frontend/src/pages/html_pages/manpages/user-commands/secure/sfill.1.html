</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sfill - secure free disk and inode space wiper (secure_deletion toolkit)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sfill</b> <b>[-f]</b> <b>[-i]</b> <b>[-I]</b> <b>[-l]</b> <b>[-l]</b> <b>[-v]</b> <b>[-z]</b> <b>directory/mountpoint</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>sfill</u>  is  designed  to delete data which lies on available diskspace on mediums in a secure manner which
       can not be recovered by thieves, law enforcement or other threats.  The wipe algorithm is  based  on  the
       paper "Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory" presented at the 6th Usenix Security
       Symposium by Peter Gutmann, one of the leading civilian cryptographers.

       The <u>secure</u> <u>data</u> <u>deletion</u> process of sfill goes like this:

       <b>*</b>      1 pass with 0xff

       <b>*</b>      5 random passes. /dev/urandom is used for a secure RNG if available.

       <b>*</b>      27 passes with special values defined by Peter Gutmann.

       <b>*</b>      5 random passes. /dev/urandom is used for a secure RNG if available.

       afterwards  as many temporary files as possible are generated to wipe the free inode space. After no more
       temporary files can be created, they are removed and sfill is finished.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDLINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-f</b>     fast (and insecure mode): no /dev/urandom, no synchronize mode.

       <b>-i</b>     wipe only free inode space, not free disk space

       <b>-I</b>     wipe only free disk space, not free inode space

       <b>-l</b>     lessens the security. Only two passes are written: one mode with 0xff and a final mode with random
              values.

       <b>-l</b>     -l for a second time lessons the security even more: only one random pass is written.

       <b>-v</b>     verbose mode

       <b>-z</b>     wipes the last write with zeros instead of random data

       <b>directory/mountpoint</b> this is the location of the file created in your filesystem. It should  lie  on  the
       partition you want to write.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>FILESYSTEM</b> <b>INTELLIGENCE</b>
              Most  filesystems  (ext2,  ffs, etc.) have several features included to enhance performance, which
              will result in that sfill might not receive all available free space. Sad but true. Nothing can be
              done about that ...

       <b>NFS</b>    Beware of NFS. You can't ensure you really completely wiped  your  data  from  the  remote  disks.
              (especially because of caching)

       <b>Raid</b>   Raid Systems use stripped disks and have got large caches. It's hard to wipe them.

       <b>swap</b>   Some of your data might have a copy in your swapspace.  <u>sswap</u> is available for this task.

       <b>fat32</b>  The  size of files with <u>fat32</u> filesystems is limited to 4 GB; <u>sfill</u> can fail to smash the complete
              filesystem if the free space is bigger than this limit, because this command creates  the  biggest
              possible anonymous file and securely erases its content.

              To  work  around  this limitation, the recommended package <u>libgsecuredelete0</u> can be installed, and
              one can call the script  <u>/usr/libexec/libgsecuredelete0/gsd-sfill-helper</u>  which  creates  as  many
              anonymous files as the filesystem can bare, and then smashes them all.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       No  bugs. There was never a bug in the secure_deletion package (in contrast to my other tools, whew, good
       luck ;-) Send me any that you find.  Patches are nice too :)
