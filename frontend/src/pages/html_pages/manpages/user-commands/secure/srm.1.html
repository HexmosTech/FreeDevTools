</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       srm - secure remove (secure_deletion toolkit)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>srm</b> <b>[-d]</b> <b>[-f]</b> <b>[-l]</b> <b>[-l]</b> <b>[-r]</b> <b>[-v]</b> <b>[-z]</b> <b>files</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>srm</u>  is  designed to delete data on mediums in a secure manner which can not be recovered by thieves, law
       enforcement or other threats.  The wipe algorithm is based on the paper "Secure  Deletion  of  Data  from
       Magnetic  and Solid-State Memory" presented at the 6th Usenix Security Symposium by Peter Gutmann, one of
       the leading civilian cryptographers.

       The <u>secure</u> <u>data</u> <u>deletion</u> process of srm goes like this:

       <b>*</b>      1 pass with 0xff

       <b>*</b>      5 random passes. /dev/urandom is used for a secure RNG if available.

       <b>*</b>      27 passes with special values defined by Peter Gutmann.

       <b>*</b>      5 random passes. /dev/urandom is used for a secure RNG if available.

       <b>*</b>      Rename the file to a random value

       <b>*</b>      Truncate the file

       As an additional measure of security, the file is opened in O_SYNC mode and after each  pass  an  fsync()
       call  is  done.   <u>srm</u> writes 32k blocks for the purpose of speed, filling buffers of disk caches to force
       them to flush and overwriting old data which belonged to the file.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDLINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b>     ignore the two special dot files . and .. on the commandline. (so you can execute it like "srm  -d
              .* *")

       <b>-f</b>     fast (and insecure mode): no /dev/urandom, no synchronize mode.

       <b>-l</b>     lessens  the  security.  Only  two  passes are written: one mode with 0xff and a final mode random
              values.

       <b>-l</b>     -l for a second time lessons the security even more: only one random pass is written.

       <b>-r</b>     recursive mode, deletes all subdirectories.

       <b>-v</b>     verbose mode

       <b>-z</b>     wipes the last write with zeros instead of random data

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>NFS</b>    Beware of NFS. You can't ensure you really completely wiped your data from the remote disks.

       <b>Raid</b>   Raid Systems use stripped disks and have got large caches. It's hard to wipe them.

       <b>swap,</b> <b><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>,</b> <b>etc.</b>
              Some of your data might have a temporary (deleted) copy somewhere on  the  disk.  You  should  use
              <u>sfill</u>  which  comes  with  the  <u>secure_deletion</u> <u>package</u> to ensure to wipe also the free diskspace.
              However, If already a small file acquired a block with your precious data, no tool known to me can
              help you here. For a secure deletion of the swap space <u>sswap</u> is available.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       No bugs. There was never a bug in the secure_deletion package (in contrast to my other tools, whew,  good
       luck ;-) Send me any that you find.  Patches are nice too :)
