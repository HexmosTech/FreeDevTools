</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sdmem - secure memory wiper (secure_deletion toolkit)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sdmem</b> <b>[-f]</b> <b>[-l]</b> <b>[-l]</b> <b>[-v]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>sdmem</u>  is  designed  to delete data which may lie still in your memory (RAM) in a secure manner which can
       not be recovered by thieves, law enforcement or other threats.  Note that with the new SDRAMs, data  will
       not  wither  away  but  will  be kept static - it is easy to extract the necessary information!  The wipe
       algorithm is based on the paper "Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory"  presented
       at the 6th Usenix Security Symposium by Peter Gutmann, one of the leading civilian cryptographers.

       The <u>secure</u> <u>data</u> <u>deletion</u> process of sdmem goes like this:

       <b>*</b>      1 pass with 0x00

       <b>*</b>      5 random passes. /dev/urandom is used for a secure RNG if available.

       <b>*</b>      27 passes with special values defined by Peter Gutmann.

       <b>*</b>      5 random passes. /dev/urandom is used for a secure RNG if available.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDLINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-f</b>     fast (and insecure mode): no /dev/urandom.

       <b>-l</b>     lessens the security. Only two passes are written: the first with 0x00 and a final random one.

       <b>-l</b>     -l for a second time lessons the security even more: only one pass with 0x00 is written.

       <b>-v</b>     verbose mode

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b></h4><pre>
       This utility was originally called
              <u>smem</u> but was renamed for debian to avoid name clashes with another package.

</pre><h4><b>BEWARE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SLOW</b>   Wiping the memory is very slow. You might use sdmem with the -ll option. (tip)

       <b>BETA!</b>  <u>sdmem</u> is still beta.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       No  bugs. There was never a bug in the secure_deletion package (in contrast to my other tools, whew, good
       luck ;-) Send me any that you find.  Patches are nice too :)
