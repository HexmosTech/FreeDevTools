</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program is part of <b><a href="../man1/Netpbm.1.html">Netpbm</a></b>(1).

       <b>pnmhisteq</b>   increases  the  contrast  of  a  PGM  or  PPM  image  through  the  technique  of  "histogram
       equalization."[1]

       <b>pnmhisteq</b> computes a histogram of the luminosity of the pixels  in  the  image.   It  then  calculates  a
       mapping  between  each  luminosity  and a new luminosity such that it spreads out intensity levels around
       histogram peaks and compresses them at troughs.  I.e.  it moves pixels around in the histogram so  as  to
       make  it  flat.   It  applies that mapping to the input image to produce the output image.  The effect of
       this is that the image has equal numbers of pixels at each possible intensity level, which means it  uses
       the available levels of intensity more efficiently and thereby has more visible detail.

       Mathematically, the luminosity mapping is this: Assume the pixels are sorted by luminosity into <u>B</u> buckets
       numbered  from  0  (lowest luminosity) to <u>B</u>-1.  <u>N[i]</u> is the number of pixels in bucket <u>i</u>.  <u>T</u> is the total
       number of pixels (sum of <u>N[i]</u> over all <u>i</u>).  <u>W</u> is the luminosity of white.

       <b>pnmhisteq</b> replaces an input pixel whose luminosity falls into bucket <u>j</u> with one whose luminosity is:

             j
            ---
            \
             &gt; (N[i] / T) * W
            /
            ---
            i=0

       Considering a grayscale image for simplicity, this means that pixels in the most luminous  bucket  become
       white.  Pixels in the 10th per centile of luminosity become 10% of white.

       <b>pnmhisteq</b>  maps  a  single  luminosity  in the input to a single luminosity in the output.  That means if
       pixels A and B both have luminosity .2 in the input, and pixel A has luminosity .4 in the output, pixel B
       also has luminosity .4 in the output.  And since the luminosities in the input are  not  continuous,  the
       luminosities  in the output aren't either and <b>pnmhisteq</b> doesn't meet the ideal of having exactly the same
       number of pixels of each luminosity in the output.

       If you're processing a related set of images, for example frames of an animation, it's generally best  to
       apply  the  same luminosity mapping to every frame, since otherwise you'll get distracting frame-to-frame
       changes in the brightness of objects.  <b>pnmhisteq</b>'s <b>-wmap</b> option allows you to save, as a PGM  image,  the
       luminosity  map  it computes from an image.  The <b>-rmap</b> option causes <b>pnmisteq</b> to use such an image as its
       luminosity map.

       So you can run <b>pnmhisteq</b> with <b>-wmap</b> on a composite you created with <b>pamcat</b> of the images  you  intend  to
       process.   Then,  you  can run <b>pnmisteq</b> with <b>-rmap</b> on each of the individual images, using the luminosity
       map you generated from the composite.

       Use <b>pnmhistmap</b> to see the result.  Run a color image through <b>ppmtopgm</b> first so that you see  a  histogram
       of  the  luminosity instead of histograms of the three color components.  It should generally show a flat
       histogram.  But because of the quantization effects described above, you might see high bars  interleaved
       with  low  bars,  with  the  local  average  being flat.  To see local averages, use the <b>-width</b> option of
       <b>pnmhistmap</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most notably  <b>-quiet</b>,  see   Common
       Options ), <b>pnmhisteq</b> recognizes the following command line options:

       You can abbreviate any option to its shortest unique prefix.

       <b>-gray</b>  When processing a color image, only gray pixels (those with identical red, green, and blue values)
              are  included in the histogram and modified in the output image.  This is a special purpose option
              intended for images where the actual data are gray scale, with color annotations  you  don't  want
              modified.  Weather satellite images that show continent outlines in color are best processed using
              this option.  The option has no effect when the input is a graymap.

       <b>-noblack</b>
              Do  not  include black pixels in the equalization.  The black pixels in the output are exactly the
              black pixels in the input and the number of black pixels does not affect the color  of  any  other
              pixels.

              Sometimes,  black  isn't as much a color as a background or annotation for the real colors, so you
              want to treat it specially this way.  Think of a picture of stars, which is nearly all black,  but
              with  lots  of stars of different brightness.  You want to change the brightnesses of the stars to
              maximize contrast between them, but if you considered the blackness to  be  significant,  all  the
              stars would end up close to full white.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.70 (March 2015).

       <b>-nowhite</b>

              Same as <b>-noblack</b>, but for the white pixels.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.70 (March 2015).

       <b>-rmap</b> <u>mapfile</u>
              Process the image using the luminosity map specified by the PGM file <u>mapfile</u>.

              The  PGM  image,  usually created by an earlier run of <b>pnmhisteq</b> with the <b>-wmap</b> option, contains a
              single row with number of columns equal to the maxval (greatest intensity value) of the image plus
              one.  Each pixel in the image is transformed by looking up its  luminosity  in  the  corresponding
              column  in  the  map  file (column number = luminosity) and changing it to the value given by that
              column.

       <b>-wmap</b> <u>mapfile</u>
              Creates a PGM file <u>mapfile</u>, containing the luminosity map computed from the histogram of the input
              image.  This map file can be read on subsequent runs of <b>pnmhisteq</b> with the <b>-rmap</b> option,  allowing
              a group of images to be processed with an identical map.

       <b>-verbose</b>
              Prints the histogram and luminosity map on Standard Error.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Histogram  equalization  is effective for increasing the visible detail in scientific imagery and in some
       continuous-tone pictures.  It is often too drastic, however, for scanned halftone images, where  it  does
       an  excellent  job  of making halftone artifacts apparent.  You might want to experiment with <b>pnmnorm</b> and
       <b>pnmgamma</b> for more subtle contrast enhancement.

       The luminosity map file supplied by the <b>-rmap</b> option must have the same maxval as the input image.   This
       is  always  the case when the map file was created by the <b>-wmap</b> option of <b>pnmhisteq</b>.  If this restriction
       causes a problem, simply adjust the maxval of the map with <b>pamdepth</b> to agree with the input image.

       If the input is a PBM file (on which histogram equalization is an identity operation), the only effect of
       passing the file through <b>pnmhisteq</b> will be the passage of time.
