       InterIMAP - Fast bidirectional synchronization for QRESYNC-capable IMAP servers

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       interimap [<u>OPTION</u> ...]  [<u>COMMAND</u>] [<u>MAILBOX</u> ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       interimap  performs stateful synchronization between two IMAP4rev1 servers.  Such synchronization is made
       possible by  the  QRESYNC  IMAP  extension;  for  convenience  reasons  servers  must  also  support  the
       LIST-EXTENDED,  LIST-STATUS  (or  NOTIFY) and UIDPLUS IMAP extensions.  See also the <b>supported</b> <b>extensions</b>
       section below.

       Stateful synchronization is only possible for mailboxes supporting persistent message Unique  Identifiers
       (UID) and persistent storage of mod-sequences (MODSEQ); any non-compliant mailbox will cause interimap to
       abort.   Furthermore,  because UIDs are allocated not by the client but by the server, interimap needs to
       keep track of associations between local and remote UIDs for each mailbox.  The synchronization state  of
       a  mailbox  consists of its UIDNEXT and HIGHESTMODSEQ values on each server; it is then assumed that each
       message with UID smaller than UIDNEXT have been replicated to the other server,  and  that  the  metadata
       (such  as flags) of each message with MODSEQ at most HIGHESTMODSEQ have been synchronized.  Conceptually,
       the synchronization algorithm is derived from RFC 4549 with the RFC 7162 (sec. 6) amendments,  and  works
       as follows:

       1. SELECT  (on  both  servers) a mailbox the current UIDNEXT or HIGHESTMODSEQ values of which differ from
          the values found in the database (for either server).  Use the QRESYNC SELECT parameter from RFC  7162
          to  list changes (vanished messages and flag updates) since HIGHESTMODSEQ to messages with UID smaller
          than UIDNEXT.

       2. Propagate these changes onto the other server: get the corresponding UIDs from the database, then:

           a. issue a UID STORE command, followed by UID EXPUNGE, to remove messages that have not already  been
              deleted on both servers; and

           b. issue  some UID STORE commands to propagate flag updates (send a single command for each flag list
              in order the reduce the number of round trips).

           (Conflicts may occur if the metadata of a message has been updated on  both  servers  with  different
           flag  lists; in that case, interimap issues a warning and updates the message on each server with the
           union of both flag lists.)  Repeat this step if  the  server  sent  some  updates  in  the  meantime.
           Otherwise, update the HIGHESTMODSEQ value in the database.

       3. Process  new  messages  (if the current UIDNEXT value of the mailbox differs from the one found in the
          database) by issuing a UID FETCH command; process each  received  message  on-the-fly  by  issuing  an
          APPEND command with the message’s RFC822 body, FLAGS and INTERNALDATE.  Repeat this step if the server
          received  new messages in the meantime.  Otherwise, update the UIDNEXT value in the database.  Go back
          to step 2 if the server sent some metadata (such as flag) updates in the meantime.

       4. Go back to step 1 to proceed with the next unsynchronized mailbox.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       By default, interimap synchronizes each mailbox listed by the LIST "" "*" IMAP command; the <u>list-mailbox</u>,
       <u>list-select-opts</u> and <u>ignore-mailbox</u> options from the configuration file can be used to shrink  that  list
       and  save  bandwidth.  However if some extra argument are provided on the command line, interimap ignores
       these options and synchronizes the given <u>MAILBOX</u>es instead.  Note that each <u>MAILBOX</u> is taken “as is”;  in
       particular, it must be UTF-7 encoded, unquoted, and the list wildcards `*' and `%' are passed verbatim to
       the  IMAP  server.  If the local and remote hierarchy delimiter differ, then within the <u>MAILBOX</u> names the
       <u>local</u> delimiter should be used (it is transparently substituted for remote commands and responses).

       If the synchronization was interrupted during a previous run while some messages  were  being  replicated
       (but  before  the  UIDNEXT  or  HIGHESTMODSEQ  values  have  been  updated),  interimap  performs a “full
       synchronization” on theses messages: downloading the whole UID and flag  lists  on  each  servers  allows
       interimap  to  detect  messages  that  have  been  removed  or  for which their flags have changed in the
       meantime.  Finally, after propagating the offline changes  for  these  messages,  interimap  resumes  the
       synchronization for the rest of the mailbox.

       Specifying  one  of  the  commands  below  makes  interimap  perform  an  action  other  than the default
       QRESYNC-based synchronization.

       --repair [<u>MAILBOX</u> ...]
              List the database anomalies and try to  repair  them.   (Consider  only  the  given  <u>MAILBOX</u>es  if
              non-optional   arguments   are   provided.)    This  is  done  by  performing  a  so-called  “full
              synchronization”, namely: 1/ download all UIDs along with their flag list both from the local  and
              remote  servers;  2/ ensure that each entry in the database corresponds to an existing UID; and 3/
              ensure that both flag lists match.  Any message found on a server  but  not  in  the  database  is
              replicated  on  the other server (which in the worst case, might yield a message duplicate).  Flag
              conflicts are solved by updating each message to the union of both lists.

       --delete <u>MAILBOX</u> [<u>MAILBOX</u> ...]
              Delete the given <u>MAILBOX</u>es on each target (by  default  each  server  plus  the  database,  unless
              --target  specifies  otherwise) where it exists.  Note that per the IMAP4rev1 standard deletion is
              not recursive.  Thus <u>MAILBOX</u>’s children are not deleted.

       --rename <u>SOURCE</u> <u>DEST</u>
              Rename the mailbox <u>SOURCE</u> to <u>DEST</u> on each target (by default each server plus the database, unless
              --target specifies otherwise) where it exists.  interimap aborts if <u>DEST</u> already exists on  either
              target.   Note  that per the IMAP4rev1 standard renaming is recursive.  Thus <u>SOURCE</u>’s children are
              moved to become <u>DEST</u>’s children instead.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --config=<u>FILE</u>
              Specify an alternate configuration file.  Relative paths start from <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/interimap</u>, or
              <u><a href="file:~/.config/interimap">~/.config/interimap</a></u> if the XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment variable is unset.

       --target={local,remote,database}
              Limit the scope of a --delete or --rename command to the given target.  Can be repeated to act  on
              multiple targets.  By default all three targets are considered.

       --watch[=<u>seconds</u>]
              Don’t  exit  after  a successful synchronization.  Instead, keep synchronizing forever.  Sleep for
              the given number of <u>seconds</u> (by default 1 minute if --notify is unset, and 15 minutes if  --notify
              is set) between two synchronizations.  Setting this options enables SO_KEEPALIVE on the socket for
              <u>type</u>s other than tunnel.

       --notify
              Whether  to  use the IMAP NOTIFY extension to instruct the server to automatically send updates to
              the client.  (Both local and remote servers must support RFC 5465 for this to work.)  This greatly
              reduces IMAP traffic since interimap can rely on server notifications instead of manually  polling
              for  updates.   If  the  connection  remains idle for 15 minutes (configurable with --watch), then
              interimap sends a NOOP command to avoid being logged out for inactivity.

       -q, --quiet
              Try to be quiet.

       --debug
              Turn on debug mode.  Debug messages, which includes all IMAP traffic besides literals, are written
              to the given <u>logfile</u>.  The LOGIN and AUTHENTICATE commands are however redacted (in order to avoid
              disclosing authentication credentials) unless the --debug flag is set multiple times.

       -h, --help
              Output a brief help and exit.

       --version
              Show the version number and exit.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       Unless told otherwise by the --config=FILE command-line option, interimap reads  its  configuration  from
       <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/interimap/config</u>  (or  <u><a href="file:~/.config/interimap/config">~/.config/interimap/config</a></u>  if  the  XDG_CONFIG_HOME  environment
       variable is unset) as an INI file.  The syntax of the configuration file  is  a  series  of  OPTION=VALUE
       lines organized under some [SECTION]; lines starting with a `#' or `;' character are ignored as comments.
       The [local] and [remote] sections define the two IMAP servers to synchronize.  Valid options are:

       <u>database</u>
              SQLite version 3 database file to use to keep track of associations between local and remote UIDs,
              as  well  as  the  UIDVALIDITY,  UIDNEXT  and HIGHESTMODSEQ of each known mailbox on both servers.
              Relative  paths  start  from  <u>$XDG_DATA_HOME/interimap</u>,   or   <u><a href="file:~/.local/share/interimap">~/.local/share/interimap</a></u>   if   the
              XDG_DATA_HOME  environment  variable  is  unset.   This  option  is  only available in the default
              section.  (Default: HOST.db, where <u>HOST</u> is taken from the [remote] or [local]  sections,  in  that
              order.)

       <u>list-reference</u>
              An  optional “reference name” to use for the initial LIST command, indicating the context in which
              the <u>MAILBOX</u>es are interpreted.  For instance, by specifying list-reference=perso/ in  the  [local]
              section,  <u>MAILBOX</u> names are interpreted relative to perso/ on the local server; in other words the
              remote mailbox hierarchy is mapped to the perso/ sub-hierarchy  on  the  local  server.   This  is
              useful  for  synchronizing  multiple  remote servers against different namespaces belonging to the
              same local IMAP server (using a different interimap instance for each  local  namespace  ↔  remote
              synchronization).

              (Note  that if the reference name is not a level of mailbox hierarchy and/or does not end with the
              hierarchy   delimiter,   by   RFC   3501   its   interpretation   by   the    IMAP    server    is
              implementation-dependent.)

       <u>list-mailbox</u>
              A  space  separated  list  of  mailbox  patterns  to  use  when  issuing  the initial LIST command
              (overridden  by  the  <u>MAILBOX</u>es  given  as  command-line  arguments).   Names  containing  special
              characters  such as spaces or brackets need to be enclosed in double quotes.  Within double quotes
              C-style backslash escape sequences can be used (`\t' for an horizontal tab, `\n' for a  new  line,
              `\\'  for  a  backslash,  etc.),  as  well  as  hexadecimal escape sequences `\xHH'.  Furthermore,
              non-ASCII names must be UTF-7 encoded.  Two wildcards are available, and passed  verbatim  to  the
              IMAP  server:  a `*' character matches zero or more characters, while a `%' character matches zero
              or more characters up to the hierarchy delimiter.  Hard-coding the  hierarchy  delimiter  in  this
              setting  is  not  advised  because  the  server  might  silently  change it at some point.  A null
              character should be used instead.   For  instance,  if  <u>list-mailbox</u>  is  set  "foo\x00bar"  then,
              assuming  the  hierarchy  delimiter  is  `/',  only  the  mailbox  named foo/bar is considered for
              synchronization.

              This option is only available in the default  section.   (The  default  pattern,  *,  matches  all
              visible mailboxes on the server.)

       <u>list-select-opts</u>
              An  optional  space  separated list of selectors for the initial LIST command.  (Requires a server
              supporting the LIST-EXTENDED  IMAP  extension.)   Useful  values  are  SUBSCRIBED  (to  list  only
              subscribed  mailboxes),  REMOTE  (to  also  list  remote  mailboxes on a server supporting mailbox
              referrals), and RECURSIVEMATCH (to list parent mailboxes with children matching one of  the  above
              <u>list-mailbox</u> patterns).  This option is only available in the default section.

       <u>ignore-mailbox</u>
              An  optional  Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) covering mailboxes to exclude: any (UTF-7
              encoded and unquoted) mailbox listed in the initial LIST responses is ignored if  it  matches  the
              given  expression after trimming the reference names and substituting the hierarchy delimiter with
              the null character.  For  instance,  specifying  ^virtual(?:\x00|$)  excludes  the  mailbox  named
              “virtual”  as  well  as  its descendants.  Note that the <u>MAILBOX</u>es given as command-line arguments
              bypass the check and are always considered for synchronization.  This option is only available  in
              the default section.

       <u>logfile</u>
              A  file  name  to  use  to  log  debug and informational messages.  (By default these messages are
              written to the error output.)  This option is only available in the default section.

       <u>log-prefix</u>
              A <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)-like format string to use as prefix for each log message.  Interpreted  sequences  are
              %n  and  %m,  expanding  respectively  to the component name (<u>local</u>/<u>remote</u>) and to the name of the
              mailbox relevant for the log entry.  Conditions on a specifier %X can be obtained  with  %?X?then?
              or %?X?then&amp;else?, which expands to <u>then</u> if the %X specifier expands to a non-empty string, and to
              <u>else</u> (or the empty string if there is no else condition) if it doesn’t.  Literal % characters need
              to   be   escaped  as  %%,  while  &amp;,  ?  and  \  characters  need  to  be  \-escaped.   (Default:
              %?n?%?m?%n(%m)&amp;%n?: ?.)

       <u>type</u>   One of imap, imaps or tunnel.  type=imap and type=imaps are respectively used for  IMAP  and  IMAP
              over  SSL/TLS  connections over an INET socket.  type=tunnel causes interimap to create an unnamed
              pair of connected sockets for inter-process communication with a  <u>command</u>  instead  of  opening  a
              network  socket.   Note  that  specifying  type=tunnel  in  the [remote] section makes the default
              <u>database</u> to be localhost.db.  (Default: imaps.)

       <u>host</u>   Server hostname or IP address, for type=imap and type=imaps.  The value can optionally be enclosed
              in square brackets to force its interpretation as an IP  literal  (hence  skip  name  resolution).
              (Default: localhost.)

       <u>port</u>   Server port.  (Default: 143 for type=imap, 993 for type=imaps.)

       <u>proxy</u>  Optional  SOCKS  proxy  to  use  for  TCP connections to the IMAP server (type=imap and type=imaps
              only), formatted as PROTOCOL://[USER:PASSWORD@]PROXYHOST[:PROXYPORT].  If PROXYPORT is omitted, it
              is  assumed  at  port  1080.   Only  SOCKSv5  is  supported   (with   optional   username/password
              authentication),  in two flavors: socks5:// to resolve <u>hostname</u> locally, and socks5h:// to let the
              proxy resolve <u>hostname</u>.

       <u>command</u>
              Command to use for type=tunnel.  Must speak the IMAP4rev1 protocol on  its  standard  output,  and
              understand  it  on  its  standard input.  The value is passed to `<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a> -c` if it contains shell
              metacharacters; otherwise it is split into words and the resulting list is passed to <a href="../man3/execvp.3.html">execvp</a>(3).

       <u>STARTTLS</u>
              Whether to use the STARTTLS directive to upgrade to a secure connection.  Setting this to YES  for
              a  server  not  advertising  the  STARTTLS  capability  causes  interimap to immediately abort the
              connection.  (Ignored for <u>type</u>s other than imap.  Default: YES.)

       <u>auth</u>   Space-separated list of preferred authentication mechanisms.  interimap uses the  first  mechanism
              in  that  list  that  is  also  advertised  (prefixed with AUTH=) in the server’s capability list.
              Supported authentication mechanisms are PLAIN and LOGIN.  (Default: PLAIN LOGIN.)

       <u>username</u>, <u>password</u>
              Username  and  password  to  authenticate  with.   Can  be  required  for  non   pre-authenticated
              connections, depending on the chosen authentication mechanism.

       <u>compress</u>
              Whether  to  use  the  IMAP  COMPRESS  extension for servers advertising it.  (Default: NO for the
              [local] section, YES for the [remote] section.)

       <u>null-stderr</u>
              Whether to redirect <u>command</u>’s standard error to /dev/null for type=tunnel.  This option is ignored
              when the --debug flag is set.  (Default: NO.)

       <u>SSL_protocols</u>
              Space-separated list of SSL/TLS protocol versions to explicitly enable  (or  disable  if  prefixed
              with  an  exclamation  mark  !).   Potentially  known  protocols are SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1,
              TLSv1.2, and TLSv1.3, depending on the OpenSSL version used.  Enabling a protocol is a  short-hand
              for disabling all other protocols.

              <u>DEPRECATED</u>: Use <u>SSL_protocol_min</u> and/or <u>SSL_protocol_max</u> instead.

       <u>SSL_protocol_min</u>, <u>SSL_protocol_max</u>
              Set  minimum  resp.   maximum  SSL/TLS  protocol  version  to use for the connection.  Potentially
              recognized values are SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1,  TLSv1.2,  and  TLSv1.3,  depending  on  the  OpenSSL
              version used.

       <u>SSL_cipherlist</u>, <u>SSL_ciphersuites</u>
              Sets  the  TLSv1.2  and  below cipher list resp.  TLSv1.3 cipher suites.  The combination of these
              lists is sent to the server, which then  determines  which  cipher  to  use  (normally  the  first
              supported one from the list sent by the client).  The default suites depend on the OpenSSL version
              and its configuration, see <a href="../man1ssl/ciphers.1ssl.html">ciphers</a>(1ssl) for more information.

       <u>SSL_fingerprint</u>
              Space-separated  list  of  acceptable fingerprints for the server certificate’s Subject Public Key
              Info, in the form [ALGO$]DIGEST_HEX where ALGO  is  the  digest  algorithm  (by  default  sha256).
              Attempting  to  connect  to  a  server  with  a  non-matching  certificate SPKI fingerprint causes
              interimap to abort the connection during the SSL/TLS handshake.  The following command can be used
              to compute the SHA-256 digest of a certificate’s Subject Public Key Info:

                     $ openssl x509 -in /path/to/server/certificate.pem -pubkey \
                         | openssl pkey -pubin -outform DER \
                         | openssl dgst -sha256

              Specifying multiple digest values can be useful in key rollover scenarios and/or when  the  server
              supports certificates of different types (for instance a dual-cert RSA/ECDSA setup).  In that case
              the connection is aborted when none of the specified digests matches.

       <u>SSL_verify</u>
              Whether to 1/ verify the server certificate chain; and 2/ match its Subject Alternative Name (SAN)
              or Subject CommonName (CN) against the value of the <u>host</u> option.  (Default: YES.)

              Note  that  using <u>SSL_fingerprint</u> to specify the fingerprint of the server certificate provides an
              independent server authentication measure as it pins directly its  key  material  and  ignore  its
              chain of trust.

       <u>SSL_CAfile</u>
              File   containing  trusted  certificates  to  use  during  server  certificate  verification  when
              SSL_verify=YES.

              Trusted CA certificates are loaded from the default system  locations  unless  one  (or  both)  of
              <u>SSL_CAfile</u> or <u>SSL_CApath</u> is set.

       <u>SSL_CApath</u>
              Directory  to use for server certificate verification when SSL_verify=YES.  This directory must be
              in “hash format”, see <a href="../man1ssl/verify.1ssl.html">verify</a>(1ssl) for more information.

              Trusted CA certificates are loaded from the default system  locations  unless  one  (or  both)  of
              <u>SSL_CAfile</u> or <u>SSL_CApath</u> is set.

       <u>SSL_hostname</u>
              Name  to  use for the TLS SNI (Server Name Indication) extension.  The default value is taken from
              the <u>host</u> option when it is a hostname, and to the empty string when it is an IP literal.   Setting
              <u>SSL_hostname</u> to the empty string explicitly disables SNI.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>EXTENSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       interimap takes advantage of servers supporting the following extensions to the IMAP4rev1 protocol (those
       marked as “recommended” give the most significant performance gain):

       • LITERAL+ (RFC 2088, recommended);

       • MULTIAPPEND (RFC 3502, recommended);

       • COMPRESS=DEFLATE (RFC 4978, recommended);

       • NOTIFY (RFC 5465);

       • SASL-IR (RFC 4959); and

       • UNSELECT (RFC 3691).

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       • Using  interimap  on  two  identical  servers with a non-existent or empty <u>database</u> will duplicate each
         message due to the absence of local ↔ remote UID association.  (Should they  arise,  an  external  tool
         such  as  <a href="../man1/doveadm-deduplicate.1.html">doveadm-deduplicate</a>(1)  can be used to weed them out.)  Hence one needs to manually empty the
         mail store on one end when migrating to interimap from another synchronization solution.

       • interimap is single threaded and doesn’t use IMAP command pipelining.  Synchronization could be boosted
         up by sending independent commands (such as the initial LIST and STATUS commands) to  both  servers  in
         parallel, and for a given server, by sending independent commands (such as flag updates) in a pipeline.

       • Because  the IMAP protocol doesn’t have a specific response code for when a message is moved to another
         mailbox (either using the MOVE command from RFC 6851, or via COPY + STORE + EXPUNGE), moving a  message
         causes interimap to believe that it was deleted while another one (which is replicated again) was added
         to the other mailbox in the meantime.

       • Because  the IMAP protocol doesn’t provide a way for clients to determine whether a disappeared mailbox
         was deleted or renamed, interimap aborts when a known mailbox disappeared from one server but  not  the
         other.   The  --delete  (resp.   --rename) command should be used instead to delete (resp.  rename) the
         mailbox on both servers as well as within interimap’s internal database.

       • PLAIN and LOGIN are the only authentication mechanisms currently supported.

       • interimap will probably not work with non RFC-compliant servers.   In  particular,  no  work-around  is
         currently  implemented  beside the tunables in the configuration file.  Moreover, few IMAP servers have
         been tested so far.
