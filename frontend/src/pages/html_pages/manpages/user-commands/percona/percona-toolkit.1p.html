</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       percona-toolkit - Advanced command-line tools for MySQL

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Percona Toolkit is a collection of advanced command-line tools used by Percona
       (&lt;<a href="http://www.percona.com/">http://www.percona.com/</a>&gt;) support staff to perform a variety of MySQL and system tasks that are too
       difficult or complex to perform manually.

       These tools are ideal alternatives to private or "one-off" scripts because they are professionally
       developed, formally tested, and fully documented.  They are also fully self-contained, so installation is
       quick and easy and no libraries are installed.

       Percona Toolkit is derived from Maatkit and Aspersa, two of the best-known toolkits for MySQL server
       administration.  It is developed and supported by Percona.  For more information and other free, open-
       source software developed by Percona, visit &lt;<a href="http://www.percona.com/software/">http://www.percona.com/software/</a>&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>SPECIAL</b> <b>OPTION</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       Tool options use standard types ("int", "string", etc.) as well as these special types:

       time
           Time values are seconds by default.  For example, "--run-time 60"  means  60  seconds.   Time  values
           support  an  optional suffix: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days).  "--run-time 1m" means 1
           minute (the same as 60 seconds).

       size
           Size values are bytes by default.  For example, "--disk-space-free  1024"  means  1  Kibibyte.   Size
           values support an optional suffix: k (Kibibyte), M (Mebibyte), G (Gibibyte).

       DSN See "DSN (DATA SOURCE NAME) SPECIFICATIONS".

       Hash, hash, Array, array
           Hash,   hash,   Array,   and  array  values  are  comma-separated  lists  of  values.   For  example,
           "--ignore-tables foo,bar" ignores tables "foo" and "bar".

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Percona Toolkit tools can read options from configuration files.  The configuration file syntax is simple
       and direct, and bears some resemblances to the MySQL command-line client tools.  The configuration  files
       all follow the same conventions.

       Internally, what actually happens is that the lines are read from the file and then added as command-line
       options  and  arguments  to  the  tool,  so  just think of the configuration files as a way to write your
       command lines.

   <b>SYNTAX</b>
       The syntax of the configuration files is as follows:

       •   Whitespace followed by a hash sign (#) signifies that the rest of the line is  a  comment.   This  is
           deleted.  For example:

       •   Whitespace is stripped from the beginning and end of all lines.

       •   Empty lines are ignored.

       •   Each line is permitted to be in either of the following formats:

             option
             option=value

           Do  not  prefix  the  option  with  "--".   Do not quote the values, even if it has spaces; value are
           literal.  Whitespace around the equals sign is deleted during processing.

       •   Only long options are recognized.

       •   A line containing only two hyphens signals  the  end  of  option  parsing.   Any  further  lines  are
           interpreted as additional arguments (not options) to the program.

   <b>EXAMPLE</b>
       This config file for pt-stalk,

         # Config for pt-stalk
         variable=Threads_connected
         cycles=2  # trigger if problem seen twice in a row
         --
         --user daniel

       is equivalent to this command line:

         pt-stalk --variable Threads_connected --cycles 2 -- --user daniel

       Options after "--" are passed literally to mysql and mysqladmin.

   <b>READ</b> <b>ORDER</b>
       The tools read several configuration files in order:

       1.  The  global Percona Toolkit configuration file, <u>/etc/percona-toolkit/percona-toolkit.conf</u>.  All tools
           read this file, so you should only add options to it that you want to apply to all tools.

       2.  The global tool-specific configuration file, <u>/etc/percona-toolkit/TOOL.conf</u>, where "TOOL" is  a  tool
           name like "pt-query-digest".  This file is named after the specific tool you're using, so you can add
           options that apply only to that tool.

       3.  The  user's own Percona Toolkit configuration file, <u>$HOME/.percona-toolkit.conf</u>.  All tools read this
           file, so you should only add options to it that you want to apply to all tools.

       4.  The user's tool-specific configuration file, <u>$HOME/.TOOL.conf</u>, where  "TOOL"  is  a  tool  name  like
           "pt-query-digest".   This  file is named after the specific tool you're using, so you can add options
           that apply only to that tool.

   <b>SPECIFYING</b>
       There is a special "--config" option, which lets you specify which configuration  files  Percona  Toolkit
       should  read.   You  specify  a  comma-separated  list of files.  However, its behavior is not like other
       command-line options.  It must be given <b>first</b> on the command line, before any other options.  If you  try
       to  specify it anywhere else, it will cause an error.  Also, you cannot specify "--config=/path/to/file";
       you must specify the option and the path to the file  separated  by  whitespace  <u>without</u>  <u>an</u>  <u>equal</u>  <u>sign</u>
       between them, like:

         --config /path/to/file

       If  you  don't  want  any  configuration  files at all, specify "--config ''" to provide an empty list of
       files.

</pre><h4><b>DSN</b> <b>(DATA</b> <b>SOURCE</b> <b>NAME)</b> <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Percona Toolkit tools use DSNs to specify how to create a DBD connection to a MySQL server.  A DSN  is  a
       comma-separated string of "key=value" parts, like:

         h=host1,P=3306,u=bob

       The  standard  key  parts  are  shown  below,  but  some tools add additional key parts.  See each tool's
       documentation for details.

       Some tools do not use DSNs but still  connect  to  MySQL  using  options  like  "--host",  "--user",  and
       "--password".  Such tools uses these options to create a DSN automatically, behind the scenes.

       Other  tools  uses  both DSNs and options like the ones above.  The options provide defaults for all DSNs
       that do not specify the option's corresponding key part.   For  example,  if  DSN  "h=host1"  and  option
       "--port=12345" are specified, then the tool automatically adds "P=12345" to DSN.

   <b>ESCAPING</b> <b>VALUES</b>
       DSNs are usually specified on the command line, so shell quoting and escaping must be taken into account.
       Special  characters,  like  asterisk  ("*"),  need  to  be quoted and/or escaped properly to be passed as
       literal characters in DSN values.

       Since DSN parts are separated by commas, literal commas in DSN values  must  be  escaped  with  a  single
       backslash  ("\").   And  since  a  backslash is the escape character for most shells, two backslashes are
       required to pass a literal backslash.  For example, if the username is literally "my,name",  it  must  be
       specified as "my\\,name" on most shells.  This applies to DSNs and DSN-related options like "--user".

   <b>KEY</b> <b>PARTS</b>
       Many  of the tools add more parts to DSNs for special purposes, and sometimes override parts to make them
       do something slightly different.  However, all the tools support at least the following:

       A   Default character set for the connection ("SET NAMES").

           Enables character set settings in Perl and MySQL.  If the value is "utf8",  sets  Perl's  binmode  on
           STDOUT  to  utf8,  passes  the  "mysql_enable_utf8" option to DBD::mysql, and runs "SET NAMES 'utf8'"
           after connecting to MySQL.  Other values set binmode on STDOUT without the utf8 layer  and  run  "SET
           NAMES" after connecting to MySQL.

           Unfortunately, there is no way from within Perl itself to specify the client library's character set.
           "SET  NAMES"  only  affects  the server; if the client library's settings don't match, there could be
           problems.  You can use the defaults file to specify the client library's character set, however.  See
           the description of the F part below.

       D   Default database to use when connecting.  Tools may "USE" a different databases while running.

       F   Defaults file for the MySQL client library (the C client library  used  by  DBD::mysql,  <u>not</u>  <u>Percona</u>
           <u>Toolkit</u>  <u>itself</u>).   All  tools all read the "[client]" section within the defaults file.  If you omit
           this, the standard defaults files will be read in the usual order.  "Standard" varies from system  to
           system,  because  the filenames to read are compiled into the client library.  On Debian systems, for
           example,  it's  usually  "/etc/mysql/my.cnf"  then  "<a href="file:~/.my.cnf">~/.my.cnf</a>".   If  you  place  the  following  in
           "<a href="file:~/.my.cnf">~/.my.cnf</a>", you won't have to specify your MySQL username and password on the command line:

             [client]
             user=your_user_name
             pass=secret

           Omitting  the  F  part  is  usually  the  right  thing  to  do.   As long as you have configured your
           "<a href="file:~/.my.cnf">~/.my.cnf</a>" correctly, that will result in tools connecting automatically without needing a  username
           or password.

           You  can  also  specify  a default character set in the defaults file.  Unlike the "A" part described
           above, this will actually instruct the client library (DBD::mysql) to change  the  character  set  it
           uses internally, which cannot be accomplished any other way.

       h   MySQL hostname or IP address to connect to.

       L   Explicitly enable LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE.

           For  some  reason,  some  vendors  compile  libmysql  without the --enable-local-infile option, which
           disables the statement.  This can lead to weird situations, like the server  allowing  LOCAL  INFILE,
           but the client throwing exceptions if it's used.

           However,   as   long  as  the  server  allows  LOAD  DATA,  clients  can  easily  re-enable  it;  see
           &lt;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/load-data-local.html&gt;                                    and
           &lt;<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~capttofu/DBD-mysql/lib/DBD/mysql.pm">http://search.cpan.org/~capttofu/DBD-mysql/lib/DBD/mysql.pm</a>&gt;.  This option does exactly that.

       p   MySQL password to use when connecting.

       P   Port  number  to  use  for  the connection.  Note that the usual special-case behaviors apply: if you
           specify "localhost" as your hostname on Unix systems, the connection actually uses a socket file, not
           a TCP/IP connection, and thus ignores the port.

       S   MySQL socket file to use for the connection (on Unix systems).

       u   MySQL username to use when connecting, if not current system user.

   <b>BAREWORD</b>
       Many of the tools will let you specify a DSN as a single word, without any "key=value" syntax.   This  is
       called  a  'bareword'.   How  this  is handled is tool-specific, but it is usually interpreted as the "h"
       part.  The tool's "--help" output will tell you the behavior for that tool.

   <b>PROPAGATION</b>
       Many tools will let you propagate values from one DSN to the next, so you don't have to specify  all  the
       parts  for  each  DSN.  For example, if you want to specify a username and password for each DSN, you can
       connect to three hosts as follows:

        h=host1,u=fred,p=wilma host2 host3

       This is tool-specific.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The environment variable "PTDEBUG" enables verbose debugging output to STDERR.  To enable  debugging  and
       capture all output to a file, run the tool like:

          PTDEBUG=1 pt-table-checksum ... &gt; FILE 2&gt;&amp;1

       Be careful: debugging output is voluminous and can generate several megabytes of output.

</pre><h4><b>SYSTEM</b> <b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Most tools require:

       •   Perl v5.8 or newer

       •   Bash v3 or newer

       •   Core Perl modules like Time::HiRes

       Tools that connect to MySQL require:

       •   Perl modules DBI and DBD::mysql

       •   MySQL 5.0 or newer

       Percona  Toolkit  officially  supports  and  is  tested on many popular Linux distributions and MySQL 5.0
       through 5.6; see <a href="http://goo.gl/srHm7">http://goo.gl/srHm7</a> for the list of supported platforms and versions.

</pre><h4><b>IPv6</b> <b>support</b></h4><pre>
       In order to support IPv6 addresses to connect to MySQL, Perl DBD::MySQL  driver  v4.033_01  is  required.
       Also,  as stated in RFC 3986 &lt;https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt&gt; section 3.2.2 brackes must be used to
       distinguish host and port.  Examples: &lt;https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::mysql#port&gt;

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Please report bugs at &lt;https://jira.percona.com&gt;.  Include the following information in your bug report:

       •   Complete command-line used to run the tool

       •   Tool "--version"

       •   MySQL version of all servers involved

       •   Output from the tool including STDERR

       •   Input files (log/dump/config files, etc.)

       If possible, include debugging output by running the tool with "PTDEBUG"; see "ENVIRONMENT".
