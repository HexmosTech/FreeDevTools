</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       EasyH10 - manage the iRiver H10 MP3 player

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>easyh10</b> [ <u>options</u> ] [ <u>location</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       EasyH10  is  a  command-line  utility to generate a media database and playlist for an iRiver H10 digital
       audio player.  Transferring MP3/WMA/WAV files  into  the  music  directories  and  creating  M3U/M3U8/PLS
       playlist  files  under  the  music  directories  or  playlist directory must be done manually in advance.
       EasyH10 then constructs a media database from the music  files  and  converts  the  playlist  files  into
       PLP/PLA playlist files, which are recognized by the H10 player.

       Database  construction  generates  a set of database files in the database directory, obtaining the media
       information (e.g., title name, artist name,  album  name,  genre  name,  track  number,  etc.)  from  all
       MP3/WMA/WAV  files  found  in the music directories.  Among database-related options, the update mode (<b>-U</b>
       option) reads an existing media database, compares it with the current content of the music  directories,
       inserts entries for music files that have been added or updated since the previous processing, and erases
       entries  for music files that have been removed.  EasyH10 can force music tracks to be played in an order
       that a user specified with <b>-o</b> option.  The way of obtaining the information  of  a  music  file  is  also
       configurable (see <b>-z</b> option).

       Playlist  conversion  targets  all M3U/M3U8/PLS playlist files located in the playlist directory (with <b>-P</b>
       option) and/or music directories (with <b>-M</b> option).  For each target, it finds the music files referred by
       the playlist and writes out an iRiver-specific playlist file into the playlist directory  with  the  same
       file  name.   The  converted  playlist  files  will  have  .plp extension for UMS players or .pla for MTP
       players.  The behavior when EasyH10 could not find a music file referred by a playlist can  be  specified
       with options <b>-g</b>, <b>-f</b>, and <b>-k</b>.  Do not put two or more playlist files sharing the same file name to avoid a
       collision of converted playlist files.

       <u>Location</u>  specifies  the  path  to  the root directory where an H10 player is mounted as an external HDD.
       Three important directories,  the  database  directory,  music  directory,  and  playlist  directory  are
       determined  automatically  as relative paths from the root directory.  As for these directories, refer to
       the description for options <b>-d</b>, <b>-m</b>, and <b>-r</b> that configure the default values.

       A model template must be specified for EasyH10 to identify the model of  the  iriver  H10  player  to  be
       managed.   EasyH10  assumes a default template (<b>easyh10.model</b>) to be placed in the current directory, the
       root directory of the player, <b>easyh10/model</b> directory from the player root directory, etc.   As  for  the
       complete  list  of  directories  for  the  default template, refer to the description of option <b>-t</b>, which
       specifies a model template manually.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Database</b> <b>construction</b> <b>options:</b>
       <b>-C,</b> <b>--construct</b>
              Discard an existing database and construct a new one from music  files  located  under  the  music
              directory.   EasyH10  enumerates all MP3/WMA/WAV files in the music directories, obtains the media
              information (e.g., title name, artist name, album name, genre name, track number, bitrate,  sample
              rate, etc.) from the found files, and generates a set of database files in the database directory.

       <b>-U,</b> <b>--update</b>
              Update  a  media  database from music files located under the music directory. EasyH10 obtains the
              media information from files that have been updated or added since the last database construction.

       <b>-o,</b> <b>--order=TYPE</b>
              Choose a playback and displaying order in the MUSIC mode.  Selecting an order except  for  <b>default</b>
              inserts  a  space  just  before  track  titles.   This space is a special character to control the
              playback order, but you may not notice it because the player uses a proportional font by default.

              <b>d,</b> <b>default</b>
                     Leave the player to arrange music tracks in a default order  determined  by  the  firmware.
                     EasyH10 will not make any attempt to change the playback order.  The playback order will be
                     the  same  as  that created by iriver plus and Windows Media Player 10.  If you have an H10
                     player running on UMS 2.04 firmware, the playback order will be a numerical order of  track
                     numbers.

              <b>t,</b> <b>tracktitle</b>
                     Force  an  alphabetical order of track titles.  This order is useful if you added the track
                     number at the head of each track name (e.g., "01 song name").

              <b>f,</b> <b>filename</b>
                     Force an alphabetical order of file names.  This order is useful if  you  added  the  track
                     number at the head of each file name (e.g., "01_songname.mp3").

              <b>n,</b> <b>tracknumber</b>
                     Force  a  numerical  order of track numbers.  The track number must be associated with each
                     music file.  This order is the most recommended option if you want to listen to  the  music
                     as if you listened to a CD.  It arranges music tracks in a numerical order of track numbers
                     even when entering all-tracks-by-an-artist navigation.

              <b>c,</b> <b>complete</b>
                     Force  a  random  order  (shuffle)  for  any cases.  The iRiver H10 player will turn into a
                     shuffle-only player.

              <b>a,</b> <b>album</b>
                     Force a random order when playing music tracks in an album and  numerical  order  of  track
                     numbers when entering all-tracks-by-an-artist or all-tracks-with-a-genre navigation.

              <b>l,</b> <b>all</b> Force  a  random  order  when  playing all titles and numerical order of track numbers when
                     playing music tracks in an album.

       <b>-z,</b> <b>--source=METHOD</b>
              Specify a method for obtaining media information.  This option was introduced for users  who  want
              to  make use of directory layout rather than tag information.  EasyH10 provides nine templates for
              specifying the source from which the music information is obtained.

              <b>m</b>      Tag information in music files (DEFAULT).  This is the recommended option  if  the  tag  is
                     written into music files properly.

              <b>[g]p</b>   Parse  path names to obtain (genres and) artists.  This template assumes directories in the
                     music directory to represent artist names.  Other fields (i.e.,  album  name,  genre  name,
                     track title, and track number) are extracted from the tag.

              <b>[g]pa</b>  Parse path names to obtain (genres,) artists, albums.  This template assumes directories in
                     the  music  directory to represent artist names and directory names from artist directories
                     to represent album names.  A path letter <b>'/'</b> in the album directories are replaced  with  a
                     space.  Other fields are extracted from the tag.

              <b>[g]pa[n]t</b>
                     Parse  path  names  to  obtain  (genres,)  artists,  and albums; parse file names to obtain
                     (numbers and) titles.  This template assumes  file  names  to  represent  track  titles  in
                     addition  to <b>[g]pa</b> template.  Specifying <b>n</b> assumes two letters at the head of file names to
                     represent track numbers.  It skips space and '_' letters followed  by  the  two  digits  to
                     extract track titles.

   <b>Playlist</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>options:</b>
       <b>-P,</b> <b>--playlist</b>
              Convert playlist files in the playlist directory.  Setting this option converts M3U/M3U8/PLS files
              located in the playlist directory and writes respective PLA/PLP playlist files.

       <b>-M,</b> <b>--music</b>
              Convert  playlist files in the music directories.  Setting this option converts M3U/M3U8/PLS files
              located under the music directories (including  sub-directories)  and  writes  respective  PLA/PLP
              files to the playlist directory.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--reconvert</b>
              Overwrite the existing PLP/PLA playlist files to force conversion.

       <b>-g,</b> <b>--guess-missing</b>
              Guess  path  names of missing music files in a playlist.  Setting this option tries to correct the
              location of music files referred by a playlist by trying a possible combinations of  the  path  to
              the music folder and path to the music file referred by the playlist.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--find-missing</b>
              Find  path  names  of missing music files in a playlist.  Setting this option tries to correct the
              location of a music file referred by a playlist by searching for  the  music  file  in  the  music
              directories  that  have  the same file name.  Finding two or more music files that have the target
              file name, EasyH10 selects a music file with a path name that is the most similar to the  original
              one.

       <b>-k,</b> <b>--skip-missing</b>
              Skip  missing  music  files  in a playlist.  Setting this option indicates EasyH10 to continue the
              playlist conversion only with music files found in the H10 player.  The  default  behavior  for  a
              missing music file is to cancel the conversion for the playlist.

       <b>-x,</b> <b>--regex-playlist</b>
              Enable  Regular  Expression  Playlist (REP).  Regular Expression Playlist (REP) is a kind of smart
              playlist based on path/file names.  EasyH10  generates  a  playlist  with  music  files  that  are
              supported  by  the  H10  player  and  match  the condition(s) described in *.rep file.  If a music
              collection  has  the  folder  structure  with  (genre,)  artist,  and  album  names,  EasyH10  can
              automatically  create a playlist with all tracks in the player, by a specific artist, or by a more
              complicated condition.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--auto-shuffle</b>
              Shuffle music files in [(name).sfl*.(ext)] playlists.  If  a  playlist  filename  contains  ".sfl"
              substring  just  before  an  extension  (e.g.,  hoge.sfl.m3u,  fuga.sfl.pls, all.sfl.rep), EasyH10
              automatically randomizes the order of music tracks referred by  the  playlist.   In  other  words,
              EasyH10  users  can  create  a  random  playlist  only if they name it as "(name).sfl.(extension)"
              pattern.

   <b>Tuner</b> <b>preset</b> <b>options:</b>
       <b>-I,</b> <b>--import-tuner=FN</b>
              Import a tuner preset from a file. EasyH10 will discard the existing preset in the player  without
              -a (--merge-tuner) option.

       <b>-E,</b> <b>--export-tuner=FN</b>
              Export  the  current tuner preset to a file. EasyH10 will discard the existing preset in the local
              file without -a (--merge-tuner) option.

       <b>-a,</b> <b>--merge-tuner</b>
              Merge the current tuner preset with a file.

   <b>H10</b> <b>Player</b> <b>model</b> <b>options:</b>
       <b>-t,</b> <b>--model=MODEL</b>
              Specify a model template.  EasyH10 uses this file to identify an iRiver H10  model.   By  default,
              model  template  files  are  copied  into <b>${PREFIX}/share/easyh10/model</b> by the installer.  You may
              specify one of these template files.  If no model template is specified, EasyH10 finds  a  default
              template    (<b>easyh10.model</b>)   in   the   following   directory/order:   the   current   directory;
              <b>${H10ROOT}/easyh10/model</b>; <b>${H10ROOT}/model</b>; and <b>${H10ROOT}</b>.  Therefore, you may  copy  a  template
              file to these locations so that EasyH10 will read it automatically.

       <b>--gen-model=MODEL,FW_MIN_VERSION,FW_MAX_VERSION</b>
              Create  a  model template from an existing database.  This option is only for EasyH10 developpers.
              Do not use this option.

       <b>-X,</b> <b>--install-model</b>
              Install the model template specified by -t option into the player. This will make a  copy  of  the
              template file as <b>${H10ROOT}/easyh10.model</b>.

   <b>H10</b> <b>location</b> <b>options:</b>
       <b>-s,</b> <b>--systempath=SYSTEM</b>
              Specify the path to the system files.  This option overwrites the default value <b>${H10ROOT}/System</b>.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--dbpath=DATABASE</b>
              Specify    the   path   to   the   database.    This   option   overwrites   the   default   value
              <b>${H10ROOT}/System/DATA</b>.

       <b>-m,</b> <b>--musicpath=MUSIC</b>
              Specify  the  path  to  the   music   files.    This   option   overwrites   the   default   value
              <b>${H10ROOT}/Media/Music</b> for UMS players or <b>${H10ROOT}/Music</b> for MTP players.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--playlistpath=PLAYLIST</b>
              Specify   the   path   to   the   playlist  files.   This  option  overwrites  the  default  value
              <b>${H10ROOT}/Media/Playlist</b> for UMS players or <b>${H10ROOT}/Playlists</b> for MTP players.

   <b>Language-specific</b> <b>options:</b>
       <b>-e,</b> <b>--encoding=SE</b>
              Specify a character encoding used by the operating system.  EasyH10 converts path/file names  from
              the  specified  encoding  into UCS-2 using iconv.  The default value is determined by an automatic
              detection of the system character-encoding.

       <b>-w,</b> <b>--tagencoding=TE</b>
              Specify a character encoding for parsing non-unicode  tags.   EasyH10  converts  non-unicode  tags
              embedded in ID3v1, ID3v2, and Riff WAVE into UCS- using iconv.  The default value is ISO-8859-1.

       <b>-b,</b> <b>--bidi</b>
              Store  the  field  values  in the database so that the player can display Hebrew strings correctly
              (experimental).

   <b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>options:</b>
       <b>-D,</b> <b>--dump</b>
              Output a database dump in plain text format.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Show version number and exit.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Show this help message and exit.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Verbose mode.

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b></h4><pre>
       It is recommended to copy a firmware model template to the root of the device in order to avoid having to
       specify the firmware every time the tool is used. The following example is for the International  version
       of the 5 GB player.

       <b>cp</b> <b>/usr/share/easyh10/model/H10Intl_5GB_FW2.04-2.05.model</b> <b>/mnt/usbdisk/easyh10.model</b>

       (Depending   on   your   installation   method,   the   .model   files  may  be  in  /usr/share/easyh10/,
       /usr/local/share/easyh10/ or /usr/local/share/easyh10/model/)

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>easyh10</b> <b>-C</b> <b>-on</b> <b>/mnt/usbdisk</b>
              Rebuild a media database with track-number ordering for the H10 player mounted on <b>/mnt/usbdisk</b>.

       <b>easyh10</b> <b>-U</b> <b>-ol</b> <b>-PMrf</b> <b>/mnt/usbdisk</b>
              Update   a   media   database   with   all-shuffle   ordering.   Reconvert   playlist   files   in
              <b>/mnt/usbdisk/Media/Music</b> and <b>/mnt/usbdisk/Media/Playlist/*</b> into respective PLP playlist files.
