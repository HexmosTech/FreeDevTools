       bladeRF-install-firmware - BladeRF Firmware Utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bladeRF-install-firmware</b>    [<u>-h</u>]   [<u>show</u>   <u>help</u>]   [<u>-i</u>   <u>imagedir</u>]   [<u>image_directory</u>]   [<u>-f</u>   <u>fpgaimage</u>]
       [<u>fpkg_image_file</u>] [<u>-u</u> <u>usbimage</u>] [<u>fx3_image_file</u>]

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This program works best without any arguments. If you already have the firmware tarball and  are  wanting
       to  install  it  on  a  system without Internet access, then you can run this script with that file as an
       argument.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The FPGA image is built using non-free software and is not distributed by Debian. This program  makes  it
       easier for the end user to get recommended images from Nuand.com.

       The bladeRF-cli application is used to load the FX3 firmware and the FPGA firmware.

       The  FX3  firmware  only  needs to be loaded once: it is stored in flash, and survives power cycling. The
       FPGA image needs to be loaded every time.

       Recommended  firmware  and  FPGA  images  to  use:  FX3  Image:  https://nuand.com/fx3/latest.img   FPGA:
       https://nuand.com/fpga
