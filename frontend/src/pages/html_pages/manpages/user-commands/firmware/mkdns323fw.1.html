</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mkdns323fw - build firmware images for the DNS-323 from a kernel and initrd

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mkdns323fw</b> -k KERNEL -i INITRD [-d DEFAULTS] -p PRODUCT_ID -c CUSTOM_ID -m MODEL_ID -o OUTPUTFILE

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       mkdns323fw  creates  firmware images suitable for upload to the D-link DNS-323 and other, similar devices
       based on the same basic firmware image, such as the Conceptronics CH3SNAS.  These firmware images contain
       a kernel and initrd, as well as various product-specific values and checksums.

       This command can be very dangerous; although it attempts to do some very, very basic sanity checking,  it
       is  still  quite  easy to generate a firmware file that, when loaded into your device, will kill it stone
       dead.  This program is not able to check that you're uploading valid data to your device;  if  you  brick
       it, you're on your own.

       <b>-k</b> kernel, <b>--kernel</b>=<u>kernel</u>

              specify the file containing the kernel image to embed in the firmware image.  This must be a uBoot
              image  file,  as  produced by <b><a href="../man1/mkimage.1.html">mkimage</a></b>(1) with appropriate options to specify it as a kernel image.
              Attempts to provide a non-uBoot file will fail, while specifying a non-kernel uBoot file may  well
              brick your device.  This option is required.

       <b>-i</b> initrd, <b>--initrd</b>=<u>initrd</u>

              the  initrd  file to embed in the firmware image.  This must be a uBoot image file, as produced by
              <b><a href="../man1/mkimage.1.html">mkimage</a></b>(1) with appropriate options to specify it as a ramdisk.  The tool will refuse to  embed  a
              non-uBoot file, however a dodgy ramdisk will likely brick your device.

       <b>-d</b> defaults.tar.gz, <b>--defaults</b>=<u>defaults.tar.gz</u>

              The  firmware  format has the ability to embed a tarball with a default configuration; if you want
              to do this, you may use this option to do so.  However, the devices that the author has dealt with
              do not require such a thing, and leaving it out still produces a valid firmware (and one that is a
              bit smaller, to boot).

       <b>-s</b> signature, <b>--defaults</b>=<u>signature</u>

              For reasons that will probably remain unknown until the ends of time, there  are  (at  least)  two
              different  firmware  signatures  running  around  that  are  otherwise identical in their internal
              structure, which are used for different devices.  This option exists to allow you to  specify  the
              signature that you want to use in your firmware build.  Valid values for this option are currently
              <u>FrodoII</u> ®(the default if this option is not specified), <u>Chopper</u> ®or <u>Gandolf</u> ®which is used in some
              devices.   See  the  table  at the top of the script if you don't know which value to use for your
              device.

       <b>--p</b> <b>product_id</b>, <b>--product-id</b>=<u>product_id</u>

       <b>--c</b> <b>custom_id</b>, <b>--custom-id</b>=<u>custom_id</u>

       <b>--m</b> <b>model_id</b>, <b>--model-id</b>=<u>model_id</u>

              Specify the product, custom, and model ID that this firmware image is intended  for.   As  several
              different  devices  share  the  same firmware format, the intended device type is encoded in these
              fields.  If you do not specify the correct values for the device that you are targetting with your
              firmware, it is quite likely that the device will refuse the upload.

              Known-good values for various devices are provided in the header of the script; please look  there
              for more information.  You can also obtain the values you need by downloading an existing firmware
              for the device you're targetting and doing a bit of digging.

       <b>-o</b> outputfile, <b>--output</b>=<u>outputfile</u>

              Where to write the completed firmware image.  Will overwrite any existing file of the same name.
