       int6kf - INT6300 Flash Utility for Linux

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>int6kf</b> [<u>options</u>] <b>-C</b> <u>file</u> <b>-N</b> <u>file</u> <b>-P</b> <u>file</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program is deprecated.  Use <b>int6kboot</b> when downloading firmware 3.3.4 or later on INT6300 devices or
       later.

       Download  and  start  runtime firmware on a local Atheros powerline device that is in bootloader mode.  A
       device stays in bootloader mode when it cannot load firmware from NVRAM.  That can happen  because  there
       is  no  NVRAM  or  because  the NVRAM is blank or corrupted.  The bootloader only understands a subset of
       Atheros message types and cannot flash NVRAM.  This program uses that subset to download runtime firmware
       and start execution.  Optionally, it will proceed to flash NVRAM after the firmware has started.

       Booting a device is a two part operation.  The first part downloads SDRAM configuration  parameters  then
       download  runtime  firmware and parameters into SDRAM and starts the firmware.  The second part downloads
       runtime firmare and parameters (again) into scratch buffers and instructs the firmware to write them into
       to NVRAM.  This program can perform the first part alone or the first then the second part  but  not  the
       second part alone.  The second part can be performed alone using program <b>int6k</b>.

       This  program  is  part  of  the  Atheros  Powerline  Toolkit.   See the <b>AMP</b> man page for compilation and
       installation instructions.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -<b>a</b>     Wait until device sends a VS_HOST_ACTION.IND before downloading SDRAM configuration, firmware  and
              PIB.

       -<b>C</b> <u>filename</u>
              Read  the named SDRAM configuration file and write it to the device.  This option and argument are
              required.  Any file having an invalid SDRAM  configuration  file  format  will  be  rejected.   No
              assumptions are made based on filename and no filename conventions are enforced.

       -<b>e</b>     Redirects  stderr  messages  to  stdout.   By  convention status and error messages are printed on
              stderr while primary program output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout
              in cases where this is desired.

       -<b>F</b>[<b>F</b>]  Write previously downloaded MAC and PIB to NVRAM using VS_MOD_NVM.  Adding  a  second  <b>F</b>  here  or
              another  <b>-F</b>  anywhere  on  the command line will <b>force-flash</b> a blank or corrupted NVRAM.  Firmware
              loaded from NVRAM will treat force-flash as an error.  This option can be used to  create  factory
              settings  but  cannot  be  used  to  change them once created.  Subsequent use creates and updates
              operational settings that can be erased using a factory reset.  This option is executed after  all
              others on the command line, except for the <b>-R</b> option.

       -<b>i</b> <u>interface</u>
              Select  the  host  Ethernet interface.  All requests are sent via this interface and only reponses
              received via this interface are recognized.  The default interface is <b>eth1</b> because most people use
              <b>eth0</b> as their principle network connection; however, if environment string "PLC" is  defined  then
              it  takes  precedence  over  the default interface.  This option then takes precedence over either
              default.

       -<b>N</b> <u>filename</u>
              Read the named NVM file and write it to the device.  This option and argument are  required.   Any
              file  having  an  invalid  NVM  file  format  will  be rejected.  No assumptions are made based on
              filename and no filename conventions are enforced.

       -<b>P</b> <u>filename</u>
              Read the named PIB file and write it to the device.  This option and argument are  required.   Any
              file  having  an  invalid  PIB  file  format  will  be rejected.  No assumptions are made based on
              filename and no filename conventions are enforced.

       -<b>q</b>     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -<b>t</b> <u>timer</u>
              Read timeout or capture period in milliseconds.  Values range from 0 through UINT_MAX.  This value
              has different effects on Linux and Windows.  On Linux, where native raw sockets are used, this  is
              the  maximum  time  allowed for a response and so larger values should not affect performance.  On
              Windows, where WinPcap is used, this is the time allotted for packet capture and so larger  values
              will certainly affect performance.  The default is shown in brackets on the program menu.

       -<b>v</b>     Prints  additional  information  on  stdout.   In  particular, this option dumps outgoing Ethernet
              packets on stdout.

       -<b>?</b>,--<b>help</b>
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence  over  other  options  on  the
              command line.

       -<b>!</b>,--<b>version</b>
              Print  program  version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on
              the command line.  Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so  that
              they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>REFERENCES</b></h4><pre>
       See the Atheros HomePlug AV Firmware Technical Reference Manual for more information.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>-C</b>, <b>-N</b> and <b>-P</b> options are always required.  Their order is not important.  Notice that no MAC address
       is  needed because devices use address 00:B0:52:00:00:01, the program default address, when in bootloader
       mode.

          int6kf -C test.cfg -N test.nvm -P test.pib
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write SDRAM Configuration
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write to device memory
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write to device memory
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Start Firmware
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Started.

       Downloads SDRAM configuration file <b>test.cfg</b> with VS_SET_SDRAM  then  firmware  from  file  <b>test.nvm</b>  with
       VS_WR_MEM  then  PIB from file <b>test.pib</b> then starts firmware execution with VS_ST_MAC.  This operation is
       common on flash-less systems.

          int6kf -C test.cfg -N test.nvm -P test.pib -F
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write SDRAM Configuration
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write to device memory
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write to device memory
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Start Firmware
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Started.
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write MAC as module
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write PIB as module
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Flash Device
          &gt; eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Flashed.

       Perform the same actions as before with some extra steps.  After starting firmware  execution,  the  same
       firmware  and  PIB are downloaded again, using VS_WR_MOD instead of VS_WR_MEM, and written to NVRAM using
       VS_MOD_NVM with force.  The force option is only recognized by firmware that  has  been  started  by  the
       bootloader and will fail when no flash memory is present.
