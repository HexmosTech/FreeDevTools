</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fwts - a firmware test suite to identify firmware bugs.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fwts</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>test(s)</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual page documents briefly the <b>fwts</b> firmware test suite.  The tool <b>fwts</b> is comprised of over 150
       tests that are designed to examine and test different aspects of PC firmware. Many of  these  tests  need
       super  user  access to extract tables and interact with the firmware and ACPI, so running <b>fwts</b> using sudo
       is required.
       Running <b>fwts</b> with no options will run through all the batch  tests  that  require  no  user  interaction.
       However, one can select just specific tests to run if required.

       By  default <b>fwts</b> outputs the test results into the log file <b>results.log</b> however a different log file name
       can be specified and if required, output to stderr or stdout can be selected.

       Note that there a variety of tests, including tests that can  potentially  hang  a  machine  (such  as  a
       suspend/hibernate/resume).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       fwts options are as follow:

       <b>-</b>      output results to stdout.

       <b>--acpica</b>
              enable  ACPICA  execution mode options. These can be specified as a comma separated list of one or
              more options. Available options are: serialized (serialized execution of AML), slack (run in  less
              pedeantic  mode),  ignore-errors  (ignore  ACPICA  exception errors), disable-auto-repair (disable
              ACPICA from automatically fixing broken ACPICA controls).  Note that the slack mode will  turn  on
              implicit  returns  of zero on control methods to attempt to allow buggy AML to work on non-Windows
              systems.

       <b>--acpica-debug</b>
              enable ACPICA debug warning and error messages when invoking the ACPICA subsystem. This is  mainly
              for fwts developers to help track down any ACPICA interfacing issues with fwts.

       <b>--acpicompliance</b>
              run only those tests that specifically check for compliance with the ACPI specifications. This may
              be a subset of the ACPI tests.

       <b>--acpitests</b>
              run all general ACPI tests.

       <b>-a,</b> <b>--all</b>
              run all the tests.

       <b>--arch=name</b>
              specify  the  target  architecture  whose firmware is being tested. This allows fwts to run on one
              architecture (the host) but perform  tests  for  a  different  architecture  (the  target).  Known
              architecture strings are: x86, x86_32, or x86_64 for Intel; ia64 for Itanium; arm64 or aarch64 for
              ARMv8. Unless this option is specified, the target is assumed to be the same as the host.

       <b>-b,</b> <b>--batch</b>
              run the non-interactive batch tests. Batch tests require no user interaction.

       <b>--batch-experimental</b>
              run only batch experimental tests.

       <b>--clog</b> specify a coreboot logfile dump.

       <b>--disassemble-aml</b>
              disassemble  AML  (ACPI  machine language) byte code. This attempts to disassemble AML in DSDT and
              SSDT tables and generates DSDT.dsl and SSDTx.dsl sources.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--dump</b>
              extracts firmware data and dumps it into log files. This generates:
              acpidump.log - containing a hex dump of the ACPI tables (which can be read using acpixtract).
              dmesg.log - containing the current kernel log messages.
              dmidecode.log - containing the output from dmidecode.
              lspci.log - containing the output from lspci -vv -nn
              cpuinfo.log - containing the output from cat <a href="file:/proc/cpuinfo">/proc/cpuinfo</a>
              README.txt - containing a timestamp and kernel version information.

       <b>--dump-acpi-from-sysfs</b>
              specify dumping acpi table log default from sysfs.

       <b>--dumpfile=acpidump.log</b>
              load ACPI tables from output generated from acpidump or from  sudo  fwts  --dump.  The  latter  is
              preferred as fwts --dump is able to dump more tables than acpidump. This allows one to dump tables
              from one machine and processes them with fwts on another machine.

       <b>--ebbr</b> run ARM EBBR tests.

       <b>--uefi-get-var-multiple</b>
              specifies the number of times to get a variable in the uefirtvariable get variable stress test.

       <b>--uefi-set-var-multiple</b>
              specifies the number of times to set a variable in the uefirtvariable set variable stress test.

       <b>--uefi-query-var-multiple</b>
              specifies  the  number  of  times  to query a variable in the uefirtvariable query variable stress
              test.

       <b>--uefitests</b>
              run all general UEFI tests.

       <b>--filter-error-discard</b>
              specifies the errors that one wants to silently ignore. One supplies a comma sperated list of fwts
              error message labels that one wants fwts to not report as errors. fwts will run the  test  but  if
              there  is  a  test failure and the label matches the one supplied in this list fwts will then just
              ignore this error. This cannot be used with --filter-error-keep.

       <b>--filter-error-keep</b>
              specifies the errors that one wants to keep, all other errors are silently ignored.  One  supplies
              a  comma  sperated  list  of fwts error message labels that one wants fwts report as errors, other
              test  failures  will  be  not  reported  and  silently  ignored.   This  cannot   be   used   with
              --filter-error-discard.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--force-clean</b>
              creates a new results log file, rather than just appending to any existing one (default).

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              outputs the internal help page.

       <b>-i,</b> <b>--interactive</b>
              run the interactive tests. These tests require user interaction.

       <b>--ifv</b>  run tests in firmware-vendor modes.

       <b>--interactive-experimental</b>
              run only interactive experimental tests.

       <b>-j,</b> <b>--json-data-path</b>
              specifies  the  path to the fwts json data files. These files contain json formatted configuration
              tables, for example klog scanning patterns.

       <b>-k,</b> <b>--klog=file</b>
              read the kernel log from the specified file rather than from the  kernel  log  ring  buffer.  This
              allows one to run the kernel log scanning tests such as klog against pre-gathered log data.

       <b>--log-fields</b>
              show the available log filtering fields. Specifying these fields with --log-filter to select which
              fields one wants to log.

       <b>--log-filter</b>
              specify  which  particular types of log data to be output into the log file. Each line of log data
              is tagged with a special marker depending on what type of log information  is  being  output.  The
              available  types  can  be  see  by  using  --log-fields.  Specify the desired log types with comma
              separated list. To disable a field, prefix the name with ~, for example:
              --log-filter=RES,SUM  logs just the results and summary lines.
              --log-filter=ALL,~INF  logs all lines except for the information lines.

       <b>--log-format</b>
              specify the information in each log line. The following specifiers are available:
              %date  - date
              %time  - time
              %field - log-filter fields
              %owner - name of the test routine
              %level - test failure level
              %line  - log line
              e.g. --log-format="%date %time [%field] (%owner): "

       <b>--log-level</b> <b>[critical|high|medium|low|info|all]</b>
              specify the test failure level to log. Test failure levels equal to and higher than the  specified
              are  logged  and  recorded  as  failures. The default is 'all' (which is identical to 'info'). For
              example, a log level of 'medium' will just  log  test  failures  of  level  'medium',  'high'  and
              'critical', where as a log level of 'critical' will just log 'critical' level failures.

       <b>--log-type</b>
              specify the log type. Currently plaintext, json and xml log types are available and the default is
              plaintext.

       <b>--lspci=path</b>
              specify the full path and filename to the the lspci binary.

       <b>-P,</b> <b>--power-states</b>
              run S3 and S4 power state tests (s3, s4 tests)

       <b>--results-no-separators</b>
              no pretty printing of horizontal separators in the results log file.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--results-output=filename</b>
              specify  the results output log file.  One can also specify stdout and stderr to redirect to these
              output streams.

       <b>-R,</b> <b>--rsdp=physaddr</b>
              specify the physical address of ACPI RSDP. This is useful on  some  systems  where  it  cannot  be
              automatically detected.

       <b>--pm-method=method</b>
              specify  the  power method to use to enter S3 or S4 (or autodetection will be used). The following
              specifiers are available:
              logind   - the default method, where available (requires dbus and logind).
              pm-utils - the previous default method, now deprecated.
              sysfs    - the fallback, used when logind is not available.
              e.g. --pm-method=sysfs

       <b>--s3-delay-delta=N</b>
              time to be added onto delay between each S3 iteration.

       <b>--s3-device-check</b>
              check differences between device configurations over a S3 cycle. Note this adds 15  seconds  delay
              after each s3 resume to allow wifi to re-associate.

       <b>--s3-device-check-delay</b>
              specify  the  time  to  wait  while  devices  re-configure (e.g. wifi to re-associate, ethernet to
              connect..)  before a device configuration check is run. The default is 15 seconds. If this  option
              is  used  the  device  checking  is assumed so one does not also need to use the --s3-device-check
              flag.

       <b>--s3-hybrid</b>
              enables fwts to run Hybrid Sleep.

       <b>--s3-min-delay=N</b>
              minimum time between S3 iterations.

       <b>--s3-max-delay=N</b>
              maximum time between S3 iterations.

       <b>--s3-multiple=N</b>
              specified the number of multiple S3 suspend/resume tests to run. The default is 2 tests.

       <b>--s3-resume-hook=hookscript</b>
              specifies a script or program to run after each  S3  resume.  The  hookscript  must  return  0  to
              indicate  success,  or  non-zero  to  indicate  failure.  Failures  will  abort subsequent S3 test
              iterations.

       <b>--s3-quirks=--quirk[,--quirk]</b>
              specify  a  comma  separated  list  of  quirk  arguments  to  pass  to  pm-suspend,  for  example:
              --s3-quirks=--quirk-s3-bios,--quirk-save-pci

       <b>--s3-sleep-delay=N</b>
              sleep  N  seconds  from  the  start of the suspend to the wakeup time. Note that this time MUST be
              longer than the time it takes to suspend the machine otherwise the wakeup timer will  fire  during
              the suspend state. The default is 30 seconds.

       <b>--s3-suspend-time=N</b>
              specify  the  maximum  allowed  suspend time in seconds. If suspend takes longer than this then an
              error is logged.

       <b>--s3-resume-time=N</b>
              specify the maximum allowed resume time in seconds. If resume takes longer than this then an error
              is logged.

       <b>--s3power-sleep-delay=N</b>
              specify the suspend duration in seconds. The higher the value the more accurate the  s3power  test
              result.  Durations less than 10 minutes are not recommended.

       <b>--s4-delay-delta=N</b>
              time to be added onto delay between each S4 iteration.

       <b>--s4-device-check</b>
              check  differences  between device configurations over a S4 cycle. Note this adds 15 seconds delay
              after each s3 resume to allow wifi to re-associate.

       <b>--s4-device-check-delay</b>
              specify the time to wait while devices  re-configure  (e.g.  wifi  to  re-associate,  ethernet  to
              connect..)   before a device configuration check is run. The default is 15 seconds. If this option
              is used the device checking is assumed so one does not also  need  to  use  the  --s4-device-check
              flag.

       <b>--s4-min-delay=N</b>
              minimum time between S4 iterations.

       <b>--s4-max-delay=N</b>
              maximum time between S4 iterations.

       <b>--s4-multiple=N</b>
              specified the number of multiple S4 hibernate/resume tests to run. The default is 2 tests.

       <b>--s4-quirks=--quirk[,--quirk]</b>
              specify  a  comma  separated  list  of  quirk  arguments  to  pass  to  pm-hibernate, for example:
              --s4-quirks=--quirk-save-pci

       <b>--s4-sleep-delay=N</b>
              sleep N seconds from the start of the hibernate to the wakeup time. Note that this  time  MUST  be
              longer than the time it takes to hibernate the machine otherwise the wakeup timer will fire during
              the hibernate state. The default is currently 90 seconds.

       <b>--sbbr</b> run ARM SBBR tests

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--show-progress</b>
              show  the  progress of the tests being run. Each test will identified as it is being run. For long
              tests, a percentage of completion time will be displayed. As of fwts 0.19.06 this  is  enabled  by
              default and can be disabled with --quiet (or -q).

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b>
              run quietly with no output to stdout.

       <b>-D,</b> <b>--show-progress-dialog</b>
              output  the  progress of tests being run in a form that can be piped into the dialog tool with the
              --gauge option.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--show-tests</b>
              show the names of available tests. By default will show all tests. Use the --batch, --interactive,
              --batch-experimental, --interactive-experimental, --utils options to show these specific tests.

       <b>--show-tests-full</b>
              show all the available tests listed by minor test description. By default will show all tests. Use
              the --batch, --interactive, --batch-experimental, --interactive-experimental options to show these
              specific tests.

       <b>--show-tests-categories</b>
              show all the available tests and the categories they belong to.

       <b>--skip-test=test[,test..]</b>
              specify tests to skip over and not run. List must be comma separated.

       <b>--stdout-summary</b>
              output SUCCESS or FAILED to stdout at end of tests.

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--table-path=path</b>
              specify the  path  containing  ACPI  tables.  These  tables  need  to  be  named  in  the  format:
              tablename.dat,  for  example DSDT.dat, for example, as extracted using acpidump or fwts --dump and
              then acpixtract.

       <b>-u,</b> <b>--utils</b>
              run utilities. Designed to dump system information, such as annotated ACPI  tables,  CMOS  memory,
              Int 15 E820 memory map, firmware ROM data.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
              output version number and build date of the <b>fwts</b> tool.

       <b>-w,</b> <b>--width=N</b>
              specify the width in characters of the output logfile. The default is 130.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Run all the batch tests and append the results into the default log results.log:
               sudo fwts

       Run all the interactive tests and start a clean results log called interactive.log:
               sudo fwts -i -f -r interactive.log

       Run all the tests, interactive and batch:
               sudo fwts -i -b

       Run just the battery and cpufreq tests:
               sudo fwts battery cpufreq

       Run all the batch tests and define a new log format using just the date and line number:
               sudo fwts --log-format="%date %line: "

       Run all the interactive tests and log just the results, info and summary data:
               sudo fwts -i --log-filter=RES,INF,SUM

       Dump all the interesting firmware information into log files for analysis later:
               sudo fwts --dump

       View kernel and ACPI driver version and BIOS information:
               sudo fwts  -w 80 -r stdout  version bios_info --log-filter=INF --log-format=""

       Show the batch and batch experimental tests:
               fwts --show-tests --batch --batch-experimental

       Run multiple S3 tests with delay between each test ranging from 1 second to 10 seconds with a delay delta
       per test of 0.2 seconds
               sudo fwts s3 --s3-multiple=100 --s3-min-delay=1 --s3-max-delay=10 --s3-delay-delta=0.2
