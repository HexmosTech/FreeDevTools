</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Inkscape</b> is a Free and open source vector graphics editor. It offers a rich set of features and is widely
       used for both artistic and technical illustrations such as cartoons, clip art, logos, typography,
       diagramming and flowcharting.  It uses vector graphics to allow for sharp printouts and renderings at
       unlimited resolution and is not bound to a fixed number of pixels like raster graphics. Inkscape uses the
       standardized <b>SVG</b> file format as its main format, which is supported by many other applications including
       web browsers.

       The interface is designed to be comfortable and efficient for skilled users, while remaining conformant
       to <b>GNOME</b> standards so that users familiar with other GNOME applications can learn its interface rapidly.

       <b>SVG</b> is a W3C standard XML format for 2D vector drawing. It allows defining objects in the drawing using
       points, paths, and primitive shapes.  Colors, fonts, stroke width, and so forth are specified as `style'
       attributes to these objects.  The intent is that since SVG is a standard, and since its files are
       text/xml, it will be possible to use SVG files in a sizeable number of programs and for a wide range of
       uses.

       <b>Inkscape</b> uses SVG as its native document format, and has the goal of becoming the most fully compliant
       drawing program for SVG files available in the Open Source community.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
               Shows a help message.

       <b>--help-all</b>
               Shows all help options.

       <b>--help-gapplication</b>
               Shows the GApplication options.

       <b>--help-gtk</b>
               Shows the GTK+ options.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
               Shows the Inkscape version and build date.

       <b>--debug-info</b>
               Prints  technical  information  including  Inkscape  version,  dependency  versions and operating
               system.  This Information is useful when debugging issues with Inkscape and  should  be  included
               whenever filing a bug report.

       <b>--system-data-directory</b>
               Prints  the  system  data  directory  where  data  files that ship with Inkscape are stored. This
               includes files which Inkscape requires to run (like unit definitions, built-in  key  maps,  files
               describing  UI  layout,  icon  themes,  etc.),  core extensions, stock resources (filters, fonts,
               markers, color palettes, symbols, templates) and documentation (SVG example files, tutorials).

               The location in which Inkscape expects the system data  directory  can  be  overridden  with  the
               INKSCAPE_DATADIR environment variable.

       <b>--user-data-directory</b>
               Prints  the  user  profile  directory  where user-specific data files and preferences are stored.
               Custom extensions and resources (filters, fonts, markers,  color  palettes,  symbols,  templates)
               should be installed into their respective subdirectories in this directory. In addition placing a
               file  with  a  name  identical  to  one in the system data directory here allows to override most
               presets from the system data directory (e.g. default templates, UI files, etc.).

               The default location of the profile directory can be  overridden  with  the  INKSCAPE_PROFILE_DIR
               environment variable.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--pipe</b>
               Reads input file from standard input (stdin).

       <b>--pdf-page</b>=<u>PAGE</u>
               Imports the given page of a pdf file. Numbering starts with 1.

       <b>--pdf-poppler</b>
               By  default Inkscape imports PDF files via an internal (poppler-derived) library.  Text is stored
               as text. Meshes are converted to tiles.  Use --pdf-poppler to import  via  an  external  (poppler
               with  cairo backend) library instead. Text consists of groups containing cloned glyphs where each
               glyph is a path.  Images are stored internally. Meshes cause entire document to be rendered as  a
               raster image.

       <b>--convert-dpi-method</b>=<u>METHOD</u>
               Choose  method  used  to rescale legacy (pre-0.92) files which render slightly smaller due to the
               switch from 90 DPI to 96 DPI when interpreting lengths expressed in  units  of  pixels.  Possible
               values  are "none" (no change, document will render at 94% of its original size), "scale-viewbox"
               (document will be rescaled globally, individual lengths will stay untouched) and "scale-document"
               (each length will be re-scaled individually).

       <b>--no-convert-text-baseline-spacing</b>
               Do not automatically fix text baselines in legacy (pre-0.92) files  on  opening.   Inkscape  0.92
               adopts  the  CSS  standard  definition  for  the  'line-height' property, which differs from past
               versions.  By default, the line height values in files created prior to  Inkscape  0.92  will  be
               adjusted  on  loading  to  preserve the intended text layout.  This command line option will skip
               that adjustment.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--export-filename</b>=<u>FILENAME</u>
               Sets the name of the output file. The default is to re-use  the  name  of  the  input  file.   If
               --export-type  is  also  used,  the  file  extension  will be adjusted (or added) as appropriate.
               Otherwise the file type to export will be inferred from the extension of the specified filename.

               Usage of the special filename "-"  makes  Inkscape  write  the  image  data  to  standard  output
               (stdout).

       <b>--export-overwrite</b>
               Overwrites input file.

       <b>--export-type</b>=<u>TYPE[,TYPE]*</u>
               Specify the file type to export. Possible values: svg, png, ps, eps, pdf, emf, wmf and every file
               type  for which an export extension exists. It is possible to export more than one file type at a
               time.

               Note that PostScript does not support transparency, so any transparent objects  in  the  original
               SVG will be automatically rasterized. Used fonts are subset and embedded. The default export area
               is page; you can set it to drawing by --export-area-drawing.

               Note that PDF format preserves the transparency in the original SVG.

       <b>--export-extension</b>=<u>EXTENSION-ID</u>
               Allows  to  specify  an  output  extension  that  will be used for exporting, which is especially
               relevant if there is more than one export option  for  a  given  file  type.  If  set,  the  file
               extension  in  --export-filename and --export-type may be omitted. Additionally, if set, only one
               file type may be given in --export-type.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--export-area-page</b>
               In SVG, PNG, PDF, PS exported area is the page. This is the default for SVG, PNG, PDF, and PS, so
               you don't need to specify this unless you are using --export-id to export a specific object.  For
               EPS this option is currently not supported.

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--export-area-drawing</b>
               In  SVG, PNG, PDF, PS, and EPS export, exported area is the drawing (not page), i.e. the bounding
               box of all objects of the document (or of the exported object if --export-id is used).  With this
               option, the exported image will display all the visible objects of the document  without  margins
               or cropping. This is the default export area for EPS. For PNG, it can be used in combination with
               --export-use-hints.

       <b>-a</b> <u>x0:y0:x1:y1</u>, <b>--export-area</b>=<u>x0:y0:x1:y1</u>
               In  PNG  export, set the exported area of the document, specified in px (1/96 in). The default is
               to export the entire document page. The point (0,0) is the lower-left corner.

       <b>--export-area-snap</b>
               For PNG export, snap the export area outwards to the nearest integer px values. If you are  using
               the  default  export  resolution  of  96  dpi  and  your  graphics  are pixel-snapped to minimize
               antialiasing, this switch allows you to preserve this alignment even if you  are  exporting  some
               object's  bounding  box  (with  --export-id  or --export-area-drawing) which is itself not pixel-
               aligned.

       <b>-d</b> <u>DPI</u>, <b>--export-dpi</b>=<u>DPI</u>
               The resolution used for PNG export.  It is also  used  for  fallback  rasterization  of  filtered
               objects when exporting to PS, EPS, or PDF (unless you specify --export-ignore-filters to suppress
               rasterization).  The  default  is  96  dpi, which corresponds to 1 SVG user unit (px, also called
               "user unit") exporting to 1 bitmap pixel.  This  value  overrides  the  DPI  hint  if  used  with
               --export-use-hints.

       <b>-w</b> <u>WIDTH</u>, <b>--export-width</b>=<u>WIDTH</u>
               The  width  of generated bitmap in pixels.  This value overrides the --export-dpi setting (or the
               DPI hint if used with --export-use-hints).

       <b>-h</b> <u>HEIGHT</u>, <b>--export-height</b>=<u>HEIGHT</u>
               The height of generated bitmap in pixels.  This value overrides the --export-dpi setting (or  the
               DPI hint if used with --export-use-hints).

       <b>--export-margin</b>=<u>MARGIN</u>
               Adds a margin around the exported area. The size of the margin is specified in units of page size
               (for  SVG)  or  millimeters  (for  PS/PDF).   The option currently has no effect for other export
               formats.

       <b>-i</b> <u>ID</u>, <b>--export-id</b>=<u>OBJECT-ID[;OBJECT-ID]*</u>
               For PNG, PS, EPS, PDF and plain SVG export, the id attribute value of the object(s) that you want
               to export from the document; all other objects are not exported.  By default the exported area is
               the bounding box of the  object;  you  can  override  this  using  --export-area  (PNG  only)  or
               --export-area-page.

               If  you specify many values with a semicolon separated list of objects, each one will be exported
               separately.   In   this   case    the    exported    files    will    be    named    this    way:
               [input_filename]_[ID].[export_type]

       <b>-j</b>, <b>--export-id-only</b>
               For PNG and plain SVG, only export the object whose id is given in --export-id. All other objects
               are  hidden  and  won't  show  in  export  even  if  they  overlay  the exported object.  Without
               --export-id, this option is ignored. For PDF export, this is the default, so this option  has  no
               effect.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--export-plain-svg</b>
               Export document(s) to plain SVG format, without sodipodi: or inkscape: namespaces and without RDF
               metadata. Use the --export-filename option to specify the filename.

       <b>--export-png-color-mode</b>=<u>COLORMODE</u>
               Sets    the    color    mode    (bit    depth    and    color    type)   for   exported   bitmaps
               (Gray_1/Gray_2/Gray_4/Gray_8/Gray_16/RGB_8/RGB_16/GrayAlpha_8/GrayAlpha_16/RGBA_8/RGBA_16)

       <b>--export-png-use-dithering</b>=<u>false|true</u>
               Forces dithering or disables it (the Inkscape build must support dithering for this).

       <b>--export-ps-level</b>=<u>LEVEL</u>
               Set language version for PS and EPS export. PostScript level 2 or 3 is supported. Default is 3.

       <b>--export-pdf-version</b>=<u>VERSION</u>
               Select the PDF version of the exported PDF file. This option basically exposes  the  PDF  version
               selector  found  in  the  PDF-export dialog of the GUI. You must provide one of the versions from
               that combo-box, e.g. "1.4". The default pdf export version is "1.4".

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--export-text-to-path</b>
               Convert text objects to paths on export, where applicable (for PS, EPS, PDF and SVG export).

       <b>--export-latex</b>
               (for PS, EPS, and PDF export) Used for creating images for LaTeX  documents,  where  the  image's
               text  is  typeset  by  LaTeX.  When exporting to PDF/PS/EPS format, this option splits the output
               into a PDF/PS/EPS file (e.g. as specified by --export-type) and a LaTeX file. Text  will  not  be
               output  in  the  PDF/PS/EPS  file,  but  instead  will  appear in the LaTeX file. This LaTeX file
               includes the PDF/PS/EPS. Inputting (\input{image.tex}) the LaTeX file in your LaTeX document will
               show the image and all text will be typeset by LaTeX. See  the  resulting  LaTeX  file  for  more
               information.  Also see GNUPlot's `epslatex' output terminal.

       <b>--export-ignore-filters</b>
               Export filtered objects (e.g. those with blur) as vectors, ignoring the filters (for PS, EPS, and
               PDF  export).   By default, all filtered objects are rasterized at --export-dpi (default 96 dpi),
               preserving the appearance.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--export-use-hints</b>
               While exporting to PNG, use export filename and DPI hints stored in  the  exported  object  (only
               with  --export-id).   These  hints  are  set  automatically when you export selection from within
               Inkscape.  So, for example, if you export a shape with id="path231" as /home/me/shape.png at  300
               dpi  from  document.svg using Inkscape GUI, and save the document, then later you will be able to
               reexport that shape to the same file with the same resolution simply with

                   inkscape -i path231 -t document.svg

               If you use --export-dpi, --export-width, or --export-height with this option, then the  DPI  hint
               will  be  ignored and the value from the command line will be used.  If you use --export-filename
               with this option, then the filename hint will be ignored and the filename from the  command  line
               will be used.

       <b>-b</b> <u>COLOR</u>, <b>--export-background</b>=<u>COLOR</u>
               Background  color  of  exported  PNG.   This  may  be any SVG supported color string, for example
               "#ff007f" or "rgb(255, 0, 128)".  If not set, then the page color set in Inkscape in the Document
               Properties dialog will be used (stored in the pagecolor= attribute of sodipodi:namedview).

       <b>-y</b> <u>VALUE</u>, <b>--export-background-opacity</b>=<u>VALUE</u>
               Opacity of the background of exported PNG.  This may be a value either between 0.0 and  1.0  (0.0
               meaning  full  transparency,  1.0  full  opacity)  or  greater than 1 up to 255 (255 meaning full
               opacity).  If not set and the -b option is not used, then the page opacity set in Inkscape in the
               Document Properties dialog will  be  used  (stored  in  the  inkscape:pageopacity=  attribute  of
               sodipodi:namedview).   If not set but the -b option is used, then the value of 255 (full opacity)
               will be used.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--query-id</b>=<u>OBJECT-ID[,OBJECT-ID]*</u>
               Set the ID(s) of the object(s) whose dimensions are queried in a  comma-separated  list.  If  not
               set, query options will return the dimensions of the drawing (i.e. all document objects), not the
               page or viewbox.

               If  you  specify  many  values  with  a comma separated list of objects, any geometry query (e.g.
               --query-x) will return a comma separated list of values corresponding to the list of  objects  in
               <u>--query-id</u>.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--query-all</b>
               Prints  a comma delimited listing of all objects in the SVG document with IDs defined, along with
               their x, y, width, and height values.

       <b>-X</b>, <b>--query-x</b>
               Query the X coordinate of the drawing or, if  specified,  of  the  object  with  --query-id.  The
               returned value is in px (SVG user units).

       <b>-Y</b>, <b>--query-y</b>
               Query  the  Y  coordinate  of  the  drawing  or, if specified, of the object with --query-id. The
               returned value is in px (SVG user units).

       <b>-W</b>, <b>--query-width</b>
               Query the width of the drawing or, if specified, of the  object  with  --query-id.  The  returned
               value is in px (SVG user units).

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--query-height</b>
               Query  the  height  of  the drawing or, if specified, of the object with --query-id. The returned
               value is in px (SVG user units).

       <b>--vacuum-defs</b>
               Remove all unused items from the "&lt;defs&gt;" section of the SVG file.  If this option is invoked  in
               conjunction  with  --export-plain-svg,  only  the  exported file will be affected.  If it is used
               alone, the specified file will be modified in place.

       <b>--select</b>=<u>OBJECT-ID[,OBJECT-ID]*</u>
               The --select command will cause objects that have the ID  specified  to  be  selected.   You  can
               select  many  objects  width a comma separated list.  This allows various verbs to act upon them.
               To remove all the selections use "--verb=EditDeselect".  The object IDs available  are  dependent
               on the document specified to load.

       <b>--actions</b>=<u>ACTION(:ARG)[;ACTION(:ARG)]*</u>
               Actions  are  a new method to call functions with an optional single parameter.  To get a list of
               the action IDs available, use the --action-list command line option.  Eventually all  verbs  will
               be  replaced  by actions.   Temporarily, any verb can be used as an action (without a parameter).
               Note, most verbs require a GUI (even if they don't use it). To close the GUI automatically at the
               end of processing, use --batch-process.  In addition all export  options  have  matching  actions
               (remove the '--' in front of the option and replace '=' with ':').

               If only actions are used --batch-process must be used.

               Export  can  be  forced  at  any  point with the export-do action. This allows one to do multiple
               exports on a single file.

       <b>--action-list</b>
               Prints a list of all available actions.

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--with-gui</b>
               Try to use the GUI (on Unix, use the X server even if $DISPLAY is not set).

       <b>--display</b>=<u>DISPLAY</u>
               Sets the X display to use for the Inkscape window.

       <b>--app-id-tag</b>=<u>TAG</u>
               Creates a unique instance of Inkscape with the application ID  'org.inkscape.Inkscape.TAG'.  This
               is  useful  to  separate the Inkscape instances when running different Inkscape versions or using
               different preferences files concurrently.

       <b>--batch-process</b>
               Close GUI after executing all actions or verbs.

       <b>--shell</b> With this parameter, Inkscape will enter an interactive command line shell mode.  In  this  mode,
               you  type  in  commands at the prompt and Inkscape executes them, without you having to run a new
               copy of Inkscape for each command. This feature is mostly useful for scripting and  server  uses:
               it  adds  no  new capabilities but allows you to improve the speed and memory requirements of any
               script that repeatedly  calls  Inkscape  to  perform  command  line  tasks  (such  as  export  or
               conversions).

               In shell mode Inkscape expects a sequence of actions (or verbs) as input.  They will be processed
               line  by  line,  that means typically when pressing enter.  It is possible (but not necessary) to
               put all actions on a single line.

               The following example opens a file and exports it into two different formats, then opens  another
               file and exports a single object:

                   file-open:file1.svg; export-type:pdf; export-do; export-type:png; export-do
                   file-open:file2.svg; export-id:rect2; export-id-only; export-filename:rect_only.svg; export-do

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The  main  configuration  file  is  located in <a href="file:~/.config/inkscape/preferences.xml">~/.config/inkscape/preferences.xml</a>; it stores a variety of
       customization settings that you can change in Inkscape (mostly in the Inkscape Preferences dialog).  Also
       in the subdirectories there, you can place your own:

       <b>$HOME</b>/.config/inkscape/extensions/ - extensions.

       <b>$HOME</b>/.config/inkscape/fonts/ - fonts.

       <b>$HOME</b>/.config/inkscape/icons/ - icon sets.

       <b>$HOME</b>/.config/inkscape/keys/ - keyboard maps.

       <b>$HOME</b>/.config/inkscape/paint/ - patterns and hatches.

       <b>$HOME</b>/.config/inkscape/palettes/ - palettes.

       <b>$HOME</b>/.config/inkscape/symbols/ - symbol files.

       <b>$HOME</b>/.config/inkscape/templates/ - new file templates.

       <b>$HOME</b>/.config/inkscape/ui/ - user interface files.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       The program returns zero on success or non-zero on failure.

       A variety of error messages and warnings may be printed to STDERR or  STDOUT.   If  the  program  behaves
       erratically with a particular SVG file or crashes, it is useful to look at this output for clues.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       While  obviously  <b>Inkscape</b>  is  primarily  intended  as  a  GUI application, it can be used for doing SVG
       processing on the command line as well.

       Open an SVG file in the GUI:

           inkscape filename.svg

       Export an SVG file into PNG with the default resolution of 96 dpi (one SVG user unit  translates  to  one
       bitmap pixel):

           inkscape --export-filename=filename.png filename.svg

       Same, but force the PNG file to be 600x400 pixels:

           inkscape --export-filename=filename.png -w 600 -h 400 filename.svg

       Same, but export the drawing (bounding box of all objects), not the page:

           inkscape --export-filename=filename.png --export-area-drawing filename.svg

       Export two different files into four distinct file formats each:

           inkscape --export-type=png,ps,eps,pdf filename1.svg filename2.svg

       Export  to PNG the object with id="text1555", using the output filename and the resolution that were used
       for that object last time when it was exported from the GUI:

           inkscape --export-id=text1555 --export-use-hints filename.svg

       Same, but use the default 96 dpi resolution, specify the filename, and snap the exported area outwards to
       the nearest whole SVG user unit  values  (to  preserve  pixel-alignment  of  objects  and  thus  minimize
       aliasing):

           inkscape --export-id=text1555 --export-filename=text.png --export-area-snap filename.svg

       Convert an Inkscape SVG document to plain SVG:

           inkscape --export-plain-svg --export-filename=filename2.svg filename1.svg

       Convert an SVG document to EPS, converting all texts to paths:

           inkscape --export-filename=filename.eps --export-text-to-path filename.svg

       Query the width of the object with id="text1555":

           inkscape --query-width --query-id=text1555 filename.svg

       Duplicate  the  objects  with id="path1555" and id="rect835", rotate the duplicates 90 degrees, save SVG,
       and quit:

           inkscape --select=path1555,rect835 --actions="duplicate;object-rotate-90-cw" --export-overwrite filename.svg

       Select all objects with ellipse tag, rotate them 30 degrees, save the file, and quit.

           inkscape --actions="select-by-element:ellipse;transform-rotate:30" --export-overwrite filename.svg

       Export the object with the  ID  MyTriangle  with  a  semi  transparent  purple  background  to  the  file
       triangle_purple.png and with a red background to the file triangle_red.png.

           inkscape --actions="export-id:MyTriangle; export-id-only; export-background:purple; export-background-opacity:0.5;export-filename:triangle_purple.png; export-do; export-background:red; export-background-opacity:1; export-filename:triangle_red.png; export-do" filename.svg

       Read an SVG from standard input (stdin) and export it to PDF format:

           cat filename.svg | inkscape --pipe --export-filename=filename.pdf

       Export  an SVG to PNG format and write it to standard output (stdout), then convert it to JPG format with
       ImageMagick's convert program:

           inkscape --export-type=png --export-filename=- filename.svg | convert - filename.jpg

       Same as above, but also reading from a pipe (--export-filename can be omitted in this case)

           cat filename.svg | inkscape --pipe --export-type=png | convert - filename.jpg

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>INKSCAPE_PROFILE_DIR</b>
               Set a custom location for the user profile directory.

       <b>INKSCAPE_DATADIR</b>
               Set a custom location for the Inkscape data directory (e.g. <b>$PREFIX</b>/share  if  Inkscape's  shared
               files are in <b>$PREFIX</b>/share/inkscape).

       <b>INKSCAPE_LOCALEDIR</b>
               Set a custom location for the translation catalog.

</pre><h4><b>THEMES</b></h4><pre>
       To  load  different  icons  sets  instead of the default <b>$PREFIX</b>/share/inkscape/icons/icons.svg file, the
       directory <b>$HOME</b>/.config/inkscape/icons/ is used.  Icons are loaded by name (e.g.  <u>fill_none.svg</u>),  or  if
       not  found, then from <u>icons.svg</u>.  If the icon is not loaded from either of those locations, it falls back
       to the default system location.

       The needed icons are loaded from SVG files by searching for the SVG id with the matching icon name.  (For
       example, to load the "fill_none" icon from a file, the bounding  box  seen  for  SVG  id  "fill_none"  is
       rendered as the icon, whether it comes from <u>fill_none.svg</u> or <u>icons.svg</u>.)

</pre><h4><b>GUI</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       To learn Inkscape's GUI operation, read the manual in Help &gt; Inkscape manual, and the tutorials in Help &gt;
       Tutorials.

       Apart  from SVG, Inkscape can import (File &gt; Import) most bitmap formats (PNG, BMP, JPG, XPM, GIF, etc.),
       plain text (requires Perl), PS and EPS (requires Ghostscript), PDF and  AI  format  (AI  version  9.0  or
       newer).

       Inkscape  exports  32-bit  PNG  images  (File  &gt;  Export PNG Image) as well as AI, PS, EPS, PDF, DXF, and
       several other formats via File &gt; Save as.

       Inkscape can use the pressure and tilt of a graphic tablet pen for width, angle, and force of  action  of
       several tools, including the Calligraphic pen.

       Inkscape includes a GUI front-end to the Potrace bitmap tracing engine (&lt;<a href="http://potrace.sf.net">http://potrace.sf.net</a>&gt;) which is
       embedded into Inkscape.

       Inkscape  can  use  external  scripts  (stdin-to-stdout  filters) that are represented by commands in the
       Extensions menu. A script can have a GUI dialog for setting various parameters and can get the IDs of the
       selected objects on which to act via the command line. Inkscape  comes  with  an  assortment  of  effects
       written in Python.

       version (file `NEWS').

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The  codebase  that  would  become Inkscape began life in 1999 as the program Gill, the GNOME Illustrator
       application, created by Raph Levien.  The stated objective for Gill was to eventually support all of SVG.
       Raph implemented the PostScript bezier imaging model, including stroking and  filling,  line  cap  style,
       line  join  style, text, etc.  Raph's Gill page is at &lt;<a href="http://www.levien.com/svg/">http://www.levien.com/svg/</a>&gt;.  Work on Gill appears
       to have slowed or ceased in 2000.

       The next incarnation of the codebase was to become the highly popular program  Sodipodi,  led  by  Lauris
       Kaplinski.   The  codebase  was  turned  into  a powerful illustration program over the course of several
       year's work, adding several new features, multi-lingual support, porting to Windows and  other  operating
       systems, and eliminating dependencies.

       Inkscape  was  formed  in  2003  by  four active Sodipodi developers, Bryce Harrington, MenTaLguY, Nathan
       Hurst, and Ted Gould, wanting to take a different direction with the codebase in terms of  focus  on  SVG
       compliance, interface look-and-feel, and a desire to open development opportunities to more participants.
       The project progressed rapidly, gaining a number of very active contributors and features.

       Much  work  in the early days of the project focused on code stabilization and internationalization.  The
       original renderer inherited from Sodipodi was laced with a number of mathematical corner cases which  led
       to  unexpected  crashes  when the program was pushed beyond routine uses; this renderer was replaced with
       Livarot which, while not perfect either, was significantly less error prone.  The project also adopted  a
       practice  of  committing  code  frequently,  and  encouraging users to run developmental snapshots of the
       program; this helped identify new bugs swiftly, and ensure it was easy for users to verify the fixes.  As
       a result, Inkscape releases have generally earned a reputation for being robust and reliable.

       Similarly, efforts were taken to internationalize and  localize  the  interface,  which  has  helped  the
       program gain contributors worldwide.

       Inkscape has had a beneficial impact on the visual attractiveness of Open Source in general, by providing
       a  tool  for creating and sharing icons, splash screens, website art, and so on.  In a way, despite being
       "just an drawing program", Inkscape has played an important role in  making  Open  Source  more  visually
       stimulating to larger audiences.
