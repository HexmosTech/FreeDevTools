</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       classified-ads - Program for posting ads online for others to see

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>classified-ads</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Classified  ads is a program for online communications.  Main features include server-less design, public
       announcements, private messages, user data and comments. For longer explanation of  the  program,  please
       see "About" dialog inside the program.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       For  each  individual  user  a  file  $HOME/.classified_ads/sqlite_db is created. This is a normal sqlite
       database that contains state of the program. For backup purpose a copy may be  made  and  later  restored
       while  the  program  is not running. Restoring an old file fully resets the programs state to moment when
       backup was taken.

       Upon uninstall of the program, the datafile is left lingering around.  Users who are sure  they'll  never
       use  the  program  again should delete the file by hand. Note that users' encryption keys are inside this
       file among other data so deleting the file will affect users' ability to access private messages later.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
