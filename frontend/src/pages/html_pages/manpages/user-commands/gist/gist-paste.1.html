</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gist-paste</b> - upload code to https://gist.github.com

</pre><h4><b>Synopsis</b></h4><pre>
       The  gist  gem  provides  a  <b>gist-paste</b>  command that you can use from your terminal to upload content to
       https://gist.github.com/.

</pre><h4><b>Installation</b></h4><pre>
       •   If you have ruby installed:

           gem install gist

       •   If you´re using Bundler:

           source :rubygems gem ´gist´

       •   For OS X, gist lives in Homebrew

           brew install gist

       •   For FreeBSD, gist lives in ports

           pkg install gist

</pre><h4><b>Command</b></h4><pre>
       •   To upload the contents of <b>a.rb</b> just:

           gist-paste a.rb

       •   Upload multiple files:

           gist-paste a b c gist *.rb

       •   By default it reads from STDIN, and you can set a filename with <b>-f</b>.

           gist-paste -f test.rb &lt;a.rb

       •   Alternatively, you can just paste from the clipboard:

           gist-paste -P

       •   Use <b>-p</b> to make the gist private:

           gist-paste -p a.rb

       •   Use <b>-d</b> to add a description:

           gist-paste -d "Random rbx bug" a.rb

       •   You can update existing gists with <b>-u</b>:

           gist-paste -u GIST_ID FILE_NAME gist -u 42f2c239d2eb57299408 test.txt

       •   If you´d like to copy the resulting URL to your clipboard, use <b>-c</b>.

           gist-paste -c &lt;a.rb

       •   If you´d like to copy the resulting embeddable URL to your clipboard, use <b>-e</b>.

           gist-paste -e &lt;a.rb

       •   And you can just ask <b>gist-paste</b> to open a browser window directly with <b>-o</b>.

           gist-paste -o &lt;a.rb

       •   To list (public gists or all gists for authed user) gists for user

           gist-paste -l : all gists for authed user

           gist-paste -l defunkt : list defunkt´s public gists

       To read a gist and print it to STDOUT

           gist-paste -r GIST_ID
           gist-paste -r 374130

       •   See <b>gist-paste</b> <b>--help</b> for more detail.

</pre><h4><b>Login</b></h4><pre>
       Before you use <b>gist-paste</b> for the first time you will need to log  in.  There  are  two  supported  login
       flows:

       1.  The  Github  device-code Oauth flow. This is the default for authenticating to github.com, and can be
           enabled for Github Enterprise by creating an  Oauth  app,  and  exporting  the  environment  variable
           <b>GIST_CLIENT_ID</b> with the client id of the Oauth app.

       2.  The  (deprecated)  username  and  password  token  exchange  flow.  This  is  the  default for GitHub
           Enterprise,  and  can  be  used  to  log  into  github.com  by  exporting  the  environment  variable
           <b>GIST_USE_USERNAME_AND_PASSWORD</b>.

   <b>The</b> <b>device-code</b> <b>flow</b>
       This  flow  allows  you to obtain a token by logging into GitHub in the browser and typing a verification
       code. This is the preferred mechanism.

           gist-paste --login
           Requesting login parameters...
           Please sign in at https://github.com/login/device
             and enter code: XXXX-XXXX
           Success! https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/4f7ec0d4eab38e74384e

       The returned access_token is stored in <b><a href="file:~/.gist">~/.gist</a></b> and used for all future gisting. If you need  to  you  can
       revoke access from https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/4f7ec0d4eab38e74384e.

   <b>The</b> <b>username-password</b> <b>flow</b>
       This  flow asks for your GitHub username and password (and 2FA code), and exchanges them for a token with
       the "gist" permission (your username and password are  not  stored).  This  mechanism  is  deprecated  by
       GitHub, but may still work with GitHub Enterprise.

           gist-paste --login
           Obtaining OAuth2 access_token from GitHub.
           GitHub username: ConradIrwin
           GitHub password:
           2-factor auth code:
           Success! https://github.com/settings/tokens

       This  token  is  stored in <b><a href="file:~/.gist">~/.gist</a></b> and used for all future gisting. If you need to you can revoke it from
       https://github.com/settings/tokens, or just delete the file.

       If you have a complicated authorization requirement you can manually create a token  file  by  pasting  a
       GitHub token with <b>gist</b> scope (and maybe the <b>user:email</b> for GitHub Enterprise) into a file called <b><a href="file:~/.gist">~/.gist</a></b>.
       You can create one from https://github.com/settings/tokens

       This  file  should  contain  only  the  token  (~40  hex  characters), and to make it easier to edit, can
       optionally have a final newline (<b>\n</b> or <b>\r\n</b>).

       For example, one way to create this file would be to run:

           (umask 0077 &amp;&amp; echo MY_SECRET_TOKEN &gt; <a href="file:~/.gist">~/.gist</a>)

       The <b>umask</b> ensures that the file is only accessible from your user account.

   <b>GitHub</b> <b>Enterprise</b>
       If you´d like <b>gist-paste</b> to use your locally installed GitHub Enterprise  <u>https://enterprise.github.com/</u>,
       you need to export the <b>GITHUB_URL</b> environment variable (usually done in your <b><a href="file:~/.bashrc">~/.bashrc</a></b>).

           export GITHUB_URL=<a href="http://github.internal.example.com/">http://github.internal.example.com/</a>

       Once  you´ve  done  this  and  restarted  your  terminal  (or  run  <b>source</b>  <b><a href="file:~/.bashrc">~/.bashrc</a></b>),  gist-paste  will
       automatically use GitHub Enterprise instead of the public github.com

       Your token  for  GitHub  Enterprise  will  be  stored  in  <b>.gist.&lt;protocol&gt;.&lt;server.name&gt;[.&lt;port&gt;]</b>  (e.g.
       <b><a href="file:~/.gist.http.github.internal.example.com">~/.gist.http.github.internal.example.com</a></b> for the GITHUB_URL example above) instead of <b><a href="file:~/.gist">~/.gist</a></b>.

       If  you  have  multiple  servers  or  use Enterprise and public GitHub often, you can work around this by
       creating scripts that set the env var and then run <b>gist-paste</b>. Keep in mind that to use the public GitHub
       you must unset the env var. Just setting it to the public URL will not work. Use <b>unset</b> <b>GITHUB_URL</b>

   <b>Token</b> <b>file</b> <b>format</b>
       If you cannot use passwords, as most Enterprise installations do, you can generate the token via the  web
       interface  and  then  simply  save  the string in the correct file. Avoid line breaks or you might see: <b>$</b>
       <b>gist-paste</b> <b>-l</b> <b>Error:</b> <b>Bad</b> <b>credentials</b>

       You can also use Gist as a library from inside your ruby code:

              Gist.gist("Look.at(:my =&gt; ´awesome´).code")

       If you need more advanced features you can also pass:

       •   <b>:access_token</b> to authenticate using OAuth2 (default is `File.read("<a href="file:~/.gist">~/.gist</a>")).

       •   <b>:filename</b> to change the syntax highlighting (default is <b>a.rb</b>).

       •   <b>:public</b> if you want your gist to have a guessable url.

       •   <b>:description</b> to add a description to your gist.

       •   <b>:update</b> to update an existing gist (can be a URL or an id).

       •   <b>:copy</b> to copy the resulting URL to the clipboard (default is false).

       •   <b>:open</b> to open the resulting URL in a browser (default is false).

       NOTE: The access_token must have the <b>gist</b> scope and may also require the <b>user:email</b> scope.

       •   If you want to upload multiple files in the same gist, you can:

           Gist.multi_gist("a.rb" =&gt; "Foo.bar", "a.py" =&gt; "Foo.bar")

       •   If you´d rather use gist-paste´s builtin access_token, then you can force the user to obtain  one  by
           calling:

           Gist.login!

       •   This  will  take  them  through  the process of obtaining an OAuth2 token, and storing it in <b><a href="file:~/.gist">~/.gist</a></b>,
           where it can later be read by <b>Gist.gist</b>

</pre><h4><b>Configuration</b></h4><pre>
       •   If you´d like <b>-o</b> or <b>-c</b> to be the default when you use the gist-paste executable, add an alias to your
           <b><a href="file:~/.bashrc">~/.bashrc</a></b> (or equivalent). For example:

           alias gist=´gist -c´

       •   If you´d prefer gist-paste to open a different browser, then you can export the  BROWSER  environment
           variable:

           export BROWSER=google-chrome

       If  clipboard  or  browser integration don´t work on your platform, please file a bug or (more ideally) a
       pull request.

       If you need to use an HTTP proxy to access the internet, export the <b>HTTP_PROXY</b> or <b>http_proxy</b>  environment
       variable and gist-paste will use it.
