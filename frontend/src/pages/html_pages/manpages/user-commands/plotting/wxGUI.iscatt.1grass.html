</pre><h4><b>wxGUI</b> <b>Interactive</b> <b>Scatter</b> <b>Plot</b> <b>Tool</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>KEYWORDS</b></h4><pre>
       display, GUI, imagery, scatterplot, plot

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Interactive</b>  <b>Scatter</b>  <b>Plot</b>  <b>Tool</b>  allows  analyzing  group  of  raster  maps. The tool is integrated into
       <u>Supervised</u> <u>Classification</u> <u>Tool</u> (see the screen shot below).  Also it is possible to launch  it  from  Map
       Display  Window  (Analyze  map  →  Interactive  Scatter  Plot  Tool).   The main idea of the tool is that
       everything is linked together (scatter plots together and mapwindow with the scatter  plots).   The  main
       feature of the tool is the interactivity, which allows user to:

           •   work with multiple plots, which represents multiple raster bands combinations,

           •   highlight  plotted  points in open scatter plots according to currently chosen pixels for classes
               by it’s training areas (supported only in <u>Supervised</u> <u>Classification</u> <u>Tool</u>),

           •   be able to define areas in plots and the tool will highlight pixels in  map  display  window  and
               corresponding points in other plots,

           •   plot of confidence ellipses.

</pre><h4><b>TOOL</b> <b>CONTROLS</b> <b>LAYOUT</b></h4><pre>
       If  editing  mode  is activated (the green polygon tool in toolbar), the areas which were selected in the
       scatter plots are highlighted. In the image you can see this area for scatter  plot  of  bands  B_6,  B_7
       inside  the ellipse.  Opacity and color of the selected area can be set in settings. The area corresponds
       to the active class (in this case clouds).  Selected areas are subset of  areas,  which  belongs  to  the
       category.

       In the editing mode it is possible to select certain area by the polygon, which can be created and edited
       by  tools  in  editing  toolbar.   After  the  area is selected, we can include or exclude it into active
       category by clicking on the first (plus) respectively second (minus) tool  in  the  editing  toolbar.  In
       mapwindow  corresponding  pixels  are  shown  by  the class raster representing selected areas in scatter
       plots. In this case we can see clouds class raster (blue), forest class raster (green)  and  water  class
       raster (red).

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The  tool  can  analyze  only  integer  (CELL) rasters.  It works with 8 bit range smoothly.  The tool is
       capable of processing data up to 12 bit range, however it is not recommended open many scatter  plots  in
       12/11  bit  mode.   It  could require significant amount of memory and plot rendering time can be longer.
       Analyzing of raster data with higher range is not recommended.  The raster range  can  be  lowered  using
       <u>r.rescale</u>.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       Selection  of  areas  in  mapwindow  is currently supported only if the tool was launched from <u>Supervised</u>
       <u>Classification</u> <u>Tool</u>.
