       plotchangelog - graph Debian changelogs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>plotchangelog</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>changelog</u> ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>plotchangelog</b>  is  a  tool  to  aid  in  visualizing  a Debian <u>changelog</u>. The changelogs are graphed with
       <b><a href="../man1/gnuplot.1.html">gnuplot</a></b>(1) , with the X axis of the graph denoting time of release and the Y  axis  denoting  the  Debian
       version  number of the package. Each individual release of the package is represented by a point, and the
       points are color coded to indicate who released that version of the package. The upstream version  number
       of the package can also be labeled on the graph.

       Alternatively,  the  Y  axis  can  be  configured to display the size of the changelog entry for each new
       version. Or it can be configured to display approximately how many bugs were fixed for each new version.

       Note that if the package is a Debian-specific package, the entire package version will be used for the  Y
       axis. This does not always work perfectly.

</pre><h4><b>READING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>GRAPH</b></h4><pre>
       The  general  outline  of a package's graph is typically a series of peaks, starting at 1, going up to n,
       and then returning abruptly to 1. The higher the peaks, the more releases the maintainer made between new
       upstream versions of the package. If a package is Debian-only, it's graph will just grow upwards  without
       ever  falling  (although a bug in this program may cause it to fall sometimes, if the version number goes
       from say, 0.9 to say, 0.10 - this is interpreted wrong...)

       If the graph dips below 1, someone made a NMU of the package and upgraded it to a new  upstream  version,
       thus  setting the Debian version to 0. NMU's in general appear as fractional points like 1.1, 2.1, etc. A
       NMU can also be easily detected by looking at the points that represent  which  maintainer  uploaded  the
       package -- a solitary point of a different type than the points before and after it is typically a NMU.

       It's also easy to tell by looking at the points when a package changes maintainers.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-l</b>, <b>--linecount</b>
              Instead of using the Debian version number as the Y axis, use the number of lines in the changelog
              entry for each version.  Cannot be used together with <b>--bugcount</b>.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--bugcount</b>
              Instead  of using the Debian version number as the Y axis, use the number of bugs that were closed
              by each changelog entry. Note that this number  is  obtained  by  searching  for  "#dddd"  in  the
              changelog, and so it may be inaccurate.  Cannot be used together with <b>--linecount</b>.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--cumulative</b>
              When  used together with either <b>--bugcount</b> or <b>--linecount</b>, graphs the cumulative count rather than
              the count in each individual changelog entry.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--no-version</b>
              Do not show upstream version labels. Useful if the graph gets too crowded.

       <b>-m,</b> <b>--no-maint</b>
              Do not differentiate between different maintainers of the package.

       <b>-s</b> <b>file</b>, <b>--save=</b><u>file</u>
              Save the graph to <u>file</u> in PostScript format instead of immediately displaying it.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--urgency</b>
              Use larger points when displaying higher-urgency package uploads.

       <b>--verbose</b>
              Output the gnuplot script that is fed into gnuplot (for debugging purposes).

       <b>-g</b><u>commands</u>, <b>--gnuplot=</b><u>commands</u>
              This allows you to insert <b><a href="../man1/gnuplot.1.html">gnuplot</a></b>(1) commands into the gnuplot script that is used to generate the
              graph. The commands are placed after all initialization but before the final  <b>plot</b>  command.  This
              can  be used to override the default look provided by this program in arbitrary ways. You can also
              use things like "set terminal png color" to change the  output  file  type,  which  is  useful  in
              conjunction with the -s option.

       <b>--help</b> Show a usage summary.

       <b>--version</b>
              Display version, author and copyright information.

       <b>--noconf</b>, <b>--no-conf</b>
              Do not read any configuration files (see below).

       <u>changelog</u> ...
              The  <u>changelog</u>  files  to graph. If multiple files are specified they will all be displayed on the
              same graph. The files may be compressed with gzip.  Any  text  in  them  that  is  not  in  Debian
              changelog format will be ignored.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  two  configuration files <u>/etc/devscripts.conf</u> and <u><a href="file:~/.devscripts">~/.devscripts</a></u> are sourced by a shell in that order
       to set configuration variables.  The <b>--no-conf</b> option  can  be  used  to  prevent  reading  these  files.
       Environment  variable  settings  are  ignored  when  these  configuration  files are read.  The currently
       recognised variables are:

       <b>PLOTCHANGELOG_OPTIONS</b>
              This is a space-separated list of options to always use, for example <b>-l</b> <b>-b</b>.  Do not include <b>-g</b>  or
              <b>--gnuplot</b> among this list as it may be ignored; see the next variable instead.

       <b>PLOTCHANGELOG_GNUPLOT</b>
              These are <b>gnuplot</b> commands which will be prepended to any such commands given on the command line.
