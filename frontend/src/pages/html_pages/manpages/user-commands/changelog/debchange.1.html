</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       debchange - Tool for maintenance of the debian/changelog file in a source package

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>debchange</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>text</u> ...]
       <b>dch</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>text</u> ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>debchange</b>  or  its  alias  <b>dch</b>  will add a new comment line to the Debian changelog in the current source
       tree.  This command must be run from within that tree.  If the text of the change is given on the command
       line, <b>debchange</b> will run in batch mode and simply add the text, with line breaks  as  necessary,  at  the
       appropriate  place  in  <u>debian/changelog</u> (or the changelog specified by options, as described below).  If
       the text given on the command line is a null string, <b>debchange</b> will run in batch mode without adding  any
       text.   If the text given on the command line is a space string, <b>debchange</b> will run in batch mode and add
       a blank changelog entry.  If no text is specified then <b>debchange</b> will run the  editor  as  determined  by
       <b>sensible-editor</b>  for you to edit the file.  (The environment variables <b>VISUAL</b> and <b>EDITOR</b> are used in this
       order to determine which editor to use.)  Editors which understand the <u>+n</u> option for starting the editing
       on a specified line will use this to move to the correct line of the file for editing.  If the editor  is
       quit  without  modifying the temporary file, <b>debchange</b> will exit without touching the existing changelog.
       <b>Note</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>changelog</b> <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>encoded</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>UTF-8</b> <b>encoding.</b>  <b>If</b> <b>it</b>  <b>is</b>  <b>not,</b>  <b>problems</b>  <b>may</b>
       <b>occur.</b>   Please  see  the  <b><a href="../man1/iconv.1.html">iconv</a></b>(1)  manpage to find out how to convert changelogs from legacy encodings.
       Finally, a <u>changelog</u> or <u>NEWS</u> file can be created from scratch using the <b>--create</b> option described below.

       <b>debchange</b> also supports automatically producing bug-closing changelog entries, using the <b>--closes</b> option.
       This will usually query the BTS,  the  Debian  Bug  Tracking  System  (see  https://bugs.debian.org/)  to
       determine  the  title  of  the  bug and the package in which it occurs.  This behaviour can be stopped by
       giving a <b>--noquery</b> option or  by  setting  the  configuration  variable  <b>DEBCHANGE_QUERY_BTS</b>  to  <u>no</u>,  as
       described  below.   In  either  case,  the  editor (as described above) will always be invoked to give an
       opportunity to modify the entries, and the changelog will be accepted whether or  not  modifications  are
       made.  An extra changelog entry can be given on the command line in addition to the closes entries.

       At  most  one  of  <b>--append</b>,  <b>--increment</b>, <b>--edit</b>, <b>--release</b>, and <b>--newversion</b> may be specified as listed
       below. If no options are specified, <b>debchange</b> will use heuristics to guess whether or not the package has
       been successfully released, and behave as if <b>--increment</b> had been  specified  if  the  package  has  been
       released, or otherwise as if <b>--append</b> has been specified.

       Two  different  sets  of  heuristics  can be used, as controlled by the <b>--release-heuristic</b> option or the
       <b>DEBCHANGE_RELEASE_HEURISTIC</b> configuration variable. The default <u>changelog</u> heuristic assumes  the  package
       has  been  released unless its changelog contains <b>UNRELEASED</b> in the distribution field. If this heuristic
       is enabled then  the  distribution  will  default  to  <b>UNRELEASED</b>  in  new  changelog  entries,  and  the
       <b>--mainttrailer</b>  option described below will be automatically enabled. This can be useful if a package can
       be released by different maintainers, or if you do not keep the upload logs. The alternate <u>log</u>  heuristic
       determines if a package has been released by looking for an appropriate <b><a href="../man1/dupload.1.html">dupload</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man1/dput.1.html">dput</a></b>(1) log file in
       the  parent  directory.  A warning will be issued if the log file is found but a successful upload is not
       recorded. This may be because the previous upload was performed with a version of <b>dupload</b> prior to 2.1 or
       because the upload failed.

       If either <b>--increment</b> or <b>--newversion</b> is used, the name and email for the new version will be  determined
       as  follows.   If  the environment variable <b>DEBFULLNAME</b> is set, this will be used for the maintainer full
       name; if not, then <b>NAME</b> will be checked.  If the environment variable <b>DEBEMAIL</b> is set, this will be  used
       for  the email address.  If this variable has the form "name &lt;email&gt;", then the maintainer name will also
       be taken from here if neither <b>DEBFULLNAME</b> nor <b>NAME</b> is set.  If this variable is not set, the same test is
       performed on the environment variable <b>EMAIL</b>.  Next, if the full name has still not been determined,  then
       use  <b><a href="../man3/getpwuid.3.html">getpwuid</a></b>(3) to determine the name from the password file.  If this fails, use the previous changelog
       entry.  For the email address, if it has not been set from <b>DEBEMAIL</b> or <b>EMAIL</b>, then look in <u>/etc/mailname</u>,
       then attempt to build it from the username and FQDN, otherwise use the  email  address  in  the  previous
       changelog  entry.   In  other  words,  it's  a  good idea to set <b>DEBEMAIL</b> and <b>DEBFULLNAME</b> when using this
       script.

       Support is included for changelogs that record changes by multiple co-maintainers of  a  package.  If  an
       entry  is  appended to the current version's entries, and the maintainer is different from the maintainer
       who is listed as having done the previous entries, then lines will be added  to  the  changelog  to  tell
       which  maintainers  made  which  changes. Currently only one of the several such styles of recording this
       information is supported, in which the name of the maintainer who made a set of changes appears on a line
       before the changes, inside square brackets. This can be switched on and off  using  the  <b>--</b>[<b>no</b>]<b>multimaint</b>
       option  or the <b>DEBCHANGE_MULTIMAINT</b> configuration file option; the default is to enable it.  Note that if
       an entry has already been marked in this way, then this option will be silently ignored.

       If the directory name of the source tree has the form <u>package</u>-<u>version</u>, then <b>debchange</b> will  also  attempt
       to  rename  it  if  the (upstream) version number changes.  This can be prevented by using the <b>--preserve</b>
       command line or configuration file option as described below.

       If <b>--force-bad-version</b> or <b>--allow-lower-version</b> is used, <b>debchange</b> will not stop if the  new  version  is
       less than the current one.  This is especially useful while doing backports.

</pre><h4><b>Directory</b> <b>name</b> <b>checking</b></h4><pre>
       In  common  with several other scripts in the <b>devscripts</b> package, <b>debchange</b> will climb the directory tree
       until it finds a <u>debian/changelog</u> file.  As a safeguard against stray files causing  potential  problems,
       it  will examine the name of the parent directory once it finds the <u>debian/changelog</u> file, and check that
       the directory name corresponds to the package name.  Precisely how it does  this  is  controlled  by  two
       configuration file variables <b>DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL</b> and <b>DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX</b>, and their
       corresponding command-line options <b>--check-dirname-level</b> and <b>--check-dirname-regex</b>.

       <b>DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL</b> can take the following values:

       <b>0</b>      Never check the directory name.

       <b>1</b>      Only   check  the  directory  name  if  we  have  had  to  change  directory  in  our  search  for
              <u>debian/changelog</u>.  This is the default behaviour.

       <b>2</b>      Always check the directory name.

       The directory name is checked by testing whether the current directory name  (as  determined  by  <b><a href="../man1/pwd.1.html">pwd</a></b>(1))
       matches the regex given by the configuration file option <b>DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX</b> or by the command
       line  option  <b>--check-dirname-regex</b> <u>regex</u>.  Here <u>regex</u> is a Perl regex (see <b><a href="../man3perl/perlre.3perl.html">perlre</a></b>(3perl)), which will be
       anchored at the beginning and the end.  If <u>regex</u> contains a '<b>/</b>', then it must match  the  full  directory
       path.   If not, then it must match the full directory name.  If <u>regex</u> contains the string Â´<b>PACKAGE</b>', this
       will be replaced by the source package name, as determined from the changelog.  The default value for the
       regex is: Â´<b>PACKAGE(-.+)?</b>', thus matching directory names such as <b>PACKAGE</b> and <b>PACKAGE-</b><u>version</u>.

       The default changelog to  be  edited  is  <u>debian/changelog</u>;  however,  this  can  be  changed  using  the
       <b>--changelog</b> or <b>--news</b> options or the <b>CHANGELOG</b> environment variable, as described below.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--append</b>, <b>-a</b>
              Add a new changelog entry at the end of the current version's entries.

       <b>--increment</b>, <b>-i</b>
              Increment  either  the final component of the Debian release number or, if this is a native Debian
              package, the version number.  On Ubuntu or Tanglu, this will also change the suffix from buildX to
              ubuntu1/tanglu1.  Use <b>-R</b>, <b>--rebuild</b> for a no change rebuild increment.  This creates a new section
              at the beginning of the changelog with appropriate headers and footers.  Also, if this  is  a  new
              version  of  a  native  Debian  package,  the  directory  name  is  changed  to  reflect this.  If
              <b>DEBCHANGE_RELEASE_HEURISTIC</b> is <u>changelog</u> (default) and the current  release  is  <u>UNRELEASED</u>,  this
              will  only  change the version of the current changelog stanza.  Otherwise, this will create a new
              changelog stanza with the new version.

       <b>--newversion</b> <u>version</u>, <b>-v</b> <u>version</u>
              This specifies the version number (including the Debian release part) explicitly  and  behaves  as
              the  <b>--increment</b> option in other respects.  It will also change the directory name if the upstream
              version number has changed.  If <b>DEBCHANGE_RELEASE_HEURISTIC</b> is <u>changelog</u> (default) and the current
              release is <u>UNRELEASED</u>, this will  only  change  the  version  of  the  current  changelog  stanza.
              Otherwise, this will create a new changelog stanza with the new version.

       <b>--edit</b>, <b>-e</b>
              Edit the changelog in an editor.

       <b>--release</b>, <b>-r</b>
              Finalize  the changelog for a release.  Update the changelog timestamp. If the distribution is set
              to <b>UNRELEASED</b>, change it to the  distribution  from  the  previous  changelog  entry  (or  another
              distribution  as  specified by <b>--distribution</b>).  If there are no previous changelog entries and an
              explicit distribution has not been specified, <b>unstable</b> will be used (or the name  of  the  current
              development release when run under Ubuntu).

       <b>--force-save-on-release</b>
              When  <b>--release</b>  is  used,  an editor is opened to allow inspection of the changelog.  The user is
              required to save the file to accept the modified changelog, otherwise the original  will  be  kept
              (default).

       <b>--no-force-save-on-release</b>
              Do  not  do  so.  Note  that  a dummy changelog entry may be supplied in order to achieve the same
              effect - e.g. <b>debchange</b> <b>--release</b> <b>""</b>.  The entry will not  be  added  to  the  changelog  but  its
              presence will suppress the editor.

       <b>--create</b>
              This  will create a new <u>debian/changelog</u> file (or <u>NEWS</u> if the <b>--news</b> option is used).  You must be
              in the top-level directory to use this; no directory name checking will be performed.  The package
              name and version can either be specified using the <b>--package</b> and <b>--newversion</b> options,  determined
              from  the  directory  name  using  the <b>--fromdirname</b> option or entered manually into the generated
              <u>changelog</u> file.  The maintainer name is determined from the environment if this is  possible,  and
              the distribution is specified either using the <b>--distribution</b> option or in the generated <u>changelog</u>
              file.

       <b>--empty</b>
              When  used  in  combination with <b>--create</b>, suppress the automatic addition of an "<b>initial</b> <b>release</b>"
              changelog entry (so that the next invocation of <b>debchange</b> adds the first entry).  Note  that  this
              will cause a <b>dpkg-parsechangelog</b> warning on the next invocation due to the lack of changes.

       <b>--package</b> <u>package</u>
              This  specifies  the  package  name  to  be  used  in  the new changelog; this may only be used in
              conjunction with the <b>--create</b>, <b>--increment</b> and <b>--newversion</b> options.

       <b>--nmu</b>, <b>-n</b>
              Increment the Debian release number for a non-maintainer upload by either appending a  "<b>.1</b>"  to  a
              non-NMU version number (unless the package is Debian native, in which case "<b>+nmu1</b>" is appended) or
              by  incrementing  an  NMU  version  number,  and  add  an  NMU  changelog  comment.   This happens
              automatically  if  the  packager  is  neither  in  the  <b>Maintainer</b>  nor  the  <b>Uploaders</b>  field  in
              <u>debian/control</u>, unless <b>DEBCHANGE_AUTO_NMU</b> is set to <u>no</u> or the <b>--no-auto-nmu</b> option is used.

       <b>--bin-nmu</b>
              Increment the Debian release number for a binary non-maintainer upload by either appending a "<b>+b1</b>"
              to  a  non-binNMU  version  number  or  by  incrementing a binNMU version number, and add a binNMU
              changelog comment.

       <b>--qa</b>, <b>-q</b>
              Increment the Debian release number for a Debian QA Team upload, and add  a  <b>QA</b>  <b>upload</b>  changelog
              comment.

       <b>--rebuild</b>, <b>-R</b>
              Increment  the  Debian  release  number  for  a  no-change  rebuild  by appending a "build1" or by
              incrementing a rebuild version number.

       <b>--security</b>, <b>-s</b>
              Increment the Debian release number for a Debian Security Team non-maintainer upload,  and  add  a
              <b>Security</b> <b>Team</b> <b>upload</b> changelog comment.

       <b>--lts</b>  Increment  the  Debian release number for a LTS Security Team non-maintainer upload, and add a <b>LTS</b>
              <b>Security</b> <b>Team</b> <b>upload</b> changelog comment.

       <b>--team</b> Increment the Debian release number for a team upload, and add a <b>Team</b> <b>upload</b> changelog comment.

       <b>--upstream</b>, <b>-U</b>
              Don't append <b>distro-name1</b> to the version on a derived distribution. Increment the Debian version.

       <b>--bpo</b>  Increment the Debian release number for an upload to bullseye-backports, and add a backport upload
              changelog comment.

       <b>--stable</b>
              Increment the Debian release number for an upload to the current stable release.

       <b>--local</b>, <b>-l</b><u>suffix</u>
               Add a suffix to the Debian version number for a local build.

       <b>--force-bad-version</b>, <b>-b</b>
              Force a version number to be less than the current one (e.g., when backporting).

       <b>--allow-lower-version</b> <u>pattern</u>
              Allow a version number to be less than the current one if the new version  matches  the  specified
              pattern.

       <b>--force-distribution</b>
              Force  the  provided  distribution  to  be  used,  even  if  it  doesn't  match  the list of known
              distributions (e.g. for unofficial distributions).

       <b>--auto-nmu</b>
              Attempt to automatically determine whether a change to the changelog represents a  Non  Maintainer
              Upload.  This is the default.

       <b>--no-auto-nmu</b>
              Disable automatic NMU detection.  Equivalent to setting <b>DEBCHANGE_AUTO_NMU</b> to <u>no</u>.

       <b>--fromdirname</b>, <b>-d</b>
              This  will  take  the upstream version number from the directory name, which should be of the form
              <u>package</u><b>-</b><u>version</u>.  If the upstream version number has increased  from  the  most  recent  changelog
              entry,  then  a new entry will be made with version number <u>version</u><b>-1</b> (or <u>version</u> if the package is
              Debian native), with the same epoch as the previous package  version.   If  the  upstream  version
              number is the same, this option will behave in the same way as <b>-i</b>.

       <b>--closes</b> <u>nnnnn</u>[<b>,</b><u>nnnnn</u> ...]
              Add  changelog  entries  to  close the specified bug numbers.  Also invoke the editor after adding
              these entries.  Will generate warnings if the BTS cannot be contacted (and <b>--noquery</b> has not  been
              specified), or if there are problems with the bug report located.

       <b>--</b>[<b>no</b>]<b>query</b>
              Should we attempt to query the BTS when generating closes entries?

       <b>--preserve</b>, <b>-p</b>
              Preserve the source tree directory name if the upstream version number (or the version number of a
              Debian native package) changes.  See also the configuration variables section below.

       <b>--no-preserve</b>, <b>--nopreserve</b>
              Do not preserve the source tree directory name (default).

       <b>--vendor</b> <u>vendor</u>
              Override  the  distributor  ID  over  the  default returned by dpkg-vendor.  This name is used for
              heuristics applied to new package versions and for sanity checking of the target distribution.

       <b>--distribution</b> <u>dist</u>, <b>-D</b> <u>dist</u>
              Use the specified distribution in the changelog entry being edited, instead of using the  previous
              changelog entry's distribution for new entries or the existing value for existing entries.

       <b>--urgency</b> <u>urgency</u>, <b>-u</b> <u>urgency</u>
              Use  the  specified  urgency  in  the  changelog  entry being edited, instead of using the default
              "<b>medium</b>" for new entries or the existing value for existing entries.

       <b>--changelog</b> <u>file</u>, <b>-c</b> <u>file</u>
              This will edit the changelog <u>file</u> instead of the standard <u>debian/changelog</u>.  This option overrides
              any <b>CHANGELOG</b> environment variable setting.  Also, no directory traversing  or  checking  will  be
              performed when this option is used.

       <b>--news</b> [<u>newsfile</u>]
              This  will  edit  <u>newsfile</u>  (by default, <u>debian/NEWS</u>) instead of the regular changelog.  Directory
              searching will be performed.  The changelog will be examined in order  to  determine  the  current
              package version.

       <b>--</b>[<b>no</b>]<b>multimaint</b>
              Should  we  indicate  that  parts  of  a  changelog entry have been made by different maintainers?
              Default is yes; see the discussion above and  also  the  <b>DEBCHANGE_MULTIMAINT</b>  configuration  file
              option below.

       <b>--</b>[<b>no</b>]<b>multimaint-merge</b>
              Should  all changes made by the same author be merged into the same changelog section?  Default is
              yes; see the discussion above and also the <b>DEBCHANGE_MULTIMAINT_MERGE</b>  configuration  file  option
              below.

       <b>--maintmaint</b>, <b>-m</b>
              Do  not  modify  the  maintainer  details  previously  listed  in  the  changelog.  This is useful
              particularly for sponsors wanting to automatically add a sponsorship  message  without  disrupting
              the  other  changelog  details.   Note  that  there may be some interesting interactions if multi-
              maintainer mode is in use; you will probably wish to check the changelog manually before uploading
              it in such cases.

       <b>--controlmaint</b>, <b>-M</b>
              Use maintainer details from the <u>debian/control</u> <b>Maintainer</b> field rather than  relevant  environment
              variables  (<b>DEBFULLNAME</b>,  <b>DEBEMAIL</b>,  etc.).  This option might be useful to restore details of the
              main maintainer in the changelog trailer after a bogus edit (e.g. when <b>-m</b> was intended but forgot)
              or when releasing a package in the name of the main maintainer (e.g. the team).

       <b>--</b>[<b>no</b>]<b>mainttrailer</b>, <b>-t</b>
              If <b>mainttrailer</b> is set, it will avoid modifying the existing  changelog  trailer  line  (i.e.  the
              maintainer  and  date-stamp  details),  unless  used  with  options that require the trailer to be
              modified (e.g. <b>--create</b>, <b>--release</b>, <b>-i</b>, <b>--qa</b>, etc.)  This option differs from <b>--maintmaint</b> in that
              it will use multi-maintainer mode if appropriate, with the exception of editing the  trailer.  See
              also the <b>DEBCHANGE_MAINTTRAILER</b> configuration file option below.

       <b>--check-dirname-level</b> <u>N</u>
              See the above section "<b>Directory</b> <b>name</b> <b>checking</b>" for an explanation of this option.

       <b>--check-dirname-regex</b> <u>regex</u>
              See the above section "<b>Directory</b> <b>name</b> <b>checking</b>" for an explanation of this option.

       <b>--no-conf</b>, <b>--noconf</b>

              a new changelog entry or append to an existing changelog entry.

       <b>--help</b>, <b>-h</b>
              Display a help message and exit successfully.

       <b>--version</b>
              Display version and copyright information and exit successfully.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  two  configuration  files  <u>/etc/devscripts.conf</u>  and  <u><a href="file:~/.devscripts">~/.devscripts</a></u> are sourced in that order to set
       configuration variables.  Command line options can be  used  to  override  configuration  file  settings.
       Environment variable settings are ignored for this purpose.  The currently recognised variables are:

       <b>DEBCHANGE_PRESERVE</b>
              If this is set to <u>yes</u>, then it is the same as the <b>--preserve</b> command line parameter being used.

       <b>DEBCHANGE_QUERY_BTS</b>
              If this is set to <u>no</u>, then it is the same as the <b>--noquery</b> command line parameter being used.

       <b>DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL</b>, <b>DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX</b>
              See  the above section "<b>Directory</b> <b>name</b> <b>checking</b>" for an explanation of these variables.  Note that
              these are package-wide configuration variables, and will therefore affect all  <b>devscripts</b>  scripts
              which check their value, as described in their respective manpages and in <b><a href="../man5/devscripts.conf.5.html">devscripts.conf</a></b>(5).

       <b>DEBCHANGE_RELEASE_HEURISTIC</b>
              Controls  how <b>debchange</b> determines if a package has been released, when deciding whether to create
              a new changelog entry or append to an existing changelog entry. Can be either <u>log</u> or <u>changelog</u>.

       <b>DEBCHANGE_MULTIMAINT</b>
              If set to <u>no</u>, <b>debchange</b> will not  introduce  multiple-maintainer  distinctions  when  a  different
              maintainer appends an entry to an existing changelog.  See the discussion above.  Default is <u>yes</u>.

       <b>DEBCHANGE_MULTIMAINT_MERGE</b>
              If  set  to  <u>yes</u>,  when  adding  changes  in multiple-maintainer mode <b>debchange</b> will check whether
              previous changes by the current maintainer exist and add the new changes  to  the  existing  block
              rather than creating a new block.  Default is <u>no</u>.

       <b>DEBCHANGE_MAINTTRAILER</b>
              If  this  is  set  to <u>no</u>, then it is the same as the <b>--nomainttrailer</b> command line parameter being
              used.

       <b>DEBCHANGE_TZ</b>
              Use this timezone for changelog entries.  Default is the user/system timezone as  shown  by  `<b>date</b>
              <b>-R</b>` and affected by the environment variable <b>TZ</b>.

       <b>DEBCHANGE_LOWER_VERSION_PATTERN</b>
              If  this  is  set,  then  it is the same as the <b>--allow-lower-version</b> command line parameter being
              used.

       <b>DEBCHANGE_AUTO_NMU</b>
              If this is set to <u>no</u> then <b>debchange</b> will  not  attempt  to  automatically  determine  whether  the
              current  changelog stanza represents an NMU.  The default is <u>yes</u>.  See the discussion of the <b>--nmu</b>
              option above.

       <b>DEBCHANGE_FORCE_SAVE_ON_RELEASE</b>
              If this is set to <u>no</u>, then it is the same as the <b>--no-force-save-on-release</b> command line parameter
              being used.

       <b>DEBCHANGE_VENDOR</b>
              Use this vendor instead of the default (dpkg-vendor output).  See <b>--vendor</b> for details.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DEBEMAIL</b>, <b>EMAIL</b>, <b>DEBFULLNAME</b>, <b>NAME</b>
              See the above description of the use of these environment variables.

       <b>CHANGELOG</b>
              This variable specifies the  changelog  to  edit  in  place  of  <u>debian/changelog</u>.   No  directory
              traversal  or checking is performed when this variable is set.  This variable is overridden by the
              <b>--changelog</b> command-line setting.

       <b>VISUAL</b>, <b>EDITOR</b>
              These environment variables (in this order) determine the editor used by <b>sensible-editor</b>.
