</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       git-merge-changelog - git merge driver for GNU ChangeLog files

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The default merge driver of 'git' <b>always</b> produces conflicts when pulling public modifications into a
       privately modified ChangeLog file.  This is because ChangeLog files are always modified at the top; the
       default merge driver has no clue how to deal with this. Furthermore the conflicts are presented with more
       &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; ==== &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; markers than necessary; this is because the default merge driver makes pointless efforts
       to look at the individual line changes inside a ChangeLog entry.

       This program serves as a 'git' merge driver that avoids these problems.

       1.  It  produces  no conflict when ChangeLog entries have been inserted at the top both in the public and
           in the private modification. It puts the privately added entries above the publicly added entries.

       2.  It respects the structure of ChangeLog files: entries are not split into lines but kept together.

       3.  It also handles the case of small modifications of past ChangeLog entries, or  of  removed  ChangeLog
           entries: they are merged as one would expect it.

       4.  Conflicts  are  presented  at  the top of the file, rather than where they occurred, so that the user
           will see them immediately. (Unlike for source code written in  some  programming  language,  conflict
           markers  that  are  located  several  hundreds lines from the top will not cause any syntax error and
           therefore would be likely to remain unnoticed.)

   <b>For</b> <b>git</b> <b>users:</b>
       -   Add to .git/config of the checkout (or to your $HOME/.gitconfig) the lines

            [merge "merge-changelog"]
                name = GNU-style ChangeLog merge driver
                driver = /usr/bin/git-merge-changelog %O %A %B

       -   Add to the top-level directory of the checkout a file '.gitattributes' with this line:

            ChangeLog    merge=merge-changelog

           (See "man 5 gitattributes" for more info.)

   <b>For</b> <b>bzr</b> <b>users:</b>
       -   Install the 'extmerge' bzr plug-in listed at  &lt;<a href="http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/plugins/en/index.html">http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/plugins/en/index.html</a>&gt;
           &lt;<a href="http://wiki.bazaar.canonical.com/BzrPlugins">http://wiki.bazaar.canonical.com/BzrPlugins</a>&gt;

       -   Add to your $HOME/.bazaar/bazaar.conf the line

            external_merge = git-merge-changelog %b %T %o

       -   Then, to merge a conflict in a ChangeLog file, use

            $ bzr extmerge ChangeLog

   <b>For</b> <b>hg</b> <b>users:</b>
       -   Add to your $HOME/.hgrc the lines

            [merge-patterns]
               ChangeLog = git-merge-changelog

            [merge-tools]
                git-merge-changelog.executable = /usr/bin/git-merge-changelog
                git-merge-changelog.args = $base $local $other

           See &lt;<a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/hgrc.5.html">http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/hgrc.5.html</a>&gt; section <b>merge-tools</b> for reference.

   <b>Use</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> <b>'diff3':</b>
       git-merge-changelog performs the same role as "diff3 -m", just with reordered arguments:

        $ git-merge-changelog %O %A %B

       is comparable to

        $ diff3 -m %A %O %B

   <b>Calling</b> <b>convention:</b>
       A merge driver is called with three filename arguments:

       1.  %O = The common ancestor of %A and %B.

       2.  %A = The file's contents from the "current branch".

       3.  %B = The file's contents from the "other branch"; this is the contents being merged in.

       In  case  of  a  "git  stash apply" or of an upstream pull (e.g. from a subsystem maintainer to a central
       maintainer) or of a downstream pull with --rebase:

       2.  %A = The file's newest pulled contents; modified by other committers.

       3.  %B = The user's newest copy of the file; modified by the user.

       In case of a downstream pull (e.g. from a central repository to the user) or of  an  upstream  pull  with
       --rebase:

       2.  %A = The user's newest copy of the file; modified by the user.

       3.  %B = The file's newest pulled contents; modified by other committers.

       It  should write its merged output into file %A. It can also echo some remarks to stdout.  It should exit
       with return code 0 if the merge could be resolved cleanly, or with non-zero return  code  if  there  were
       conflicts.

   <b>How</b> <b>it</b> <b>works:</b>
       The  structure  of a ChangeLog file: It consists of ChangeLog entries. A ChangeLog entry starts at a line
       following a blank line and that starts with a non-whitespace character, or at the beginning  of  a  file.
       The  merge driver works as follows: It reads the three files into memory and dissects them into ChangeLog
       entries. It then finds the differences between %O and %B. They are classified as:

       -   removals (some consecutive entries removed),

       -   changes (some consecutive entries removed, some consecutive entries added),

       -   additions (some consecutive entries added).

       The driver then attempts to apply the changes to %A.  To this effect, it first computes a  correspondence
       between  the  entries  in %O and the entries in %A, using fuzzy string matching to still identify changed
       entries.

       -   Removals are applied one by one. If the entry is present in %A, at any position, it  is  removed.  If
           not, the removal is marked as a conflict.

       -   Additions at the top of %B are applied at the top of %A.

       -   Additions  between  entry x and entry y (y may be the file end) in %B are applied between entry x and
           entry y in %A (if they still exist and are still consecutive in  %A),  otherwise  the  additions  are
           marked as a conflict.

       -   Changes are categorized into "simple changes":
            entry1 ... entryn are mapped to
            added_entry  ...  added_entry  modified_entry1 ... modified_entryn, where the correspondence between
           entry_i and modified_entry_i is still clear; and "big  changes":  these  are  all  the  rest.  Simple
           changes  at  the  top of %B are applied by putting the added entries at the top of %A. The changes in
           simple changes are applied one by one; possibly leading to single-entry conflicts.  Big  changes  are
           applied en bloc, possibly leading to conflicts spanning multiple entries.

       -   Conflicts are output at the top of the file and cause an exit status of 1.
