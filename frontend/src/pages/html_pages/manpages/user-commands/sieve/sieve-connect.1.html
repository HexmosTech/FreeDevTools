</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sieve-connect</b> is a client for the "MANAGESIEVE" protocol, which is an RFC-specified protocol for
       manipulation of "Sieve" scripts in a repository.  More simply, <b>sieve-connect</b> lets you control your mail-
       filtering rule files on a mail server.

       <b>sieve-connect</b> can be invoked with an action from the command-line to make it easy to script one-shot
       actions, it can be provided with a script file or it can be left to enter an interactive command-loop,
       where it supports tab-completion (if the supporting Perl module is available) and basic navigation of the
       local file-system in the style of "FTP" clients.

       <b>sieve-connect</b> supports the use of "TLS" via the "STARTTLS" command, including authentication via client
       certificates.  "sieve-connect" also supports whichever "SASL" mechanisms your <u>Authen::SASL::Perl</u> library
       provides, as long as they do not require SASL protection layers.

       In Interactive mode, a "help" command is available.  Command parameters with a "%" in them are examined
       to see if they match %KEYWORD, where "KEYWORD" is always in upper-case.  The list of keywords may be
       retrieved with the "keywords" command and includes items such as %DATE, %USER, etc.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Option names may be given as the shortest unique prefix.

       The remote sieve script name defaults to the same as the local sieve script name, so just specify the
       local one if only one is needed; it was a deliberate decision to have the defaults this way around, to
       make people think about names in the local filesystem.  There is no default script name.

       The <b>--debug</b> option turns on diagnostic traces.  The <b>--debugsasl</b> option asks the SASL library for
       debugging.  The <b>--dumptlsinfo</b> shows the TLS (SSL) peer information; if specified together with <b>--debug</b>
       then the server's PEM certificate will be provided as debug trace.

       The <b>--version</b> option shows version information.  When combined with <b>--debug</b> it will show implementation
       dependency versions.  The <b>--help</b> and <b>--man</b> options provide usage information.

       The server can be a host or IP address, IPv4 or IPv6.

       If a server is provided by <b>--server</b> then that takes precedence.  If that option is not present, then
       $IMAP_SERVER from the environment is checked and, if it's not a unix-domain socket path, is used with any
       port specification stripped off.

       For TLS verification, this is the default name used for hostnames (both SNI and verification); no
       information derived from DNS is currently used as the trusted hostname identifier.  (This is subject to
       change in future, given DNSSEC).  The <b>--tlshostname</b> option can be used to override the name used for TLS.

       Next, unless <b>--nosrv</b> is given, checks are made for SRV records so as to search for a default server; if
       the <u>Mozilla::PublicSuffix</u> Perl module is available, these checks are done for every level of the hostname
       upto (but not including) the public suffix.  If that module is not available, a crude heuristic is used:
       as long as there are three dots in the hostname, SRV records for the part of the hostname after the first
       dot are tried.  If this is inappropriate, install <u>Mozilla::PublicSuffix</u>.

       If no SRV records are found which point to a 'sieve', 'imaps' or 'imap' protocol service, of if a record
       is found which says "no such service in this domain" (by having a target of "."), then the final default
       server is <u>localhost</u>.

       The port can be any Perl port specification, default is <u><a href="../man4190/sieve.4190.html">sieve</a>(4190)</u>.  A port from an SRV record will take
       precedence.  The Perl specification provides a name to look up in the system services database
       (<u><a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a></u>) followed in parentheses by a default value to use if the name is not found.  Thus this
       default will honour a value of 2000 from <u><a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a></u>.

       The <b>--4</b> or <b>--6</b> options may be used to coerce IPv4 or IPv6.

       By default, the server is taken to be a domain, for which SRV records are looked up; use <b>--nosrv</b> to
       inhibit SRV record lookup.

       The <b>--user</b> option will be required unless you're on a Unix system with <u>getpwuid()</u> available and your
       Cyrus account name matches your system account name.  <b>--authmech</b> can be used to force a particular
       authentication mechanism.  <b>--authzid</b> can be used to request authorisation to act as the specified id.
       <b>--realm</b> can be used to try to pass realm information to the authentication mechanism.  If you want to
       provide a password programmatically, use <b>--passwordfd</b> to state which file descriptor (typically <u>0</u>) the
       password can be read from.  Everything until the newline before EOF is the password, so it can contain
       embedded newlines.  Do not provide passwords on a command-line or in a process environment.

       Unless modified at install/packaging time, by default SSL certificate authority certificates are searched
       for.  The first attempt is to try, in turn, for environment variables $SSL_CERT_DIR &amp; $SSL_CERT_FILE
       which are the names supported by the OpenSSL library and so often supported by client commands.  Next, if
       the OpenSSL command "version" is available and the output "OPENSSLDIR" can be parsed and the "certs"
       directory exists within that directory, then that location will be used.  Finally, a fixed list of common
       locations are searched and the first one to exist is used.  Invoking with <b>--debug</b> will show more details
       during the "setup:" phase.

       Precedence above these defaults is given to the <b>--tlscafile</b> option if given, else the <b>--tlscapath</b> option
       if that is given.  The former is one file containing certificates, the latter is a directory.

       Alternatively, if you are willing to accept the risk of man-in-the-middle active attacks and you are
       unable to arrange for the relevant Certificate Authority certificate to be available, then you can lower
       your safety with the <b>--notlsverify</b> option, also spelt <b>--nosslverify</b>.

       If verification is requested (the default) but TLS is not available, we do not fall back to cleartext
       insecure communications.  Use <b>--clearchan</b> to change that, or set
       $SIEVECONNECT_INSECURE_CLEARTEXT_FALLBACK non-empty in the environment.

       If you don't want to (only) rely on CA systems you can explicitly set an expected server certificate
       fingerprint using the <b>--tlscertfingerprint</b> option, also spelt <b>--sslcertfingerprint</b>.  If you wish to
       ignore CA validation, you still need to disable that explicitly (see above), as the default is to add an
       extra constraint (pinning, within valid CA certificates).  This option specifies the X.509 certificate
       fingerprint (not a public key fingerprint), as given by OpenSSL.  The first part of the value should be
       an algorithm name, such as "sha256" or "sha1".  That is followed by a colon, and then the fingerprint
       data in its usual colon-delimited hexadecimal notation.  Eg: "--tlscertfingerprint
       sha256:24:B4:..28-more-fields..:A8:58"

       For SSL client certificate authentication, either <b>--clientkeycert</b> may be used to refer to a file with
       both the key and cert present or both <b>--clientkey</b> and <b>--clientcert</b> should point to the relevant files.
       The data should be in PEM file-format.

       The <b>--noclearauth</b> option will prevent use of cleartext authentication mechanisms unless protected by TLS.
       The <b>--noclearchan</b> option will mandate use of some confidentiality layer; at this time only TLS is
       supported.

       By default, the server's "VERSION" capability will be used to filter the commands available.  Use
       <b>--ignoreserverversion</b> to prevent this.

       The remaining options denote actions.  One, and only one, action may be present.  If no action is
       present, the interactive mode is entered.  If the exec action is present, commands are read from the
       script instead.

       <b>--upload</b> will upload a script to the server.
       <b>--download</b> will download a script from the server.
       <b>--list</b> will list the scripts which exist on the server. One of those scripts might be marked ACTIVE.
       <b>--delete</b> will delete a script from the server.
       <b>--checkscript</b> will ask the server to validate the local file provided.
       <b>--edit</b> will download a script, invoke an editor upon it, ask the server to check the results (and offer
       to re-edit if the server rejects it) and finally upload the result.
       <b>--activate</b> will mark the specified remote script as the active one.
       <b>--deactivate</b> will remove the active mark from the specified remote script without activating a
       replacement.
       <b>--exec</b> will take a file-name containing commands as though given in the normal read-eval-print loop.

       Note   that   <b>--check</b>  and  <b>--edit</b>  require  a  server  which  advertises  a  "VERSION"  capability,  see
       <b>--ignoreserverversion</b> to override.

       (If <b>--server</b> is not  explicitly  stated,  it  may  be  provided  at  the  end  of  the  command-line  for
       compatibility with sieveshell.)

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Connect  to  a  Sieve  server  and  enter  interactive  mode, when you already have a Kerberos ticket and
       GSSAPI/Kerberos is available:

           $ sieve-connect --server imap.example.org
           ReadLine support enabled.
           &gt;

       Do the same, but with $IMAP_SERVER set in environ:

           $ sieve-connect
           ReadLine support enabled.
           &gt;

       Upload a script from the current directory, being prompted to authenticate; note that the script won't be
       activated (uploading just makes it available, possibly with  the  server  having  first  checked  it  for
       errors):

           $ sieve-connect --server imap.example.org --user <a href="mailto:fred@example.org">fred@example.org</a> \
                --localsieve fred.siv --upload
           Sieve/IMAP Password: [password here, not shown]
           $

       See a lot of what's happening under the covers:

           $ sieve-connect --debug
           [ snip 30 or so lines ]
           &gt;

       Use <b>--passwordfd</b> to supply the password using stdio instead of argv or environ, where it might show up in
       process listings; this example assumes a shell with "here-strings", such as zsh or bash:

           $   password='...'
           $ sieve-connect --authmech digest-md5 --passwordfd=5 5&lt;&lt;&lt;"$password"
           ReadLine support enabled.
           &gt;

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       $IMAP_SERVER for a default IMAP server.

       $USERNAME and $LOGNAME where the "getpwuid()" function is not available.

       $SSL_CERT_DIR and $SSL_CERT_FILE for locating default Certificate Authority trust anchors.

       $SIEVECONNECT_INSECURE_CLEARTEXT_FALLBACK to preserve old poor hygiene around TLS fallback.

       $VISUAL, else $EDITOR, for the edit action.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       If  the  authentication  protocol  negotiates  a  protection  layer  then  things will rapidly Go Bad.  A
       mitigating factor is that no protection layer should be  negotiated  whilst  under  STARTTLS  protection.
       Just use TLS!

       When  listing  scripts,  the  format  is  based upon the raw server output, assuming that the server uses
       quoted-strings for the script names.  The output is just passed back on the basis that it's a fairly good
       interface to pass to a program.  But a server could choose  to  use  literal  strings,  even  though  the
       results  are  defined  as  line-break  separated  --  that  would  mean that some linebreaks are special.
       Hopefully no server will do this.

       If <b>sieve-connect</b> fails to connect to an IPv4 server without the <b>-4</b> option being explicitly  passed,  then
       you've encountered a portability issue in the <u>IO::Socket::INET6</u> Perl library and need to upgrade that.

       Most  historical implementations used port 2000 for ManageSieve.  RFC5804 allocates port 4190.  This tool
       uses a port-spec of "<a href="../man4190/sieve.4190.html">sieve</a>(4190)" as the default port, which means that an <u><a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a></u> (or  substitute)
       entry  for "sieve" as a TCP service takes precedence, but if that is not present, will assume 4190 as the
       default.  This change means that if you're still using port 2000 and do not have an <u><a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a></u>  entry,
       updating  to/beyond  release  0.75  of this tool will break invocations which do not specify a port.  The
       specification of the default port was moved to the user-configurable section at the top of the script and
       administrators may wish to override the shipped default.  You can bypass all of this mess  by  publishing
       SRV records, per RFC5804.

       The  Net::DNS Perl module does not (at time of writing) provide full support for weighted prioritised SRV
       records and I have not made any effort to fix this; whatever the default sort algorithm provides for  SRV
       is what is used for ordering.

       If  you don't specify a server and don't export $IMAP_SERVER in the environment then the search mechanism
       is safer and more thorough if the <u>Mozilla::PublicSuffix</u> Perl module is installed. In particular, if  your
       hostname  is also your domain name and the parent domain is administered by someone you don't trust, then
       you'll regret not installing that module.

       Probably need to sit down and work through the final RFC and see if any functionality is still missing.

</pre><h4><b>NON-BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Actually uses STARTTLS.  Can handle script names with embedded whitespace.   Author  needs  access  to  a
       server which handles embedded quote characters properly to complete testing of that.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sieve-connect</b>  was  written  as  a demonstration for the "info-cyrus" mailing-list, 2006-11-14.  It was a
       single-action-and-quit script for scripting purposes.  The command-loop code was written (two days) later
       and deliberately designed to be compatible with sieveshell.

       Versions prior to 0.85 did not actually verify  the  peer  certificate  identity,  although  this  author
       stupidly believed that it did.  API/expectations mismatch.

       Versions  prior  to  0.88  defaulted  to  falling  back  to  cleartext  in  the absence of STARTTLS if CA
       information was configured locally and verification requested (the default).  Today, this  is  no  longer
       acceptable  for client-server communications; either verify-and-require-TLS or don't-verify-and-fallback-
       to-cleartext.  This is the new policy going forward; use <b>--clearchan</b> to allow fallback while still trying
       to    verify    TLS    (but    why?)    or    <b>--notlsverify</b>    to    skip    verification.     Or     add
       $SIEVECONNECT_INSECURE_CLEARTEXT_FALLBACK non-empty in the environment to avoid the implicit noclearchan-
       when-verify-enabled.

       Phil Pennock &lt;<a href="mailto:phil-perl@spodhuis.org">phil-perl@spodhuis.org</a>&gt; is guilty, m'Lud.

       There   is   a   low-volume   announcement   list   for   new   releases;   the   web   interface  is  at
       &lt;<a href="http://mail.globnix.net/mailman/listinfo/sieve-connect-announce">http://mail.globnix.net/mailman/listinfo/sieve-connect-announce</a>&gt;    or    you     can     send     mail,
       &lt;<a href="mailto:sieve-connect-announce-request@spodhuis.org">mailto:sieve-connect-announce-request@spodhuis.org</a>?subject=subscribe&gt;

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Releases  are  made  available  at  &lt;<a href="http://people.spodhuis.org/phil.pennock/software/">http://people.spodhuis.org/phil.pennock/software/</a>&gt;  in the form of a
       tarball and an associated detached PGP signature.  All releases are signed, always, and always have been.
       The signing key is in the PGP Strong Set (which means there's a stronger chance that you can  verify  the
       identity  of  the key owner).  Historically, releases were signed with key 0x403043153903637F.  If you're
       reading this text from a release, then I've cut a new release since switching to  key  0x4D1E900E14C1CC04
       and I expect that 4096RSA key to be used, barring major incident.

       The  source  code  is  available  via  Git;  the  authoritative  public-facing  repository  is  currently
       &lt;https://github.com/philpennock/sieve-connect&gt; and pull-requests and bug-reports are accepted there.

</pre><h4><b>PREREQUISITES</b></h4><pre>
       Perl.  <u>Authen::SASL</u>.  <u>IO::Socket::INET6</u>.  <u>IO::Socket::SSL</u> (at least version 1.14).  <u>Pod::Usage</u>.  <u>Net::DNS</u>
       for SRV lookup.  <u>Pod::Simple::Text</u> for built-in man command (optional).  <u>Term::ReadKey</u> to  get  passwords
       without  echo.   Various  other  Perl  modules  which  are  believed to be standard.  <u>Term::ReadLine</u> will
       significantly improve interactive mode.  <u>Term::ReadLine::Gnu</u> will improve it  further  by  allowing  tab-
       completion.  <u>Mozilla::PublicSuffix</u> is highly recommended and will improve security.

</pre><h4><b>INTEROPERABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sieve-connect</b>  is  regularly  tested  with  the  <b>timsieved</b> server distributed with the Cyrus IMAP server.
       Further interoperability testing is underway, more is desired (test accounts appreciated!).
