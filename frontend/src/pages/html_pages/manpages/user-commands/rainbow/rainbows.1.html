</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       rainbows - rackup-like command to launch Rainbows!

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       rainbows [-c CONFIG_FILE] [-E RACK_ENV] [-D] [RACKUP_FILE]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A  <a href="../man1/rackup.1.html">rackup</a>(1)-like  command  to launch Rack applications using Rainbows!.  It is expected to be started in
       your application root (APP_ROOT), but the "working_directory" directive may be used in the CONFIG_FILE.

       While Rainbows! takes a myriad of command-line options for compatibility with <a href="../man1/ruby.1.html">ruby</a>(1) and  <a href="../man1/rackup.1.html">rackup</a>(1),  it
       is recommended to stick to the few command-line options specified in the SYNOPSIS and use the CONFIG_FILE
       as much as possible.

</pre><h4><b>RACKUP</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       This  defaults  to  "config.ru" in APP_ROOT.  It should be the same file used by <a href="../man1/rackup.1.html">rackup</a>(1) and other Rack
       launchers, it uses the <u>Rack::Builder</u> DSL.

       Embedded  command-line  options  are  mostly  parsed  for  compatibility  with  <a href="../man1/rackup.1.html">rackup</a>(1)  but   strongly
       discouraged.

</pre><h4><b>UNICORN</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c,</b> <b>--config-file</b> <b>CONFIG_FILE</b>
              Path  to  the Unicorn-specific config file.  The config file is implemented as a Ruby DSL, so Ruby
              code may executed.  See the RDoc/ri for the <u>Unicorn::Configurator</u>  class  for  the  full  list  of
              directives available from the DSL.

       <b>-D,</b> <b>--daemonize</b>
              Run daemonized in the background.  The process is detached from the controlling terminal and stdin
              is  redirected  to  "/dev/null".   Unlike  many  common  UNIX daemons, we do not chdir to "/" upon
              daemonization to allow more control over the startup/upgrade process.   Unless  specified  in  the
              CONFIG_FILE, stderr and stdout will also be redirected to "/dev/null".

       <b>-E,</b> <b>--env</b> <b>RACK_ENV</b>
              Run under the given RACK_ENV.  See the RACK ENVIRONMENT section for more details.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--listen</b> <b>ADDRESS</b>
              Listens  on  a given ADDRESS.  ADDRESS may be in the form of HOST:PORT or PATH, HOST:PORT is taken
              to mean a TCP socket and PATH is meant to be  a  path  to  a  UNIX  domain  socket.   Defaults  to
              "0.0.0.0:8080"  (all  addresses  on  TCP  port  8080)  For  production deployments, specifying the
              "listen" directive in CONFIG_FILE is recommended as it allows fine-tuning of socket options.

       <b>-N,</b> <b>--no-default-middleware</b>
              Disables loading middleware implied by RACK_ENV.  This bypasses the  configuration  documented  in
              the    RACK    ENVIRONMENT    section,    but    still    allows   RACK_ENV   to   be   used   for
              application/framework-specific purposes.

</pre><h4><b>RACKUP</b> <b>COMPATIBILITY</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-o,</b> <b>--host</b> <b>HOST</b>
              Listen on a TCP socket belonging to HOST, default is  "0.0.0.0"  (all  addresses).   If  specified
              multiple  times on the command-line, only the last-specified value takes effect.  This option only
              exists for compatibility with the <a href="../man1/rackup.1.html">rackup</a>(1) command, use of "-l"/"--listen" switch is  recommended
              instead.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--port</b> <b>PORT</b>
              Listen  on  the  specified  TCP  PORT,  default  is  8080.   If  specified  multiple  times on the
              command-line,  only  the  last-specified  value  takes  effect.   This  option  only  exists   for
              compatibility with the <a href="../man1/rackup.1.html">rackup</a>(1) command, use of "-l"/"--listen" switch is recommended instead.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--server</b> <b>SERVER</b>
              No-op, this exists only for compatibility with <a href="../man1/rackup.1.html">rackup</a>(1).

</pre><h4><b>RUBY</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-e,</b> <b>--eval</b> <b>LINE</b>
              Evaluate  a  LINE  of Ruby code.  This evaluation happens immediately as the command-line is being
              parsed.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--debug</b>
              Turn on debug mode, the $DEBUG variable is set to true.

       <b>-w,</b> <b>--warn</b>
              Turn on verbose warnings, the $VERBOSE variable is set to true.

       <b>-I,</b> <b>--include</b> <b>PATH</b>
              specify <u>LOAD</u>~<u>P</u>~<u>ATH</u>.<u>PATHwillbeprependedto</u>LOAD_PATH.  The ':'  character  may  be  used  to  delimit
              multiple  directories.   This  directive  may be used more than once.  Modifications to $LOAD_PATH
              take place immediately and in the order they were specified on the command-line.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--require</b> <b>LIBRARY</b>
              require a specified LIBRARY before executing the application.  The  "require"  statement  will  be
              executed immediately and in the order they were specified on the command-line.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       The following UNIX signals may be sent to the master process:

       • HUP - reload config file, app, and gracefully restart all workers

       • INT/TERM - quick shutdown, kills all workers immediately

       • QUIT - graceful shutdown, waits for workers to finish their current request before finishing.

       • USR1  -  reopen  all logs owned by the master and all workers See Unicorn::Util.reopen_logs for what is
         considered a log.

       • USR2 - reexecute the running binary.  A separate QUIT should be sent to the original process  once  the
         child is verified to be up and running.

       • WINCH  -  gracefully  stops  workers  but  keep the master running.  This will only work for daemonized
         processes.

       • TTIN - increment the number of worker processes by one

       • TTOU - decrement the number of worker processes by one

       See the SIGNALS (https://yhbt.net/rainbows/SIGNALS.html) document for full  description  of  all  signals
       used by Rainbows!.

</pre><h4><b>RACK</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Accepted  values  of  RACK_ENV  and  the  middleware they automatically load (outside of RACKUP_FILE) are
       exactly as those in <a href="../man1/rackup.1.html">rackup</a>(1):

       • development - loads Rack::CommonLogger, Rack::ShowExceptions, and Rack::Lint middleware

       • deployment - loads Rack::CommonLogger middleware

       • none - loads no middleware at all, relying entirely on RACKUP_FILE

       All unrecognized values for RACK_ENV are assumed to  be  "none".   Production  deployments  are  strongly
       encouraged to use "deployment" or "none" for maximum performance.

       Note  the  Rack::ContentLength  and  Rack::Chunked  middlewares  are  also  loaded  by  "deployment"  and
       "development", but no other values of RACK_ENV.  If needed, they must be individually  specified  in  the
       RACKUP_FILE, some frameworks do not require them.
