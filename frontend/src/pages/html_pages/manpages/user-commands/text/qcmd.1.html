</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       qmv, qcp - Rename or copy files quickly, editing the file names in a text editor

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>qcp</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]... [<u>FILE</u>]...

       <b>qmv</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]... [<u>FILE</u>]...

       <b>qcmd</b> --command=<u>COMMAND</u> [<u>OPTION</u>]... [<u>FILE</u>]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page document describes the <b>qcp</b>, <b>qmv</b> and <b>qcmd</b> commands.

       The  <b>qmv</b>  program  allows  files  to  be renamed by editing their names in any text editor. By changing a
       letter in a text document, a letter in a filename can be changed. Since the files are listed  after  each
       other, common changes can be made more quickly.

       The <b>qcp</b> program works like qmv, but copies files instead of moving them.

       The  <b>qmv</b>  program  was  built  with  safety  in mind - bogus renames caused by human error are avoided by
       performing as many checks as possible.  Because of this, <b>qmv</b> supports an interactive mode where each step
       in the rename procedure can be executed manually. The default is to start <b>qmv</b>  in  non-interactive  mode.
       However,  when  there  is  a  conflict or error, <b>qmv</b> will drop to interactive mode (instead of losing all
       user-made changes). For more information on the renaming process and interactive mode,  see  below.  This
       also applies to <b>qcp</b>.

       The <b>qcmd</b> program works just like <b>qmv</b> and <b>qcp</b> but allows you to specify which command to execute.

       The  <b><a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</a></b>(1)  program is used to list files to rename or copy. Therefore <b>qmv</b>, <b>qcp</b>, and <b>qcmd</b> accepts some <b>ls</b>
       options.

</pre><h4><b>RENAMING/COPYING</b> <b>PROCESS</b></h4><pre>
       The process of renaming or copying files consists of many steps. They are:

       <b>List</b> <b>files</b>
              Generate a list files to rename from command-line arguments by using <b><a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</a></b>(1).

       <b>Create</b> <b>an</b> <b>editable</b> <b>text</b> <b>file</b>
              The edit format creates an editable text file with the file names.

       <b>Start</b> <b>the</b> <b>editor</b>
              Start the text editor and wait until the user has finished editing it.

       <b>Read</b> <b>the</b> <b>edited</b> <b>text</b> <b>file</b>
              The edit format reads the edited text file now with updated file names.

       <b>Check</b> <b>rename</b> <b>and</b> <b>reorder</b> <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>(qmv</b> <b>only)</b>
              This is a complicated step which involves the following tasks:

              Tag renames where the destination file already exists, renames where the old file is  now  missing
              or  inaccessible, and renames renames where the new name was not changed. Perform a topologic sort
              on the renames, so that renaming b-&gt;c, a-&gt;b is possible.  Resolve  cross  references  by  renaming
              into temporary names, so that renaming e-&gt;f, f-&gt;e (or e-&gt;f, f-&gt;g, g-&gt;e and so on) is possible.

              This step results in a plan of renames.

       <b>Display</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan.</b>
              Display the plan to the user.

       <b>Apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan.</b>
              Apply the plan by actually renaming or copying files (unless --dummy was specified).

       If  an  error  occurs  during  any of the above steps (except the first), <b>qmv</b>/<b>qcp</b> drops the user into the
       interactive mode. This way no changes should be  lost,  and  errors  can  be  corrected  manually  before
       continuing.  See below for a description of the interactive mode.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These  programs  follow  the  usual  GNU  command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes
       (`-').

       <b>-a,</b> <b>--all</b>
              (Passed to <b>ls</b>.) Do not hide entries starting with `.'.

       <b>-A,</b> <b>--almost-all</b>
              (Passed to <b>ls</b>.) Do not list implied `.' and `..'.

       <b>-B,</b> <b>--ignore-backups</b>
              (Passed to <b>ls</b>.) Do not list implied entries ending with `~'.

       <b>-c</b>     (Passed to <b>ls</b>.) Sort by ctime (time of last modification).

       <b>--command=</b><u>COMMAND</u>
              Execute <u>COMMAND</u> instead of mv or cp.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--directory</b>
              (Passed to <b>ls</b>.) List directory entires instead of contents.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--reverse</b>
              (Passed to <b>ls</b>.) Reverse order while sorting.

       <b>-R,</b> <b>--recursive</b>
              (Passed to <b>ls</b>.) List subdirectories recursively.

       <b>-S</b>     (Passed to <b>ls</b>.) Sort by file size.

       <b>--sort=</b><u>WORD</u>
              (Passed to <b>ls</b>.) Sort by extension (-X), none (-U), size (-S),  time  (-t),  version  (-v),  status
              (-c), time (-t), atime (-u), or access (-u).

       <b>--time=</b><u>WORD</u>
              (Passed  to  <b>ls</b>.)  If  sorting is done by time (--sort=time), sort by atime, access, use, ctime or
              status time.

       <b>-t</b>     (Passed to <b>ls</b>.) Sort by modification time.

       <b>-u</b>     (Passed to <b>ls</b>.) Sort by access time.

       <b>-U</b>     (Passed to <b>ls</b>.) Do not sort; list entries in directory order.

       <b>-X</b>     (Passed to <b>ls</b>.) Sort alphabetically by entry extension.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--format=</b><u>FORMAT</u>
              Change edit format of text file. See below for possible values.

       <b>-o,</b> <b>--options=</b><u>OPTIONS</u>
              Pass options to the selected edit format. <u>OPTIONS</u> is in the format

              <u>OPTION</u>[=<u>VALUE</u>][,<u>OPTION</u>[=<u>VALUE</u>]...]

              For a list of available options for each format, use --options=help or see below.

       <b>-i,</b> <b>--interactive</b>
              Start in command mode (see below for information on this mode).

       <b>-e,</b> <b>--editor=</b><u>PROGRAM</u>
              Specify program to edit text file with. The default program is determined by looking at the <b>VISUAL</b>
              environment variable, or if that is not set, the <b>EDITOR</b> environment variable. If that is  not  set
              either, use the program called <b>editor</b>.

       <b>--ls=</b><u>PROGRAM</u>
              Specify  path of the ls program. If you omit the directory, the executable will be searched for in
              the directories specified by the PATH environment variable.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Be more verbose about what is being done.

       <b>--dummy</b>
              Do everything as usually, except actually renaming any files ("dummy" mode).

       <b>--help</b> Show summary of options.

       <b>--version</b>
              Output version information and exit.

</pre><h4><b>EDIT</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       An edit format is responsible for generating a text file for editing, and parsing it  once  it  has  been
       edited. The default format is dual-column, but there are other formats as well.

       Not  all  edit  formats  take  the  same  options.  Therefore,  it is necessary to specify them using the
       --options (-o) option. This option takes a list of "suboptions" similar to the -o option in <b><a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a></b>(8).

       Available edit formats are `single-column' (or `sc'), `dual-column' (or `dc'), and `destination-only' (or
       `do'). The default format is dual-column.

</pre><h4><b>DUAL-COLUMN</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>dual-column</b> format (`dual-column' or `dc') displays files in two columns. This  is  the  default  and
       recommended  format.   The  leftmost column is usually the source file name (which should not be edited),
       and the rightmost column the destination file name.

       Supported options:

       <b>swap</b>   Swap location of old and new names when editing. I.e. the leftmost column is now  the  destination
              file name, and the rightmost the source file name.

       <b>separate</b>
              Put a blank line between all renames.

       <b>tabsize=</b><u>SIZE</u>
              By default, tab characters of size 8 are used to separate the columns.  With this option the width
              of these tab characters can be changed.

       <b>spaces</b> Use space characters instead of tab characters when indenting.

       <b>width=</b><u>WIDTH</u>
              This option specifies the character position (horizontally) which the second file name starts at.

       <b>autowidth</b>
              Normally, if the source file name is longer than <b>width</b> characters, the destination name is printed
              on the next line instead.  With this option enabled however, qmv/qcp will adjust the width so that
              source and destination file names can be displayed on one line.

              If  a width has been specified with <b>width</b> prior to <b>autowidth</b>, that width will be used as a minimum
              width.

              Example: Assume that <b>width=10,autowidth</b> is specified. Even if all source file  names  are  shorter
              than  five characters, the split width would be 10. If there had been one file name longer than 10
              characters, the final width would have been more than 10 characters.

              This option is enabled by default.

       <b>indicator1=</b><u>TEXT</u>
              Text to put before the first file name (column).

       <b>indicator2=</b><u>TEXT</u>
              Text to put before the second file name (column).

       <b>help</b>   Show summary of edit format options.

</pre><h4><b>SINGLE-COLUMN</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>single-column</b> format (`single-column' or `sc') displays files in a single column - first source  file
       name and on the next line the destination file name.

       Supported options:

       <b>swap</b>   Swap  location of old and new names when editing. I.e. the first line will contain the destination
              file name, and the next line the source file name.

       <b>separate</b>
              Put a blank line between all renames.

       <b>indicator1=</b><u>TEXT</u>
              Text to put before the first file name.

       <b>indicator2=</b><u>TEXT</u>
              Text to put before the second file name.

       <b>help</b>   Show summary of edit format options.

</pre><h4><b>DESTINATION-ONLY</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>destination-only</b> format (`destination-only' or `do') displays files only the destination  file  name,
       one  on  each  line. This format is generally not recommended, since the only way to identify source file
       name is by looking at the line number. But it may be useful with some text editors.

       Supported options:

       <b>separate</b>
              Put a blank line between all renames (file names).

</pre><h4><b>INTERACTIVE</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       In interactive mode <b>qmv</b>/<b>qcp</b> reads commands from the keyboard, parses them, and  executes  them.  This  is
       done using GNU readline.

       The following commands are available:

       <b>ls,</b> <b>list</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>].. [<u>FILES</u>]..
              Select  files  to  rename.  If  no files are specified, select all files in current directory. The
              accepted options are those which are passed to <b><a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</a></b>(1). Use `help ls' to display a list of these.

       <b>import</b> <u>FILE</u>
              Read files to rename from a text file. Each line should correspond to an existing file to rename.

       <b>ed,</b> <b>edit</b>
              Edit renames in a text editor. If this command has been run before, and not  `all'  is  specified,
              only edit renames with errors.

       <b>plan</b>   Display the current rename-plan. (This plan is created after `edit'.)

       <b>apply</b>  Apply  the  current  plan,  i.e.  rename  files. Only those files marked as OK in the plan will be
              renamed.

       <b>retry</b>  If some rename failed earlier during `apply', this command will try those renames again.

       <b>show</b>   Display the value of the specified configuration variable, or all variables if none specified. See
              below for a list of configuration variables.

       <b>set</b> VARIABLE VALUE
              Set the value of a configuration variable.

       <b>exit,</b> <b>quit</b>
              Exit the program. If there are unapplied changes, the user will be notified so,  and  it  will  be
              necessary to run this command an extra time to exit the program.

       <b>help</b> [<u>ls</u>|<u>usage</u>]
              If `ls' is specified, display list options. If `usage' is specified, display accepted command line
              options. Otherwise display help on commands in interactive mode.

       <b>version</b>
              Display version information.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following variables are available in interactive mode:

       <b>dummy</b> <u>BOOLEAN</u>

       <b>editor</b> <u>STRING</u>

       <b>format</b> <u>STRING</u>

       <b>options</b> <u>STRING</u>
              These variables corresponds to the options with the same name.

       <b>tempfile</b> <u>STRING</u>
              This  variable  contains  the name of the temporary file which is edited with `edit'. It cannot be
              set; only be read with `show'.

       A boolean value is specified as `0', `false', `no', `off' or `1', `true', `yes', and  `on'.  Strings  are
       specified without quotes.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Edit names of files in current directory.
            <b>qmv</b>

       Edit names of files with extension `.c'. Sort files by modification time.
            <b>qmv</b> <b>-t</b> <b>*.c</b>

       Edit names of files using the nedit editor and with column width 100.
            <b>qmv</b> <b>-enedit</b> <b>-owidth=100</b>
