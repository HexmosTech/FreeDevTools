</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ed — edit text

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       ed <b>[</b>-p <u>string</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b>-s<b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>file</u><b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>ed</u>  utility  is  a  line-oriented  text editor that uses two modes: <u>command</u> <u>mode</u> and <u>input</u> <u>mode</u>.  In
       command mode the input characters shall be interpreted as commands, and  in  input  mode  they  shall  be
       interpreted as text. See the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.

       If an operand is <b>'-'</b>, the results are unspecified.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>ed</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>12.2</u>, <u>Utility</u> <u>Syntax</u>
       <u>Guidelines</u>, except for the unspecified usage of <b>'-'</b>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-p</b> <u>string</u> Use  <u>string</u>  as  the  prompt  string when in command mode. By default, there shall be no prompt
                 string.

       <b>-s</b>        Suppress the writing of byte counts by <b>e</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>r</b>, and <b>w</b> commands and of the <b>'!'</b>  prompt  after  a
                 !<u>command</u>.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <u>file</u>      If  the  <u>file</u>  argument  is  given,  <u>ed</u>  shall  simulate  an <b>e</b> command on the file named by the
                 pathname, <u>file</u>, before accepting commands from the standard input.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       The standard input shall be a text file consisting of commands, as described in the EXTENDED  DESCRIPTION
       section.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The input files shall be text files.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>ed</u>:

       <u>HOME</u>      Determine the pathname of the user's home directory.

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> for the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_COLLATE</u>
                 Determine the locale for the behavior  of  ranges,  equivalence  classes,  and  multi-character
                 collating elements within regular expressions.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine  the  locale  for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files) and
                 the behavior of character classes within regular expressions.

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to  affect  the  format  and  contents  of  diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error and informative messages written to standard output.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>ed</u>  utility  shall  take the standard action for all signals (see the ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS section in
       <u>Section</u> <u>1.4</u>, <u>Utility</u> <u>Description</u> <u>Defaults</u>) with the following exceptions:

       SIGINT    The <u>ed</u> utility shall interrupt its current activity, write the string <b>"?\n"</b> to standard output,
                 and return to command mode (see the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section).

       SIGHUP    If the buffer is not empty and has changed since the last write, the <u>ed</u> utility  shall  attempt
                 to  write a copy of the buffer in a file. First, the file named <b>ed.hup</b> in the current directory
                 shall be used; if that fails, the file  named  <b>ed.hup</b>  in  the  directory  named  by  the  <u>HOME</u>
                 environment  variable shall be used. In any case, the <u>ed</u> utility shall exit without writing the
                 file to the currently remembered pathname and without returning to command mode.

       SIGQUIT   The <u>ed</u> utility shall ignore this event.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       Various editing commands and the prompting feature (see <b>-p</b>) write to standard output, as described in the
       EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The output files shall be text files whose formats are dependent on the editing commands given.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>ed</u> utility shall operate on a copy of the file it is editing; changes made to the copy shall have  no
       effect on the file until a <b>w</b> (write) command is given. The copy of the text is called the <u>buffer</u>.

       Commands  to  <u>ed</u>  have  a simple and regular structure: zero, one, or two <u>addresses</u> followed by a single-
       character <u>command</u>, possibly followed by parameters to that command. These addresses specify one  or  more
       lines  in  the buffer. Every command that requires addresses has default addresses, so that the addresses
       very often can be omitted. If the <b>-p</b> option is specified, the prompt string shall be written to  standard
       output before each command is read.

       In  general, only one command can appear on a line. Certain commands allow text to be input. This text is
       placed in the appropriate place in the buffer. While <u>ed</u> is accepting text, it is  said  to  be  in  <u>input</u>
       <u>mode</u>.  In  this  mode,  no  commands  shall  be  recognized; all input is merely collected. Input mode is
       terminated by entering a line consisting of two characters: a &lt;period&gt; (<b>'.'</b>)  followed  by  a  &lt;newline&gt;.
       This line is not considered part of the input text.

   <b>Regular</b> <b>Expressions</b> <b>in</b> <b>ed</b>
       The  <u>ed</u>  utility  shall support basic regular expressions, as described in the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>9.3</u>, <u>Basic</u> <u>Regular</u> <u>Expressions</u>.  Since regular expressions in <u>ed</u> are always matched
       against single lines (excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt; characters), never against any  larger  section
       of text, there is no way for a regular expression to match a &lt;newline&gt;.

       A null RE shall be equivalent to the last RE encountered.

       Regular  expressions  are  used  in  addresses to specify lines, and in some commands (for example, the <b>s</b>
       substitute command) to specify portions of a line to be substituted.

   <b>Addresses</b> <b>in</b> <b>ed</b>
       Addressing in <u>ed</u> relates to the current line. Generally, the current line is the last line affected by  a
       command. The current line number is the address of the current line. If the edit buffer is not empty, the
       initial value for the current line shall be the last line in the edit buffer; otherwise, zero.

       Addresses shall be constructed as follows:

        1. The &lt;period&gt; character (<b>'.'</b>)  shall address the current line.

        2. The &lt;dollar-sign&gt; character (<b>'$'</b>) shall address the last line of the edit buffer.

        3. The positive decimal number <u>n</u> shall address the <u>n</u>th line of the edit buffer.

        4. The  &lt;apostrophe&gt;-x  character pair (<b>"'x"</b>) shall address the line marked with the mark name character
           <u>x</u>, which shall be a lowercase letter from the portable character set. It shall be  an  error  if  the
           character  has not been set to mark a line or if the line that was marked is not currently present in
           the edit buffer.

        5. A BRE enclosed by &lt;slash&gt; characters (<b>'/'</b>) shall address the first line found by  searching  forwards
           from  the line following the current line toward the end of the edit buffer and stopping at the first
           line for which the line excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt; matches the BRE. The BRE consisting of  a
           null  BRE  delimited  by  a pair of &lt;slash&gt; characters shall address the next line for which the line
           excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt; matches the last BRE encountered. In addition, the second &lt;slash&gt;
           can be omitted at the end of a command line. Within the BRE, a &lt;backslash&gt;-&lt;slash&gt; pair (<b>"\/"</b>)  shall
           represent  a literal &lt;slash&gt; instead of the BRE delimiter. If necessary, the search shall wrap around
           to the beginning of the buffer and continue up to and including the current line, so that the  entire
           buffer is searched.

        6. A  BRE  enclosed by &lt;question-mark&gt; characters (<b>'?'</b>)  shall address the first line found by searching
           backwards from the line preceding the current line toward  the  beginning  of  the  edit  buffer  and
           stopping  at  the  first line for which the line excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt; matches the BRE.
           The BRE consisting of a null BRE delimited by a  pair  of  &lt;question-mark&gt;  characters  (<b>"??"</b>)  shall
           address the previous line for which the line excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt; matches the last BRE
           encountered.  In  addition,  the  second &lt;question-mark&gt; can be omitted at the end of a command line.
           Within the BRE, a &lt;backslash&gt;-&lt;question-mark&gt; pair (<b>"\?"</b>) shall represent a  literal  &lt;question-mark&gt;
           instead of the BRE delimiter. If necessary, the search shall wrap around to the end of the buffer and
           continue up to and including the current line, so that the entire buffer is searched.

        7. A  &lt;plus-sign&gt; (<b>'+'</b>) or &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; character (<b>'-'</b>) followed by a decimal number shall address the
           current line plus or minus the number. A &lt;plus-sign&gt; or &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; character not  followed  by  a
           decimal number shall address the current line plus or minus 1.

       Addresses can be followed by zero or more address offsets, optionally &lt;blank&gt;-separated.  Address offsets
       are constructed as follows:

        *  A  &lt;plus-sign&gt;  or  &lt;hyphen-minus&gt;  character  followed  by  a  decimal number shall add or subtract,
           respectively, the indicated number of lines to or from the address. A &lt;plus-sign&gt;  or  &lt;hyphen-minus&gt;
           character not followed by a decimal number shall add or subtract 1 to or from the address.

        *  A decimal number shall add the indicated number of lines to the address.

       It  shall not be an error for an intermediate address value to be less than zero or greater than the last
       line in the edit buffer. It shall be an error for the final address value to be less than zero or greater
       than the last line in the edit buffer. It shall be an error if a  search  for  a  BRE  fails  to  find  a
       matching line.

       Commands  accept  zero, one, or two addresses. If more than the required number of addresses are provided
       to a command that requires zero addresses, it shall be an error. Otherwise, if  more  than  the  required
       number  of addresses are provided to a command, the addresses specified first shall be evaluated and then
       discarded until the maximum number of valid addresses remain, for the specified command.

       Addresses shall be separated from each other by a &lt;comma&gt; (<b>','</b>) or &lt;semicolon&gt; character (<b>';'</b>).   In  the
       case of a &lt;semicolon&gt; separator, the current line (<b>'.'</b>)  shall be set to the first address, and only then
       will  the  second  address  be  calculated.  This  feature can be used to determine the starting line for
       forwards and backwards searches; see rules 5. and 6.

       Addresses can be omitted on either side of the &lt;comma&gt;  or  &lt;semicolon&gt;  separator,  in  which  case  the
       resulting address pairs shall be as follows:
                                             ┌───────────┬─────────────┐
                                             │ <b>Specified</b> │  <b>Resulting</b>  │
                                             ├───────────┼─────────────┤
                                             │ ,         │ 1 , $       │
                                             │ , addr    │ 1 , addr    │
                                             │ addr ,    │ addr , addr │
                                             │ ;         │ . ; $       │
                                             │ ; addr    │ . ; addr    │
                                             │ addr ;    │ addr ; addr │
                                             └───────────┴─────────────┘

       Any  &lt;blank&gt;  characters  included  between  addresses,  address  separators, or address offsets shall be
       ignored.

   <b>Commands</b> <b>in</b> <b>ed</b>
       In the following list of <u>ed</u> commands, the default addresses are  shown  in  parentheses.  The  number  of
       addresses  shown in the default shall be the number expected by the command. The parentheses are not part
       of the address; they show that the given addresses are the default.

       It is generally invalid for more than one command to appear on a line.  However, any command  (except  <b>e</b>,
       <b>E</b>,  <b>f</b>,  <b>q</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>r</b>, <b>w</b>, and <b>!</b>)  can be suffixed by the letter <b>l</b>, <b>n</b>, or <b>p</b>; in which case, except for the <b>l</b>, <b>n</b>,
       and <b>p</b> commands, the command shall be executed and then the new current line shall be written as described
       below under the <b>l</b>, <b>n</b>, and <b>p</b> commands. When an <b>l</b>, <b>n</b>, or <b>p</b> suffix is used with an <b>l</b>, <b>n</b>, or <b>p</b>  command,  the
       command  shall  write  to  standard  output  as described below, but it is unspecified whether the suffix
       writes the current line again in the requested format or whether the suffix has no effect.  For  example,
       the  <b>pl</b>  command  (base  <b>p</b> command with an <b>l</b> suffix) shall either write just the current line or write it
       twice—once as specified for <b>p</b> and once as specified for <b>l</b>.  Also, the <b>g</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>v</b>, and <b>V</b> commands shall  take
       a command as a parameter.

       Each  address  component  can  be  preceded by zero or more &lt;blank&gt; characters. The command letter can be
       preceded by zero or more &lt;blank&gt; characters. If a suffix letter (<b>l</b>, <b>n</b>, or <b>p</b>) is  given,  the  application
       shall ensure that it immediately follows the command.

       The  <b>e</b>,  <b>E</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>r</b>, and <b>w</b> commands shall take an optional <u>file</u> parameter, separated from the command letter
       by one or more &lt;blank&gt; characters.

       If changes have been made in the buffer since the last <b>w</b> command that wrote the entire buffer,  <u>ed</u>  shall
       warn  the user if an attempt is made to destroy the editor buffer via the <b>e</b> or <b>q</b> commands. The <u>ed</u> utility
       shall write the string:

           "?\n"

       (followed by an explanatory message if <u>help</u> <u>mode</u> has been enabled via the <b>H</b> command) to  standard  output
       and  shall  continue  in  command  mode  with the current line number unchanged. If the <b>e</b> or <b>q</b> command is
       repeated with no intervening command, it shall take effect.

       If a terminal disconnect (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Chapter</u> <u>11</u>,  <u>General</u>  <u>Terminal</u>
       <u>Interface</u>, Modem Disconnect and Closing a Device Terminal), is detected:

        *  If  accompanied  by  a  SIGHUP  signal, the <u>ed</u> utility shall operate as described in the ASYNCHRONOUS
           EVENTS section for a SIGHUP signal.

        *  If not accompanied by a SIGHUP signal, the <u>ed</u> utility  shall  act  as  if  an  end-of-file  had  been
           detected on standard input.

       If an end-of-file is detected on standard input:

        *  If  the  <u>ed</u> utility is in input mode, <u>ed</u> shall terminate input mode and return to command mode. It is
           unspecified if any partially entered lines (that is, input text without a terminating &lt;newline&gt;)  are
           discarded from the input text.

        *  If the <u>ed</u> utility is in command mode, it shall act as if a <b>q</b> command had been entered.

       If  the  closing  delimiter  of an RE or of a replacement string (for example, <b>'/'</b>) in a <b>g</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>s</b>, <b>v</b>, or <b>V</b>
       command would be the last character before a &lt;newline&gt;, that delimiter can be omitted, in which case  the
       addressed line shall be written. For example, the following pairs of commands are equivalent:

           s/s1/s2   s/s1/s2/p
           g/s1      g/s1/p
           ?s1       ?s1?

       If an invalid command is entered, <u>ed</u> shall write the string:

           "?\n"

       (followed  by  an explanatory message if <u>help</u> <u>mode</u> has been enabled via the <b>H</b> command) to standard output
       and shall continue in command mode with the current line number unchanged.

   <b>Append</b> <b>Command</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     (.)a
                     &lt;<u>text</u>&gt;
                     .

       The <b>a</b> command shall read the given text and append it after the addressed line; the current  line  number
       shall  become the address of the last inserted line or, if there were none, the addressed line. Address 0
       shall be valid for this command; it shall cause the appended text to be placed at the  beginning  of  the
       buffer.

   <b>Change</b> <b>Command</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     (.,.)c
                     &lt;<u>text</u>&gt;
                     .

       The  <b>c</b>  command  shall  delete the addressed lines, then accept input text that replaces these lines; the
       current line shall be set to the address of the last line input; or, if there  were  none,  at  the  line
       after  the  last line deleted; if the lines deleted were originally at the end of the buffer, the current
       line number shall be set to the address of the new last line; if no  lines  remain  in  the  buffer,  the
       current  line  number  shall  be  set  to  zero.  Address  0 shall be valid for this command; it shall be
       interpreted as if address 1 were specified.

   <b>Delete</b> <b>Command</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     (.,.)d

       The <b>d</b> command shall delete the addressed lines from the buffer. The address of the line  after  the  last
       line deleted shall become the current line number; if the lines deleted were originally at the end of the
       buffer,  the  current line number shall be set to the address of the new last line; if no lines remain in
       the buffer, the current line number shall be set to zero.

   <b>Edit</b> <b>Command</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     e <b>[</b><u>file</u><b>]</b>

       The <b>e</b> command shall delete the entire contents of the buffer and then read  in  the  file  named  by  the
       pathname <u>file</u>.  The current line number shall be set to the address of the last line of the buffer. If no
       pathname  is  given,  the  currently  remembered pathname, if any, shall be used (see the <b>f</b> command). The
       number of bytes read shall be written to standard output, unless the <b>-s</b>  option  was  specified,  in  the
       following format:

           "%d\n", &lt;<u>number</u> <u>of</u> <u>bytes</u> <u>read</u>&gt;

       The  name  <u>file</u>  shall  be remembered for possible use as a default pathname in subsequent <b>e</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>r</b>, and <b>w</b>
       commands. If <u>file</u> is replaced by <b>'!'</b>, the rest of the line shall be taken to  be  a  shell  command  line
       whose  output  is to be read. Such a shell command line shall not be remembered as the current <u>file</u>.  All
       marks shall be discarded upon the completion of a successful <b>e</b> command. If the buffer has  changed  since
       the last time the entire buffer was written, the user shall be warned, as described previously.

   <b>Edit</b> <b>Without</b> <b>Checking</b> <b>Command</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     E <b>[</b><u>file</u><b>]</b>

       The <b>E</b> command shall possess all properties and restrictions of the <b>e</b> command except that the editor shall
       not check to see whether any changes have been made to the buffer since the last <b>w</b> command.

   <b>Filename</b> <b>Command</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     f <b>[</b><u>file</u><b>]</b>

       If  <u>file</u> is given, the <b>f</b> command shall change the currently remembered pathname to <u>file</u>; whether the name
       is changed or not, it shall then write the (possibly new) currently remembered pathname to  the  standard
       output in the following format:

           "%s\n", &lt;<u>pathname</u>&gt;

       The current line number shall be unchanged.

   <b>Global</b> <b>Command</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     (1,$)g/<u>RE</u>/<u>command</u> <u>list</u>

       In the <b>g</b> command, the first step shall be to mark every line for which the line excluding the terminating
       &lt;newline&gt; matches the given RE. Then, going sequentially from the beginning of the file to the end of the
       file,  the given <u>command</u> <u>list</u> shall be executed for each marked line, with the current line number set to
       the address of that line. Any line modified by the <u>command</u> <u>list</u> shall be unmarked.  When  the  <b>g</b>  command
       completes, the current line number shall have the value assigned by the last command in the <u>command</u> <u>list</u>.
       If  there  were  no matching lines, the current line number shall not be changed. A single command or the
       first of a list of commands shall appear on the same line as the global command. All lines  of  a  multi-
       line list except the last line shall be ended with a &lt;backslash&gt; preceding the terminating &lt;newline&gt;; the
       <b>a</b>,  <b>i</b>,  and <b>c</b> commands and associated input are permitted. The <b>'.'</b>  terminating input mode can be omitted
       if it would be the last line of the <u>command</u> <u>list</u>. An empty <u>command</u> <u>list</u> shall  be  equivalent  to  the  <b>p</b>
       command.  The  use of the <b>g</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>v</b>, <b>V</b>, and <b>!</b>  commands in the <u>command</u> <u>list</u> produces undefined results. Any
       character other than &lt;space&gt; or &lt;newline&gt; can be used instead of a &lt;slash&gt; to delimit the RE. Within  the
       RE, the RE delimiter itself can be used as a literal character if it is preceded by a &lt;backslash&gt;.

   <b>Interactive</b> <b>Global</b> <b>Command</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     (1,$)G/<u>RE</u>/

       In the <b>G</b> command, the first step shall be to mark every line for which the line excluding the terminating
       &lt;newline&gt;  matches  the given RE. Then, for every such line, that line shall be written, the current line
       number shall be set to the address of that line, and any one command (other than one of the <b>a</b>, <b>c</b>,  <b>i</b>,  <b>g</b>,
       <b>G</b>,  <b>v</b>,  and  <b>V</b>  commands) shall be read and executed. A &lt;newline&gt; shall act as a null command (causing no
       action to be taken on the current line); an <b>'&amp;'</b> shall cause the re-execution of the most recent  non-null
       command  executed  within  the  current  invocation  of  <b>G</b>.   Note that the commands input as part of the
       execution of the <b>G</b> command can address and affect any lines in the  buffer.  Any  line  modified  by  the
       command  shall be unmarked. The final value of the current line number shall be the value set by the last
       command successfully executed. (Note that the last command successfully executed shall be the  <b>G</b>  command
       itself if a command fails or the null command is specified.) If there were no matching lines, the current
       line number shall not be changed. The <b>G</b> command can be terminated by a SIGINT signal. Any character other
       than  &lt;space&gt; or &lt;newline&gt; can be used instead of a &lt;slash&gt; to delimit the RE and the replacement. Within
       the RE, the RE delimiter itself can be used as a literal character if it is preceded by a &lt;backslash&gt;.

   <b>Help</b> <b>Command</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     h

       The <b>h</b> command shall write a short message to standard output that explains the reason for the most recent
       <b>'?'</b>  notification. The current line number shall be unchanged.

   <b>Help-Mode</b> <b>Command</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     H

       The <b>H</b> command shall cause <u>ed</u> to enter a mode in which help messages (see the <b>h</b> command) shall be  written
       to  standard output for all subsequent <b>'?'</b>  notifications. The <b>H</b> command alternately shall turn this mode
       on and off; it is initially off. If the help-mode is being turned on, the <b>H</b>  command  also  explains  the
       previous <b>'?'</b>  notification, if there was one. The current line number shall be unchanged.

   <b>Insert</b> <b>Command</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     (.)i
                     &lt;<u>text</u>&gt;
                     .

       The  <b>i</b> command shall insert the given text before the addressed line; the current line is set to the last
       inserted line or, if there was none, to the addressed line. This command differs from the <b>a</b> command  only
       in the placement of the input text. Address 0 shall be valid for this command; it shall be interpreted as
       if address 1 were specified.

   <b>Join</b> <b>Command</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     (.,.+1)j

       The  <b>j</b>  command  shall join contiguous lines by removing the appropriate &lt;newline&gt; characters. If exactly
       one address is given, this command shall do nothing. If lines are joined, the current line  number  shall
       be set to the address of the joined line; otherwise, the current line number shall be unchanged.

   <b>Mark</b> <b>Command</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     (.)k<u>x</u>

       The  <b>k</b>  command  shall  mark  the  addressed  line  with  name <u>x</u>, which the application shall ensure is a
       lowercase letter from the portable character set. The address <b>"'x"</b> shall then refer  to  this  line;  the
       current line number shall be unchanged.

   <b>List</b> <b>Command</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     (.,.)l

       The  <b>l</b>  command  shall  write  to standard output the addressed lines in a visually unambiguous form. The
       characters listed in the Base Definitions  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Table</u>  <u>5-1</u>,  <u>Escape</u>  <u>Sequences</u>  <u>and</u>
       <u>Associated</u>  <u>Actions</u>  (<b>'\\'</b>,  <b>'\a'</b>,  <b>'\b'</b>,  <b>'\f'</b>,  <b>'\r'</b>, <b>'\t'</b>, <b>'\v'</b>) shall be written as the corresponding
       escape sequence; the <b>'\n'</b> in that table is not applicable. Non-printable  characters  not  in  the  table
       shall  be  written as one three-digit octal number (with a preceding &lt;backslash&gt; character) for each byte
       in the character (most significant byte first).

       Long lines shall be folded, with the point of folding indicated by &lt;newline&gt; preceded by  a  &lt;backslash&gt;;
       the  length  at which folding occurs is unspecified, but should be appropriate for the output device. The
       end of each line shall be marked with a <b>'$'</b>, and <b>'$'</b> characters within the text shall be written  with  a
       preceding &lt;backslash&gt;.  An <b>l</b> command can be appended to any other command other than <b>e</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>q</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>r</b>, <b>w</b>,
       or <b>!</b>.  The current line number shall be set to the address of the last line written.

   <b>Move</b> <b>Command</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     (.,.)m<u>address</u>

       The  <b>m</b> command shall reposition the addressed lines after the line addressed by <u>address</u>.  Address 0 shall
       be valid for <u>address</u> and cause the addressed lines to be moved to the beginning of the buffer.  It  shall
       be  an  error  if address <u>address</u> falls within the range of moved lines. The current line number shall be
       set to the address of the last line moved.

   <b>Number</b> <b>Command</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     (.,.)n

       The <b>n</b> command shall write to standard output the addressed lines, preceding each line by its line  number
       and  a &lt;tab&gt;; the current line number shall be set to the address of the last line written. The <b>n</b> command
       can be appended to any command other than <b>e</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>q</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>r</b>, <b>w</b>, or <b>!</b>.

   <b>Print</b> <b>Command</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     (.,.)p

       The <b>p</b> command shall write to standard output the addressed lines; the current line number shall be set to
       the address of the last line written. The <b>p</b> command can be appended to any command other than <b>e</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>q</b>,
       <b>Q</b>, <b>r</b>, <b>w</b>, or <b>!</b>.

   <b>Prompt</b> <b>Command</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     P

       The <b>P</b> command shall cause <u>ed</u> to prompt with an &lt;asterisk&gt; (<b>'*'</b>) (or <u>string</u>, if <b>-p</b> is specified)  for  all
       subsequent  commands.  The <b>P</b> command alternatively shall turn this mode on and off; it shall be initially
       on if the <b>-p</b> option is specified; otherwise, off. The current line number shall be unchanged.

   <b>Quit</b> <b>Command</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     q

       The <b>q</b> command shall cause <u>ed</u> to exit. If the buffer has changed since the last time the entire buffer was
       written, the user shall be warned, as described previously.

   <b>Quit</b> <b>Without</b> <b>Checking</b> <b>Command</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     Q

       The <b>Q</b> command shall cause <u>ed</u> to exit without checking whether changes have been made in the buffer  since
       the last <b>w</b> command.

   <b>Read</b> <b>Command</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     ($)r <b>[</b><u>file</u><b>]</b>

       The  <b>r</b>  command shall read in the file named by the pathname <u>file</u> and append it after the addressed line.
       If no <u>file</u> argument is given, the currently remembered pathname, if any, shall be used (see the <b>e</b>  and  <b>f</b>
       commands). The currently remembered pathname shall not be changed unless there is no remembered pathname.
       Address 0 shall be valid for <b>r</b> and shall cause the file to be read at the beginning of the buffer. If the
       read  is  successful,  and  <b>-s</b>  was  not specified, the number of bytes read shall be written to standard
       output in the following format:

           "%d\n", &lt;<u>number</u> <u>of</u> <u>bytes</u> <u>read</u>&gt;

       The current line number shall be set to the address of the last line read in. If <u>file</u> is replaced by <b>'!'</b>,
       the rest of the line shall be taken to be a shell command line whose output is to be read. Such  a  shell
       command line shall not be remembered as the current pathname.

   <b>Substitute</b> <b>Command</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     (.,.)s/<u>RE</u>/<u>replacement</u>/<u>flags</u>

       The  <b>s</b>  command shall search each addressed line for an occurrence of the specified RE and replace either
       the first or all (non-overlapped) matched strings with the <u>replacement</u>; see the following description  of
       the  <b>g</b> suffix. It is an error if the substitution fails on every addressed line. Any character other than
       &lt;space&gt; or &lt;newline&gt; can be used instead of a &lt;slash&gt; to delimit the RE and the replacement.  Within  the
       RE,  the  RE delimiter itself can be used as a literal character if it is preceded by a &lt;backslash&gt;.  The
       current line shall be set to the address of the last line on which a substitution occurred.

       An &lt;ampersand&gt; (<b>'&amp;'</b>) appearing in the <u>replacement</u> shall be replaced by the string matching the RE on  the
       current  line.   The  special  meaning  of  <b>'&amp;'</b>  in  this  context  can  be suppressed by preceding it by
       &lt;backslash&gt;.  As a more general feature, the characters <b>'\n'</b>, where <u>n</u> is a digit, shall  be  replaced  by
       the  text  matched  by  the  corresponding back-reference expression. If the corresponding back-reference
       expression does not match, then the characters <b>'\n'</b> shall be replaced  by  the  empty  string.  When  the
       character  <b>'%'</b>  is  the  only  character  in  the  <u>replacement</u>,  the  <u>replacement</u> used in the most recent
       substitute command shall be used as the <u>replacement</u> in the current substitute command; if  there  was  no
       previous  substitute  command,  the  use  of <b>'%'</b> in this manner shall be an error. The <b>'%'</b> shall lose its
       special meaning when it is in a replacement string of more  than  one  character  or  is  preceded  by  a
       &lt;backslash&gt;.   For  each  &lt;backslash&gt;  encountered  in  scanning  <u>replacement</u>  from beginning to end, the
       following character shall lose its special meaning (if any). It is unspecified what  special  meaning  is
       given to any character other than &lt;backslash&gt;, <b>'&amp;'</b>, <b>'%'</b>, or digits.

       A  line  can  be  split  by substituting a &lt;newline&gt; into it. The application shall ensure it escapes the
       &lt;newline&gt; in the <u>replacement</u> by preceding it by &lt;backslash&gt;.  Such substitution cannot be done as part of
       a <b>g</b> or <b>v</b> <u>command</u> <u>list</u>.  The current line number shall be set to the address of the last line on  which  a
       substitution  is  performed. If no substitution is performed, the current line number shall be unchanged.
       If a line is split, a substitution shall be considered to have been performed on each of  the  new  lines
       for  the  purpose  of determining the new current line number. A substitution shall be considered to have
       been performed even if the replacement string is identical to the string that it replaces.

       The application shall ensure that the value of <u>flags</u> is zero or more of:

       <u>count</u>   Substitute for the <u>count</u>th occurrence only of the RE found on each addressed line.

       <b>g</b>       Globally substitute for all non-overlapping instances of the RE rather than just the  first  one.
               If both <b>g</b> and <u>count</u> are specified, the results are unspecified.

       <b>l</b>       Write  to  standard  output  the  final  line in which a substitution was made. The line shall be
               written in the format specified for the <b>l</b> command.

       <b>n</b>       Write to standard output the final line in which a substitution  was  made.  The  line  shall  be
               written in the format specified for the <b>n</b> command.

       <b>p</b>       Write  to  standard  output  the  final  line in which a substitution was made. The line shall be
               written in the format specified for the <b>p</b> command.

   <b>Copy</b> <b>Command</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     (.,.)t<u>address</u>

       The <b>t</b> command shall be equivalent to the <b>m</b> command, except that a copy of the addressed  lines  shall  be
       placed after address <u>address</u> (which can be 0); the current line number shall be set to the address of the
       last line added.

   <b>Undo</b> <b>Command</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     u

       The  <b>u</b>  command shall nullify the effect of the most recent command that modified anything in the buffer,
       namely the most recent <b>a</b>, <b>c</b>, <b>d</b>, <b>g</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>j</b>, <b>m</b>, <b>r</b>, <b>s</b>, <b>t</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>v</b>, <b>G</b>, or <b>V</b>  command.  All  changes  made  to  the
       buffer  by  a <b>g</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>v</b>, or <b>V</b> global command shall be undone as a single change; if no changes were made by
       the global command (such as with <b>g</b>/RE/<b>p</b>), the <b>u</b> command shall have no effect.  The  current  line  number
       shall be set to the value it had immediately before the command being undone started.

   <b>Global</b> <b>Non-Matched</b> <b>Command</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     (1,$)v/<u>RE</u>/<u>command</u> <u>list</u>

       This command shall be equivalent to the global command <b>g</b> except that the lines that are marked during the
       first step shall be those for which the line excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt; does not match the RE.

   <b>Interactive</b> <b>Global</b> <b>Not-Matched</b> <b>Command</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     (1,$)V/<u>RE</u>/

       This  command  shall  be  equivalent  to  the interactive global command <b>G</b> except that the lines that are
       marked during the first step shall be those for which the line excluding the terminating  &lt;newline&gt;  does
       not match the RE.

   <b>Write</b> <b>Command</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     (1,$)w <b>[</b><u>file</u><b>]</b>

       The  <b>w</b>  command  shall  write  the addressed lines into the file named by the pathname <u>file</u>.  The command
       shall create the file, if it does not exist, or shall replace the contents  of  the  existing  file.  The
       currently  remembered  pathname  shall  not  be  changed  unless  there is no remembered pathname.  If no
       pathname is given, the currently remembered pathname, if any, shall be used (see the <b>e</b> and  <b>f</b>  commands);
       the  current  line  number  shall be unchanged. If the command is successful, the number of bytes written
       shall be written to standard output, unless the <b>-s</b> option was specified, in the following format:

           "%d\n", &lt;<u>number</u> <u>of</u> <u>bytes</u> <u>written</u>&gt;

       If <u>file</u> begins with <b>'!'</b>, the rest of the line shall be taken to be a shell command  line  whose  standard
       input  shall  be  the  addressed  lines. Such a shell command line shall not be remembered as the current
       pathname. This usage of the write command with <b>'!'</b>  shall not be considered as a ``last  <b>w</b>  command  that
       wrote the entire buffer'', as described previously; thus, this alone shall not prevent the warning to the
       user if an attempt is made to destroy the editor buffer via the <b>e</b> or <b>q</b> commands.

   <b>Line</b> <b>Number</b> <b>Command</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     ($)=

       The line number of the addressed line shall be written to standard output in the following format:

           "%d\n", &lt;<u>line</u> <u>number</u>&gt;

       The current line number shall be unchanged by this command.

   <b>Shell</b> <b>Escape</b> <b>Command</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     !<u>command</u>

       The  remainder of the line after the <b>'!'</b>  shall be sent to the command interpreter to be interpreted as a
       shell command line. Within the text of that shell command line, the  unescaped  character  <b>'%'</b>  shall  be
       replaced  with the remembered pathname; if a <b>'!'</b>  appears as the first character of the command, it shall
       be replaced with the text of the previous shell command executed via <b>'!'</b>.  Thus, <b>"!!"</b>  shall  repeat  the
       previous  !<u>command</u>.  If any replacements of <b>'%'</b> or <b>'!'</b>  are performed, the modified line shall be written
       to the standard output before <u>command</u> is executed. The <b>!</b>  command shall write:

           "!\n"

       to standard output upon completion, unless the <b>-s</b> option is specified. The current line number  shall  be
       unchanged.

   <b>Null</b> <b>Command</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     (.+1)

       An  address  alone  on  a  line  shall cause the addressed line to be written. A &lt;newline&gt; alone shall be
       equivalent to <b>"+1p"</b>.  The current line number shall be set to the address of the written line.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion without any file or command errors.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       When an error in the input script is encountered, or when an error is detected that is a  consequence  of
       the data (not) present in the file or due to an external condition such as a read or write error:

        *  If the standard input is a terminal device file, all input shall be flushed, and a new command read.

        *  If the standard input is a regular file, <u>ed</u> shall terminate with a non-zero exit status.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Because of the extremely terse nature of the default error messages, the prudent script writer begins the
       <u>ed</u> input commands with an <b>H</b> command, so that if any errors do occur at least some clue as to the cause is
       made available.

       In earlier versions of this standard, an obsolescent <b>-</b> option was described. This is no longer specified.
       Applications  should  use the <b>-s</b> option. Using <b>-</b> as a <u>file</u> operand now produces unspecified results. This
       allows implementations to continue to support the former required behavior.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The initial description of this utility was adapted from the SVID. It contains some features not found in
       Version 7 or BSD-derived systems.  Some of the  differences  between  the  POSIX  and  BSD  <u>ed</u>  utilities
       include, but need not be limited to:

        *  The BSD <b>-</b> option does not suppress the <b>'!'</b>  prompt after a <b>!</b>  command.

        *  BSD does not support the special meanings of the <b>'%'</b> and <b>'!'</b>  characters within a <b>!</b>  command.

        *  BSD does not support the <u>addresses</u> <b>';'</b> and <b>','</b>.

        *  BSD  allows  the  command/suffix  pairs  <b>pp</b>,  <b>ll</b>,  and so on, which are unspecified in this volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017.

        *  BSD does not support the <b>'!'</b>  character part of the <b>e</b>, <b>r</b>, or <b>w</b> commands.

        *  A failed <b>g</b> command in BSD sets the line number to the last line searched if there are no matches.

        *  BSD does not default the <u>command</u> <u>list</u> to the <b>p</b> command.

        *  BSD does not support the <b>G</b>, <b>h</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>n</b>, or <b>V</b> commands.

        *  On BSD, if there is no inserted text, the insert command changes the current line to  the  referenced
           line -1; that is, the line before the specified line.

        *  On BSD, the <u>join</u> command with only a single address changes the current line to that address.

        *  BSD does not support the <b>P</b> command; moreover, in BSD it is synonymous with the <b>p</b> command.

        *  BSD does not support the <u>undo</u> of the commands <b>j</b>, <b>m</b>, <b>r</b>, <b>s</b>, or <b>t</b>.

        *  The  Version  7  <u>ed</u> command <b>W</b>, and the BSD <u>ed</u> commands <b>W</b>, <b>wq</b>, and <b>z</b> are not present in this volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017.

       The <b>-s</b> option was added to allow the functionality of the removed <b>-</b> option in a  manner  compatible  with
       the Utility Syntax Guidelines.

       In early proposals there was a limit, {ED_FILE_MAX}, that described the historical limitations of some <u>ed</u>
       utilities in their handling of large files; some of these have had problems with files larger than 100000
       bytes.  It was this limitation that prompted much of the desire to include a <u>split</u> command in this volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017. Since this limit was removed, this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires that  implementations
       document the file size limits imposed by <u>ed</u> in the conformance document. The limit {ED_LINE_MAX} was also
       removed; therefore, the global limit {LINE_MAX} is used for input and output lines.

       The  manner  in  which  the <b>l</b> command writes non-printable characters was changed to avoid the historical
       backspace-overstrike method. On video  display  terminals,  the  overstrike  is  ambiguous  because  most
       terminals  simply  replace overstruck characters, making the <b>l</b> format not useful for its intended purpose
       of unambiguously understanding the content of the line.  The  historical  &lt;backslash&gt;-escapes  were  also
       ambiguous.  (The  string  <b>"a\0011"</b>  could  represent  a  line  containing  those six characters or a line
       containing the three characters <b>'a'</b>, a byte with a binary value of 1, and a 1.) In  the  format  required
       here, a &lt;backslash&gt; appearing in the line is written as <b>"\\"</b> so that the output is truly unambiguous. The
       method of marking the ends of lines was adopted from the <u>ex</u> editor and is required for any line ending in
       &lt;space&gt;  characters;  the  <b>'$'</b>  is  placed on all lines so that a real <b>'$'</b> at the end of a line cannot be
       misinterpreted.

       Earlier versions of this standard allowed for implementations with bytes other than eight bits, but  this
       has been modified in this version.

       The  description of how a NUL is written was removed. The NUL character cannot be in text files, and this
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 should not dictate behavior in the case of undefined, erroneous input.

       Unlike some of the other editing utilities, the filenames accepted by the <b>E</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>R</b>, and <b>r</b> commands are not
       patterns.

       Early proposals stated that the <b>-p</b> option worked only when standard input was associated with a  terminal
       device.  This has been changed to conform to historical implementations, thereby allowing applications to
       interpose themselves between a user and the <u>ed</u> utility.

       The form of the substitute command that uses the <b>n</b> suffix was limited in  some  historical  documentation
       (where  this was described incorrectly as ``backreferencing''). This limit has been omitted because there
       is no reason why an editor processing lines of  {LINE_MAX}  length  should  have  this  restriction.  The
       command <b>s/x/X/2047</b> should be able to substitute the 2047th occurrence of <b>'x'</b> on a line.

       The  use  of  printing  commands  with printing suffixes (such as <b>pn</b>, <b>lp</b>, and so on) was made unspecified
       because BSD-based systems allow this, whereas System V does not.

       Some BSD-based systems exit immediately upon receipt of end-of-file if all of the lines in the file  have
       been  deleted.  Since this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 refers to the <b>q</b> command in this instance, such behavior
       is not allowed.

       Some historical implementations returned exit status zero even if command errors had  occurred;  this  is
       not allowed by this volume of POSIX.1‐2017.

       Some  historical  implementations  contained  a bug that allowed a single &lt;period&gt; to be entered in input
       mode as &lt;backslash&gt; &lt;period&gt; &lt;newline&gt;.  This is not allowed by <u>ed</u> because there  is  no  description  of
       escaping  any of the characters in input mode; &lt;backslash&gt; characters are entered into the buffer exactly
       as typed. The typical method of entering a single &lt;period&gt; has been to precede it with another  character
       and then use the substitute command to delete that character.

       It  is  difficult  under  some  modes of some versions of historical operating system terminal drivers to
       distinguish between an end-of-file condition and  terminal  disconnect.  POSIX.1‐2008  does  not  require
       implementations  to  distinguish  between the two situations, which permits historical implementations of
       the <u>ed</u> utility on historical platforms to conform. Implementations are encouraged to distinguish  between
       the two, if possible, and take appropriate action on terminal disconnect.

       Historically, <u>ed</u> accepted a zero address for the <b>a</b> and <b>r</b> commands in order to insert text at the start of
       the  edit  buffer.  When  the  buffer  was  empty  the  command  <b>.=</b>  returned zero. POSIX.1‐2008 requires
       conformance to historical practice.

       For consistency with the <b>a</b> and <b>r</b> commands and better user functionality, the <b>i</b> and <b>c</b> commands  must  also
       accept an address of 0, in which case 0<u>i</u> is treated as 1<u>i</u> and likewise for the <b>c</b> command.

       All of the following are valid addresses:

       +++         Three lines after the current line.

       /<u>pattern</u>/-  One line before the next occurrence of pattern.

       -2          Two lines before the current line.

       3 ---- 2    Line one (note the intermediate negative address).

       1 2 3       Line six.

       Any  number  of  addresses can be provided to commands taking addresses; for example, <b>"1,2,3,4,5p"</b> prints
       lines 4 and 5, because two is the greatest valid number of addresses accepted by the <b>print</b> command. This,
       in combination with the &lt;semicolon&gt; delimiter, permits users to create commands based on ordered patterns
       in the file. For example, the command <b>"3;/foo/;+2p"</b> will  display  the  first  line  after  line  3  that
       contains  the  pattern  <u>foo</u>,  plus the next two lines. Note that the address <b>"3;"</b> must still be evaluated
       before being discarded, because the search origin for the <b>"/foo/"</b> command depends on this.

       Historically, <u>ed</u> disallowed  address  chains,  as  discussed  above,  consisting  solely  of  &lt;comma&gt;  or
       &lt;semicolon&gt;  separators; for example, <b>",,,"</b> or <b>";;;"</b> were considered an error. For consistency of address
       specification, this restriction is removed. The following table lists  some  of  the  address  forms  now
       possible:

       Historically, <u>ed</u> accepted the <b>'^'</b> character as an address, in which case it was identical to the &lt;hyphen-
       minus&gt; character. POSIX.1‐2008 does not require or prohibit this behavior.
