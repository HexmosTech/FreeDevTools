       pod2text - Convert POD data to formatted ASCII text

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       pod2text [<b>-aclostu</b>] [<b>--code</b>] [<b>-e</b> <u>encoding</u>]
           [<b>--errors</b>=<u>style</u>] [<b>--guesswork</b>=<u>rule</u>[,<u>rule</u>...]]
           [<b>-i</b> <u>indent</u>] [<b>-q</b> <u>quotes</u>]

       pod2text <b>-h</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pod2text</b> is a wrapper script around the Pod::Text and its subclasses.  It uses them to generate formatted
       text from POD source.  It can optionally use either termcap sequences or ANSI color escape sequences to
       format the text.

       <u>input</u> is the file to read for POD source (the POD can be embedded in code).  If <u>input</u> isn't given, it
       defaults to "STDIN".  <u>output</u>, if given, is the file to which to write the formatted output.  If <u>output</u>
       isn't given, the formatted output is written to "STDOUT".  Several POD files can be processed in the same
       <b>pod2text</b> invocation (saving module load and compile times) by providing multiple pairs of <u>input</u> and
       <u>output</u> files on the command line.

       By default, the output encoding is the same as the encoding of the input file, or UTF-8 if that encoding
       is not set (except on EBCDIC systems).  See the <b>-e</b> option to explicitly set the output encoding and
       "Encoding" in Pod::Text for more discussion.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Each option is annotated with the version of podlators in which that option was added with its current
       meaning.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--alt</b>
           [1.00]  Use  an  alternate output format that, among other things, uses a different heading style and
           marks "=item" entries with a colon in the left margin.

       <b>--code</b>
           [1.11] Include any non-POD text from the input file in the output as well.  Useful for  viewing  code
           documented with POD blocks with the POD rendered and the code left intact.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--color</b>
           [1.00]  Format  the  output  with  ANSI  color  escape  sequences.   Using  this option requires that
           Term::ANSIColor be installed on your system.

       <b>-e</b> <u>encoding</u>, <b>--encoding</b>=<u>encoding</u>
           [5.00] Specifies the encoding of the output.  <u>encoding</u> must be an encoding recognized by  the  Encode
           module (see Encode::Supported).  If the output contains characters that cannot be represented in this
           encoding,  that  is  an  error  that will be reported as configured by the "errors" option.  If error
           handling is other than "die",  the  unrepresentable  character  will  be  replaced  with  the  Encode
           substitution character (normally "?").

           WARNING:  The  input  encoding of the POD source is independent from the output encoding, and setting
           this option does not affect the interpretation of the POD input.  Unless your POD source is US-ASCII,
           its encoding should be declared with the "=encoding" command in the source, as near to the top of the
           file as possible.  If this is not done, Pod::Simple will will attempt to guess the encoding  and  may
           be  successful  if  it's  Latin-1  or  UTF-8,  but it will produce warnings.  See <b><a href="../man1/perlpod.1.html">perlpod</a></b>(1) for more
           information.

       <b>--errors</b>=<u>style</u>
           [2.5.0] Set the error handling style.  "die" says to throw an exception on any POD formatting  error.
           "stderr"  says  to  report  errors  on  standard error, but not to throw an exception.  "pod" says to
           include a POD ERRORS section in the resulting documentation summarizing the errors.   "none"  ignores
           POD errors entirely, as much as possible.

           The default is "die".

       <b>--guesswork</b>=<u>rule</u>[,<u>rule</u>...]
           [5.01]  By  default,  <b>pod2text</b>  applies  some default formatting rules based on guesswork and regular
           expressions that are intended to make writing Perl documentation easier  and  require  less  explicit
           markup.   These  rules may not always be appropriate, particularly for documentation that isn't about
           Perl.  This option allows turning all or some of it off.

           The special rule "all" enables all guesswork.  This is also the default  for  backward  compatibility
           reasons.  The special rule "none" disables all guesswork.  Otherwise, the value of this option should
           be a comma-separated list of one or more of the following keywords:

           quoting
               If  no  guesswork  is  enabled,  any text enclosed in C&lt;&gt; is surrounded by double quotes in nroff
               (terminal) output unless the contents are already quoted.  When this guesswork is enabled,  quote
               marks  will  also  be suppressed for Perl variables, function names, function calls, numbers, and
               hex constants.

           Any unknown guesswork name is silently ignored (for potential future compatibility),  so  be  careful
           about spelling.

       <b>-i</b> <u>indent</u>, <b>--indent=</b><u>indent</u>
           [1.00]  Set  the  number  of  spaces  to indent regular text, and the default indentation for "=over"
           blocks.  Defaults to 4 spaces if this option isn't given.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           [1.00] Print out usage information and exit.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--loose</b>
           [1.00] Print a blank line after a "=head1"  heading.   Normally,  no  blank  line  is  printed  after
           "=head1",  although  one is still printed after "=head2", because this is the expected formatting for
           manual pages; if you're formatting arbitrary text documents, using this option is recommended.

       <b>-m</b> <u>width</u>, <b>--left-margin</b>=<u>width</u>, <b>--margin</b>=<u>width</u>
           [1.24] The width of the left margin in spaces.  Defaults to 0.  This is  the  margin  for  all  text,
           including headings, not the amount by which regular text is indented; for the latter, see <b>-i</b> option.

       <b>--nourls</b>
           [2.5.0]  Normally,  L&lt;&gt;  formatting  codes  with a URL but anchor text are formatted to show both the
           anchor text and the URL.  In other words:

               L&lt;foo|<a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a>&gt;

           is formatted as:

               foo &lt;<a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a>&gt;

           This flag, if given, suppresses the URL when anchor text is given, so this example would be formatted
           as just "foo".  This can produce less cluttered output in cases where the URLs are  not  particularly
           important.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--overstrike</b>
           [1.06]  Format  the  output with overstrike printing.  Bold text is rendered as character, backspace,
           character.  Italics and file names are rendered as underscore, backspace,  character.   Many  pagers,
           such as <b>less</b>, know how to convert this to bold or underlined text.

       <b>-q</b> <u>quotes</u>, <b>--quotes</b>=<u>quotes</u>
           [4.00] Sets the quote marks used to surround C&lt;&gt; text to <u>quotes</u>.  If <u>quotes</u> is a single character, it
           is  used as both the left and right quote.  Otherwise, it is split in half, and the first half of the
           string is used as the left quote and the second is used as the right quote.

           <u>quotes</u> may also be set to the special value "none", in which case no quote marks are added around C&lt;&gt;
           text.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--sentence</b>
           [1.00] Assume each sentence ends with two spaces and try to  preserve  that  spacing.   Without  this
           option, all consecutive whitespace in non-verbatim paragraphs is compressed into a single space.

       <b>--stderr</b>
           [2.1.3]  By default, <b>pod2text</b> dies if any errors are detected in the POD input.  If <b>--stderr</b> is given
           and no <b>--errors</b> flag is present, errors are sent to standard error,  but  <b>pod2text</b>  does  not  abort.
           This is equivalent to "--errors=stderr" and is supported for backward compatibility.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--termcap</b>
           [1.00] Try to determine the width of the screen and the bold and underline sequences for the terminal
           from  termcap,  and  use  that  information  in formatting the output.  Output will be wrapped at two
           columns less than the width of your terminal device.  Using this option  requires  that  your  system
           have  a  termcap  file  somewhere  where  Term::Cap can find it and requires that your system support
           termios.  With this option, the output of <b>pod2text</b> will contain terminal control sequences  for  your
           current terminal type.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--utf8</b>
           [2.2.0]  Set the output encoding to UTF-8.  This is equivalent to "--encoding=UTF-8" and is supported
           for backward compatibility.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--width=</b><u>width</u>, <b>-</b><u>width</u>
           [1.00] The column at which to wrap text on the right-hand side.  Defaults to 76, unless <b>-t</b> is  given,
           in which case it's two columns less than the width of your terminal device.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       As  long  as  all  documents processed result in some output, even if that output includes errata (a "POD
       ERRORS" section generated with "--errors=pod"), <b>pod2text</b>  will  exit  with  status  0.   If  any  of  the
       documents  being  processed  do  not  result in an output document, <b>pod2text</b> will exit with status 1.  If
       there are syntax errors in a POD document being processed and the error handling  style  is  set  to  the
       default of "die", <b>pod2text</b> will abort immediately with exit status 255.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       If  <b>pod2text</b>  fails  with  errors,  see Pod::Text and Pod::Simple for information about what those errors
       might mean.  Internally, it can also produce the following diagnostics:

       -c (--color) requires Term::ANSIColor be installed
           (F) <b>-c</b> or <b>--color</b> were given, but Term::ANSIColor could not be loaded.

       Unknown option: %s
           (F) An unknown command line option was given.

       In addition, other Getopt::Long error messages may result from invalid command-line options.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       COLUMNS
           If <b>-t</b> is given, <b>pod2text</b> will take the current width of your screen from this  environment  variable,
           if available.  It overrides terminal width information in TERMCAP.

       TERMCAP
           If <b>-t</b> is given, <b>pod2text</b> will use the contents of this environment variable if available to determine
           the correct formatting sequences for your current terminal device.
