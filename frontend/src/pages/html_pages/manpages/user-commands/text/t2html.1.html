         3. An Emacs mode tinytf.el for writing the text files (optional)
         https://github.com/jaalto/project--emacs-tiny-tools

       <b>Requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>ascii</b> <b>files</b>

       The file must be written in Technical Format, whose layout is described in the this manual. Basically the
       idea is simple and there are only two heading levels: one at column 0 and the other at column 4 (halfway
       between the tab width). Standard text starts at column 8 (the position after pressed tab-key).

       The idea of technical format is that each column represents different rendering layout in the generated
       HTML. There is no special markup needed in the text file, so you can use the text version as a master
       copy of a FAQ etc. Bullets, numbered lists, word emphasis and quotation etc. can expressed in natural
       way.

       <b>HTML</b> <b>description</b>

       The generated HTML includes embedded Cascading Style Sheet 2 (CSS2) and a small piece of Java code. The
       CSS2 is used to colorize the page loyout and to define suitable printing font sizes. The generated HTML
       also takes an approach to support XHTML. See page <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/">http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/</a>#guidelines where the
       backward compatibility recommendations are outlined:

           Legal HTML          XHTML requires
           &lt;P&gt;                 &lt;p&gt; ..&lt;/p&gt;
           &lt;BR&gt;                &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
           &lt;HR&gt;                &lt;hr&gt;&lt;/hr&gt;

       XHTML does not support fragment identifiers #foo, with the "name" element, but uses "id" instead. For
       backward compatibility both elements are defined:

           &lt; ..name="tag"&gt;     Is now &lt;.. name="tag" id="tag"&gt;

       NOTE: This program was never designed to be used for XHTML and the strict XHTML validity is not to be
       expected.

       <b>Motivation</b>

       The easiest format to write large documents, like FAQs, is text. A text file offers WysiWyg editing and
       it can be turned easily into HTML format.  Text files are easily maintained and there is no requirements
       for special text editors. Any text editor like notepad, vi, Emacs can be used to maintain the documents.

       Text files are also the only sensible format if documents are kept under version control like RCS, CVS,
       SVN, Arch, Perforce, ClearCase. They can be asily compared with diff and patches can be easily received
       and sent to them.

       To help maintining large documents, there is also available an <u>Emacs</u> minor mode, package called
       <u>tinytf.el</u>, which offers text fontification with colors, Indentation control, bullet filling, heading
       renumbering, word markup, syntax highlighting etc.  See
       https://github.com/jaalto/project--emacs-tiny-tools

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Html:</b> <b>Header</b> <b>and</b> <b>Footer</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>--as-is</b>
           Any  extra  HTML  formatting  or  text manipulation is suppressed. Text is preserved as it appears in
           file. Use this option if you plan to deliver or and print the text as seen.

               o  If file contains "Table of Contents" it is not removed
               o  Table of Content block is not created (it usually would)

       <b>--author</b> <b>-a</b> <b>STR</b>
           Author of document e.g. <b>--author</b> <b>"John</b> <b>Doe"</b>

       <b>--disclaimer-file</b> FILE
           The text that appears at the footer is read from this file. If not given the default  copyright  text
           is added. Options "--quiet" and "--simple" suppress disclaimers.

       <b>--document</b> <b>FILE</b>
           <b>Name</b>  of  the  document  or  filename.  You could list all alternative URLs to the document with this
           option.

       <b>--email</b> <b>-e</b> <b>EMAIL</b>
           The contact address of the author of the document. Must be pure email address with  no  "&lt;"  and  "&gt;"
           characters included. Eg.  <b>--email</b> <b><a href="mailto:foo@example.com">foo@example.com</a></b>

               --email "&lt;<a href="mailto:me@here.com">me@here.com</a>&gt;"     WRONG
               --email "<a href="mailto:me@here.com">me@here.com</a>"       right

       <b>--simple</b> <b>-s</b>
           Print minimum footer only: contact, email and date. Use "--quiet" to completely discard footer.

       <b>--t2html-tags</b>
           Allow processing embedded #T2HTML-&lt;tag&gt; directives inside file. See full explanation by reading topic
           "EMBEDDED  DIRECTIVES INSIDE TEXT". By default, you do not need to to supply this option - it is "on"
           by default.

           To disregard embedded directives in text file, supply "no" option: <b>--not2html-tags</b>.

       <b>--title</b> <b>STR</b> <b>-t</b> <b>STR</b>
           The title text that appears in top frame of browser.

       <b>--url</b> <b>URL</b>

       Location of the HTML file. When <b>--document</b> gave the name, this gives the location.  This  information  is
       printed at the Footer.

   <b>Html:</b> <b>Navigation</b> <b>urls</b>
       <b>--base</b> <b>URL</b>
           URL  location of the HTML file in the <b>destination</b> <b>site</b> where it will be put available. This option is
           needed only if the document is hosted on a FTP server  (rare,  but  possible).  A  FTP  server  based
           document  cannot use Table Of Contents links (fragment <u>#tag</u> identifiers) unless HTML tag BASE is also
           defined.

           The argument can be full URL to the document:

               --base <a href="ftp://ftp.example.com/file.html">ftp://ftp.example.com/file.html</a>
               --base <a href="ftp://ftp.example.com/">ftp://ftp.example.com/</a>

       <b>--button-heading-top</b>
           Add additional <b>[toc]</b> navigation button to the end of each heading. This may be useful  in  long  non-
           framed HTML files.

       <b>--button-top</b> <b>URL</b>
           Buttons  are  placed  at  the  top of document in order: [previous][top][next] and <u>--button-*</u> options
           define the URLs.

           If URL is string <u>none</u> then no button is inserted. This may be handy if the buttons are defined  by  a
           separate program. And example using Perl:

               #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>

               my $top   = "index.html";             # set defaults
               my $prev  = "none";
               my $next  = "none";

               # ... somewhere $prev or $next may get set, or then not

               qx(t2html --button-top "$top" --button-prev "$prev" --button-next "$next" ...);

               # End of sample program

       <b>--button-prev</b> <b>URL</b>
           URL to go to previous document or string <u>none</u>.

       <b>--button-next</b> <b>URL</b>
           URL to go to next document or string <u>none</u>.

       <b>--reference</b> <b>tag=value</b>
           You  can  add  any custom references (tags) inside text and get them expand to any value. This option
           can be given multiple times and every occurrence of TAG is  replaced  with  VALUE.  E.g.  when  given
           following options:

               --reference "#HOME-URL=<a href="http://www.example.com/dir">http://www.example.com/dir</a>"
               --reference "#ARCHIVE-URL=<a href="http://www.example.com/dir/dir2">http://www.example.com/dir/dir2</a>"

           When referenced in text, the generated HTML includes expanded expanded to values. An example text:

                   The homepage is #HOME-URL/page.html and the mirrot page it at
                   #ARCHIVE-URL/page.html where you can find the latest version.

       <b>-R,</b> <b>--reference-separator</b> <b>STRING</b>
           See above. String that is used to split the TAG and VALUE. Default is equal sign "=".

       <b>-T,</b> <b>--toc-url-print</b>
           Display  URLs  (constructed from headings) that build up the Table of Contents (NAME AHREF tags) in a
           document. The list is outputted to stderr, so that it can be separated:

               % t2html --toc-url-print tmp.txt &gt; file.html 2&gt; toc-list.txt

           Where would you need this? If you want to know the fragment identifies for your file,  you  need  the
           list of names.

             <a href="http://www.example.com/myfile.html">http://www.example.com/myfile.html</a>#fragment-identifier

   <b>Html:</b> <b>Controlling</b> <b>CSS</b> <b>generation</b> <b>(HTML</b> <b>tables)</b>
       <b>--css-code-bg</b>
           This  option affects how the code section (column 12) is rendered. Normally the section is surrounded
           with a &lt;pre&gt;..&lt;/pre&gt; codes, but with this options, something  more  fancier  is  used.  The  code  is
           wrapped inside a &lt;table&gt;...&lt;/table&gt; and the background color is set to a shade of gray.

       <b>--css-code-note</b> <b>"REGEXP"</b>
           Option  <b>--css-code-bg</b>  is  required  to  activate  this  option.  A special word defined using regexp
           (default is 'Note:') will mark code sections specially.  The "first  word"  is  matched  against  the
           supplied Perl regexp.

           The  supplied  regexp  must  not, repeat, must not, include any matching group operators. This simply
           means, that grouping parenthesis like "(one|two|three)" are not allowed. You must use the  Perl  non-
           grouping  ones  like  "(?:one|two|three)".  Please  refer  to perl manual page [perlre] if this short
           introduction did not give enough rope.

           With this options, instead of rendering column 12 text with &lt;pre&gt;..&lt;/pre&gt;, the text appears just like
           regular text, but with a twist. The background color of the text has been changed to darker  grey  to
           visually stand out form the text.

           An    example    will    clarify.    Suppose    that    you    passed   options   <b>--css-code-bg</b>   and
           <b>--css-code-note='(?:Notice|Note):'</b>, which instructed to treat  the  first  paragraphs  at  column  12
           differently. Like this:

               This is the regular text that appears somewhere at column 8.
               It may contain several lines of text in this paragraph.

                   Notice: Here is the special section, at column 12,
                   and the first word in this paragraph is 'Notice:'.
                   Only that makes this paragraph at column 12 special.

               Now, we have some code to show to the user:

                   for ( i = 0; i++; i &lt; 10 )
                   {
                       //  Doing something in this loop
                   }

           One  note, text written with initial special word, like "Notice:", must all fit in one full pragraph.
           Any other paragraphs that follow, are rendered as code sections. Like here:

               This is the regular text that appears somewhere
               It may contain several lines of text in this paragraph

                   Notice: Here is the special section, at column 12,
                   and the first word in this paragraph is 'Notice:'
                   which makes it special

                   Hoewver, this paragraph IS NOT rendered specially
                   any more. Only the first paragraph above.

                   for ( i = 0; i++; i &lt; 10 )
                   {
                       //  Doing something in this loop
                   }

           As if this were not enough, there are some special table control directives that let you control  the
           &lt;table&gt;..&lt;/table&gt; which is put around the code section at column 12. Here are few examples:

               Here is example 1

                   #t2html::td:bgcolor=#F7F7DE

                   for ( i = 0; i++; i &lt; 10 )
                   {
                       //  Doing something in this loop
                   }

               Here is example 2

                   #t2html::td:bgcolor=#F7F7DE:tableborder:1

                   for ( i = 0; i++; i &lt; 10 )
                   {
                       //  Doing something in this loop
                   }

               Here is example 3

                   #t2html::td:bgcolor="#FFFFFF":tableclass:dashed

                   for ( i = 0; i++; i &lt; 10 )
                   {
                       //  Doing something in this loop
                   }

               Here is example 4

                   #t2html::td:bgcolor="#FFFFFF":table:border=1_width=94%_border=0_cellpadding="10"_cellspacing="0"

                   for ( i = 0; i++; i &lt; 10 )
                   {
                       //  Doing something in this loop
                   }

           Looks  cryptic?  Cannot help that and in order for you to completely understand what these directives
           do, you need to undertand what elements can be added to the &lt;table&gt; and &lt;td&gt; tokens.  Refer  to  HTML
           specification for available attributes. Here is briefing what you can do:

           The start command is:

               #t2html::
                       |
                       After this comes attribute pairs in form key:value
                       and multiple ones as key1:value1:key2:value2 ...

           The "key:value" pairs can be:

               td:ATTRIBUTES
                  |
                  This is converted into &lt;td attributes&gt;

               table:ATTRIBUTES
                     |
                     This is converted into &lt;table attributes&gt;

           There  can  be  no spaces in the ATTRIBUTES, because the "First-word" must be one contiguous word. An
           underscore can be used in place of space:

               table:border=1_width=94%
                     |
                     Interpreted as &lt;table border="1" width="94%"&gt;

           It is also possible to change the default CLASS style with word "tableclass". In order the  CLASS  to
           be  useful,  its  CSS  definitions  must  be  either  in the default configuration or supplied from a
           external file.  See option <b>--script-file</b>.

               tableclass:name
                          |
                          Interpreted as &lt;table class="name"&gt;

           For example, there are couple of default styles that can be used:

               1) Here is CLASS "dashed" example

                   #t2html::tableclass:dashed

                       for ( i = 0; i++; i &lt; 10 )
                       {
                           //  Doing something in this loop
                       }

               2) Here is CLASS "solid" example:

                   #t2html::tableclass:solid

                       for ( i = 0; i++; i &lt; 10 )
                       {
                           //  Doing something in this loop
                       }

           You can change any individual value of the default table definition which is:

               &lt;table  class="shade-note"&gt;

           To change e.g. only value cellpadding, you would say:

                #t2html::table:tablecellpadding:2

           If you are unsure what all of these were about, simply run program with <b>--test-page</b> and look  at  the
           source and generated HTML files. That should offer more rope to experiment with.

       <b>--css-file</b> <b>FILE</b>
           Include  &lt;LINK  ...&gt; which refers to external CSS style definition source.  This option is ignored if
           <b>--script-file</b> option has been given, because that option imports whole content inside HEAD tag.  This
           option can appear multiple times and the external CSS files are added in listed order.

       <b>--css-font-type</b> <b>CSS-DEFINITION</b>
           Set  the  BODY  element's  font  definition  to CSS-DEFINITION. The default value used is the regular
           typeset used in newspapers and books:

               --css-font-type='font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;'

       <b>--css-font-size</b> <b>CSS-DEFINITION</b>
           Set the body element's font size to CSS-DEFINITION. The default font size is expressed in points:

               --css-font-size="font-size: 12pt;"

   <b>Html:</b> <b>Controlling</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>document</b>
       <b>--delete</b> <b>REGEXP</b>
           Delete lines matching perl REGEXP. This is useful if you use some document tool that uses  navigation
           tags in the text file that you do not want to show up in generated HTML.

       <b>--delete-email-headers</b>
           Delete  email  headers  at the beginning of file, until first empty line that starts the body. If you
           keep your document ready for Usenet news posting, they may contain headers and body:

               From: ...
               Newsgroups: ...
               X-Sender-Info:
               Summary:

               BODY-OF-TEXT

       <b>--nodelete-default</b>
           Use this option to suppress default text deletion (which is on).

           Emacs "folding.el" package and vi can be used with any text or programming language to place sections

       <b>-F,</b> <b>--html-frame</b> <b>[FRAME-PARAMS]</b>
           If  given,  then  three  separate HTML files are generated. The left frame will contain TOC and right
           frame contains rest of the text. The <u>FRAME-PARAMS</u> can be any valid parameters for HTML tag  FRAMESET.
           The default is "cols="25%,75%"".

           Using this implies <b>--out</b> option automatically, because three files cannot be printed to stdout.

       <b>--language</b> <b>ID</b>
           Use  language ID, a two character ISO identifier like "en" for English during the generation of HTML.
           This only affects the text that is shown to end-user, like text  "Table  Of  contents".  The  default
           setting is "en". See section "SEE ALSO" for standards ISO 639 and ISO 3166 for proper codes.

           The selected language changes propgram's internal arrays in two ways: 1) Instead of default "Table of
           ocntents"  heading  the  national langaugage equivalent will be used 2) The text "Pic" below embedded
           sequentially numbered pictures will use natinal equivalent.

           If your languagae is not supported, please send the phrase for "Table of contents" and word "Pic"  in
           your language to the maintainer.

       <b>--script-file</b> <b>FILE</b>
           Include java code that must be complete &lt;script...&gt;&lt;/script&gt; from FILE. The code is put inside &lt;head&gt;
           of each HTML.

           The  <b>--script-file</b> is a general way to import anything into the HEAD element. Eg. If you want to keep
           separate style definitions for all, you could only import a pointer to a  style  sheet.   See  <u>14.3.2</u>
           <u>Specifying</u> <u>external</u> <u>style</u> <u>sheets</u> in HTML 4.0 standard.

       <b>--meta-keywords</b> <b>STR</b>
           Meta keywords. Used by search engines. Separate kwywords like "AA, BB, CC" with commas. Refer to HTML
           4.01 specification and topic "7.4.4 Meta data" and see <a href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/wilbur/">http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/wilbur/</a> and

               --meta-keywords "AA,BB,CC"

       <b>--meta-description</b> <b>STR</b>
           Meta  description.  Include  description string, max 1000 characters. This is used by search engines.
           Refer to HTML 4.01 specification and topic "7.4.4 Meta data"

       <b>--name-uniq</b>
           First 1-4 words from the heading are used for the HTML <u>name</u> tags.  However, it is possible  that  two
           same  headings start with exactly the same 1-4 words. In those cases you have to turn on this option.
           It will use counter 00 - 999 instead of words from headings to construct HTML <u>name</u> references.

           Please use this option only in emergencies, because referring to jump block <u>name</u> via

               httpI://example.com/doc.html#header_name

           is more convenient than using obscure reference

               httpI://example.com/doc.html#11

           In addition, each time you add a new heading the number changes, whereas  the  symbolic  name  picked
           from heading stays as long as you do not change the heading. Think about welfare of your netizens who
           bookmark you pages.  Try to make headings to not have same subjects and you do not need this option.

   <b>Document</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>and</b> <b>batch</b> <b>job</b> <b>commands</b>
       <b>-A,</b> <b>--auto-detect</b>
           Convert  file  only  if  tag  "#T2HTML-"  is found from file. This option is handy if you run a batch
           command to convert all files to HTML, but only if they look like HTML base files:

               find . -name "*.txt" -type f \
                    -exec t2html --auto-detect --verbose --out {} \;

           The command searches all *.txt files under current directory and feeds them  to  conversion  program.
           The  <b>--auto-detect</b>  only converts files which include "#T2HTML-" directives. Other text files are not
           converted.

       <b>--link-check</b> <b>-l</b>
           Check all http and ftp links.  <u>This</u> <u>option</u> <u>is</u> <u>supposed</u>  <u>to</u>  <u>be</u>  <u>run</u>  <u>standalone</u>  Option  <b>--quiet</b>  has
           special meaning when used with link check.

           With  this  option  you  can  regularly  validate your document and remove dead links or update moved
           links. Problematic links are outputted to <u>stderr</u>.  This link check feature is available only  if  you
           have the LWP web library installed. Program will check if you have it at runtime.

           Links  that  are  big, e.g. which match <u>tar.gz</u> <u>.zip</u> <u>...</u> or that run programs (links with ? character)
           are ignored because the GET request used in checking would return whole content of the  link  and  it
           would.  be too expensive.

           A suggestion: When you put binary links to your documents, add them with space:

               <a href="http://example.com/dir/dir/">http://example.com/dir/dir/</a> filename.tar.gz

           Then  the  program <u>does</u> check the http addresses. Users may not be able to get the file at one click,
           checker can validate at least the directory. If you are not  the  owner  of  the  link,  it  is  also
           possible that the file has moved of new version name has appeared.

       <b>-L,</b> <b>--link-check-single</b>
           Print condensed output in <u>grep</u> <u>-n</u> like manner <u>FILE:LINE:MESSAGE</u>

           This  option  concatenates the url response text to single line, so that you can view the messages in
           one line. You can use programming tools (like Emacs M-x compile) that can parse standard grep  syntax
           to jump to locations in your document to correct the links later.

       <b>-o,</b> <b>--out</b>
           write generated HTML to file that is derived from the input filename.

               --out --print /dir/file            --&gt; /dir/file.html
               --out --print /dir/file.txt        --&gt; /dir/file.html
               --out --print /dir/file.this.txt   --&gt; /dir/file.this.html

       <b>--link-cache</b> <b>CACHE_FILE</b>
           When links are checked periodically, it would be quite a rigorous to check every link every time that
           has  already  succeeded.  In  order  to  save  link  checking time, the "ok" links can be cached into
           separate file. Next time you check the links, the cache is opened and only links found that were  not
           in  the  cache  are  checked.  This should dramatically improve long searches. Consider this example,
           where every text file is checked recursively.

               $ t2html --link-check-single \
                 --quiet --link-cache ~tmp/link.cache \
                 `find . -name "*.txt" -type f`

       <b>-O,</b> <b>--out-dir</b> <b>DIR</b>
           Like <b>--out</b>, but chop the directory part and write output files to DIR. The following  would  generate
           the HTML file to current directory:

               --out-dir .

           If  you have automated tool that fills in the directory, you can use word <b>none</b> to ignore this option.
           The following is a no-op, it will not generate output to directory "none":

               --out-dir none

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--print</b>
           Print filename to stdout after HTML processing. Normally program  prints  no  file  names,  only  the
           generated HTML.

               % t2html --out --print page.txt

               --&gt; page.html

       <b>-P,</b> <b>--print-url</b>
           Print  filename  in  URL format. This is useful if you want to check the layout immediately with your
           browser.

               % t2html --out --print-url page.txt | xargs lynx

               --&gt; file: /users/foo/txt/page.html

       <b>--split</b> <b>REGEXP</b>
           Split document into smaller pieces when REGEXP matches. <u>Split</u> <u>commands</u> <u>are</u> <u>standalone</u>, meaning,  that
           it starts and quits. No HTML conversion for the file is engaged.

           If REGEXP is found from the line, it is a start point of a split. E.g. to split according to toplevel
           headings, which have no numbering, you would use:

               --split '^[A-Z]'

           A sequential numbers, 3 digits, are added to the generated partials:

               filename.txt-NNN

           The  split  feature  is  handy  if  you  want  to  generate slides from each heading: First split the
           document, then convert each part to HTML and finally print each part (page) separately to printer.

       <b>-S1,</b> <b>--split1</b>
           This is shorthand of <b>--split</b> command. Define regexp to split on toplevel heading.

       <b>-S2,</b> <b>--split2</b>
           This is shorthand of <b>--split</b> command. Define regexp to split on second level heading.

       <b>-SN,</b> <b>--split-named-files</b>
           Additional directive for split commands. If you split e.g. by headings using <b>--split1</b>,  it  would  be
           more  informative  to  generate filenames according to first few words from the heading name. Suppose
           the heading names where split occur were:

               Program guidelines
               Conclusion

           Then the generated partial filenames would be as follows.

               FILENAME-program_guidelines
               FILENAME-conclusion

       <b>-X,</b> <b>--xhtml</b>
           Render using strict XHTML. This means using &lt;hr/&gt;, &lt;br/&gt; and paragraphs use &lt;p&gt;..&lt;/p&gt;.

           "Note: this option is experimental. See BUGS"

   <b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>--debug</b> <b>LEVEL</b>
           Turn on debug with positive LEVEL number. Zero means no debug.

       <b>--help</b> <b>-h</b>
           Print help screen. Terminates program.

       <b>--help-css</b>
           Print default CSS used. Terminates program. You can copy and modify this output and instruct  to  use
           your  own  with  <b>--css-file=FILE</b>.   You  can  also  embed  the  option to files with "#T2HTML-OPTION"
           directive.

       <b>--help-html</b>
           Print help in HTML format. Terminates program.

       <b>--help-man</b>
           Print help page in Unix manual page format. You want to feed this output to <b>nroff</b> <b>-man</b>  in  order  to
           read it. Terminates program.

       <b>--test-page</b>
           Print the test page: HTML and example text file that demonstrates the capabilities.

       <b>--time</b>
           Print to stderr time spent used for handling the file.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b> <b>[LEVEL]</b>
           Print verbose messages.

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b>
           Print  no footer at all. This option has different meaning if <u>--link-check</u> option is turned on: print
           only erroneous links.

       <b>V,</b> <b>--version</b>
           Print program version information.

</pre><h4><b>FORMAT</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Program converts text files to HTML. The basic idea is to rely on indentation level, and the layout  used
       is  called  'Technical  format'  (TF)  where  only minimal conventions are used to mark italic, bold etc.
       text. The Basic principles can be demonstrated below. Notice the column poisiton ruler at the top:

        --//-- description start

         The column positions 1,2,3 are currently undefined and may not
         format correctly. Do not place text at columns 1,2 or 3.

            Heading level 2 starts at half-tab column 4 with a big letter

             Normal but colored text at columns 5

              Normal but colored text at columns 6

               Heading 3 can be considered at position TAB minus 1, column 7.

               "Special &lt;em&gt; text at column 7 starts with double quote"

                Standard text starts at column 8, you can *emphatize* text or
                make it _strong_ and write =SmallText= or +BigText+ show
                variable name `ThisIsAlsoVariable'. You can `_*nest*_' `the'

        --//-- description end

       That is it, there is the whole layout described. More formally the rules of text formatting are  secribed
       below.

   <b>USED</b> <b>HEADINGS</b>
       •   There  are  only  <u>two</u>  heading levels in this style. Heading columns are 0 and 4 and the heading must
           start with big letter ("Heading") or number ("1.0 Heading")

       •   At column 4, if the text starts with small letter, that line is interpreted as &lt;strong&gt;

       •   A HTML &lt;hr&gt; mark is added just before printing heading at level 1.

       •   The headings are gathered, the TOC is built and inserted to the beginning  of  HTML  page.  The  HTML
           &lt;name&gt;  references  used  in  TOC  are the first 4 sequential words from the headings. Make sure your
           headings are uniquely named, otherwise there will be same NAME  references  in  the  generated  HTML.
           Spaces  are converted into underscore when joining the words. If you can not write unique headings by
           four words, then you must use <b>--name-uniq</b> switch

</pre><h4><b>TEXT</b> <b>PLACEMENT</b> <b>RULES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>General</b>
       The basic rules for positioning text in certain columns:

       •   Text at column 1 is undefined if it does not start with big letter  or  number  to  indicate  Heading
           level 1.

       •   Text between columns 2 and 3 is marked with &lt;em&gt;

       •   Column 4 is reserved for heading level 2

       •   Text between columns 5-7 is marked with &lt;strong&gt;

       •   Text at column 7 is &lt;em&gt; if the first character is double quote.

       •   Column 10 is reserved for &lt;em&gt; text. If you want to quote someone or to add reference text, place the
           text in this column.

       •   Text at columns 9 and 11 are marked with &lt;strong&gt;

       Column 8 for text and special codes

       •   Column 8 is reserved for normal text

       •   At the start of text, at column 8, there can be DOT-code or COMMA-code.

       Column 12 is special

       •   Column  12  is  treated specially: block is started with &lt;pre&gt; and lines are marked as &lt;samp&gt;&lt;/samp&gt;.
           When the last text at <u>column</u> 12 is found, the block is closed with &lt;/pre&gt;. An example:

               txt txt txt         ;evenly placed block, fine, do it like this
               txt txt

               txt txt txt txt     ;Can not terminate the /pre, because last
               txt txt txt txt     ;column is not at 12
                   txt txt txt txt

               txt txt txt txt
               txt txt txt txt
                   txt txt txt txt
               ;; Finalizing comment, now the text is evenly placed

   <b>Additional</b> <b>tokens</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> <b>at</b> <b>column</b> <b>8</b>
       •   If there is "."(dot) at the beginning of a line and immediately non-whitespace,  then  &lt;br&gt;  code  is
           added to the end of line.

               .This line will have a &lt;BR&gt; HTML tag at the end.
               While these two line are joined together
               by the browser, depending on the frame width.

       •   If  there  is  ","(comma) then the &lt;p&gt; code is not inserted if the previous line is empty. If you use
           both "."(dot) and ","(comma), they must be in order dot-comma. The ","(comma) works differently if it
           is used in bullet

           A &lt;p&gt; is always added if there is separation of paragraphs, but when you are writing a bullet,  there
           is a problem, because a bullet exist only as long as text is kept together

               *   This is a bullet and it has all text ketp together
                   even if there is another line in the bullet.

           But  to  write  bullets  tat  spread  multiple  paragraphs,  you must instruct that those are to kept
           together and the text in next paragraph is not &lt;sample&gt; while it is placed at column 12

               *   This is a bullet and it has all text ketp together
                   ,even if there is another line in the bullet.

                   This is new paragrah to the previous bullet and this is
                   not a text sample. See continued COMMA-code above.

               *   This is new bullet

                   // and this is code sample after bullet
                   if ( $flag ) { ..do something.. }

   <b>Special</b> <b>text</b> <b>markings</b>
       italic, bold, code, small, big tokens
               _this_      is interpreted as &lt;strong class='word'&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt;
               *this*      is interpreted as &lt;em class='word'&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;
               `this'      is interpreted as &lt;sample class='word'&gt;this&lt;/sample&gt; `

           Exra modifiers that can be mixed with the above. Usually if you  want  bigger  font,  CAPITALIZE  THE
           WORDS.

               =this=      is interpreted as &lt;span class="word-small"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;
               +this+      is interpreted as &lt;span class="word-big"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;
               [this]      is interpreted as &lt;span class="word-ref"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;

       superscripting
               word[this]  is interpreted as superscript. You can use like
                           this[1], multiple[(2)] and almost any[(ab)] and
                           imaginable[IV superscritps] as long as the left
                           bracket is attached to the word.

       subscripting
               12[[10]]    is representation of value 12 un base 10.
                           This is interpreted as subscript. You can use like
                           this[[1]], multiple[[(2)]] and almost any[[(ab)]] and
                           imaginable[[IV superscritps]] as long as *two* left
                           brackets are attached to the word.

       embedding standard HTML tokens
           Stanadard  special HTML entities can be added inside text in a normal way, either using sybolic names
           or the hash code. Here are exmples:

               &amp;times; &amp;lt; &amp;gt; &amp;le; &amp;ge; &amp;ne; &amp;radic; &amp;minus;
               &amp;alpha; &amp;beta; &amp;gamma; &amp;divide;
               &amp;laquo; &amp;raquo; &amp;lsaquo; &amp;rsaquo; - &amp;ndash; &amp;mdash;
               &amp;asymp; &amp;equiv; &amp;sum; &amp;fnof; &amp;infin;
               &amp;deg; &amp;plusmn;
               &amp;trade; &amp;copy; &amp;reg;
               &amp;euro; &amp;pound; &amp;yen;

       embedding PURE HTML into text
           <b>This</b> <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> <b>experimental</b>. It is possible to embed pure  HTML  inside  text  in  occasions,
           where  e.g. some special formatting is needed. The idea is simple: you write HTML as usual but double
           every '&lt;' and '&gt;' characters, like:

               &lt;&lt;p&gt;&gt;

           The other rule is that all PURE HTML must be kept together. There must be no line breaks between pure
           HTML lines. This is incorrect:

               &lt;&lt;table&gt;&gt;

                   &lt;&lt;tr&gt;&gt;one
                   &lt;&lt;tr&gt;&gt;two

               &lt;&lt;/table&gt;&gt;

           The pure HTML must be written without extra newlines:

               &lt;&lt;table&gt;&gt;
                   &lt;&lt;tr&gt;&gt;one
                   &lt;&lt;tr&gt;&gt;two
               &lt;&lt;/table&gt;&gt;

           This "doubling" affects normal text writing rules as well. If you write documents, where you describe
           Unix styled HERE-documents, you MUST NOT put the tokens next to each other:

                   bash$ cat&lt;&lt;EOF              # DON'T, this will confuse parser.
                   one
                   EOF

           You must write the above code example using spaces to prevent "&lt;&lt;" from interpreting as PURE HTML:

                   bash$ cat &lt;&lt; EOF            # RIGHT, add spaces
                   one
                   EOF

       drawing a short separator
           A !! (two exclamation marks) at text column (position 8) causes adding immediate &lt;hr&gt; code. any  text
           after  !! in the same line is written with &lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt; and inserted just after &lt;hr&gt; code, therefore
           the word formatting commands have no effect in this line.

   <b>Http</b> <b>and</b> <b>email</b> <b>marking</b> <b>control</b>
       •   All http and ftp references as well as &lt;<a href="mailto:foo@example.com">foo@example.com</a>&gt; email addresses are marked clickable.  Email
           must have surrounding &lt;&gt; characters to be recognized.

       •   If  url  is preceded with hyphen, it will not be clickable. If a string foo, bar, quux, test, site is
           found from url, then it is not counted as clickable.

               &lt;<a href="mailto:me@here.com">me@here.com</a>&gt;                   clickable
               <a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>              clickable

               &lt; <a href="mailto:me@here.com">me@here.com</a>&gt;                  not clickable; contains space
               &lt;5dko56$<a href="mailto:1@news02.deltanet.com">1@news02.deltanet.com</a>&gt;  Message-Id, not clickable

               -<a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>             hyphen, not clickable
               http://$EXAMPLE                 variable. not clickable

   <b>Lists</b> <b>and</b> <b>bullets</b>
       •   The bulletin table is constructed if there is "o" or "*" at column 8 and 3 spaces after it,  so  that
           text  starts  at  column 12. Bulleted lines are advised to be kept together; no spaces between bullet
           blocks.

               *   This is a bullet
               *   This is a bullte

           Another example:

               o   This is a bullet
               o   This is a bullet

           List example:

               .   This is an ordered list
               .   This is an ordered list

       •   The ordered list is started with ".", a dot, and written like bullet where text starts at column 12.

   <b>Line</b> <b>breaks</b>
       •   All line breaks are visible in your document, do not  use  more  than  one  line  break  to  separate
           paragraphs.

       •   Very important is that there is only <u>one</u> line break after headings.

</pre><h4><b>EMBEDDED</b> <b>DIRECTIVES</b> <b>INSIDE</b> <b>TEXT</b></h4><pre>
       Command line options
           You can cancel obeying all embedded directives by supplying option <b>--not2html-tags</b>.

           You  can  include  these lines anywhere in the document and their content is included in HTML output.
           Each directive line must fit in one line and it cannot be broken to separate lines.

               #T2HTML-TITLE            &lt;as passed option --title&gt;
               #T2HTML-EMAIL            &lt;as passed option --email&gt;
               #T2HTML-AUTHOR           &lt;as passed option --author&gt;
               #T2HTML-DOC              &lt;as passed option --doc&gt;
               #T2HTML-METAKEYWORDS     &lt;as passed option --meta-keywords&gt;
               #T2HTML-METADESCRIPTION  &lt;as passed option --meta-description&gt;

           You can pass command line options embedded in the file. Like if you wanted the CODE  section  (column
           12) to be coloured with shade of gray, you could add:

               #T2HTML-OPTION  --css-code-bg

           Or  you  could  request  turning  on particular options. Notice that each line is exactly as you have
           passed the argument in command  line.  Imagine  surrounding  double  quoted  around  lines  that  are
           arguments to the associated options.

               #T2HTML-OPTION  --as-is
               #T2HTML-OPTION  --quiet
               #T2HTML-OPTION  --language
               #T2HTML-OPTION  en
               #T2HTML-OPTION  --css-font-type
               #T2HTML-OPTION  Trebuchet MS
               #T2HTML-OPTION --css-code-bg
               #T2HTML-OPTION --css-code-note
               #T2HTML-OPTION (?:Note|Notice|Warning):

           You can also embed your own comments to the text. These are stripped away:

               #T2HTML-COMMENT  You comment here
               #T2HTML-COMMENT  You another comment here

       Embedding files
           #INCLUDE- command

           This  is  used  to  include  the  content  into  current  current position. The URL can be a filename
           reference, where every $VAR is substituted from the environment variables. The tilde(~) expansion  is
           not supported. The included filename is operating system supported path location.

           A prefix "raw:" disables any normal formatting. The file content is included as is.

           The URL can also be a HTTP reference to a remote location, whose content is included at the point. In
           case of remote content or when filename ends to extension ".html" or ".html", the content is stripped
           in  order  to make the inclusion of the content possible. In picture below, only the lines within the
           BODY, marked with !!, are included:

               &lt;html&gt;
                 &lt;head&gt;
                   ...
                 &lt;/head&gt;
                 &lt;body&gt;
                   this text                 !!
                   and more of this          !!
                 &lt;/body&gt;
               &lt;/html&gt;

           Examples:

               #INCLUDE-$HOME/lib/html/picture1.html
               #INCLUDE-<a href="http://www.example.com/code.html">http://www.example.com/code.html</a>
               #INCLUDE-raw:example/code.html

       Embedding pictures
           #PIC command is used to include pictures into the text

               #PIC picture.png#Caption Text#Picture HTML attributes#align#
                     (1)        (2)          (3)                     (4)

               1.  The NAME or URL address of the picture. Like image/this.png

               2.  The Text that appears below picture

               3.  Additional attributes that are attached inside &lt;img&gt; tag.
                   For &lt;img width="200" height="200"&gt;, the line would
                   read:

                   #PIC some.png#Caption Text#width=200 length=200##

               4.  The position of image: "left" (default), "center", "right"

           Note: The "Caption Text" will also become the ALT text of the image which is used in case the browser
           is not capable of showing pictures.  You can suppress the ALT text with option <b>--no-picture-alt</b>.

       Fragment identifiers for named tags
           #REF command is used for referring to HTML &lt;name&gt; tag inside current document. The whole command must
           be placed on one single line and cannot be broken to multiple lines. An example:

               #REF #how_to_profile;(Note: profiling);
                     (1)            (2)

               1.  The NAME HTML tag reference in current document, a single word.
                   This can also be a full URL link.
                   You can get NAME list by enabling --toc-url-print option.

               2.  The clickable text is delimited by ; characters.

       Referring to external documents.
           "#URL" tag can be used to embed URLs inline, so that the full link is not  visible.  Only  the  shown
           text is used to jump to URL.  This directive cannot be broken to separate lines,

                #URL&lt;FULL-URL&gt;&lt;embedded inline text&gt;
                    |          |
                    |          Displayed, clickable, text
                    Must be kept together

           An example:

                See search engine #URL&lt;<a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a>&gt;&lt;Google&gt;

</pre><h4><b>TABLE</b> <b>OF</b> <b>CONTENT</b> <b>HEADING</b></h4><pre>
       If  there  is heading 1, which is named exactly "Table of Contents", then all text up to next heading are
       discarded from the generated HTML file. This is done  because  program  generates  its  own  TOC.  It  is
       supposed  that  you  use some text formatting program to generate the toc for you in .txt file and you do
       not maintain it manually. For example Emacs package <u>tinytf.el</u> can be used.

</pre><h4><b>TROUBLESHOOTING</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Generated</b> <b>HTML</b> <b>document</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>intended</b>
       Did you use editor that inseted TABs which inserts single  ascii  code  (\t)  and  8  spaces?  check  our
       editor's settings and prefer writing in-all-space format.

       The  most  common  mistake is that there are extra newlines in the document. Keeep <u>one</u> empty line between
       headings and text, keep <u>one</u> empty line between paragraphs, keep <u>one</u> empty  line  between  body  text  and
       bullet. Make it your mantra: <u>one</u> <u>one</u> <u>one</u> ...

       Next, you may have put text at wrong column position. Remember that the regular text is at column 8.

       If  generated  HTML  suddendly  starts  using  only one font, eg &lt;pre&gt;, then you have forgot to close the
       block. Make it read even, like this:

           Code block
               Code block
               Code block
           ;;  Add empty comment here to "close" the code example at column 12

       Headings start with a big letter or number, likein "Heading", not "heading". Double check the spelling.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To print the test page and demonstrate possibilities:

           t2html --test-page

       To make simple HTML page without any meta information:

           t2html --title "Html Page Title" --author "Mr. Foo" \
                  --simple --out --print file.txt

       If you have periodic post in email format, use <b>--delete-email-headers</b> to ignore the header text:

           t2html --out --print --delete-email-headers page.txt

       To make page fast

           t2html --out --print page.txt

       To convert page from a text document, including meta tags, buttons, colors and frames. Pay  attention  to
       switch <u>--html-body</u> which defines document language.

           t2html                                              \
           --print                                             \
           --out                                               \
           --author    "Mr. foo"                               \
           --email     "<a href="mailto:foo@example.com">foo@example.com</a>"                       \
           --title     "This is manual page of page BAR"       \
           --html-body LANG=en                                 \
           --button-prev  previous.html                        \
           --button-top   index.html                           \
           --buttion-next next.html                            \
           --document  <a href="http://example.com/dir/this-page.html">http://example.com/dir/this-page.html</a>   \
           --url       manual.html                             \
           --css-code-bg                                       \

           --meta-keywords    "language-en,manual,program"     \
           --meta-description "Bar program to do this that and more of those" \
           manual.txt

       To check links and print status of all links in par with the http error message (most verbose):

           t2html --link-check file.txt | tee link-error.log

       To print only problematic links:

           t2html --link-check --quiet file.txt | tee link-error.log

       To print terse output in egep -n like manner: line number, link and error code:

           t2html --link-check-single --quiet file.txt | tee link-error.log

       To  check  links  from multiple pages and cache good links to separate file, use <b>--link-cache</b> option. The
       next link check will run much faster because cached valid links will not be  fetched  again.  At  regular
       intervals delete the link cache file to force complete check.

           t2html --link-check-single \
                  --link-cache $HOME/tmp/link.cache \
                  --quiet file.txt

       To split large document into pieces, and convert each piece to HTML:

           t2html --split1 --split-name file.txt | t2html --simple --out

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>EMAIL</b>
           If  environment  variable  <u>EMAIL</u> is defined, it is used in footer for contact address. Option <b>--email</b>
           overrides environment setting.

       <b>LANG</b>
           The default language setting for switch "--language" Make sure the first two characters contains  the
           language definition, like in: LANG=en.iso88591

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  implementation was originally designed to work linewise, so it is unfortunately impossible to add or
       modify any existing feature to look for items that span more than one line.

       As the options <b>--xhtml</b> was much later added, it may not produce completely syntactically valid markup.

</pre><h4><b>SCRIPT</b> <b>CATEGORIES</b></h4><pre>
       CPAN/Administrative html

</pre><h4><b>PREREQUISITES</b></h4><pre>
       No additional Perl CPAN modules needed for text to HTML conversion.

</pre><h4><b>COREQUISITES</b></h4><pre>
       If link check feature is used to to validate URL links, then following modules are needed from Perl  CPAN
       "use LWP::UserAgent" "HTML::FormatText" and "HTML::Parse"

       If  you  module  "HTML::LinkExtractor"  is  available,  it  is  used  instead of included link extracting
       algorithm.
