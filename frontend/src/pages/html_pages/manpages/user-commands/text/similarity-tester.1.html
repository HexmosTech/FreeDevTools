</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Sim_c</u>  reads  the  C  files  <u>file</u>  <u>...</u>   and looks for segments of text that are similar; two segments of
       program text are similar if they only differ  in  layout,  comment,  identifiers,  and  the  contents  of
       numbers,  strings  and  characters.   If  any  runs  of sufficient length are found, they are reported on
       standard output; the number of significant tokens in the run is given between square brackets.

       <u>Sim_c++</u> does the same for C++, <u>sim_java</u> for Java, <u>sim_pasc</u> for Pascal, <u>sim_m2</u> for Modula-2, <u>sim_mira</u>  for
       Miranda,  <u>sim_lisp</u>  for Lisp, and <u>sim_8086</u> for 8086 assembler code.  <u>Sim_text</u> works on arbitrary text and
       it is occasionally useful on shell scripts.

       The program can be used for finding copied pieces of code in purportedly unrelated programs (with  <b>-s</b>  or
       <b>-S</b>), or for finding accidentally duplicated code in larger projects (with <b>-f</b> or <b>-F</b>).

       If  a separator <b>/</b> or <b>|</b> is present in the list of input files, the files are divided into a group of "new"
       files (before the <b>/</b> or <b>|</b>) and a group of "old" files; if there is no <b>/</b> or <b>|</b>, all files  are  "new".   Old
       files are never compared to other files.  See also the description of the <b>-s</b> and <b>-S</b> options below.

       Since  the  similarity tester needs file names to pinpoint the similarities, it cannot read from standard
       input.

       The similarity tester takes ASCII or UTF-8 text as input, and produces a sorted list of runs in text form
       (default or with the <b>-d</b> or <b>-n</b> options) or in percentage form  (with  the  <b>-p</b>  option).   Input  in  other
       formats,  e.g.   <u>.pdf</u>  or  <u>.doc</u>  needs  to  be  converted to ASCII or UTF-8 by preprocessing.  Aggregated
       similarity results can be obtained by doing postprocessing on one of the forms of output.

       There are the following options:

       <b>-a</b>     All new files are compared to all files.  See the section `Calculating Percentages' below.

       <b>-d</b>     The output is in a <a href="../man1/diff.1.html">diff</a>(1)-like format instead of the default 2-column  format.   Recommended  for
              text in languages with non-Latin alphabets.

       <b>-e</b>     Each file is compared to each file in isolation. This will find all similarities between all texts
              involved,  regardless  of  repetitive  text, but may be slow for large numbers of files.  See also
              `Calculating Percentages' below.

       <b>-f</b>     Runs are restricted to segments with balancing parentheses, to isolate  potential  routine  bodies
              (not in <u>sim_text</u>).

       <b>-F</b>     The names of routines in calls are required to match exactly (not in <u>sim_text</u>).

       <b>-i</b>     The names of the files to be compared are read from standard input, including a possible separator
              <b>/</b>  or  <b>|</b>;  the  file  names must be one to a line.  This option allows a very large number of file
              names to be specified; it differs from the @ facility  provided  by  some  compilers  in  that  it
              handles file names only, and does not recognize option arguments.

       <b>-M</b>     Memory usage information is displayed on standard error output.

       <b>-n</b>     Similarities found are summarized by file name, position and size, rather than displayed in full.

       <b>-o</b> <b>F</b>   The output is written to the file named <u>F</u>.

       <b>-O</b>     The option settings used are shown at the beginning of the output.

       <b>-p</b>     The output is given in similarity percentages; see `Calculating Percentages' below; implies <b>-s</b>.

       <b>-P</b>     When reporting percentages, only the main contributor for each file is shown.

       <b>-r</b> <b>N</b>   The  minimum  run length is set to <u>N</u> units; the default is 24 tokens, except in <u>sim_text</u>, where it
              is 8 words.

       <b>-R</b>     Directories in the input list are entered recursively, and all files they contain are involved  in
              the comparison.

       <b>-s</b>     The contents of a file are not compared to itself (-s for "not self").

       <b>-S</b>     The contents of the new files are compared to the old files only - not between themselves.

       <b>-t</b> <b>N</b>   In  combination with the <b>-p</b> option, sets the threshold (in percents) below which similarities will
              not be reported; the default is 1, except in <u>sim_text</u>, where it is 20.

       <b>-T</b>     Suppresses the printing of information about the input files.

       <b>-u</b>     The output is not buffered and not sorted (only when reporting percentages).

       <b>-v</b>     Prints the version number and compilation date on standard output, then stops.

       <b>-w</b> <b>N</b>   The page width used is set to <u>N</u> columns; the default is 80.

       <b>--</b>     (A secret option, which prints the input as the similarity checker sees it, and then stops.)

       The <b>-p</b> option results in lines of the form
               F consists for x % of G material
       meaning that x % of F's text can also be found in G.  Note that this relation is  not  symmetric;  it  is
       quite possible for one file to consist for 100 % of text from another file, while the other file consists
       for  only 1 % of text of the first file, if their lengths differ enough.  The <b>-P</b> (capital P) option shows
       the main contributor for each file only.  This simplifies the identification of a set of files  A[1]  ...
       A[n],  where  the  concatenation  of  these  files  is also present.  A threshold can be set using the <b>-t</b>
       option.  Note that the granularity of the recognized text is still governed  by  the  <b>-r</b>  option  or  its
       default.

       The  <b>-r</b>  option  controls  the  number  of  "units" that constitute a run.  For the programs that compare
       programming language code, a unit is a lexical token in the  pertinent  language;  comment  and  standard
       preamble material (file inclusion, etc.) is ignored and all strings are considered equal.  For <u>sim_text</u> a
       unit  is a "word" which is defined as any sequence of one or more letters, digits, or characters over 127
       (177 octal), to accommodate full Unicode (UTF-8).

       The programs can handle Unicode (UTF-16) file names under Windows.

       <u>Sim_text</u> accepts  s p a c e d   t e x t  as normal text.

       Once <u>sim</u> has read, stored and preprocessed the input, it will no longer run out of memory.  If memory  is
       short it will change automatically to unbuffered, unsorted output (while issuing a warning message).

</pre><h4><b>HOW</b> <b>SIMILARITY</b> <b>IS</b> <b>RECOGNIZED</b></h4><pre>
       Since  computers cannot test for similarity, only for equality, all units in the input files are replaced
       by 16-bit tokens, such that all units that are regarded as similar are reduced to the  same  token.   For
       example  in <u>sim_c</u> all identifiers are replaced by the token IDF and all strings are replaced by the token
       STR. The secret option <b>--</b> can be used to see the resulting token sequence.

       In <u>sim_text</u> each word is reduced to a 16-bit token using a hash function. There is a chance of 1 :  65536
       that  two  different  words  get  the same token value, but because recognized runs of tokens are usually
       several tokens long, the chances for accidental similarities are very low.

       The sequence of tokens obtained this way is then processed as follows.

       The default operation cycle of <u>sim</u> starts at the beginning of the token sequence of the first input  file
       or  at  a  position $X$ in file $F$ at which the previous cycle has left off.  <u>Sim</u> then finds the longest
       segment $S$ such that 1) $S$ is equal to the segment starting  at  $X$;  2)  $S$  is  situated  somewhere
       between  position  $X$ in $F$ and the end of all files; 3) $S$ does not overlap with the segment starting
       at $X$.  If the segment is at least of minimum run size, it is recorded, and the cycle starts again  just
       after the segment at $X$; otherwise it starts again at $X+1$ .

       So  if  the  token sequence at $X$ reads abcabcadefabdabcz, the cycle finds $S$ to be the abc just before
       the end; abca at $X+3$ would be longer but overlaps with the abca at $X+0$ .  The cycle  then  starts  at
       $X+3$, and will find another match with the abc near the end.  Finally the ab after the f will be matched
       with the ab just before the cz.  So the following matches are found:

       $ X[0:2] = X[13:15] =$ abc
       $ X[3:5] = X[13:15] =$ abc
       $ X[9:10] = X[13:14] =$ ab

       This  way  best matches for the text in a file are found in material to the right of it, until the end of
       all files.  The results are asymmetric: given files <u>F1</u>, <u>F2</u>, <u>F3</u>, <u>F4</u>, no matches for <u>F3</u> are  reported  from
       <u>F1</u>  or  <u>F2</u>,  for  example.   As  explained  below  under  "Limitations", this avoids duplicate reports of
       similarity and helps to keep <u>sim</u> fast.

</pre><h4><b>WHAT</b> <b>IS</b> <b>COMPARED</b> <b>TO</b> <b>WHAT</b></h4><pre>
       The area that is searched by <u>sim's</u> cycle is called the <u>range</u>.  The default range, which as we  have  seen
       above runs from the file under observation to the end of all files, is excellent for finding similarities
       in  program  files,  and, when doing percentages, for getting an impression of which files are related to
       which files, but sometimes more control  is  needed.   The  following  modifications  to  the  range  are
       available:

       The  <b>-a</b>  option  includes  <u>all</u>  text  in the range by not stopping the search at the end of the files but
       rather looping back to the beginning of the files and continuing to the point where the  search  started.
       Now matches are also found in files before the present one and the results are symmetric: given files <u>F1</u>,
       <u>F2</u>,  <u>F3</u>, <u>F4</u>, matches for <u>F3</u> will also be reported from <u>F1</u> or <u>F2</u>, if present.  But matches may be reported
       twice, once for file <u>Fa</u> versus file <u>Fb</u>, and once for file <u>Fb</u> versus file <u>Fa</u>.  The <b>-a</b> option allows a more
       accurate determination of similarity percentages.

       The <b>-a</b> option is the only way to obtain symmetrical results, with information about both <u>F1</u> vs. <u>F2</u> and <u>F2</u>
       vs. <u>F1</u>.

       The <b>-S</b> option removes the new files from the range, so files are only compared to the old files.

       The <b>-s</b> option removes the file itself from the range, so a file will not be compared to itself.  This  is
       the default when reporting percentages.

       In  normal operation the whole range is searched as one unit. The <b>-e</b> option divides up the range into the
       separate files, and causes <u>sim</u> to compare a file to each of the other files  separately.   This  produces
       the  most  detailed  information  when  reporting  text  similarities, and the best possible results when
       reporting similarity percentages, but can be quite slow.

   <b>A</b> <b>Tabular</b> <b>Representation</b>
       Input files are divided into two groups, new and old.  In the absence of control options <u>sim</u> compares the
       files thus (for 4 new files and 6 old ones):
                                 n e w    /     o l d       &lt;- second file
                               1  2  3  4 / 5  6  7  8  9 10
                             |------------/------------
                        n  1 | c  c  c  c / c  c  c  c  c  c
                        e  2 |    c  c  c / c  c  c  c  c  c
                        w  3 |       c  c / c  c  c  c  c  c
                           4 |          c / c  c  c  c  c  c
              first        / / /  /  /  / / /  /  /  /  /  /
              file  -&gt;     5 |            /
                        o  6 |            /
                        l  7 |            /
                        d  8 |            /
                           9 |            /
                          10 |            /
       where a c indicates that the first file is compared to  the  second  file,  and  the  /   represents  the
       demarcation between new and old files.  The comparison range of the first files is clearly visible.

       Using the <b>-a</b> option extends this to
                                 n e w    /     o l d       &lt;- second file
                               1  2  3  4 / 5  6  7  8  9 10
                             |------------/------------
                        n  1 | c  c  c  c / c  c  c  c  c  c
                        e  2 | c  c  c  c / c  c  c  c  c  c
                        w  3 | c  c  c  c / c  c  c  c  c  c
                           4 | c  c  c  c / c  c  c  c  c  c
              first        / / /  /  /  / / /  /  /  /  /  /
              file  -&gt;     5 |            /
                        o  6 |            /
                        l  7 |            /
                        d  8 |            /
                           9 |            /
                          10 |            /

       Using the <b>-S</b> option instead reduces this to
                                 n e w    /     o l d       &lt;- second file
                               1  2  3  4 / 5  6  7  8  9 10
                             |------------/------------
                        n  1 |            / c  c  c  c  c  c
                        e  2 |            / c  c  c  c  c  c
                        w  3 |            / c  c  c  c  c  c
                           4 |            / c  c  c  c  c  c
              first        / / /  /  /  / / /  /  /  /  /  /
              file  -&gt;     5 |            /
                        o  6 |            /
                        l  7 |            /
                        d  8 |            /
                           9 |            /
                          10 |            /

       Finally, using the <b>-s</b> option changes the default ranges to
                                 n e w    /     o l d       &lt;- second file
                               1  2  3  4 / 5  6  7  8  9 10
                             |------------/------------
                        n  1 |    c  c  c / c  c  c  c  c  c
                        e  2 |       c  c / c  c  c  c  c  c
                        w  3 |          c / c  c  c  c  c  c

                        l  7 |            /
                        d  8 |            /
                           9 |            /
                          10 |            /
       and the <b>-a</b>-extended ranges to
                                 n e w    /     o l d       &lt;- second file

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Repetitive  input is the bane of similarity checking.  If we have a file containing 4 copies of identical
       text,
           A1 A2 A3 A4
       where the numbers serve only to distinguish the identical copies, there are 7 non-overlapping identities:
       A1=A2, A1=A3, A1=A4, A2=A3, A2=A4, A3=A4, and A1A2=A3A4.  Of these, only 3 are meaningful: A1=A2,  A2=A3,
       and  A3=A4.   And for a table with 20 lines identical to each other, not unusual in a program text, there
       are 715 non-overlapping identities, of which at most 19 are meaningful.  Reporting all  715  of  them  is
       clearly unacceptable.

       This  is  remedied  by <u>sim's</u> search cycle: for each position in the text, the largest segment is found of
       which a non-overlapping copy occurs in the text following  it.   That  segment  and  its  copy  are  then
       reported and scanning resumes at the position just after the segment.  For the above example this results
       in  the  two  identities  A1A2=A3A4  and A3=A4, which is quite satisfactory, and for <u>N</u> identical segments
       roughly <u>2</u> <u>log</u> <u>N</u> messages are given.

       This also works out well when the four identical segments are in different files:
           File1: A1
           File2: A2
           File3: A3
           File4: A4
       Now combined segments like A1A2 do not occur, and the algorithm finds the runs A1=A2, A2=A3,  and  A3=A4,
       for a total of <u>N-1</u> runs, all informative.

   <b>Calculating</b> <b>Percentages</b>
       The above approach is unsuitable for obtaining the exact percentage of a file's content that can be found
       in  another  file,  although  indicative  results  can be obtained.  Obtaining exact percentages requires
       comparing each file pair in isolation; this is what the <b>-ae</b> options do.  Under the <b>-ae</b> options a  segment
       File3:A3,  recognized  in  File4,  will  again be recognized in File1 and File2.  In the example above it
       produces the runs
           File1:A1=File2:A2
           File1:A1=File3:A3
           File1:A1=File4:A4
           File2:A2=File3:A3
           File2:A2=File4:A4
           File2:A2=File1:A1
           File3:A3=File4:A4
           File3:A3=File1:A1
           File3:A3=File2:A2
           File4:A4=File1:A1
           File4:A4=File2:A2
           File4:A4=File3:A3
       for a total of <u>N(N-1)</u> runs.

       When the <b>-e</b> option is used alone.  <u>sim</u> will find the following runs:
           File1:A1=File2:A2
           File1:A1=File3:A3
           File1:A1=File4:A4
           File2:A2=File3:A3
           File2:A2=File4:A4
           File3:A3=File4:A4
       for a total of <u>½N(N-1)</u> runs, thus missing half the percentage contributions; in fact, File4 is  found  to
       have 0% in common with the other files.

       If, however, the <b>-a</b> option is used alone.  <u>sim</u> finds the following runs:
           File1:A1=File2:A2
           File2:A2=File3:A3
           File3:A3=File4:A4
           File4:A4=File1:A1
       for  a total of <u>N</u> runs. This setting misses many of the percentage contributions, but finds something for
       every file.

</pre><h4><b>TIME</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SPACE</b> <b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Care has been taken to keep the time requirements of  all  internal  processes  (almost)  linear  in  the
       lengths of the input files, by using various tables.

       The time requirements are quadratic in the number of files.  This means that, for example, one 64 MB file
       processes much faster than 8000 8 kB files.

       The  program  requires 6 bytes of memory for each token in the input; 2 bytes per newline (not when doing
       percentages); and 80 bytes for each run found.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The call
               sim_c *.c
       highlights duplicate C code in the directory.  (It is useful to remove generated files first.)  A call of
               sim_c -f -F *.c
       can pinpoint the duplicate code further.

       A call
               sim_text -peu -S new/* "|" old/*
       compares each file in new/* to each file in old/*, and if any pair has more that 20% in common, that fact
       is reported.  Usually a similarity of 30% or more is significant; lower than 20% is probably coincidence;
       and in between is doubtful.

       The u in -peu causes the output to be unbuffered (and unsorted), so if the program is stopped for running
       out of time, any results already found are not lost.

       For large data sets, using -pu rather than -peu may do the job much more quickly, but less accurately.

       The | can be used as a separator instead of / on systems where the / as  a  command-line  parameter  gets
       mangled by the command interpreter.

       These calls are good for plagiarism detection.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Unbuffered, unsorted output is not available for text output, only for percentage output.
