</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gprofng-display-text - Display the performance data in plain text format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gprofng</b> <b>display</b> <b>text</b> [<u>option(s)</u>] [<u>commands</u>] [-script <u>script-file</u>] <u>experiment(s)</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Print a plain text version of the various displays supported by gprofng.

       The input consists of one or more experiment directories.  Through commands, the user controls the
       output.

       There is a rich set of commands to control the display of the data.  The <b>NOTES</b> section lists the most
       common ones.  The gprofng user guide lists all the commands supported.

       Commands specified on the command line need to be prepended with the dash ('-') symbol.

       In this example, a function overview will be shown, followed by the source code listing of function
       <b>my-func</b>, annotated with the performance metrics that have been recorded during the data collection and
       stored in experiment directory <b>my-exp.er</b>:

               $ gprofng display text -functions -source my-func my-exp.er

       Instead of, or in addition to, specifying these commands on the command line, commands may also be
       included in a file called the <u>script-file</u>.

       Note that the commands are processed and interpreted from left to right, <u>so</u> <u>the</u> <u>order</u> <u>matters</u>.

       If this tool is invoked without options, commands, or a script file, it starts in interpreter mode.  The
       user can then issue the commands interactively.  The session is terminated with the <b>exit</b> command in the
       interpreter.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--version</b>
           Print the version number and exit.

       <b>--help</b>
           Print usage information and exit.

       <b>-script</b> <u>script-file</u>
           Execute the commands stored in the script file.  This feature may be combined with commands specified
           at the command line.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Many commands are supported.  Below, the more common ones are listed in mostly alphabetical order,
       because sometimes it is more logical to swap the order of two entries.

       There are many more commands.  These are documented in the user guide.

       "callers-callees"
           In a callers-callees panel, it is shown which function(s) call the target function (the <u>callers</u>) and
           what functions it is calling (the <u>callees</u>).  This command prints the callers-callees panel for each
           of the functions, in the order specified by the function sort metric.

       "calltree"
           Display the dynamic call graph from the experiment, showing the hierarchical metrics at each level.

       "compare {on | off | delta | ratio}"
           By default, the results for multiple experiments are aggregated.  This command changes this to enable
           the comparison of experiments for certain views (e.g. the function view).  The first experiment
           specified is defined to be the reference.  The following options are supported:

           "on"
               For each experiment specified on the command line, print the values for the metrics that have
               been activated for the experiment.

           "off"
               Disable the comparison of experiments.  This is the default.

           "delta"
               Print the values for the reference experiment.  The results for the other experiments are shown
               as a delta relative to the reference (current-reference).

           "ratio"
               Print the values for the reference experiment.  The results for the other experiments are shown
               as a ratio relative to the reference (current/reference).

       "disasm <u>function-name</u>"
           List the source code and instructions for the function specified.  The instructions are annotated
           with the metrics used.

       "fsingle <u>function-name</u> [<b>n</b>]"
           Write a summary panel for the specified function.  The optional parameter <u>n</u> is needed for those cases
           where several functions have the same name.

       "fsummary"
           Write a summary panel for each function in the function list.

       "functions"
           Display a list of all functions executed.  For each function the used metrics (e.g. the CPU time) are
           shown.

       "header"
           Shows several operational characteristics of the experiment(s) specified on the command line.

       "limit <u>n</u>"
           Limit the output to <u>n</u> lines.

       "lines"
           Write a list of source lines and their metrics, ordered by the current sort metric.

       "metric_list"
           Display the currently selected metrics in the function view and a list of all the metrics available
           for the target experiment(s).

       "metrics <u>metric-spec</u>"
           Define the metrics to be displayed in the function and callers-callees overviews.

           The <u>metric-spec</u> can either be the keyword <b>default</b> to restore the default metrics selection, or a
           colon separated list with metrics.

           A special metric is "hwc".  It automatically expands to the active set of hardware event counters
           used in the experiment(s).

           If both instructions and clock cycles have been measured, the "CPI" and "IPC" metrics can be used to
           see the Clockcycles Per Instruction and Instructions Per Clockcyle values, respectively.

           The gprofng user guide has more details how to define metrics.

       "name {short | long | mangled}[:{soname | nosoname}]"
           Specify whether to use the short, long, or mangled form of function names.  Optionally, the load
           object that the function is part of can be included in the output by adding the <u>soname</u> keyword.  It
           can also be ommitted (<u>nosoname</u>), which is the default.

           Whether there is an actual difference between these types of names depends on the language.

           Note that there should be no (white)space to the left and right of the colon (<b>:</b>).

           This option should not be confused with the keyword <b>name</b> in a metric definition, which is used to
           specify that the names of functions should be shown in the function overview.

       "overview"
           Shows a summary of the recorded performance data for the experiment(s) specified on the command line.

       "pcs"
           Write a list of program counters (PCs) and their metrics, ordered by the current sort metric.

       "sort <u>metric-spec</u>"
           Sort the function list on the <u>metric-spec</u> given.

           @IndexSubentry{Sort, Reverse order} The data can be sorted in reverse order by prepending the metric
           definition with a minus (<b>-</b>) sign.

           For example <b>sort</b> <b>-e.totalcpu</b>.

           @IndexSubentry{Sort, Reset to default} A default metric for the sort operation has been defined and
           since this is a persistent command, this default can be restored with "default" as the key (<b>sort</b>
           <b>default</b>).

       "source <u>function-name</u>"
           List the source code for the function specified, annotated with the metrics used.

       "viewmode {user | expert | machine}"
           This command is only relevant for Java programs.  For all other languages supported, the viewmode
           setting has no effect.

           The following options are supported:

           "user"
               Show the Java call stacks for Java threads, but do not show housekeeping threads.  The function
               view includes a function called <b>&lt;JVM-System&gt;</b>.  This represents the aggregated time from non-Java
               threads.  In case the JVM software does not report a Java call stack, time is reported against
               the function <b>&lt;no</b> <b>Java</b> <b>callstack</b> <b>recorded&gt;</b>.

           "expert"
               Show the Java call stacks for Java threads when the user Java code is executed, and machine call
               stacks when JVM code is executed, or when the JVM software does not report a Java call stack.
               Show the machine call stacks for housekeeping threads.

           "machine"
               Show the actual native call stacks for all threads.  This is the view mode for C, C++, and
               Fortran.
