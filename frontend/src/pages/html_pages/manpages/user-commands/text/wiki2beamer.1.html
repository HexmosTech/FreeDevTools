</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       wiki2beamer - convert wiki-formatted text to latex-beamer code

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       wiki2beamer [OPTION...] [FILE...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>FILE</u>
           the text-file(s) to be processed

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
           show a short usage help

       <b>--version</b>
           show version information

       <b>-o,--output</b>  <u>FILE</u>
           write output to FILE instead of stdout

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Usually you want to pipe the output of wiki2beamer into a file:

       wiki2beamer footalk.txt &gt; footalk.tex

       If called with multiple input files, wiki2beamer processes them in order with their content being simply
       concatenated. If called without any input file, wiki2beamer will attempt to read input from STDIN. If no
       input files are supplied and nothing is available on STDIN, wiki2beamer prints its usage message and
       exits.

       If an error occurs, wiki2beamer returns a return code other then 0.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       Wiki2beamer has it’s own wiki-syntax which (evolved without much of a concept ;) and) is described below.
       Everything that is unknown to wiki2beamer will be passed through to the LaTeX output (unless inside
       special environments).

   <b>Overall</b> <b>Structure</b>
       A wiki2beamer txt file can consist of two sections: the head and the body. The head is optional and is an
       autotemplate environment. The body contains the content of the document. If the head (autotemplate) is
       not given, then only the code for the body will be generated and can be included into a manually crafted
       LaTeX template file.

   <b>Managing</b> <b>Input</b>
       You can split input to wiki2beamer into multiple files. This helps to keep things apart and avoids
       conflicts. There are two ways to split input. The first is to use multiple input files which wiki2beamer
       will read and process in order as if they were one concatenated file. The second is to use the
       &gt;&gt;&gt;include&lt;&lt;&lt; syntax.

       &gt;&gt;&gt;includefile&lt;&lt;&lt;
           Include the file named <u>includefile</u> at this line. Works recursively. Endless recursion will be
           detected and treated as an error. Including files doesn’t work inside [nowiki] and [code]
           environments (see below).

   <b>Structuring</b> <b>the</b> <b>Presentation</b>
       == <u>sectionname</u> ==
           opens a section called <u>sectionname</u>

       == <u>longsectionname</u> ==[<u>shortname</u>]
           opens a section called <u>longsectionname</u>, passing the parameter <u>shortname</u> to latex

       === <u>subsectname</u> ===
           opens a subsection called <u>subsectname</u>

       === <u>longsubsectname</u> ===[<u>shortname</u>]
           opens a subsection called <u>longsubsectname</u>, passing the parameter <u>shortname</u> to latex

       ==== <u>frametitle</u> ====_
           opens a frame with the title <u>frametitle</u>

       ==== <u>frametitle</u> ====[<u>param</u>]
           opens a frame with the title <u>frametitle</u>, passes frame <u>parameters</u> like t, fragile, verbatim etc. to
           latex

       !==== <u>frametitle</u> ====[<u>param</u>]
           the ! added in front of a frame, selects a frame for exclusive generation. It makes wiki2beamer skip
           all frames that are not selected. You can select multiple frames. This can speed up the
           edit-compile-view cycle massively.

       Sectioning commands work only at the beginning of a line.

   <b>Lists</b> <b>(Bullets/Enumerations)</b>
       * <u>text</u>
           create a bullet (itemize) with <u>text</u>

       *&lt;onslide&gt; <u>text</u>
           create a bullet (itemize) with <u>text</u> that only appears on the specified slides (<u>onslide</u>)

       # <u>text</u>
           create a numbered item (enumerate) with <u>text</u>

       #&lt;onslide&gt; <u>text</u>
           create a numbered item (enumerate) with <u>text</u> that only appears on the specified slides (<u>onslide</u>)

       Cascaded lists, mixed ordered and unordered items:

            * This is a crazy list.
            *# It contains different items.
            *# In different formats.
            *** On different levels.
            ***&lt;2-&gt; which are animated
            *&lt;3-&gt; Quite a lot of fun.
            **&lt;4-&gt; Isn't it?

   <b>Environments</b>
       LaTeX knows many environments, some of which are as simple as \begin{center} \end{center}, others are
       more complicated. To use these in a more wiki-like fashion, use &lt;[name] to open and [name]&gt; to close
       environments. It will be simply converted to \begin{name} and end{name}.

       <b>Warning</b>

       No parsing is done. The user is responsible for closing any opened environment. Environment-tags are only
       recognized at the beginning of a line.

   <b>Special</b> <b>Environments</b>
       Unlike standard environments, some environment names are recognized by wiki2beamer. These are: nowiki,
       code, autotemplate and frame. If wiki2beamer detects one of these it will do some advanced parsing, which
       can even fail with a syntax error.

   <b>Autotemplate</b>
       Autotemplate can be used at the beginning of a beamer .txt file. It will create the required LaTeX
       headers to compile the content.

       &lt;[autotemplate]
           opens the autotemplate environment

       [autotemplate]&gt;
           close the autotemplate environment

       <u>key=value</u> (inside [autotemplate])_
           insert a template command <u>\keyvalue</u>

       key=value pairs are converted to \keyvalue in the output (except special keys) — everything after = is
       just appended to \key.

           &lt;[autotemplate]
           usepackage=[utf8]{inputenc}
           [autotemplate]&gt;

       will be converted to \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}.

       There is a built-in set of options:

           &lt;[autotemplate]
           documentclass={beamer}
           usepackage={listings}
           usepackage={wasysym}
           usepackage={graphicx}
           date={\today}
           lstdefinestyle={basic}{....}
           titleframe=True
           [autotemplate]&gt;

       titleframe is a special key that tells wiki2beamer to create a title frame. To set the title, subtitle
       and author of the presentation use the keys title, subtitle and author. Overriding of the default options
       works on:

       •   per-key level for: documentclass, titleframe

       •   per-package level for: usepackage

       •   no overriding for: everything else

   <b>Code</b>
       Use code-environments to display animated code listings.

       &lt;[code]
           open a code environment

       &lt;[code][<u>param</u>]
           open a code environment passing <u>parameters</u> to the latex lstlisting environment.

       [code]&gt;
           close the code environment

               &lt;[code][key=value,...]
               ...
               [code]&gt;

       &lt;[code] opens the environment, [code]&gt; closes it, everything after &lt;[code] is passed to the LaTeX
       listings package as options for this listing. Inside the code environment, [ and ] must be escaped as \[
       and \]. Things between [ and ] are animations. There are two kinds of animations:

       •   [&lt;slidespec&gt;some code] - show "some code" only on specified slides

       •   [[&lt;slidespec&gt;some code][&lt;slidespec&gt;some other code]] - show "some code" on the slides in the first
           spec, show "some other code" on the slides in the second spec, fill up space on slides without
           content with spaces

       Slide-specs can be of the form:

       •   n - one single frame n

       •   n-m - sequence of frames n to m

       •   spec,spec,... - combine multiple specs into on (e.g. &lt;1-3,5&gt;)

   <b>Nowiki</b>
       Nowiki-Environments completely escape from wiki2beamer replacements. &lt;[nowiki] opens the environment,
       [nowiki]&gt; closes it.

   <b>Frame</b>
       The LaTeX-frame environment is where the content of a slide goes. You can manually close a
       frame-environment which was opened with ==== Frametitle ==== with [frame]&gt;. Wiki2beamer is then aware
       that the last frame is already closed and doesn’t try to close it again.

   <b>Text</b> <b>Formatting</b>
       '''<u>text</u>'''
           typeset <u>text</u> bold

       ''<u>text</u>''
           typeset <u>text</u> italic

       @<u>text</u>@
           typeset <u>text</u> in typewriter type, to ignore an @, escape it as \@

       !<u>text</u>!
           alert <u>text</u>, to ignore an !, escape it as \!

       _ color _ <u>text</u> _
           make <u>text</u> appear in color

   <b>Columns</b>
       &lt;[columns]
           opens the column environment

       [[[ <u>width</u> ]]]
           creates a column of <u>width</u>, everything below goes into this column

       [columns]&gt;
           closes the column environment

   <b>Graphics</b>
       &lt;&lt;&lt;pathtofile&gt;&gt;&gt;
           include image from <u>pathtofile</u>

       &lt;&lt;&lt;pathtofile,_key=value_&gt;&gt;&gt;
           include image from <u>pathtofile</u> passing <u>key=value</u> parameters to latex

   <b>Footnotes</b>
           create a footnote containing <u>text</u>

   <b>Layout</b>
       --<u>length</u>--
           when found at start of line, with nothing afterwards, insert a \vspace{<u>length</u>} (vertical space of
           length <u>length</u>)

       --*<u>length</u>--
           same as above, but insert a \vspace* (a forced vspace)

       +&lt;_overlay_&gt;{<u>content</u>}
           \uncover the <u>content</u> on the given <u>overlay</u> subframes. They will already take up the space, they need
           to be displayed, so the geometry of the frame doesn’t change when the element pops up.

       -&lt;_overlay_&gt;{<u>content</u>}
           \only show the <u>content</u> on the given <u>overlay</u> subframes. They will not take up the space they need to
           be displayed, so the geometry of the frame changes when the element pops up.

   <b>Substitutions</b>
       --&gt;
           becomes $\rightarrow$

       ==&gt;
           becomes $\Rightarrow$

       &lt;--
           becomes $\leftarrow$

       &lt;==
           becomes $\Leftarrow$

       :-)
           becomes \smiley (requires package wasysym)

       :-(
           becomes \frownie (requires package wasysym)

   <b>Frame</b> <b>Headers/Footers</b>
       There are two variables, FRAMEHEADER and FRAMEFOOTER. The content of these will be inserted at the
       beginning/end of all following slides.

       @FRAMEHEADER=<u>text</u>
           set frameheader to <u>text</u>

       @FRAMEFOOTER=<u>text</u>
           set framefooter to <u>text</u>

       Leave text empty to reset frame headers and footers.
