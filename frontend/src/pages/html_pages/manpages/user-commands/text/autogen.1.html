</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>autogen</b> - The Automated Program Generator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>autogen</b> [<b>-flags</b>] [<b>-flag</b> [<u>value</u>]] [<b>--option-name</b>[[=| ]<u>value</u>]] [ &lt;def-file&gt; ]

       AutoGen creates text files from templates using external definitions.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>AutoGen</b>  is designed for generating program files that contain repetitive text with varied substitutions.
       The goal is to simplify the maintenance of programs that contain large amounts of repetitious text.  This
       is especially valuable if there are several blocks of such text that must be kept synchronized.

       One common example is the problem of maintaining  the  code  required  for  processing  program  options.
       Processing  options  requires a minimum of four different constructs be kept in proper order in different
       places in your program.  You need at least: The flag character in the flag string, code  to  process  the
       flag when it is encountered, a global state variable or two, and a line in the usage text.  You will need
       more  things  besides  this  if you choose to implement long option names, configuration file processing,
       environment variables and so on.

       All of this can be done mechanically; with the proper templates and this program.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>The</b> <b>following</b> <b>options</b> <b>select</b> <b>definitions,</b> <b>templates</b> <b>and</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>functions</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b>
       <b>-L</b> <u>dir</u>, <b>--templ-dirs</b>=<u>dir</u> Search for templates in <u>DIR</u>.  This option may appear an unlimited number of
       times.

       Add a directory to the list of directories <b>autogen</b> searches when opening a template, either as the
       primary template or an included one.  The last entry has the highest priority in the search list.  That
       is to say, they are searched in reverse order.

       <b>-T</b> <u>tpl-file</u>, <b>--override-tpl</b>=<u>tpl-file</u> Use <u>TPL-FILE</u> for the template.  This option may not be preset with
       environment variables or in initialization (rc) files.

       Definition files specify the standard template that is to be expanded.  This option will override that
       name and expand a different template.

       <b>--definitions</b>=<u>file</u>, <b>--no-definitions</b> Read definitions from <u>FILE</u>.  The <u>no-definitions</u> form will disable
       the option.  This option is enabled by default.  This option may not be preset with environment variables
       or in initialization (rc) files.

       Use this argument to specify the input definitions file with a command line option.  If you do not
       specify this option, then there must be a command line argument that specifies the file, even if only to
       specify stdin with a hyphen (<b>-</b>).  Specify, <b>--no-definitions</b> when you wish to process a template without
       any active AutoGen definitions.

       <b>--shell</b>=<u>shell</u> name or path name of shell to use.

       By default, when AutoGen is built, the configuration is probed for a reasonable Bourne-like shell to use
       for shell script processing.  If a particular template needs an alternate shell, it must be specified
       with this option on the command line, with an environment variable (<b>SHELL</b>) or in the
       configuration/initialization file.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--no-fmemopen</b> Do not use in-mem streams.

       If the local C library supports "<b><a href="../man3GNU/fopencookie.3GNU.html">fopencookie</a>(3GNU)</b>", or "<b><a href="../man3BSD/funopen.3BSD.html">funopen</a>(3BSD)</b>" then AutoGen prefers to use in-
       memory stream buffer opens instead of anonymous files.  This may lead to problems if there is a shortage
       of virtual memory.  If, for a particular application, you run out of memory, then specify this option.
       This is unlikely in a modern 64-bit virtual memory environment.

       On platforms without these functions, the option is accepted but ignored.  <b>fmemopen(POSIX)</b> is not
       adequate because its string buffer is not reallocatable.  <b>open_memstream(POSIX)</b> is <u>also</u> not adequate
       because the stream is only opened for output.  AutoGen needs a reallocatable buffer available for both
       reading and writing.

       <b>--equate</b>=<u>char-list</u> characters considered equivalent.  The default <u>char-list</u> for this option is:
            _-^

       This option will alter the list of characters considered equivalent.  The default are the three
       characters, "_-^".  (The last is conventional on a Tandem/HP-NonStop, and I used to do a lot of work on
       Tandems.)

          <b>The</b> <b>following</b> <b>options</b> <b>modify</b> <b>how</b> <b>output</b> <b>is</b> <b>handled</b>

       <b>-b</b> <u>name</u>, <b>--base-name</b>=<u>name</u> Specify <b>NAME</b> as the base name for output.  This option may not be preset with
       environment variables or in initialization (rc) files.

       A template may specify the exact name of the output file.  Normally, it does not.  Instead, the name is
       composed of the base name of the definitions file with suffixes appended.  This option will override the
       base name derived from the definitions file name.  This is required if there is no definitions file and
       advisable if definitions are being read from stdin.  If the definitions are being read from standard in,
       the base name defaults to <u>stdin</u>.  Any leading directory components in the name will be silently removed.
       If you wish the output file to appear in a particular directory, it is recommended that you "cd" into
       that directory first, or use directory names in the format specification for the output suffix lists,
       see: pseudo macro.

       <b>--source-time</b>, <b>--no-source-time</b> set mod times to latest source.  The <u>no-source-time</u> form will disable the
       option.

       If you stamp your output files with the <b>DNE</b> macro output, then your output files will always be
       different, even if the content has not really changed.  If you use this option, then the modification
       time of the output files will change only if the input files change.  This will help reduce unneeded
       builds.

       <b>--writable</b>, <b>--not-writable</b> Allow output files to be writable.  The <u>not-writable</u> form will disable the
       option.

       This option will leave output files writable.  Normally, output files are read-only.

          <b>The</b> <b>following</b> <b>options</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> <b>useful</b> <b>while</b> <b>debugging</b> <b>new</b> <b>templates</b>
              They specify limits that prevent the template from taking overly long  or  producing  more  output
              than expected.

       <b>--loop-limit</b>=<u>lim</u> Limit on increment loops.  This option takes an integer number as its argument.  The
       value of <u>lim</u> is constrained to being:
           exactly -1, or
           in the range  1 through 0x1000000
       The default <u>lim</u> for this option is:
            256

       This option prevents runaway loops.  For example, if you accidentally specify, "FOR x (for-from 1) (for-
       to -1) (for-by 1)", it will take a long time to finish.  If you do have more than 256 entries in tables,
       you will need to specify a new limit with this option.

       <b>-t</b> <u>seconds</u>, <b>--timeout</b>=<u>seconds</u> Limit server shell operations to <b>SECONDS</b>.  This option takes an integer
       number as its argument.  The value of <u>seconds</u> is constrained to being:
           in the range  0 through 3600

       AutoGen works with a shell server process.  Most normal commands will complete in less than 10 seconds.
       If, however, your commands need more time than this, use this option.

       The valid range is 0 to 3600 seconds (1 hour).  Zero will disable the server time limit.

       <b>--trace</b>=<u>level</u> tracing level of detail.  This option takes a keyword as its argument.  The argument sets
       an enumeration value that can be tested by comparing them against the option value macro.  The available
       keywords are:
           nothing       debug-message server-shell
           templates     block-macros  expressions
           everything
           or their numeric equivalent.

       The default <u>level</u> for this option is:
            nothing

       This option will cause AutoGen to display a trace of its template processing.  There are six levels, each
       level including messages from the previous levels:

       <u>nothing</u> Does no tracing at all (default)

       <u>debug-message</u> Print messages from the "DEBUG" AutoGen macro (see: DEBUG).

       <u>server-shell</u> Traces all input and output to the server shell.  This includes a shell "independent"
       initialization script about 30 lines long.  Its output is discarded and not inserted into any template.

       <u>templates</u> Traces the invocation of <b>DEFINE</b>d macros and <b>INCLUDE</b>s

       <u>block-macros</u> Traces all block macros.  The above, plus <b>IF</b>, <b>FOR</b>, <b>CASE</b> and <b>WHILE</b>.

       <u>expressions</u> Displays the results of expression evaluations.

       <u>everything</u> Displays the invocation of every AutoGen macro, even <b>TEXT</b> macros (i.e. the text outside of
       macro quotes).  Additionally, if you rebuild the ``expr.ini'' file with debugging enabled, then all calls
       to AutoGen defined scheme functions will also get logged:
           cd ${top_builddir}/agen5
           DEBUG_ENABLED=true bash bootstrap.dir expr.ini
           make CFLAGS='-g -DDEBUG_ENABLED=1'

       Be aware that you cannot rebuild this source in this way without first having installed the <b>autogen</b>
       executable in your search path.  Because of this, "expr.ini" is in the distributed source list, and not
       in the dependencies.

       <b>--trace-out</b>=<u>file</u> tracing output file or filter.

       The output specified may be a file name, a file that is appended to, or, if the option argument begins
       with the <b>pipe</b> operator (<b>|</b>), a command that will receive the tracing output as standard in.  For example,
       <b>--traceout='|</b> <b>less'</b> will run the trace output through the <b>less</b> program.  Appending to a file is specified
       by preceding the file name with two greater-than characters (<b>&gt;&gt;</b>).

       <b>--show-defs</b> Show the definition tree.  This option may not be preset with environment variables or in
       initialization (rc) files.

       This will print out the complete definition tree before processing the template.

       <b>--used-defines</b> Show the definitions used.  This option may not be preset with environment variables or in
       initialization (rc) files.

       This will print out the names of definition values searched for during the processing of the template,
       whether actually found or not.  There may be other referenced definitions in a template in portions of
       the template not evaluated.  Some of the names listed may be computed names and others AutoGen macro
       arguments.  This is not a means for producing a definitive, all-encompassing list of all and only the
       values used from a definition file.  This is intended as an aid to template documentation only.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--core</b> Leave a core dump on a failure exit.

       Many systems default to a zero sized core limit.  If the system has the sys/resource.h header and if this
       option is supplied, then in the failure exit path, autogen will attempt to set the soft core limit to
       whatever the hard core limit is.  If that does not work, then an administrator must raise the hard core
       size limit.  in the definitions files and template files" They specify which outputs and parts of outputs
       to produce.

       <b>-s</b> <u>suffix</u>, <b>--skip-suffix</b>=<u>suffix</u> Skip the file with this <u>SUFFIX</u>.  This option may appear an unlimited
       number of times.  This option may not be preset with environment variables or in initialization (rc)
       files.  This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options: select-suffix.

       Occasionally, it may not be desirable to produce all of the output files specified in the template.  (For
       example, only the <u>.h</u> header file, but not the <u>.c</u> program text.)  To do this specify <b>--skip-suffix=c</b> on
       the command line.

       <b>-o</b> <u>suffix</u>, <b>--select-suffix</b>=<u>suffix</u> specify this output suffix.  This option may appear an unlimited number
       of times.  This option may not be preset with environment variables or in initialization (rc) files.

       If you wish to override the suffix specifications in the template, you can use one or more copies of this
       option.  See the suffix specification in the @ref{pseudo macro} section of the info doc.

       <b>-D</b> <u>value</u>, <b>--define</b>=<u>value</u> name to add to definition list.  This option may appear an unlimited number of
       times.

       The AutoGen define names are used for the following purposes:

       Sections of the AutoGen definitions may be enabled or disabled by using C-style #ifdef and #ifndef
       directives.

       When defining a value for a name, you may specify the index for a particular value.  That index may be a
       literal value, a define option or a value #define-d in the definitions themselves.

       The name of a file may be prefixed with <b>$NAME/</b>.  The <b>$NAME</b> part of the name string will be replaced with
       the define-d value for <b>NAME</b>.

       When AutoGen is finished loading the definitions, the defined values are exported to the environment
       with, <b><a href="../man3/putenv.3.html">putenv</a>(3)</b>.  These values can then be used in shell scripts with <b>${NAME@</b>} references and in
       templates with <b>(getenv</b> <b>"NAME")</b>.

       While processing a template, you may specify an index to retrieve a specific value.  That index may also
       be a define-d value.

       It is entirely equivalent to place this name in the exported environment.  Internally, that is what
       AutoGen actually does with this option.

       <b>-U</b> <u>name-pat</u>, <b>--undefine</b>=<u>name-pat</u> definition list removal pattern.  This option may appear an unlimited
       number of times.  This option may not be preset with environment variables or in initialization (rc)
       files.

       Similar to 'C', AutoGen uses <b>#ifdef/#ifndef</b> preprocessing directives.  This option will cause the
       matching names to be removed from the list of defined values.

          <b>This</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>automate</b> <b>dependency</b> <b>tracking</b>

       <b>-M</b> <u>type</u>, <b>--make-dep</b> [<u>type</u>] emit make dependency file.  This option may appear an unlimited number of
       times.  This option may not be preset with environment variables or in initialization (rc) files.

       This option behaves fairly closely to the way the <b>-M</b> series of options work with the gcc compiler, except
       that instead of just emitting the predecessor dependencies, this also emits the successor dependencies
       (output target files).  By default, the output dependency information will be placed in <b>&lt;base-name&gt;.d</b>,
       but may also be specified with <b>-MF&lt;file&gt;</b>.  The time stamp on this file will be manipulated so that it
       will be one second older than the oldest primary output file.

       The target in this dependency file will normally be the dependency file name, but may also be overridden
       with <b>-MT&lt;targ-name&gt;</b>.  AutoGen will not alter the contents of that file, but it may create it and it will
       adjust the modification time to match the start time.

       <b>NB:</b> these second letters are part of the option argument, so <b>-MF</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> must have the space character
       quoted or omitted, and <b>-M</b> <b>"F</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;"</b> is acceptable because the <b>F</b> is part of the option argument.

       <b>-M</b> may be followed by any of the letters M, F, P, T, Q, D, or G.  However, only F, Q, T and P are
       meaningful.  All but F have somewhat different meanings.  <b>-MT&lt;name&gt;</b> is interpreted as meaning <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> is a
       sentinel file that will depend on all inputs (templates and definition files) and all the output files
       will depend on this sentinel file.  It is suitable for use as a real make target.  Q is treated
       identically to T, except dollar characters ('$') are doubled.  P causes a special clean (clobber) phoney
       rule to be inserted into the make file fragment.  An empty rule is always created for building the list
       of targets.

       This is the recommended usage:
             -MFwhatever-you-like.dep -MTyour-sentinel-file -MP
       and then in your <b>Makefile</b>, make the <u>autogen</u> rule:
             -include whatever-you-like.dep
             clean_targets += clean-your-sentinel-file
           .sp
             your-sentinel-file:
                 autogen -MT$@@ -MF$*.d .....
           .sp
             local-clean :
                 rm -f $(clean_targets)

       The modification time on the dependency file is adjusted to be one second before the earliest time stamp
       of any other output file.  Consequently, it is suitable for use as the sentinel file testifying to the
       fact the program was successfully run.  (<b>-include</b> is the GNU make way of specifying "include it if it
       exists".  Your make must support that feature or your bootstrap process must create the file.)

       All of this may also be specified using the <b>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</b> or <b>AUTOGEN_MAKE_DEP</b> environment
       variables.  If defined, dependency information will be output.  If defined with white space free text
       that is something other than <b>true</b>, <b>false</b>, <b>yes</b>, <b>no</b>, <b>0</b> or <b>1</b>, then the string is taken to be an output file
       name.  If it contains a string of white space characters, the first token is as above and the second
       token is taken to be the target (sentinel) file as <b>-MT</b> in the paragraphs above.  <b>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</b> will
       be ignored if there are multiple sequences of white space characters or if its contents are,
       specifically, <b>false</b>, <b>no</b> or <b>0</b>.

          <b>help,</b> <b>version,</b> <b>option</b> <b>and</b> <b>error</b> <b>handling</b>

       <b>--no-abort</b> Do not abort on errors.

       By default, <b>AutoGen</b> will abort on an error leaving behind a core image.  That is sometimes inconvenient.
       If present on the command line or in the environment, AutoGen will call <b><a href="../man1/exit.1.html">exit</a>(1)</b> instead of <b>abort()</b>.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b> Display usage information and exit.

       <b>-!</b>, <b>--more-help</b> Pass the extended usage information through a pager.

       <b>-&gt;</b> [<u>cfgfile</u>], <b>--save-opts</b> [=<u>cfgfile</u>] Save the option state to <u>cfgfile</u>.  The default is the <u>last</u>
       configuration file listed in the <b>OPTION</b> <b>PRESETS</b> section, below.  The command will exit after updating the
       config file.

       <b>-&lt;</b> <u>cfgfile</u>, <b>--load-opts</b>=<u>cfgfile</u>, <b>--no-load-opts</b> Load options from <u>cfgfile</u>.  The <u>no-load-opts</u> form will
       disable the loading of earlier config/rc/ini files.  <u>--no-load-opts</u> is handled early, out of order.

       <b>-v</b> [{<u>v|c|n</u> <b>--version</b> [{<u>v|c|n</u>}]}] Output version of program and exit.  The default mode is `v', a simple
       version.  The `c' mode will print copyright information and `n' will print the full copyright notice.

       <b>OPTION</b> <b>PRESETS</b>
              Any  option  that  is  not  marked  as  <u>not</u>  <u>presettable</u>  may  be  preset  by  loading values from
              configuration ("RC" or ".INI") file(s) and values from environment variables named:
                <b>AUTOGEN_&lt;option-name&gt;</b> or <b>AUTOGEN</b>
              The environmental presets take precedence (are processed later than) the configuration files.  The
              <u>homerc</u> files are "<u>$HOME</u>", and "<u>.</u>".  If any of these are directories, then the file  <u>.autogenrc</u>  is
              searched for within those directories.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       See <b>OPTION</b> <b>PRESETS</b> for configuration environment variables.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       See <b>OPTION</b> <b>PRESETS</b> for configuration files.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Here is how the man page is produced:
           autogen -Tagman-cmd.tpl -MFman-dep -MTstamp-man opts.def

       This  command  produced this man page from the AutoGen option definition file.  It overrides the template
       specified in <u>opts.def</u> (normally <u>options.tpl</u>)  and  uses  <u>agman-cmd.tpl</u>.   It  also  sets  the  make  file
       dependency  output to <u>man-dep</u> and the sentinel file (time stamp file) to <u>man-stamp</u>.  The base of the file
       name is derived from the defined <b>prog-name</b>.

       The texi invocation document is produced via:
           autogen -Tagtexi-cmd.tpl -MFtexi-dep -MTtexi-stamp opts.def

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       One of the following exit values will be returned:

       0  (EXIT_SUCCESS) Successful program execution.

       1  (EXIT_OPTION_ERROR) The command options were misconfigured.

       2  (EXIT_BAD_TEMPLATE) An error was encountered processing the template.

       3  (EXIT_BAD_DEFINITIONS) The definitions could not be deciphered.

       4  (EXIT_LOAD_ERROR) An error was encountered during the load phase.

       5  (EXIT_FS_ERROR) a file system error stopped the program.

       6  (EXIT_NO_MEM) Insufficient memory to operate.

       128  (EXIT_SIGNAL) <b>autogen</b> exited due to catching a signal.  If your template includes string formatting,
       a number argument to a "%s" formatting element will trigger a segmentation fault.  Autogen will catch the
       seg fault signal and exit with <b><a href="../man5/AUTOGEN_EXIT_SIGNAL.5.html">AUTOGEN_EXIT_SIGNAL</a>(5)</b>.  Alternatively, AutoGen may have been interrupted
       with a <b><a href="../man2/kill.2.html">kill</a>(2)</b> signal.  Subtract 128 from the actual exit code to detect the signal number.

       66  (EX_NOINPUT) A specified configuration file could not be loaded.

       70  (EX_SOFTWARE) libopts had an internal operational error.  Please report it to autogen-
       <a href="mailto:users@lists.sourceforge.net">users@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.  Thank you.
