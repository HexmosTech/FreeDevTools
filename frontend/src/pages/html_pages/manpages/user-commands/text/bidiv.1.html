       bidiv - bidirectional text filter

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bidiv</b> [ <b>-plj</b> ] [ <b>-w</b> <u>width</u> ] <b>[</b><u>file...</u><b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bidiv</b>  is  a  filter, or viewer, for birectional text stored in logical-order. It converts such text into
       visual-order text which can be viewed on terminals  that  do  not  handle  bidirectionality.  The  output
       visual-order  text  is formatted assuming a fixed number of characters per line (automatically determined
       or given with the <b>-w</b> parameter).

       <b>bidiv</b> is oriented towards Hebrew, and assumes the input to be a Hebrew and ASCII text encoded in  one  of
       the  two  common  logical-order encodings: ISO-8859-8-i or UTF-8. Actually, bidiv guesses the encoding of
       its input at a character by character basis, so the input might be  a  mix  of  ISO-8859-8-i  and  Hebrew
       UTF-8.   <b>bidiv</b>'s  output  is  visual-order text, in either the ISO-8859-8 or UTF-8 encoding, depending on
       your locale setting.

       <b>bidiv</b> reads each <u>file</u> in sequence, converts it into visual order and writes it on  the  standard  output.
       Thus:

              <b>$</b> <b>bidiv</b> <b>file</b>

       prints  <b>file</b>  on  your terminal (assuming it has the appropriate fonts, but no bidirectionality support),
       and:

              <b>$</b> <b>bidiv</b> <b>file1</b> <b>file2</b> <b>|</b> <b>less</b>

       concatenates <b>file1</b> and <b>file2</b>, and shows the results using the pager <b>less</b>.

       If no input file is given, <b>bidiv</b> reads from the standard input file.

       For more ideas on how to use <b>bidiv</b>, see the <b>EXAMPLES</b> section below.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-p</b>     Paragraph-based direction (default): When formatting a bidirectional output line, <b>bidiv</b>  needs  to
              be  aware  of  that line's base direction. A line whose base direction is RTL (right to left) gets
              right-justified and its first element appears on the right. Otherwise, the line is  left-justified
              and its first element appears on the left.

              The <b>-p</b> option tells <b>bidiv</b> to choose a base direction per paragraph, where a paragraph is delimited
              by an empty line. This is bidiv's default behavior, and usually gives the expected results on most
              texts and emails.

              The  direction  of  the  entire  paragraph  is  chosen according to the first strongly-directioned
              character (i.e., an alphabetic character) appearing in the  paragraph.  Currently,  if  the  first
              output  line  of  a paragraph has no directional characters (e.g., a line of minus signs before an
              email signature, or a line containing only numbers) that line is output with the same direction of
              the previous paragraph, but it does not determine the direction of the rest of the  paragraph.  If
              the  first line of the first paragraph does not have a direction, the RTL direction is arbitrarily
              chosen.

       <b>-l</b>     Line-based direction: This option choose an alternative method of choosing each output line's base
              direction. When this option is enabled, the base direction of each output line  is  determined  on
              its own (again, according to the first character on the line with a strong direction). This method
              may give wrong results in the case where a line starts with a word of the opposite direction. This
              case  is  rare,  but  does  happen  under random line-splitting circumstances, or when the text is
              defining words of a foreign language.

       <b>-j</b>     Do not justify: By default, RTL lines are right-justified, i.e., they are padded  with  spaces  on
              the  left when shorter than the required line width (see the <b>-w</b> option). The <b>-j</b> option tells <b>bidiv</b>
              not to preform this justifications, and leave short lines unpadded.

       <b>-w</b> <u>width</u>
              <b>bidiv</b> formats its output for lines of the given width. Lines  are  split  when  longer  than  this
              width, and RTL lines are right-justfied to fill that width unless the <b>-j</b> option is given.

              When  the  <b>-w</b>  option is not given, <b>bidiv</b> uses the value of the <b>COLUMNS</b> variable, which is usually
              automatically defined by the user's shell.  When that both the <b>-w</b> option and the <b>COLUMNS</b>  variable
              are missing, the default of 80 columns is used.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operand is supported:

       <u>file</u>    A path name of an input file.  If no <u>file</u> is specified, the standard input is used.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       1. bidiv README | less

       2. man something | bidiv | less

          (or groff -man -Tlatin1 something.1 |sed 's/.^H\(.\)/\1/g' |../bidiv -w 65)

       3. set  "bidiv"  as  a  filter  for  your  mail  program (mutt, pine, etc.) for viewing mail with the ISO
          8859-8-i character set, and Hebrew UTF-8 mail.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>COLUMNS</b> see <b>-w</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values are returned:

       <b>0</b>   All input files were output successfully.

       <b>&gt;0</b>  An error occurred.
