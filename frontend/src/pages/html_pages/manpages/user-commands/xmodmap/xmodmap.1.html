</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xmodmap - utility for modifying keymaps and pointer button mappings in X

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xmodmap</b> [-options ...] [filename]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>xmodmap</u> program is used to edit and display the keyboard <u>modifier</u> <u>map</u> and <u>keymap</u> <u>table</u> that are used
       by client applications to convert event keycodes into keysyms.  It is usually run from the user's session
       startup script to configure the keyboard according to personal tastes.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options may be used with <u>xmodmap</u>:

       <b>-display</b> <u>display</u>
               This option specifies the host and display to use.

       <b>-help</b>   This option indicates that a brief description of the command line arguments should be printed on
               the standard error channel.  This will be  done  whenever  an  unhandled  argument  is  given  to
               <u>xmodmap.</u>

       <b>-grammar</b>
               This  option  indicates  that  a help message describing the expression grammar used in files and
               with -e expressions should be printed on the standard error.

       <b>-version</b>
               This option indicates that <u>xmodmap</u> should print its version information and exit.

       <b>-verbose</b>
               This option indicates that <u>xmodmap</u> should print logging information as it parses its input.

       <b>-quiet</b>  This option turns off the verbose logging.  This is the default.

       <b>-n</b>      This option indicates that <u>xmodmap</u> should not change the mappings, but  should  display  what  it
               would do, like <u><a href="../man1/make.1.html">make</a>(1)</u> does when given this option.

       <b>-e</b> <u>expression</u>
               This  option  specifies an expression to be executed.  Any number of expressions may be specified
               from the command line.

       <b>-pm</b>     This option indicates that the current modifier map should be printed  on  the  standard  output.
               This is the default mode of operation if no other mode options are specified.

       <b>-pk</b>     This option indicates that the current keymap table should be printed on the standard output.

       <b>-pke</b>    This  option  indicates that the current keymap table should be printed on the standard output in
               the form of expressions that can be fed back to <u>xmodmap</u>.

       <b>-pp</b>     This option indicates that the current pointer map should be printed on the standard output.

       <b>-</b>       A lone dash means that the standard input should be used as the input file.

       The <u>filename</u> specifies a file containing <u>xmodmap</u> expressions to be executed.  This file is  usually  kept
       in the user's home directory with a name like <u>.xmodmaprc</u>.

</pre><h4><b>EXPRESSION</b> <b>GRAMMAR</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>xmodmap</u>  program reads a list of expressions and parses them all before attempting to execute any of
       them.  This makes it possible to refer to keysyms that are being  redefined  in  a  natural  way  without
       having to worry as much about name conflicts.

       The  list  of  keysym  names  may be found in the header file <u>&lt;X11/keysymdef.h&gt;</u> (without the <u>XK</u><b>_</b> prefix).
       Keysyms matching Unicode characters may be specified as "U0020" to "U007E" and "U00A0" to  "U10FFFF"  for
       all possible Unicode characters.

       <b>keycode</b> <u>NUMBER</u> <b>=</b> <u>KEYSYMNAME</u> <u>...</u>
               The  list of keysyms is assigned to the indicated keycode (which may be specified in decimal, hex
               or octal and can be determined by running the <u>xev</u> program).  Up to eight keysyms may be  attached
               to  a  key,  however  the last four are not used in any major X server implementation.  The first
               keysym is used when no modifier key is pressed in conjunction with  this  key,  the  second  with
               Shift,  the  third  when  the  Mode_switch key is used with this key and the fourth when both the
               Mode_switch and Shift keys are used.

       <b>keycode</b> <b>any</b> <b>=</b> <u>KEYSYMNAME</u> <u>...</u>
               If no existing key has the specified list of keysyms assigned to it, a spare key on the  keyboard
               is selected and the keysyms are assigned to it.  The list of keysyms may be specified in decimal,
               hex or octal.

       <b>keysym</b> <u>KEYSYMNAME</u> <b>=</b> <u>KEYSYMNAME</u> <u>...</u>
               The  <u>KEYSYMNAME</u>  on  the  left hand side is translated into matching keycodes used to perform the
               corresponding set of <b>keycode</b> expressions.  Note that if the same  keysym  is  bound  to  multiple
               keys, the expression is executed for each matching keycode.

       <b>clear</b> <u>MODIFIERNAME</u>
               This removes all entries in the modifier map for the given modifier, where valid name are: <b>Shift</b>,
               <b>Lock</b>, <b>Control</b>, <b>Mod1</b>, <b>Mod2</b>, <b>Mod3</b>, <b>Mod4</b>, and <b>Mod5</b> (case does not matter in modifier names, although
               it  does  matter for all other names).  For example, ``clear Lock'' will remove all any keys that
               were bound to the shift lock modifier.

       <b>add</b> <u>MODIFIERNAME</u> <b>=</b> <u>KEYSYMNAME</u> <u>...</u>
               This adds all keys containing the given keysyms to the indicated modifier map.  The keysym  names
               are  evaluated  after all input expressions are read to make it easy to write expressions to swap
               keys (see the EXAMPLES section).

       <b>remove</b> <u>MODIFIERNAME</u> <b>=</b> <u>KEYSYMNAME</u> <u>...</u>
               This removes all keys containing the given keysyms from the indicated modifier map.  Unlike  <b>add,</b>
               the  keysym  names  are  evaluated as the line is read in.  This allows you to remove keys from a
               modifier without having to worry about whether or not they have been reassigned.

       <b>pointer</b> <b>=</b> <b>default</b>
               This sets the pointer map back to its default settings (button 1 generates a code of 1, button  2
               generates a 2, etc.).

       <b>pointer</b> <b>=</b> <u>NUMBER</u> <u>...</u>
               This sets the pointer map to contain the indicated button codes.  The list always starts with the
               first physical button.  Setting a button code to 0 disables events from that button.

       Lines that begin with an exclamation point (!) are taken as comments.

       If  you  want  to  change  the  binding  of  a modifier key, you must also remove it from the appropriate
       modifier map.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Many pointers are designed such that the first button is pressed using the  index  finger  of  the  right
       hand.  People who are left-handed frequently find that it is more comfortable to reverse the button codes
       that  get  generated so that the primary button is pressed using the index finger of the left hand.  This
       could be done on a 3 button pointer as follows:
       %  xmodmap -e "pointer = 3 2 1"

       Many applications support the notion of Meta keys (similar to Control keys except that Meta is held  down
       instead of Control).  However, some servers do not have a Meta keysym in the default keymap table, so one
       needs  to  be added by hand.  The following command will attach Meta to the Multi-language key (sometimes
       labeled Compose Character).  It also takes advantage of the fact that applications that need a  Meta  key
       simply  need  to  get  the  keycode  and don't require the keysym to be in the first column of the keymap
       table.  This means that applications that are looking for a Multi_key  (including  the  default  modifier
       map) won't notice any change.
       %  xmodmap -e "keysym Multi_key = Multi_key Meta_L"

       Similarly, some keyboards have an Alt key but no Meta key.  In that case the following may be useful:
       %  xmodmap -e "keysym Alt_L = Meta_L Alt_L"

       One of the more simple, yet convenient, uses of <u>xmodmap</u> is to set the keyboard's "rubout" key to generate
       an alternate keysym.  This frequently involves exchanging Backspace with Delete to be more comfortable to
       the  user.   If the <u>ttyModes</u> resource in <u>xterm</u> is set as well, all terminal emulator windows will use the
       same key for erasing characters:
       %  xmodmap -e "keysym BackSpace = Delete"
       %  echo "XTerm*ttyModes:  erase ^?" | xrdb -merge

       Some keyboards do not automatically generate less than and greater than characters  when  the  comma  and
       period  keys  are shifted.  This can be remedied with <u>xmodmap</u> by resetting the bindings for the comma and
       period with the following scripts:
       !
       ! make shift-, be &lt; and shift-. be &gt;
       !
       keysym comma = comma less
       keysym period = period greater

       One of the more irritating differences between keyboards is the location  of  the  Control  and  CapsLock
       keys.  A common use of <u>xmodmap</u> is to swap these two keys as follows:
       !
       ! Swap Caps_Lock and Control_L
       !
       remove Lock = Caps_Lock
       remove Control = Control_L
       keysym Control_L = Caps_Lock
       keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
       add Lock = Caps_Lock
       add Control = Control_L

       This example can be run again to swap the keys back to their previous assignments.

       The  <u>keycode</u>  command is useful for assigning the same keysym to multiple keycodes.  Although unportable,
       it also makes it possible to write scripts that can reset the keyboard to a known state.   The  following
       script  sets  the  backspace  key  to  generate  Delete  (as shown above), flushes all existing caps lock
       bindings, makes the CapsLock key be a control key, make F5 generate Escape, and makes  Break/Reset  be  a
       shift lock.
       !
       ! On the HP, the following keycodes have key caps as listed:
       !
       !     101  Backspace
       !      55  Caps
       !      14  Ctrl
       !      15  Break/Reset
       !      86  Stop
       !      89  F5
       !
       keycode 101 = Delete
       keycode 55 = Control_R
       clear Lock
       add Control = Control_R
       keycode 89 = Escape
       keycode 15 = Caps_Lock
       add Lock = Caps_Lock

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Every time a <b>keycode</b> expression is evaluated, the server generates a <u>MappingNotify</u> event on every client.
       This  can cause some thrashing.  All of the changes should be batched together and done at once.  Clients
       that receive keyboard input and ignore <u>MappingNotify</u> events will not notice any changes made to  keyboard
       mappings.

       <u>Xmodmap</u>  should  generate "add" and "remove" expressions automatically whenever a keycode that is already
       bound to a modifier is changed.

       There should be a way to have the <u>remove</u> expression accept keycodes as well as keysyms  for  those  times
       when you really mess up your mappings.
