</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Tlf</b>  is  a console (ncurses) mode general purpose CW keyer, logging and contest program for amateur radio
       operators.  It supports the CQWW, WPX, ARRL-DX, ARRL-FD, STEWPERRY, PACC,  FOC  Marathon  and  EU  SPRINT
       contests  as  well  as  a lot more basic contests, general QSO and DXpedition mode.  It interfaces with a
       Morse Code generator, a number of radios via the <b>Hamlib</b> library, and with a  <b>DX</b>  <b>Cluster</b>  via  telnet  or
       packet radio.  Tlf can project DX cluster data into the excellent Xplanet program, written by Hari Nair.

       Contest  operation  mimics the popular <b>TR-Log</b> program for DOS, the output file is TR-Log compatible.  The
       log can be exported in ADIF or <b>Cabrillo</b> <b>3.0</b> format.

       The program was written for console mode on purpose, which allows it  to  run  on  smaller  machines,  or
       remotely via SSH or a modem link.

       CW  keying via <b>cwdaemon</b> is fully supported, featuring direct mode for the keyboard and output to parallel
       and serial ports and speed and weight control from the keyboard, and band info  output  on  the  parallel
       port.   Likewise, CW keying via <b>Hamlib</b> is supported for rigs that feature the capability. Tlf can set the
       CW speed, and at the same time read back the speed if changed using the knob on the rig.

       For users of the K1EL series of “Win Keyers”, the <b>winkeydaemon</b> is available from GitHub.   Setup  is  the
       same as for <b><a href="../man1/cwdaemon.1.html">cwdaemon</a></b>(1).

       For radio control Tlf works with Hamlib (version &gt;= 1.2.8), you can find it at www.hamlib.org.

       Tlf  provides  full TCP/IP networking between Tlf nodes, syncing/distributing log, packet data, frequency
       data, local talk, serial numbers, time sync etc.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options given to Tlf on the command line.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print a summary of options to the screen and exit.

       <b>-f</b> <u>config_file</u>
       <b>--config=</b><u>config_file</u>
              Start with a non-default configuration file:

              tlf -f PA0R

              Defaults to <u>logcfg.dat</u> in the current working directory.

       <b>-s</b> <u>user:password@host/dir/logfilename</u>
       <b>--sync=</b><u>user:password@host/dir/logfilename</u>
              Synchronize log with other node

              tlf -s user:password@host/dir/logfilename

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--no-cluster</b>
              Start without packet/cluster.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--no-rig</b>
              Start without radio control.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--list</b>
              List all built-in contests.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--import</b>
              Import an existing Cabrillo file and generate Tlf log files.

              When Tlf starts, it looks for <u>YOURCALL.cbr</u> file in the current directory, reads the  configuration
              and  rule  files,  and based on the current setup generates the log(s).  If the contest is WAE and
              you have QTCs in Cabrillo, then Tlf generates the QTC logfiles.   Tlf  will  not  write  over  the
              existing log(s).

              The  generated  import will be <u>IMPORT_CONTEST.log</u>, where the CONTEST is the name of contest in the
              config.  If QTC exists,  then  the  files  <u>IMPORT_QTC_sent.log</u>  and  <u>IMPORT_QTC_recv.log</u>  will  be
              created.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Verbose startup.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--debug</b>
              Debug <b><a href="../man1/rigctld.1.html">rigctld</a></b>(1).

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Print the version information to the screen and exit.

       <b>--usage</b>
              Print a short usage message to the screen and exit.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Tlf  has been written for <b>console</b> <b>mode</b>.  If you want to run Tlf from a terminal in <b>X</b> or <b>Wayland</b>, you will
       probably get the best results if you set <b>TERM</b>=<u>linux</u> and use a Linux console terminal.  Both KDE and GNOME
       terminals have a facility to start a Linux console in an X terminal as does Xfce-terminal.

       By default, <b><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man1/urxvt.1.html">urxvt</a></b>(1) may give unreadable colours.  If so, you  will  have  to  set  different
       colours  in  <u>logcfg.dat</u>  or prepare <u>$HOME/.Xresources</u> to the preferred colour scheme (a sample Xresources
       file that contains usage instructions is included in the doc directory).  One advantage of xterm or urxvt
       are that they do not consume the <b>F11</b> key which other terminal emulators reserve for full screen mode  nor
       <b>Ctrl-PgUp</b>/<b>Ctrl-PgDn</b> which may be used for tab switching in other emulators.

       Recent  efforts  have  resulted  in  improved  keyboard handling.  If you find keys that do not work, the
       developers would like to receive your report of which keys and which terminal have the  problem.   Please
       send the report to the mailing list shown in the <b>BUGS</b> section below.

       There  are  excellent  results  with  the  latest KDE, GNOME, and Xfce terminal emulators (vi colours are
       preferred by some).  As Tlf uses ncurses to format its display you must use a proper font.  (Good choices
       are the Linux font, Inconsolata, Hack, or any monospace font that dots or slashes  the  zero  character).
       If you have problems, try the linux text console first and work from there.

       Normally you start or restart Tlf in fast mode with “<b>tlf</b>”.  During debugging of a <u>logcfg.dat</u> file you can
       start  in verbose mode, to have a look at the startup messages.  The config file can also be specified on
       command line:

              tlf -f config_file

       If you have the packet cluster enabled you will first see the packet screen (if you are using telnet  and
       you  have  provided  your callsign in <u>logcfg.dat</u> you will be automatically logged in switched to the main
       logging screen).  Log in with your callsign, if needed, and switch to the main logging  screen  with  the
       ‘:’  command.   You can come back to the packet screen later with the <b>:PAC</b>ket command from the call input
       field of the main logging screen.

       You can exit and close Tlf with the <b>:EXI</b>t or <b>:QUI</b>t commands or with <b>Alt-X</b>.

       At restart Tlf recalculates the score, which may take some time depending on the number of  QSOs  in  the
       logfile  and  the  speed of your system.  Tlf takes the points as they are in the log, and calculates the
       multiplier from either callsign or exchange field (depending on the contest).

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       These commands are entered in the <b>callsign</b> field of the main logging screen.  Each  command  consists  of
       the  leading  ‘:’ and at minimum the upper case characters of the command name plus any needed parameters
       separated by ‘Space’.

       <b>:ADI</b>f  Writes the log to an Amateur Data Interchange Format (ADIF) file <u>logfile.adif</u>.

       <b>:CHA</b>r  Input the number of characters for CW auto-start or ‘m’ for manual start.   Possible  values  are:
              ‘0’ (off), ‘2’...‘5’ or ‘m’ (manual).

              After  typing  as  many  characters in the input field or after pressing the ‘Enter’ key in manual
              mode Tlf starts sending the callsign without further keystrokes.  You can type in the rest of  the
              call  (but  quickly).   As soon as the sending catches your last typed character Tlf automatically
              sends the exchange and the cursor jumps to the exchange field.

              ‘Escape’ stops sending.

              This works only in CW contests in RUN mode.

       <b>:SIM</b>ulator
              Toggle simulator mode On|Off.  In simulator mode you can work a complete CQWW CW contest in TR-Log
              mode.  Set <b>CONTEST</b>=<u>cqww</u>.

       <b>:SOU</b>nd Opens the sound recorder menu.

              The  sound  recorder  is  a utility for recording the voice keyer messages and enables recording a
              complete contest in chunks of 1 hour to the hard drive.

              Using the sound recorder requires the installation of the <b><a href="../man1/sox.1.html">sox</a></b>(1) package, which provides  the  <b>rec</b>
              utilities used by the script.

              For  recording  voice  messages,  the keys <b>F1</b>–<b>F12</b>, <b>s</b>, or <b>c</b> will record the voice keyer message for
              that key.

              The sound recorder uses the <u>/usr/bin/soundlog</u> script  which  should  already  be  installed  to  a
              location in the <u>$PATH</u>.  The recording is written to the <u>./soundlogs</u> directory by default.

              The  <u>soundlog</u>  script  now defaults to the <u>rec</u> utility provided with the Sox package.  The command
              syntax is not compatible with the previous default <u>rec</u> utility.

              The previous default <u>rec</u> utility is assumed to be from the Open Sound System (OSS) package  (sound
              system used on Linux prior to ALSA).  Its default soundcard device is <u>/dev/dsp</u>.  To enable the OSS
              version uncomment the needed line in the <u>soundlog</u> script and comment the Sox <u>rec</u> line.

              The recorded file extension is <u>.au</u>, the Sun μ–law format.

              The  recorder  produces  less  than  60  MegaBytes  per  hour in single channel mode.  Recording a
              complete 48 hour CQWW event requires less than 3 GigaBytes of disk space.   If  local  disk  space
              must be preserved, the sound file can be moved to another host using FTP, rsync, scp, or any other
              network transfer protocol.

              Sound recorder menu:

              <b>1</b>: Start/Stop contest recording to <u>ddhhmm</u>.au.

              <b>2</b>: List contest recordings and play back selected recording <u>ddhhmm.</u>

              To  create  a  new  file  every  hour add a <b><a href="../man1/crontab.1.html">crontab</a></b>(1) job to run the following command every hour
              (syntax for SoX <u>rec</u> shown):

                     <a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?pkill">/usr/bin/pkill</a> -x rec

                     Running the crontab job at other intervals will create sound  recordings  of  the  interval
                     period in length.

              Once  started  the  recorder  will run until the lock file <u>$HOME/.VRlock</u> is removed and the script
              gets stopped (performed by menu item 1).

              If you leave TLF with the recorder running TLF will  ask  for  confirmation.   Depending  on  your
              answer  TLF  can  stop  it  or keep it running. In the latter case just restart TLF and use :sound
              again to stop it.

              Cabling and setting up the radio to record both received and  transmitted  audio  is  left  as  an
              exercise for the reader simply due to the variety of radios and station configurations.

              To  ease  the  adaption  to  the  local  environment record and play back commands for voice keyer
              messages and contest audio  can  be  configured  by  the  following  keywords:  <u>VK_RECORD_COMMAND,</u>
              <u>VK_PLAY_COMMAND,</u> <u>SOUNDLOG_RECORD_COMMAND</u> and <u>SOUNDLOG_PLAY_COMMAND.</u>  The directory where soundlogs
              gets stored can be configured with <u>SOUNDLOG_DIRECTORY.</u>  See “Sound Commands” section below.

       <b>:SYN</b>c  Synchronize   the   logfile   of   this  node  with  the  logfile  pointed  to  by  the  parameter
              <b>SYNCFILE</b>=<u>user:password@host/dir/logfile</u>.  Tlf will <b><a href="../man1/wget.1.html">wget</a></b>(1) the logfile  from  the  relevant  node,
              make a dated backup of your local logfile, and merge the 2 files.  The score will be recalculated.

       <b>:TON</b>e [<u>dd</u>]<u>d</u>
              Set PC sidetone frequency in Hertz.

              Range: 300–900, 0 = Off.

       <b>:TRX</b>control
              Toggle rig control On|Off.

              Default  is  Off  unless  <b>RADIO_CONTROL</b>  is given in <u>logcfg.dat</u> (only makes sense with rig control
              capability).

       <b>:VIE</b>w  View the log with <b><a href="../man1/less.1.html">less</a></b>(1).

       <b>:WRI</b>te Write Cabrillo file according to specified format (see <b>CABRILLO</b> statement in the <b>RULES</b> section).

              The file is created in the current directory as <u>YOURCALL.cbr</u> (with slashes  as  part  of  YOURCALL
              converted to underscores, such as WX9XYZ/8.cbr to WX9XYZ_8.cbr).

</pre><h4><b>KEYS</b></h4><pre>
       Work  has  been  ongoing to unify the key map between the Linux text console and the various X terminals.
       It may be slightly different on certain X terminals depending on which keys they consume  for  their  own
       use.  Turn off any key recognition by the terminal for its own purposes (menu access, help display, etc.)
       if  possible.   Pay  special  attention to the F1-F12 and Alt-&lt;<u>char</u>&gt; keys.  Moreover, on some systems you
       must set the <b>TERM</b>=<u>linux</u> or <b>TERM</b>=<u>rxvt</u> environment variable, although variables such as <u>xterm</u>, <u>xterm-color,</u>
       or <u>xterm-256color</u> should work.  This also works under VNC.

       Certain key combinations will probably not be usable as the Linux console consumes Alt-F1 through  Alt-F<u>x</u>
       (often  F7,  but  could  be  greater)  for switching its virtual consoles.  Likewise, the various desktop
       environments consume key combinations for their own use.  Ctrl-F1 through  Ctrl-F<u>x</u>  are  used  to  switch
       desktop  workspaces.   Alt-F<u>x</u>  combinations are used for various desktop features and are unavailable for
       Tlf use.

       Some desktop terminal emulators are capable of being configured to allow the application running in  them
       to  get  all  of  the  keys the desktop environment does not consume.  In testing good choices seem to be
       Gnome Terminal, Rox Terminal, or the classic Xterm  (although  its  default  color  presentation  differs
       slightly  from  the  Linux  console  and other terminal emulators) or URxvt (with a very distinct default
       color palette).  Xfce Terminal is known to consume  F11  and  Ctrl-PageUp  and  Ctrl-PageDown.   The  Tlf
       developers  have  implemented  Alt-PageUp  and  Alt-PageDown  as a work-around for the Ctrl counterparts.
       Reports of success with other terminals are welcome.

   <b>Call</b> <b>Input</b> <b>and</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Fields</b>
       The Call Input and Exchange Fields are the two main entry  fields  of  Tlf  where  the  majority  of  the
       keyboard  entry  takes  place.   The call input field is active when Tlf completes its initialization and
       presents the main screen.

       Most key sequences are the same in both fields.  Differences are noted as necessary.

       <b>A-Z</b>, <b>0-9</b>, <b>/</b>
              <b>Call</b> <b>input</b>: ASCII letters,  numerals,  and  the  <b>/</b>  character  that  make  up  an  internationally
              recognized amateur radio callsign plus temporary location identifiers.  Spaces are not allowed.

              <b>Exchange</b>:  information  provided  by  the other station possibly separated by spaces, such as ARRL
              Field Day and ARRL Sweepstakes.

       <b>Space</b>  Switch from call input to exchange field.

              Separates exchange field elements when multiple exchange elements must be entered,  such  as  ARRL
              Field Day and ARRL Sweepstakes.

       <b>Tab</b>    Switch between call input and exchange fields (jump back to call input from exchange field).

       <b>Enter</b>  Smart key depending on contest mode.

              Tlf follows the TR operating style which has two modes, <b>CQ</b> and <b>S&amp;P</b> (Search and Pounce).

              <b>CQ</b>  mode  is used for “running”, that is staying on one frequency and having other stations answer
              your call.

              <b>S&amp;P</b> mode is for tuning up or down the band and answering the calls of other stations.

              <b>In</b> <b>CQ</b> <b>Mode:</b>

              • With the call input field empty, <b>Enter</b> sends the <b>F12</b> message (Auto CQ).

              • With characters in the call input field, <b>Enter</b> answers the calling station  by  sending  the  <b>F3</b>
                message (RST) and moves the cursor to the exchange field.

              • If the exchange field is empty, <b>Enter</b> repeats the <b>F3</b> message (RST).

              • After  the  exchange  information  received  from  the other station is entered, <b>Enter</b> sends the
                <b>CQ_TU_MSG</b> message if defined, or “TU” (CW mode) and your call otherwise.  Afterwards it logs the
                QSO, and returns the cursor to the call input field to answer the next call.

              <b>In</b> <b>S&amp;P</b> <b>Mode:</b>

              • When the call input field is empty, <b>Enter</b> sends  the  <b>S&amp;P_CALL_MSG</b>  if  defined,  or  your  call
                otherwise.

              • When  the  exchange  field  is  empty,  <b>Enter</b>  sends  the  <b>S&amp;P_CALL_MSG</b> if defined, or your call
                otherwise.

              • When the call input field has been filled, <b>Enter</b> sends the <b>S&amp;P_CALL_MSG</b> if defined, or your call
                otherwise.  Afterwards it moves the cursor to the exchange field.

              • Once the exchange has been received, <b>Enter</b> sends the <b>S&amp;P_TU_MSG</b> if defined, otherwise  it  sends
                your  call  followed by the <b>F3</b> message (RST).  Afterwards it logs the QSO and returns the cursor
                to the call input field to answer the next call.

       <b>Backspace</b>
              Erase the character to the left of the cursor and moves the cursor one position to the left.

       <b>Escape</b> Stop CW transmission, clears characters, returns to call  input  field,  keyboard  off  (universal
              undo).
              <b>Note</b>:  Some  changes  are  being considered to modify the behavior of <b>Escape</b> slightly.  The intent
              will be to have <b>Escape</b> only stop sending on first press and not clear any entered information.  It
              is planned that <b>Escape</b> will stop the playback of the voice keyer as well.

              As an example, characters have been entered in both the call input and exchange fields, the cursor
              is in the exchange field, and the transmission of a CW message is in progress.

              The first press of <b>Escape</b> will stop the CW transmission and clear the exchange field and  position
              the cursor to the leftmost position of the exchange field.

              The  second  press  of  <b>Escape</b> will move the cursor to the right of the last character in the call
              input field.

              The third press of <b>Escape</b> will clear the call input field.

              You can disable the above described UNDO functionality by setting <b>ESC_STOPS_TX_ONLY</b> (see below).

   <b>CT</b> <b>Compatible</b> <b>Mode</b>
       Tlf  has  limited  support  for  the  logging  sequence keys used in the once popular <b>CT</b> logging program.
       Unlike the default <u>Enter</u>  <u>Sends</u>  <u>Message</u> (<b>ESM</b>) mode, the CT Compatible mode uses the <b>Insert</b> and <b>+</b> keys in
       the logging sequence and <b>Enter</b> logs a complete QSO.  Unlike ESM mode, CT mode does not have  separate  <b>CQ</b>
       or <b>S&amp;P</b> modes.

       CT  Compatible  mode  is enabled with the <b>CTCOMPATIBLE</b> keyword in <u>logcfg.dat</u> (see the <b>PREFERENCES</b> section
       below).

       The following keys differ in behavior in CT Compatible mode.

       <b>Enter</b>  Log the complete QSO without sending any message macro.

              If the callsign field is empty, pressing  <b>Enter</b>  will  activate  the  <b>Auto-CQ</b>  function.   If  the
              exchange field is empty, pressing <b>Enter</b> in either the callsign or exchange field will result in no
              action.

       <b>Insert</b> Send the <b>RST</b> (F3) macro.

              Since  the  <b>RST</b>  macro includes the other station's callsign by default, the <b>HIS</b> macro is not sent
              first.  This differs from classic CT, but is a compromise to use the default Tlf macros.

       <b>+</b> (Plus)
              Send the <b>TU</b> macro and log the QSO.

              The <b>+</b> key checks if the exchange field is empty and if it is nothing is sent or logged.   In  rare
              cases where nothing needs to be entered in the exchange field, such as when working DX from USA in
              ARRL 160, simply enter a space to allow the <b>+</b> key to send the <b>TU</b> message and log the QSO.

       <b>Alt-V</b>  Change CW speed.

</pre><h4><b>PREFERENCES</b></h4><pre>
       Tlf  can  be  fully  configured  by  editing the <u>logcfg.dat</u> file.  Normally you keep one <u>logcfg.dat</u> file,
       setting up your callsign, the log file name, the ports and addresses for packet, the radio,  the  network
       etc., and a separate rules file per contest.

       The  <u>logcfg.dat</u>  file can be edited from within Tlf by the <b>:CFG</b> or <b>:SET</b> commands (or with any other plain
       text editor before starting Tlf).  It contains keyword-argument pairs, one per line.  Lines starting with
       “#” and empty lines are interpreted as comments and are ignored.

       You can set your favourite editor in the <u>logcfg.dat</u> file.

       The rules file is associated with the statement <b>RULES</b>=<u>contest_rules_file_name</u> in <u>logcfg.dat</u>.

       <b>Note</b>: Both <u>logcfg.dat</u> and <u>rules</u> file support the same configuration  parameters  except  <b>RULES</b>  which  is
       allowed only in <u>logcfg.dat</u>.

       Tlf  will first look in the current working directory for a <u>logcfg.dat</u> file, and if it cannot find one it
       will look in <u>/usr/share/tlf</u> for a default one.  Make sure you edit the <u>logcfg.dat</u> file for at least  your
       callsign and your preferred system configuration.

       Parameters  requiring  a  boolean value (like <u>true</u>/<u>false</u>) can have an optional case-insensitive argument.
       Alternatively, both <u>yes</u> and <u>on</u> are treated as <u>true</u>.  Similarly instead of <u>false</u> also <u>no</u>  or  <u>off</u>  can  be
       used.  Without the argument the default assigned value is <u>yes</u>.

</pre><h4><b>logcfg.dat</b> <b>STATEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Configuration  parameters  are  set in <u>logcfg.dat</u> which is located in the working directory (where Tlf is
       started).

   <b>Tlf</b> <b>Setup</b> <b>Commands</b>
       <b>RULES</b>=<u>contest_rules_filename</u>
              Name of the rules file to load.

              It helps to name the rules file according to the contest you want to describe.  The rules file  is
              located under the <u>rules</u> directory of the working directory.

       <b>SYNCFILE</b>=<u>user:password@host/dir/syncfile</u>
              File on remote host you want to synchronize with (use <b><a href="../man1/wget.1.html">wget</a></b>(1) syntax).

       <b>CTCOMPATIBLE</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Do not use the TR-Log QSO sequence, but use <b>+</b>, <b>Insert</b> and <b>Enter</b> to log the QSO.

              The  default  mode  of  operation is the TR-Log sequence which uses <b>+</b> to switch between CQ and S&amp;P
              modes, in which <b>Enter</b> is the sole key used to call the other station, send the exchange,  and  log
              the QSO.

       <b>TLFCOLOR</b><u>n</u>=<u>FG</u>/<u>BG</u>
              Defaults:
                     <b>TLFCOLOR1</b>=<u>23</u> (Header and footer)
                     <b>TLFCOLOR2</b>=<u>67</u> (Pop up windows)
                     <b>TLFCOLOR3</b>=<u>70</u> (Log window)
                     <b>TLFCOLOR4</b>=<u>57</u> (Markers/dupe colour)
                     <b>TLFCOLOR5</b>=<u>43</u> (Input fields)
                     <b>TLFCOLOR6</b>=<u>63</u> (Window frames)

              The numbers are given in octal, FG/BG or BG/FG (some experimentation likely required).

              You  should  only  specify  these  if  you  wish  to  modify the standard colours of Tlf.  In some
              Terminals you can set a special profile for Tlf with your own colours.  Another way is  to  define
              the colours via the <u>$HOME/.Xresources</u> file for <b>XTerm</b> and <b>rxvt</b>.

              <b>Note</b>:  A  sample  <u>/usr/share/doc/tlf/Xresources</u> file has been provided that sets the colour scheme
              for <b>XTerm</b> and <b>rxvt</b> to the same colour pallet as the Linux  console.   Most  other  terminals  have
              their own way of setting the colour pallet.

       <b>RXVT</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Use <b>rxvt</b>'s colours.

       <b>EDITOR</b>=<u>nano</u> | <u>vi</u>[<u>m</u>] | <u>&lt;your_favorite_editor&gt;</u>
              Editor  used to modify the QSO log or logcfg.dat.  The command specified receives the file name as
              an argument.

              When using a GUI editor that runs in the background (such as gvim) make sure to  exit  the  editor
              before  logging  new stations.  Use the <b>:RES</b> command to rescore the log.  It is best to force such
              an editor to stay in the foreground (such as with ‘gvim -f’).

       <b>CALL</b>=<u>PA0R</u>
              The station callsign used in messages; also used to determine  the  station's  country,  zone  and
              continent.

       <b>OPERATING_MODE</b>=<u>CQ</u>|<u>S&amp;P</u>
              Set  operating  mode  for start up. Use <u>CQ</u> for "run" and <u>S&amp;P</u> for "search and pounce".  The default
              mode is <u>CQ</u>.

       <b>TIME_OFFSET</b>=<u>0</u>
              Used to shift the Tlf time with respect to the computer clock.  Normally 0.

              Range: 0–23.

       <b>TIME_MASTER</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              This node transmits the time over the network (only one master allowed!).

       <b>ADDNODE</b>=<u>Node_address</u>[<u>:Port_number</u>]
              Adds an IP address (and optionally a port number) to which we broadcast stuff.  (<b>WARNING</b>: Only add
              addresses of other nodes).

       <b>THISNODE</b>=<u>A</u>
              Node designator (default “A”).  If Tlf hears its own node ID on the network it will exit  and  ask
              you to pick another one!

              Range: A–H.

       <b>LAN_PORT</b>=<u>Portnumber</u>
              Specifies  on  which  port  number  (default  “6788”)  Tlf  is listening for broadcasts from other
              instances.

       <b>LANDEBUG</b>
              Activates the debug function for recording Tlf network traffic.

              Dumps all Tlf net traffic received on this  node  into  a  file  named  <u>debuglog</u>  in  the  working
              directory.   This log can be used as a backup log for the whole network, as it is easy to retrieve
              QSO data, cluster messages, gab messages etc. after the contest.  Some users have this enabled all
              the time.

       <b>SSBMODE</b>
              Start Tlf in SSB mode (default is CW).

       <b>RTTYMODE</b>
              Start Tlf in RTTY mode (default is CW)

       <b>GMFSK</b>=<u>$HOME/gMFSK.log</u>
              Tell <b><a href="../man1/miniterm.1.html">miniterm</a></b>(1) where to get the data.

       <b>DIGIMODEM</b>=<u>$HOME/gmfsk_autofile</u>
              Tell Tlf where to send the macros.

       <b>MARKERS</b>=<u>file_name</u>
              Generate marker file for <u>Xplanet</u>.

              <u>Xplanet</u> (a GUI program for the X Window System) will show the  last  8  DX  cluster  spots  on  an
              azimuthal map.  See the relevant Xplanet documentation.

              Use azimuthal projection and center the map on your QTH (station location).

       <b>BAND_</b><u>NN</u>=<u>bottom,cw_end,ssb_start,top</u>
              Define  band  edges.  <u>NN</u> is the band designator (wavelength), allowed values are: 160, 80, 60, 40,
              30, 20, 17, 15, 12, 10.

              All 4 comma separated parameters are mandatory and shall be specified in integer Hz units with  an
              optional <u>k</u> suffix.

              Example specification for Region 1 40 m band:

                  <b>BAND_40</b> = <u>7000k,</u> <u>7040k,</u> <u>7050k,</u> <u>7200k</u>

              Internal  default band definitions are based on a superset of all Regions.  For example, 40 m ends
              by default at 7300 kHz.  In addition to configuring the legal limits <b>BAND_</b><u>NN</u> can also be  used  to
              fine tune actual band configurations for a specific contest.

   <b>Morse</b> <b>Code</b> <b>Keyer</b> <b>Commands</b>
       <b>NETKEYER</b>
              Activates the CW keyer.

              Only  the  IP  networked  keyer  <b>cwdaemon</b>  or  any  other  program  that emulates cwdaemon such as
              <b>winkeydaemon</b> is supported.  You may also need the keyer for PTT control or band info output.

       <b>NETKEYERPORT</b>=<u>port_number</u>
              Default port is 6789.

       <b>NETKEYERHOST</b>=<u>host_address</u>
              Default host is 127.0.0.1 (localhost).

       <b>HAMLIB_KEYER</b>
              Activate CW keying via Hamlib.

              <b>Note:</b> The + and - macros to control speed from within messages are not yet supported.

       <b>MFJ1278_KEYER</b>=<u>serial_port</u>
              Activates support for the MFJ-1278B multi-mode controller.

              The MFJ-1278 supports CW as well as RTTY contesting.  The serial port rate is fixed at 9600 bps.

       <b>CWSPEED</b>=<u>speed_in_WPM</u>
              Set the initial CW (Morse Code) speed.

              Can be changed with <b>PgUp</b> (increase), or <b>PgDn</b> (decrease) while sending CW messages or logging.

              Range: 4–69.

       <b>WEIGHT</b>=<u>weight_ratio</u>
              Set the CW (Morse Code) dot to dash ratio.

       <b>TXDELAY</b>=<u>PTT_delay_in_mS</u>
              Delay activation of the Push To Talk pin.

              Range: 0–50.

       <b>KEYER_BACKSPACE</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Support backspace key in keyer window.

   <b>Sound</b> <b>Commands</b>
       <b>SOUNDCARD</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Use soundcard for CW sidetone output.

       <b>SIDETONE_VOLUME</b>=<u>soundcard_volume</u>
              Set soundcard sidetone volume (default is <u>70</u>).

              A value of <u>0</u> turns off sidetone output (even for the console speaker).

              Range: 0–99.

       <b>CQDELAY</b>=<u>Auto_cq</u>
              Set automatic CQ pause delay in 1/2 seconds increments between message transmissions.

              Range: 3–60.

       <b>CWTONE</b>=<u>sidetone</u>
              Set the PC speaker or soundcard frequency.

              A value of <u>0</u> switches the sidetone off.

              Range: 0–999.

              (Due to a bug in cwdaemon it also turns  off  the  <b>Alt-T</b>  tune  function.   Use  <b>SIDETONE_VOLUME</b>=<u>0</u>
              instead).

       <b>VK_PLAY_COMMAND</b>=<u>command</u>
              The command to play a voice keyer message file.

              It default to “play_vk $1”, where “$1” will be replaced by the file name to play.

       <b>VK_RECORD_COMMAND</b>=<u>command</u>
              Command to record voice keyer messages.

              “rec -r 8000 $1 -q” is used by default. Again “$1” stands for the file to write during recording.

       <b>SOUNDLOG_PLAY_COMMAND</b>=<u>command</u>
              Playback command for soundlog recordings (default is “play -q $1 2&gt; /dev/null”):

       <b>SOUNDLOG_RECORD_COMMAND</b>=<u>command</u>
              Command to record contest audio stream. Runs out of the SOUNDLOG_DIRECTORY.

              The script “soundlog” which is part of TLF is used by default. See :Sound for details.

       <b>SOUNDLOG_DIRECTORY</b>=<u>directory</u>
              The directory in which recorded contest sound files are stored (default “./soundlogs”).

   <b>Band</b> <b>Switching</b> <b>Commands</b>
       <b>BANDOUTPUT</b>
              Outputs band information to pins 2, 7, 8, 9 on the parallel port.

              Output is 1 (160m), 2 (80m) ... 9 (10m).

              This format is compatible with the standard interface for antenna switches, band filters etc.

       <b>BANDOUTPUT</b>=<u>124181818</u>
              Output pin 2 for 160, 30, 17 and 12, pin 7 for 80, pin 8 for 40, and pin 9 for 20, 15 and 10.

              This comes in handy when you have 3 dipoles and a 3-band beam (...).

       <b>NO_BANDSWITCH_ARROWKEYS</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              This will prevent unwanted band switching when you are not using rig control.

              Band up = <b>Alt-B</b>, band down = <b>Alt-V</b> (TR-Log mode).

   <b>DX</b> <b>Cluster</b> <b>Commands</b>
       <b>TELNETHOST</b>=<u>cluster_address</u>
              Use  Telnet  to  connect  to  a  DX  Cluster  node  using  a  DNS  name  or  IP  address,  such as
              claudia.esrac.ele.tue.nl or 131.155.192.179.

       <b>TELNETPORT</b>=<u>telnet_port_of_cluster</u>
              DX Clusters often use a non-standard port for Telnet, e.g. 8000.

       <b>CLUSTERLOGIN</b>=<u>yourcall</u>
              Automatic login for the telnet client.

       <b>CLUSTER_LOG</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Write clusterlog to disk.

       <b>TNCPORT</b>=<u>serial_port</u>
              You can use <u>/dev/ttyS0</u>, <u>/dev/ttyUSB1</u>, etc. anything that looks like a tty.

       <b>TNCSPEED</b>=<u>serial_rate</u>
              Tlf supports 1200, 2400, 4800 and 9600 bps.

       <b>FIFO_INTERFACE</b>
              The FIFO (First In First Out) interface is used when you want to receive  cluster  info  from  the
              network,  or  from  another  source.   The  FIFO interface uses a special FIFO file in the working
              directory called <u>clfile</u>.  Anything you dump into  this  FIFO  will  be  displayed  by  the  packet
              interface.

   <b>Radio</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Commands</b>
       <b>RADIO_CONTROL</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Switches the radio interface on.  The rig interface makes use of the <b>Hamlib</b> library which supports
              a number of different rigs.

       <b>RIGMODEL</b>=<u>rig_number</u>
              Look at the Hamlib documentation for the rig_number.

              Hint: <b>rigctl</b> <b>-l</b> and its manual page (<b><a href="../man1/rigctl.1.html">rigctl</a></b>(1)).

       <b>RIGSPEED</b>=<u>serial_rate</u>
              Speed of the serial port for rig control.

       <b>RIGPORT</b>=<u>serial_port</u>
              You can use <u>/dev/ttyS0</u>, <u>/dev/ttyUSB1</u>, etc. anything that looks like a tty.

              For <b><a href="../man8/rigctld.8.html">rigctld</a></b>(8) set <b>RIGPORT</b>=<u>localhost</u> and <b>RIGMODEL</b>=<u>2</u>.  In this case <b>RIGSPEED</b> is ignored.

       <b>RIGCONF</b>=<u>rig_configuration_parameters</u>
              Send rig configuration parameters to Hamlib.
              e.g. <b>RIGCONF</b>=<u>civaddr=0x40,retry=3,rig_pathname=/dev/ttyS0</u>

       <b>RIT_CLEAR</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Clears the RIT after logging the qso.

              This only works if the rig, and the Hamlib routine supports it (tested on the OMNI 6+).

       <b>RIGPTT</b> Declares  that  Hamlib  CAT  PTT  capability should be checked at startup and if available used to
              activate the radio's PTT for sending voice messages instead of the <b>cwdaemon</b> PTT.

       <b>CWBANDWIDTH</b>=<u>width</u>
              Sets the CW bandwidth of your rig when changing bands.

              If unset or <u>0</u> the default bandwidth (as determined by Hamlib) is used. (a valid bandwidth for  the
              radio model must be used).

       <b>DIGI_RIG_MODE</b>=<u>mode</u>
              If  set  along with <b>RADIO_CONTROL</b> option, specifies the mode to change the radio to when <b>:DIG</b> mode
              is selected.

              <u>mode</u> may be one of “USB”, “LSB”, “RTTY”, or “RTTYR”.  If this parameter is not set, “USB” is  used
              if the FLDIGI parameter is set else “LSB” is used.

   <b>User</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>Commands</b>
       <b>CLUSTER</b>
              Show DX Cluster window at startup.

       <b>BANDMAP</b>
              Shows cluster bandmap on startup.

              Use <b>.</b>  (period) to change bandmap filtering.

       <b>BANDMAP</b>=<u>xyz[,number]</u>
              Show cluster bandmap on startup and set start values for filtering.

              &lt;<u>xyz</u>&gt; string parsed for:
                   “B” - show DX spots only on operating band
                   “M” - show DX spots only on operating mode
                   “D” - do not show dupes
                   “S” - skip dupes during grab_next (<b>Ctrl-G</b>)
                   “O” - show only new multipliers
                   “X” - show also out-of-band spots when in all-band mode
              &lt;<u>number</u>&gt; lifetime for new spots in seconds (number &gt;= <u>30</u>)

       <b>SCOREWINDOW</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Show the score window (same as <b>Alt-R</b>).

       <b>CHECKWINDOW</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Show the country/call check window.

       <b>PARTIALS</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Show a list of possible contest calls.

              See <b>CALLMASTER</b> in the <b>RULES</b> section below for partials file specification.

       <b>USEPARTIALS</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Use the auto-complete utility (takes some practice...).

              Tlf will complete the call as soon as it is unique in the database.

              This  can lead to strange effects, but in practice there are far more hits than misses.  Sometimes
              you must edit the call because it has locked on a unique call.  Try it, and switch it off when you
              don't like it.

       <b>LOGFREQUENCY</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Put frequency (kHz) into QSO number to enable logging of frequency (only in <b>QSO</b> or <b>DXPED</b> modes).

       <b>IGNOREDUPE</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Enables logging multiple QSOs in a contest with the same station (considered  a  good  idea  these
              days  as  contest bots that parse the submitted Cabrillo file will determine such dupes (duplicate
              contacts)).

       <b>SUNSPOTS</b>=<u>SSN</u>
              Set the <u>sunspots</u> <u>number</u> value which is used to do a rough calculation of the MUF  (Maximum  Usable
              Frequency).

              If the cluster interface is used the SSN will be updated by WWV or WCY messages.

       <b>SFI</b>=<u>Solar_flux_value</u>
              Set SFI used to calculate SSN.

              The  SSN  value is used to do a rough calculation of the MUF.  If the packet interface is used the
              SSN will be updated by WWV or WCY messages.

       <b>CHANGE_RST</b>
              If set in logcfg.dat, <b>PgUp</b> and <b>PgDown</b> will change sent/received RST instead of CW speed if you are
              in call/exchange field and call field is not empty.

              Default is these keys only change CW speed.

       <b>CHANGE_RST</b>=<u>33,</u> <u>43,</u> <u>47,</u> <u>499,</u> <u>...</u>
              Provide a comma separated list of RS(T) values which are used for the sent RST.

              Received RST will always be 33–39, 43–49, or 53–59.

              Providing a value for T is optional but will be ignored.

              In CW and DIGI modes T will always be 9.

       <b>NOB4</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Do not send automatic “QSO B4” message.

              Default is to send such messages.

       <b>NOAUTOCQ</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              No automatic CQ when pressing <b>Enter</b> or <b>F12</b>.

              Default is that these keys will start an automatic CQ (see their descriptions in the <b>KEYS</b>  section
              above).

       <b>ESC_STOPS_TX_ONLY</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Pressing ESC key does only stop sending CW or voice macros. No further action is taken.

       <b>SEND_DE</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Sends a “DE” word before your callsign, as in “DE W1AW”.

              There is a special case; if <b>SEND_DE</b> is present in <u>logcfg.dat</u>, and Tlf if is in <b>:DIG</b>imode, then the
              other station's callsign will be sent before “DE”, such as “DL1A DE W1AW”.

       <b>RESEND_CALL=</b><u>FULL</u> | <u>PARTIAL</u>
              Sends  the  full  or  partial  callsign again at the end of the QSO in RUN mode if the call of the
              other station was corrected.  In case of <u>FULL</u> the whole callsign will be sent again.  If the value
              is <u>PARTIAL</u>, then TLF figures out which part of callsign has to be sent. Eg.: if the received  call
              was <b>AB1CD,</b> but later it is corrected to <b>AB1CB,</b> then <b>CB</b> is sent.

       <b>SHOW_TIME</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Show last worked time instead of QSO number in the worked window.

</pre><h4><b>RULES</b></h4><pre>
       The  contest  rules can be put into separate files.  Tlf will first look for a directory called <u>rules/</u> in
       the working directory, and a file named for the contest, for example, <u>cqww</u>.  If Tlf cannot  find  such  a
       file,  it  will  look  into  the  directory <u>/usr/share/tlf/rules</u>.  A rules file contains contest specific
       parameters like multipliers, scoring rules, CW and voice keyer messages, etc.

       <b>Note</b>: The rules file overrides settings from the <u>logcfg.dat</u> file!

       <b>WARNING!</b>  It is your own responsibility to try these rules well BEFORE the contest.  The authors  of  Tlf
       cannot  possibly  check all rules for all contests :) and during the contest there is normally no time to
       fix it.  Of course, Murphy's Law always applies!  These commands can generally appear in any order.

   <b>RULES</b> <b>Configuration</b>
       General configuration options for the <b>RULES</b> file.

       <b>CONTEST</b>=<u>xxxxx</u>
              Name of the contest (same as the file name <u>contest_rules_filename</u> given  to  the  <b>RULES</b>  parameter
              referenced  above in <u>logcfg.dat</u>).  Some contests, like CQWW and WPX, are pre-programmed.  Look for
              the relevant rules file in <u>/usr/share/tlf/rules</u>.

       <b>LOGFILE</b>=<u>log_file_name</u>
              Mandatory!

              By convention <u>contest_rules_filename.log</u>, but can be anything meaningful.

       <b>CABRILLO</b>=<u>format</u>
              Specify the name of the Cabrillo QSO and QTC line format.  For most  cases  <u>UNIVERSAL</u>  is  a  good
              choice.  For further Cabrillo related information see <b>CABRILLO</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b> below.

       <b>CONTEST_MODE</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Sets Tlf into contest mode.

              Do not use this parameter for normal QSO logging!

       <b>SHORT_SERIAL</b>
              Uses short form for serial number (9=N, 0=T).

       <b>LONG_SERIAL</b>
              Uses long form for serial number (default).

       <b>LEADING_ZEROS_SERIAL</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Controls sending leading zeros in serial number. By default serial numbers are sent with (up to 2)
              leading zeros.

       <b>NO_RST</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Do  not  use RST in contest, such as for CW Open, ARRL Sweepstakes, ARRL Field Day, or various QSO
              parties and such events.

              In such a case when writing a Cabrillo log format template you must provide  a  conforming  format
              definition without RST values.

       <b>MIXED</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Stations  can  be  worked in any mode (CW, SSB and DIG) on a given band without being counted as a
              DUPE.

       <b>SSBMODE</b>
              Start Tlf in SSB mode.

              If radio control is active, the radio will be placed in SSB mode, if  not  in  SSB  mode  already.
              Normally Tlf starts in CW mode and will set the radio to CW mode if needed.

              <b>Note</b>:  At  this  time Tlf does not follow mode changes on the radio.  When switching modes use the
              <b>:CW</b>, <b>:SSB</b>, or <b>:DIG</b> commands to set both Tlf and the radio mode.

       <b>CQWW_M2</b>
              Put the node ID into the logline (just after the QSO number) to support  Multi/2  operation  where
              the  station logging the QSO must be in the Cabrillo file.  This can also be used for M/1 and M/M,
              to enable post-contest analysis of the nodes.

       <b>FKEY-HEADER</b>=<u>"short</u> <u>description</u> <u>of</u> <u>your</u> <u>defined</u> <u>F-keys"</u>
              The actual F-key assignments shown on the top of the main logging screen.  Maximum length  is  59.
              The default is: “1=CQ  2=DE  3=RST 4=73  5=HIS  6=MY  7=B4   8=AGN  9=?”

       <b>TUNE_SECONDS</b>=<u>tuning-seconds</u>
              Specify  how  many  seconds  you allow tune (Alt-T) remain active before automatically terminating
              transmit.

              Range: 1–100.

              The default value is <u>6,</u> to maintain compatibility with previous TLF versions.  After 100  seconds,
              tuning  will automatically be terminated, to allow your PA (and perhaps you too ;-) ) to cool down
              a bit...

       <b>CALLMASTER</b>=<u>callmaster</u>
              Use a different file name as the  callmaster  database  (default  is  <u>callmaster</u>  in  the  working
              directory).

              Often  downloaded  as  <u>MASTER.SCP</u>  from  the  Supercheck  Partials Web site.  See the <b>PARTIALS</b> and
              <b>USEPARTIALS</b> commands in the <b>User</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>Commands</b> section above and the <b>FILES</b> section below  for
              obtaining Supercheck Partials updates.

       <b>BMAUTOGRAB</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              If  set  along with the <b>RADIO_CONTROL</b> and <b>BANDMAP</b> (mandatory for this parameter) options, Tlf will
              grab the callsign from the bandmap, if the TRX (radio)  frequency  is  equal  with  the  displayed
              bandmap frequency.

       <b>BMAUTOADD</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              If  set  along with the <b>RADIO_CONTROL</b> and <b>BANDMAP</b> (mandatory for this parameter) options, Tlf will
              add the callsign from callsign field, if at least 3 characters have been entered.

              Use “S”kip dupes in BANDMAP settings to control if it should also grab dupes.

       <b>SPRINTMODE</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              If set, Tlf will automatically switch its mode between LOG and S&amp;P after every QSO.

       <b>FLDIGI</b> If you work RTTY (or any other digital modes), you can communicate  with  Fldigi  through  <b>XMLRPC</b>.
              This parameter activates the interface.

              By default Tlf connects to:

              <a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:7362/RPC2.

              If you run Fldigi's XMLRPC server on an different port use <b>FLDIGI</b>=<u><a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:port_#/RPC2</u>

       <b>MINITEST</b>[=<u>NNN</u>]
              Use this option when the contest is a minitest like contest.

              In  such  contests  the full contest interval is divided into shorter sections (e.g. 6 * 10 minute
              sections in an hour).  Any station can be worked  once  in  each  of  the  time  sections  without
              counting  as  a dupe.  The default length of the sections is 600 seconds (10 minutes), but you can
              pass another value (in seconds) after the ‘=’ sign.

              There must be an integral number of time sections per hour!

   <b>CW,</b> <b>Digimode</b> <b>and</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>Keyer</b> <b>Macros</b>
       The following parameters configure the CW, Digimode and voice mode keyer message macros.

       <b>Macro</b> <b>characters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>strings</b>
              <b>%</b> = my call, <b>@</b> = his call, <b>#</b> = serial number, <b>[</b> = RST, <b>+</b> = increase cw  speed,  <b>-</b>  =  decrease  cw

       <b>DKSPC</b>=<u>message</u>
              Auto Exchange call digi message in S&amp;P mode (TR-Log mode)

   <b>Scoring</b>
       The following parameters configure Tlf's scoring calculations.

       <b>ONE_POINT</b>
              One point per QSO (regardless of mode).

       <b>TWO_POINTS</b>
              Two points per QSO (regardless of mode).

       <b>THREE_POINTS</b>
              Three points per QSO (regardless of mode).

       <b>CWPOINTS</b>=<u>d</u>
              Points per CW QSO.

       <b>SSBPOINTS</b>=<u>d</u>
              Points per SSB QSO.

              <b>Note</b>: SSBPOINTS and CWPOINTS need to be set for both to work!

       <b>MY_COUNTRY_POINTS</b>=<u>d</u>
              Points for working your own DXCC entity (often zero (0)).

       <b>MY_CONTINENT_POINTS</b>=<u>d</u>
              Points for working countries in your own continent.

       <b>DX_POINTS</b>=<u>d</u>
              Points for working a station in other continents.

       <b>2EU3DX_POINTS</b>
              Deprecated.

              Use <b>MY_CONTINENT_POINTS</b> and <b>DX_POINTS</b> instead.

       <b>COUNTRY_LIST_POINTS</b>=<u>d</u>
              Points for countries in country list.

       <b>USE_COUNTRYLIST_ONLY</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Score zero points for countries not in the list.

       <b>COUNTRYLIST</b>=<u>"comma</u> <u>separated</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>prefixes"</u>
              e.g. SM,LA,OZ,OH.

       <b>COUNTRYLIST</b>=<u>file_name</u>
              File with a list of prefixes.  It can contain multiple records (lines).  The one starting with the
              current contest name is selected.  E.g. Scandinavia:SM,LA,OZ,OH.

              Not to be confused with so-called "country" files maintained by AD1C.

       <b>PORTABLE_MULT_2</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Multiply points x2 for portable stations (e.g. R1 field day).

       <b>LOWBAND_DOUBLE</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Double all points for lowband (40, 80, and 160m) QSOs (can be combined with any other value).

              (Will be deprecated in future! Use BANDWEIGHT_POINTS instead.)

       <b>POWERMULT</b>=<u>power_multiplier</u>
              Use this value to multiply the final points.

              If the contest rule allows one to use the power multiplier (such as  Stewperry,  ARRL-FD,  various
              QSO parties), set it here.

              <b>Note</b>:  The  value  type  of <b>POWERMULT</b> is a float, as in <b>POWERMULT</b>=<u>1.5</u>, but the final score will be
              rounded by the C library <b><a href="../man3/floor.3.html">floor</a></b>(3) function, which gives the largest  integer  value  that  is  not
              greater than multiplied score.

       <b>WYSIWYG_MULTIBAND</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Exchange is the multiplier, per band, whatever you enter.

              Tlf builds its own list of multipliers as QSOs are logged.

       <b>WYSIWYG_ONCE</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Exchange is multiplier, whatever you enter.

              Counts once per contest, not per band.

       <b>WAZMULT</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Multiplier is the CQ zone (per band).

       <b>ITUMULT</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Multiplier is the ITU zone (per band).

       <b>PFX_MULT</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Multiplier is prefix (PA0, DA2, VE7, etc.).

              Counts once per contest, not per band.

       <b>PFX_MULT_MULTIBAND</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Same  as WPX, but the WPX only used CQ-WW-WPX, and there a single prefix multiplier only once, not
              all band.

              With this option, the PFX counts as multiplier on all band.   This  usable  in  the  All  Asia  DX
              contest (AA-DX).

       <b>COUNTRY_MULT</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Multiplier is the DXCC entity (per band).

              Relies   on   a   so-called   "country"  file  by  AD1C.   An  outdated  version  is  supplied  in
              <u>/usr/share/tlf/cty.dat</u>.  See the <b>FILES</b> section below.

       <b>MULT_LIST</b>=<u>file_name</u>
              Name of multipliers file (often sections, provinces, states, counties).

              May contain comment lines starting with “#” in the first column.  Each  multiplier  resides  on  a
              single line by itself.

              Starting from Tlf-1.4 aliases may be defined for the multipliers.  Define the aliases as:

                  <u>multiplier:alias1,alias2,alias3</u>

              If  you log a QSO with one of the aliases it will be counted as the multiplier.  You can have more
              than one line for the same multiplier.

              This is useful for state QSO parties as an instate participant where  instate  operators  exchange
              county  abbreviations rather than the state but the state can only count once (Kansas QSO Party is
              once such example).

       <b>SECTION_MULT</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Multiplier is section from multipliers file.

              Counts per band.

       <b>SECTION_MULT_ONCE</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Multiplier is section from multipliers file.

              Counts once per contest, not per band.

       <b>CONTINENTLIST</b>=<u>"comma</u> <u>separated</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>continents"</u>
              Valid values are: SA, NA, EU, AF, AS and OC.

       <b>CONTINENT_LIST_POINTS</b>=<u>d</u>
              Points for stations from continents in CONTINENTLIST

       <b>USE_CONTINENTLIST_ONLY</b>
              Score zero points for station from continents not in the list.

       <b>BANDWEIGHT_POINTS</b>
              Define a point weighting factor for different bands.

              For example, setting:

                  <b>BANDWEIGHT_POINTS</b>=<u>160:3,80:2,40:1,20:1,15:1,10:2</u>

              for use in the All Asia DX (AADX) contest will multiply all QSO points by 3 on 160m, by 2  on  80m
              and 10m and on all other bands only by 1.

              Bands not in the list are weighted by 1.

       <b>BANDWEIGHT_MULTIS</b>
              Allow a weighting factor for multipliers on different bands.

              For example, setting:

                  <b>BANDWEIGHT_MULTIS</b>=<u>80:4,40:3,20:2,15:2,10:2</u>

              for  use in the Worked All Europe DX Contest (WAEDC) will multiply the number of multipliers on 80
              by 4, on 40 by 3 and on 20/15/10 by 2.

              The multiplication is executed after any other multiplier calculation.

              Bands not in list will be weighted by 1.

       <b>PFX_NUM_MULTIS</b>
              In WAEDC (and maybe with other contests too) the multipliers  are  the  different  countries,  but
              there are some exceptions where the prefix of certain countries is a different multiplier.

              In  WAEDC  these countries are: W, VE, VK, ZL, ZS, JA, PY, RA8/RA9 and RAØ.  With this option, you
              can define the country prefixes:

                  <b>PFX_NUM_MULTIS</b>=<u>W,VE,VK,ZL,ZS,JA,PY,UA9</u>.

              Tlf will read this list, perform a lookup in a countrylist for a country code, and that code  will
              be  used.   If  you include the UA9 prefix and then make a QSO with a station from Asiatic Russia,
              the PFX number will evaluated with a new multiplier, but European Russia will not.

       <b>EXCLUDE_MULTILIST</b>
              Some contests have a special multipliers list, which is easier to write by excluding a  predefined
              set.

              For example, the main set could be <b>COUNTRY_MULT</b>, and you need to exclude from that list just a few
              countries, (e.g. the SAC contest excludes the Scandinavian countries as they are not multipliers).
              In that case you can use this configuration:

                  <b>COUNTRY_MULT</b>
                  <b>COUNTRYLIST</b>=<u>JW,JX,LA,OF1,OF0,OJ1,OJ0,OX,OW,OZ,SM,TF</u>
                  <b>EXCLUDE_MULTILIST</b>=<u>COUNTRYLIST</u>

              Another  useful example is the WAEDC RTTY contest where all stations can work each other, however,
              for EU stations only the non-EU stations are the multipliers, and the opposite for non-EU stations
              where only the EU stations are the multipliers.  In  that  case  the  EU  stations  can  use  this
              configuration:

                  <b>CONTINENTLIST</b>=<u>EU</u>
                  <b>COUNTRY_MULT</b>
                  <b>EXCLUDE_MULTILIST</b>=<u>CONTINENTLIST</u>

              and all countries are multipliers, except for the EU stations.

              Also, in this contest the non-EU stations can use this configuration:

                  <b>CONTINENTLIST</b>=<u>SA,NA,AF,AS,OC</u>
                  <b>COUNTRY_MULT</b>
                  <b>EXCLUDE_MULTILIST</b>=<u>CONTINENTLIST</u>

              and  all  EU countries are multipliers and not those from the SA, NA, AF, OC and AS continents, so
              only the EU stations remain as multipliers.

       <b>UNIQUE_CALL_MULTI</b>=<u>ALL</u>|<u>BAND</u>
              Multiplier is the callsign.

              The argument tells Tlf, how to score the callsigns as multipliers:
              <b>ALL</b> means the callsign is a multiplier once per the contest, independent of band.
              <b>BAND</b> means the callsign counts as a multiplier per band.

       <b>GENERIC_MULT</b>=<u>NONE</u>|<u>ALL</u>|<u>BAND</u>
              Use generic multiplier determined by the contest plugin.

              The argument  specifies  the  multiplier  counting  rule  (see  above).   Default  value  is  NONE
              (disabled).

       <b>PLUGIN_CONFIG</b>
              Specifies  the  argument  to  the  contest  plugin's <b>init</b> function.  See the <b>PYTHON</b> <b>PLUGIN</b> section
              below.

   <b>Exchange</b>
       The following parameters configure Tlf's handling of the exchange.

       <b>SERIAL+SECTION</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Exchange is serial number and section, multiplier is section from multiplier file.

              Counts per band.

       <b>SERIAL_OR_SECTION</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Exchange is serial number or section.

              This option is similar to SERIAL+SECTION, except the exchange could be a serial  OR  the  section.
              This  option  was  introduced for HA-DX, where HA stations give the shortest form of their county,
              other stations give serial.

       <b>SERIAL+GRID4</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Exchange is serial number and grid (e.g. 001 JO21QI), multiplier is 4-character grid (JO21).

              Counts per band.

       <b>DX_&amp;_SECTIONS</b>
              Multiplier is DXCC country or section from multiplier file.

       <b>RECALL_MULTS</b>
              Exchange can be recycled, will  be  filled  into  exchange  field  when  it  is  known  (see  also
              <b>INITIAL_EXCHANGE</b>).

       <b>INITIAL_EXCHANGE</b>=<u>exchanges.txt</u>
              The file must contain a comma-separated list of exchanges.

              If the exchange is the name of the operator, the file should contain lines like:

                  PA0R,rein
                  PG4I,joop
                  OK1RR,martin

              If <b>RECALL_MULTS</b> is set, Tlf will look in this list for the exchange and fill it in for you.  There
              are  various  contests  which have a standard exchange, such as the FOC Marathon.  The module also
              recognises embedded calls (e.g. CT3/PA0R/QRP).

       <b>CONTINENT_EXCHANGE</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              Exchange is a continent (NA, SA, EU, AS, AF, OC).

       <b>SERIAL_EXCHANGE</b>
              Exchange is a serial number (formats received exchange and  configures  Cabrillo  exchange).   Set
              this only if <u>both</u> sent and received exchanges are plain serial numbers.

       <b>MYQRA</b>  For  the “Stewperry” contest, this option is used to set the QRA (Maidenhead) locator, (e.g. JN97,
              or the full form: JN97OM).

              In Stewperry, the points are calculated based on the distance between the stations  as  calculated
              between this setting and the locator entered into the exchange field.

   <b>QTC</b>
       The following parameters configure Tlf for the Worked All Europe DX Contest (WAEDC) exchange of QTCs.

       <b>QTC</b>=<u>direction</u>
              Send or receive QTCs in a contest (usually on WAEDC).

              <u>direction</u> is one of: RECV, SEND, BOTH

              <b>Note</b>:  Currently  just  the  RECV  direction is implemented.  For more information, please see the
              <u>/usr/share/doc/tlf/Manual.md</u> file.

       <b>QTC_CAP_CALLS</b>=<u>list_of_qtc_capable_callsigns.txt</u>
              Indicate that the station is QTC capable and highlight it in the bandmap or worked window.

              Put the callsigns of such stations in a file in the working directory, one callsign per line,  and
              give its name as an argument to this parameter.

       <b>QTC_AUTO_FILLTIME</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              If you use the QTC feature and you are an EU station in CW or SSB modes, then you can only RECEIVE
              the QTCs.

              Most  sending  stations  send  their  QTCs as a short form.  For example, after the first line the
              first two characters of time field are not sent.

              If you set this option, then when you fill the first QTC  line,  Tlf  will  fill  the  other  time
              fields,  but  only  the  first two characters.  If you change the hour (e.g. if there is a time of
              2059 and the next one is 2100), then all next time fields will be changed.

       <b>QTC_RECV_LAZY</b>[=&lt;<u>ON</u>|<u>OFF</u>&gt;]
              If you use the QTC feature, and you are an EU station in CW or SSB modes, then you  can  use  this
              feature.

              By  default,  Tlf  validates  all  received QTC lines (i.e. the time field must be four characters
              long; callsign and serial fields must not be empty).

              If you set this parameter, Tlf will not perform validation.

</pre><h4><b>CABRILLO</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       This section covers the configuration of Cabrillo processing.

       The fields of the generated Cabrillo file can be either

         • set to a fixed value,

         • input interactively,

         • or disabled.

         <b>Note</b>: A <u>template</u> file defines the values used in the headers of  the  Cabrillo  file.   A  <u>format</u>  file
         defines the fields of the QSO lines in the Cabrillo file.

   <b>Using</b> <b>a</b> <b>Cabrillo</b> <b>template</b>
       A  Cabrillo  template  is  used to provide station specific values that will be placed into the generated
       Cabrillo file.  Tlf will not prompt for values listed in this file when the <b>:WRI</b> command is issued.

       <b>Note</b>: The template keywords are the same as the parameters  below  with  the  <b>CABRILLO-</b>  prefix  omitted.
       Cabrillo  keyword  definitions can be found at the World Wide Operators Foundation Cabrillo specification
       page.

       <b>CABRILLO-TEMPLATE</b>=<u>file.cbr</u>
              The specified file is parsed and the values from relevant lines are taken the same way as if  they
              were added via a config file.

              The header, footer, comment and QSO lines are ignored.

              One  can, for example, re-use a file from a previous contest or use a sample file provided for the
              contest.  Another possibility is to summarize the station-specific values in  a  <u>station.cbr</u>  file
              (see   as   an  example  <u>/usr/share/doc/tlf/station-sample.cbr</u>).   As  multiple  <b>CABRILLO-TEMPLATE</b>
              parameters can be specified, it allows for separating the contest and station specific parts.

              This is an optional configuration as the same effect can be reached  by  plain  configs  (via  the
              <u>logcfg.dat</u> and <u>rules</u> files).

              <b>Note</b>: The <b>CABRILLO-</b> prefix is required in the config files.

   <b>Internal</b> <b>configuration</b>
       Following parameters control the generation of QSO lines.

       <b>CABRILLO-EXCHANGE</b>=<u>format</u>
              Specifies the sent exchange format.

              The  hash mark (“#”) stands for QSO serial number.  For a contest using a fixed exchange enter the
              value here (limited to 39 characters).

       <b>CABRILLO</b>=<u>format</u>
       <b>CABRILLO-QSO-FORMAT</b>=<u>format</u>
              Set the format of QSO and QTC lines including the separator character for the received exchange.

              The format descriptions are contained in <u>cabrillo.fmt</u>  either  in  the  current  directory  or  in
              <u>/usr/share/tlf</u>.   The  specified format file is used both to generate Cabrillo output and also for
              Cabrillo import.  For technical details see <u>/usr/share/doc/tlf/Manual.md</u>.

              A <u>cabrillo.fmt</u> format file is used to generate  a  Cabrillo  file  when  a  predefined  format  in
              <u>/usr/share/tlf/cabrillo.fmt</u>  does  not  exist.   For many events the <b>UNIVERSAL</b> format is adequate,
              otherwise you'll need to roll  your  own  based  on  the  log  submission  rules  of  the  contest
              organizers.

   <b>Configuring</b> <b>header</b> <b>information</b>
       Cabrillo  header  fields  can  be set using the keywords listed below.  The value assigned to the keyword
       controls the processing of the field:

         • value not in parentheses, e.g. “9ACW” taken verbatim,

         • value in parentheses, e.g. “(YES,NO)” will be asked interactively, with the provided text as hint

         • a single dash ”-“ value disables the field (neither asked nor output) keeping its value,

         • no value (i.e. a keyword without equal sign) just enables the field without changing its value.

       <b>Note</b>: The order of the headers in the Cabrillo file is fixed  and  independent  of  the  order  they  are
       present in a config or template file.

   <b>Header</b> <b>Keywords</b>
       <b>Note</b>:  These  keywords and the internal ones can also be used in a Cabrillo template just by removing the
       <u>CABRILLO-</u> prefix and using ”:“ as value separator.

</pre><h4><b>PYTHON</b> <b>PLUGIN</b></h4><pre>
       Tlf uses Python plugins to customize or extend functions beyond the built-in features.  Two  notable  use
       cases are adding a specific scoring logic and determining multipliers.

       The Python plugin file is loaded the same way as the RULES file but the file must have <u>py</u> extension.

   <b>tlf</b> <b>Python</b> <b>module</b>
       Tlf core functionality and constants can be accessed via the pre-imported <u>tlf</u> module.

       <b>Constants</b>
         <b>CWMODE</b>: <u>int</u>
         <b>SSBMODE</b>: <u>int</u>

         <b>continent</b>: <u>str</u>
         <b>timezone</b>: <u>float</u>
         <b>exact</b>: <u>bool</u>

   <b>Functions</b>
       All plugin functions are optional.

       <b>def</b> <b>init(cfg:</b> <b>str)</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>str:</b>
              Called once on Tlf start up. It shall initialize the internal state of the plugin.

              The parameter <u>cfg</u> contains the value provided to PLUGIN_CONFIG. It can  be  used  to  control  the
              internal logic of the plugin. If no PLUGIN_CONFIG is specified then an empty string is passed.

              The  return value is a string specifying the minimal required Tlf version (e.g. '1.5'). In case of
              no version dependency <u>None</u> shall be returned.

       <b>def</b> <b>setup()</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>None:</b>
              Called whenever the QSO list is initialized (e.g. on inital loading of  the  log  file  or  before
              rescoring it). It shall reset any internal structures related to QSOs.

       <b>def</b> <b>score(qso:</b> <b>Qso)</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>int:</b>
              Called before actually logging a QSO.  It shall return a non-negative score value.

       <b>def</b> <b>check_exchange(qso:</b> <b>Qso)</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>Dict[str,</b> <b>str]:</b>
              Called  when  exchange  is  received  or  updated.   From the returned dictionary these (optional)
              entries are evaluated:
                 <b>mult1_value</b>: <u>str</u>
                 <b>normalized_exchange</b>: <u>str</u>

              <b>mult1_value</b> is used as a multiplier without further conversion.  The handling of  this  multiplier
              is controlled by the GENERIC_MULT parameter.

              <b>normalized_exchange</b> replaces the received exchange in the finally logged QSO.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/usr/share/tlf/logcfg.dat</u> is a recent example of a generic configuration file.  Tlf will copy it into the
       current  working  directory if it does not find one there.  It is recommended to <b>copy</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>working</b>
       <b>directory</b> and edit it to match the contest.

       It contains, amongst other settings, the name if the rules file, your  call,  info  about  ports  for  CW
       keying,  packet  or rig control, etc. related to your station.  You should test your settings well <u>before</u>
       the contest!

       <u>/usr/share/tlf/rules/contestname</u> contains the rules of the various contests.  You can  easily  write  one
       for  your favourite contest making use of the various multiplier and points capabilities.  Test it before
       the contest and send a message to the Tlf development list if anything is wrong (or right!).

       It contains name of the log file, contest rules, points, multipliers, and other parameters related to the
       contest,

       <u>/usr/share/tlf/cty.dat</u> contains a flat ASCII database of info about countries.

       This is the same file as used by <u>CT</u> or <u>TR-Log</u>.  Updated versions from  Jim,  AD1C,  are  available  from:
       Country Files.

       Tlf  looks  for  this  file first in the current working directory, so an update is possible without root
       rights to replace the package installed version (likely well out of date).

       <u>/usr/share/tlf/callmaster</u> contains a flat ASCII database of known contest callsigns.

       Updates are available from Super Check Partial.  Save the <u>master.scp</u> file as <u>callmaster</u>  in  the  working
       directory  (or use <b>CALLMASTER</b>=<u>master.scp</u> to use the default file name).  It will take precedence over the
       system installed <u>callmaster</u> file which is likely well out of date.

       <u>Section</u> <u>files</u> contain a flat ASCII database of multipliers like states, sections,  provinces,  districts,
       names, ages, etc.  They are used by including <b>MULT_LIST</b>=<u>section_file_name</u> in the rules file.

       Some  of  these files are supplied by Tlf while others will need to be written by you.  Please offer your
       files to the developers for inclusion in the distribution or placed on the Wiki (see below).

</pre><h4><b>DOCUMENTATION</b></h4><pre>
       The documentation page at GitHub contains some more information.

       An FAQ and other useful tips are installed <u>/usr/share/doc/tlf</u>.

       The project Wiki will host various contest specific information and files.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Please send bug reports to the Tlf development list.
