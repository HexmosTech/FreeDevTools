</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       wzip - lossy data compression and denoising

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wzip</b> <u>[</u> <u>-c</u> <u>|</u> <u>-d</u> <u>|</u> <u>-dn</u> <u>|</u> <u>-hdn</u> <u>]</u> <u>num</u> <u>sf</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents the <b>wzip</b> command.

       <b>wzip</b>  is  a  program  that can be used for LOSSY data compression and denoising.  It reads from STDIN and
       writes to STDOUT. In compression mode the input is a sequence of ascii floating-point values.  <b>num</b> is the
       number of these data values. The output is a sequence of small integers, most of  them  zero  in  typical
       application.  This  is ready for effective compression with a standard loss-less compression program like
       gzip.

       The program can also be used for denoising. In this case both input and output  are  sequences  of  ascii
       floating-point values.

       The  scale  factor  <b>sf</b>  determines the strength of compression or denoising.  A higher scale factor means
       heavier compression and stronger denoising.  Four times the standard deviation of the noise content is  a
       good start.  Otherwise 5 percent of the overall signal amplitude might be used as a first estimation of a
       suitable scale factor.

       If  the  noise  content  of  the input data is strongly non-Gaussian-distributed, like Poisson noise. The
       input data should be transformed to approximate Gaussian-distributed  noise.  If  the  input  values  are
       Poisson-distributed, that means for example raw counts per channel in EDX or XPD, they can be transformed
       to    approximate    Gaussian-distributed   noise   by   transformation   of   each   data   point   with
       y:=2.0*sqrt(x+0.25109). Back transformation is done with y:=(x/2)^2. The summand 0.25109 compensates  for
       the bias caused by the asymmetry of the Poisson-distribution.

       Invoking the program without any options writes examples of the use of the program to STDERR.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There must be given exactly one option.

       <b>-c</b>     Compression,  reads  <b>num</b>  ascii floating-point values from STDIN and writes a sequence of integers
              with high redundancy to STDOUT.

       <b>-d</b>     Decompression, reads from STDIN and writes a  sequence  of  <b>num</b>  ascii  floating-point  values  to
              STDOUT. These are more or less similar to the original data.

       <b>-dn</b>    Denoising,  reads  <b>num</b>  ascii  floating-point values from STDIN and writes a sequence of <b>num</b> ascii
              floating-point values to STDOUT. These are more or less similar to the original data.

       <b>-hdn</b>   Denoising with hard thresholding instead of wavelet shrinkage. Single untouched noise peaks may be
              visible with this mode. On the other hand, there is much less impact on the signal slope.
