</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       lzma, unlzma, lzcat - LZMA compression and decompression tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lzma</b> [<b>-123456789cdefhkLqtvV</b>] [<b>-S</b> <u>suffix</u>] [<u>filenames</u> <u>...</u>]
       <b>unlzma</b> [<b>-cfhkLqtvV</b>] [<b>-S</b> <u>suffix</u>] [<u>filenames</u> <u>...</u>]
       <b>lzcat</b> [<b>-fhLqV</b>] [<u>filenames</u> <u>...</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       LZMA  (Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain-Algorithm) is an improved version of famous LZ77 compression algorithm. It
       was improved in way of maximum increasing of compression ratio, keeping high decompression speed and  low
       memory requirements for decompressing.

       <b>lzma</b>  command  line  tool  has a similar interface to <b><a href="../man1/gzip.1.html">gzip</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/bzip2.1.html">bzip2</a></b>(1) and is intended to make use of
       LZMA compression easy for the users who are already familiar with gzip and bzip2.

       In this manual <b>lzma</b> is compared mostly to bzip2 because that is currently one of  the  most  widely  used
       free  software  to  compress  tar  files  made for distribution.  Comparing lzma to gzip is not practical
       because neither lzma nor bzip2 can compete with  gzip  in  compression  speed.  On  the  other  hand  the
       compression ratio of gzip is worse than of lzma and bzip2.

       <b>lzma</b>  provides  notably better compression ratio than bzip2 especially with files having other than plain
       text content. The other advantage of <b>lzma</b> is fast decompression which is many times quicker  than  bzip2.
       The  major  disadvantage  is  that  achieving the highest compression ratios requires extensive amount of
       system resources, both CPU time and RAM. Also software to handle LZMA compressed files is  not  installed
       by default on most distributions.

       When  compressing  or  decompressing  with  <b>lzma</b>,  the new file will have the same ownership information,
       permissions and timestamps as the original file. However the this information  is  not  stored  into  the
       compressed file like gzip does.

</pre><h4><b>STREAMED</b> <b>VS.</b> <b>NON-STREAMED</b></h4><pre>
       LZMA  files  can be either streamed or non-streamed. Non-streamed files are created only when the size of
       the file being compressed is known. In practice this means that the source file must be a  regular  file.
       In  other  words,  if compressing from the standard input or from a named pipe (fifo) the compressed file
       will always be streamed.

       Both streamed and non-streamed files are compressed identically; the only differences are found from  the
       beginnings  and  ends  of  LZMA compressed files: Non-streamed files contain the uncompressed size of the
       file in the LZMA file header; streamed files have uncompressed size marked as unknown. To know  where  to
       stop  decoding,  streamed  files have a special End Of Stream marker at the end of the LZMA file. The EOS
       marker makes streamed files five or six bytes bigger than non-streamed.

       So in practice creating non-streamed files has two advantages: 1) the compressed  file  is  a  few  bytes
       smaller and 2) the uncompressed size of the file can be checked without decompressing the file.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Short options can be grouped like <b>-cd.</b>

       <b>-c</b> <b>--stdout</b> <b>--to-stdout</b>
              The  output  is  written  to  the  standard  output.  The  original files are kept unchanged. When
              compressing to the standard output there can be only one input file. This option is  implied  when
              input  is  read  from  the  standard  input  or the script is invoked as <b>lzcat</b>.  The <u>suffix</u> is not
              considered in this mode.

       <b>-d</b> <b>--decompress</b> <b>--uncompress</b>
              Force decompression regardless of the invocation name. This the default when called as  <b>unlzma</b>  or
              <b>lzcat</b>.

       <b>-f</b> <b>--force</b>
              Force compression or decompression even if source file is a symlink, target exists, or target is a
              terminal.  In  contrast  to  gzip and bzip2, if input data is not in LZMA format, --force does not
              make lzma behave like <b>cat</b>.  <b>lzma</b> never prompts if target  file  should  be  overwritten;  existing
              files are skipped or, in case of <b>--force</b>, overwritten.

       <b>-h</b> <b>--help</b>
              Show a summary of supported options and quit.

       <b>-k</b> <b>--keep</b>
              Do not delete the input files after compression or decompression.

       <b>-L</b> <b>--license</b>
              Show licensing information of <b>lzma</b>.

       <b>-q</b> <b>--quiet</b>
              Suppress all warnings. You can still check the exit status to detect if a warning had been shown.

       <b>-S</b> <b>--suffix</b> <u>.suf</u>
              Use  <u>.suf</u>  instead  of the default <b>.lzma</b>.  A null suffix forces unlzma to decompress all the given
              files regardless of the filename suffix.

       <b>-t</b> <b>--test</b>
              Check the integrity of the compressed file(s). Without <b>--verbose</b>  no  output  is  produced  if  no
              errors are found.

       <b>-v</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Show the filename and percentage reduction of each processes file.

       <b>-V</b> <b>--version</b>
              Show the version number of <b>lzma</b>.

       <b>-z</b> <b>--compress</b>
              Force compression regardless of the invocation name.

       <b>-1</b> .. <b>-9</b>
              Set the compression ratio. These options have no effect when decompressing.

       <b>--fast</b> Alias to <b>-1</b>.

       <b>--best</b> Alias to <b>-9</b>.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Exit status:
       <b>0</b> - Everything OK.
       <b>1</b> - An error occurred.
       <b>2</b> - Something worth a warning happened but no errors.

       It can be especially useful with <b><a href="../man1/tar.1.html">tar</a></b>(1) patched to support LZMA compression.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
