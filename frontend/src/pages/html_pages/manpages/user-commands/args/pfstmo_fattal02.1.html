       <b>pfstmo_fattal02</b>  [--alpha  &lt;val&gt;]  [--beta  &lt;val&gt;]  [--gamma  &lt;val&gt;] [--saturation &lt;val&gt;] [--noise &lt;val&gt;]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This command implements a tone mapping operator as described in:

       Gradient Domain High  Dynamic  Range  Compression  R.  Fattal,  D.  Lischinski,  and  M.  Werman  In  ACM
       Transactions on Graphics, <a href="../man3/31.3.html">31</a>(3), p. 249, 2002.

       With  respect  to  the  original  paper,  this  program  provides  additional  parameter which limits the
       amplification of noise. The noise is often starkly amplified because of division by zero in  one  of  the
       equations in the paper. Extension contributed by Przemyslaw Bazarnik.

       At  the core of the programme is a Poisson PDE which as suggested in the original paper is solved using a
       Full Multigrid Algorithm. However, this is an iterative solver which seems to lose accuracy when  applied
       to  higher  resolution  images  resulting  in  halo effects and surreal looking images. For that reason a
       second solver has been implemented using the discrete cosine transform as the underlying  method  and  is
       considerably  more accurate mainly because it is a direct solver. This solver is the preferred method and
       is used by default. The old multigrid solver can be selected with the --multigrid (-m) option.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --alpha &lt;val&gt;, -a &lt;val&gt;

              Set alpha parameter. This parameter is depreciated as setting a &lt;val&gt; other than 1.0 has only  the
              effect of a global gamma adjustment of the luminance channel which can be directly specified using
              the  --gamma  option.  See  the  paper  for the definition of alpha. It can be shown, although not
              mentioned in the paper, that setting alpha other than 1.0 has the same effect as setting  gamma  =
              alpha^(k*(1-beta)),  where  beta is the value as specified by --beta and k is the number of levels
              of the Gaussian Pyramid (see paper for details), which depends on the image pixel size (smallest k
              so that 2^(k+detail_level) &gt;= min(width,height)/MSIZE, MSIZE see source code, e.g. 8 or 32).

       --beta &lt;val&gt;, -b &lt;val&gt;

              Set beta parameter. &lt;val&gt; sets the strength of gradient (local contrast) modification.   Suggested
              range  is  0.8  to  0.96,  default  is  0.9  (see  paper for details).  Value of 1 does not change
              contrasts, values above 1 reverse  the  effect:  local  contrast  is  stretched  and  details  are
              attenuated.   Values  below  0.5  lead to very strong amplification of small contrast, so consider
              using --noise parameter to prevent noise.

       --gamma &lt;val&gt;, -g &lt;val&gt;

              Set luminance gamma adjustment. This can be described as a  global  contrast  enhancement  and  is
              applied  after  the  local  enhancement  as  specified by the parameter --beta is performed. Gamma
              adjustment or correction is defined by a power-law, in this case
               L_out(x,y) = L_in(x,y)^gamma, where L_in(x,y)=exp(I(x,y)) is the luminance value after the  local
              contrast  enhancement (I is the solution of the Poisson PDE). The suggested range for &lt;val&gt; is 0.6
              to 1.0, default is 0.8.

       --saturation &lt;val&gt;, -s &lt;val&gt;

              Amount of color saturation. Suggested range is 0.4 to 0.8. Default value: 0.8.

       --noise &lt;val&gt;, -n &lt;val&gt;

              Reduces the gradient amplification value for gradients close to 0 and reduces noise as  a  result.
              &lt;val&gt;  defines gradient value (luminance difference of adjacent pixels) which is treated as noise.
              Suggested range is  0.0  to  the  value  of  alpha.  Default  value  calculated  based  on  alpha:
              0.001*alpha.

       --detail-level &lt;val&gt;, -d &lt;val&gt;

              Specifies  up  to  which  detail  level  the  local  contrast  enhancement should be performed. It
              basically means that local contrast levels within small squares of  pixel  size  2^&lt;val&gt;  are  not
              changed.   In  the  implementation  this  corresponds  to  removing the &lt;val&gt; finest levels of the
              Gaussian Pyramid as described in the paper, i.e.  the  paper  only  considers  &lt;val&gt;=0.  Suggested
              values are 1, 2 or 3; 3 for high resolution images. The default is 3 for --fftsolver, and 0 if the
              original multi-level solver is used (to be consistent with the paper).

       --white-point &lt;val&gt;, -w &lt;val&gt;

              Specifies  the  percentage  of pixels which are allowed to be overexposed and therefore blown out.
              This can be useful for example when there is a very bright object in the image like  the  sun  and
              details  of  it  do not need to be resolved.  As a result the overall image will look brighter the
              greater &lt;val&gt; is.  Default is 0.5.

       --black-point &lt;val&gt;, -k &lt;val&gt;

              Same as --white-point but for under-exposed pixels. Default is 0.1.

       --multigrid, -m

              Enable the use of the multigrid solver as suggested  by  the  original  paper.  For  accuracy  the
              default fft solver is generally recommended especially when using high resolution images. The user
              will  benefit  by  obtaining photo-realistic rather than surreal looking images. The fft solver is
              also faster despite the fact it is only O(n*log n) with n=width*height, as compared  to  O(n)  for
              the  multigrid  solver.  The speed improvement is thanks to the very efficient fftw3 library which
              is used to calculate the discrete cosine transform.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       For  stronger  local contrast enhancements (beta&lt;0.9) the fft solver (--fftsolver) might produce slightly
       dark image corners.  This can be mitigated using bigger values for the --noise parameter.

       With a value of --detail-level greater than 0, the  internal  implementation  could  be  made  much  more
       efficient as only a reduced sized PDE would need to be solved, greatly improving speed.
