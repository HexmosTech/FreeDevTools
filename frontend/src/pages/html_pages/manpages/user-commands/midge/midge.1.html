       In the following, &lt;name&gt; is a required parameter and [name] is an optional parameter.

       Notes.

       The format of a note is: [<b>/options/</b>]&lt;<b>name</b>&gt;[<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>][<b>octave</b>]

       The <b>/options/</b> section can contain the following:

       <b>l</b>[numerator:]&lt;denominator&gt;

       Sets the length of the note to (<b>numerator</b> or one) divided by <b>denominator</b>. ie. l4 =  quarter  note,  l1  =
       whole  note, l3:4 = 3/4 note (3 quarter notes tied).  An uppercase `<b>L</b>' may be used instead to distinguish
       it from a `1'.

       <b>r</b>&lt;number&gt;

       Sets the number of times to repeat the note. For example

       /<b>l</b>8<b>r</b>16/

       makes the note duration 1/8 and repeats the note 16 times.

       <b>a</b>&lt;number&gt;

       Sets the note's note on velocity (attack)

       <b>d</b>&lt;number&gt;

       Sets the note's note off velocity (decay)

       <b>z</b>[+|-]&lt;number&gt;[%]

       Offsets the note by <b>number</b> midi clicks. Positive values play the note late and negative  values  play  it
       early.  If  <b>number</b> is followed by a `<b>%</b>´ character it is taken as a percentage of the current note length.
       Offset values are <b>not</b> inherited by subsequent notes.

       <b>Z</b>[+|-]&lt;number&gt;[%]

       As the above `<b>z</b>´ option but a random value is  used.  If  <b>number</b>  is  negative  or  positive  (plus  sign
       <b>required</b>),  a  value between zero and <b>number</b> is used. If there is no sign, a value between plus and minus
       <b>number</b> is used.

       The offset option will not work with the <b>r</b>epeat note option, but the same effect can be achieved using  a
       <b>%repeat</b> block.

       Notes  cannot  be  offset  backwards (ie played early) unless they are preceded by a rest. To work around
       this I have added the <b>$shorten</b> keyword, described below. See also <b>$unquantise</b>.

       <b>name</b> is the name of the note ie. [a-g] <b>required</b>.

       <b>+</b> sharp.

       <b>-</b> flat.

       <b>octave</b> is the midi octave ie. [1-11]. Although most midi software uses 0 for the lowest  octave,  I  have
       used 1 for consistency with the midi channels and instrument names which both count from 1.

       If not specified, the length, octave, attack and decay are inherited from the previous note.

       In  a  drum  track,  instead  of the note names, aliases can be used. For example, to get an open hi hat,
       instead of `<b>f+3</b>' you can use `<b>hh_o</b>'. See README.drums for a full list of aliases.

       Rests.

       Rests are written as note `<b>r</b>', with <b>/options/</b> the same as for notes, but with only the length and  repeat
       options used. The length value is inherited from note to rest and vice versa.

       Bars.

       The  pipe symbol (`|') can be used to denote bars. The lengths of bars are not checked -- this is only to
       allow more readable source files. Bars can be numbered by appending a number to the pipe symbol. They may
       be separated by an underscore but not by spaces.

       Simple bar example: | c d e f | g a b c

       Numbered bar examples: |1 c d e f |2 g a b c

       |_1 c d e f |_2 g a b c

       The consistency of bars can be checked by using the <b>$bar_strict</b> keyword in the <b>@head</b> section. This  gives
       an  error  or warning unless all tracks have the same number of bars and numbered bars appear at the same
       time in each track:

       $bar_strict <b>warn</b>  # Print a warning message for inconsistent bars.

       $bar_strict <b>error</b>  # Exit with an error message for inconsistent bars.

       Top level keywords.

       <b>@head</b> { content }

       There must be exactly one <b>@head</b> section. See below for description of <b>content</b>.

       <b>@body</b> { content }

       There must be exactly one <b>@body</b> section. See below for description of <b>content</b>.

       Keywords in the <b>@head</b> section.

       <b>$time_sig</b> &lt;a/b&gt;

       The <b>b</b> value must be one of 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.

       <b>$tempo</b> &lt;t&gt;

       <b>t</b> is the tempo in BPM.

       Both <b>$time_sig</b> and <b>$tempo</b> are also allowed within an @channel block (described below).

       <b>$title</b> &lt;title&gt;

       Sets the title of the song to <b>title</b>. If <b>title</b> contains spaces it must be inside double quotes.

       <b>$resolution</b> &lt;n&gt;

       Sets the number of midi clicks per quarter note to <b>n</b>. The default is 96.

       Keywords in the <b>@body</b> section.

       <b>%define</b> &lt;name&gt; { notes }

       Define a sequence of <b>notes</b>, assigning it to <b>name</b> to be recalled in a music track. Defined  sequences  are
       used by including:

       <b>~</b>&lt;name&gt;[/transpose/]

       within  a  track  to  include  the  sequence  <b>name</b>, transposed by <b>transpose</b> semitones. Previously defined
       sequences can be used in subsequent <b>%define</b> blocks. for instance:

       <b>%define</b> a_riff { a3 a c4 d }

       <b>%define</b> d_riff { d4 d f g }

       <b>%define</b> main_riff { <b>~</b>a_riff <b>~</b>d_riff }

       Although we could achieve the same result by transposing the first riff to make the second:

       <b>%define</b> a_riff { a3 a c4 d }

       <b>%define</b> main_riff { <b>~</b>a_riff <b>~</b>a_riff<b>/5/</b> }

       <b>define</b> blocks may also contain repeat blocks, bend blocks and $volume/patch/reverb etc.

       <b>@channel</b> &lt;number&gt; [name] { content }

       Begin a midi track on channel <b>number</b>, optionally setting the instrument name to <b>name</b>.  If  <b>name</b>  contains
       spaces it must be inside double quotes.

       <b>content</b> can include notes, rests, previously defined sequences, and the following keywords:

       <b>$time_sig</b> &lt;a/b&gt;

       Changes  the  time signature for the song (affects all tracks).  The <b>b</b> value must be one of 4, 8, 16, 32,
       64.

       <b>$tempo</b> &lt;t&gt;

       Changes the song tempo (affects all tracks). <b>t</b> is in BPM.

       <b>$patch</b> [[bank_LSB,]bank_MSB,]&lt;number|name&gt;

       Set patch number for this channel to <b>number</b> or <b>name</b>. Where <b>number</b> is from 1 to 128 and <b>name</b> is  an  alias
       as defined in README.patches.  Optionally select bank number <b>bank_MSB</b>.  Optionally select bank LSB number
       <b>bank_LSB</b> (used for external midi keyboards).  Each value must be in the range 1-128.

       <b>$bank</b> [LSB,]&lt;MSB&gt;

       Select bank number <b>MSB</b>. Optionally setting the LSB value (used for external midi keyboards) to <b>LSB</b>.  Both
       values must be in the range 1-128.

       <b>$length</b> [n:]&lt;d&gt;

       Set default note length. The value is specified in the same format as in the note options.

       <b>$shorten</b> &lt;number&gt;

       Shorten each note by <b>number</b> midi clicks, to allow space for notes to be offset backwards.

       <b>$unquantise</b> [+|-]&lt;number&gt;[%]

       Apply a random offset to each note. <b>number</b> has the same meaning as for the <b>Z</b> note option above.

       <b>$octave</b> &lt;number&gt;

       Set default octave to <b>number</b>

       <b>$volume</b> &lt;number&gt;

       Set the track volume to <b>number</b>

       <b>$attack</b> &lt;number&gt;

       Set the note's attack to <b>number</b>

       <b>$decay</b> &lt;number&gt;

       Set the note's decay to <b>number</b>

       <b>$reverb</b> &lt;number&gt;

       Set the reverb depth to <b>number</b> on the current channel.

       <b>$chorus</b> &lt;number&gt;

       Set the chorus depth to <b>number</b> on the current channel.

       <b>$pan</b> &lt;number&gt;

       Set the pan value to <b>number</b>. 0 is left 127 is right.

       The volume, attack, decay, reverb, chorus and pan values must be integers from 0 to 127. They can also be
       specified as a range (eg `<b>8-64</b>'), in which case a random value within the range is used.

       <b>%pan_all</b> { note value ... }

       Sets the pan value for each subsequent instance of <b>note</b> in the current track. This is mainly intended for
       panning  a  drum kit, but could be used on another track. <b>value</b> can be an integer or a range (eg `<b>8-64</b>').
       Multiple <b>note</b> <b>value</b> pairs are allowed. If two notes with different pan_all values are played at the  same
       time anything could happen.

       To  affect  every  note  in the channel with a range, use `<b>*</b>' or `<b>any</b>' for <b>note</b>. The <b>/r4/</b>&lt;note&gt; method of
       repeating notes will not work with this option, but the same effect can be achieved using a repeat block.

       <b>$marker</b> &lt;text&gt;

       Adds a marker event with <b>text</b> as it's content. If <b>text</b> contains spaces it must be  quoted  using  double-
       quote characters.

       <b>%repeat</b> &lt;number&gt; { notes }

       Repeat <b>notes</b> <b>number</b> times. <b>notes</b> can include notes, rests, predefined sequences and other <b>%repeat</b> blocks.

       <b>%bend</b> &lt;note&gt; { event ... }

       Play  <b>note</b>  and move the pitch wheel in the manner described by multiple <b>event</b>s, which have the following
       format:

       [n:]&lt;d&gt;&lt;+|-&gt;&lt;value&gt;

       where <b>n</b> and <b>d</b> specify the time from the start of the note or from the previous event, in the same  format
       as  the  note  lengths, and <b>value</b> is the amount to bend the note by (the plus or minus sign is required).
       With the default pitch wheel range of +/- 2 semitones a value of 32 equates to one semitone.   Note  that
       the bend amount is relative. The maximum <b>cumulative</b> bend amount is plus or minus 64.

       For example the following:

       %bend a3 { 4+32 4-32 2+0 }

       Plays  the  note a3 for 1/4 note, bends up a whole tone for 1/4 then returns down to a3 and holds for 1/2
       note.

       <b>$bend_range</b> &lt;number&gt;

       Changes the pitch wheel range to +/- <b>number</b>. This sets the maximum bend up and down, so if it is  set  to
       4,  a bend value of 64 will bend up 4 semitones and -64 will bend down 4 semitones. The default range for
       most midi devices is 2 semitones.

       <b>$pitch</b> &lt;val&gt;

       Set the pitch wheel value to <b>val</b>. This can be used in conjunction with separate  note  on  and  note  off
       events  (see below under `simultaneous notes') to create complex bending effects. Unlike the <b>%bend</b> syntax
       above, this does <b>not</b> reset the pitch wheel to the neutral position (64)

       Simpler pitch bends can be created with this syntax:

       /l8/e4<b>=&gt;</b>g4<b>=&gt;</b>e4

       This bends from e4 up to g4 and back down to e4 in linear steps over the duration of an eighth  note.  By
       default there are 16 steps per quarter note duration (8 steps in this example), but a different value can
       be set using the `-b' command line switch. Any number of notes can be used, but the first one must have a
       length value and each of them must have an octave value.

       <b>%choose</b> [time] { weighting item ... }

       where  time  is a length value in the format [n:]&lt;d&gt; the same as used in the length options, with the `l'
       omitted.

       If <b>time</b> is not specified:

       Choose one <b>item</b> from a list, where each <b>item</b> can be a note, rest, or predefined riff, and each item has a
       <b>weighting</b> which defines how likely it is to be chosen. For example:

       %choose { 2 a3 4 c5 3 e4 1 g3 }

       gives a3 a 20% chance, c5 - 40% ; e4 - 30% and g3 - 10% Each item <b>must</b> have a weighting. See also  scales
       below.

       if <b>time</b> is specified:

       Choose multiple <b>item</b>s from the list up to a length of <b>time</b>. If all the <b>item</b>s are too long to end the riff
       exactly  at  <b>time</b>, the remainder is filled with a rest. When choose is used in this way each note or rest
       must have a length value and any predefined riffs used must have a fixed length (ie the first  note  must
       have  a length value), and the length of the whole riff must be specified in the choose block in the same
       format as for notes. for example:

       %define riff_1 { /l2/a3 /l4/b c4 } # riff is 1 bar long

       %choose <b>4:1</b> { # choose 4 bars

            1 /l8/d4 3 /l8/e4 2 /l4/g4 1 <b>/l1/~riff_1</b>

       }

       If <b>time</b> is <b>0</b> or <b>-</b> then midge looks for a block of the form:

       <b>rhythm</b> { n[:d] ... }

       which is taken as a series of note length values for which the pitches are chosen from  the  list.  Other
       tokens  are passed through, so you can insert specific notes, predefined riffs or rests. Any token in the
       block  begining  with  an  underscore  will  be  passed  through,  with  the  underscore   removed.   See
       examples/tutorial/choose_scale.mg for an example.

       Another way to specify the list of notes/weightings is with the <b>scale</b> keyword:

       <b>scale</b> minor /l8/g4-6 [ weight ... ]

       This selects a G Minor scale from the 4th to 6th octaves (ie g4 to g6). The length value is unnecesary if
       you are using a rhythm block. If the <b>-6</b> is omitted a single octave is used.

       The  weight block specifies the note weightings in order.  If omitted all weightings are equal. To ingore
       a note use a weighting of 0, but there <b>must</b> be a weighting for each note if the block is present at all.

       The <b>-S</b> switch can be used to show the notes in a scale or a list of supported scales.

       <b>%chain</b> &lt;time&gt; {
           start &lt;note&gt;
           note1 [ weight note ... ]
           ...
           rhythm [ weight length ... ] <b>or</b> rhythm { length ... } }

       Define a `chain' structure where for each note there is a weighted list of notes which may follow  it.  A
       starting  point is picked randomly from all the notes used, or specified with the <b>start</b> keyword, and then
       subsequent notes are chosen from the appropriate list up to a total length of <b>time</b>.

       The <b>rhythm</b> keyword has two forms: Using square brackets `[]', a weighted list  of  note  lengths  can  be
       defined,  which  will  be chosen from randomly. Using braces `{}', a list of length values can be defined
       which will be used in sequence (repeating as neccessary).  To play through the rhythm  block  just  once,
       set  the  <b>time</b>  to <b>0</b> or <b>-</b>. In this case the rhythm block is parsed in the same way as described above for
       <b>%choose</b> with time set to zero. The keyword <b>times</b> can be used as a synonym for <b>rhythm</b>.

       The <b>start</b> keyword specifies the note to start from when using the chain. If <b>start</b> is omitted,  the  start
       note is chosen randomly.

       Another  way  define the notes in a <b>chain</b> block is to use one of the built in scales. Then the weightings
       are specified in the form of a matrix, with a row for each "from" note (one for each note of  the  scale)
       and   a   column   for   each   "to"   note.   An  example  of  this  form  can  be  found  in  the  file
       examples/tutorial/chain_scale.mg

       To use the choose or chain blocks, the file must be compiled with the  unroll-loops  option  (it  is  set
       automatically when a choose or chain block is found). This option saves the unrolled source code in a new
       file,  so if it produces particularly good output you have an exact copy which you can make other changes
       to without losing the generated track.

       Note that a choose and chain blocks cannot be inside a %define or inside another choose or chain block.

       <b>%eval</b> { Perl code }

       Run a block of Perl code and replace the %eval block with the value returned from the Perl code.

       <b>%eval</b> <b>-</b> { Perl Code }

       Run a block of Perl code without reading the return value.

       Perl code is run using the Safe module if it  is  present,  with  :base_core,  :base_math  and  :base_mem
       allowed.  If  Safe.pm is not available or more permissions are needed the --unsafe option causes midge to
       run the %eval blocks in it's own perl process.

       Keywords allowed at any point in the source.

       <b>%include</b> &lt;file&gt;

       Includes the contents of <b>file</b> as if they had been written at that point in the source file. <b>Must</b> be on  a
       line of it's own in the source file.

       Simultaneous Notes.

       The  most  flexible  way  to  play  simultaneous  notes is by using separate tracks (you can use the same
       channel/patch), or by using separate note on and note off events (see below). However, there is a simpler
       way with some limitations. For example: <b>(</b> <b>c</b> <b>e</b> <b>g</b> <b>)</b> will play the notes c, e and g simultaneously, making a
       C chord. The length of all the simultaneous notes is the same as the first one (determined  by  it's  own
       length value or the one inherited from the previous note, rest, or $length declaration.

       One way to use this to make chords is as follows:

       <b>%define</b> <b>minor</b> <b>{</b> <b>(</b> <b>c</b> <b>e-</b> <b>g</b> <b>)</b> <b>}</b> # define minor to be a c-minor

       <b>%define</b> <b>major</b> <b>{</b> <b>(</b> <b>c</b> <b>e</b> <b>g</b> <b>)</b> <b>}</b> # define major to be a c-major

       <b>%define</b> <b>7th</b> <b>{</b> <b>(</b> <b>c</b> <b>e</b> <b>g</b> <b>b-</b> <b>)</b> <b>}</b> # define 7th to be a c-7th

       Then you can use the in your music tracks:

       $length 4 $octave 4 # set default length and octave

       <b>~major</b> # play a c-major

       <b>~minor/9/</b> # play an a-minor

       <b>~7th/5/</b> # play an f-7th

       To make chords sound strummed, the <b>strum</b> keyword can be used:

       <b>$strum</b> 5

       This sets the interval between each note in subsequent chords to 5 midi clicks.

       To  create  complex patterns of simultaneous notes on one track, separate note on and note off events can
       be used. These are specified in the same way as normal notes, but with a <b>+</b> prepended for note on and a  <b>-</b>
       prepended  for  note  off. The length and repeat options cannot be used. The length of notes entered this
       way is controlled by putting rests or other notes between the note on and note off events. eg:

       <b>+</b>c4 /l4/r <b>+</b>e r <b>+</b>g /l2/r <b>-</b>c <b>-</b>e <b>-</b>g

       plays and holds c4, after a 1/4 note plays and holds e4 and after another 1/4 note plays  and  holds  g4,
       releasing all three after a further 1/2 note.

       Tuplets.

       While  it is possible to create tuplets by choosing a suitable note length, they can also be written in a
       more conventional way using the <b>%tuplet</b> keyword:

       <b>%tuplet</b> n:d { notes... }

       plays <b>n</b> notes in the space of <b>d</b>. <b>notes</b> can contain anything allowed in a @channel block. The note  values
       are then automatically altered to create the tuplet. For example:

       %tuplet 5:3 { /l8/e4 f g f e }

       plays   five   eigth   notes   in  the  space  of  three.  Tuplets  can  be  nested  to  any  depth.  See
       examples/tutorial/tuplet.mg for an example. Midge does <b>not</b> check that the  length  of  music  inside  the
       tuplet block is correct.

       Keys.

       If  you  want  to import your midi file into a notation editor you will want to set the key. This is done
       with:

       <b>$key</b> &lt;name&gt;[+|-][m]

       Where <b>name</b> is a-g, +|- are sharp and flat, and m is minor.  If the whole piece stays in the same key  you
       can  set it in the @head section, otherwise it can appear anywhere in a @channel section, and will affect
       all tracks.

       If you are used to regular music notation and want notes to be sharp or flat automatically  depending  on
       the  key, use the <b>$key_strict</b> keyword instead. To get a natural note use the <b>=</b> sign, eg in G, <b>f=</b> plays an
       f natural. The <b>$key_strict</b> keyword can only be used in the @head section.  The key can still  be  changed
       using the regular <b>$key</b> keyword.

       <b>$ctrl</b> &lt;num,val&gt;

       Set controller number <b>num</b> to <b>val</b>.

       <b>$rpn</b> [num-msb,]&lt;num-lsb,val-msb&gt;[,val-lsb]

       Set the rpn controller <b>num</b> to <b>val</b>

       <b>$nrpn</b> [num-msb,]&lt;num-lsb,val-msb&gt;[,val-lsb]

       Set the nrpn controller <b>num</b> to <b>val</b>

       <b>%verbatim</b> { byteval... }

       Insert  a  string  of  bytes  into  the  midi  file. Each <b>byteval</b> can be in either decimal (0-255) or hex
       (0x00-0xFF). The keyword <b>bytes</b> can be used instead of <b>verbatim</b>.

       <b>$print</b> &lt;text&gt;

       Print <b>text</b> to stdout. If <b>text</b> contains spaces it must be quoted using double quotes (<b>"</b>).

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       When building scales, although the pitches are correct, the note names may be technically  wrong,  eg  `a
       sharp' instead of `b flat'.

       If  there  is  an error in a %repeat or %define block the error message only gives the line number of the
       %repeat or %define keyword.

       No commercial potential.

       If you find any other bugs, please let me know.
