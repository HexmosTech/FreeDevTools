       vimdiff - edit between two and eight versions of a file with Vim and show differences

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vimdiff</b> [options] file1 file2 [file3 [file4 [file5 [file6 [file7 [file8]]]]]]

       <b>gvimdiff</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Vimdiff</b> starts <b>Vim</b> on two up to eight files.  Each file gets its own window.  The differences between the
       files  are  highlighted.   This  is a nice way to inspect changes and to move changes from one version to
       another version of the same file.

       See <a href="../man1/vim.1.html">vim</a>(1) for details about Vim itself.

       When started as <b>gvimdiff</b> the GUI will be started, if available.

       In each window the 'diff' option will be set, which causes the differences to be highlighted.
       The 'wrap' and 'scrollbind' options are set to make the text look good.
       The 'foldmethod' option is set to "diff",  which  puts  ranges  of  lines  without  changes  in  a  fold.
       'foldcolumn' is set to two to make it easy to spot the folds and open or close them.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Vertical  splits are used to align the lines, as if the "-O" argument was used.  To use horizontal splits
       instead, use the "-o" argument.

       For all other arguments see <a href="../man1/vim.1.html">vim</a>(1).

       <a href="../man1/vim.1.html">vim</a>(1)

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       Most of <b>Vim</b> was made by Bram Moolenaar, with a lot of help from others.  See ":help credits" in <b>Vim.</b>
