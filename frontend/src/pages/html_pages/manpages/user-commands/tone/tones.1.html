</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <u>tones</u> <u>-</u> <u>a</u> <u>sequential</u> <u>tone</u> <u>generator</u> <u>program</u>

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tones</b> <b>[options]</b> <b>[waveform]</b> <b>T</b> <b>freq(s)|notes(s)|command_file(s)</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>tones</u>  generates  one  or  more  tones  of  various  types  (waveforms) and duration (T millisecs) of the
       specified frequencies or notes, or mixtures of frequencies or notes. See <u>tones</u> <u>-h</u> for a list of  possible
       waveforms.  The  waveforms  should  include  <u>sine,</u>  <u>cosine</u> (90 degrees out of phase to sine), <u>square</u> (50%
       mark/space ratio), <u>sawtooth</u> (a ramp waveform), <u>triangle</u> and <u>noise.</u>  Sine  is  the  default.  Besides  the
       inbuilt waveforms, waveforms can be loaded from suitable WAV files - see below <u>LOADABLE</u> <u>WAVEFORMS.</u>

       <u>T</u> is the default number of millisecs that each tone is to be played.  Frequencies (freq(s)) are specified
       in Hertz as integers. A frequency of 0 causes T millisecs of silence to be played. Notes are specified as
       the musical note letter with an optional '#' to sharpen the note, then an octave number. Octaves run from
       C to C. Middle C is C3, the immediately preceding note is B2! The first Octave is from C0 to C1.

       Several frequencies/notes can be played at once, by specifying the frequencies/notes required joined by a
       ',' character (but no spaces!).

       e.g.   <u>1000,1500,2000</u>  specifies that the three frequencies are played together, all at the same relative
       level. See <u>AMPLITUDES</u> sections below for a  discussion  of  how  to  set  absolute  amplitude  levels  or
       differing relative amplitudes for notes played together or serially.

       Each  freq  specification can optionally contain a duration, by appending ':T', where 'T' is the duration
       in millisecs. This duration overrides the default. Also the default duration can be changed  by  using  a
       the ':T' format on it's own - not appended to a freq spec.

       e.g.  <u>1200,600:1000</u> play the two freqs for 1 sec

       e.g.  <u>c3,e3,g3</u> play the C major chord

       e.g.  <u>:250</u> set the default tone duration to 250ms

       Waveforms  can be specified/altered at anytime. A single waveform name specifies that waveform to be used
       for all channels. Alternatively a comma (',') separated list of waveforms can  be  given  to  specify  or
       alter  the  waveform  to  use for a given channel. Omitting a waveform in a list, means that the previous
       waveform is left unchanged.

       e.g.  <u>square,,triangle</u> specifies using square waves for chan 1, chan 2 is left unchanged, and  triangular
       waves are used for channel 3.

       The  digital  samples  (either  8  or  16  bits)  are played by default to the Linux <u>/dev/dsp</u> device at a
       samplerate of 22050 samples per second, in mono mode. (see <u>CONFIGURATION</u> <u>FILES</u> section below)

       Fractional Hertz frequencies are not supported. Of course, only frequencies less than half the samplerate
       (number of samples/sec) can be accurately generated; but the program doesn't check this.

       Instead of playing the output to <u>/dev/dsp</u> the samples can be written to a file as raw samples  (-o  file)
       or  written  in WAV format (-w wavfile). These data files can then be played back quickly with a raw data
       or WAV file player (e.g. wavplay) without the overhead of actually generating the samples.

       There are some special 'commands' that can be specified, that may be useful in input files.

       N      Set default tone duration to N millisecs

       @N     Set base amplitude level of tones when in absolute <u>amplitude</u> mode

       absolute
              Set absolute amplitude mode (see below)

       echo   The rest of the line of the input file, or the rest of the  command  line  parameter  (NB  to  use
              quotes where necessary) is output to stdout.

       relative
              Set relative amplitude mode (see below)

       reset|resync
              All  generator  points  are  reset  to  the  start of the waveform buffers. This forces subsequant
              generation of multiple frequencies/waveforms to be in phase.

       Further, if the word is not one of the above, then tones checks to see if a file of that name exists, and
       if it does then the file is assumed to be a file of tones commands which are executed.

       e.g.  <u>tones</u> <u>-v</u> <u>:100</u> <u>tune1</u> <u>tune2</u>     will interpret and play the tones commands in files <u>tune1</u> and  <u>tune2.</u>
       This  file  processing is recursive. Files of commands can execute other files of commands etc. As usual,
       <u>'-'</u> can be used to specify stdin.

</pre><h4><b>RELATIVE</b> <b>AMPLITUDES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>tones</u> by default works in a 'relative' amplitude mode, where  the  output  level  and  sample  range  are
       maximally maintained. This ensures the best signal accuracy.

       When  specifying  multiple  frequencies/notes  to be played together, then the relative amplitudes can be
       specified in deciBells by appending "@db" to the note.

       e.g.  <u>440,880@-12,1760@-30</u> specifies a mixture with 880Hz -12dB down, and 1760Hz -30dB down  relative  to
       the  level  of 440Hz. The mixed signal samples will span the full 16 or 8 bit range permitted for maximal
       signal accuracy.

       The dB levels indicate the relative power levels.  <u>-3dB</u> being at a relative power  level  of  0.5,  <u>-20dB</u>
       being  at  a  relative  power  level of 0.01 . However power levels are proportional to the square of the
       signal amplitude. So a signal at -6dB (quarter power) will only have  its  amplitude  down  by  half.  To
       reduce a signal amplitude by 1/10 then specify -20dB, i.e. a power level down by a factor of a hundredth.

       dB levels can be specified as decimal values.

</pre><h4><b>ABSOLUTE</b> <b>AMPLITUDES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>tones</u>  can  work in an absolute amplitude mode, where signal power levels are specified in deciBells (dB)
       relative to a 0dB level that indicates a peak value of +32767/-32768 for 16 bit signed samples, and 255/0
       for 8 bit unsigned values. Hence any signal at a positive dB level will be clipped. Signals at a negative
       dB level will attentuated.  If no level is specified then 0dB is assumed.

       e.g.  <u>500@-20,750@-6,1000,-12</u> gives 500Hz at -20db (amplitude 0.1), 750Hz at -6db  (amplitude  0.5),  and
       1000Hz  at  -12dB  (amplitude  0.25). The final mixed signal will have an amplitude of 0.1 + 0.5 + 0.25 =
       0.85 or -1.4dB.

       As can be seen, there is no "hands-free" in <u>absolute</u> mode. You have to work out the  dB  levels  yourself
       and  ensure  that  the resultant mixed signal does not go above 0dB and get clipped. Remember also that a
       sine wave at -80dB  down  (amplitude  1/10000th)  only  has  6  digital  levels  and  is  a  pretty  poor
       representation of a sine wave, not suitable for post amplification and use!

       In  <u>absolute</u>  mode  the  base  'zero'  level  can  be  altered at any time by use of the <u>@dB</u> command. All
       subsequent dB levels specified will have this base level added to them.

       e.g.  <u>@-20</u> <u>1000,1200@+6,1400@-6</u> is the same as 1000Hz at -20dB, 1200Hz at -14dB and 1400Hz at -26dB.

</pre><h4><b>LOADABLE</b> <b>WAVEFORMS</b></h4><pre>
       Given that the generation method used by <u>tones</u> to generate a waveform of FHz is  simply  to  sequentially
       select every Fth sample from a buffer containing S samples of one complete waveform at a frequency of 1Hz
       (treating the buffer as circular, the beginning conceptually joined to the end), where S is the number of
       samples per second, it is possible to load a customised waveform from a WAV file containing the S samples
       of  a  1Hz  waveform. See the <u>-load</u> <u>WavFile</u> and <u>-lw</u> <u>N</u> options below. The name of the waveform is taken as
       the basename of the WavFile, i.e. with any trailing '.suffix' and  leading  path  removed.   Each  loaded
       waveform should hence have this name unique, and different from the inbuilt waveform names.

       The  samples  in  WavFile  should  be  16  bit,  mono,  of  the  same number of samples as tones' playing
       samplerate, e.g. if tones is playing at 32000 samples per sec then the WavFile should  contain  32000  16
       bit samples. 16 bit samples are needed, because tones works internally with 16 bit samples, even if it is
       feeding  8  bit  samples  to  the sound card or output file. Ideally the samples should span one complete
       wavelength, i.e. represent 1 second of a 1Hz signal.  However this  can  be  varied  if  used  with  some
       intelligence.  If, say, 1 seconds worth of 5Hz of the waveform is used, then the output frequency will be
       5 times higher than specified. If you have a mixture  of  3Hz  and  5Hz  samples,  then  the  frequencies
       generated will be a mixture of 3 and 5 times the frequency specified. I hope that is all understandable!

       See  the  <u>tones.eg</u>  directory  for  some examples of loadable modules and how <u>tones</u> itself can be used to
       generate the loadable waveforms.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -8 | -b 8
              set 8 bit unsigned data samples

       -16 | -b 16
              set 16 bit signed little-endian data samples.

       -abs|-absolute
              set absolute amplitude mode

       -a     when used in conjunction with the -o option, data is appended to the file.

       -C file
              use "file" as the local configuration file (see below).

       -c CHANNELS
              set the maximum number of channels (concurrent played frequencies) to CHANNELS. The default number
              is 4. There is some virtue in keeping the number of channels to a minimum.

       -f     when used in conjunction with the -o or -w options, any existing file is silently overwritten.

       -h     display usage and help info

       -i file
              read frequencies/waveforms to generate from file 'file'.  Reads from standard input if filename is
              '-'. Any command line specifications are actioned before the input file is read.

       -l     play the tone sequence repetitively. Forced off if writing samples to a file with  the  -o  or  -w
              options.

       -loop N
              play the tone sequence N times.

       -o file
              write  out  samples to a raw data file. You will have to remember the data format, e.g. samplerate
              and 8/16 bit.

       -rel|-relative
              set relative amplitude mode

       -s samplerate
              set the number of samples per second to samplerate. For many simple uses a samplerate of  8000  is
              sufficient, making any saved data files smaller.

       -w wavfile
              write samples out in WAV format to wavfile. The WAV header contains details of whether the data is
              8 or 16 bits and the sampling rate. You cannot use the append (-a) option with WAV files.

       -v     be verbose

       -lw N  Specify the number of loadable waveforms allowed, the default is 4

       -load WavFile
              Load the waveform from the WavFile.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       tones 50 1000 700,1200 800,1100,1300
              generates  3 50 millisecs sine tones, the first consisting of only 1000Hz, the second of 700Hz and
              1200Hz and the third of 800Hz, 1100Hz and 1300Hz

       tones -loop square 200 700 900 400 500
              generates a sequence of 4 200 millisecs square wave tones which is repeated until the  program  is
              interrupted.

       tones -w seq.wav 70 1016 1200 1080 1150 1016
              generates  a  sequence  of  5 70 millisecs sine tones, and instead of playing them the samples are
              stored in WAV format in seq.wav which can be played by any WAV file player.

       tones -w trap.wav :1000 triangle absolute 1@6
              Generates a WAV file <u>trap.wav</u> consisting of a trapezoid waveform where the rise  and  fall  slopes
              take  up  half the wavelength. A sawtooth is generated with a maximum that has twice the amplitude
              of the maximum sample sizes allowed, hence it is clipped flat for half the waveform period  making
              a trapezoid shape.

       tones -load trap.wav :1000 triangle 1000 trap 500 triangletrap 1000500
              Will  load  the  trapezoid waveform generated above as a new waveform called <u>trap</u> and then plays 1
              seconds each of first a 1000Hz triangle  wave,  then  a  500Hz  <u>trap</u>  waveform  and  finally  both
              waveforms played together.

       See also the <u>tones.eg</u> directory in the siggen distribution.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Three  possible  configuration  files  can be used: a LOCAL config file (usually in current directory), a
       HOME config file in user's $HOME directory and a GLOBAL config file.

       All the siggen suite of programs are compiled with the names of the config files built in. By default the
       configuration files are:

       ./.siggen.conf
              is the LOCAL config file.

       $HOME/.siggen.conf
              is the HOME config file.

       /etc/siggen.conf
              is the GLOBAL config file.

       tones -h
              will indicate which config files will be searched for.

       The config files do not have to exist. If they exist and are readable  by  the  program  they  are  used,
       otherwise they are simply ignored.

       The  config  files  are  always  searched for configuration values in the order LOCAL, HOME, GLOBAL. This
       allows a scheme where the sysadmin sets up default config values in the GLOBAL config file, but allows  a
       user  to  set  some  or  all different values in their own HOME config file, and to set yet more specific
       values when run from a particular directory.

       If no configuration files exist, the program provides builtin default values, and most  of  these  values
       can be set by appropriate command line switches and flags.

       See <a href="../man5/siggen.conf.5.html">siggen.conf</a>(5) for details of the configuration files.

       <u>tones</u>   looks   for   configuration   values   CHANNELS,   DACFILE,   SAMPLERATE,   SAMPLESIZE,  VERBOSE,
       LOADABLE_WAVEFORMS.

       CHANNELS
              sets the number of channels, see '-c' option.

       DACFILE
              allows the name of the DAC/DSP/PCM device to be changed from /dev/dsp

       LOADABLE_WAVEFORMS
              specifies the allowable number of loadable waveforms

       SAMPLERATE
              sets the number of samples/sec for the DAC device

       SAMPLESIZE
              sets whether 8 or 16 bit samples to be generated

       VERBOSE
              sets whether or not to run in verbose mode.
