</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ldns-verify-zone - read a DNSSEC signed zone and verify it.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ldns-verify-zone</b> <u>ZONEFILE</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ldns-verify-zone</b> reads a DNS zone file and verifies it.

       RRSIG resource records are checked against the DNSKEY set at the zone apex.

       Each name is checked for an <a href="../man3/NSEC.3.html">NSEC</a>(3), if appropriate.

       If ZONEMD resource records are present, one of them needs to match the zone content.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>     Show usage and exit

       <b>-a</b>     Apex only, check only the zone apex

       <b>-e</b> <u>period</u>
              Signatures may not expire within this period.  Default no period is used.

       <b>-i</b> <u>period</u>
              Signatures must have been valid at least this long.  Default signatures should just be valid now.

       <b>-k</b> <u>file</u>
              A file that contains a trusted DNSKEY or DS rr.  This option may be given more than once.

              Alternatively, if <b>-k</b> is not specified, and a default trust anchor (<a href="file:/usr/share/dns/root.key">/usr/share/dns/root.key</a>) exists
              and contains a valid DNSKEY or DS record, it will be used as the trust anchor.

       <b>-p</b> <u>[0-100]</u>
              Only check this percentage of the zone.  Which names to check is determined randomly.  Defaults to
              100.

       <b>-S</b>     Chase  signature(s)  to  a known key.  The network may be accessed to validate the zone's DNSKEYs.
              (implies -k)

       <b>-t</b> <u>YYYYMMDDhhmmss</u> <u>|</u> <u>[+|-]offset</u>
              Set the validation time either by an absolute time value or as  an  offset  in  seconds  from  the
              current time.

       <b>-v</b>     Show the version and exit

       <b>-V</b> <u>number</u>
              Set the verbosity level (default 3):

               0: Be silent
               1: Print result, and any errors
               2: Same as 1 for now
               3: Print result, any errors, and the names that are
                  being checked
               4: Same as 3 for now
               5: Print the zone after it has been read, the result,
                  any errors, and the names that are being checked

       <b>-Z</b>     Requires  a valid ZONEMD RR to be present. When given once, this option will permit verifying only
              the ZONEMD RR of an unsigned zone. When given more than once, the zone needs to be validly  DNSSEC
              signed as well.

       <b>-ZZZ</b>   When  three  times a <b>-Z</b> option is given, the ZONEMD RR to be verified is considered "detached" and
              does not need to have valid signatures.

       <u>period</u>s are given in ISO 8601 duration format:
              P[n]Y[n]M[n]DT[n]H[n]M[n]S

       If no file is given standard input is read.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="file:/usr/share/dns/root.key">/usr/share/dns/root.key</a>
              The file from which trusted keys are loaded for signature chasing, when no <b>-k</b> option is given.
