       named-checkzone - zone file validity checking or converting tool

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>named-checkzone</b> checks the syntax and integrity of a zone file. It performs the same checks as <u>named</u> does
       when loading a zone. This makes <b>named-checkzone</b> useful for checking zone files  before  configuring  them
       into a name server.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b>     This option enables debugging.

       <b>-h</b>     This option prints the usage summary and exits.

       <b>-q</b>     This  option  sets  quiet  mode,  which  only  sets  an exit code to indicate successful or failed
              completion.

       <b>-v</b>     This option prints the version of the <b>named-checkzone</b> program and exits.

       <b>-j</b>     When loading a zone file, this option tells <u>named</u> to read the journal if it  exists.  The  journal
              file name is assumed to be the zone file name with the string <b>.jnl</b> appended.

       <b>-J</b> <b>filename</b>
              When loading the zone file, this option tells <u>named</u> to read the journal from the given file, if it
              exists. This implies <u>-j</u>.

       <b>-c</b> <b>class</b>
              This option specifies the class of the zone. If not specified, <b>IN</b> is assumed.

       <b>-C</b> <b>mode</b>
              This  option  controls  check mode on zone files when loading.  Possible modes are <b>check-svcb:fail</b>
              and <b>check-svcb:ignore</b>.

              <b>check-svcb:fail</b> turns on additional checks on <b>_dns</b> SVCB  records  and  <b>check-svcb:ignore</b>  disables
              these checks.  The default is <b>check-svcb:fail</b>.

       <b>-i</b> <b>mode</b>
              This  option  performs  post-load  zone  integrity  checks. Possible modes are <b>full</b> (the default),
              <b>full-sibling</b>, <b>local</b>, <b>local-sibling</b>, and <b>none</b>.

              Mode <b>full</b> checks that MX records refer  to  A  or  AAAA  records  (both  in-zone  and  out-of-zone
              hostnames). Mode <b>local</b> only checks MX records which refer to in-zone hostnames.

              Mode  <b>full</b>  checks  that  SRV  records  refer  to  A or AAAA records (both in-zone and out-of-zone
              hostnames). Mode <b>local</b> only checks SRV records which refer to in-zone hostnames.

              Mode <b>full</b> checks that delegation NS  records  refer  to  A  or  AAAA  records  (both  in-zone  and
              out-of-zone  hostnames).  It  also  checks  that  glue  address  records  in  the zone match those
              advertised by the child.  Mode <b>local</b> only checks NS records which refer to  in-zone  hostnames  or
              verifies that some required glue exists, i.e., when the name server is in a child zone.

              Modes  <b>full-sibling</b>  and  <b>local-sibling</b> disable sibling glue checks, but are otherwise the same as
              <b>full</b> and <b>local</b>, respectively.

              Mode <b>none</b> disables the checks.

       <b>-f</b> <b>format</b>
              This option specifies the format of the zone file. Possible formats are <b>text</b>  (the  default),  and
              <b>raw</b>.

       <b>-F</b> <b>format</b>
              This  option specifies the format of the output file specified. For <b>named-checkzone</b>, this does not
              have any effect unless it dumps the zone contents.

              Possible formats are <b>text</b> (the default), which is the standard textual representation of the zone,
              and <b>raw</b> and <b>raw=N</b>, which store the zone in a binary format for  rapid  loading  by  <u>named</u>.   <b>raw=N</b>
              specifies  the  format  version  of  the raw zone file: if <b>N</b> is 0, the raw file can be read by any
              version of <u>named</u>; if N is 1, the file can only be read by release 9.9.0 or higher. The default  is
              1.

       <b>-k</b> <b>mode</b>
              This option performs <b>check-names</b> checks with the specified failure mode.  Possible modes are <b>fail</b>,
              <b>warn</b> (the default), and <b>ignore</b>.

       <b>-l</b> <b>ttl</b> This  option  sets a maximum permissible TTL for the input file. Any record with a TTL higher than
              this value causes the zone to be rejected. This is similar to using  the  <b>max-zone-ttl</b>  option  in
              <u>named.conf</u>.

       <b>-L</b> <b>serial</b>
              When  compiling  a zone to <b>raw</b> format, this option sets the "source serial" value in the header to
              the specified serial number. This is expected to be used primarily for testing purposes.

       <b>-m</b> <b>mode</b>
              This option specifies whether MX records should be checked to see if they are addresses.  Possible
              modes are <b>fail</b>, <b>warn</b> (the default), and <b>ignore</b>.

       <b>-M</b> <b>mode</b>
              This  option  checks  whether  a  MX  record refers to a CNAME. Possible modes are <b>fail</b>, <b>warn</b> (the
              default), and <b>ignore</b>.

       <b>-n</b> <b>mode</b>
              This option specifies whether NS records should be checked to see if they are addresses.  Possible
              modes are <b>fail</b>, <b>warn</b> (the default), and <b>ignore</b>.

       <b>-o</b> <b>filename</b>
              This  option writes the zone output to <b>filename</b>. If <b>filename</b> is <b>-</b>, then the zone output is written
              to standard output.

       <b>-r</b> <b>mode</b>
              This option checks for records that are treated as different by DNSSEC but are semantically  equal
              in plain DNS. Possible modes are <b>fail</b>, <b>warn</b> (the default), and <b>ignore</b>.

       <b>-s</b> <b>style</b>
              This  option  specifies  the style of the dumped zone file. Possible styles are <b>full</b> (the default)
              and <b>relative</b>. The <b>full</b> format is most suitable for processing automatically by a separate  script.
              The relative format is more human-readable and is thus suitable for editing by hand. This does not
              have any effect unless it dumps the zone contents. It also does not have any meaning if the output
              format is not text.

       <b>-S</b> <b>mode</b>
              This  option  checks  whether  an SRV record refers to a CNAME. Possible modes are <b>fail</b>, <b>warn</b> (the
              default), and <b>ignore</b>.

       <b>-t</b> <b>directory</b>
              This option tells <u>named</u> to chroot to <b>directory</b>, so that <b>include</b> directives  in  the  configuration
              file are processed as if run by a similarly chrooted <u>named</u>.

       <b>-T</b> <b>mode</b>
              This  option checks whether Sender Policy Framework (SPF) records exist and issues a warning if an
              SPF-formatted TXT record is not also present. Possible modes are <b>warn</b> (the default) and <b>ignore</b>.

       <b>-w</b> <b>directory</b>
              This option instructs <u>named</u> to chdir to <b>directory</b>, so  that  relative  filenames  in  master  file
              <b>$INCLUDE</b> directives work. This is similar to the directory clause in <u>named.conf</u>.

       <b>-D</b>     This option dumps the zone file in canonical format.

       <b>-W</b> <b>mode</b>
              This  option  specifies  whether  to  check for non-terminal wildcards. Non-terminal wildcards are
              almost always the result of a failure to understand the wildcard matching  algorithm  (<u>RFC</u>  <u>4592</u>).
              Possible modes are <b>warn</b> (the default) and <b>ignore</b>.

       <b>zonename</b>
              This indicates the domain name of the zone being checked.

       <b>filename</b>
              This is the name of the zone file.
