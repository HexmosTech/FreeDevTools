</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  small  utility acts as a filter when no input file is given (reads from stdin and writes to stdout)
       or takes its inputs from that file.

       All words read are presented in a scrolling window on  the  terminal  <b>at</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>current</b>  <b>cursor</b>  <b>position</b>,
       without clearing the screen first.

       The selection cursor is initially positioned on the first selectable word by default.

       There  are  options  to  explicitly  or  implicitly  include  or  exclude  words  using  extended regular
       expressions.  Note that once certain words are explicitly excluded, they cannot be re-included later.

       Excluded words are skipped when the selection cursor is moved and cannot be searched for.

       The <b>-W</b>|<b>-ws</b>|<b>-wd</b>|<b>-word_delimiters</b>|<b>-word_separators</b> option can be used to set the characters  (or  multibyte
       sequences) which will be used to delimit the input words.  The default delimiters are: <u>SPACE</u>, <u>\t</u> and <u>\n</u>.

       The <b>-L</b>|<b>-ls</b>|<b>-ld</b>|<b>-line-delimiters</b>|<b>-line_separators</b> has a similar meaning for lines.

       Special  character  sequences  formed  by  a  <u>\</u> followed by one of the characters <u>a</u> <u>b</u> <u>t</u> <u>n</u> <u>v</u> <u>f</u> <u>r</u> and <u>\</u> are
       understood and have their traditional meanings.

       smenu strives to support UTF-8 encoding, both as input and output.  <b>UTF-8</b> sequences introduced by <u>\u</u>  and
       <u>\U</u> are also understood.

       <b>Warning</b>,  when  used  together,  it  is  important  to  know that all sequences beginning with <u>\U</u> will be
       interpreted before the beginning of the interpretation of sequences beginning with <u>\u</u>.

       <u>\u</u> can be followed by 2,4,6 or 8 hexadecimal characters  composing  an  <b>UTF-8</b>  bytestring.   Here  is  an
       example of using <u>\u</u> to compose a <b>Latin</b> <b>Small</b> <b>Letter</b> <b>E</b> <b>with</b> <b>Acute</b>: <u>\uc3a9</u>.

       <u>\U</u>  must  be  followed by exactly 6 hexadecimal digits, <b>including</b> leading zeros, that represent a Unicode
       codepoint according to ISO 10646 UCS-4.  The <b>Latin</b> <b>Small</b> <b>Letter</b> <b>E</b> <b>with</b>  <b>Acute</b>  of  the  previous  example
       (codepoint <b>U+00E9</b>) can then be represented as <u>\U0000e9</u>.

       Note that with most shells, the <u>\</u> before <u>u</u> and <u>U</u> need to be protected or escaped.

       Quotations  (single  and  double) in the input stream can be used to ignore the word separators so that a
       group of words are taken as a single entity.

       Non printable characters in words that are not delimiters are converted to their traditional form (<u>\n</u> for
       end-of-line, <u>\t</u> for tabulation...) by default.

       An invalid <b>UTF-8</b> sequence or other non-printable character will be replaced by a dot (<u>.</u>) by default.

       There is nevertheless a possibility to change this substitution character with  another  <b>ASCII</b>  printable
       one with the help of the command line option <b>-.</b>|<b>-dot</b>|<b>-invalid</b>.

       <b>Warning</b>,  <b>UTF-8</b>  encoded  codepoints  are quietly converted into the substitution character when the user
       locale is not <b>UTF-8</b> aware like <b>POSIX</b> or <b>C</b> by example.

       Words containing only spaces, entered directly or resulting from a substitution, are also rejected unless
       they are not selectable.  This allows special effects like creating blank lines for example.  These words
       are also kept in column mode, selectable or not.

       smenu has an option to define a set of characters or <b>UTF-8</b> sequences which should be ignored when reading
       words.  This can be very useful when dealing with inputs where the EOL sequence consists in more than one
       character.

       A typical example is DOS or Windows files with lines ending with <u>CRLF</u>.  In such a case one  might  decide
       to ignore all <u>CR</u> characters from the input.

   <b>Moving</b> <b>among</b> <b>words</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>keyboard</b> <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouse</b>
       <b>keyboard</b>:
         The  cursor  can  be  moved in any direction using the arrow keys of the keyboard: <b>←</b>, <b>↓</b>, <b>↑</b>, <b>→</b> or the <u>vi</u>
         direction keys: <b>h</b>, <b>j</b>, <b>k</b> and <b>l</b>.  The <b>HOME</b>, <b>END</b>, <b>PgDn</b> and <b>PgUp</b> keys can also be used when available.

         The meaning of the movement keys is as follows:
         <b>←</b>, <b>h</b>                            Previous word
         <b>CTRL</b> <b>←</b>, <b>H</b>                       Start of line
         <b>↑</b>, <b>k</b>                            Previous line
         <b>PgUp</b>, <b>K</b>                         Previous page
         <b>HOME</b>                            First word of the window
         <b>CTRL</b> <b>HOME</b>, <b>SHIFT</b> <b>HOME</b>, <b>CTRL</b> <b>K</b>   First word
         <b>&lt;</b>                               The window's content is shifted to the
                                         left while keeping the cursor visible

         <b>→</b>, <b>l</b>                            Next word
         <b>CTRL</b> <b>→</b>, <b>L</b>                       End of line
         <b>↓</b>, <b>j</b>                            Next line
         <b>PgDn</b>, <b>J</b>                         Next page
         <b>END</b>                             Last word of the window
         <b>CTRL</b> <b>END</b>, <b>SHIFT</b> <b>END</b>, <b>CTRL</b> <b>J</b>     Last word
         <b>&gt;</b>                               The window's content is shifted to the
                                         right while keeping the cursor visible

         <b>CTRL</b> <b>←</b>/<b>H</b> (resp. <b>CTRL</b> <b>→</b>/<b>L</b>) places the cursor so that a maximum number of words (selectable or  not)  are
         visible to the left (reps. right) side of the window.

         When  the  content  of the window is shifted to the left or right using <b>&lt;</b> or <b>&gt;</b> or the mouse, the cursor
         always highlights the same word and remains visible.  This can block sole shifting operations.

       <b>Mouse:</b>
         With many terminal emulators, it is possible to use the mouse to interact with the screen content.

         When the mouse is supported, the cursor can turn into an arrow (but not always) and the mouse can  then
         be used as a point and click device as follows:

         <b>First</b> <b>(usually</b> <b>left)</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>button</b> <b>(note</b> <b>that</b> <b>buttons</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>remapped)</b>:

           • A click on a word selects it if it is selectable.

           • A click on a word while holding the CTRL key pressed marks/unmarks it if it is selectable.

           • A  click  at  the  ends  of  the  scroll bar is equivalent to pressing the up and down arrow on the
             keyboard.

             A click on another location of the scroll bar moves the cursor to another  word  depending  on  the
             location clicked.  The new current word will be positioned at the beginning of a line if possible.

           • A  double-click  on  a  word  selects  it if it is selectable and acts as if the Enter key had been
             pressed, the double-click delay is configurable.

           • A click on the left or right horizontal arrow (when visible) shifts the content of  the  window  to
             the left or right, one word at a time.
             Nothing is done if the cursor is at risk to leave the window.

             Note  that  clicking  on  a left-facing arrow in an empty line means that not all the words in that
             line could be displayed because of previous shifts or moves.  In  this  case,  smenu  will  try  to
             display the last word of this line but it is not always possible as the cursor must remain visible.
             The  keyboard  commands  <b>&lt;</b>  and  <b>&gt;</b>  can be used in such a case because the cursor is already on the
             current line.

         <b>Third</b> <b>(usually</b> <b>right)</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>button</b>:

           • When tagging or pinning is enabled, a click on a word tags/untags it if it is selectable.

           • When tagging or pinning is enabled, a click on a word while holding the CTRL key  pressed  has  the
             following actions:

             - If the word clicked is selectable and no word is already marked then marks it.

             - If a word is marked and the clicked word is selectable and is not the marked word, then:

               + In  column  mode,  if  the marked word is in the same column/line as the clicked word, tags all
                 words bounded by those words in that column/line as if <b>Z</b> the keyboard command were used.

               + In line or column mode, if the marked word is in the same line as the clicked  word,  tags  all
                 words bounded by those words in that line.

               + Otherwise, tags all words bounded by the marked word and the clicked one.

               + In all cases, the mark is removed.

         <b>Mouse</b> <b>wheel</b>:

           • Rotating the mouse wheel scrolls the contents of the window one line up or down.

           • Rotating  the  mouse  wheel  while holding down the <b>CTRL</b> key scrolls the contents of the window one
             page up or down.
             This feature may not work depending on the terminal and operating system.

           Be sure to use the wheel when the mouse pointer is over the smenu window, as some terminal  emulators
           may otherwise zoom the screen in and out instead.

         Remember  that mouse support does not disable the keyboard, so use the keys instead if the mouse is not
         working properly.

         Some terminals may not report clicks after the 223rd line or column due to a limitation of the old  X11
         mouse  tracking  protocol,  one example of such a terminal emulator is screen &lt; 4.7.0.  tmux as well as
         screen &gt;= 4.7.0 are fine.

         Keyboard and mouse can be used at the same time.

         <b>Remark</b> <b>1.</b>
           Some X-Window terminal emulators may not support the enable/disable bracketed pastes escape sequence,
           in such a case if may be necessary to explicitly clear the content of the paste buffer before running
           smenu so that the mouse buttons (especially for pasting) do their job correctly.
           This action can easily be performed using the command xsel -c for example.

         <b>Remark</b> <b>2.</b>
           Some X-Windows terminal emulators intercept mouse input when  some  modifiers  are  used,  a  typical
           example is xterm which displays popup menus in these cases.
           For  xterm  (Patch  #361  -  2020/10/14  or  later)  a  working  workaround  is to use the X resource
           XTerm*omitTranslation:popup-menu either by adding it in your .Xresources file and  register  it  with
           xrdb or by launching xterm using the -xrm 'XTerm*omitTranslation:popup-menu' command line option.

         <b>Remark</b> <b>3</b> <b>for</b> <b>BSD</b> <b>systems.</b>
           In  order for the mouse to work properly under (virtualised?) FreeBSD and perhaps other BSD variants,
           it may be necessary add the following two lines to the file <b><a href="file:~/.Xmodmap">~/.Xmodmap</a></b>:

           ! Disable button 8 and 9.
           pointer = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 0 10 11 12

           And run the command: xmodmap <a href="file:~/.Xmodmap">~/.Xmodmap</a> (ignore any warnings issued by this command).

           This can also be done non-permanently by running the command:
           xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 0 10 11 12"

           If this is not enough, try to disable buttons 8 to 12.

       <b>Direct</b> <b>acess:</b>
         If <b>-N</b>|<b>-number</b>, <b>-U</b>|<b>-unnumber</b> or <b>-F</b>|<b>-en</b>|<b>-embedded_number</b> are used, then it becomes possible  to  directly
         access  a  word  by  entering  its number.  The numbering created using these option is done <b>before</b> any
         words   substitution    done    using    <b>-S</b>|<b>-subst</b>    <u>/regex/repl/opts</u>,    <b>-I</b>|<b>-si</b>|<b>-subst_included</b>    or
         <b>-E</b>|<b>-se</b>|<b>-subst_excluded</b>.

         Using  a  combination  of these options, it is easy to control which words will be numbered by adding a
         special symbol in it before using smenu and  removing  it  (substituted  by  nothing)  afterward  using
         <b>-I</b>|<b>-si</b>|<b>-subst_included</b> by example.

         <b>-E</b>|<b>-se</b>|<b>-subst_excluded</b> gives another way to do that, see below or more.

   <b>Changing</b> <b>input</b> <b>words</b>
       smenu  offers  the possibility to modify the input words in a sed-like way.  Words can be modified at two
       points: just after they have been read and after other operations have been applied,  such  as  enabling,
       disabling or coloring.

       The  related  options  are <b>-ES</b>|<b>-subst</b>, <b>-S</b>|<b>-subst</b>, <b>-I</b>|<b>-si</b>|<b>-subst_included</b> and <b>-E</b>|<b>-se</b>|<b>-subst_excluded</b> their
       descriptions can be found in the <b>OPTIONS</b> section.

   <b>Searching</b> <b>for</b> <b>words</b>
       A word can be searched using different algorithms: <u>prefix</u>, <u>substring</u> of <u>fuzzy</u>.

       <u>prefix</u> (keys <b>^</b> or <b>=</b>):
              The sequence of characters entered must match the beginning of a word.

       <u>substring</u> (keys <b>"</b> or <b>'</b>):
              The sequence of characters entered must match a substring in a word.

       <u>fuzzy</u> (keys <b>~</b> or <b>*</b>):
              All the characters in the entered sequence must appear in the same order in a word, but  need  not
              be consecutive.

              The case is also ignored.

              Note  that  spaces  and  tabs  at  the  beginning  and end of words are ignored when searching for
              substrings or fuzzy strings.

              The cursor is placed, if possible, on the first matching word having the minimum  number  of  gaps
              between  the  first and last matching character, see the difference between the actions of the <b>s</b>/<b>S</b>
              and <b>n</b>/<b>N</b> keys below.

              This method also tolerates intermediate symbols not appearing in the words which will be  ignored.
              If  this is the case, the attributes of the approximately matching words are changed into an error
              versions of them to warn the user to this situation.

              The erroneous symbols will <u>not</u> be inserted in the search buffer.

              For example: if the word <b>abcdef</b> is present in the  standard  input,  then  entering  <b>abxcdye</b>  puts
              <b>abcdef</b> in the search buffer and the word is added to the list of matching words and displayed with
              an error attribute (in red by default).

              This  special  state  will  persist  until  all  the symbols following the first erroneous one are
              deleted (using backspace) or if <b>ESC</b> is pressed to cancel the search session and clear  the  search
              buffer.

       During  a search session, the cursor changes and each character entered is added in (or removed from) the
       search buffer.  The display is refreshed after each change in this buffer.

       A 10 seconds timeout (by default) automatically ends the current search session as if the <b>Enter</b>  key  had
       been  pressed.   This  timeout  is  reset  each  time a new key is hit in search mode.  This delay can be
       configured using the <b>search</b> entry in the <b>timers</b> section of the configuration file as shown in the example
       in the configuration subsection.

       The slash key (<b>/</b>) can also be used instead of any of these keys.  By default it is is programmed to do  a
       <u>fuzzy</u>  search but this can be changed by using the command line option (<b>-/</b>|<b>-search_method</b>) or by tuning a
       configuration file, see below.

       All the words matching the current search buffer are enhanced: The  characters  present  in  the  current
       search  buffer  are  highlighted  in  one  way  and  the  other characters in another way.  Both of these
       highlighting methods are configurable.

       If the user has entered the search sequence: <b>o</b>, <b>s</b>, then the matching word "words" will  be  displayed  as
       <b>w</b><u>o</u><b>rd</b><u>s</u> when the <u>fuzzy</u> algorithm is in use depending of the display attributes configured.

       <b>ENTER</b>  and  all cursor moves terminate the search session but do not clear the list of the matching words
       and the search buffer.

       The user can then use the <b>n</b>/<b>s</b>/<b>SPACE</b> keys (forward) and the <b>N</b>/<b>S</b> keys (backward) to navigate in the list of
       matching words,

       In <u>fuzzy</u> search mode, the <b>s</b>/<b>S</b> keys attempt to move the cursor to the next/previous  word  whose  matching
       part  forms a substring of this word.  If no such matches exist, <b>s</b>/<b>S</b> and <b>n</b>/<b>N</b> do the same things.  To move
       the cursor to the next/previous fuzzy match, use the <b>n</b>/<b>N</b>/<b>SPACE</b> keys.  <b>s</b> means  next  <b>s</b>ubstring  match  in
       this context while <b>n</b> just means <b>n</b>ext match.

       If  the  user hits the <b>HOME</b> or <b>END</b> key during a search session then the list of matching words is reduced
       to the words starting (respectively) ending with the current search pattern and the window is  refreshed.
       For  those  who  consider <b>HOME</b> and <b>END</b> as non-intuitive, the <b>CTRL</b> <b>A</b> and <b>CTRL</b> <b>Z</b> keys are also available in
       search mode as an alternative.  This behavior is persistent until the user hit the <b>ESC</b> or <b>ENTER</b> key.

       For example, if the search pattern in substring mode is <b>sh</b> and the user hits <b>END</b>,  then  only  the  words
       <u>ending</u> with <b>sh</b> will be added in the searched word list and enhanced.

       Note  that  when  a  matching  word  is  selected,  its enhanced characters only show one of the multiple
       matching possibilities.

       When not in a search session <b>ESC</b> can be also used to clear the list of matching words and  to  reset  the
       search buffer.

       Note  that  the  search buffer is persistent as long as the same search algorithm is used and <b>ESC</b> has not
       been pressed.

   <b>Selection</b> <b>and</b> <b>Exit</b>
       Pressing <b>q</b> gives the possibility to exit without selecting anything.

       <b>CTRL</b> <b>C</b> (Abort) also exits the program immediately with a return code equal to  128+SINGINT  (by  default)
       without  selecting  anything.   See  the  <b>-!</b>|<b>-int</b>|<b>-int_string</b>  option  for  more  information  about  the
       customization of the <b>CTRL</b> <b>C</b> behavior.

       By default, <b>ENTER</b> or a double click with the first mouse button if applicable writes the selected word to
       stdout when not in search mode otherwise it exits from this mode and does nothing more.  If you  want  to
       be  able  to  select  a  word  <u>even</u>  when in search mode, use the <b>-r</b>|<b>-auto_validate</b> option to change this
       behavior.

   <b>Tagging</b> <b>(multiple</b> <b>selections)</b>
       When the tagging is activated by using the command line  <b>-T</b>|<b>-tm</b>|<b>-tag</b>|<b>-tag_mode</b>  or  <b>-P</b>|<b>-pm</b>|<b>-pin</b>|<b>-pin_mode</b>
       option,  then  the  keys  <b>t</b>,  <b>u</b>, <b>INS</b>, <b>DEL</b> <b>c</b>, <b>r</b>, <b>m</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>T</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>R</b> and <b>U</b>, can be used to tag/untag some words.
       These tagged words will then be sent to the standard output when <b>ENTER</b> is pressed.

       Their meanings is as follows:

       <b>t</b>      Tags/untags or Pin/unpin the word under the cursor (toggle).

       <b>u</b>      Untags or unpins the word under the cursor.

       <b>INS</b>    Tags or pins the word under the cursor.

       <b>DEL</b>    Untags or unpins the word under the cursor.

       <b>c</b>      Tags or pins all the selectable words in the current <b>column</b> when no word is marked, otherwise acts
              like <b>C</b>.

       <b>r</b>      Tags or pins all the selectable words in the current <b>row/line</b> when no word  is  marked,  otherwise
              acts like <b>R</b>.

       <b>m</b>      Marks the current word, the cursor aspect will change until the word is unmarked.

       <b>M</b> or <b>ESC</b>
              Unmarks the current word, other actions will also automatically unmark the word, see below.

       <b>T</b>      If  no  word are marked and the result of a search is still displayed then tags all words found in
              this search.

              If no word has been searched and no word is marked, then the current word is marked, just as if  <b>m</b>
              has  been  used  instead.   Otherwise  all  words between the marked word and the current word are
              tagged.
              The marked word will no longer be marked after tagging is complete.

       <b>Z</b>      Like <b>T</b> when not in search mode and when the marked words is not on the same column or line as  the
              cursor in column mode.
              When  in column mode and if the marked word is in the same column or line as the cursor, tags only
              the words in the same column (respectively line) bounded by the marked word and the cursor.

       <b>C</b>      As for <b>T</b>, <b>C</b> marks the current word if no word is currently marked, just as  if  <b>m</b>  had  been  used
              instead.
              If  a  word  is  already marked, <b>C</b> tags/pins the words between the current and the marked words if
              they are the <b>same</b> <b>column</b>.
              The marked word will no longer be marked after tagging is complete.

       <b>R</b>      As for <b>T</b>, <b>R</b> marks the current word if no word is currently marked, just as  if  <b>m</b>  has  been  used
              instead.
              If  a  word  is  already marked, <b>R</b> tags/pins the words between the current and the marked words if
              they are the <b>same</b> <b>row/line</b>.
              The marked word will no longer be marked after tagging is complete.

       Note that when you use <b>T</b>, <b>C</b> or <b>R</b> with pinning enabled, the order of word selection depends on whether the
       marked word is before or after the current word.
       When a word is marked, the pinning order using <b>c</b> and <b>r</b> increases from the  marked  word  to  the  current
       word.
       When  no  words  are marked, the pinning order when using <b>c</b> and <b>r</b> always increases from top to bottom and
       from left to right respectively.

       <b>U</b>      Untags or unpins the last tagging action.

       <b>CTRL</b> <b>T</b> Untags all the previously tagged/pinned words.
              The marked word, if any, will no longer be marked after this action.

   <b>Help</b>
       A small help message can be displayed when hitting the <b>?</b> key.  This message will last for  10s  or  until
       another key or <b>ESC</b> is pressed.

   <b>Scroll</b> <b>bar</b>
       A  scroll bar is displayed at the right of the scrolling window.  Its appearance is meant to be classical
       but it has some particularities:

       • The scroll bar is not displayed if all the input words fit on only one line.

       • Otherwise, the scroll bar is always displayed except when the <b>-q</b> option is set.  This option completely
         disables the scroll bar display.

       • When the scrolling window has only one line, the scroll bar has only 3 states:

         - <b>v</b> when on all but the last line, indicating that you can go down to see more.

         - <b>^</b> when on the last line.

         - <b>|</b> otherwise.

       • When there is more than one line to display, <b>/</b> means that the window displays the  first  line,  <b>\</b>  the
         last line.  <b>|</b> is used to fill the gap, see below the different possible configurations.
         \   \   ^   ^   \
         |   |   |   |   /
         /   v   /   v

       A  <b>+</b>  can  also appear in the scroll bar in lieu of the vertical bar, giving the relative position of the
       cursor line in the bunch of input words.

   <b>Terminal</b> <b>resizing</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>BUGS/LIMITATIONS)</b>
       The windows is redrawn if the terminal is resized.  The redrawing is actually done only 1s after the  end
       of  the  resizing  to avoid artifacts on screen.  The cursor will remain on the current selected word but
       may be displayed at another place in the window.

   <b>Unicode</b> <b>support</b>
       This utility is Unicode aware and should be able to display correctly any Unicode character (even double-
       width ones) as long as the current encoding is <b>UTF-8</b> (<b>UTF-8</b> in the output of the <u>locale</u> command).

       Note that smenu will not attempt to normalize words containing UTF-8 glyphs.  Thus  <u>\u61\ucc88</u>  (<u>ä</u>)  will
       not be considered equal to <u>\uc3a4</u> (canonical normalization of  <u>ä</u>).  It is nevertheless possible to use an
       external  tool  such as uconv from the ICU project (https://icu.unicode.org) to do this work before using
       smenu.

       For example: uconv can be used as a filter as in:

       <b>cat</b> <b>...</b> <b>|</b> <b>uconv</b> <b>-x</b> <b>any-nfc</b> <b>|</b> <b>smenu</b>

   <b>Configuration</b>
       If a file with adequate permissions and the same name as the  executable  but  prefixed  with  a  dot  is
       present  in the current directory or in the user's home directory, then it will be parsed as a <u>.ini</u> file.
       The values read from the file in the home directory will be overridden by the ones read  from  the  local
       directory (if it is present).

       Missing and bad keywords are silently skipped.

       The values read, if valid, override the default hard-coded ones.

       If a value is invalid an error message is shown and the program terminates.

       The values of the timers must be given in units of <b>1/10</b> of a second.

       Here is an example giving the syntax and the names of the keywords allowed:

       --8&lt;------------------------------------------------------------------

       • The  <b>method</b>  keyword can take the two possible values displayed above and determines if you want to use
         the native method (limited to 8 colors) of the <b>ansi</b> method (ISO 8613-6) if your terminal supports  more
         than 8 colors.

         The default value corresponds to <b>ansi</b>.

         The  attributes  syntax  is [fg][/bg][,toggles] where <b>fg</b> and <b>bg</b> are numbers representing the foreground
         and background color and <b>toggles</b> is a strings which can contain the characters <u>b</u>, <u>d</u>, <u>r</u>, <u>s</u>, <u>u</u>, <u>i</u>, <u>n</u>  and
         <u>l</u> representing respectively <u>b</u>old, <u>d</u>im, <u>r</u>everse, <u>s</u>tandout, <u>u</u>nderline, <u>i</u>talic, i<u>n</u>visible and b<u>l</u>ink.

       • Spaces are allowed anywhere in the lines and between them, even around the <b>=</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Not all options may be available, depending on the current context.

       When  smenu  is  called and before the first option is evaluated, it is in the <b>Main</b> context.  Each option
       can switch to another context in which only a subset of the options is usable.

       For each parameter described below, the contexts in which the associated option is defined as well as the
       context to which it leads, if any, are given.

       An option not defined in a context will force the end of the current  context  and  will  be  recursively
       evaluated in the previous contexts until found (or not).  If not found, an error message is displayed and
       smenu is terminated.

       The contexts defined in smenu are:

       <b>Main</b>
         The default context

       <b>Columns</b>
         After the <b>-c</b>|<b>-col</b>|<b>-col_mode</b>|<b>-column</b> parameter.

       <b>Lines</b>
         After the <b>-l</b>|<b>-line</b>|<b>-line_mode</b> parameter.

       <b>Tabulations</b>
         After the <b>-t</b>|<b>-tab</b>|<b>-tab_mode</b>|<b>-tabulate_mode</b> parameter.

       <b>Tagging</b>
         After the <b>-T</b>|<b>-tm</b>|<b>-tag</b>|<b>-tag_mode</b> or <b>-P</b>|<b>-pm</b>|<b>-pin</b>|<b>-pin_mode</b> parameter.

       <b>WARNING</b>
         Here is a situation that may seem confusing at first glance.

         Imagine the only parameter command line parameter is <b>-cols_select</b>.

         Since  this  is  a parameter of an option which is not valid when not in the <b>Columns</b> context, it should
         have raised an error but it still seems to be accepted.

         The trick is: when not in column mode <b>-cols_select</b> is indeed not accepted  but  its  prefix  (<b>-col</b>)  is
         valid.   The  options are thus understood as: <b>-col</b> <b>-s_select</b>.  The same mechanism occurs again as <b>-s</b> is
         also valid in column mode so the final understanding of the command line is: <b>-col</b> <b>-s</b> <b>_select</b>.

         Another example that illustrates the fact that long  parameters  have  priority  over  short  parameter
         combinations:  <b>-is</b>  will  not  select  only words containing a "<b>s</b>", but will act in the same way as its
         alternative name (<b>-incremental_search</b>).

         If you really want to select only words containing a "<b>s</b>", simply add a space after the <b>i</b> as in <b>-i</b> <b>s</b>  or
         use one of the other <b>-i</b> names such as <b>-inc</b> for example.

         In such cases, the user may set the <b>CTXOPT_DEBUG</b> environment variable which any non-empty content.

         If we reconsider the <b>-cols_select</b> example with <b>CTXOPT_DEBUG</b> set the output is now:

         CTXOPT_DEBUG: Parameter: -cols_select. Evaluation context: Main.
         CTXOPT_DEBUG: Found a valid parameter as a prefix of -cols_select: -col.
         CTXOPT_DEBUG: Parameter: -col. Evaluation context: Main.
         CTXOPT_DEBUG: Switch to context Columns.
         CTXOPT_DEBUG: Parameter: -s_select. Evaluation context: Columns.
         CTXOPT_DEBUG: Found a valid parameter as a prefix of -s_select: -s.
         CTXOPT_DEBUG: Parameter: -s. Evaluation context: Columns.
         CTXOPT_DEBUG: Argument: _select.

         In  this  case,  adding  a  space  in  the  command line: <b>-col</b> <b>-cols_select</b> <b>1</b> also solves the issue and
         indicates that only the first column should be selectable.

         Note, however, that at least one argument for <b>-cols_select</b> is now required:

         CTXOPT_DEBUG: Parameter: -col. Evaluation context: Main.
         CTXOPT_DEBUG: Switch to context Columns.
         CTXOPT_DEBUG: Parameter: -cols_select. Evaluation context: Columns.
         CTXOPT_DEBUG: Argument: 1.

       The <b>-h</b>|<b>-help</b> and <b>-?</b>|<b>-u</b>|<b>-usage</b> options now display the help and synopsis of the available options  in  the
       current context.

       Example:
         <b>smenu</b> <b>-col</b> <b>-u</b> will only show the usage in the <b>Columns</b> context

       The contexts contain all the non-context-changing options so, in practice, the usage should be intuitive.
       You  may  nevertheless  have to adjust some scripts using the old smenu releases as I did in the lvm_menu
       example.

       Some of the advantages of this new system of options are:

       • Long parameter names are allowed One dash is  enough,  but  two  are  also  allowed  for  compatibility
         reasons.

       • An option can be referenced by any number of parameters with short or long names.

       • Auto checking of missing mandatory options, duplicated option,...

       • Only options usable in the current context are allowed.

       This option management system is explained in more detail at https://github.com/p-gen/ctxopt.

       The description of each command line parameter is as follows:

       <b>-h</b>|<b>-help</b>
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              Display a context specific help messages and exits.

       <b>-H</b>|<b>-long_help</b>
              (Allowed in the "Main" context.)

              Display a long (non context specific) help messages and exits.

       <b>-?</b>|<b>-u</b>|<b>-usage</b>
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              Displays a short help message and exits.

       <b>-V</b>|<b>-version</b>
              (Allowed in the "Main" context.)

              The  <b>.smenu</b>  files  in the user's home directory and in the current directory, if present, will be
              ignored when this option is used.

       <b>-n</b>|<b>-lines</b>|<b>-height</b> [<u>height</u>]
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              Gives the maximum number of lines in the scrolling selection window.

              If <b>-n</b>|<b>-lines</b>|<b>-height</b> is not present the number of lines will be set to <u>5</u>.

              If <b>-n</b>|<b>-lines</b>|<b>-height</b> is present without argument, then the height of the terminal will be used  to
              determine the number of lines.  This remains true even if the terminal is resized.

              If  <b>-n</b>|<b>-lines</b>|<b>-height</b>  is  present with a numerical argument, this value will be used to determine
              the number of lines.

       <b>-i</b>|<b>-in</b>|<b>-inc</b>|<b>-incl</b>|<b>-include</b>... <u>regex</u>
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              Sets the <b>i</b>nclude filter to match the selectable words.  All the other words will become implicitly
              non-selectable (excluded)

              <b>-i</b>|<b>-in</b>|<b>-inc</b>|<b>-incl</b>|<b>-include</b> can be used more than once with cumulative effect.

              <u>\u</u> and <u>\U</u> sequences can also be used in the regexp.

       <b>-e</b>|<b>-ex</b>|<b>-exc</b>|<b>-excl</b>|<b>-exclude</b>... <u>regex</u>
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              Sets the <b>e</b>xclude filter to match the non-selectable words.  All the other  selectable  words  will
              become implicitly selectable (included)

              <b>-e</b>|<b>-ex</b>|<b>-exc</b>|<b>-excl</b>|<b>-exclude</b>  can  be used more than once with cumulative effect.  This filter has a
              higher priority than the include filter.

              The <u>regex</u> selections made using <b>-i</b>|<b>-in</b>|<b>-inc</b>|<b>-incl</b>|<b>-include</b> and/or  <b>-e</b>|<b>-ex</b>|<b>-exc</b>|<b>-excl</b>|<b>-exclude</b>  are
              done    before    the    possible    words   alterations   made   by   <b>-I</b>|<b>-si</b>|<b>-subst_included</b>   or
              <b>-E</b>|<b>-se</b>|<b>-subst_excluded</b> (see below).

              <u>\u</u> and <u>\U</u> sequences can also be used in the regexp.

       <b>-m</b>|<b>-msg</b>|<b>-message</b>|<b>-title</b> <u>message</u>
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              Displays a message (title) above the window.  If the current locale is not <b>UTF-8</b>, then  all  <b>UTF-8</b>
              characters will be replaced by the substitution character.

              <u>\u</u> and <u>\U</u> sequences can be used in the message.

              Note that the message will be truncated if it does not fit on a terminal line.

       <b>-!</b>|<b>-int</b>|<b>-int_string</b> [<u>string</u>]
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              The  optional <u>string</u> argument, when present, defines the string to be used as the selection string
              when the <b>CTRL</b> <b>C</b> sequence is entered.

              If <u>string</u> is missing then nothing will be selected.

              In all cases, when <b>-!</b>|<b>-int</b>|<b>-int_string</b> is present in the command line,  the  return  code  of  the
              program will be <b>0</b>.

              This  gives  the  user  the choice to make the behavior of <b>CTRL</b> <b>C</b> similar to that of <b>q</b> and <b>Q</b> or to
              that of the Unix shell leaving the shell with a return code greater than 128.

       <b>-a</b>|<b>-attr</b>|<b>-attributes</b> <u>prefix:attr</u>...
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              Sets the display attributes of the elements displayed and the cursor.

              At least one attribute prefixed attribute must be given.

              <u>prefix</u> can take the following values:

              <u>i</u>      included words.

              <u>e</u>      excluded words.

              <u>c</u>      cursor.

              <u>b</u>      scroll bar.

              <u>s</u>      shift indicator.

              <u>m</u>      message (title).

              <u>t</u>      tagged words.

              <u>ct</u>     cursor on tagged words.

              <u>sf</u>     search field.

              <u>st</u>     search text.

              <u>sfe</u>    approximate search field with error.

              <u>ste</u>    approximate search text with error.

              <u>mf</u>     matching words field.

              <u>mt</u>     matching words text.

              <u>mfe</u>    matching words field with error.

              <u>mte</u>    matching words text with error.

              <u>da</u>     direct access tag.

              If more than one attribute is given, they must be separated by spaces.

              Example: <b>-attr</b> <b>i:/5</b> <b>e:4,br</b> <b>b:7/3,rb</b> <b>c:7/2,b</b>

              See the the <b>-1</b>|<b>-l1</b>|<b>-level1</b> option below for the description of the  attributes  syntax  after  the
              colon and an example.

       <b>-1</b>|<b>-l1</b>|<b>-level1</b> <u>regex</u> [<u>attr</u>]

       <b>-2</b>|<b>-l2</b>|<b>-level2</b> <u>regex</u> [<u>attr</u>]

       <b>-3</b>|<b>-l3</b>|<b>-level3</b> <u>regex</u> [<u>attr</u>]

       <b>-4</b>|<b>-l4</b>|<b>-level4</b> <u>regex</u> [<u>attr</u>]

       <b>-5</b>|<b>-l5</b>|<b>-level5</b> <u>regex</u> [<u>attr</u>]

       <b>-6</b>|<b>-l6</b>|<b>-level6</b> <u>regex</u> [<u>attr</u>]

       <b>-7</b>|<b>-l7</b>|<b>-level7</b> <u>regex</u> [<u>attr</u>]

       <b>-8</b>|<b>-l8</b>|<b>-level8</b> <u>regex</u> [<u>attr</u>]

       <b>-9</b>|<b>-l9</b>|<b>-level9</b> <u>regex</u> [<u>attr</u>]
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              Allows  one  to  give  a  special  display  color to up to 5 classes of words specified by regular
              expressions.  They are called <b>special</b> <b>levels</b>.  Only selectable words will be considered.

              By default,  the  first  5  special  levels  have  their  foreground  color  set  to  red,  green,
              brown/yellow,  purple and cyan and the remaining 4 levels are set to white.  All these colors also
              can be set or modified permanently in the configuration files.  See the example file above for  an
              example.

              The  optional  second argument (<u>attr</u>) can be used to override the default or configured attributes
              of each class.  Its syntax is the same as the one used in the configuration file:
              [<u>fg</u>][/<u>bg</u>][,{<u>b</u>|<u>d</u>|<u>r</u>|<u>s</u>|<u>u</u>|<u>i</u>|<u>n</u>|<u>l</u>}] | [{<u>b</u>|<u>d</u>|<u>r</u>|<u>s</u>|<u>u</u>|<u>i</u>|<u>n</u>|<u>l</u>}]

              Examples of possible attributes are:
                <b>2/0,bu</b> green on black bold underline
                <b>/2</b>     green background
                <b>5</b>      text in purple
                <b>rb</b>     reverse bold

              <u>\u</u> and <u>\U</u> sequences can be used in the pattern.

       <b>-z</b>|<b>-zap</b>|<b>-zap_glyphs</b> <u>bytes</u>
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              Initializes a set of <b>UTF-8</b> characters to be ignored when reading words from stdin or a file.

              Example: The argument '\u0d\ue282ac,' means: ignore all commas, Euro  signs  and  carriage  return
              characters when reading from stdin or a file.

              As shown above <u>\u</u> and <u>\U</u> sequences can be used in the bytes set.

       <b>-T</b>|<b>-tm</b>|<b>-tag</b>|<b>-tag_mode</b> [<u>delim</u>]
              (Allowed in the following contexts: "Main", "Columns", "Lines", and "Tabulations", switches to the
              "Tagging" context.)

              Allows  multiple  selections and switches to <b>tag</b> mode.  In this mode, several selectable words can
              be selected without leaving the program.

              Tagged words are highlighted (underlined by default).

              The current word can be automatically tagged when  the  <b>ENTER</b>  key  is  pressed  to  complete  the
              selection process if the <b>-p</b>|<b>-at</b>|<b>-auto_tag</b> option is also set or if no word has been tagged.

              Note  that nothing is selected when no word is tagged and when the <b>-0</b>|<b>-noat</b>|<b>-no_auto_tag</b> option is
              also set.

              All tagged words (and possibly the world under the cursor) will be sent  to  the  standard  output
              separated by the optional argument given after the option <b>-T</b>|<b>-tm</b>|<b>-tag</b>|<b>-tag_mode</b>.

              Note that the <u>delim</u> argument can contain more than one character, can contain <b>UTF-8</b> characters (in
              native or <u>\u</u> or <u>\U</u> form) and can even contain control character as in <b>$'\n'</b>.

              A single space character is used as the default separator if none is given.

              <b>Caution</b>:  To get exactly the same behavior as in version 0.9.11 and earlier, you must also use the
              <b>-p</b>|<b>-at</b>|<b>-auto_tag</b> option.

       <b>-P</b>|<b>-pm</b>|<b>-pin</b>|<b>-pin_mode</b> [<u>delim</u>]
              (Allowed in the following contexts: "Main", "Columns", "Lines", and "Tabulations", switches to the
              "Tagging" context.)

              Works like <b>-T</b>|<b>-tm</b>|<b>-tag</b>|<b>-tag_mode</b> but, unlike <b>-T</b>|<b>-tm</b>|<b>-tag</b>|<b>-tag_mode</b>,  the  output  depends  on  the
              order  in  which  the words were tagged.  In other words, the first tagged word comes first in the
              output, the second tagged word comes next, and so on.

       <b>-p</b>|<b>-at</b>|<b>-auto_tag</b>
              (Allowed in the "Tagging" context.)

              This option modifies the default behavior of the <b>-T</b>|<b>-tm</b>|<b>-tag</b>|<b>-tag_mode</b>  and  <b>-P</b>|<b>-pm</b>|<b>-pin</b>|<b>-pin_mode</b>
              options.

              An untagged word under the cursor will be automatically tagged when <b>ENTER</b> is pressed.

       <b>-0</b>|<b>-noat</b>|<b>-no-auto_tag</b>
              (Allowed in the "Tagging" context.)

              This  option  modifies the default behavior of the <b>-T</b>|<b>-tm</b>|<b>-tag</b>|<b>-tag_mode</b> and <b>-P</b>|<b>-pm</b>|<b>-pin</b>|<b>-pin_mode</b>
              options.

              An untagged word under the cursor will <b>not</b> be automatically tagged when <b>ENTER</b> is  pressed  <b>and</b>  no
              other words are tagged.  This is true even when the option <b>-p</b>|<b>-at</b>|<b>-auto_tag</b> is also set.

              It is ignored if at least one other word is tagged at that time.

       <b>-N</b>|<b>-number</b>&gt;da_ctx... [<u>regex</u>]
              (Allowed in the following contexts: "Main", "Columns", "Lines" and "Tabulation".)

              This option allows you to number selectable words that match a specific regular expression.  These
              numbers are numbered from 1 and allow direct access to the words.

              To  use  this functionality, the user must enter the number which corresponds to the desired entry
              digit per digit.

              Each new digit must be added in a time frame of 1/2 seconds (per default) otherwise the number  is
              considered  complete  and  a  newly entered digit will start a new number.  If the number does not
              exists, then the cursor is restored to it's initial position.

              The sub-options of the <b>-D</b>|<b>-data</b>|<b>-options</b> option described below can change the way <b>-N</b>|<b>-number</b> sets
              and formats the numbers.

              This option accepts more than one argument and can be used multiple times with cumulative effects.

              <b>-N</b>|<b>-number</b>, <b>-U</b>|<b>-unnumber</b> and <b>-F</b>|<b>-en</b>|<b>-embedded_number</b> can be mixed.

       <b>-U</b>|<b>-unnumber</b>&gt;da_ctx... [<u>regex</u>]
              (Allowed in the following contexts: "Main", "Columns", "Lines" and "Tabulation".)

              This option allows one to unnumber words.  If placed after a previous <b>-N</b>|<b>-number</b>, it can  be  used
              to  remove  the  numbering  of selected words.  If placed before, the word which doesn't match its
              regular expression will be numbered by default.

              This mechanism is similar to to the inclusion/exclusion of words by <b>-i</b>|<b>-in</b>|<b>-inc</b>|<b>-incl</b>|<b>-include</b> and
              <b>-e</b>|<b>-ex</b>|<b>-exc</b>|<b>-excl</b>|<b>-exclude</b>.

              This option accepts more than one argument and can be used multiple times with cumulative effects.

              <b>-U</b>|<b>-unnumber</b>, <b>-N</b>|<b>-number</b> and <b>-F</b>|<b>-en</b>|<b>-embedded_number</b> can be mixed.

       <b>-F</b>|<b>-en</b>|<b>-embedded_number</b>
              (Allowed in the following contexts: "Main", "Columns", "Lines" and "Tabulation".)

              This option is similar to <b>-N</b>|<b>-number</b> but does not  generate  a  continuous  flow  of  numbers  but
              extracts them from the word itself.

              With  this option you can take full control of the numbering of the displayed word.  Note that the
              numbering does not need to be ordered.

              The resulting word after the extraction of the number must be non empty.

              Some sub-option are required, see the <b>-D</b>|<b>-data</b>|<b>-options</b> option described below.

              <b>Notice</b> that for this option to work correctly, all the embedded numbers must have the same  number
              of digits.  To get that, a preprocessing may be necessary on the words before using this program.

              <b>-F</b>|<b>-en</b>|<b>-embedded_number</b>, <b>-N</b>|<b>-number</b> and <b>-U</b>|<b>-unnumber</b> can be mixed.

       <b>-D</b>|<b>-data</b>|<b>-options</b> [<u>parameter</u>...]
              (Allowed in the Following contexts: "Main", "Columns", "Lines" and "Tabulations".)

              This  option  allows  one  to  change  the  default  behavior  of the <b>-N</b>|<b>-number</b>, <b>-U</b>|<b>-unnumber</b> and
              <b>-F</b>|<b>-en</b>|<b>-embedded_number</b> options.

              Its optional parameters are called sub-options and must respect the format <b>x</b>:<b>y</b> where <b>x</b> can be:

              <b>l</b> (<b>-F</b>|<b>-en</b>|<b>-embedded_number</b>, <b>-N</b>|<b>-number</b> and <b>-U</b>|<b>-unnumber</b> options)
                     Here <b>y</b> is the <b>UTF-8</b> character (in native or <u>\u</u> or <u>\U</u> form) to print before the number.  The
                     default is a single space.

              <b>r</b> (<b>-F</b>|<b>-en</b>|<b>-embedded_number</b>, <b>-N</b>|<b>-number</b> and <b>-U</b>|<b>-unnumber</b> options)
                     Here <b>y</b> is the <b>UTF-8</b> character (in native or <u>\u</u> or <u>\U</u> form) to print after the number.   The
                     default is <b>)</b>.

              <b>a</b> (<b>-F</b>|<b>-en</b>|<b>-embedded_number</b>, <b>-N</b>|<b>-number</b> and <b>-U</b>|<b>-unnumber</b> options)
                     Here  <b>y</b>  is  '<b>left</b>' (or one of its prefixes) if the number must be <u>left</u> aligned, or '<b>right</b>'
                     (or one of its prefixes) if it must be <u>right</u> aligned.  The default is <b>right</b>.

              <b>p</b> (<b>-F</b>|<b>-en</b>|<b>-embedded_number</b>, <b>-N</b>|<b>-number</b> and <b>-U</b>|<b>-unnumber</b> options)
                     Here <b>y</b> is '<b>included</b>' or '<b>all</b>' for the initial <u>p</u>adding  of  the  non  numbered  words.   The
                     keyword  '<b>included</b>'  means that only <u>included</u> word will be padded while '<b>all</b>' means pad <u>all</u>
                     words.

                     The default is <b>all</b>. These keywords can be abbreviated.

              <b>w</b> (<b>-F</b>|<b>-en</b>|<b>-embedded_number</b>, <b>-N</b>|<b>-number</b> and <b>-U</b>|<b>-unnumber</b> options)
                     Here <b>y</b> is the <u>w</u>idth of the number between 1 and 5 included.

              <b>f</b> (<b>-F</b>|<b>-en</b>|<b>-embedded_number</b>, <b>-N</b>|<b>-number</b> and <b>-U</b>|<b>-unnumber</b> options)
                     Here <b>y</b> controls if the numbering must <u>f</u>ollow the last extracted number (defaults to <b>yes</b>) or
                     if it must remain independent.

                     The possible values are <b>yes</b> and <b>no</b> but can be abbreviated.

              <b>m</b> (<b>-F</b>|<b>-en</b>|<b>-embedded_number</b> option)
                     Here <b>y</b> controls if the numbering of word with missing embedded numbers must be done or  not
                     (defaults to <b>yes</b>).

                     When this sub-option is set to <b>no</b>, the <b>s</b> and <b>f</b> sub-options are ignored.

                     The possible values are <b>yes</b> and <b>no</b> but can be abbreviated.

              <b>h</b> (<b>-F</b>|<b>-en</b>|<b>-embedded_number</b> option)
                     Tells what to do with the characters present before the embedded number if any.

                     The  allowed  directives  are:  '<b>trim</b>' which discards them if they form an empty word (only
                     made of spaces and tabulations), '<b>cut</b>' which unconditionally discards them and '<b>keep</b>' which
                     places them at the beginning of the resulting word.

                     The default value for this directive is '<b>keep</b>', these keywords can be abbreviated.

              <b>o</b> (<b>-F</b>|<b>-en</b>|<b>-embedded_number</b> option)
                     Here <b>y</b> is the <u>o</u>ffset of the first multibyte character of the number  to  extract  from  the
                     word (defaults to <b>0</b>).

                     If  this offset if immediately followed by the character '<b>+</b>', then the parser will look for
                     the first number (if any) after the given offset instead of using  its  absolute  value  to
                     extract the number.

                     Note  that  when  the  '<b>+</b>'  is  used, it is necessary that the length of all the numbers to
                     extract have the same size as the algorithm looks for a digit to identify the beginning  of
                     the  number to extract.  Hence, for example, <b>1</b> should appear as <b>01</b> in the input is <b>n</b> is set
                     to <b>2</b>.

              <b>n</b> (<b>-F</b>|<b>-en</b>|<b>-embedded_number</b> option)
                     Here <b>y</b> is the <u>n</u>umber of multibyte characters to extract  from  the  word  starting  at  the
                     offset given by the <b>o</b> sub-option.

                     Example: n:2 will extract and use the first 2 digits of each words from the input stream to
                     number them.

              <b>i</b> (<b>-F</b>|<b>-en</b>|<b>-embedded_number</b> option)
                     Here <b>y</b> is number of multibyte characters to <u>i</u>gnore after the extracted number

              <b>d</b> (<b>-F</b>|<b>-en</b>|<b>-embedded_number</b>, <b>-N</b>|<b>-number</b> and <b>-U</b>|<b>-unnumber</b> options)
                     Here  <b>y</b>  is  a multibyte separator.  When present, this directive instructs smenu to output
                     the selected numbered word(s) <u>prefixed</u> by its(their) direct access number(s) and the  given
                     separator.

                     Only the numbered word(s) will be prefixed.

                     <b>d</b> stands for <b>d</b>ecorate.

                     This  directive  can  be  useful  when you want to post-process the output according to its
                     direct access number.

              <b>s</b> (<b>-F</b>|<b>-en</b>|<b>-embedded_number</b>, <b>-N</b>|<b>-number</b> and <b>-U</b>|<b>-unnumber</b> options)
                     Here <b>y</b> is the direct access number that will be set for the first numbered word.  Its value
                     is <b>1</b> by default, a value of <b>0</b> is possible.

              Example: -data r:\&gt; l:\&lt; a:l d:_

              To number all words with the default parameters, use the syntax: "-N ." which is a  shortcut  for:
              "-N . -D l:' ' r:')' a:r p:a"

              The  <u>padding</u>  sub-option specifies whether spaces must also be added in front of excluded words or
              not to improve compactness.

              When the <b>w</b> sub-option is not given the width of the numbers is  determined  automatically  but  if
              <b>-F</b>|<b>-en</b>|<b>-embedded_number</b> is set and the value of the <b>n</b> sub-option is given then this value is used.

       <b>-b</b>|<b>-blank</b>
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              Replaces  all  non-printable  characters  by a blank.  If this results in a blank word, it will be
              potentially deleted.

       <b>-.</b>|<b>-dot</b>|<b>-invalid</b>
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              Sets the substitution character for non-printable characters.  When this parameter  is  not  used,
              the default substitution character is a single dot.

       <b>-M</b>|<b>-middle</b>|<b>-center</b>
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              Centers the display if possible.

       <b>-d</b>|<b>-restore</b>|<b>-delete</b>|<b>-clean</b>|<b>-delete_window</b>|<b>-clean_window</b>
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              Tells  the  program to clean up the display before quitting by removing the selection window after
              use as if it was never displayed.

       <b>-c</b>|<b>-col</b>|<b>-col_mode</b>|<b>-column</b>
              (Allowed in the "Main" and "Tagging" contexts, switches to the "Columns" context.)

              Sets the column mode.  In this mode the lines of words do not wrap when the right  border  of  the
              terminal  is  reached but only when a special character is read.  Some words will not be displayed
              without an horizontal scrolling.

              If such a scrolling is needed, some indications may appear on the  left  and  right  edge  of  the
              window to help the user to reach the unseen words.

              In  this  mode, the width of each column is minimal to keep the maximum information visible on the
              terminal.

       <b>-l</b>|<b>-line</b>|<b>-line_mode</b>
              (Allowed in the "Main" and "Tagging" contexts, switches to the "Lines" context.)

              Sets the line mode.  This mode is the same as column mode but without any column alignment.

       <b>-t</b>|<b>-tab</b>|<b>-tab_mode</b>|<b>-tabulate_mode</b> [<u>cols</u>]
              (Allowed in the "Main" and "Tagging" contexts, switches to the "Tabulations" context.)

              This option sets the tabulation mode and, if a number is specified, attempts to set the number  of
              displayed columns to that number.

              In  this  mode,  embedded line separators are ignored if not explicitly set with <b>-L</b>|<b>-ls</b>|<b>-ld</b>|<b>-line-</b>
              <b>delimiters</b>|<b>-line_separators</b>.   The  options  <b>-A</b>|<b>-fc</b>|<b>-first_column</b>  and   <b>-Z</b>|<b>-lc</b>|<b>-last_column</b>   can
              nevertheless  be  used  to  force words to appear in the first (respectively last) position of the
              displayed line.

              Note that the number of requested columns will be automatically reduced if a word does not fit  in
              the calculated column size.

              In this mode each column has the same width.

       <b>-w</b>|<b>-wide</b>|<b>-wide_mode</b>
              (Allowed in the "Columns" and "Tabulations" contexts.)

              When  <b>-t</b>|<b>-tab</b>|<b>-tab_mode</b>|<b>-tabulate_mode</b>  is  followed  by  a  number  of columns, the default is to
              compact the columns so that they use the less terminal width as possible.   This  option  enlarges
              the columns in order to use the whole terminal width.

              When  in  column  mode,  <b>-w</b>|<b>-wide</b>|<b>-wide_mode</b> can be used to force all the columns to have the same
              size (the largest one).  See option <b>-c</b>|<b>-col</b>|<b>-col_mode</b>|<b>-column</b> below.

              Note that the column's size is only calculated once when the words are  displayed  for  the  first
              time.  A terminal resize will not update this value.  This choice enables a faster display.

       <b>-C</b>|<b>-cs</b>|<b>-cols</b>|<b>-cols_select</b>... [<u>i</u>|<u>e</u>]<u>selectors</u>...
              (Allowed in the "Columns" context.)

              <u>I</u> and <u>E</u> have the same meaning as <u>i</u> and <u>e</u>.

              In  column  mode,  this  option  is  useful to restrict the selections to a subset of all columns.
              Either by including (nothing or <u>i</u>) or by excluding (<u>e</u>) them.

              Columns can be designated by their number (1  based)  or  by  a  regular  expression  enclosed  in
              delimiter made from any non-blank ASCII character excluding the comma.

              Range of columns (number or RE) can be given by separated then with a dash.

              Multiple  selectors  can  be regrouped in one argument using commas to separate them.  This option
              also accepts multiple arguments, each of them being a selector.

              A selection by regular expressions means that a column containing a word  matching  any  of  these
              expressions  will be included or excluded depending on the letter given after the option or before
              the selector if there is more than one argument.

              Regular expressions and column numbers can be freely mixed.

              Regular expression in <b>-C</b>|<b>-cs</b>|<b>-cols</b>|<b>-cols_select</b> and <b>-R</b>|<b>-rs</b>|<b>-rows</b>|<b>-rows_select</b>  can  contain  <b>UTF-8</b>
              characters either directly or by using the <u>\u</u> or <u>\U</u> notation.

              Example  of  columns  selection:  <b>-Ci2,3,/X./,5-7</b>  forces  the  cursor to only navigate in columns
              <b>2</b>,<b>3</b>,<b>5</b>,<b>6</b> and <b>7</b> and those containing a two characters word starting with '<b>X</b>'.   If  <u>e</u>  was  used  in
              place  of  <u>i</u>,  all  the  columns  would  have been selected <b>except</b> the columns <b>2</b>,<b>3</b>,<b>5</b>,<b>6</b>,<b>7</b> and those
              matching the extended regular expression '<b>X.</b>'.

              Spaces are allowed in the selection string if they are protected.

              Other example where multiple selectors are used as multiple  arguments:  <b>ps</b>  <b>|</b>  <b>smenu</b>  <b>-col</b>  <b>-cols</b>
              <b>e/TTY/</b> <b>e/CMD/</b> <b>e3</b>

       <b>-R</b>|<b>-rs</b>|<b>-rows</b>|<b>-rows_select</b>... <u>selectors</u>...
              (Allowed in the "Columns" and "Lines" contexts.)

              Similar to <b>-C</b>|<b>-cs</b>|<b>-cols</b>|<b>-cols_select</b> but for the rows.

              <b>-C</b>|<b>-cs</b>|<b>-cols</b>|<b>-cols_select</b> and <b>-R</b>|<b>-rs</b>|<b>-rows</b>|<b>-rows_select</b> can be used more than once in a cumulative
              manner:

              The  selection  mode  (selection or de-selection) is given by the first occurrence of the options,
              the other occurrences will only update the selected or de-selected ranges.

              Once a column or a row has been excluded, it cannot be re-included.

       <b>-A</b>|<b>-fc</b>|<b>-first_column</b> <u>regex</u>
              (Allowed in the following contexts: "Columns", "Lines" and "Tabulations".)

              In column mode, forces all words matching the given regular expression to be the first one in  the
              displayed line.  If you want to only rely on this method to build the lines, just specify an empty
              <b>regex</b> to set the end-of-line separator with <b>-L</b>|<b>-ls</b>|<b>-ld</b>|<b>-line-delimiters</b>|<b>-line_separators</b> '')

              <u>\u</u> and <u>\U</u> sequences can also be used in the regexp after <b>-A</b>|<b>-fc</b>|<b>-first_column</b>.

       <b>-Z</b>|<b>-lc</b>|<b>-last_column</b> <u>regex</u>
              (Allowed in the following contexts: "Columns", "Lines" and "Tabulations".)

              Similar  to <b>-A</b>|<b>-fc</b>|<b>-first_column</b> but forces the word to be the latest of its line.  The same trick
              with <b>-L</b>|<b>-ls</b>|<b>-ld</b>|<b>-line-delimiters</b>|<b>-line_separators</b> can also be used.

              <u>\u</u> and <u>\U</u> sequences can also be used in the regexp after <b>-Z</b>|<b>-lc</b>|<b>-last_column</b>.

       <b>-g</b>|<b>-gutter</b> [<u>string</u>]
              (Allowed in the "Columns" and "Tabulations" contexts.)

              Replaces the blank after each words in column or tabular mode by a column separator.

              This separator is extracted from the <u>string</u> argument and each of its (multibyte) character is used
              one after the other to fill the gutter.

              If there are more columns that gutter characters then the last character is used for the remaining
              columns.

              When not given, the separator defaults to a vertical bar <u>|</u> (or a full height vertical bar  if  the
              locale is set to <b>UTF-8</b>).

              Each character can be given in normal or <u>\u</u> or <u>\U</u> form in the <u>string</u> argument.

              Example:  "<b>|-</b>  "  will allow one to separate the first two columns with '<b>|</b>', then '<b>-</b>' will be used
              and ' ' will separate the remaining columns if any.

       <b>-k</b>|<b>-ks</b>|<b>-keep_spaces</b>
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              By default, the spaces surrounding the output string will be deleted.  This option forces them  to
              be retained.

       <b>-W</b>|<b>-ws</b>|<b>-wd</b>|<b>-word_delimiters</b>|<b>-word_separators</b> <u>bytes</u>
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              This  option  can be used to specify the characters (or multibyte sequences) which will be used to
              delimit the input words.

              Multibyte sequences (<b>UTF-8</b>) can be natives of using the same ASCII representation used in words (a
              leading <u>\u</u> or <u>\U</u> following by up to 8 hexadecimal characters for  the  former  and  6  hexadecimal
              characters for the latter).

              Non-printable  characters  in  arguments  should  be  given using the standard <u>$''</u> representation.
              <u>$'\t'</u> stands for the tabulation character for example.

              The default delimiters are: <u>SPACE</u>, <u>$'\t'</u> and <u>$'\n'</u>.

       <b>-L</b>|<b>-ls</b>|<b>-ld</b>|<b>-line-delimiters</b>|<b>-line_separators</b> <u>bytes</u>
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              This option can be used to specify the characters (or multibyte sequences) which will be  used  to
              delimit the lines in the input stream.

              Multibyte sequences (<b>UTF-8</b>) can be natives of using the same ASCII representation used in words (a
              leading  <u>\u</u>  or  <u>\U</u>  following  by up to 8 hexadecimal characters for the former and 6 hexadecimal
              characters for the latter).

              Non-printable characters in arguments should be  given  using  the  standard  $''  representation.
              $'\n' stands for the newline character for example.

              The default delimiter is: <u>$'\n'</u>.

              This option is only useful when the <b>-c</b>|<b>-col</b>|<b>-col_mode</b>|<b>-column</b> or <b>-l</b> option is also set.

              The characters (or multibyte sequences) passed to <b>-L</b>|<b>-ls</b>|<b>-ld</b>|<b>-line-delimiters</b>|<b>-line_separators</b> are
              automatically      added      to      the      list      of      word     delimiters     as     if
              <b>-W</b>|<b>-ws</b>|<b>-wd</b>|<b>-word_delimiters</b>|<b>-word_separators</b> was also used.

              <u>\u</u> and <u>\U</u> sequences can also be used here.

       <b>-q</b>|<b>-no_bar</b>|<b>-no-scroll_bar</b>
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              Prevents the display of the scroll bar.

       <b>-S</b>|<b>-subst</b>... /<u>regex</u>/<u>repl</u>/[<u>g</u>][<u>v</u>][<u>s</u>]
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              Post-processes the words by applying a regular expression based substitution.  The  argument  must
              be formatted as in the <b>sed</b> editor.

              As  in  <b>sed</b>, matching groups and references to these groups (from <b>\0</b> to <b>\9</b> in <u>repl</u>) are supported.
              These groups must be surrounded by <b>(</b> and <b>)</b> in <u>regex</u>.  <b>\0</b> and <b>&amp;</b> are equivalent in <u>repl</u>  as  in  the
              GNU version of <b>sed</b>.

              Back reference example:

              <b>R=$(echo</b> <b>"[A]</b> <b>[B]</b> <b>[C]"</b> <b>|</b> <b>./smenu</b> <b>-S</b> <b>'/([^][]+)/:\1:/')</b>
              will display "[:A:] [:B:] [:C:]"

              This  option  can  be  used more than once.  Each substitution will be applied in sequence on each
              word.  This sequence can be stopped if a <b>stop</b> flag is encountered.

              <b>flags:</b>

              • The optional trailing <b>g</b> (for <u>g</u>lobal) means that all matching occurrences shall be  replaced  and
                not only the first one.

              • The  optional trailing <b>v</b> (for <u>v</u>isual) means that the altered words will only be used for display
                and search.  The modifications will <u>not</u> be reflected in the returned word.

              • The optional trailing <b>s</b> (for <u>s</u>top) means that no more substitution will be allowed on this  word
                even if another <b>-S</b>|<b>-subst</b> is used.

              • The  optional  trailing <b>i</b> (for <u>i</u>gnore case) means that the string search operation should ignore
                the case for this pattern.

                Small examples to explain the meaning of <u>v</u>:

                <b>R=$(echo</b> <b>a</b> <b>b</b> <b>c</b> <b>|</b> <b>smenu</b> <b>-S</b> <b>/b/B/)</b>
                will display "a B c" and <b>R</b> will contain <u>B</u> when <u>B</u> is selected meanwhile

                <b>R=$(echo</b> <b>a</b> <b>b</b> <b>c</b> <b>|</b> <b>smenu</b> <b>-S</b> <b>/b/B/v)</b>
                will display the same as above but <b>R</b> will contain the original word <u>b</u> when <u>B</u> is selected.

                In both cases, only the word <u>B</u> will be searchable and not <u>b</u>.

       <b>-I</b>|<b>-si</b>|<b>-subst_included</b>... /<u>regex</u>/<u>repl</u>/[<u>g</u>][<u>v</u>][<u>s</u>]
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              Post-processes the <b>selectable</b> words by applying  a  regular  expression  based  substitution  (see
              <b>-S</b>|<b>-subst</b> for details).

       <b>-E</b>|<b>-se</b>|<b>-subst_excluded</b>... /<u>regex</u>/<u>repl</u>/[<u>g</u>][<u>v</u>][<u>s</u>]
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              Post-processes  the  <b>excluded</b>  (or  <b>non-selectable</b>)  words  by applying a regular expression based
              substitution (see <b>-S</b>|<b>-subst</b> for details).

              The <b>/</b> separator that <b>-I</b>|<b>-si</b>|<b>-subst_included</b> and <b>-E</b>|<b>-se</b>|<b>-subst_excluded</b>  are  using  above  can  be
              substituted by any other character except <u>SPACE</u>, <u>\t</u>, <u>\f</u>, <u>\n</u>, <u>\r</u> and <u>\v</u>.

              In  the three previous options, <u>regex</u> is a <b>POSIX</b> <b>E</b>xtended <b>R</b>egular <b>E</b>xpression.  For details, please
              refer to the <b><a href="../man7/regex.7.html">regex</a>(7)</b> manual page.

              Additionally <u>\u</u> and <u>\U</u> sequences can also be used in the regexp.

       If a post-processing action (<b>-S</b>|<b>-subst</b>, <b>-I</b>|<b>-si</b>|<b>-subst_included</b>,  <b>-E</b>|<b>-se</b>|<b>-subst_excluded</b>)  results  in  an
       empty (length = 0) word, then we have two cases:

              in column mode:
                     Substitutions  involving  empty  words  can  lead  to  misalignments, so it is necessary to
                     prohibit them and terminate the program.  These substitutions have to be  made  with  other
                     tools before using this utility.

              otherwise:
                     The word is simply removed.

       <b>-ES</b>|<b>-subst</b>... /<u>regex</u>/<u>repl</u>/[<u>g</u>][<u>v</u>][<u>s</u>]
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              Pre-processes  words  by applying a substitution based on a regular expression.  The argument must
              be formatted as in the <b>sed</b> editor.

              The substitutions are made, as the name of the option indicates, before  any  other  selection  or
              coloring actions are made.

              This  option  can  be  used more than once.  Each substitution will be applied in sequence on each
              word.  This sequence can be stopped if a <b>stop</b> flag is encountered.

              In summary, this option is similar to the <b>-S</b>|<b>-subst</b> option previously described, except  that  the
              substitutions are made earlier and certain flags like <b>visual</b> are ignored.

              Note  that  this  option  can be used in conjunction with the other substitution options mentioned
              above.

       <b>-/</b>|<b>-search_method</b> <u>search_method</u>
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              Affects the '<b>/</b>' key to a search method.  By default '<b>/</b>' is affected to '<u>fuzzy</u>'  but  the  argument
              can be any prefix of '<u>prefix</u>', '<u>substring</u>' or '<u>fuzzy</u>'.

       <b>-s</b>|<b>-sp</b>|<b>-start</b>|<b>-start_pattern</b> <u>pattern</u>
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              Place the cursor on the first word corresponding to the specified pattern.

              <u>pattern</u> can be:

              • A  <b>#</b>  immediately  followed by a <b>number</b> giving the initial position of the cursor (counting from
                0).

                If the word at this position is excluded, then the first previous non excluded word is  selected
                if it exists, otherwise the first non excluded word is selected.

                If  this  number  if  greater  than the number of words, the cursor will be placed on the latest
                selectable position.

              • A single <b>#</b> or the string <b>#last</b> to set the initial cursor position on the latest selectable  word
                position.

              • A  string  starting  with  a <b>/</b> indicating that we want the cursor to be placed on the first word
                matching the given regular expression.

              • A string starting with a <b>=</b> indicating than we want the cursor to be placed on that exact word.

              • A normal string. In this case the cursor will be placed on the first  word  starting  with  that
                string (<b>Ca</b> will match <b>Cancel</b> by example).

              Warning,  when  searching for a prefix or a regular expression, smenu only looks for them after an
              eventual modification, so for example, the command: <b>smenu</b> <b>-I/c/x/</b> <b>-s/c</b> <b>&lt;&lt;&lt;</b> <b>"a</b> <b>b</b> <b>c</b> <b>d"</b> won't find  c
              and  put  the cursor on <b>a</b> but <b>smenu</b> <b>-I/c/x/v</b> <b>-s/c</b> <b>&lt;&lt;&lt;</b> <b>"a</b> <b>b</b> <b>c</b> <b>d"</b> will find it and put the cursor on
              the <b>x</b> substituting the <b>c</b> on screen only

              <u>\u</u> and <u>\U</u> sequences can be used in the pattern.

       <b>-x</b>|<b>-tmout</b>|<b>-timeout</b> <u>type</u> [<u>word</u>] <u>delay</u>

       <b>-X</b>|<b>-htmout</b>|<b>-hidden_timeout</b> <u>type</u> [<u>word</u>] <u>delay</u>
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              Sets a timeout.  Three types of timeout are possible:

              current:  At the timeout, the word under the cursor and/or  the  tagged  words  are  sent  to  the
                        standard output if the <b>ENTER</b> key has been pressed

              quit:     At the timeout, nothing is selected as if the <b>q</b> key has been pressed

              word:     At  the timeout, the word given after the type is selected.  Note that this word doesn't
                        need to be part of the words coming from the standard input.

              Each type can be be shortened as a prefix of its full name ("cur" for "current" of "q" for  "quit"
              per example).

              The delay must be set in seconds and cannot be greater than 99999 seconds.

              The  remaining  time (in seconds) is added at the end of the message displayed above the selection
              window and is updated in real time each second.

              Any key except <b>ENTER</b>, <b>q</b>, <b>Q</b> and <b>CTRL</b> <b>C</b> resets the timer to its initial value.

              The <b>-X</b>|<b>-htmout</b>|<b>-hidden_timeout</b> version works like <b>-x</b>|<b>-tmout</b>|<b>-timeout</b>  but  no  periodic  remaining
              messages is displayed above the selection window.

       <b>-r</b>|<b>-auto_validate</b>
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              Enables <b>ENTER</b> to validate the selection even in search mode.

       <b>-is</b>|<b>-incremental_search</b>
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              By default, when a new search session is initiated, the current search buffer is reset.  When this
              parameter  is  set,  the next search will start where the last search ended, except if <b>ESC</b> was hit
              before.

              This option instructs not to clean the previous search buffer each time a new  search  session  is
              started.

       <b>-v</b>|<b>-vb</b>|<b>-visual_bell</b>
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              By  default, when searching, an alarm is produced by the terminal when the user enters a character
              or makes a move which lead to no result or to an error condition.  This argument  make  this  beep
              visual by briefly showing the cursor.

       <b>-Q</b>|<b>-ignore_quotes</b>
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              Using  this  option will remove the word grouping feature from single and double quotes which will
              be considered normal characters.  For example: <b>"a</b> <b>b"</b> will be considered by smenu as two  words  <b>"a</b>
              and <b>b"</b> and no more as a single word: <b>a</b> <b>b</b>.

       <b>-lim</b>|<b>-limits</b> <u>limit:value</u>...
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              This option gives the possibility to modify the default maximum number of words or columns and the
              maximum permitted word length.

              The  specified values overload the default settings and/or the settings given in the configuration
              files.

              In order to do that, three sub-options can be used:

              <b>l</b>:value
                to set the maximum word length allowed.

              <b>w</b>:value
                to set the maximum number of words allowed.

              <b>c</b>:value
                to set the maximum number of columns allowed.

              Several sub-options, separated by spaces, can be given after this option.

       [<b>-f</b>|<b>-forgotten_timeout</b>|<b>-global_timeout</b> <u>timeout</u>]
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              This option defines a global timeout in seconds.  The program will end without  error  after  this
              period of inactivity.

              This timer is reset to its initial value each time a key is pressed.

              Its  default  value  is  "unlimited",  but  it  can be changed by assigning a number (in tenths of
              seconds) to the "forgotten" entry in the [timers] section of the optional configuration file.  See
              the example in the configuration sub-section.

              A value of 0 as an argument disables this timer and replaces the default value.

       [<b>-nm</b>|<b>-no_mouse</b>]
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              This option allows you to disable the mouse even if smenu can use it.

       [<b>-br</b>|<b>-buttons</b>|<b>-button_remapping</b> <u>new_button_1</u> <u>new_button_3</u>]
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              This option allows one to remap the mouse buttons.  The buttons are numbered from 1 to  3  but  as
              smenu only uses buttons 1 and 3, only two arguments are required.

              By example, the syntax -br 3 1 will reverse the first (left) and third (right?) buttons.

              The default mapping is 1 3.

       [<b>-dc</b>|<b>-dcd</b>|<b>-double_click</b>|<b>-double_click_delay</b> <u>delay_in_ms</u>]
              (Allowed in all contexts.)

              This  option  allows one to set the double-click delay in the range of 100 ms (1/10 second) to 500
              ms (1/2 second).  The default delay of 150 ms (1/6.66 second) will be used if the given  value  is
              out of range or invalid.

              The double-click capability can also be disabled by setting <u>delay_in_ms</u> to <b>0</b>.

              This  setting is also configurable in a configuration file, see the [mouse] section in the example
              in the configuration sub-section.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       If tabulators (<u>\t</u>) are embedded in the input, there is no way to replace them with the original number of
       spaces.  In this case use another filter (like <u>expand</u>) to pre-process the data.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>1</b>
       Simple Yes/No/Cancel request with "No" as default choice:

       In <b>bash</b>:
         <b>read</b> <b>R</b> <b>&lt;&lt;&lt;</b> <b>$(echo</b> <b>"Yes</b> <b>No</b> <b>Cancel"</b> <b>\</b>
                      <b>|</b> <b>smenu</b>  <b>-d</b> <b>-m</b> <b>"Please</b> <b>choose:"</b> <b>-s</b> <b>/N)</b>

       or
         <b>R=$(echo</b> <b>"Yes</b> <b>No</b> <b>Cancel"</b> <b>\</b>
             <b>|</b> <b>smenu</b> <b>-d</b> <b>-m</b> <b>"Please</b> <b>choose:"</b> <b>-s</b> <b>/N)</b>

       In <b>ksh</b>:
         <b>print</b> <b>"Yes</b> <b>No</b> <b>Cancel"</b>                <b>\</b>
         <b>|</b> <b>smenu</b> <b>-d</b> <b>-m</b> <b>"Please</b> <b>choose:"</b> <b>-s</b> <b>/N</b> <b>\</b>
         <b>|</b> <b>read</b> <b>R</b>

   <b>2</b>
       Get a 3 columns report about VM statistics for the current process in <b>bash</b>/<b>ksh</b> on Linux:

       <b>R=$(grep</b> <b>Vm</b> <b><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>$$/status</b> <b>|</b> <b>expand</b> <b>|</b> <b>smenu</b> <b>-b</b> <b>-W$'\n'</b> <b>-t3</b> <b>-g</b> <b>-d)</b>

   <b>3</b>
       Create a one column selection window containing the list of the first 20 LVM physical  volumes.   At  the
       end, the selection window will be erased.  This example is written in <b>ksh</b>).

       <b>pvs</b> <b>-a</b> <b>-o</b> <b>pv_name</b> <b>--noheadings</b>                 <b>\</b>
       <b>|</b> <b>smenu</b> <b>-m</b> <b>"PV</b> <b>list"</b> <b>-n20</b> <b>-t1</b> <b>-d</b> <b>-s</b> <b>//dev/root</b> <b>\</b>
       <b>|</b> <b>read</b> <b>R</b>

       The display will have a look similar to the following with the cursor set on the word <u>/dev/root</u>:

       PV list
       /dev/md126           \
       /dev/md127           |
       /dev/root            | &lt;- cursor here.
       /dev/sda2            |
       /dev/sdb2            |
       /dev/sdc1            |
       /dev/sdc2            |
       /dev/system/homevol  /

   <b>4</b> <b>(advanced)</b>
       Imagine a file named <b>sample.mnu</b> with the following content:

       --8&lt;---------------------------------
       "1 First Entry" "3 Third entry"
       "2 Second entry" "4 Fourth entry"
       @@@ "5 Fifth entry"
       @@@
       "0 Exit menu"
       --8&lt;---------------------------------

       Then this quite esoteric command will render it (centered on the screen) as:

       +----------------------------------+
       |            Test menu             |
       |                                  |
       | 1) First Entry   3) Third entry  |
       | 2) Second entry  4) Fourth entry |
       |                  5) Fifth entry  |
       |                                  |
       | 0) Exit menu                     |
       +----------------------------------+

       with the cursor on <u>Quit</u> and only the numbers and "Quit" selectable.

       <b>R=$(smenu</b> <b>-q</b> <b>-d</b> <b>-s/Exit</b> <b>-M</b> <b>-n</b> <b>30</b> <b>-c</b>        <b>\</b>
                 <b>-e</b> <b>"@+"</b> <b>-E</b> <b>'/@+/</b> <b>/'</b>              <b>\</b>
                 <b>-F</b> <b>-D</b> <b>n:1</b> <b>i:1</b>                    <b>\</b>
                 <b>-m</b> <b>"Test</b> <b>menu"</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>sample.mnu)</b>

       <b>The</b> <b>selected</b> <b>entry</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> <b>R</b>

       <b>Try</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise.</b>

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <u>NO_COLOR</u>       force a monochrome terminal when set.
       <u>CTXOPT_DEBUG</u>   put the option parser in debug mode.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS/LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Some    terminal   emulators,   those   notably   based   on   VTE   version   later   than   0.35   (see
       https://github.com/GNOME/vte/commit/01380d), have a new  feature  that  gives  them  the  possibility  to
       wrap/unwrap already displayed lines when resizing the window.

       As far as I known, there is no terminfo entry to disable that.

       On  these  types of terminals, the automatic re-display of the output of smenu will be disturbed and some
       artifacts may appear on the screen if the terminal window is resized.
