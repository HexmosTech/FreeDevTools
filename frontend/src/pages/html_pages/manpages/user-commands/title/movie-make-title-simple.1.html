</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>movie-make-title-simple</b>  -  Creates a simple title sequence that can be used to create a menu with <b>movie-</b>
       <b>title</b>

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>movie-make-title-simple</b> <u>-o</u> <u>output</u> <u>-m</u> <u>mode</u> <u>[-i</u> <u>image</u> <u>[-s]]</u> <u>[-b</u> <u>background]</u> <u>[-a</u> <u>audio]</u> <u>[-n</u> <u>animation]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program allows you to create a simple menu background for use with the  <b>movie-title</b>  program,  which
       can then be used to create menus for DVDs with more than one menu on them.

       You  have  the  option of telling the program to use an empty background of a specific color (black being
       the default color) or to use an image that you supply to put in the background (optionally scaled to  fit
       the screen).

       Further,  you have the option of supplying an audio track to be played while the menu is being displayed.
       If you do not specify an audio track, no audio  will  be  played:  this  also  means  that  the  menu  is
       completely  static, and animated picture-in-picture versions of the movies that are displayed in the menu
       are not possible, only static pictures are possible in this case.

       The best way to grasp how the system works is by trying it out for yourself.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are available:

       <b>-o</b> <b>output</b>
              Specifies the name of the directory that should be created and will contain a number of JPEG files
              and a WAV file for the audio of the title sequence after  the  program  is  done.   Personally,  I
              usually use the name <b>title</b> (short and to-the-point).

       <b>-m</b> <b>mode</b>
              Specify  either  <b>pal</b> or <b>ntsc</b>, depending on whether you are creating a PAL or NTSC DVD.  NTSC is an
              American TV standard, PAL is usually used in Europe and other parts of the world.

       <b>-i</b> <b>image</b>
              If you specify this option, you can supply the filename  of  an  image  in  any  format  that  the
              ImageMagick  suite  understands,  and  that  image will be displayed in the background of your DVD
              menu.  The image will be displayed in its original format, unless you specify the <b>-s</b>  option  (see
              below).

              A  PAL  menu is 720 pixels wide and 576 pixels in height.  An NTSC menu is 720 pixels wide and 480
              pixels in height.  The aspect ratio of either is not exactly 4:3, but is close enough.

              If your picture is larger than the resolution of the menu itself, it will be scaled down  (keeping
              the  aspect ratio intact) to fit on the screen.  If your picture does not have the same dimensions
              as the menu and leaves borders, the color of those borders can de determined using the  <b>-b</b>  option
              (see below).

       <b>-s</b>     This  option  may  only be specified if you specify the <b>-i</b> option as well.  Otherwise, the program
              will complain and abort.

              This option, if specified, causes the image that was specified using the <b>-i</b> option to be scaled to
              the size of the menu itself (making it as large as possible without any  pixels  falling  off  any
              edge).   If  your picture is not the same shape as the menu and leaves borders, the color of those
              borders can de determined using the <b>-b</b> option (see below).

       <b>-b</b> <b>background</b>
              Using this option, you can determine the color of the background of the menu that is  not  covered
              by  the  optional  image  that may be supplied using the <b>-i</b> option.  If the <b>-i</b> option is not used,
              this option determines the color of the entire background.

              The color must be in the format <b>rgb</b>, <b>#rgb</b>, <b>rrggbb</b> or  <b>#rrggbb</b>.   The  latter  is  the  same  color
              notation as is used on the web.  Examples are:

              <b>000000</b>    Black
              <b>000088</b>    Dark blue
              <b>0000ff</b>    Bright blue
              <b>008800</b>    Dark green
              <b>00ff00</b>    Bright green
              <b>880000</b>    Dark red
              <b>ff0000</b>    Bright red
              <b>008888</b>    Dark cyan
              <b>00ffff</b>    Bright cyan
              <b>880088</b>    Dark magenta
              <b>ff00ff</b>    Bright magenta
              <b>888800</b>    Brown
              <b>ffff00</b>    Yellow
              <b>888888</b>    Grey
              <b>ffffff</b>    White

              There    are    numerous    color    choosers    out    on    the    web,    one   of   which   is
              <b><a href="http://www.ficml.org/jemimap/style/color/wheel.html">http://www.ficml.org/jemimap/style/color/wheel.html</a></b>.  Using the color chooser, you  can  pick  any
              color you like.

              As you can see from the syntax of the argument, the hash sign (<b>#</b>) is optional.  If you want to use
              the  hash  sign,  be  sure  to  place  the entire color specification in single or doubles quotes,
              because the hash sign can confuse some shells: they think the hash sign is the start of a comment,
              causing the rest of your command line to be ignored, causing an error because the <b>-b</b> will not have
              an argument in this case.

       <b>-a</b> <b>audio</b>
              Using this option, you may supply the filename of an audio file to use in the menu.  May be an MP3
              file, a WAV file or anything else that <b>mplayer</b> can play without needing extra options.

              If you use audio in the menu, this will open up the  possibility  of  using  animated  picture-in-
              picture  versions  of  the  movies in the menu (see the <b>-n</b> option below).  If you do not supply an
              audio file, this will not be possible to use animated  picture-in-picture  versions,  only  static
              images or no previews at all (again, see the <b>-n</b> option below).

       <b>-n</b> <b>animation</b>
              Using  this  option,  you  can  tell  the program what kind of menu you would like to create.  The
              possible arguments are <b>none</b> (which will cause a menu to be created that will have no  previews  of
              the  movies,  but  will  only display the background color/image, the titles of the movies and the
              navigation buttons), <b>static</b> (which will cause a menu to be created that  will  display  a  preview
              image  of each movie, but that is not animated) and <b>animated</b> (which is only possible if you supply
              an audio file using the <b>-a</b> option, see above, and which will cause a menu to be created that  will
              display picture-in-picture animated previews of the movies).

              If  you  don't  specify  this option, the default will be to use <b>animated</b> if you supplied an audio
              track to be used and <b>static</b> if there is no audio.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       If this program is called with a incorrect set of parameters, it will print a diagnostic message  telling
       the  user  what  went wrong.  Also, it will then print its usage information, listing all the options and
       their meanings.

       The program tells you what it is doing while it is running.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       The command line that I use most often is:

              <b>movie-make-title-simple</b> -o title -m pal \
                    -i <u>background.jpg</u> -s -a <u>nice_music.mp3</u>
