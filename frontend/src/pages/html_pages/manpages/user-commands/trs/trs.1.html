</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       trs - filter replacing strings

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>trs</b> [<b>-</b>[<b>r</b>]<b>e</b>] <b>'</b><u>REPLACE_THIS</u> <u>WITH_THAT</u> [<u>AND_THIS</u> <u>WITH_THAT</u>]...<b>'</b>
       <b>trs</b> [<b>-</b>[<b>r</b>]<b>f</b>] <u>FILE</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Copy  stdin  to  stdout  replacing  every occurrence of given strings with other ones. This is similar to
       <b><a href="../man1/tr.1.html">tr</a></b>(1), but replaces strings, not only single chars.

       Rules (separated by whitespace) can be given directly  after  <b>-e</b>  option,  or  can  be  read  from  <u>FILE</u>.
       Argument  not  preceded  by  <b>-e</b>  or  <b>-f</b>  is guessed to be a script when it contains some whitespace, or a
       filename otherwise.

       Comments are allowed from <b>#</b> until the end of line. The character <b>#</b> in strings must be specified as <b>\#</b>.

       Standard C-like escapes <b>\a</b> <b>\b</b> <b>\e</b> <b>\f</b> <b>\n</b> <b>\r</b> <b>\t</b> <b>\v</b> <b>\\</b> <b>\</b><u>nnn</u> are recognized. In addition,  <b>\s</b>  means  a  space
       character and <b>\!</b> means an empty string.

       Sets  of  acceptable  characters  at a given position can be specified between <b>\[</b> and <b>]</b>.  ASCII ranges in
       sets can be shortly written as <u>FIRST</u><b>-</b><u>LAST</u>.  When a set consists of only a single range, <b>\[</b> and <b>\]</b> can  be
       omitted.

       When  a  part  of  the  string  to translate is enclosed in <b>\{</b>...<b>\}</b>, only that part is replaced. Any text
       outside <b>\{</b>...<b>\}</b> serves as an assertion: a string is translated only if it is preceded by the  given  text
       and  followed  by  another  one.  <b>\{</b> at the beginning or <b>\}</b> at the end of the string can be omitted. Text
       outside <b>\{</b>...<b>\}</b> is treated as untranslated.

       Before the beginning of the file and after its end there are only <b>\n</b>'s.   Thus,  for  example,  <b>\n\{.\}\n</b>
       matches <b>.</b> on a line by itself, including the first line, and the last one even without the <b>\n</b> marker.

       A  fragment  of  the form <b>\?</b><u>x</u><b>=</b><u>N</u>, where <u>x</u> is a letter <b>A</b>-<b>Za</b>-<b>z</b> and <u>N</u> is a digit <b>0</b>-<b>9</b>, contained in the target
       text sets the variable <u>x</u> to the value <u>N</u> when that rule succeeds. Similar  fragment  in  the  source  text
       causes  the  given  rule  to be considered only if that variable has such value.  Initially all variables
       have the value of <b>0</b>.  Several assignments or conditions can be present in  one  rule  -  they  are  ANDed
       together.

   <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-e</b>     Give the translation rules directly in the command line.

       <b>-f</b>     Get them from the file specified.

       <b>-r</b>     Reverse  every  rule.  This  affects only the next <b>-e</b> or <b>-f</b> option. Of course this doesn't have to
              give the reverse translation! Any rule containing any of  <b>\{\}\[\]\{\}\-</b>  is  taken  in  only  one
              direction.  You  may  force  any rule to be taken in only one direction by enclosing the string to
              translate in <b>\{</b>...<b>\}</b>.

       <b>--help</b> display help and exit

       <b>--version</b>
              output version information and exit

       Multiple <b>-e</b> or <b>-f</b> options are allowed. All  rules  are  loaded  together  then,  and  earlier  ones  have
       precedence.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       $ echo Leeloo |trs -e 'el n e i i aqq o\}\n x o u'
       Linux

</pre><h4><b>DIFFERENCES</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>sed</b></h4><pre>
       The  main  difference  between <b>trs</b> and <b>sed</b> <b>'s///g;</b> ...<b>'</b> (excluding sed's regular expressions) is that sed
       takes every rule in the order specified and applies it to the whole line of translated file, whereas  trs
       examines  every  position and tries all rules in this place first. In sed every next rule is fed with the
       text produced by the previous one, whereas in trs every piece of text can be translated at most once  (if
       more  than  one  rule  matches at a given position, the one mentioned earlier wins). That's why sed isn't
       well suited for translating between character sets. On the other hand, tr translates only  single  bytes,
       so it can't be used for Unicode conversions, or TeX / SGML ways for specifying extended characters.

       Another example:
       $ echo 642 |trs -e '4 7 72 66 64 4'
       42
       $ echo 642 |sed 's/4/7/g; s/72/66/g; s/64/4/g'
       666

       The  string to replace can be empty; there must be something outside <b>\{\}</b> then. In this special case only
       one such create-from-nothing rule can success at a given position. For example, <b>\}\x80\-\xFF</b>  <b>@</b>  precedes
       every  character with high byte set with <b>@</b>.  The rule of the form <b>some\{</b> <b>thing</b> doesn't work at the end of
       a file.
