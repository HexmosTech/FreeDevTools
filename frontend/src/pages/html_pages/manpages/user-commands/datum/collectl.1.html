</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       collectl - Collects data that describes the current system status.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Record Mode - read data from live system and write to file or display on terminal

       <b>collectl</b> <b>[-f</b> <b>file]</b> <b>[options]</b>

       Playback Mode - read data from one or more raw data files and display on terminal

       <b>collectl</b> <b>-p</b> <b>file1</b> <b>[file2</b> <b>...]</b> <b>[options]</b>

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Record Mode

       In  this  mode data is taken from a <b>live</b> system and either displayed on the terminal or written to one or
       more files or a socket.

       <b>--align</b>
              If the HiRes modules is present, <b>collectl</b> sample monitoring will be aligned  such  that  a  sample
              will  always be taken at the top of a minute (this does NOT mean the first sample will occur then)
              so that all instances of collectl running on any systems which have their clocks synchronized will
              all take samples at the same time.  Furthermore, if one is doing process monitoring, those samples
              will also be taken at the top of the minute and so can delay the start of sampling up  to  2  full
              process monitoring intervals.

       <b>--all</b>
              Collect  summary  data for ALL subsystems except slabs, since slab monitoring requires a different
              monitoring interval.  This also means you won't get any detail data which also includes  processes
              and  environmementals.  You can use this switch anywhere -s can be used but not both together.  If
              the system supports lustre and/or interconnect monitoring those statistics will  be  provided  but
              the  warnings  produced  when  they  are  not available you try to select them with -s will not be
              displayed.

       <b>--ALL</b>
              This is actually a superset of --all by adding detail statistics as well with the exception of TCP
              details when displaying to a terminal since those are only available with -P or -f.

       <b>-A,</b> <b>--address</b> <b>address[:port[:timeout]]</b> <b>|</b> <b>server[:port]</b>
              In the first form, one specifies an address,  optional  port  and  timeout  (the  first  colon  is
              required  to  specify timeout for default port).  All data is then written to that socket prefaced
              with the current host name at the named address and port until the socket is closed, at which time
              collectl will exit.

              In the second form one enters the text "server" and optional port.  In this form, collectl runs as
              a server, waiting for a connection and once established writes  data  on  that  socket.   The  key
              difference  here  is  if  the  client  exists collectl keeps running and will again look for a new
              connection, allowing it to survive client restarts or crashes.

              The default port is set at 2655 but can be changed - see collectl.conf.

              In both forms, one can additionally request local data logging by specifying a combination  of  -P
              and -f.  See <b>man</b> <b>collectl-logging</b> for more details.

       <b>--comment</b> <b>string</b>
              Add  the  specified  string to the end of the headers in the data files. If any embedded spaces be
              sure to quote it.  This can be very useful when doing characterizations or benchmarking and you're
              frequently changing system/application parameters and restarting collectl between tests.

       <b>-C,</b> <b>--config</b> <b>filename</b>
              Name/location of the collectl  configuration  file.   If  not  specified,  <b>collectl</b>  searches  for
              <b>collectl.conf</b>  first  in <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a> (the default), then in the same directory the <b>collectl</b> executable is
              in, and finally the current working directory.

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--count</b> <b>Samples</b>
              The number of samples to record. This is one way of 3 ways of describing how long collectl  should
              run (see <b>-r</b> and <b>-R</b> ).  Note that these 3 switches are mutually exclusive.

       <b>-D,</b> <b>--daemon</b>
              Run  <b>collectl</b>  as a daemon, primarily used when starting as a service.  One caveat about this mode
              is you can only run one copy.

       <b>--export</b> <b>file[,options]</b>
              This requests that collectl does not print anything on the terminal (or send it to a socket) using
              the standard brief/verbose/plot formats.  Instead it executes a perl "require" on the named  file,
              using  an  extension  of  ph if not specified.  It first looks in the current directory and if not
              there the directory the executable is in.  It then calls the function "file"Init(options)  towards
              the beginning of collectl and again as simply  "file"(@options) to generate the exported formatted
              output.  See the online documentation on Exporting Custom Output and Logging for more details.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--filename</b> <b>Filename</b>
              This is the name of a file to write the output to.  For details on how the output files are named,
              see   the   <b>File</b>   <b>Naming</b>   section   of   the   documentation   on   collectl.sourceforge.net  OR
              /usr/share/doc/collectl/FileNaming.html

       <b>-F,</b> <b>--flush</b> <b>seconds</b>
              Flush output buffers after this number of seconds.  This is equivalent to issuing <b>kill</b> <b>-s</b> <b>USR1</b>  at
              the same frequency (but a lot easier!).  If 0, a flush will occur every data collection interval.

       <b>--grep</b> <b>pattern</b>
              The  main  purpose of this switch is for those users who have discovered there is some data in the
              raw files that never appears in any display and have taken to displaying it themselves with  grep.
              Unfortunately  this  method does not include timestamps and so makes it difficult to interpret the
              results.  Even if you include the timestamp from the file  it  is  in  UTC  and  so  needs  to  be
              translated to be of any real value.  This switch does just that and then some.

              Specifically,  it  allows  you  to playback a file and instead of processing it normally it simply
              searches for any entries that match the perl pattern and reports those lines  prefaced  with  time
              stamps.   You  can optionally change the time format with the usual -o options and can even select
              the timeframe with --from and --thru.

       <b>--home</b>
              Always start the display for the current interval at the top of the screen also known as the  home
              position  (non-plot format only).  This generates a real-time, continously refreshing display when
              the data fits on a single screen.

       <b>--import</b> <b>file1[,options][:file2[,options]...]</b>
              This loads the named files and executes  callbacks  to  them,  which  is  the  API  mechanism  for
              importing additional metrics into collectl.  See the webpage on the API for further detail.

              Since these files also include instructions for how to report the output in all the various forms,
              you  will  also  need  to  include  --import  during  playback.   Finally, since the default is to
              seamlessly include imported data with everything else  collectl  reports,  if  you  ONLY  want  to
              display  imported  data  you much explicitly deselect all other subsystems either by including -s-
              (note the trailing minus sign) followed by all the subsystems were recorded OR simply say -s-all.

       <b>-i,</b> <b>--interval</b> <b>interval[:interval2[:interval3]]</b>
              This is the sampling interval in seconds.  The default is 10 seconds when run as a  daemon  and  1
              second  otherwise.  The process subsystem and slabs (-sY and -sZ) are sampled at the lower rate of
              <b>interval2.</b>  Environmentals (-sE), which only apply  to  a  subset  of  hardware,  are  sampled  at
              <b>interval3.</b>   Both  <b>interval2</b>  and  <b>interval3,</b> if specified, must be an even multiple of <b>interval1.</b>
              The daemon default is -i10:60:300 and all other modes are -i1:60:300.  To  sample  only  processes
              once every 10 seconds use -i:10.

       <b>--nohup</b>
              Whenever collectl finishes a data collection interval, it checks to see if the starting parent has
              exited.   This is to prevent the case in which someone might start a copy of collectl and then the
              process dies and collectl keeps running.  If that is the behavior someone actually  intends,  they
              should start collectl with --nohup.

              NOTE - when running as a daemon, --nohup is implied.

       <b>--quiet</b>
              Whenever  collectl  wants  to  tell  the  user  something,  it  assigns  a  category to it such as
              Informational, Warning, Error or Fatal.  When run with -m, all messages are displayed for the user
              and if logging data to a file with -f, these messages are also sent to a log file which is in  the
              data  collection  directory  and  has  an  extenion  of  "log".   However,  if -m is not specified
              Informational messages (such as collectl starting or stopping) are not reported  on  the  terminal
              but  the  other  3  are.   Sometimes  the warnings can be annoying and one can suppress these with
              --quiet though they will still be written to the message log in -f.  You cannot suppress Error  or
              Fatal errors.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--rolllogs</b> <b>time[[,days[:months]][,minutes]]</b>
              When  selected,  collectl  runs  indefinately (or at least until the system reboots).  The maximum
              number of raw and/or plot files that will be retained (older ones are  automatically  deleted)  is
              controlled  by  the <b>days</b> field, the default is 7.  When -m is also specified to direct collectl to
              write messages to a log file in the logging directory, the number of months to retain  those  logs
              is  controlled  by  the  <b>months</b>  field  and  its default is 12.  The <b>increment</b> field which is also
              optional (but is position dependent) specifies the duration of an individual  collection  file  in
              minutes the default of which is 1440 or 1 day.

       <b>--rawdskfilt</b>
              This  switch  overrides the DiskFilter setting in collectl.conf and explicitly defines a perl regx
              expression against which records from /prod/diskstats are selected for processing.  When there are
              a lot of disks to process, this can be a handy way to reduce the  amount  of  data  collected  and
              actually  improve  performance  since  there are less patterns to match each input record against.
              Just remember that unlike --dskfilt which only filters during display, records filtered with  this
              switch are never even recorded and so lost forever.

              You  can  optionally specify your filter with a leading plus-sign which tells collectl to just add
              your filter to the default specification.  Care should  be  taken  here  as  longer  filters  will
              slightly increase overhead and with a lot of disks and/or shorter monitoring intervals can add up.

              As  a  side benefit of this switch, if you really want to look at partition level stats you can do
              so by leaving off the trailing space in the default pattern.

              One must be also be careful in selecting the correct pattern since it's easy to get it  wrong  and
              you  may  end  up collecting the WRONG data!  To verify you are collecting what you think you are,
              make a test run using -d4 to see the raw data being recorded in real-time.

       <b>--rawdskignore</b>
              This is the opposite of the rawdskfilt switch.  When specified any  disks  listed  are  completely
              ignored  and  will  not  appear in the raw file.  Typically this switch is useful when you're only
              interested in recording a subset of disk statistics.

       <b>--rawnetfilt</b>
              This works just like --rawdskfilt except it applies to networks.  Unlike disk filtering which  has
              an  explicit  default  pattern,  the default for network filtering is to simply record all network
              data from /proc/net/dev.

              The -d4 switch also works here, as well as everywhere,  to  see  the  raw  data  as  it  is  being
              collected.

       <b>--rawnetignore</b>
              This  is  the opposite of the rawnetfilt switch and works just like the rawdskignore switch.  When
              specified any networks listed are ignored and will not appear in the  raw  file.   Typically  this
              switch is useful when you're only interested in recording a subset of network statistics.

       <b>--rawtoo</b>
              Only  available  in  conjunction  with  -P, this switch causes the creation/logging of raw data in
              addition to plottable data.  While this may seem excessive, keep in  mind  that  unlike  plottable
              data, raw data can be played back with different switches potentially providing more details.  The
              overhead to write out this additional data is minimal, the only real cost being that of extra disk
              space.

       <b>-R,</b> <b>--runas</b> <b>uid[:gid]</b>
              This  switch only works when running in daemon mode and so must be specified in the DaemonCommands
              line.  Its presence will cause collectl to write the collectl.pid file into the same directory  as
              its  other  output files as specified by -f, since <a href="file:/var/run">/var/run</a> does not normally grant non-privileged
              users write access.  Furthermore, the  ownership  of  that  directory  must  match  the  specified
              ownership  since collectl needs to write ALL it's files to that directory and can no longer assume
              global permissions when run as root.

              This WILL also require manually modifying /etc/init.d/collectl to change the PIDFILE  variable  to
              point to the same directory which the -f switch in the DaemonCommands line of collectl.conf points
              to.

              As a final note of caution, since this mechanism changes where collectl reads/writes its pid file,
              once  you  start  using  --runas,  all  calls to run collectl as a daemon must use it or it may be
              confused and exhibit unpredictable behavior.

       <b>-R,</b> <b>--runtime</b> <b>duration</b>
              Specify the duration of data collection where the duration is a number followed by one  of  <b>wdhms,</b>
              indicating how many weeks, days, hours, minutes or seconds the collection is to be taken for.

       <b>--sep</b> <b>separator</b>
              Specify  the  plot  format  separator  -  default  is  a  space.  If this is a numeric field it is
              interpretted as the decimal value of  the  associated  ASCII  character  code.   Otherwise  it  is
              interpretted as the character itself.  In other words, "--sep :" sets the separator character to a
              colon and "--sep 9" sets it to a horizontal tab.  "--sep 58" would also set it to a colon.

       <b>--tworaw</b>
              The  switches  -G  and  --group  have  been replaced by --rawtoo, which is more rescriptive of its
              function.  When specified, it tells collectl to  treat  process  and  slab  data  as  an  entirely
              separate  group of raw files, named with the extention "rawp".  These separate files can be played
              back and processed just like any other collectl raw files and in fact one can even play back  both
              at the same time if that is what is desired.  The only real purpose of this switch is that on some
              systems  with  many processes, it is possible to generate huge raw files (some have been observerd
              to be &gt;250MB!) and while collectl will happily play back/process these files it can  take  a  long
              time.   By using the --tworaw switch one still gets a huge rawp file, but the normal raw file is a
              much more manageable size and as a result will faster to process then when all  data  is  combined
              into the same file.

       Playback Mode

       In this mode, data is read from one or more data files that were generated in Record Mode

       <b>--export</b> <b>Filename</b>
              When  playing  back  a file, use this switch to create an identical raw file differing only in the
              timeframe being convered, so naturally one must also include --from,  --thru  or  both.   Further,
              since the resultant file will contain the exact same raw data you cannot select a subset using -s.
              This  switch  is  actually  intended  for a support function for situations where somone is having
              problems playing back a file and a subset of the original raw file that covers  the  problem  time
              has been requested, hopefully allowing a significantly file to be posted or emailed.

       <b>--extract</b> <b>filename</b>
              If  specified, rather than actually play back the file specified with -p, ALL raw data between the
              date ranges is selected and a subset of that raw file created.  The rules for how to interpret the
              filename are the same as used for -f.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--filename</b> <b>filename</b>
              If specified, this is the name of a file or directory to write the  output  to  (rather  than  the
              terminal).   See  the  description  for details on the format of this field.  This requires the -P
              flag as well.

       <b>--from</b> <b>time</b> <b>range</b>
              Play back data starting with this time, which may optionally include  the  ending  time  as  well,
              which is of the format of [date:]time[-[date:]time].  The leading 0 of the hour is optional and if
              the seconds field is not specified is assumed to be 0.  If no dates specified the time(s) apply to
              each file specified by -P.  Otherwise the time(s) only apply to the first/last dates and any files
              between those dates will have all their data reported.

       <b>--full</b>
              Full  mode is actually a superset of --verbose and if selected will force --verbose.  It will also
              force the RECORD separator to be printed for every interval even if only a  single  subsystem  was
              requested  and  to  include  the  actual  subsystems  that follow following the utc timestamp as a
              parsing aid for those who may wish to parse the text output rather than the plot data.

       <b>--offsettime</b> <b>seconds</b>
              This field originally was used before collectl reported the  timezone  in  the  file  headers  and
              allowed  one  to  compensate.  Since then it is rarely needed except in two possible cases, one in
              which data on two systems is to be compared and they weren't synchonized with  ntp.   This  allows
              all  the  times  to be reported as shifted by some number of seconds.  The other case (and this is
              very rare) is when a clock had changed in the middle  of  a  sample  and  will  not  be  converted
              correctly.  When this happens one may have to play back the samples in pieces and manually set the
              time offset.

       <b>--passwd</b> <b>filename</b>
              When  reporting  usernames  associated  with  a  UID,  use  this  file  for  the mapping.  This is
              particularly important on systems running NIS where this are no user names in /etc/passwd.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--playback</b> <b>Filename</b>
              Read data from the specified <b>playback</b> file(s), noting that one can use wildcards in  the  filename
              if  quoted  (if playing back multiple files to the terminal you probably want to include -m to see
              the filenames as they are processed).  The filename must either end in <b>raw</b> or <b>raw.gz.</b>  As an added
              feature, since people sometimes automate the running of this option and don't want to hard code  a
              date,  you  can  specify  the  string YESTERDAY or TODAY and they will be replaced in the filename
              string by the appropriate date.

       <b>--pname</b> <b>name</b>
              By default, collectl uses the file /var/run/collectl.pid  to  indicate  the  pid  of  the  running
              instance  of  collectl and prevent multiple copies from being run.  If you DO want to run a second
              copy, this switch will cause collectl to change its process name to  collectl-name  and  use  that
              name as the associated pid file as well.

       <b>--procanalyze</b>
              When  specified  and  there is process data in the raw file, a summary file will be generated with
              one entry unique process containing such things as the  total  cpu  consumed  for  both  user  and
              system, min/max utilization of various memory types, total page faults and several others.

       <b>--slabanalyze</b>
              When  specified  and there is slab data in the raw file, a summary file will be generated with one
              entry unique slab containing data on physical memory usage by that slab.

       <b>--thru</b> <b>time</b>
              Time thru which to play back a raw file.  See --from for more

       Common Switches - both record and playback modes

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--debug</b> <b>debug</b>
              Control the level of debugging information, not typically used.  For details see the source code.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help,</b> <b>-x,</b> <b>--helpext,</b> <b>-X,</b> <b>--helpall</b>
              Display standard, extended help message (which doesn't  include  the  optional  displays  such  as
              --showoptions, --showsubsys, --showsubopts, --showtopopts) or everything.

       <b>--hr,</b> <b>--headerrepeat</b> <b>num</b>
              Sets  the  number  of  intervals to display data for before repeating the header.  A value -1 will
              prevent any headers from being displayed and a value of 0 will cause only a single  header  to  be
              displayed and never repeated.

       <b>--iosize</b>
              In brief mode, include iosize with disk, infiniband and network data.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--limits</b> <b>limit</b>
              Override  one  or more default exception limits.  If more than one limit they must be separated by
              hyphens.  Current values are:

              <b>SVC:value</b>
                     Report partition activity with Service times &gt;= 30 msec

              <b>IOS:value</b>
                     Report device activity with 10 or more reads or writes per second

              <b>LusKBS:value</b>
                     Report client or OSS activity greater than limit.  Only applies to Client  Summary  or  OSS
                     Detail reporting.  [default=100000]

              <b>LusReints:value</b>
                     Report  MDS activity with Reint greater than limit.  Only applies to MDS Summary reporting.
                     [default=1000]

              <b>AND</b>
                     Both the IOS and SCV limits must be reached before a  device  is  reported.   This  is  the
                     default value and is only included for completeness.

              <b>OR</b>
                     Report device activity if either IOS or SVC thresholds are reached.

              <b>-L,</b> <b>--lustsvcs</b> <b>[c|m|o][:seconds]</b>
                     This  switch limits which servics lustre checks for and the frequency of those checks.  For
                     more information see the man page collectl-lustre.

       <b>-m,</b> <b>--messages</b>
              Write status to a monthly log file in the same directory as the output file  (requires  -f  to  be
              specified  as  well).   The  name  of  the file will be <b>collectl-yyyymm.log</b> and will track various
              messages that may get generated during every run of <b>collectl.</b>

       <b>-N,</b> <b>--nice</b>
              Set priority to a <b>nicer</b> one of 10.

       <b>-o,</b> <b>--options</b> <b>Options</b>
              These apply to the way output is displayed OR written to a plot file.  They do not effect the  way
              data  is  selected  for recording.  Most of these switches work in both record as well as playback
              mode.  If you're not sure, just try it.

              <b>1</b>
                     Data in plotting format should use 1 decimal point of precision as appropriate.

              <b>2</b>
                     Data in plotting format should use 2 decimal points of precision as appropriate.

              <b>a</b>
                     Always append data to an existing plot file.   By  default  if  a  plot  file  exists,  the
                     playback  file will be skipped as a way of assuring it is associated with a single recorded
                     file.  This switch overrides that mechanism allowing muliple recorded files to be processed
                     and written to a single plot file.

              <b>c</b>
                     Always open newly named plot fies in <b>create</b> mode, overwriting any old ones that may already
                     exists.  If one processes multiple files for the same day in <b>append</b>  mode  multiple  times,
                     the same data will be appended to the same file mulitple times.  This assures a new file is
                     created at the start of the processing.

              <b>d</b>
                     For  use  with  terminal output and  brief mode.  Preceed each line with a date/time stamp,
                     the date being in mm/dd format.  This option can also be applied  to  plot  formatit  which
                     will cause the date portion to also be displayed in this format as opposed to D format.

              <b>D</b>
                     For use with terminal output and brief mode.  Preceed each line with a date/time stamp, the
                     date being in yyyymmdd format.

              <b>g</b>
                     For  use  with  terminal  output  and brief mode.   When displaying values of 1G or greater
                     there is limited precision for 1 digit values.  This options  provides  a  way  to  display
                     additional  digits  for more granularity by substituting a "g" for the decimal point rather
                     than the trailing "G".

              <b>G</b>
                     For use with terminal output and brief mode.  This is similar  to  "g"  but  preserves  the
                     trailing "G" by sacrificing a digit of granularity.

              <b>m</b>
                     Whenever  times are reported in plot format, in the normal terminal reporting format at the
                     bginning of each interval or when when one of the time reporting options (d, D, T or  U  is
                     selected), append the milliseconds to the time.

              <b>n</b>
                     Where appropriate, data such as disk KBs or transfers are normalized to units per second by
                     taking  the change in a counter and dividing by the number of seconds in that interval.  In
                     the case of CPUs, utilization (calculated in jiffies) is normalized as a percentage of  the
                     interval.

                     Normalization can be disabled via this option, the result being the reported values are not
                     divided  by  the  duration  of  the interval.  This can be particulary useful for reporting
                     values that are &lt; 1/2 the sampling, which will be rounded to 0.

              <b>T</b>
                     For use with terminal output and brief mode, preceeds each line with a time stamp.

              <b>u</b>
                     Create plot files with unique names by include the starting time  of  a  colletion  in  the
                     name.  This forces multiple collections taken the same day to be written to multiple files.

              <b>-U</b> <b>or</b> <b>--utc</b>
                     In plot format only, report timestamps in Coordinated Universal time which is more commonly
                     know as UTC.

              <b>x</b>
                     Report  only  exception records for selected subsystems.  Exception reporting also requires
                     --verbose.  Currently this only applies to disk detail and Lustre server information so one
                     must select at least -s D, l or L for this to apply.  If writing to  a  detail  file,  this
                     data  will go into a separate file with the extension <b>X</b> appended to the regular detail file
                     name.

              <b>X</b>
                     Report both exceptions as well as all details for selected subsystems, for -s  D,  l  or  L
                     only.

              <b>z</b>
                     If  the  compression  library  has  been  installed, all output files will be compressed by
                     default.  This switch tells collectl not to compress  any  plottable  files.   If  collectl
                     tries  to compress but cannot because the library hasn't been installed, it will generate a
                     warning which can be suppressed with this switch.

       <b>-P,</b> <b>--plot</b>
              Generate output in plot format.  This format is space separated data which consists  of  a  header
              (prefaced  with  a # for easy identification by an analysis program as well as identifying it as a
              comment for programs, such as gnuplot, which honor that convention).  When written to disk,  which
              is  the typical way this option is used, <b>summary</b> data elements are written to the <b>tab</b> file and the
              <b>detail</b> elements written to one or more files, one per detail subsystem.  If -f is  not  specified,
              all output is sent to the terminal.  Output is always one line per sampling interval.

       <b>--stats</b>
              This  switch will cause brief data to be reported as both totals and averages after processing one
              or more files for the same day or in playback mode.

       <b>--statopts</b> <b>option(s)</b>
              This switch controls the way brief stats are reported, the default is to report the  totals  once,
              at the end of a day's worth of raw files, if more than one.

              a - include averages along with totals
              i - include the interval data itself, which is the equivalent of -oA
              s - print summary stats at the end of each file processed even if more than one per day

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--subsys</b> <b>subsystem</b>
              This  field  controls  which  subsystem  data  is to be collected or played back.  The default for
              collecting data is "cdn", which stands for CPU, Disk and Network summary data and the default  for
              playback is everthing that was collected.

              The  rules  for displaying results vary depending on the type of data selected.  If you write data
              for CPUs and DISKs to a raw file and play it back with -sc, you will only see CPU  data.   If  you
              play  it  back  with  -scm  you  will still only see CPU data since memory data was not collected.
              However, when used with -P, collectl will always honor the subsystems specified with  this  switch
              so  in  the previous example you will see CPU data plus memory data of all 0s.  To see the current
              set of default subsystems, which are a subset of this full list, use -h.

              You can also use + or - to add or subtract subsystems to/from the default  values.   For  example,
              "-s-cdn+N"&lt;  will  remove  cpu, disk and network monitoring from the defaults while adding network
              detail.

              Refer to data definitions on the sourceforge website OR in /usr/share/collectl/doc/collectl-xxx to
              see complete descriptions of the data returned.

              SUMMARY SUBSYSTEMS

              b - buddy info (memory fragmentation)
              c - CPU
              d - Disk
              f - NFS V3 Data
              i - Inode and File System
              j - Interrupts
              l - Lustre
              m - Memory
              n - Networks
              s - Sockets
              t - TCP
              x - Interconnect
              y - Slabs (system object caches)

              DETAIL SUBSYSTEMS

              This is the set of <b>detail</b> data from which in most cases the corresponding summary data is derived.
              There are  currently  2  types  that  do  not  have  corresponding  summary  data  and  those  are
              "Environmental" and "Process".  So, if one has 3 disks and chooses <b>-sd,</b> one will only see a single
              total  taken  across all 3 disks.  If one chooses <b>-sD,</b> individual disk totals will be reported but
              no totals.  Choosing <b>-sdD</b> will get you both.

              C - CPU
              D - Disk
              E - Environmental data (fan, power, temp),  via ipmitool
              F - NFS Data
              J - Interrupts
              L - Lustre OST detail OR client Filesystem detail
              M - Memory node data, which is also known as numa data
              N - Networks
              T - 65 TCP counters only available in plot format
              X - Interconnect
              Y - Slabs (system object caches)
              Z - Processes

       <b>--showheader</b>
              In collectl mode this command will cause the header that is normally written to a data file to  be
              displayed  on  the  terminal  and  collectl  then  exists.  This can be a handy way to get a brief
              overview of the system configuration.

       <b>--showoptions</b>
              This command shows only the portion of the help text that desribes the -o and  --options  switches
              to save the time of wading through the entire help screen.

       <b>--showcolheaders</b>
              This  command  shows the first set of headers that will be printed by collectl and exits.  Doesn't
              really make sense for multi-section output like several sets of verbose or detail data.  Also note
              that since it requires one monitoring interval to build up some headers which may be  dynamic,  it
              also forces the interval to 0.

       <b>--showsubopts</b>
              List all the subsystem specifice options

       <b>--showtopopts</b>
              Show  all the different values for the --top type field, which specify the field(s) by to sort the
              data

       <b>--showrootslabs</b>
              This command only works on systems using the new slab allocator and will list the root name (these
              are those entries in /sys/slab which are not soft links) along with all its  alias  names.   If  a
              name doesn't have an alias, it will not appear in this report.

       <b>--showslabaliases</b>
              This  command  only  works on systems using the new slab allocator.  Like --showrootslabs, it will
              name a slab and all its aliases but rather than show the root slab name it will show  one  of  the
              aliases to provide a more meaningful name.  If there are any slabs that only have a single (or no)
              alias they will not be included in this report.

       <b>--showsubopts</b>
              Similar  to  --showoptions,  this  command  summaries  just  the paramaters associated with -O and
              --subopts.

       <b>--showsubsys</b>
              Yet another way to summare a portion of the help text, this command only shows valid subsystems.

       <b>--top</b> <b>[type][,num[,v]]</b>
              Include the top "num" consumers by resource for this interval.  The default number is  the  height
              of the window if it can be determined otherwise 24, and the default resource is the total cpu time
              which  is  taken as the sum of SysT and UsrT.  See --showtopopts for a list of other types of data
              you can sort on.

              This switch can also be used with -s in which case a portion of the window is reserved at the  top
              to  fill  in  the  subsystem  data,  which  is  currently in verbose mode though a brief format is
              contemplated for some time in the future.

              In interactive mode and if not specified, the process monitoring interval will be set to that  for
              other  subsystems.  The screen will be cleared for each interval resulting in a display similar to
              the "top" utility.  In playback more the screen will NOT be cleared.  You cannot use  this  switch
              in "record" mode.

              Finally, if v is specified as the 3rd parameter, the output scrolls vertically (like playbak mode)
              rather than clearing the screen between intervals.

       <b>--umask</b> <b>mask</b>
              Sets  collectl's umask to control output file permissions.  Only root can set the umask.  See "man
              umask" for details.

       <b>--utime</b> <b>mask</b>
              Write periodic micro-timestamps into raw file  at  different  points  in  time  for  fine  grained
              measurements of operation times.
              1 - write timestamps when entering major sections
              2 - write timestamps for all <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a> accesses except for process data
              4 - write timestamps for <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a> data for all processes including threads

       <b>-v</b>
              Show version and whether or not Compression and/or HiResTime modules have been installed and exit.

       <b>-V</b>
              Show default parmeter and control settings, all of which can be changed in /etc/collectl.conf

       <b>--verbose</b>
              Display  output  in  verbose  mode.  This often displays more data than in the default mode.  When
              displaying detail data, verbose mode is  forced.   Furthermore,  if  summary  data  for  a  single
              subsystem  is  to be displayed in verbose mode, the headers are only repeated occasionally whereas
              if multiple subsystems are involved each needs their own header.

       <b>-w</b>
              Disply data in <b>wide</b> mode.  When displaying data on the terminal, some data is  formatted  followed
              by  a  K, M or G as appropriate.  Selecting this switch will cause the full field to be displayed.
              Note that there is no attempt to align data with the column headings in this mode.

</pre><h4><b>SUBSYSTEM</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are subsystem specific and typically filter data for collection and/or  display  as
       well as affect the output format:

       <b>--cpufilt[^]perl-regx[,perl-regx...]</b>
              Works  the  same as dskfilt and netfilt, allows one to select a subset of CPUs.  These filters are
              also honored by interrupt reporting as well.

       <b>--cpuopts</b>
              z - only applies to cpu details, do not report any CPUs with no load.  In other words all  entries
              are zero except for IDLE.

       <b>--dskfilt</b> <b>[^]perl-regx[,perl-regx...]</b>
              NOTE  -  this  does  NOT effect data collection and ALL disk data will always be collected, unless
              --rawdskfilt is specified too.  However, only data for disk names that match the  pattern(s)  will
              be included in the summary totals and displayed when details are requested.  Alternatively, if you
              preface  the first expression with a caret, all names that match all strings will be excluded from
              the summary totals and detail displays rather then included.  If you don't know  perl,  a  partial
              string will usually work too.

              Just  remember,  this only applies to collected data and so if for example you specify a parition,
              such as sda1, you'll never see the data since it was filtered out at the time of data  collection.
              To see those stats you would need to say --rawdskfilt sda1.

       <b>--dskopts</b>
              f - report some columns as fractions for more precision on detail output
              i - display the i/o sizes in brief mode just like with --iosize
              o - exclude unused disks from new file headers and plot data
              z - only applies to disk details, do not report any lines with values of all zeros.

       <b>--dskremap</b> <b>aaa:bbb,ccc:ddd...</b>
              This  will  cause disk names matching the perl pattern aaa to be replaced with the string bbb.  In
              some cases, you may simply want to remove the entire string in which case the second string should
              be left empty.  If you want to remove a string container  a  /,  be  sure  to  escape  it  with  a
              backslash.

       <b>--envopts</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Options</b>
              The default is to display ALL data but the following will cause a subset to be displayed

              f - display fan data
              p - display current (power) data
              t - display temperature data
              C - convert temperature to Celcius if in Farenheit
              F - convert temperature to Farenheit if in Celcius
              M - display each type of data on separate line
              T  -  display data truncated to whole integers (some implemenations displayed them with fractional
              components)
              9 - any number, will tell ipmitool to read on this device number

       <b>--envfilt</b> <b>regx</b> If specified, this regx is evaluated against each line of data returned  by  ipmitool  and
       only those that match are retained.  All other data is lost.

       <b>--envremap</b> <b>perl-regx,...</b>
              If  specified  as  a comma separated list of perl regular substitution expressions without the =~s
              portion, each expression is applied to each environmental field  name,  thereby  allowing  one  to
              rename  the column headers.  This can be most useful when running on heterogeneuos systems and you
              want consistent column names.

       <b>--intfilt</b> <b>[^]perl-regx[,perl-regx...]</b>
              NOTE - this does NOT effect data  collection,   ALL  interrupt  data  will  always  be  collected.
              However, only data for interrupts that match the pattern(s) will be included in the summary totals
              and displayed when details are requested.  Alternatively, if you preface the first expression with
              a  caret,  all  names  that  match all strings will be excluded from the summary totals and detail
              displays rather then included.  If you don't know perl, a partial string will usually work too.

              NOTE - these expressions are applied to the entire line one sees  in  <a href="file:/proc/interrupts">/proc/interrupts</a>,  including
              the  interrupt  number, name and even counters so if you do want to include an interrupt number in
              the pattern be sure to include the trailing colon as well.

       <b>--lustopts</b> <b>Lustre</b> <b>Options</b>
              B - For clients and servers, show buffer stats
              D - For MDSs and OSTs AND running earlier versions of HPSFS, collect disk block iostats
              M - For clients, collect metadata
              O - For OSTs, show detail level stats
              R - For client, collect readahead stats

       <b>--memopts</b> <b>Memory</b> <b>Options</b>
              R - show memory values (including swap space) as rates of change as opposed  to  absolute  values.
              One can also show absolute changes between intervals by including -on.

       <b>--netfilt</b> <b>[^]perl-regx[,perl-regx...]</b>
              NOTE  - this does NOT effect data collection and ALL network data will always be collected, unless
              --rawnetfilt is specified too.  Also note that by default only eth, ib, em and p1p  networks  when
              present  are  included in the summary.  When this switch is specified, only data for network names
              that match the pattern(s) will  be  included  in  the  summary  and  displayed  when  details  are
              requested.   This  switch therefore also gives you the ability to add other, possibly new, network
              devices to the summary totals.

              Alternatively, if you preface the first expression with a caret, all names that match all  strings
              will  be  excluded from the summary totals and detail displays rather then included.  If you don't
              know perl, a partial string will usually work too.

       <b>--netopts</b>
              e - include network error counts in brief and explicit error types elsewhere
              E - only include lines with network errors in them
              i - include i/o sizes in brief mode
              o - exclude unused networks from new file headers and plot data
              w - set width of network device name

       <b>--nfsfilt</b> <b>NFS</b> <b>Filters</b>
              Specify one or more comma separated filters as a C/S followed by an nfs version  number  and  only
              those  will  have data reported on.  For example, C2 says to report data on V2 Clients.  As a data
              collection performance optimization, if one or  more  client  filters  are  specified,  data  will
              actually be collected for all clients as is also done for servers.

       <b>--nfsopts</b> <b>NFS</b> <b>Options</b> q.RS z - only display detail lines which have data

       <b>--procfilt</b> <b>Process</b> <b>Filters</b>
              These  filters  restrict  which  processes are selected for collection/display.  Using this filter
              will significanly reduce the load on process data collection since collectl creates a blacklist of
              those existing processes that do not pass the filter and so  are  permanently  excluded  from  any
              future processing.

              The  format of a filter is a one charter type followed by a match string.  Multiple filters may be
              specified if separated by commas.

              c - substring of the command being executed as explicitly read  from  /proc/pid/stat.   Note  that
              this  can actually be a perl expression, so if you want a command that ends in a particular string
              all you need to is append a \$ to the end of the string.  Otherwise it would  match  any  commands
              containing that string.
              C - any command that starts with the specified string
              f  -  full  path  of the command, including arguments, as read from /proc/pid/cmdline.  Like the c
              modifier this too can be a perl expression.
              p - pid
              P - parent pid
              u - any process ownerd by this user's UID or in the range specifide by uxxx-yyy
              U - any process owned by this username

              <b>caution:</b> the process names collectl  tries  to  match  with  c  and  C  is  the  second  field  in
              /proc/pid/stat  which  may not necessarily be what you think!  eg the name for X emacs is actually
              emacs-x

       <b>--procopts</b> <b>options</b>
              These options control the way data is displayed and can also improve data collection  performance

              c - include CPU time of children who have exited (same as ps -S)
              f - use cumulative totals for page faults in process data instead of rates
              i - show process I/O counters in display instead of default format
              I - disable collection of I/O counters, see note below
              k - remove known shells from process names, making it possible to see actual command
              m - show breakdown of memory utilization instead of default format
              p - never look for new pids or threads during data collection
              r - show root command name only (no directory) for narrower display. Note  that  this  is  applied
              AFTER  'k'  so  if arg1 becomes the new command it will be truncated now, which is very handy when
              running in a virtual python environment
              R - show ALL process priorities ('RT' currently displayed if realtime)
              s - show process start time in hh:mm:ss format
              S - show process start time in mmmdd-hh:mm:ss format
              t - include ALL process threads (increases collection overhead)
              u - report username as 12 chars instead of 8, noting uxx will cause column  width  to  be  xx  but
              cannot be less than 8
              w - widen display by including whole argument string, with optional max width
              x - include extended process attributes (currently only for context switches)
              z - exclude any processes with 0 in sort field (in --top mode)

              Process data is the most expensive type of data collected, costing as much as 3 times the CPU load
              as  all other types of data combined.  Collecting thread data makes this even more expensive.  One
              can significantly reduce this load by over 25 percent by disabling the collection  of  I/O  stats.
              However,  keep in mind that even if you don't try to optimize process data collection, the overall
              system load by collectl can still be on the order of about 0.2% when  running  as  a  daemon  with
              default  collection  rates.   See  the  online  documentation  on  measuring  performance for more
              information.

              A security hole was identified that allowed non-priviledged users to read /proc/pid/io  and  guess
              password  lengths  and  noe  many  distros retrict access to the owner or root.  As a result, non-
              priviledged users will see all 0 I/O counts for processes that  are  not  theirs  when  specifying
              --procopt i.

       <b>--slabfilt</b> <b>Slab</b> <b>Filters</b>
              One  can  specify  a list of slab names separated by commas and only those slabs whose names start
              with those strings will be listed or summaried.

       <b>--slabopts</b> <b>Slab</b> <b>Options</b>
              <b>s</b> <b>-</b> <b>exclude</b> <b>any</b> <b>slabs</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>0</b>
              <b>S</b> <b>-</b> <b>only</b> <b>show</b> <b>those</b> <b>slabs</b> <b>whose</b> <b>allocations</b> <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> <b>last</b> <b>display</b>

       <b>--tcpfilt</b>
              These filters actually control both what is collected as well as displayed.  If one  selects  non-
              collected  filters,  0s will be reported.  There is one special case and that is if one includes T
              (tcp extended stats) in the filter string, there are no brief ones and therefore --verbose will be
              forced.
              <b>i</b> <b>-</b> <b>ip</b> <b>stats</b>
              <b>t</b> <b>-</b> <b>tcp</b> <b>stats</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>collectl</b> utility is a system monitoring tool that records or displays specific operating system  data
       for  one or more sets of subsystems. Any set of the subsystems, such as CPU, Disks, Memory or Sockets can
       be included in or excluded from data collection.  Data can either be displayed back to the  terminal,  or
       stored  in  either a compressed or uncompressed data file. The data files themselves can either be in <b>raw</b>
       format (essentially a direct copy from the associated <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a> structures) or in a space separated <b>plottable</b>
       format such that it can be easily plotted using tools such as gnuplot or excel.  Data files can  be  read
       and manipulated from the command line, or through use of command scripts.

       Upon  startup,  <b>collectl.conf</b>  is  read,  which  sets  a  number of default parameters and switch values.
       Collectl searches for this file first in <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>, then in the directory  the  collectl  execuable  lives  in
       (typically  <a href="file:/usr/sbin">/usr/sbin</a>)  and  finally the current directory.  These locations can be overriden with the <b>-C</b>
       switch.  Unless you're doing something really  special,  this  file  need  never  be  touched,  the  only
       exception  perhaps  being  when choosing to run collectl as a service and you wish to change it's default
       behavior which is set by the DaemonCommand entry.

</pre><h4><b>RESTRICTIONS/PROBLEMS</b></h4><pre>
       Thread reporting currently only works with 2.6 kernels.

       The pagesize has been hardcoded for perl 5.6 systems to 4096 for IA32 and 16384 for all others.   If  you
       are  running  5.6  on a system with a different pagesize you will see incorrect SLAB allocation sizes and
       will need to scale the numbers you're seeing accordingly.

       I have recently discovered there is a bug in <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a> in that an extra line is occasionally  read  with  the
       end  of the previous buffer!  When this occurs a message is written (if -m enabled) and always written to
       the terminal.  Since this happens with a higher frequency with process data I silently  ignore  those  as
       the output can get pretty noisey.  If for any reason this is a problem, be sure to let me know.

       Since  collectl  has  no  control  over  the  frequency  at which data gets written to <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a>, one can get
       anomolous statistics as collectl is only reporting a snapshot  of  what  is  being  recorded.   For  more
       information see <a href="http://collectl.sourceforge.net/TheMath.html">http://collectl.sourceforge.net/TheMath.html</a>.

       At  least  one  network  card  occasionally generates erroneous network stats and to try to keep the data
       rational, collectl tries to detect this and when it does generates a message that  bogus  data  has  been
       detected.
