       <b>mineXpert</b>              —              Open mass spectrometric data files of a wide variety of formats and
       mine data graphically

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>minexpert</b> [<u>options]</u>  <u>[filename</u> <u>...]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the <b>mineXpert</b> software shipped within the <b>msXpertSuite</b> software suite.

       This program can be used to load mass spectrometry data files and show the spectral data in a plot widget
       for further analysis according to a variety of available integrations. While  this  program  can  operate
       integrally  in a graphical mode, it is also widely scriptable using JavaScript as a scripting language. A
       typical data mining session would involve the following steps/actions:

          •  Open a mass spectrometry file and immediately compute a TIC chromatogram, show that chromatogram in
             a dedicated window. If the data are from an ion mobility mass spectrometry experiment, compute a mz
             = f(dt) color map. The TIC chromatogram and the color map are then  the  starting  points  for  the
             mining of the data.

          •  Perform a wide variety of integrations to a mass spectrum or a drift spectrum. Each new spectrum is
             displayed  in  its  dedicated  window  (the TIC chromatogram window, the Color map window, the Mass
             spectrum window and the Drift spectrum window).  Each new plot (be it a TIC  chromatogram,  a  mass
             spectrum  or  a  drift  spectrum)  is  potentially  the  start of another integration such that the
             analysis can drill at each step further in the depth of the data.

          •  Perform isotopic cluster calculations and shape the obtained mass peak centroids into fully  shaped
             mass peaks (Gaussian or Lorentizan mathematical models).

          •  Each  plot  has specific functions associated to it: export as a (x,y) file, automatic recording of
             the relevant data of signalled peaks into a  file  using  a  specific  easy-to-understand  grammar,
             slicing of the data file into smaller data files.

          •  One  feature  of importance is the fact that a large part of the functionalities of the program are
             scriptable (JavaScript) and a powerful scripting console is available to elaborate  scripts  before
             storing them in script files to be automatically executed.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
