</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mpb-data - transformations of HDF5 files output by MPB

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mpb-data</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]... [<u>HDF5FILE</u>]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       mpb-data  is  a utility to perform additional processing and transformations of HDF5 files output by MPB,
       the MIT Photonic-Bands program.  In particular, it is designed  to  make  the  output  more  amenable  to
       visualization by reformatting it into a rectangular grid, extending it to multiple periods, and rescaling
       the data.

       MIT  Photonic  Bands  (MPB)  is  a free program to compute the band structures (dispersion relations) and
       electromagnetic modes of periodic dielectric structures.

       HDF5 is a free, portable binary format and supporting  library  developed  by  the  National  Center  for
       Supercomputing  Applications  at  the  University  of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign.  A single <u>h5</u> file can
       contain multiple data sets; by default, <u>mpb-data</u> operates on all of  the  MPB-produced  datasets  in  the
       file, but this can be changed via the <b>-d</b> option, or by using the syntax <u>HDF5FILE:DATASET</u>.

       <u>mpb-data</u>  writes its output datasets as additional datasets in the input file(s), with "-new" appended to
       the dataset names.  Alternatively, it can write its output to  a  separate  file,  specified  by  the  <b>-o</b>
       option.

       Note  also that, by default, the output datasets are identical to the input datasets; you must use one or
       more of the options below to specify a transformation (e.g. the <b>-r</b>/<b>-e</b> and <b>-n</b> options are very useful).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>     Display help on the command-line options and usage.

       <b>-V</b>     Print the version number and copyright info for mpb-data.

       <b>-v</b>     Verbose output.

       <b>-o</b> <u>file</u>
              Write output datasets to <u>file</u> (for the first input file only) rather than as  additional  datasets
              in the input file(s) (the default).

       <b>-r</b>     Output  a  rectangular  cell  with  the same volume as the cell of the input data.  This option is
              particularly useful for visualizing  data  from  non-orthogonal  unit  cells  (e.g.  a  triangular
              lattice),  as  otherwise  the  data  will appear skewed or warped in most graphics programs.  This
              option should almost always be accompanied by the <b>-n</b> option to ensure a uniform resolution.

       <b>-e</b> <u>x,y,z</u>
              As the <b>-r</b> option, but also make the first axis  of  the  output  along  the  <u>x,y,z</u>  direction  (in
              Cartesian coordinates) instead of along the first lattice vector as for <b>-r</b>.

       <b>-P</b> <u>phaseangle</u>
              For  complex-valued  datasets,  this  option  causes the output values to be rotated by <u>phaseangle</u>
              degrees in the complex plane.  That is, they are multiplied by exp(2 pi i <u>phaseangle</u> / 360).

       <b>-n</b> <u>n</u>   Output <u>n</u> grid points per lattice unit ("a").  This is useful not only for interpolating  to  finer
              (or  coarser) resolutions, but also to ensure that the resolution is uniform in each direction (to
              prevent the data from looking distorted when you visualize it).

       <b>-x</b> <u>mx</u>, <b>-y</b> <u>my</u>, <b>-z</b> <u>mz</u>
              This tells <u>mpb-data</u> to output multiple periods in the corresponding lattice directions.  to use  a
              particular  slice  of  a two- or three-dimensional dataset.  e.g.  <b>-x</b> <b>3.2</b> causes the output of 3.2
              periods in the first lattice direction.  The default is to output only a single period.

       <b>-m</b> <u>s</u>   Output <u>s</u> periods in each lattice direction; equivalent to: <b>-x</b> <u>s</u> <b>-y</b> <u>s</u> <b>-z</b> <u>s</u>.

       <b>-T</b>     The output has the first two dimensions (x and y) transposed.  This is useful in conjunction  with
              the parallel (MPI) version of MPB, which for performance reasons outputs all arrays with the first
              two dimensions transposed.  <b>-T</b> can undo this transposition.

       <b>-p</b>     Pixellized  output.  Normally, the input data is linearly interpolated to the output grid, but the
              <b>-p</b> option causes it to instead use the nearest grid point in the input data.  This is useful,  for
              example, if you want to study the discretization of the dielectric-function representation.

       <b>-d</b> <u>name</u>
              Use  dataset  <u>name</u>  from  the  input  files;  otherwise, the first dataset from each file is used.
              Alternatively, use the syntax <u>HDF5FILE:DATASET</u>, which allows you to specify  a  different  dataset
              for  each  file.   You can use the <u>h5ls</u> command (included with hdf5) to find the names of datasets
              within a file.

              Note that this option is generally unnecessary, since  mpb-data  can  already  find  the  relevant
              dataset(s)  for  files  created  by MPB.  Also, note that mpb-data treats the dataset specified by
              this option as a real scalar dataset and does not include the exp(ikx) factors when extending  the
              dataset to multiple periods.
