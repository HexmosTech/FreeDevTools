       pregap4 - prepare raw data from sequencing instruments for usage with gap4 (part of staden package)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Before  entry  into  a  gap4 database the raw data from sequencing instruments needs to be passed through
       several processes, such as screening for vectors, quality evaluation, and  conversion  of  data  formats.
       Pregap4  is  used  to  pass  a  batch of readings through these steps in an automatic way. It provides an
       interface for setting up and configuring the processing and for controlling the passage of  the  readings
       through  each  stage.  The  separate tasks are termed "modules" and each module is typically managed by a
       dedicated program. Pregap4 wraps all of these modules into a  single  easy  to  use  environment,  whilst
       maintaining  the  flexibility to select and extend the processing modules.  It is an, as yet, unpublished
       replacement of the program pregap Bonfield, J.K. and Staden, R. Experiment files  and  their  application
       during large-scale sequencing projects. DNA Sequence 6, 109-117 (1996).
