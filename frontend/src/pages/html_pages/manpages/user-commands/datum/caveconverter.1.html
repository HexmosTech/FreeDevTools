       caveconverter - convert cave survey data between formats

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>caveconverter</b> <u>infile</u> <u>outfile</u> <u>in_format</u> <u>out_format</u> <b>[</b> lrud <b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>caveconverter</b>  is a program for converting cave survey data from one format into another. It can read and
       write a variety of cave survey data file formats, translating the data, and can also generate  LRUD  info
       from splay shots.

   <b>Formats</b> <b>read:</b>
       Survex -  Supports  normal,  diving  and  nosurvey format data (in any supported units and field orders).
                 Multi-file reading now supported (but ignores FIX commands currently) (.svx files)

       Compass - The data file format generated by the Compass cave survey software. (.dat files)

       PocketTopo text export -
                 Text export option in PocketTopo menu. (.txt files)

       DXF -     Reads Lines and Polylines as survey centreline data. (.dxf files)

   <b>Formats</b> <b>written:</b>
       Toporobot -
              For using to import data into PocketTopo software on a PDA. (.text files)

       Survex -
              Converts to metric units currently, and entire series will be output in same field order (matching
              order of fields from last leg per series from input file). (.svx files)

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The format codes are:
       <b>c</b> <b>-</b> Compass
       <b>d</b> <b>-</b> DXF
       <b>p</b> <b>-</b> PocketTopo text export
       <b>s</b> <b>-</b> Survex
       <b>t</b> <b>-</b> Toporobot

       <b>lrud</b> <b>-</b> Adding the lrud flag to the end of the command  causes  LRUD  (left  rght  up  down)  info  to  be
              generated from splay data

</pre><h4><b>CONVERSION</b> <b>DETAILS</b></h4><pre>
       Converting  from  DXF  files  to survex shows how editable survey data can be regenerated from Survex .3d
       files via the Convert to DXF option provided by Survex

       This is also how you can generate a DXF file  to  convert  to  Toporobot  using  <b>caveconverter,</b>  enabling
       existing cave surveys to be imported into PocketTopo regardless of the original Survex format data. So if
       your  Survex  file is not readable by <b>caveconverter</b> (e.g. because it contains some unimplemented feature)
       then you can still process it using Survex to generate a 3d file and convert that to  DXF  using  Survex.
       Then  convert  it  to  Toporobot  format  using  caveconverter and import that file into PocketTopo. This
       enables existing surveys to be loaded into PocketTopo so that new data can be tied into the known cave on
       surveying trips.

       Converting Survex data to Toporobot will cause all the survey station numbers and  series  names  to  get
       regenerated,  unfortunately.  This  is because Toporobot format requires survey series to consist only of
       linear chains of survey stations. Junctions are not allowed in series.  This means that data  from  other
       formats  cannot  be  simply  converted,  so all stations are renumbered and reorganised into new numbered
       series to conform to this constraint of the Toporobot format.

       If you find files that give errors on conversion, send them to me (Footleg). I can be contacted by email:
       drfootleg [at] gmail.com

       While <b>caveconverter</b> can regenerate survey data files from DXF files generated from Survex
        .3d files, you will not get back the  complete  original  data.  What  you  do  get  is  the  equivalent
       calculated  survey  leg data (tape, compass, clino) for the positions of the stations in the DXF file. So
       any loop closure corrections and instrument calibrations will have already been applied to the data. This
       feature is really intended as a way to recover some sort of workable data when the original data has been
       lost and only the 3d files remain. Some small rounding errors occur during the Conversion to DXF from the
       .3d file, so the exact positions of survey stations and the cave length reported may differ by a  few  cm
       compared  to the original data. This is because in the DXF file, Survex has rounded all station positions
       to the nearest 1cm.

   <b>SPLAY/LRUD</b> <b>conversion</b>
       The original approach to reading splay legs from PocketTopo files in caveconverter was to treat  them  as
       just a way of measuring passage dimensions as Left, Right, Up, Down measurements at each station. So when
       no  more  than  four  splays were found at a station the code used their lengths as LRUD measurements and
       removed the splays from the data in the process. This kept Survex models looking like they used to before
       we started measuring lots of splays. But as my own surveying experience increased  over  recent  years  I
       realised that splays are a much more useful tool than just a way to take LRUD measurements. With a DistoX
       the  splays can quickly and accurately be fired from stations to pick out key features and passage shapes
       at corners and in chambers. These splays aid drawing the correct position of walls, ceiling and floor  as
       well as passage features. They are valuable data which should not be replaced with LRUD passage dimension
       data.  LRUD data still has value. A number of file formats support LRUD data to represent the position of
       passage walls at each station, and 3D model generation uses this data. But the  splays  should  still  be
       kept  when  generating LRUD data from them. The latest Aven viewer (part of the Survex 1.2.7 release) and
       the Loch Viewer (part of Therion) now both allow splay legs to be shown or hidden. So it is  possible  to
       view centreline only models without actually removing the splays from the data.

       So  this latest version of caveconverter no longer removes splay legs used to generate LRUD measurements.
       The LRUD generation code has also been completely rewritten and made part of the core data  model  rather
       than an operation done during reading of PocketTopo files. This means it is now possible to generate LRUD
       data  from  splays  in  any  data  file  which  can  be  read.  Unfortunately  for  those of you who used
       caveconverter in the past to convert PocketTopo data to Survex format it will have removed a lot  of  the
       splays,  so  you  will  want  to convert from the original PocketTopo exported text files again with this
       version. The LRUD generation does a much better job of selecting the best splay to  determine  a  passage
       dimension measurement from in this version of the code. The splay which contributes the greatest distance
       of  the  wall/ceiling/floor  from  the  station  is  used to calculate the distance to the wall. Previous
       versions of the code just used the total length of the best  splay,  rather  than  the  distance  in  the
       direction  of  the LRUD measurement being set. This was flawed and splays almost parallel to a survey leg
       could generate much larger passage dimension measurements than was appropriate. Now trigonometry is  used
       to  determine  the  appropriate distance in the direction of the passage dimension, and the direction for
       the left and right measurements is calculated from the best matching previous leg as well as  the  onward
       leg from the station.

       The  conversion of Survex data (containing splays) to Toporobot format in order to import existing survey
       data into PocketTopo to extend off on new survey trips  can  now  generate  and  output  LRUD  data  too.
       PocketTopo  will  display  this data as splays orthogonal to the direction of the survey legs to indicate
       passage width and height.

       Another bugbear of previous versions of caveconverter was that LRUD data was output in  Survex  files  as
       one  continuous block of stations with LRUD data, regardless of how the stations were connected by survey
       legs. This has now been fixed so the survey legs in each series are used to  determine  the  grouping  of
       passage data stations into blocks of connected stations.

   <b>Convert</b> <b>existing</b> <b>survey</b> <b>data</b> <b>for</b> <b>loading</b> <b>into</b> <b>PocketTopo</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>PDA</b>
       To  load  an  existing  survey into PocketTopo on a PDA in order to extend a survey with reference to the
       existing data for the cave, you can convert to Toporobot format using the caveconverter. Then import  the
       Toporobot  file into PocketTopo on the PDA. The input survey data could be read from a Compass file, or a
       Survex file. Where a Survex file contains formats which caveconverter is not yet able to  read,  you  can
       instead process the data in Survex to generate a .3d file, and then use Survex convert this to a DXF file
       (right-click  on  a  .3d  file  to  select  this  option  from the pop-up menu in Windows Explorer). Cave
       Converter can then read this DXF file and generate a Toporobot file. Converting survey data to  Toporobot
       will  unfortunately  cause all the survey station numbers and series names to be changed. This is because
       Toporobot format requires survey series to consist only of linear chains of  survey  stations.  Junctions
       are  not  allowed in these chains, so junctions in the cave require a new chain to be started. This means
       that data from other formats cannot be simply converted, so all stations  are  renumbered  and  organised
       into new numbered series to conform to these constraints of the Toporobot format.

   <b>Regenerate</b> <b>Editable</b> <b>Survey</b> <b>Data</b> <b>from</b> <b>DXF</b> <b>or</b> <b>Survex</b> <b>3D</b> <b>Files</b>
       Sometimes  the  survey  data  for  a  project  from  the past has been lost, and all that remains is some
       processed output. caveconverter can regenerate editable survey data  from  DXF  files  where  the  survey
       centreline  is  represented  by  straight line objects or polylines. This includes DXF files generated by
       Survex from Survex .3d files. The Aven viewer in Survex can export a DXF  file  from  a  cave  model,  or
       right-click on a .3d file in Windows Explorer to select the Convert to DXF option from the pop-up menu.

       While  caveconverter can regenerate survey data files from DXF files generated from Survex .3d files, you
       will not get back the complete original data. What you do get is the  equivalent  calculated  survey  leg
       data  (tape,  compass,  clino)  for  the  positions  of the stations in the DXF file. So any loop closure
       corrections and instrument calibrations will have already been applied  to  the  data.  This  feature  is
       really  intended  as a way to recover some sort of workable data when the original data has been lost and
       only the 3d files remain. Some small rounding errors occur during the Conversion  to  DXF  from  the  .3d
       file,  so  the  exact  positions  of  survey stations and the cave length reported may differ by a few cm
       compared to the original data. This is because in the DXF file, Survex has rounded all station  positions
       to the nearest 1cm.

   <b>Survex</b> <b>to</b> <b>Survex</b> <b>with</b> <b>LRUD</b> <b>generation</b>
       caveconverter can create LRUD passage data blocks for Survex files containing splays. Just read and write
       Survex  format,  using  the  LRUD option. The Survex file reader in caveconverter does not currently read
       existing passage data blocks. So be aware that existing passage data blocks will be removed if  a  Survex
       file  is read in and written out again. However if the Survex file contains splays and the lrud option is
       specified on the command line (or the Generate LRUD option  is  run  after  loading  the  data  into  the
       windowed  application)  then  new  passage  data blocks will be generated from the splays and replace any
       previously present passage data blocks in the output file.

   <b>Specifying</b> <b>Character</b> <b>Set</b> <b>Encoding</b>
       If you are reading in data files which contain extended character set symbols (e.g.  accented  characters
       or non-punctuation symbol characters) then caveconverter will assume these files are using UTF-8 encoding
       by  default.  To  specify a different encoding in the Windows application you can edit the app.properties
       file. (This file is written to the same folder as  the  CaveConverterGUI.jar  file  when  you  close  the
       application. So run the application once and close it, then you should find the app.properties file which
       will  contain  the  line  'character.set=UTF8'.  Edit  this  line to specify an alternative character set
       encoding if you are not using UTF-8. See the command  line  reference  html  page  for  more  details  on
       alternative character set codes, and also how to specify them for command line conversions.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To convert existing Survex data into Toporobot format so you can import it in to PocketTopo:
       <b>caveconverter</b> <b>survexfile.svx</b> <b>output.text</b> <b>s</b> <b>t</b>

       To convert data exported from PocketTopo into Survex format, including LRUD info from splays:
       <b>caveconverter</b> <b>pdaexport.txt</b> <b>survexfile.svx</b> <b>p</b> <b>s</b> <b>lrud</b>

       To convert data from DXF format into Toporobot format so you can import it into PocketTopo:
       <b>caveconverter</b> <b>datafile.dxf</b> <b>toporobotfileout.text</b> <b>d</b> <b>t</b>

       To convert data from DXF format into Survex format:
       <b>caveconverter</b> <b>datafile.dxf</b> <b>survexfile.svx</b> <b>d</b> <b>s</b>

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Survex  output  re-uses 'to station' numbers for splay legs if all splays from a station are not together
       in the file. So if a set of splay legs occur in a series of legs within the same begin/end block followed
       by a leg from a different station, and then another splay leg from the original station is found  further
       down  the block then the 'to station' numbering will start from 'a' again. So you can for example get two
       splays from station 10 with to station names of '10a' in the file. The file can be processed but shows  a
       large  loop  closure error for the splays as it equates the two 10a stations at the end of the two splays
       as being the same point.
