</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pkgdata</b> takes a set of data files and packages them for use by ICU or  applications  that  use  ICU.  The
       typical  reason  to package files using <b>pkgdata</b> is to make their distribution easier and their loading by
       ICU faster and less consuming of limited system resources such as file descriptors.  Packaged  data  also
       allow  applications  to  be  distributed with fewer resource files, or even with none at all if they link
       against the packaged data directly.

       <b>pkgdata</b> supports a few different methods of packaging data that serve different purposes.

       The default packaging <u>mode</u> is <b>common</b>, or <b>archive</b>.  In this mode, the different  data  files  are  bundled
       together  as an architecture-dependent file that can later be memory mapped for use by ICU. Data packaged
       using this mode will be looked up under the ICU data  directory.  Such  packaging  is  easy  to  use  for
       applications  resource  bundles, for example, as long as the application can install the packaged file in
       the ICU data directory.

       Another packaging mode is the <b>dll</b>, or <b>library</b>, mode, where the data files  are  compiled  into  a  shared
       library.  ICU used to be able to dynamically load these shared libraries, but as of ICU 2.0, such support
       has been removed. This mode is still useful for two main purposes: to build ICU itself, as the  ICU  data
       is  packaged  as  a  shared  library  by  default;  and  to build resource bundles that are linked to the
       application that uses them. Such resource bundles can then be placed anywhere where the system's  dynamic
       linker  will  be  looking  for  shared  libraries,  instead  of  being forced to live inside the ICU data
       directory.

       The <b>static</b> packaging mode is similar to the shared library one except that it produces a static library.

       Finally, <b>pkgdata</b> supports a <b>files</b> mode which simply copies the data files instead of packaging them as  a
       single  file  or  library.  This mode is mainly intended to provide support for building ICU before it is
       packaged as separate small packages for distribution with operating systems such as Debian GNU/Linux  for
       example.  Please  refer  to  the  packaging  documentation  in  the  ICU  source distribution for further
       information on the use of this mode.

       <b>pkgdata</b> builds, packages, installs, or cleans the appropriate data based on the options given without the
       need to call GNU <b>make</b> anymore.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>, <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print help about usage and exit.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Display extra informative messages during execution.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--copyright</b>
              Include a copyright notice in the binary data.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--comment</b> <u>comment</u>
              Includes the specified <u>comment</u> in the resulting data instead of the ICU copyright notice.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--mode</b> <u>mode</u>
              Set the packaging <u>mode</u> to be used by <b>pkgdata</b>.  The different modes and their meaning are explained
              in the <b>DESCRIPTION</b> section above. The valid mode names are <b>common</b> (or <b>archive</b>), <b>dll</b> (or  <b>library</b>),
              and <b>files</b>.

       <b>-O</b>, <b>--bldopt</b> <u>options</u>
              Specify options for the builder. The builder is used internally by <b>pkgdata</b> to generate the correct
              packaged  file.  Such  options  include, but are not limited to, setting variables used by <b><a href="../man1/make.1.html">make</a></b>(1)
              during the build of the packaged file. Note: If <b>icu-config</b> is available, then this option  is  not
              needed.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--name</b> <u>name</u>
              Set  the packaged file name to <u>name</u>.  This name is also used as the default entry point name after
              having been turned into a valid C identifier.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--entrypoint</b> <u>name</u>
              Set the data entry point (used for linking against the data in a shared  library  form)  to  <u>name</u>.
              The default entry point name is the name set by the <b>-n</b>, <b>--name</b> option.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--revision</b> <u>version</u>
              Enable  versioning of the shared library produced in <b>dll</b>, or <b>library</b>, mode. The version number has
              the format <u>major</u>.<u>minor</u>.<u>patchlevel</u> and all parts except for <u>major</u> are optional. If  only  <u>major</u>  is
              supplied then the version is assumed to be <u>major</u>.0 for versioning purposes.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--rebuild</b>
              Force the rebuilding of all data and their repackaging.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--install</b>
              Install  the packaged file (or all the files in the <b>files</b> mode). If the variable <b>DESTDIR</b> is set it
              will be used for installation.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--sourcedir</b> <u>source</u>
              Set the source directory to <u>source</u>.  The default source directory is the current directory.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--destdir</b> <u>destination</u>
              Set the destination directory to <u>destination</u>.  The default destination directory  is  the  current
              directory.

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--tempdir</b> <u>directory</u>
              Set  the directory used to generate temporary files to <u>directory</u>.  The default temporary directory
              is the same as the destination directory as set by the <b>-d</b>, <b>--destdir</b> option.
