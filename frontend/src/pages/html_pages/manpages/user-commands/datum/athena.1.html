</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       athena - interactive XAS data processing

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>athena</b>  file<u>...</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manpage documents the <b>athena</b> program, for interactive XAS data processing, including converting raw
       data to mu(E), aligning, merging, deglitching, Fourier transforming, and plotting.  Basically, <b>Athena</b>  is
       intended  to  handle  all  chores  involving  XAS  data  except  for  quantitative analysis by fitting to
       theoretical standards.  <b>Athena</b>'s sister program <b>Artemis</b> is the fitting program.

       <b>Athena</b> has two interesting and unusual features.  The first is that there are no buttons  for  explicitly
       removing  the  background  from mu(E) data or for performing Fourier transforms.  The only active buttons
       displayed on the main window are for plotting.  <b>Athena</b> always  knows  when  data  requires  a  background
       removal or a Fourier transform and will perform the necessary analysis steps before displaying the plot.

       The  second  interesting  feature  is  that it is just as easy to perform analysis and plotting chores on
       multiple data sets as on an individual data set.  <b>Athena</b> automates the most common data processing chores
       and automatically generates plots of one or more data sets.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Athena</b> is a graphical and interactive program written in the perl  programming  language,  using  the  Tk
       display  engine,  the  IFEFFIT  EXAFS library, and the PGPLOT plotting library.  (See below for a list of
       relevant URLs.)

       When <b>Athena</b> starts, you are presented with a window whose layout looks something like this:

              +----------------------------------------+
              |    menubar                             |

              |                           |   Group    |
              |     Group                 |   List     |

              |                           +------------+

              |                           |   Plot     |
              |                           |  Features  |
              |                           |            |
              |                           |            |
              +---------------------------+------------+
              |    echo area                           |
              +----------------------------------------+

       As you import data into <b>Athena</b>, <u>data</u> <u>groups</u> are created and  those  groups  are  listed  in  the  section
       labeled  `Group  List'  .   You select a group as the active one by clicking the left mouse button on its
       entry in the group list.  When selected, the list entry is highlighted with an orange background and  the
       parameters  associated  with  that  group  are  displayed  in  the  large area on the left labeled `Group
       Parameters'.  When you pass the mouse over a label in the group parameters section, you will notice  that
       the  label  changes color.  This indicates that a mouse click on the label will have an effect.  Clicking
       the left mouse button will display a hint in the echo area as to the function of that parameter.  See the
       section on group operations for the effect of a right mouse click.

       The view of the group parameters is replaced when certain features of <b>Athena</b> are used.  Choosuing any  of
       the  options  from the Data, Align, Diff, or Analysis menus will temporarily replace the group parameters
       with views of parameters relevant to the chosen task.  For example, when the log-ratio option  is  chosen
       from  the  Analysis menu, the view of group parameters is replaced by a view of the interface to <b>Athena</b>'s
       log-ratio/phase-difference analysis.

       Below the group list are two rows of button for plotting data.  The red  buttons  are  for  plotting  the
       selected  data  group.   The  purple  buttons  are  for plotting multiple data groups.  These buttons are
       labeled according to the data space of the plot.  <u>E</u>, <u>k</u>, <u>R</u>, and <u>q</u> refer to <u>energy</u>, <u>photoelectron</u>  <u>k</u>,  <u>real</u>
       <u>space</u> <u>R</u>, and <u>backtransform</u> <u>k</u>, respectively.

       Below the plot buttons are a set of tabs for specifying the details of the plots in each space.  For each
       space  you  can specify the range of the x-axis.  For energy plots, you can select whether the background
       function is plotted along with the data and whether the data and background are normalized.  For  k-space
       plots,  you can select the amount of k-weighting.  For R- and q-space plots, you can select which part of
       those complex functions are plotted.   There  are  also  tabs  for  setting  up  stacked  plots  and  for
       establishing plot indicators.  For a complete discussion see the section on plotting.

       Finally,  at the bottom of the page is the <u>echo</u> <u>area</u>.  <b>Athena</b> uses this area to display hints, brief help
       messages, warnings, and updates about recently performed analysis or plotting actions.  A few features of
       <b>Athena</b> will prompt the user for a text string.   In  those  situations,  the  echo  area  is  temporarily
       replaced by text string dialog.

       Throughout <b>Athena</b> the right mouse button serves to post <u>context</u> <u>sensitive</u> <u>menus</u>.  These include parameter
       labels,  groups  list entries, and other elements on the screen.  You should try clicking the right mouse
       button in different places to see what usefuls things might pop up.

</pre><h4><b>MISSING</b> <b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       You betcha!  Lots!  Here's a partial list:

       *   Principal Component Analysis on the set of marked groups

       *   XANES analysis by fitting a sum of scans to an unknown

       *   Dead-time and self-absorption corrections

       *   Handle dispersive data sets, i.e. data sets wherein the I0 and IT measurements are in  separate  data
           files becuase the data were obtained sequentially

       *   Calibrate dispersive data to a trusted standard

       *   Handle  SPEC  files.  An  independent  perl  module  would  be  ideal.  This  is a project some eager
           contributor could tackle without having to delve into ATHENA's source code.

       *   Alignment of scans using a reference, either of the same edge or of a nearby edge. (Any  suggestions?
           I am lacking a good idea about how to implement this...)

       *   Formulas for the energy axis (useful for converting encoder readings to energy values)

       *   R and q space records, that is to be able to read and write data in R and q space just as easily as E
           or k space.

       *   Internationalization. That is, build a framework for having text strings read from external files and
           for the language to be a configuration option.

       *   Documentation, documentation, documentation

       qualities for a data analysis program!

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This program requires no options.
