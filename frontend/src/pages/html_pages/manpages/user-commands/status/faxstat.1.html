</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       faxstat - display <u>HylaFAX</u> status

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>faxstat</b> [ <u>options</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>faxstat</u>  reports  the status of <u>HylaFAX</u> servers, including (potentially) the status of the send, receive,
       done, document, and archive directories.  When invoked without options <u>faxstat</u> reports only the status of
       the server; the options described below can be used to override this behaviour.

       Server status information indicates the state of the server (idle, sending,  receiving,  etc.)   and  the
       phone number that is associated with the fax modem.

       The job queue report give the status of facsimile jobs queued for transmission; by default:

       •  the job identifier,

       •  the job state (see below for the description of the <b>a</b> format in the <b>JobFmt</b> string),

       •  the modem or modem class the job is bound to (``any'' if the job can be sent though any modem),

       •  the destination (phone number) of the job,

       •  the time to send the job, or a blank field if the job is being processed or is to be sent immediately,

       •  the job's owner,

       •  and status information about the job (typically the reason why a previous attempt failed).

       The receive queue report lists the facsimile documents that have been received and are awaiting delivery;
       by default it includes:

       •  the document protection mode,

       •  the number of pages,

       •  the document's owner,

       •  the phone number of the sender (if supplied),

       •  the date and time at which the job was received, and

       •  the filename of the document in the <b>recvq</b> directory on the server machine.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b>        Display the contents of the <b>archive</b> directory on the server machine

       <b>-d</b>        Display  the  status  of  all  jobs  that  have completed; i.e. those jobs located in the <b>doneq</b>
                 directory on the server  machine.   The  <b>JobFmt</b>  string  defines  the  content  and  format  of
                 information reported with this option.

       <b>-f</b>        Display  the status of document files located in the <b>docq</b> directory on the server machine.  The
                 <b>FileFmt</b> string defines the content and format of information reported  with  this  option  (see
                 below).

       <b>-g</b>        Display times and dates in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).  NB: <u>this</u> <u>is</u> <u>the</u> <u>default</u>.

       <b>-h</b> <u>host</u>   Report  the status of the server on a specific <u>host</u>.  The <u>host</u> may be either a symbolic name or
                 a network address.  If no <b>-h</b>  option  is  supplied,  <u>faxstat</u>  uses  the  FAXSERVER  environment
                 variable  to identify the <u>HylaFAX</u> server to contact.  If this variable is not set, then <u>faxstat</u>
                 checks for a setting in the configuration files (first in the per-user file  and  then  in  the
                 system-wide file).  If all of the above fails, then <u>faxstat</u> attempts to contact a server on the
                 machine where it is run.

       <b>-i</b>        Display     additional     status     information     for    the    server    as    given    by
                 <b>/var/spool/hylafax/status/any.info.</b>  This status typically has information such as the  <u>HylaFAX</u>
                 version,  the  physical  location  of the server machine, and an administrative contact for the
                 server.  See <u><a href="../man5/status.5.html">status</a></u>(5).

       <b>-l</b>        Display times and dates in the local timezone of the server.

       <b>-r</b>        Display the receive queue status for each server.  The <b>RcvFmt</b> string defines  the  content  and
                 format of information reported with this option (see below).

       <b>-s</b>        Display  the status of jobs in the send queue on the server machine.  The <b>JobFmt</b> string defines
                 the content and format of information reported with this option (see below).

       <b>-v</b>        Trace the protocol exchanges between <u>faxstat</u> and the <u>hfaxd</u> processes on the standard output.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>faxstat</u> reads configuration information from the file  <b>/etc/hylafax/hyla.conf</b>  and  then  from  the  file
       <b><a href="file:~/.hylarc">~/.hylarc</a></b>.   Configuration  files  follow  the conventions described in <u><a href="../man1/hylafax-client.1.html">hylafax-client</a></u>(1).  The following

                     The <b>K</b> format produces: ``D'' if ECM is to be disabled, `` '' (space) if ECM use is enabled,
                     ``H'' if T.30 Annex C half duplex is enabled, or ``F'' if  T.30  Annex  C  full  duplex  is
                     enabled.

                     The  <b>N</b>  format  produces:  `` '' (space) if the system-wide tagline format is to be used or
                     ``P'' if a private tagline format is to be used.

                     The <b>O</b> format produces: ``N'' if no continuation cover page is to be used or ``  ''  (space)
                     if the system default handling for continuation cover pages is to be used.

                     The <b>X</b> format produces: ``F'' for a facsimile job or ``P'' for a pager job.

                     The  <b>a</b>  format  produces:  ``?'' for a job in an undefined state, ``T'' for a suspended job
                     (not being scheduled), ``P'' for a pending job (waiting for its time to  send  to  arrive),
                     ``S''  for a sleeping job (waiting for a scheduled timeout such as a delay between attempts
                     to send), ``B'' for a job blocked by concurrent activity to the same destination, ``W'' for
                     a job waiting for resources such as a free modem, ``R'' for a job that is actively running,
                     and ``D'' for a job that is done and was a  success.   ``F''  for  a  job  that  failed  to
                     complete.

                     The  <b>h</b>  format  produces:  ``D'' if page chopping is disabled, `` '' (space) for the system
                     default page chop handling, ``A'' when all pages are to be chopped, or ``L''  if  only  the
                     last page is to be chopped.

                     The  <b>n</b>  format  produces:  `` '' (space) when no notification messages are to be delivered,
                     ``D'' when notification is to be sent when the job is done, ``Q'' when notification  is  to
                     be  sent each time the job is requeued, or ``A'' when notification is to be sent for either
                     the job completing or being requeued.

                     It is recommended that all items include a field width so that the width  of  column  title
                     strings can be constrained when constructing headers from the format string.

       <b>ModemFmt</b>      The  format  string  to use when returning modem status information.  Formats are specified
                     using <u><a href="../man3S/printf.3S.html">printf</a></u>(3S)-style conventions but using the field identifiers listed below.  Each item
                     can include field width, precision, left-justification, 0-filling, etc. just as for <u>printf</u>;
                     e.g. %-8h for an 8-character wide, left-justified, blank-padded field containing  the  name
                     of the host the server is running on.

                     <b>Format</b>    <b>Description</b>
                     h         Server hostname

                     t         Server and session tracing levels (xxxxx:yyyyy)
                     v         Modem speaker volume as one-character symbol
                     z         A ``*'' if a <u><a href="../man8/faxgetty.8.html">faxgetty</a></u>(8) process is running; otherwise `` '' (space)

       <b>PassiveMode</b>
                 Whether or not to use passive mode in communication with the server.

       <b>Port</b>          The network port to contact for service.  (Equivalent to the <b>-h</b> option.)

       <b>Protocol</b>      The name of the communication protocol to use when contacting a server.  (Equivalent to the
                     <b>FAXSERVICE</b> environment variable.)

       <b>RcvFmt</b>        The  format string to use when returning status information for the <b>-r</b> option.  Formats are
                     specified using <u><a href="../man3S/printf.3S.html">printf</a></u>(3S)-style conventions but using the field identifiers listed  below.
                     Each  item  can include field width, precision, left-justification, 0-filling, etc. just as
                     for <u>printf</u>; e.g. %-3b for a 3-character wide, left-justified, blank-padded field containing
                     the signalling rate.

                     <b>Format</b>    <b>Description</b>
