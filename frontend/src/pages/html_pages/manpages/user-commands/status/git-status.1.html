</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       git-status - Show the working tree status

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>git</u> <u>status</u> [&lt;options&gt;] [--] [&lt;pathspec&gt;...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Displays paths that have differences between the index file and the current HEAD commit, paths that have
       differences between the working tree and the index file, and paths in the working tree that are not
       tracked by Git (and are not ignored by <b><a href="../man5/gitignore.5.html">gitignore</a></b>(5)). The first are what you <u>would</u> commit by running <b>git</b>
       <b>commit</b>; the second and third are what you <u>could</u> commit by running <u>git</u> <u>add</u> before running <b>git</b> <b>commit</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -s, --short
           Give the output in the short-format.

       -b, --branch
           Show the branch and tracking info even in short-format.

       --show-stash
           Show the number of entries currently stashed away.

       --porcelain[=&lt;version&gt;]
           Give the output in an easy-to-parse format for scripts. This is similar to the short output, but will
           remain stable across Git versions and regardless of user configuration. See below for details.

           The version parameter is used to specify the format version. This is optional and defaults to the
           original version <u>v1</u> format.

       --long
           Give the output in the long-format. This is the default.

       -v, --verbose
           In addition to the names of files that have been changed, also show the textual changes that are
           staged to be committed (i.e., like the output of <b>git</b> <b>diff</b> <b>--cached</b>). If <b>-v</b> is specified twice, then
           also show the changes in the working tree that have not yet been staged (i.e., like the output of <b>git</b>
           <b>diff</b>).

       -u[&lt;mode&gt;], --untracked-files[=&lt;mode&gt;]
           Show untracked files.

           The mode parameter is used to specify the handling of untracked files. It is optional: it defaults to
           <u>all</u>, and if specified, it must be stuck to the option (e.g.  <b>-uno</b>, but not <b>-u</b> <b>no</b>).

           The possible options are:

           •   <u>no</u> - Show no untracked files.

           •   <u>normal</u> - Shows untracked files and directories.

           •   <u>all</u> - Also shows individual files in untracked directories.

           When <b>-u</b> option is not used, untracked files and directories are shown (i.e. the same as specifying
           <b>normal</b>), to help you avoid forgetting to add newly created files. Because it takes extra work to find
           untracked files in the filesystem, this mode may take some time in a large working tree. Consider
           enabling untracked cache and split index if supported (see <b>git</b> <b>update-index</b> <b>--untracked-cache</b> and <b>git</b>
           <b>update-index</b> <b>--split-index</b>), Otherwise you can use <b>no</b> to have <b>git</b> <b>status</b> return more quickly without
           showing untracked files. All usual spellings for Boolean value <b>true</b> are taken as <b>normal</b> and <b>false</b> as
           <b>no</b>.

           The default can be changed using the status.showUntrackedFiles configuration variable documented in
           <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1).

       --ignore-submodules[=&lt;when&gt;]
           Ignore changes to submodules when looking for changes. &lt;when&gt; can be either "none", "untracked",
           "dirty" or "all", which is the default. Using "none" will consider the submodule modified when it
           either contains untracked or modified files or its HEAD differs from the commit recorded in the
           superproject and can be used to override any settings of the <u>ignore</u> option in <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1) or
           <b><a href="../man5/gitmodules.5.html">gitmodules</a></b>(5). When "untracked" is used submodules are not considered dirty when they only contain
           untracked content (but they are still scanned for modified content). Using "dirty" ignores all
           changes to the work tree of submodules, only changes to the commits stored in the superproject are
           shown (this was the behavior before 1.7.0). Using "all" hides all changes to submodules (and
           suppresses the output of submodule summaries when the config option <b>status.submoduleSummary</b> is set).

       --ignored[=&lt;mode&gt;]
           Show ignored files as well.

           The mode parameter is used to specify the handling of ignored files. It is optional: it defaults to
           <u>traditional</u>.

           The possible options are:

           •   <u>traditional</u> - Shows ignored files and directories, unless --untracked-files=all is specified, in
               which case individual files in ignored directories are displayed.

           •   <u>no</u> - Show no ignored files.

           •   <u>matching</u> - Shows ignored files and directories matching an ignore pattern.

           When <u>matching</u> mode is specified, paths that explicitly match an ignored pattern are shown. If a
           directory matches an ignore pattern, then it is shown, but not paths contained in the ignored
           directory. If a directory does not match an ignore pattern, but all contents are ignored, then the
           directory is not shown, but all contents are shown.

       -z
           Terminate entries with NUL, instead of LF. This implies the <b>--porcelain=v1</b> output format if no other
           format is given.

       --column[=&lt;options&gt;], --no-column
           Display untracked files in columns. See configuration variable <b>column.status</b> for option syntax.
           <b>--column</b> and <b>--no-column</b> without options are equivalent to <u>always</u> and <u>never</u> respectively.

       --ahead-behind, --no-ahead-behind
           Display or do not display detailed ahead/behind counts for the branch relative to its upstream
           branch. Defaults to true.

       --renames, --no-renames
           Turn on/off rename detection regardless of user configuration. See also <b><a href="../man1/git-diff.1.html">git-diff</a></b>(1) <b>--no-renames</b>.

       --find-renames[=&lt;n&gt;]
           Turn on rename detection, optionally setting the similarity threshold. See also <b><a href="../man1/git-diff.1.html">git-diff</a></b>(1)
           <b>--find-renames</b>.

       &lt;pathspec&gt;...
           See the <u>pathspec</u> entry in <b><a href="../man7/gitglossary.7.html">gitglossary</a></b>(7).

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       The output from this command is designed to be used as a commit template comment. The default, long
       format, is designed to be human readable, verbose and descriptive. Its contents and format are subject to
       change at any time.

       The paths mentioned in the output, unlike many other Git commands, are made relative to the current
       directory if you are working in a subdirectory (this is on purpose, to help cutting and pasting). See the
       status.relativePaths config option below.

   <b>Short</b> <b>Format</b>
       In the short-format, the status of each path is shown as one of these forms

           XY PATH
           XY ORIG_PATH -&gt; PATH

       where <b>ORIG_PATH</b> is where the renamed/copied contents came from. <b>ORIG_PATH</b> is only shown when the entry is
       renamed or copied. The <b>XY</b> is a two-letter status code.

       The fields (including the <b>-</b>&gt;) are separated from each other by a single space. If a filename contains
       whitespace or other nonprintable characters, that field will be quoted in the manner of a C string
       literal: surrounded by ASCII double quote (34) characters, and with interior special characters
       backslash-escaped.

       There are three different types of states that are shown using this format, and each one uses the <b>XY</b>
       syntax differently:

       •   When a merge is occurring and the merge was successful, or outside of a merge situation, <b>X</b> shows the
           status of the index and <b>Y</b> shows the status of the working tree.

       •   When a merge conflict has occurred and has not yet been resolved, <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b> show the state introduced
           by each head of the merge, relative to the common ancestor. These paths are said to be <u>unmerged</u>.

       •   When a path is untracked, <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b> are always the same, since they are unknown to the index. ?? is
           used for untracked paths. Ignored files are not listed unless <b>--ignored</b> is used; if it is, ignored
           files are indicated by !!.

       Note that the term <u>merge</u> here also includes rebases using the default <b>--merge</b> strategy, cherry-picks, and
       anything else using the merge machinery.

       In the following table, these three classes are shown in separate sections, and these characters are used
       for <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b> fields for the first two sections that show tracked paths:

       •   ' ' = unmodified

       •   <u>M</u> = modified

       •   <u>T</u> = file type changed (regular file, symbolic link or submodule)

       •   <u>A</u> = added

       •   <u>D</u> = deleted

       •   <u>R</u> = renamed

       •   <u>C</u> = copied (if config option status.renames is set to "copies")

       •   <u>U</u> = updated but unmerged

           X          Y     Meaning
           -------------------------------------------------
                    [AMD]   not updated
           M        [ MTD]  updated in index
           T        [ MTD]  type changed in index
           A        [ MTD]  added to index
           D                deleted from index
           R        [ MTD]  renamed in index
           C        [ MTD]  copied in index
           [MTARC]          index and work tree matches
           [ MTARC]    M    work tree changed since index
           [ MTARC]    T    type changed in work tree since index
           [ MTARC]    D    deleted in work tree
                       R    renamed in work tree
                       C    copied in work tree
           -------------------------------------------------
           D           D    unmerged, both deleted
           A           U    unmerged, added by us
           U           D    unmerged, deleted by them
           U           A    unmerged, added by them
           D           U    unmerged, deleted by us
           A           A    unmerged, both added
           U           U    unmerged, both modified
           -------------------------------------------------
           ?           ?    untracked
           !           !    ignored
           -------------------------------------------------

       Submodules have more state and instead report

       •   <u>M</u> = the submodule has a different HEAD than recorded in the index

       •   <u>m</u> = the submodule has modified content

       •   <u>?</u>  = the submodule has untracked files

       This is since modified content or untracked files in a submodule cannot be added via <b>git</b> <b>add</b> in the
       superproject to prepare a commit.

       <u>m</u> and <u>?</u> are applied recursively. For example if a nested submodule in a submodule contains an untracked
       file, this is reported as <u>?</u> as well.

       If -b is used the short-format status is preceded by a line

           ## branchname tracking info

   <b>Porcelain</b> <b>Format</b> <b>Version</b> <b>1</b>
       Version 1 porcelain format is similar to the short format, but is guaranteed not to change in a
       backwards-incompatible way between Git versions or based on user configuration. This makes it ideal for
       parsing by scripts. The description of the short format above also describes the porcelain format, with a
       few exceptions:

        1. The user’s color.status configuration is not respected; color will always be off.

        2. The user’s status.relativePaths configuration is not respected; paths shown will always be relative
           to the repository root.

       There is also an alternate -z format recommended for machine parsing. In that format, the status field is
       the same, but some other things change. First, the <u>-&gt;</u> is omitted from rename entries and the field order
       is reversed (e.g <u>from</u> <u>-&gt;</u> <u>to</u> becomes <u>to</u> <u>from</u>). Second, a NUL (ASCII 0) follows each filename, replacing
       space as a field separator and the terminating newline (but a space still separates the status field from
       the first filename). Third, filenames containing special characters are not specially formatted; no
       quoting or backslash-escaping is performed.

       Any submodule changes are reported as modified <b>M</b> instead of <b>m</b> or single ?.

   <b>Porcelain</b> <b>Format</b> <b>Version</b> <b>2</b>
       Version 2 format adds more detailed information about the state of the worktree and changed items.
       Version 2 also defines an extensible set of easy to parse optional headers.

       Header lines start with "#" and are added in response to specific command line arguments. Parsers should
       ignore headers they don’t recognize.

       <b>Branch</b> <b>Headers</b>

           If <b>--branch</b> is given, a series of header lines are printed with information about the current branch.

               Line                                     Notes
               ------------------------------------------------------------
               # branch.oid &lt;commit&gt; | (initial)        Current commit.
               # branch.head &lt;branch&gt; | (detached)      Current branch.
               # branch.upstream &lt;upstream-branch&gt;      If upstream is set.
               # branch.ab +&lt;ahead&gt; -&lt;behind&gt;           If upstream is set and
                                                        the commit is present.
               ------------------------------------------------------------

       <b>Stash</b> <b>Information</b>

           If <b>--show-stash</b> is given, one line is printed showing the number of stash entries if non-zero:

               # stash &lt;N&gt;

       <b>Changed</b> <b>Tracked</b> <b>Entries</b>

           Following the headers, a series of lines are printed for tracked entries. One of three different line
           formats may be used to describe an entry depending on the type of change. Tracked entries are printed
           in an undefined order; parsers should allow for a mixture of the 3 line types in any order.

           Ordinary changed entries have the following format:

               1 &lt;XY&gt; &lt;sub&gt; &lt;mH&gt; &lt;mI&gt; &lt;mW&gt; &lt;hH&gt; &lt;hI&gt; &lt;path&gt;

           Renamed or copied entries have the following format:

               2 &lt;XY&gt; &lt;sub&gt; &lt;mH&gt; &lt;mI&gt; &lt;mW&gt; &lt;hH&gt; &lt;hI&gt; &lt;X&gt;&lt;score&gt; &lt;path&gt;&lt;sep&gt;&lt;origPath&gt;

               Field       Meaning
               --------------------------------------------------------
               &lt;XY&gt;        A 2 character field containing the staged and
                           unstaged XY values described in the short format,
                           with unchanged indicated by a "." rather than
                           a space.
               &lt;sub&gt;       A 4 character field describing the submodule state.
                           "N..." when the entry is not a submodule.
                           "S&lt;c&gt;&lt;m&gt;&lt;u&gt;" when the entry is a submodule.
                           &lt;c&gt; is "C" if the commit changed; otherwise ".".
                           &lt;m&gt; is "M" if it has tracked changes; otherwise ".".
                           &lt;u&gt; is "U" if there are untracked changes; otherwise ".".
               &lt;mH&gt;        The octal file mode in HEAD.
               &lt;mI&gt;        The octal file mode in the index.
               &lt;mW&gt;        The octal file mode in the worktree.
               &lt;hH&gt;        The object name in HEAD.
               &lt;hI&gt;        The object name in the index.
               &lt;X&gt;&lt;score&gt;  The rename or copy score (denoting the percentage
                           of similarity between the source and target of the
                           move or copy). For example "R100" or "C75".
               &lt;path&gt;      The pathname.  In a renamed/copied entry, this
                           is the target path.
               &lt;sep&gt;       When the `-z` option is used, the 2 pathnames are separated
                           with a NUL (ASCII 0x00) byte; otherwise, a tab (ASCII 0x09)
                           byte separates them.
               &lt;origPath&gt;  The pathname in the commit at HEAD or in the index.
                           This is only present in a renamed/copied entry, and
                           tells where the renamed/copied contents came from.
               --------------------------------------------------------

           Unmerged entries have the following format; the first character is a "u" to distinguish from ordinary
           changed entries.

               u &lt;XY&gt; &lt;sub&gt; &lt;m1&gt; &lt;m2&gt; &lt;m3&gt; &lt;mW&gt; &lt;h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;path&gt;

               Field       Meaning
               --------------------------------------------------------
               &lt;XY&gt;        A 2 character field describing the conflict type
                           as described in the short format.
               &lt;sub&gt;       A 4 character field describing the submodule state
                           as described above.
               &lt;m1&gt;        The octal file mode in stage 1.
               &lt;m2&gt;        The octal file mode in stage 2.
               &lt;m3&gt;        The octal file mode in stage 3.
               &lt;mW&gt;        The octal file mode in the worktree.
               &lt;h1&gt;        The object name in stage 1.
               &lt;h2&gt;        The object name in stage 2.
               &lt;h3&gt;        The object name in stage 3.
               &lt;path&gt;      The pathname.
               --------------------------------------------------------

       <b>Other</b> <b>Items</b>

           Following the tracked entries (and if requested), a series of lines will be printed for untracked and
           then ignored items found in the worktree.

           Untracked items have the following format:

               ? &lt;path&gt;

           Ignored items have the following format:

               ! &lt;path&gt;

       <b>Pathname</b> <b>Format</b> <b>Notes</b> <b>and</b> <b>-z</b>

           When the <b>-z</b> option is given, pathnames are printed as is and without any quoting and lines are
           terminated with a NUL (ASCII 0x00) byte.

           Without the <b>-z</b> option, pathnames with "unusual" characters are quoted as explained for the
           configuration variable <b>core.quotePath</b> (see <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1)).

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The command honors <b>color.status</b> (or <b>status.color</b> — they mean the same thing and the latter is kept for
       backward compatibility) and <b>color.status.</b><u>&lt;slot&gt;</u> configuration variables to colorize its output.

       If the config variable <b>status.relativePaths</b> is set to false, then all paths shown are relative to the
       repository root, not to the current directory.

       If <b>status.submoduleSummary</b> is set to a non zero number or true (identical to -1 or an unlimited number),
       the submodule summary will be enabled for the long format and a summary of commits for modified
       submodules will be shown (see --summary-limit option of <b><a href="../man1/git-submodule.1.html">git-submodule</a></b>(1)). Please note that the summary
       output from the status command will be suppressed for all submodules when <b>diff.ignoreSubmodules</b> is set to
       <u>all</u> or only for those submodules where <b>submodule.</b><u>&lt;name&gt;</u><b>.ignore=all</b>. To also view the summary for ignored
       submodules you can either use the --ignore-submodules=dirty command line option or the <u>git</u> <u>submodule</u>
       <u>summary</u> command, which shows a similar output but does not honor these settings.

</pre><h4><b>BACKGROUND</b> <b>REFRESH</b></h4><pre>
       By default, <b>git</b> <b>status</b> will automatically refresh the index, updating the cached stat information from
       the working tree and writing out the result. Writing out the updated index is an optimization that isn’t
       strictly necessary (<b>status</b> computes the values for itself, but writing them out is just to save
       subsequent programs from repeating our computation). When <b>status</b> is run in the background, the lock held
       during the write may conflict with other simultaneous processes, causing them to fail. Scripts running
       <b>status</b> in the background should consider using <b>git</b> <b>--no-optional-locks</b> <b>status</b> (see <b><a href="../man1/git.1.html">git</a></b>(1) for details).

</pre><h4><b>UNTRACKED</b> <b>FILES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>PERFORMANCE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>git</b> <b>status</b> can be very slow in large worktrees if/when it needs to search for untracked files and
       directories. There are many configuration options available to speed this up by either avoiding the work
       or making use of cached results from previous Git commands. There is no single optimum set of settings
       right for everyone. We’ll list a summary of the relevant options to help you, but before going into the
       list, you may want to run <b>git</b> <b>status</b> again, because your configuration may already be caching <b>git</b> <b>status</b>
       results, so it could be faster on subsequent runs.

       •   The <b>--untracked-files=no</b> flag or the <b>status.showUntrackedFiles=no</b> config (see above for both):
           indicate that <b>git</b> <b>status</b> should not report untracked files. This is the fastest option.  <b>git</b> <b>status</b>
           will not list the untracked files, so you need to be careful to remember if you create any new files
           and manually <b>git</b> <b>add</b> them.

       •   <b>advice.statusUoption=false</b> (see <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1)): setting this variable to <b>false</b> disables the warning
           message given when enumerating untracked files takes more than 2 seconds. In a large project, it may
           take longer and the user may have already accepted the trade off (e.g. using "-uno" may not be an
           acceptable option for the user), in which case, there is no point issuing the warning message, and in
           such a case, disabling the warning may be the best.

       •   <b>core.untrackedCache=true</b> (see <b><a href="../man1/git-update-index.1.html">git-update-index</a></b>(1)): enable the untracked cache feature and only
           search directories that have been modified since the previous <b>git</b> <b>status</b> command. Git remembers the
           set of untracked files within each directory and assumes that if a directory has not been modified,
           then the set of untracked files within has not changed. This is much faster than enumerating the
           contents of every directory, but still not without cost, because Git still has to search for the set
           of modified directories. The untracked cache is stored in the <b>.git/index</b> file. The reduced cost of
           searching for untracked files is offset slightly by the increased size of the index and the cost of
           keeping it up-to-date. That reduced search time is usually worth the additional size.

       •   <b>core.untrackedCache=true</b> and <b>core.fsmonitor=true</b> or <b>core.fsmonitor=</b><u>&lt;hook-command-pathname&gt;</u> (see <b><a href="../man1/gitupdate-index.1.html">git-</a></b>
           <b><a href="../man1/gitupdate-index.1.html">update-index</a></b>(1)): enable both the untracked cache and FSMonitor features and only search directories
           that have been modified since the previous <b>git</b> <b>status</b> command. This is faster than using just the
           untracked cache alone because Git can also avoid searching for modified directories. Git only has to
           enumerate the exact set of directories that have changed recently. While the FSMonitor feature can be
           enabled without the untracked cache, the benefits are greatly reduced in that case.

       Note that after you turn on the untracked cache and/or FSMonitor features it may take a few <b>git</b> <b>status</b>
       commands for the various caches to warm up before you see improved command times. This is normal.
