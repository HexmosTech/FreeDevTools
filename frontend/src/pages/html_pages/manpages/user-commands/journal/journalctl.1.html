</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       journalctl - Print log entries from the systemd journal

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>journalctl</b> [OPTIONS...] [MATCHES...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>journalctl</b> is used to print the log entries stored in the journal by <b><a href="../man8/systemd-journald.service.8.html">systemd-journald.service</a></b>(8) and
       <b><a href="../man8/systemd-journal-remote.service.8.html">systemd-journal-remote.service</a></b>(8).

       If called without parameters, it will show the contents of the journal accessible to the calling user,
       starting with the oldest entry collected.

       If one or more match arguments are passed, the output is filtered accordingly. A match is in the format
       "FIELD=VALUE", e.g.  "_SYSTEMD_UNIT=httpd.service", referring to the components of a structured journal
       entry. See <b><a href="../man7/systemd.journal-fields.7.html">systemd.journal-fields</a></b>(7) for a list of well-known fields. If multiple matches are specified
       matching different fields, the log entries are filtered by both, i.e. the resulting output will show only
       entries matching all the specified matches of this kind. If two matches apply to the same field, then
       they are automatically matched as alternatives, i.e. the resulting output will show entries matching any
       of the specified matches for the same field. Finally, the character "+" may appear as a separate word
       between other terms on the command line. This causes all matches before and after to be combined in a
       disjunction (i.e. logical OR).

       It is also possible to filter the entries by specifying an absolute file path as an argument. The file
       path may be a file or a symbolic link and the file must exist at the time of the query. If a file path
       refers to an executable binary, an "_EXE=" match for the canonicalized binary path is added to the query.
       If a file path refers to an executable script, a "_COMM=" match for the script name is added to the
       query. If a file path refers to a device node, "_KERNEL_DEVICE=" matches for the kernel name of the
       device and for each of its ancestor devices is added to the query. Symbolic links are dereferenced,
       kernel names are synthesized, and parent devices are identified from the environment at the time of the
       query. In general, a device node is the best proxy for an actual device, as log entries do not usually
       contain fields that identify an actual device. For the resulting log entries to be correct for the actual
       device, the relevant parts of the environment at the time the entry was logged, in particular the actual
       device corresponding to the device node, must have been the same as those at the time of the query.
       Because device nodes generally change their corresponding devices across reboots, specifying a device
       node path causes the resulting entries to be restricted to those from the current boot.

       Additional constraints may be added using options <b>--boot</b>, <b>--unit=</b>, etc., to further limit what entries
       will be shown (logical AND).

       Output is interleaved from all accessible journal files, whether they are rotated or currently being
       written, and regardless of whether they belong to the system itself or are accessible user journals. The
       <b>--header</b> option can be used to identify which files <u>are</u> being shown.

       The set of journal files which will be used can be modified using the <b>--user</b>, <b>--system</b>, <b>--directory=</b>, and
       <b>--file=</b> options, see below.

       All users are granted access to their private per-user journals. However, by default, only root and users
       who are members of a few special groups are granted access to the system journal and the journals of
       other users. Members of the groups "systemd-journal", "adm", and "wheel" can read all journal files. Note
       that the two latter groups traditionally have additional privileges specified by the distribution.
       Members of the "wheel" group can often perform administrative tasks.

       The output is paged through <b>less</b> by default, and long lines are "truncated" to screen width. The hidden
       part can be viewed by using the left-arrow and right-arrow keys. Paging can be disabled; see the
       <b>--no-pager</b> option and the "Environment" section below.

       When outputting to a tty, lines are colored according to priority: lines of level ERROR and higher are
       colored red; lines of level WARNING are colored yellow; lines of level NOTICE are highlighted; lines of
       level INFO are displayed normally; lines of level DEBUG are colored grey.

       To write entries <u>to</u> the journal, a few methods may be used. In general, output from systemd units is
       automatically connected to the journal, see <b><a href="../man8/systemd-journald.service.8.html">systemd-journald.service</a></b>(8). In addition, <b><a href="../man1/systemd-cat.1.html">systemd-cat</a></b>(1) may
       be used to send messages to the journal directly.

</pre><h4><b>SOURCE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options control where to read journal records from:

       <b>--system</b>, <b>--user</b>
           Show messages from system services and the kernel (with <b>--system</b>). Show messages from service of
           current user (with <b>--user</b>). If neither is specified, show all messages that the user can see.

           The <b>--user</b> option affects how <b>--unit=</b> arguments are treated. See <b>--unit=</b>.

           Note that <b>--user</b> only works if persistent logging is enabled, via the <u>Storage=</u> setting in
           <b><a href="../man5/journald.conf.5.html">journald.conf</a></b>(5).

           Added in version 205.

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--machine=</b>
           Show messages from a running, local container. Specify a container name to connect to.

           Added in version 209.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--merge</b>
           Show entries interleaved from all available journals, including remote ones.

           Added in version 190.

       <b>-D</b> <u>DIR</u>, <b>--directory=</b><u>DIR</u>
           Takes a directory path as argument. If specified, journalctl will operate on the specified journal
           directory <u>DIR</u> instead of the default runtime and system journal paths.

           Added in version 187.

       <b>-i</b> <u>GLOB</u>, <b>--file=</b><u>GLOB</u>
           Takes a file glob as an argument. If specified, journalctl will operate on the specified journal
           files matching <u>GLOB</u> instead of the default runtime and system journal paths. May be specified
           multiple times, in which case files will be suitably interleaved.

           Added in version 205.

       <b>--root=</b><u>ROOT</u>
           Takes a directory path as an argument. If specified, <b>journalctl</b> will operate on journal directories
           and catalog file hierarchy underneath the specified directory instead of the root directory (e.g.
           <b>--update-catalog</b> will create <u>ROOT</u><a href="file:/var/lib/systemd/catalog/database">/var/lib/systemd/catalog/database</a>, and journal files under
           <u>ROOT</u>/run/journal/ or <u>ROOT</u><a href="file:/var/log/journal/">/var/log/journal/</a> will be displayed).

           Added in version 201.

       <b>--image=</b><u>IMAGE</u>
           Takes a path to a disk image file or block device node. If specified, <b>journalctl</b> will operate on the
           file system in the indicated disk image. This option is similar to <b>--root=</b>, but operates on file
           systems stored in disk images or block devices, thus providing an easy way to extract log data from
           disk images. The disk image should either contain just a file system or a set of file systems within
           a GPT partition table, following the <b>Discoverable</b> <b>Partitions</b> <b>Specification</b>[1]. For further
           information on supported disk images, see <b><a href="../man1/systemd-nspawn.1.html">systemd-nspawn</a></b>(1)'s switch of the same name.

           Added in version 247.

       <b>--image-policy=</b><u>policy</u>
           Takes an image policy string as argument, as per <b><a href="../man7/systemd.image-policy.7.html">systemd.image-policy</a></b>(7). The policy is enforced when
           operating on the disk image specified via <b>--image=</b>, see above. If not specified defaults to the "*"
           policy, i.e. all recognized file systems in the image are used.

       <b>--namespace=</b><u>NAMESPACE</u>
           Takes a journal namespace identifier string as argument. If not specified the data collected by the
           default namespace is shown. If specified shows the log data of the specified namespace instead. If
           the namespace is specified as "*" data from all namespaces is shown, interleaved. If the namespace
           identifier is prefixed with "+" data from the specified namespace and the default namespace is shown,
           interleaved, but no other. For details about journal namespaces see <b><a href="../man8/systemd-journald.service.8.html">systemd-journald.service</a></b>(8).

           Added in version 245.

</pre><h4><b>FILTERING</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options control how to filter journal records:

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--since=</b>, <b>-U</b>, <b>--until=</b>
           Start showing entries on or newer than the specified date, or on or older than the specified date,
           respectively. Date specifications should be of the format "2012-10-30 18:17:16". If the time part is
           omitted, "00:00:00" is assumed. If only the seconds component is omitted, ":00" is assumed. If the
           date component is omitted, the current day is assumed. Alternatively the strings "yesterday",
           "today", "tomorrow" are understood, which refer to 00:00:00 of the day before the current day, the
           current day, or the day after the current day, respectively.  "now" refers to the current time.
           Finally, relative times may be specified, prefixed with "-" or "+", referring to times before or
           after the current time, respectively. For complete time and date specification, see <b><a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time</a></b>(7).
           Note that <b>--output=short-full</b> prints timestamps that follow precisely this format.

           Added in version 195.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--cursor=</b>
           Start showing entries from the location in the journal specified by the passed cursor.

           Added in version 193.

       <b>--after-cursor=</b>
           Start showing entries from the location in the journal <u>after</u> the location specified by the passed
           cursor. The cursor is shown when the <b>--show-cursor</b> option is used.

           Added in version 206.

       <b>--cursor-file=</b><u>FILE</u>
           If <u>FILE</u> exists and contains a cursor, start showing entries <u>after</u> this location. Otherwise show
           entries according to the other given options. At the end, write the cursor of the last entry to <u>FILE</u>.
           Use this option to continually read the journal by sequentially calling <b>journalctl</b>.

           Added in version 242.

       <b>-b</b> <b>[[</b><u>ID</u>][<u>±offset</u>]|<b>all</b>], <b>--boot[=[</b><u>ID</u>][<u>±offset</u>]|<b>all</b>]
           Show messages from a specific boot. This will add a match for "_BOOT_ID=".

           The argument may be empty, in which case logs for the current boot will be shown.

           If the boot ID is omitted, a positive <u>offset</u> will look up the boots starting from the beginning of
           the journal, and an equal-or-less-than zero <u>offset</u> will look up boots starting from the end of the
           journal. Thus, <b>1</b> means the first boot found in the journal in chronological order, <b>2</b> the second and
           so on; while <b>-0</b> is the last boot, <b>-1</b> the boot before last, and so on. An empty <u>offset</u> is equivalent
           to specifying <b>-0</b>, except when the current boot is not the last boot (e.g. because <b>--directory=</b> was
           specified to look at logs from a different machine).

           If the 32-character <u>ID</u> is specified, it may optionally be followed by <u>offset</u> which identifies the
           boot relative to the one given by boot <u>ID</u>. Negative values mean earlier boots and positive values
           mean later boots. If <u>offset</u> is not specified, a value of zero is assumed, and the logs for the boot
           given by <u>ID</u> are shown.

           The special argument <b>all</b> can be used to negate the effect of an earlier use of <b>-b</b>.

           Added in version 186.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--unit=</b><u>UNIT</u><b>|</b><u>PATTERN</u>
           Show messages for the specified systemd unit <u>UNIT</u> (such as a service unit), or for any of the units
           matched by <u>PATTERN</u>. If a pattern is specified, a list of unit names found in the journal is compared
           with the specified pattern and all that match are used. For each unit name, a match is added for
           messages from the unit ("_SYSTEMD_UNIT=<u>UNIT</u>"), along with additional matches for messages from
           systemd and messages about coredumps for the specified unit. A match is also added for
           "_SYSTEMD_SLICE=<u>UNIT</u>", such that if the provided <u>UNIT</u> is a <b><a href="../man5/systemd.slice.5.html">systemd.slice</a></b>(5) unit, all logs of
           children of the slice will be shown.

           With <b>--user</b>, all <b>--unit=</b> arguments will be converted to match user messages as if specified with
           <b>--user-unit=</b>.

           This parameter can be specified multiple times.

           Added in version 195.

       <b>--user-unit=</b>
           Show messages for the specified user session unit. This will add a match for messages from the unit
           ("_SYSTEMD_USER_UNIT=" and "_UID=") and additional matches for messages from session systemd and
           messages about coredumps for the specified unit. A match is also added for
           "_SYSTEMD_USER_SLICE=<u>UNIT</u>", such that if the provided <u>UNIT</u> is a <b><a href="../man5/systemd.slice.5.html">systemd.slice</a></b>(5) unit, all logs of
           children of the unit will be shown.

           This parameter can be specified multiple times.

           Added in version 198.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--invocation=</b><u>ID</u><b>[</b><u>±offset</u>]<b>|</b><u>offset</u>
           Show messages from a specific invocation of unit. This will add a match for
           "_SYSTEMD_INVOCATION_ID=", "OBJECT_SYSTEMD_INVOCATION_ID=", "INVOCATION_ID=", "USER_INVOCATION_ID=".

           A positive <u>offset</u> will look up the invocations of a systemd unit from the beginning of the journal,
           and zero or a negative offset will look up invocations starting from the end of the journal. Thus, <b>1</b>
           means the first invocation found in the journal in chronological order, <b>2</b> the second and so on; while
           <b>0</b> is the latest invocation, <b>-1</b> the invocation before the latest, and so on.

           If the 32-character <u>ID</u> is specified, it may optionally be followed by <u>±offset</u> which identifies the
           invocation relative to the one given by invocation <u>ID</u>. Negative values mean earlier invocations and
           positive values mean later invocations. If <u>±offset</u> is not specified, a value of zero is assumed, and
           the logs for the invocation given by <u>ID</u> will be shown.

           <b>-I</b> is equivalent to <b>--invocation=0</b>, and logs for the latest invocation will be shown.

           When an offset is specified, a unit name must be specified with <b>-u/--unit=</b> or <b>--user-unit=</b> option.

           When specified with <b>-b/--boot=</b>, then invocations are searched within the specified boot.

           Added in version 257.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--identifier=</b><u>SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER</u>
           Show messages for the specified syslog identifier <u>SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER</u>.

           This parameter can be specified multiple times.

           Added in version 217.

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--exclude-identifier=</b><u>SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER</u>
           Exclude messages for the specified syslog identifier <u>SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER</u>.

           This parameter can be specified multiple times.

           Added in version 256.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--priority=</b>
           Filter output by message priorities or priority ranges. Takes either a single numeric or textual log
           level (i.e. between 0/"emerg" and 7/"debug"), or a range of numeric/text log levels in the form
           FROM..TO. The log levels are the usual syslog log levels as documented in <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3), i.e.
           "emerg" (0), "alert" (1), "crit" (2), "err" (3), "warning" (4), "notice" (5), "info" (6),
           "debug" (7). If a single log level is specified, all messages with this log level or a lower (hence
           more important) log level are shown. If a range is specified, all messages within the range are
           shown, including both the start and the end value of the range. This will add "PRIORITY=" matches for
           the specified priorities.

           Added in version 188.

       <b>--facility=</b>
           Filter output by syslog facility. Takes a comma-separated list of numbers or facility names. The
           names are the usual syslog facilities as documented in <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3).  <b>--facility=help</b> may be used to
           display a list of known facility names and exit.

           Added in version 245.

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--grep=</b>
           Filter output to entries where the <u>MESSAGE=</u> field matches the specified regular expression.
           PERL-compatible regular expressions are used, see <b><a href="../man3/pcre2pattern.3.html">pcre2pattern</a></b>(3) for a detailed description of the
           syntax.

           If the pattern is all lowercase, matching is case insensitive. Otherwise, matching is case sensitive.
           This can be overridden with the <b>--case-sensitive</b> option, see below.

           When used with <b>--lines=</b> (not prefixed with "+"), <b>--reverse</b> is implied.

           Added in version 237.

       <b>--case-sensitive[=BOOLEAN]</b>
           Make pattern matching case sensitive or case insensitive.

           Added in version 237.

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--dmesg</b>
           Show only kernel messages. This implies <b>-b</b> and adds the match "_TRANSPORT=kernel".

           Added in version 205.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options control how journal records are printed:

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--output=</b>
           Controls the formatting of the journal entries that are shown. Takes one of the following options:

           <b>short</b>
               is the default and generates an output that is mostly identical to the formatting of classic
               syslog files, showing one line per journal entry.

               Added in version 206.

           <b>short-full</b>
               is very similar, but shows timestamps in the format the <b>--since=</b> and <b>--until=</b> options accept.
               Unlike the timestamp information shown in <b>short</b> output mode this mode includes weekday, year and
               timezone information in the output, and is locale-independent.

               Added in version 232.

           <b>short-iso</b>
               is very similar, but shows timestamps in the <b>RFC</b> <b>3339</b>[2] profile of ISO 8601.

               Added in version 206.

           <b>short-iso-precise</b>
               as for <b>short-iso</b> but includes full microsecond precision.

               Added in version 234.

           <b>short-precise</b>
               is very similar, but shows classic syslog timestamps with full microsecond precision.

               Added in version 207.

           <b>short-monotonic</b>
               is very similar, but shows monotonic timestamps instead of wallclock timestamps.

               Added in version 206.

           <b>short-delta</b>
               as for <b>short-monotonic</b> but includes the time difference to the previous entry. Maybe unreliable
               time differences are marked by a "*".

               Added in version 252.

           <b>short-unix</b>
               is very similar, but shows seconds passed since January 1st 1970 UTC instead of wallclock
               timestamps ("UNIX time"). The time is shown with microsecond accuracy.

               Added in version 230.

           <b>verbose</b>
               shows the full-structured entry items with all fields.

               Added in version 206.

           <b>export</b>
               serializes the journal into a binary (but mostly text-based) stream suitable for backups and
               network transfer (see <b>Journal</b> <b>Export</b> <b>Format</b>[3] for more information). To import the binary stream
               back into native journald format use <b><a href="../man8/systemd-journal-remote.8.html">systemd-journal-remote</a></b>(8).

               Added in version 206.

           <b>json</b>
               formats entries as JSON objects, separated by newline characters (see <b>Journal</b> <b>JSON</b> <b>Format</b>[4] for
               more information). Field values are generally encoded as JSON strings, with three exceptions:

                1. Fields larger than 4096 bytes are encoded as <b>null</b> values. (This may be turned off by passing
                   <b>--all</b>, but be aware that this may allocate overly long JSON objects.)

                2. Journal entries permit non-unique fields within the same log entry. JSON does not allow
                   non-unique fields within objects. Due to this, if a non-unique field is encountered a JSON
                   array is used as field value, listing all field values as elements.

                3. Fields containing non-printable or non-UTF8 bytes are encoded as arrays containing the raw
                   bytes individually formatted as unsigned numbers.

               Note that this encoding is reversible (with the exception of the size limit).

               Added in version 206.

           <b>json-pretty</b>
               formats entries as JSON data structures, but formats them in multiple lines in order to make them
               more readable by humans.

               Added in version 206.

           <b>json-sse</b>
               formats entries as JSON data structures, but wraps them in a format suitable for <b>Server-Sent</b>
               <b>Events</b>[5].

               Added in version 206.

           <b>json-seq</b>
               formats entries as JSON data structures, but prefixes them with an ASCII Record Separator
               character (0x1E) and suffixes them with an ASCII Line Feed character (0x0A), in accordance with
               <b>JavaScript</b> <b>Object</b> <b>Notation</b> <b>(JSON)</b> <b>Text</b> <b>Sequences</b>[6] ("application/json-seq").

               Added in version 240.

           <b>cat</b>
               generates a very terse output, only showing the actual message of each journal entry with no
               metadata, not even a timestamp. If combined with the <b>--output-fields=</b> option will output the
               listed fields for each log record, instead of the message.

               Added in version 206.

           <b>with-unit</b>
               similar to <b>short-full</b>, but prefixes the unit and user unit names instead of the traditional
               syslog identifier. Useful when using templated instances, as it will include the arguments in the
               unit names.

               Added in version 239.

       <b>--truncate-newline</b>
           Truncate each log message at the first newline character on output, so that only the first line of
           each message is displayed.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>--output-fields=</b>
           A comma separated list of the fields which should be included in the output. This has an effect only
           for the output modes which would normally show all fields (<b>verbose</b>, <b>export</b>, <b>json</b>, <b>json-pretty</b>,
           <b>json-sse</b> and <b>json-seq</b>), as well as on <b>cat</b>. For the former, the "__CURSOR", "__REALTIME_TIMESTAMP",
           "__MONOTONIC_TIMESTAMP", and "_BOOT_ID" fields are always printed.

           Added in version 236.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--lines=</b>
           Show the most recent journal events and limit the number of events shown. The argument is a positive
           integer or "all" to disable the limit. Additionally, if the number is prefixed with "+", the oldest
           journal events are used instead. The default value is 10 if no argument is given.

           If <b>--follow</b> is used, this option is implied. When not prefixed with "+" and used with <b>--grep=</b>,
           <b>--reverse</b> is implied.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--reverse</b>
           Reverse output so that the newest entries are displayed first.

           Added in version 198.

       <b>--show-cursor</b>
           The cursor is shown after the last entry after two dashes:

               -- cursor: s=0639...

           The format of the cursor is private and subject to change.

           Added in version 209.

       <b>--utc</b>
           Express time in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

           Added in version 217.

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--catalog</b>
           Augment log lines with explanation texts from the message catalog. This will add explanatory help
           texts to log messages in the output where this is available. These short help texts will explain the
           context of an error or log event, possible solutions, as well as pointers to support forums,
           developer documentation, and any other relevant manuals. Note that help texts are not available for
           all messages, but only for selected ones. For more information on the message catalog, see <b>Journal</b>
           <b>Message</b> <b>Catalogs</b>[7].

           Note: when attaching <b>journalctl</b> output to bug reports, please do <u>not</u> use <b>-x</b>.

           Added in version 196.

       <b>--no-hostname</b>
           Don't show the hostname field of log messages originating from the local host. This switch has an
           effect only on the <b>short</b> family of output modes (see above).

           Note: this option does not remove occurrences of the hostname from log entries themselves, so it does
           not prevent the hostname from being visible in the logs.

           Added in version 230.

       <b>--no-full</b>, <b>--full</b>, <b>-l</b>
           Ellipsize fields when they do not fit in available columns. The default is to show full fields,
           allowing them to wrap or be truncated by the pager, if one is used.

           The old options <b>-l</b>/<b>--full</b> are not useful anymore, except to undo <b>--no-full</b>.

           Added in version 196.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--all</b>
           Show all fields in full, even if they include unprintable characters or are very long. By default,
           fields with unprintable characters are abbreviated as "blob data". (Note that the pager may escape
           unprintable characters again.)

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--follow</b>
           Show only the most recent journal entries, and continuously print new entries as they are appended to
           the journal.

       <b>--no-tail</b>
           Show all stored output lines, even in follow mode. Undoes the effect of <b>--lines=</b>.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
           Suppresses all informational messages (i.e. "-- Journal begins at ...", "-- Reboot --"), any warning
           messages regarding inaccessible system journals when run as a normal user.

</pre><h4><b>PAGER</b> <b>CONTROL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options control page support:

       <b>--no-pager</b>
           Do not pipe output into a pager.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--pager-end</b>
           Immediately jump to the end of the journal inside the implied pager tool. This implies <b>-n1000</b> to
           guarantee that the pager will not buffer logs of unbounded size. This may be overridden with an
           explicit <b>-n</b> with some other numeric value, while <b>-nall</b> will disable this cap. Note that this option
           is only supported for the <b><a href="../man1/less.1.html">less</a></b>(1) pager.

           Added in version 198.

</pre><h4><b>FORWARD</b> <b>SECURE</b> <b>SEALING</b> <b>(FSS)</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options may be used together with the <b>--setup-keys</b> command described below:

       <b>--interval=</b>
           Specifies the change interval for the sealing key when generating an FSS key pair with <b>--setup-keys</b>.
           Shorter intervals increase CPU consumption but shorten the time range of undetectable journal
           alterations. Defaults to 15min.

           Added in version 189.

       <b>--verify-key=</b>
           Specifies the FSS verification key to use for the <b>--verify</b> operation.

           Added in version 189.

       <b>--force</b>
           When <b>--setup-keys</b> is passed and Forward Secure Sealing (FSS) has already been configured, recreate
           FSS keys.

           Added in version 206.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following commands are understood. If none is specified the default is to display journal records:

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--fields</b>
           Print all field names currently used in all entries of the journal.

           Added in version 229.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--field=</b>
           Print all possible data values the specified field can take in all entries of the journal.

           Added in version 195.

       <b>--list-boots</b>
           Show a tabular list of boot numbers (relative to the current boot), their IDs, and the timestamps of
           the first and last message pertaining to the boot. When specified with <b>-n/--lines=[+]</b><u>N</u> option, only
           the first (when the number prefixed with "+") or the last (without prefix) <u>N</u> entries will be shown.
           When specified with <b>-r/--reverse</b>, the list will be shown in the reverse order.

           Added in version 209.

       <b>--list-invocations</b>
           List invocation IDs of a unit. Requires a unit name with <b>-u/--unit=</b> or <b>--user-unit=</b>. Show a tabular
           list of invocation numbers (relative to the current or latest invocation), their IDs, and the
           timestamps of the first and last message pertaining to the invocation. When <b>-b/-boot</b> is specified,
           invocations in the boot will be shown. When specified with <b>-n/--lines=[+]</b><u>N</u> option, only the first
           (when the number prefixed with "+") or the last (without prefix) <u>N</u> entries will be shown. When
           specified with <b>-r/--reverse</b>, the list will be shown in the reverse order.

           Added in version 257.

       <b>--disk-usage</b>
           Shows the current disk usage of all journal files. This shows the sum of the disk usage of all
           archived and active journal files.

           Added in version 190.

       <b>--vacuum-size=</b>, <b>--vacuum-time=</b>, <b>--vacuum-files=</b>
           <b>--vacuum-size=</b> removes the oldest archived journal files until the disk space they use falls below
           the specified size. Accepts the usual "K", "M", "G" and "T" suffixes (to the base of 1024).

           <b>--vacuum-time=</b> removes archived journal files older than the specified timespan. Accepts the usual
           "s" (default), "m", "h", "days", "weeks", "months", and "years" suffixes, see <b><a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time</a></b>(7) for
           details.

           <b>--vacuum-files=</b> leaves only the specified number of separate journal files.

           Note that running <b>--vacuum-size=</b> has only an indirect effect on the output shown by <b>--disk-usage</b>, as
           the latter includes active journal files, while the vacuuming operation only operates on archived
           journal files. Similarly, <b>--vacuum-files=</b> might not actually reduce the number of journal files to
           below the specified number, as it will not remove active journal files.

           <b>--vacuum-size=</b>, <b>--vacuum-time=</b> and <b>--vacuum-files=</b> may be combined in a single invocation to enforce
           any combination of a size, a time and a number of files limit on the archived journal files.
           Specifying any of these three parameters as zero is equivalent to not enforcing the specific limit,
           and is thus redundant.

           These three switches may also be combined with <b>--rotate</b> into one command. If so, all active files are
           rotated first, and the requested vacuuming operation is executed right after. The rotation has the
           effect that all currently active files are archived (and potentially new, empty journal files opened
           as replacement), and hence the vacuuming operation has the greatest effect as it can take all log
           data written so far into account.

           Added in version 218.

       <b>--verify</b>
           Check the journal file for internal consistency. If the file has been generated with FSS enabled and
           the FSS verification key has been specified with <b>--verify-key=</b>, authenticity of the journal file is
           verified.

           Added in version 189.

       <b>--sync</b>
           Asks the journal daemon to write all yet unwritten journal data to the backing file system and
           synchronize all journals. This call does not return until the synchronization operation is complete.
           This command guarantees that any log messages written before its invocation are safely stored on disk
           at the time it returns.

           Added in version 228.

       <b>--relinquish-var</b>
           Asks the journal daemon for the reverse operation to <b>--flush</b>: if requested the daemon will write
           further log data to <a href="file:/run/log/journal/">/run/log/journal/</a> and stops writing to <a href="file:/var/log/journal/.">/var/log/journal/.</a> A subsequent call to
           <b>--flush</b> causes the log output to switch back to <a href="file:/var/log/journal/">/var/log/journal/</a>, see above.

           Added in version 243.

       <b>--smart-relinquish-var</b>
           Similar to <b>--relinquish-var</b>, but executes no operation if the root file system and <a href="file:/var/log/journal/">/var/log/journal/</a>
           reside on the same mount point. This operation is used during system shutdown in order to make the
           journal daemon stop writing data to <a href="file:/var/log/journal/">/var/log/journal/</a> in case that directory is located on a mount
           point that needs to be unmounted.

           Added in version 243.

       <b>--flush</b>
           Asks the journal daemon to flush any log data stored in <a href="file:/run/log/journal/">/run/log/journal/</a> into <a href="file:/var/log/journal/">/var/log/journal/</a>, if
           persistent storage is enabled. This call does not return until the operation is complete. Note that
           this call is idempotent: the data is only flushed from <a href="file:/run/log/journal/">/run/log/journal/</a> into <a href="file:/var/log/journal/">/var/log/journal/</a> once
           during system runtime (but see <b>--relinquish-var</b> below), and this command exits cleanly without
           executing any operation if this has already happened. This command effectively guarantees that all
           data is flushed to <a href="file:/var/log/journal/">/var/log/journal/</a> at the time it returns.

           Added in version 217.

       <b>--rotate</b>
           Asks the journal daemon to rotate journal files. This call does not return until the rotation
           operation is complete. Journal file rotation has the effect that all currently active journal files
           are marked as archived and renamed, so that they are never written to in future. New (empty) journal
           files are then created in their place. This operation may be combined with <b>--vacuum-size=</b>,
           <b>--vacuum-time=</b> and <b>--vacuum-file=</b> into a single command, see above.

           Added in version 227.

       <b>--header</b>
           Instead of showing journal contents, show internal header information of the journal fields accessed.

           This option is particularly useful when trying to identify out-of-order journal entries, as happens
           for example when the machine is booted with the wrong system time.

           Added in version 187.

       <b>--list-catalog</b> <b>[</b><u>128-bit-ID...</u>]
           List the contents of the message catalog as a table of message IDs, plus their short description
           strings.

           If any <u>128-bit-ID</u>s are specified, only those entries are shown.

           Added in version 196.

       <b>--dump-catalog</b> <b>[</b><u>128-bit-ID...</u>]
           Show the contents of the message catalog, with entries separated by a line consisting of two dashes
           and the ID (the format is the same as .catalog files).

           If any <u>128-bit-ID</u>s are specified, only those entries are shown.

           Added in version 199.

       <b>--update-catalog</b>
           Update the message catalog index. This command needs to be executed each time new catalog files are
           installed, removed, or updated to rebuild the binary catalog index.

           Added in version 196.

       <b>--setup-keys</b>
           Instead of showing journal contents, generate a new key pair for Forward Secure Sealing (FSS). This
           will generate a sealing key and a verification key. The sealing key is stored in the journal data
           directory and shall remain on the host. The verification key should be stored externally. Refer to
           the <b>Seal=</b> option in <b><a href="../man5/journald.conf.5.html">journald.conf</a></b>(5) for information on Forward Secure Sealing and for a link to a
           refereed scholarly paper detailing the cryptographic theory it is based on.

           Added in version 189.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       On success, 0 is returned; otherwise, a non-zero failure code is returned.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL</u>
           The maximum log level of emitted messages (messages with a higher log level, i.e. less important
           ones, will be suppressed). Takes a comma-separated list of values. A value may be either one of (in
           order of decreasing importance) <b>emerg</b>, <b>alert</b>, <b>crit</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warning</b>, <b>notice</b>, <b>info</b>, <b>debug</b>, or an integer
           in the range 0...7. See <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3) for more information. Each value may optionally be prefixed with
           one of <b>console</b>, <b>syslog</b>, <b>kmsg</b> or <b>journal</b> followed by a colon to set the maximum log level for that
           specific log target (e.g.  <b>SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL=debug,console:info</b> specifies to log at debug level
           except when logging to the console which should be at info level). Note that the global maximum log
           level takes priority over any per target maximum log levels.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_COLOR</u>
           A boolean. If true, messages written to the tty will be colored according to priority.

           This setting is only useful when messages are written directly to the terminal, because <b><a href="../man1/journalctl.1.html">journalctl</a></b>(1)
           and other tools that display logs will color messages based on the log level on their own.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TIME</u>
           A boolean. If true, console log messages will be prefixed with a timestamp.

           This setting is only useful when messages are written directly to the terminal or a file, because
           <b><a href="../man1/journalctl.1.html">journalctl</a></b>(1) and other tools that display logs will attach timestamps based on the entry metadata on
           their own.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LOCATION</u>
           A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with a filename and line number in the source code
           where the message originates.

           Note that the log location is often attached as metadata to journal entries anyway. Including it
           directly in the message text can nevertheless be convenient when debugging programs.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TID</u>
           A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with the current numerical thread ID (TID).

           Note that the this information is attached as metadata to journal entries anyway. Including it
           directly in the message text can nevertheless be convenient when debugging programs.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TARGET</u>
           The destination for log messages. One of <b>console</b> (log to the attached tty), <b>console-prefixed</b> (log to
           the attached tty but with prefixes encoding the log level and "facility", see <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3), <b>kmsg</b> (log to
           the kernel circular log buffer), <b>journal</b> (log to the journal), <b>journal-or-kmsg</b> (log to the journal if
           available, and to kmsg otherwise), <b>auto</b> (determine the appropriate log target automatically, the
           default), <b>null</b> (disable log output).

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_RATELIMIT_KMSG</u>
           Whether to ratelimit kmsg or not. Takes a boolean. Defaults to "true". If disabled, systemd will not
           ratelimit messages written to kmsg.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</u>
           Pager to use when <b>--no-pager</b> is not given; overrides <u>$PAGER</u>. If neither <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</u> nor <u>$PAGER</u> are
           set, a set of well-known pager implementations are tried in turn, including <b><a href="../man1/less.1.html">less</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/more.1.html">more</a></b>(1),
           until one is found. If no pager implementation is discovered no pager is invoked. Setting this
           environment variable to an empty string or the value "cat" is equivalent to passing <b>--no-pager</b>.

           Note: if <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</u> is not set, <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</u> (as well as <u>$PAGER</u>) will be silently
           ignored.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LESS</u>
           Override the options passed to <b>less</b> (by default "FRSXMK").

           Users might want to change two options in particular:

           <b>K</b>
               This option instructs the pager to exit immediately when Ctrl+C is pressed. To allow <b>less</b> to
               handle Ctrl+C itself to switch back to the pager command prompt, unset this option.

               If the value of <u>$SYSTEMD_LESS</u> does not include "K", and the pager that is invoked is <b>less</b>, Ctrl+C
               will be ignored by the executable, and needs to be handled by the pager.

           <b>X</b>
               This option instructs the pager to not send termcap initialization and deinitialization strings
               to the terminal. It is set by default to allow command output to remain visible in the terminal
               even after the pager exits. Nevertheless, this prevents some pager functionality from working, in
               particular paged output cannot be scrolled with the mouse.

           Note that setting the regular <u>$LESS</u> environment variable has no effect for <b>less</b> invocations by
           systemd tools.

           See <b><a href="../man1/less.1.html">less</a></b>(1) for more discussion.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LESSCHARSET</u>
           Override the charset passed to <b>less</b> (by default "utf-8", if the invoking terminal is determined to be
           UTF-8 compatible).

           Note that setting the regular <u>$LESSCHARSET</u> environment variable has no effect for <b>less</b> invocations by
           systemd tools.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</u>
           Takes a boolean argument. When true, the "secure" mode of the pager is enabled; if false, disabled.
           If <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</u> is not set at all, secure mode is enabled if the effective UID is not the
           same as the owner of the login session, see <b><a href="../man2/geteuid.2.html">geteuid</a></b>(2) and <b><a href="../man3/sd_pid_get_owner_uid.3.html">sd_pid_get_owner_uid</a></b>(3). In secure mode,
           <b>LESSSECURE=1</b> will be set when invoking the pager, and the pager shall disable commands that open or
           create new files or start new subprocesses. When <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</u> is not set at all, pagers which
           are not known to implement secure mode will not be used. (Currently only <b><a href="../man1/less.1.html">less</a></b>(1) implements secure
           mode.)

           Note: when commands are invoked with elevated privileges, for example under <b><a href="../man8/sudo.8.html">sudo</a></b>(8) or <b><a href="../man1/pkexec.1.html">pkexec</a></b>(1),
           care must be taken to ensure that unintended interactive features are not enabled. "Secure" mode for
           the pager may be enabled automatically as describe above. Setting <u>SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE=0</u> or not
           removing it from the inherited environment allows the user to invoke arbitrary commands. Note that if
           the <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</u> or <u>$PAGER</u> variables are to be honoured, <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</u> must be set too. It
           might be reasonable to completely disable the pager using <b>--no-pager</b> instead.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_COLORS</u>
           Takes a boolean argument. When true, <b>systemd</b> and related utilities will use colors in their output,
           otherwise the output will be monochrome. Additionally, the variable can take one of the following
           special values: "16", "256" to restrict the use of colors to the base 16 or 256 ANSI colors,
           respectively. This can be specified to override the automatic decision based on <u>$TERM</u> and what the
           console is connected to.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_URLIFY</u>
           The value must be a boolean. Controls whether clickable links should be generated in the output for
           terminal emulators supporting this. This can be specified to override the decision that <b>systemd</b> makes
           based on <u>$TERM</u> and other conditions.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Without arguments, all collected logs are shown unfiltered:

           journalctl

       With one match specified, all entries with a field matching the expression are shown:

           journalctl _SYSTEMD_UNIT=avahi-daemon.service
           journalctl _SYSTEMD_CGROUP=/user.slice/user-42.slice/session-c1.scope

       If two different fields are matched, only entries matching both expressions at the same time are shown:

           journalctl _SYSTEMD_UNIT=avahi-daemon.service _PID=28097

       If two matches refer to the same field, all entries matching either expression are shown:

           journalctl _SYSTEMD_UNIT=avahi-daemon.service _SYSTEMD_UNIT=dbus.service

       If the separator "+" is used, two expressions may be combined in a logical OR. The following will show
       all messages from the Avahi service process with the PID 28097 plus all messages from the D-Bus service
       (from any of its processes):

           journalctl _SYSTEMD_UNIT=avahi-daemon.service _PID=28097 + _SYSTEMD_UNIT=dbus.service

       To show all fields emitted <u>by</u> a unit and <u>about</u> the unit, option <b>-u</b>/<b>--unit=</b> should be used.  <b>journalctl</b> <b>-u</b>
       <u>name</u> expands to a complex filter similar to

           _SYSTEMD_UNIT=<u>name</u>.service
             + UNIT=<u>name</u>.service _PID=1
             + OBJECT_SYSTEMD_UNIT=<u>name</u>.service _UID=0
             + COREDUMP_UNIT=<u>name</u>.service _UID=0 MESSAGE_ID=fc2e22bc6ee647b6b90729ab34a250b1

       (see <b><a href="../man7/systemd.journal-fields.7.html">systemd.journal-fields</a></b>(7) for an explanation of those patterns).

       Show all logs generated by the D-Bus executable:

           journalctl <a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?dbus-daemon">/usr/bin/dbus-daemon</a>

       Show all kernel logs from previous boot:

           journalctl -k -b -1

       Show a live log display from a system service apache.service:

           journalctl -f -u apache
