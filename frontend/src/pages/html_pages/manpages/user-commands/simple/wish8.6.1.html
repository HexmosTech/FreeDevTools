</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       wish - Simple windowing shell

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wish</b> ?<b>-encoding</b> <u>name</u>? ?<u>fileName</u> <u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-encoding</b> <u>name</u>      Specifies  the  encoding  of  the  text  stored  in  <u>fileName</u>.   This  option is only
                           recognized prior to the <u>fileName</u> argument.

       <b>-colormap</b> <u>new</u>       Specifies that the window should have a new private colormap  instead  of  using  the
                           default colormap for the screen.

       <b>-display</b> <u>display</u>    Display (and screen) on which to display window.

       <b>-geometry</b> <u>geometry</u>  Initial geometry to use for window.  If this option is specified, its value is stored
                           in the <b>geometry</b> global variable of the application's Tcl interpreter.

       <b>-name</b> <u>name</u>          Use  <u>name</u>  as  the  title  to  be  displayed  in  the  window, and as the name of the
                           interpreter for <b>send</b> commands.

       <b>-sync</b>               Execute all X server commands synchronously, so that errors are reported immediately.
                           This will result in much slower execution, but it is useful for debugging.

       <b>-use</b> <u>id</u>             Specifies that the main window for the application is to be embedded  in  the  window
                           whose  identifier  is <u>id</u>, instead of being created as an independent toplevel window.
                           <u>Id</u> must be specified in the same way as the value for the <b>-use</b>  option  for  toplevel
                           widgets (i.e.  it has a form like that returned by the <b>winfo</b> <b>id</b> command).
                           Note  that on some platforms this will only work correctly if <u>id</u> refers to a Tk <b>frame</b>
                           or <b>toplevel</b> that has its <b>-container</b> option enabled.

       <b>-visual</b> <u>visual</u>      Specifies the visual to use for the  window.   <u>Visual</u>  may  have  any  of  the  forms
                           supported by the <b>Tk_GetVisual</b> procedure.

       <b>--</b>                  Pass   all  remaining  arguments  through  to  the  script's  <b>argv</b>  variable  without
                           interpreting them.  This provides a mechanism for passing arguments such as <b>-name</b>  to
                           a script instead of having <b>wish</b> interpret them.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Wish</b>  is a simple program consisting of the Tcl command language, the Tk toolkit, and a main program that
       reads commands from standard input or from a file.  It creates a  main  window  and  then  processes  Tcl
       commands.   If <b>wish</b> is invoked with arguments, then the first few arguments, ?<b>-encoding</b> <u>name</u>? ?<u>fileName</u>?,
       specify the name of a script file, and, optionally, the encoding of the text data stored in  that  script
       file.  A value for <u>fileName</u> is recognized if the appropriate argument does not start with “-”.

       If  there  are  no  arguments,  or  the arguments do not specify a <u>fileName</u>, then wish reads Tcl commands
       interactively from standard input.  It will continue processing commands  until  all  windows  have  been
       deleted  or until end-of-file is reached on standard input.  If there exists a file “<b>.wishrc</b>” in the home
       directory of the user, <b>wish</b> evaluates the file as a Tcl script just before reading the first command from
       standard input.

       If arguments to <b>wish</b> do specify a <u>fileName</u>, then <u>fileName</u> is treated as the name of a script file.   <b>Wish</b>
       will evaluate the script in <u>fileName</u> (which presumably creates a user interface), then it will respond to
       events  until all windows have been deleted.  Commands will not be read from standard input.  There is no
       automatic evaluation of “<b>.wishrc</b>” when the name of a script file is presented on the <b>wish</b>  command  line,
       but the script file can always <b>source</b> it if desired.

       Note  that  on  Windows,  the  <b>wish</b><u>version</u><b>.exe</b>  program  varies  from  the <b>tclsh</b><u>version</u><b>.exe</b> program in an
       additional important way: it does not connect to a standard Windows console and  is  instead  a  windowed
       program. Because of this, it additionally provides access to its own <b>console</b> command.

</pre><h4><b>OPTION</b> <b>PROCESSING</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Wish</b> automatically processes all of the command-line options described in the <b>OPTIONS</b> summary above.  Any
       other  command-line arguments besides these are passed through to the application using the <b>argc</b> and <b>argv</b>
       variables described later.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>NAME</b> <b>AND</b> <b>CLASS</b></h4><pre>
       The name of the application, which is used for purposes such as <b>send</b> commands, is taken  from  the  <b>-name</b>
       option, if it is specified;  otherwise it is taken from <u>fileName</u>, if it is specified, or from the command
       name  by  which <b>wish</b> was invoked.  In the last two cases, if the name contains a “/” character, then only
       the characters after the last slash are used as the application name.

       The  class  of  the  application,  which  is  used  for  purposes  such  as  specifying  options  with  a
       <b>RESOURCE_MANAGER</b>  property  or  .Xdefaults  file, is the same as its name except that the first letter is
       capitalized.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Wish</b> sets the following Tcl variables:

       <b>argc</b>           Contains a count of the number of <u>arg</u> arguments (0 if none),  not  including  the  options
                      described above.

       <b>argv</b>           Contains a Tcl list whose elements are the <u>arg</u> arguments that follow a <b>--</b> option or do not
                      match any of the options described in <b>OPTIONS</b> above, in order, or an empty string if there
                      are no such arguments.

       <b>argv0</b>          Contains  <u>fileName</u>  if  it  was specified.  Otherwise, contains the name by which <b>wish</b> was
                      invoked.

       <b>geometry</b>       If the <b>-geometry</b> option is specified, <b>wish</b> copies its value into this  variable.   If  the
                      variable  still  exists  after  <u>fileName</u>  has  been  evaluated, <b>wish</b> uses the value of the
                      variable in a <b>wm</b> <b>geometry</b> command to set the main window's geometry.

       <b>tcl_interactive</b>
                      Contains 1 if <b>wish</b> is reading commands  interactively  (<u>fileName</u>  was  not  specified  and
                      standard input is a terminal-like device), 0 otherwise.

</pre><h4><b>SCRIPT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       If you create a Tcl script in a file whose first line is
              <b>#!/usr/local/bin/wish</b>
       then  you can invoke the script file directly from your shell if you mark it as executable.  This assumes
       that <b>wish</b> has been installed in the default location in <a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a>;  if  it  is  installed  somewhere
       else then you will have to modify the above line to match.  Many UNIX systems do not allow the <b>#!</b> line to
       exceed  about  30  characters in length, so be sure that the <b>wish</b> executable can be accessed with a short
       file name.

       An even better approach is to start your script files with the following three lines:
              <b>#!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a></b>
              <b>#</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>line</b> <b>restarts</b> <b>using</b> <b>wish</b> <b>\</b>
              <b>exec</b> <b>wish</b> <b>"$0"</b> <b>${1+"$@"}</b>
       This approach has three advantages over the approach in the previous paragraph.  First, the  location  of
       the  <b>wish</b> binary does not have to be hard-wired into the script:  it can be anywhere in your shell search
       path.  Second, it gets around the 30-character file name limit in the  previous  approach.   Third,  this
       approach will work even if <b>wish</b> is itself a shell script (this is done on some systems in order to handle
       multiple  architectures  or  operating systems:  the <b>wish</b> script selects one of several binaries to run).
       The three lines cause both <b>sh</b> and <b>wish</b> to process the script, but the <b>exec</b> is only executed  by  <b>sh</b>.   <b>sh</b>
       processes  the  script  first;   it treats the second line as a comment and executes the third line.  The
       <b>exec</b> statement cause the shell to stop processing and instead to start up <b>wish</b> to  reprocess  the  entire
       script.   When  <b>wish</b>  starts up, it treats all three lines as comments, since the backslash at the end of
       the second line causes the third line to be treated as part of the comment on the second line.

       The end of a script file may be marked either by the physical end of the medium,  or  by  the  character,
       “\032”  (“\u001a”,  control-Z).  If this character is present in the file, the <b>wish</b> application will read
       text up to but not including the character.  An application that requires this character in the file  may
       encode it as “\032”, “\x1a”, or “\u001a”; or may generate it by use of commands such as <b>format</b> or <b>binary</b>.

</pre><h4><b>PROMPTS</b></h4><pre>
       When  <b>wish</b>  is  invoked interactively it normally prompts for each command with “<b>%</b> ”.  You can change the
       prompt by setting the variables <b>tcl_prompt1</b> and <b>tcl_prompt2</b>.  If variable <b>tcl_prompt1</b> exists then it must
       consist of a Tcl script to output a prompt;  instead of outputting a prompt <b>wish</b> will evaluate the script
       in <b>tcl_prompt1</b>.  The variable <b>tcl_prompt2</b> is used in a similar way  when  a  newline  is  typed  but  the
       current  command  is  not yet complete; if <b>tcl_prompt2</b> is not set then no prompt is output for incomplete
       commands.
