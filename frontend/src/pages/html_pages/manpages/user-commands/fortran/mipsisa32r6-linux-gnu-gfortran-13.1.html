</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gfortran - GNU Fortran compiler

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       gfortran [<b>-c</b>|<b>-S</b>|<b>-E</b>]
                [<b>-g</b>] [<b>-pg</b>] [<b>-O</b><u>level</u>]
                [<b>-W</b><u>warn</u>...] [<b>-pedantic</b>]
                [<b>-I</b><u>dir</u>...] [<b>-L</b><u>dir</u>...]
                [<b>-D</b><u>macro</u>[=<u>defn</u>]...] [<b>-U</b><u>macro</u>]
                [<b>-f</b><u>option</u>...]
                [<b>-m</b><u>machine-option</u>...]
                [<b>-o</b> <u>outfile</u>] <u>infile</u>...

       Only the most useful options are listed here; see below for the remainder.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>gfortran</b> command supports all the options supported by the <b>gcc</b> command.  Only options specific to GNU
       Fortran are documented here.

       All GCC and GNU Fortran options are accepted both by <b>gfortran</b> and by <b>gcc</b> (as well as any other drivers
       built at the same time, such as <b>g++</b>), since adding GNU Fortran to the GCC distribution enables acceptance
       of GNU Fortran options by all of the relevant drivers.

       In some cases, options have positive and negative forms; the negative form of <b>-ffoo</b> would be <b>-fno-foo</b>.
       This manual documents only one of these two forms, whichever one is not the default.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Here is a summary of all the options specific to GNU Fortran, grouped by type.  Explanations are in the
       following sections.

   <b>Options</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>Fortran</b> <b>dialect</b>
       The following options control the details of the Fortran dialect accepted by the compiler:

       <b>-ffree-form</b>
       <b>-ffixed-form</b>
           Specify the layout used by the source file.  The free form  layout  was  introduced  in  Fortran  90.
           Fixed  form  was traditionally used in older Fortran programs.  When neither option is specified, the
           source form is determined by the file extension.

       <b>-fall-intrinsics</b>
           This option causes all intrinsic procedures (including the GNU-specific extensions) to  be  accepted.
           This  can  be  useful  with  <b>-std=</b>  to  force standard-compliance but get access to the full range of
           intrinsics available with <b>gfortran</b>.  As a consequence, <b>-Wintrinsics-std</b> will be ignored and no  user-
           defined  procedure  with  the  same name as any intrinsic will be called except when it is explicitly
           declared "EXTERNAL".

       <b>-fallow-argument-mismatch</b>
           Some code contains calls to external procedures with mismatches between the calls and  the  procedure
           definition, or with mismatches between different calls. Such code is non-conforming, and will usually
           be  flagged  with an error.  This options degrades the error to a warning, which can only be disabled
           by disabling all warnings via <b>-w</b>.  Only a single occurrence per argument is flagged by this  warning.
           <b>-fallow-argument-mismatch</b> is implied by <b>-std=legacy</b>.

           Using  this option is <u>strongly</u> discouraged.  It is possible to provide standard-conforming code which
           allows different types of arguments by using an explicit interface and TYPE(*).

       <b>-fallow-invalid-boz</b>
           A BOZ literal constant can occur in a limited number of  contexts  in  standard  conforming  Fortran.
           This  option  degrades  an  error condition to a warning, and allows a BOZ literal constant to appear
           where the Fortran standard would otherwise prohibit its use.

       <b>-fd-lines-as-code</b>
       <b>-fd-lines-as-comments</b>
           Enable special treatment for lines beginning  with  "d"  or  "D"  in  fixed  form  sources.   If  the
           <b>-fd-lines-as-code</b>  option is given they are treated as if the first column contained a blank.  If the
           <b>-fd-lines-as-comments</b> option is given, they are treated as comment lines.

       <b>-fdec</b>
           DEC compatibility mode. Enables extensions and other features that  mimic  the  default  behavior  of
           older  compilers  (such as DEC).  These features are non-standard and should be avoided at all costs.
           For details on GNU Fortran's implementation of these extensions see the full documentation.

           Other  flags  enabled  by  this  switch  are:   <b>-fdollar-ok</b>   <b>-fcray-pointer</b>   <b>-fdec-char-conversions</b>
           <b>-fdec-structure</b>  <b>-fdec-intrinsic-ints</b>  <b>-fdec-static</b>  <b>-fdec-math</b> <b>-fdec-include</b> <b>-fdec-blank-format-item</b>
           <b>-fdec-format-defaults</b>

           If <b>-fd-lines-as-code</b>/<b>-fd-lines-as-comments</b> are unset, then <b>-fdec</b> also sets <b>-fd-lines-as-comments</b>.

       <b>-fdec-char-conversions</b>
           Enable the use  of  character  literals  in  assignments  and  "DATA"  statements  for  non-character
           variables.

       <b>-fdec-structure</b>
           Enable  DEC  "STRUCTURE"  and "RECORD" as well as "UNION", "MAP", and dot ('.') as a member separator
           (in addition to '%'). This is provided for compatibility only; Fortran 90  derived  types  should  be
           used instead where possible.

       <b>-fdec-intrinsic-ints</b>
           Enable  B/I/J/K kind variants of existing integer functions (e.g. BIAND, IIAND, JIAND, etc...). For a
           complete list of intrinsics see the full documentation.

       <b>-fdec-math</b>
           Enable legacy math intrinsics such as COTAN and degree-valued  trigonometric  functions  (e.g.  TAND,
           ATAND, etc...) for compatability with older code.

       <b>-fdec-static</b>
           Enable  DEC-style  STATIC and AUTOMATIC attributes to explicitly specify the storage of variables and
           other objects.

       <b>-fdec-include</b>
           Enable parsing of INCLUDE as a statement in addition to parsing it as INCLUDE line.  When  parsed  as
           INCLUDE statement, INCLUDE does not have to be on a single line and can use line continuations.

       <b>-fdec-format-defaults</b>
           Enable  format specifiers F, G and I to be used without width specifiers, default widths will be used
           instead.

       <b>-fdec-blank-format-item</b>
           Enable a blank format item at the end of a format specification  i.e.  nothing  following  the  final
           comma.

       <b>-fdollar-ok</b>
           Allow <b>$</b> as a valid non-first character in a symbol name. Symbols that start with <b>$</b> are rejected since
           it is unclear which rules to apply to implicit typing as different vendors implement different rules.
           Using <b>$</b> in "IMPLICIT" statements is also rejected.

       <b>-fbackslash</b>
           Change  the  interpretation  of  backslashes  in string literals from a single backslash character to
           "C-style" escape characters. The following combinations are expanded "\a", "\b",  "\f",  "\n",  "\r",
           "\t",  "\v",  "\\",  and  "\0" to the ASCII characters alert, backspace, form feed, newline, carriage
           return, horizontal tab, vertical  tab,  backslash,  and  NUL,  respectively.   Additionally,  "\x"<u>nn</u>,
           "\u"<u>nnnn</u>  and  "\U"<u>nnnnnnnn</u>  (where  each  <u>n</u>  is a hexadecimal digit) are translated into the Unicode
           characters corresponding to the specified code points. All other combinations of a character preceded
           by \ are unexpanded.

       <b>-fmodule-private</b>
           Set the default accessibility of module entities to "PRIVATE".  Use-associated entities will  not  be
           accessible unless they are explicitly declared as "PUBLIC".

       <b>-ffixed-line-length-</b><u>n</u>
           Set  column  after  which characters are ignored in typical fixed-form lines in the source file, and,
           unless "-fno-pad-source", through which spaces are assumed (as if padded to that  length)  after  the
           ends of short fixed-form lines.

           Popular  values  for  <u>n</u>  include  72  (the  standard  and  the  default),  80  (card  image), and 132
           (corresponding to "extended-source" options in some popular compilers).  <u>n</u> may also be <b>none</b>,  meaning
           that  the entire line is meaningful and that continued character constants never have implicit spaces
           appended  to  them  to  fill  out  the  line.   <b>-ffixed-line-length-0</b>  means  the   same   thing   as
           <b>-ffixed-line-length-none</b>.

       <b>-fno-pad-source</b>
           By default fixed-form lines have spaces assumed (as if padded to that length) after the ends of short
           fixed-form  lines.   This is not done either if <b>-ffixed-line-length-0</b>, <b>-ffixed-line-length-none</b> or if
           <b>-fno-pad-source</b> option is used.  With any of those options continued character constants  never  have
           implicit spaces appended to them to fill out the line.

       <b>-ffree-line-length-</b><u>n</u>
           Set  column  after  which  characters  are ignored in typical free-form lines in the source file. The
           default  value  is  132.   <u>n</u>  may  be  <b>none</b>,  meaning   that   the   entire   line   is   meaningful.
           <b>-ffree-line-length-0</b> means the same thing as <b>-ffree-line-length-none</b>.

       <b>-fmax-identifier-length=</b><u>n</u>
           Specify  the  maximum  allowed  identifier length. Typical values are 31 (Fortran 95) and 63 (Fortran
           2003 and later).

       <b>-fimplicit-none</b>
           Specify that no implicit typing is allowed, unless  overridden  by  explicit  "IMPLICIT"  statements.
           This is the equivalent of adding "implicit none" to the start of every procedure.

       <b>-fcray-pointer</b>
           Enable the Cray pointer extension, which provides C-like pointer functionality.

       <b>-fopenacc</b>
           Enable  the  OpenACC  extensions.  This includes OpenACC "!$acc" directives in free form and "c$acc",
           *$acc and "!$acc" directives in fixed form, "!$" conditional compilation sentinels in free  form  and
           "c$",  "*$"  and  "!$"  sentinels  in  fixed  form, and when linking arranges for the OpenACC runtime
           library to be linked in.

       <b>-fopenmp</b>
           Enable the OpenMP extensions.  This includes OpenMP "!$omp" directives  in  free  form  and  "c$omp",
           *$omp  and  "!$omp" directives in fixed form, "!$" conditional compilation sentinels in free form and
           "c$", "*$" and "!$" sentinels in fixed form, and when linking arranges for the OpenMP runtime library
           to be linked in.  The option <b>-fopenmp</b> implies <b>-frecursive</b>.

       <b>-fno-range-check</b>
           Disable range checking on results of simplification of constant expressions during compilation.   For
           example,  GNU  Fortran  will  give an error at compile time when simplifying "a = 1. / 0".  With this
           option, no error will be given and "a" will be assigned the  value  "+Infinity".   If  an  expression
           evaluates to a value outside of the relevant range of ["-HUGE()":HUGE()], then the expression will be
           replaced  by  "-Inf"  or  "+Inf"  as appropriate.  Similarly, "DATA i/Z'FFFFFFFF'/" will result in an
           integer overflow on most systems, but with <b>-fno-range-check</b> the value will "wrap around" and "i" will
           be initialized to -1 instead.

       <b>-fdefault-integer-8</b>
           Set the default integer and logical types to an 8 byte wide type.  This option also affects the  kind
           of  integer  constants  like  42.  Unlike  <b>-finteger-4-integer-8</b>,  it does not promote variables with
           explicit kind declaration.

       <b>-fdefault-real-8</b>
           Set the default real type to an 8 byte wide type.  This option also affects the  kind  of  non-double
           real  constants  like  1.0.   This option promotes the default width of "DOUBLE PRECISION" and double
           real constants like "1.d0" to 16 bytes if possible.  If  "-fdefault-double-8"  is  given  along  with
           "fdefault-real-8",   "DOUBLE   PRECISION"  and  double  real  constants  are  not  promoted.   Unlike
           <b>-freal-4-real-8</b>, "fdefault-real-8" does not promote variables with explicit kind declarations.

       <b>-fdefault-real-10</b>
           Set the default real type to an 10 byte wide type.  This option also affects the kind  of  non-double
           real  constants  like  1.0.   This option promotes the default width of "DOUBLE PRECISION" and double
           real constants like "1.d0" to 16 bytes if possible.  If  "-fdefault-double-8"  is  given  along  with
           "fdefault-real-10",   "DOUBLE  PRECISION"  and  double  real  constants  are  not  promoted.   Unlike
           <b>-freal-4-real-10</b>, "fdefault-real-10" does not promote variables with explicit kind declarations.

       <b>-fdefault-real-16</b>
           Set the default real type to an 16 byte wide type.  This option also affects the kind  of  non-double
           real  constants  like  1.0.   This option promotes the default width of "DOUBLE PRECISION" and double
           real constants like "1.d0" to 16 bytes if possible.  If  "-fdefault-double-8"  is  given  along  with
           "fdefault-real-16",   "DOUBLE  PRECISION"  and  double  real  constants  are  not  promoted.   Unlike
           <b>-freal-4-real-16</b>, "fdefault-real-16" does not promote variables with explicit kind declarations.

       <b>-fdefault-double-8</b>
           Set the "DOUBLE PRECISION" type and double real constants like "1.d0" to an 8  byte  wide  type.   Do
           nothing  if  this  is already the default.  This option prevents <b>-fdefault-real-8</b>, <b>-fdefault-real-10</b>,
           and <b>-fdefault-real-16</b>, from promoting "DOUBLE PRECISION" and double real constants like "1.d0" to  16
           bytes.

       <b>-finteger-4-integer-8</b>
           Promote  all  INTEGER(KIND=4)  entities  to an INTEGER(KIND=8) entities.  If "KIND=8" is unavailable,
           then an error will be issued.  This option should be used with care and may not be suitable for  your
           codes.   Areas  of  possible concern include calls to external procedures, alignment in "EQUIVALENCE"
           and/or "COMMON", generic interfaces, BOZ literal constant conversion, and  I/O.   Inspection  of  the

       <b>-freal-4-real-10</b>
       <b>-freal-4-real-16</b>
       <b>-freal-8-real-4</b>
       <b>-freal-8-real-10</b>
       <b>-freal-8-real-16</b>
           Promote all REAL(KIND=M) entities to REAL(KIND=N) entities.  If REAL(KIND=N) is unavailable, then  an
           error  will  be  issued.  The "-freal-4-" flags also affect the default real kind and the "-freal-8-"
           flags also the double-precision real kind.  All other real-kind types are unaffected by this  option.
           The  promotion  is  also applied to real literal constants of default and double-precision kind and a
           specified kind number of 4 or 8,  respectively.   However,  "-fdefault-real-8",  "-fdefault-real-10",
           "-fdefault-real-10",  and  "-fdefault-double-8"  take precedence for the default and double-precision
           real kinds, both for real literal constants and for declarations without a kind  number.   Note  that
           for  "REAL(KIND=KIND(1.0))"  the literal may get promoted and then the result may get promoted again.
           These options should be used with care and may not be suitable for your  codes.   Areas  of  possible
           concern  include  calls  to  external procedures, alignment in "EQUIVALENCE" and/or "COMMON", generic
           interfaces, BOZ literal constant conversion, and I/O and calls to intrinsic procedures when passing a
           value to the "kind=" dummy argument.  Inspection of the intermediate representation of the translated

       <b>-std=</b><u>std</u>
           Specify the standard to which the program is expected to conform, which may be  one  of  <b>f95</b>,  <b>f2003</b>,
           <b>f2008</b>,  <b>f2018</b>,  <b>gnu</b>,  or <b>legacy</b>.  The default value for <u>std</u> is <b>gnu</b>, which specifies a superset of the
           latest Fortran standard that includes all of  the  extensions  supported  by  GNU  Fortran,  although
           warnings will be given for obsolete extensions not recommended for use in new code.  The <b>legacy</b> value
           is  equivalent  but  without  the  warnings  for  obsolete extensions, and may be useful for old non-
           standard programs.  The <b>f95</b>, <b>f2003</b>, <b>f2008</b>, and <b>f2018</b> values specify strict conformance to the Fortran
           95, Fortran 2003, Fortran 2008 and Fortran 2018 standards, respectively; errors  are  given  for  all
           extensions  beyond the relevant language standard, and warnings are given for the Fortran 77 features
           that are permitted but obsolescent in later standards. The deprecated option <b>-std=f2008ts</b> acts as  an
           alias  for  <b>-std=f2018</b>. It is only present for backwards compatibility with earlier gfortran versions
           and should not be used any more.

       <b>-ftest-forall-temp</b>
           Enhance test coverage by forcing most forall assignments to use temporary.

   <b>Enable</b> <b>and</b> <b>customize</b> <b>preprocessing</b>
       Many Fortran compilers including GNU Fortran allow passing the source code through a C preprocessor (CPP;
       sometimes also called the Fortran preprocessor, FPP) to allow for conditional compilation.  In  the  case
       of  GNU Fortran, this is the GNU C Preprocessor in the traditional mode.  On systems with case-preserving
       file names, the preprocessor is automatically invoked if the filename extension is <u>.F</u>, <u>.FOR</u>, <u>.FTN</u>,  <u>.fpp</u>,
       <u>.FPP</u>,  <u>.F90</u>,  <u>.F95</u>,  <u>.F03</u> or <u>.F08</u>.  To manually invoke the preprocessor on any file, use <b>-cpp</b>, to disable
       preprocessing on files where the preprocessor is run automatically, use <b>-nocpp</b>.

       If a preprocessed file includes another file with the Fortran "INCLUDE" statement, the included  file  is
       not preprocessed.  To preprocess included files, use the equivalent preprocessor statement "#include".

       If   GNU   Fortran   invokes  the  preprocessor,  "__GFORTRAN__"  is  defined.   The  macros  "__GNUC__",
       "__GNUC_MINOR__" and "__GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__" can be used to determine the version  of  the  compiler.   See
       <b>Top,,Overview,cpp,The</b> <b>C</b> <b>Preprocessor</b> for details.

       GNU Fortran supports a number of "INTEGER" and "REAL" kind types in additional to the kind types required
       by  the  Fortran  standard.   The  availability  of  any  given kind type is architecture dependent.  The
       following pre-defined preprocessor macros can be used to conditionally include code for these  additional
       kind  types:  "__GFC_INT_1__", "__GFC_INT_2__", "__GFC_INT_8__", "__GFC_INT_16__", "__GFC_REAL_10__", and
       "__GFC_REAL_16__".

       While CPP is the de-facto standard for preprocessing Fortran code, Part 3  of  the  Fortran  95  standard
       (ISO/IEC  1539-3:1998)  defines  Conditional  Compilation,  which  is  not  widely  used and not directly
       supported by the GNU  Fortran  compiler.   You  can  use  the  program  coco  to  preprocess  such  files
       (&lt;<b><a href="http://www.daniellnagle.com/coco.html">http://www.daniellnagle.com/coco.html</a></b>&gt;).

       The following options control preprocessing of Fortran code:

       <b>-cpp</b>
       <b>-nocpp</b>
           Enable  preprocessing. The preprocessor is automatically invoked if the file extension is <u>.fpp</u>, <u>.FPP</u>,
           <u>.F</u>, <u>.FOR</u>, <u>.FTN</u>, <u>.F90</u>, <u>.F95</u>, <u>.F03</u> or <u>.F08</u>. Use this option to manually  enable  preprocessing  of  any
           kind of Fortran file.

           To  disable  preprocessing  of  files with any of the above listed extensions, use the negative form:
           <b>-nocpp</b>.

           The preprocessor is run in traditional mode. Any restrictions  of  the  file-format,  especially  the
           limits  on  line  length,  apply for preprocessed output as well, so it might be advisable to use the
           <b>-ffree-line-length-none</b> or <b>-ffixed-line-length-none</b> options.

       <b>-dM</b> Instead of the normal output, generate a list of '#define' directives  for  all  the  macros  defined
           during  the  execution  of  the  preprocessor,  including  predefined macros. This gives you a way of
           finding out what is predefined in your version of  the  preprocessor.   Assuming  you  have  no  file
           <u>foo.f90</u>, the command

                     touch foo.f90; gfortran -cpp -E -dM foo.f90

           will show all the predefined macros.

       <b>-dD</b> Like  <b>-dM</b>  except in two respects: it does not include the predefined macros, and it outputs both the
           "#define" directives and the result of preprocessing. Both kinds of output go to the standard  output
           file.

       <b>-dN</b> Like <b>-dD</b>, but emit only the macro names, not their expansions.

       <b>-dU</b> Like  <b>dD</b>  except  that  only macros that are expanded, or whose definedness is tested in preprocessor
           directives, are output; the output is delayed until the use  or  test  of  the  macro;  and  '#undef'
           directives are also output for macros tested but undefined at the time.

       <b>-dI</b> Output '#include' directives in addition to the result of preprocessing.

       <b>-fworking-directory</b>
           Enable  generation  of  linemarkers  in  the  preprocessor output that will let the compiler know the
           current working directory at the time of preprocessing. When this option is enabled, the preprocessor
           will emit, after the initial linemarker, a second  linemarker  with  the  current  working  directory
           followed  by  two slashes. GCC will use this directory, when it is present in the preprocessed input,
           as the directory emitted as the current working directory  in  some  debugging  information  formats.
           This option is implicitly enabled if debugging information is enabled, but this can be inhibited with
           the  negated  form <b>-fno-working-directory</b>. If the <b>-P</b> flag is present in the command line, this option
           has no effect, since no "#line" directives are emitted whatsoever.

       <b>-idirafter</b> <u>dir</u>
           Search <u>dir</u> for include files, but do it after all directories specified  with  <b>-I</b>  and  the  standard
           system  directories have been exhausted. <u>dir</u> is treated as a system include directory.  If dir begins
           with "=", then the "=" will be replaced by the sysroot prefix; see <b>--sysroot</b> and <b>-isysroot</b>.

       <b>-imultilib</b> <u>dir</u>
           Use <u>dir</u> as a subdirectory of the directory containing target-specific C++ headers.

       <b>-iprefix</b> <u>prefix</u>
           Specify <u>prefix</u> as the prefix  for  subsequent  <b>-iwithprefix</b>  options.  If  the  <u>prefix</u>  represents  a
           directory, you should include the final '/'.

       <b>-isysroot</b> <u>dir</u>
           This  option is like the <b>--sysroot</b> option, but applies only to header files. See the <b>--sysroot</b> option
           for more information.

       <b>-iquote</b> <u>dir</u>
           Search <u>dir</u> only for header files  requested  with  "#include  "file"";  they  are  not  searched  for
           "#include &lt;file&gt;", before all directories specified by <b>-I</b> and before the standard system directories.
           If  <u>dir</u>  begins  with  "=",  then  the  "=" will be replaced by the sysroot prefix; see <b>--sysroot</b> and
           <b>-isysroot</b>.

       <b>-isystem</b> <u>dir</u>
           Search <u>dir</u> for header files, after all directories specified by <b>-I</b> but  before  the  standard  system
           directories.  Mark it as a system directory, so that it gets the same special treatment as is applied
           to the standard system directories. If <u>dir</u> begins with "=", then the "="  will  be  replaced  by  the
           sysroot prefix; see <b>--sysroot</b> and <b>-isysroot</b>.

       <b>-nostdinc</b>
           Do  not  search  the  standard  system  directories  for  header files. Only the directories you have
           specified with <b>-I</b> options (and the directory of the current file, if appropriate) are searched.

       <b>-undef</b>
           Do not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros.  The standard predefined  macros  remain
           defined.

       <b>-A</b><u>predicate</u><b>=</b><u>answer</u>
           Make  an  assertion  with  the  predicate <u>predicate</u> and answer <u>answer</u>.  This form is preferred to the
           older form -A predicate(answer), which is still supported, because it  does  not  use  shell  special
           characters.

       <b>-A-</b><u>predicate</u><b>=</b><u>answer</u>
           Cancel an assertion with the predicate <u>predicate</u> and answer <u>answer</u>.

       <b>-C</b>  Do  not  discard comments. All comments are passed through to the output file, except for comments in
           processed directives, which are deleted along with the directive.

           You should be prepared for side effects when using <b>-C</b>; it causes the preprocessor to  treat  comments
           as  tokens  in  their  own  right.  For  example,  comments appearing at the start of what would be a
           directive line have the effect of turning that line into an ordinary source  line,  since  the  first
           token on the line is no longer a '#'.

           Warning:  this  currently  handles  C-Style  comments  only.  The preprocessor does not yet recognize
           Fortran-style comments.

       <b>-CC</b> Do not discard comments, including during macro expansion. This is  like  <b>-C</b>,  except  that  comments
           contained within macros are also passed through to the output file where the macro is expanded.

           In addition to the side-effects of the <b>-C</b> option, the <b>-CC</b> option causes all C++-style comments inside
           a  macro  to  be  converted  to  C-style  comments.  This  is to prevent later use of that macro from
           inadvertently commenting out the remainder of the source line. The <b>-CC</b> option is  generally  used  to
           support lint comments.

           Warning:  this  currently  handles  C-  and  C++-Style  comments  only. The preprocessor does not yet
           recognize Fortran-style comments.

       <b>-D</b><u>name</u>
           Predefine name as a macro, with definition 1.

       <b>-D</b><u>name</u><b>=</b><u>definition</u>
           The contents of <u>definition</u> are tokenized and processed as if they appeared during  translation  phase
           three  in a '#define' directive.  In particular, the definition will be truncated by embedded newline
           characters.

           If you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like program  you  may  need  to  use  the
           shell's quoting syntax to protect characters such as spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax.

           If  you  wish  to  define  a  function-like  macro  on the command line, write its argument list with
           surrounding parentheses before the equals sign (if any). Parentheses are meaningful to  most  shells,
           so you will need to quote the option. With sh and csh, "-D'name(args...)=definition'" works.

           <b>-D</b>  and  <b>-U</b>  options are processed in the order they are given on the command line. All -imacros file
           and -include file options are processed after all -D and -U options.

       <b>-H</b>  Print the name of each header file used, in  addition  to  other  normal  activities.  Each  name  is
           indented to show how deep in the '#include' stack it is.

       <b>-P</b>  Inhibit  generation  of  linemarkers  in the output from the preprocessor.  This might be useful when
           running the preprocessor on something that is not C code, and will be sent to a program  which  might
           be confused by the linemarkers.

       <b>-U</b><u>name</u>
           Cancel any previous definition of <u>name</u>, either built in or provided with a <b>-D</b> option.

   <b>Options</b> <b>to</b> <b>request</b> <b>or</b> <b>suppress</b> <b>errors</b> <b>and</b> <b>warnings</b>
       Errors  are  diagnostic  messages  that  report that the GNU Fortran compiler cannot compile the relevant
       piece of source code.  The compiler will continue to process the program in an attempt to report  further
       errors to aid in debugging, but will not produce any compiled output.

       Warnings  are  diagnostic messages that report constructions which are not inherently erroneous but which
       are risky or suggest there is likely to be a bug in the program.  Unless <b>-Werror</b> is  specified,  they  do
       not prevent compilation of the program.

       You  can  request  many  specific  warnings  with options beginning <b>-W</b>, for example <b>-Wimplicit</b> to request
       warnings on implicit declarations.  Each of these specific warning  options  also  has  a  negative  form
       beginning  <b>-Wno-</b> to turn off warnings; for example, <b>-Wno-implicit</b>.  This manual lists only one of the two
       forms, whichever is not the default.

       These options control the amount and kinds of errors and warnings produced by GNU Fortran:

       <b>-fmax-errors=</b><u>n</u>
           Limits the maximum number of error messages to <u>n</u>, at which point GNU Fortran bails  out  rather  than
           attempting  to  continue  processing  the source code.  If <u>n</u> is 0, there is no limit on the number of
           error messages produced.

       <b>-fsyntax-only</b>
           Check the code for syntax errors, but do not actually compile it.  This will  generate  module  files
           for each module present in the code, but no other output file.

       <b>-Wpedantic</b>
       <b>-pedantic</b>
           Issue  warnings  for  uses of extensions to Fortran.  <b>-pedantic</b> also applies to C-language constructs
           where they occur in GNU Fortran source files, such as use of <b>\e</b> in  a  character  constant  within  a
           directive like "#include".

           Valid  Fortran  programs  should compile properly with or without this option.  However, without this
           option, certain GNU extensions and traditional Fortran features are supported  as  well.   With  this
           option, many of them are rejected.

           Some  users  try to use <b>-pedantic</b> to check programs for conformance.  They soon find that it does not
           do quite what they want---it finds some nonstandard practices, but not all.  However, improvements to
           GNU Fortran in this area are welcome.

           This should be used in conjunction with <b>-std=f95</b>, <b>-std=f2003</b>, <b>-std=f2008</b> or <b>-std=f2018</b>.

       <b>-pedantic-errors</b>
           Like <b>-pedantic</b>, except that errors are produced rather than warnings.

       <b>-Wall</b>
           Enables commonly used warning options pertaining to usage that we  recommend  avoiding  and  that  we
           believe   are  easy  to  avoid.   This  currently  includes  <b>-Waliasing</b>,  <b>-Wampersand</b>,  <b>-Wconversion</b>,
           <b>-Wsurprising</b>,  <b>-Wc-binding-type</b>,  <b>-Wintrinsics-std</b>,  <b>-Wtabs</b>,  <b>-Wintrinsic-shadow</b>,  <b>-Wline-truncation</b>,
           <b>-Wtarget-lifetime</b>, <b>-Winteger-division</b>, <b>-Wreal-q-constant</b>, <b>-Wunused</b> and <b>-Wundefined-do-loop</b>.

       <b>-Waliasing</b>
           Warn  about  possible aliasing of dummy arguments. Specifically, it warns if the same actual argument
           is associated with a dummy argument with INTENT(IN) and a dummy argument with INTENT(OUT) in  a  call
           with an explicit interface.

           The following example will trigger the warning.

                     interface
                       subroutine bar(a,b)
                         integer, intent(in) :: a
                         integer, intent(out) :: b
                       end subroutine
                     end interface
                     integer :: a

                     call bar(a,a)

       <b>-Wampersand</b>
           Warn about missing ampersand in continued character constants. The warning is given with <b>-Wampersand</b>,
           <b>-pedantic</b>,  <b>-std=f95</b>,  <b>-std=f2003</b>,  <b>-std=f2008</b>  and  <b>-std=f2018</b>.  Note:  With no ampersand given in a
           continued character constant, GNU  Fortran  assumes  continuation  at  the  first  non-comment,  non-
           whitespace character after the ampersand that initiated the continuation.

       <b>-Warray-temporaries</b>
           Warn about array temporaries generated by the compiler.  The information generated by this warning is
           sometimes useful in optimization, in order to avoid such temporaries.

       <b>-Wc-binding-type</b>
           Warn  if  the  a variable might not be C interoperable.  In particular, warn if the variable has been
           declared using an intrinsic type with default kind instead of using a kind parameter  defined  for  C
           interoperability in the intrinsic "ISO_C_Binding" module.  This option is implied by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wcharacter-truncation</b>
           Warn when a character assignment will truncate the assigned string.

       <b>-Wline-truncation</b>
           Warn  when  a  source  code  line will be truncated.  This option is implied by <b>-Wall</b>.  For free-form
           source code, the default is <b>-Werror=line-truncation</b> such that truncations are reported as error.

       <b>-Wconversion</b>
           Warn about implicit conversions that  are  likely  to  change  the  value  of  the  expression  after
           conversion. Implied by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wconversion-extra</b>
           Warn  about  implicit  conversions  between  different  types  and  kinds. This option does <u>not</u> imply
           <b>-Wconversion</b>.

       <b>-Wextra</b>
           Enables some warning options for usages of language features which may be problematic. This currently
           includes <b>-Wcompare-reals</b>, <b>-Wunused-parameter</b> and <b>-Wdo-subscript</b>.

       <b>-Wfrontend-loop-interchange</b>
           Warn when using <b>-ffrontend-loop-interchange</b> for performing loop interchanges.

       <b>-Wimplicit-interface</b>
           Warn if a procedure is called without an explicit interface.  Note this only checks that an  explicit
           interface  is  present.  It does not check that the declared interfaces are consistent across program
           units.

       <b>-Wimplicit-procedure</b>
           Warn if a procedure is called that has neither  an  explicit  interface  nor  has  been  declared  as
           "EXTERNAL".

       <b>-Winteger-division</b>
           Warn if a constant integer division truncates its result.  As an example, 3/5 evaluates to 0.

       <b>-Wintrinsics-std</b>
           Warn  if  <b>gfortran</b>  finds a procedure named like an intrinsic not available in the currently selected
           standard (with <b>-std</b>) and treats it as "EXTERNAL" procedure because of this.  <b>-fall-intrinsics</b> can  be
           used  to  never  trigger  this  behavior  and always link to the intrinsic regardless of the selected
           standard.

       <b>-Wno-overwrite-recursive</b>
           Do not warn when <b>-fno-automatic</b> is used with <b>-frecursive</b>. Recursion will be broken  if  the  relevant
           local variables do not have the attribute "AUTOMATIC" explicitly declared. This option can be used to
           suppress  the  warning  when  it is known that recursion is not broken. Useful for build environments
           that use <b>-Werror</b>.

       <b>-Wreal-q-constant</b>
           Produce a warning if a real-literal-constant contains a "q" exponent-letter.

       <b>-Wsurprising</b>
           Produce a warning when "suspicious" code constructs are encountered.  While technically  legal  these
           usually indicate that an error has been made.

           This currently produces a warning under the following circumstances:

           *   An  INTEGER  SELECT  construct has a CASE that can never be matched as its lower value is greater
               than its upper value.

           *   A LOGICAL SELECT construct has three CASE statements.

           *   A TRANSFER specifies a source that is shorter than the destination.

           *   The type of a function result is declared more than once with the same  type.   If  <b>-pedantic</b>  or
               standard-conforming mode is enabled, this is an error.

           *   A "CHARACTER" variable is declared with negative length.

           *   With   <b>-fopenmp</b>,  for  fixed-form  source  code,  when  an  "omx"  vendor-extension  sentinel  is
               encountered. (The equivalent "ompx", used in free-form source code, is diagnosed by default.)

       <b>-Wtabs</b>
           By default, tabs are accepted as whitespace, but tabs are not members of the Fortran  Character  Set.
           For  continuation lines, a tab followed by a digit between 1 and 9 is supported.  <b>-Wtabs</b> will cause a
           warning to be issued if a tab is  encountered.  Note,  <b>-Wtabs</b>  is  active  for  <b>-pedantic</b>,  <b>-std=f95</b>,
           <b>-std=f2003</b>, <b>-std=f2008</b>, <b>-std=f2018</b> and <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wundefined-do-loop</b>
           Warn  if a DO loop with step either 1 or -1 yields an underflow or an overflow during iteration of an
           induction variable of the loop.  This option is implied by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wunderflow</b>
           Produce a warning when numerical constant expressions  are  encountered,  which  yield  an  UNDERFLOW
           during compilation. Enabled by default.

       <b>-Wintrinsic-shadow</b>
           Warn if a user-defined procedure or module procedure has the same name as an intrinsic; in this case,
           an  explicit  interface  or  "EXTERNAL" or "INTRINSIC" declaration might be needed to get calls later
           resolved to the desired intrinsic/procedure.  This option is implied by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wuse-without-only</b>
           Warn if a "USE" statement has no "ONLY" qualifier and thus implicitly imports all public entities  of
           the used module.

       <b>-Wunused-dummy-argument</b>
           Warn about unused dummy arguments. This option is implied by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wunused-parameter</b>
           Contrary  to  <b>gcc</b>'s  meaning of <b>-Wunused-parameter</b>, <b>gfortran</b>'s implementation of this option does not
           warn about unused dummy arguments (see <b>-Wunused-dummy-argument</b>), but about unused "PARAMETER" values.
           <b>-Wunused-parameter</b> is implied by <b>-Wextra</b> if also <b>-Wunused</b> or <b>-Wall</b> is used.

       <b>-Walign-commons</b>
           By default, <b>gfortran</b> warns about any occasion of variables being padded for proper alignment inside a
           "COMMON" block. This warning can be turned off via <b>-Wno-align-commons</b>. See also <b>-falign-commons</b>.

       <b>-Wfunction-elimination</b>
           Warn if  any  calls  to  impure  functions  are  eliminated  by  the  optimizations  enabled  by  the
           <b>-ffrontend-optimize</b> option.  This option is implied by <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-Wrealloc-lhs</b>
           Warn  when  the  compiler might insert code to for allocation or reallocation of an allocatable array
           variable of intrinsic type in intrinsic assignments.  In hot loops,  the  Fortran  2003  reallocation
           feature  may  reduce  the  performance.   If  the  array is already allocated with the correct shape,
           consider using a whole-array array-spec (e.g. "(:,:,:)") for the variable on the  left-hand  side  to
           prevent  the  reallocation  check. Note that in some cases the warning is shown, even if the compiler
           will optimize reallocation checks away.  For instance, when the right-hand  side  contains  the  same
           variable multiplied by a scalar.  See also <b>-frealloc-lhs</b>.

       <b>-Wrealloc-lhs-all</b>
           Warn  when  the  compiler  inserts code to for allocation or reallocation of an allocatable variable;
           this includes scalars and derived types.

       <b>-Wcompare-reals</b>
           Warn when comparing real or complex types for equality or inequality.   This  option  is  implied  by
           <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-Wtarget-lifetime</b>
           Warn  if  the  pointer  in  a  pointer assignment might be longer than the its target. This option is
           implied by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wzerotrip</b>
           Warn if a "DO" loop is known to execute zero times at compile time.  This option is implied by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wdo-subscript</b>
           Warn if an array subscript inside a DO loop could  lead  to  an  out-of-bounds  access  even  if  the
           compiler cannot prove that the statement is actually executed, in cases like

                     real <a href="../man3/a.3.html">a</a>(3)
                     do i=1,4
                       if (condition(i)) then
                         a(i) = 1.2
                       end if
                     end do

           This option is implied by <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-Werror</b>
           Turns all warnings into errors.

       Some of these have no effect when compiling programs written in Fortran.

   <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>debugging</b> <b>your</b> <b>program</b> <b>or</b> <b>GNU</b> <b>Fortran</b>
       GNU  Fortran  has  various  special  options  that  are used for debugging either your program or the GNU
       Fortran compiler.

       <b>-fdump-fortran-original</b>
           Output the internal parse tree after translating the source  program  into  internal  representation.
           This  option  is mostly useful for debugging the GNU Fortran compiler itself. The output generated by
           this option might change between releases. This option may also generate internal compiler errors for
           features which have only recently been added.

       <b>-fdump-fortran-optimized</b>
           Output the parse tree after front-end optimization.  Mostly useful  for  debugging  the  GNU  Fortran
           compiler  itself. The output generated by this option might change between releases.  This option may
           also generate internal compiler errors for features which have only recently been added.

       <b>-fdump-parse-tree</b>
           Output the internal parse tree after translating the source  program  into  internal  representation.
           Mostly  useful  for  debugging  the  GNU Fortran compiler itself. The output generated by this option
           might change between releases. This option may also generate internal compiler  errors  for  features
           which  have  only  recently  been  added.  This  option  is deprecated; use "-fdump-fortran-original"
           instead.

       <b>-fdebug-aux-vars</b>
           Renames internal variables created by the gfortran front end and makes them accessible to a debugger.
           The name of the internal variables then start with upper-case  letters  followed  by  an  underscore.
           This   option   is   useful   for   debugging   the   compiler's   code   generation   together  with
           "-fdump-tree-original" and enabling debugging of the executable program by using "-g" or "-ggdb3".

       <b>-fdump-fortran-global</b>
           Output a list of the global identifiers after  translating  into  middle-end  representation.  Mostly
           useful  for  debugging  the  GNU  Fortran  compiler itself. The output generated by this option might
           change between releases.  This option may also generate internal compiler errors for  features  which
           have only recently been added.

       <b>-ffpe-trap=</b><u>list</u>
           Specify  a  list  of  floating point exception traps to enable.  On most systems, if a floating point
           exception occurs and the trap for that exception is enabled, a SIGFPE signal will  be  sent  and  the
           program being aborted, producing a core file useful for debugging.  <u>list</u> is a (possibly empty) comma-
           separated  list  of  the  following  exceptions:  <b>invalid</b>  (invalid floating point operation, such as
           SQRT(-1.0)), <b>zero</b> (division by zero), <b>overflow</b> (overflow in a floating  point  operation),  <b>underflow</b>
           (underflow in a floating point operation), <b>inexact</b> (loss of precision during operation), and <b>denormal</b>
           (operation performed on a denormal value).  The first five exceptions correspond to the five IEEE 754
           exceptions,  whereas the last one (<b>denormal</b>) is not part of the IEEE 754 standard but is available on
           some common architectures such as x86.

           The first three exceptions (<b>invalid</b>, <b>zero</b>, and <b>overflow</b>) often indicate serious  errors,  and  unless
           the  program  has  provisions  for  dealing  with  these  exceptions,  enabling traps for these three
           exceptions is probably a good idea.

           If  the  option  is  used  more  than  once  in  the  command  line,  the  lists  will   be   joined:
           '"ffpe-trap="<u>list1</u> "ffpe-trap="<u>list2</u>' is equivalent to "ffpe-trap="<u>list1</u>,<u>list2</u>.

           Note that once enabled an exception cannot be disabled (no negative form).

           Many,  if  not most, floating point operations incur loss of precision due to rounding, and hence the
           "ffpe-trap=inexact" is likely to be uninteresting in practice.

           By default no exception traps are enabled.

       <b>-ffpe-summary=</b><u>list</u>
           Specify a list of floating-point exceptions, whose  flag  status  is  printed  to  "ERROR_UNIT"  when
           invoking  "STOP"  and  "ERROR  STOP".   <u>list</u> can be either <b>none</b>, <b>all</b> or a comma-separated list of the
           following exceptions: <b>invalid</b>, <b>zero</b>, <b>overflow</b>, <b>underflow</b>, <b>inexact</b> and <b>denormal</b>. (See <b>-ffpe-trap</b> for a
           description of the exceptions.)

           If the option is used more than once in the command line, only the last one will be used.

           By default, a summary for all exceptions but <b>inexact</b> is shown.

       <b>-fno-backtrace</b>
           When a serious runtime error is encountered or  a  deadly  signal  is  emitted  (segmentation  fault,
           illegal  instruction,  bus error, floating-point exception, and the other POSIX signals that have the
           action <b>core</b>), the Fortran runtime library tries to output a backtrace of the error.  "-fno-backtrace"
           disables the backtrace generation. This option only has influence for compilation of the Fortran main
           program.

   <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>directory</b> <b>search</b>
       These options affect how GNU Fortran searches for files specified by the "INCLUDE" directive and where it
       searches for previously compiled modules.

       It also affects the search paths used by <b>cpp</b> when used to preprocess Fortran source.

       <b>-I</b><u>dir</u>
           These affect interpretation of the "INCLUDE" directive (as well as of the "#include" directive of the
           <b>cpp</b> preprocessor).

           Also  note  that  the  general  behavior  of  <b>-I</b>  and "INCLUDE" is pretty much the same as of <b>-I</b> with
           "#include" in the <b>cpp</b> preprocessor, with regard to  looking  for  <u>header.gcc</u>  files  and  other  such
           things.

           This  path  is  also used to search for <u>.mod</u> files when previously compiled modules are required by a
           "USE" statement.

       <b>-J</b><u>dir</u>
           This option specifies where to put <u>.mod</u> files for compiled modules.  It is also added to the list  of
           directories to searched by an "USE" statement.

           The default is the current directory.

       <b>-fintrinsic-modules-path</b> <u>dir</u>
           This  option specifies the location of pre-compiled intrinsic modules, if they are not in the default
           location expected by the compiler.

   <b>Influencing</b> <b>the</b> <b>linking</b> <b>step</b>
       These options come into play when the compiler links object files into an executable  output  file.  They
       are meaningless if the compiler is not doing a link step.

       <b>-static-libgfortran</b>
           On  systems  that provide <u>libgfortran</u> as a shared and a static library, this option forces the use of
           the static version. If no shared version of <u>libgfortran</u> was built when the compiler  was  configured,
           this option has no effect.

       <b>-static-libquadmath</b>
           On  systems  that provide <u>libquadmath</u> as a shared and a static library, this option forces the use of
           the static version. If no shared version of <u>libquadmath</u> was built when the compiler  was  configured,
           this option has no effect.

           Please  note  that  the  <u>libquadmath</u>  runtime library is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public
           License (LGPL), and linking it statically introduces requirements when redistributing  the  resulting
           binaries.

   <b>Influencing</b> <b>runtime</b> <b>behavior</b>
       These options affect the runtime behavior of programs compiled with GNU Fortran.

       <b>-fconvert=</b><u>conversion</u>
           Specify  the  representation  of  data  for  unformatted  files.  Valid values for conversion on most
           systems are: <b>native</b>, the default; <b>swap</b>, swap between big- and  little-endian;  <b>big-endian</b>,  use  big-
           endian  representation  for  unformatted  files;  <b>little-endian</b>, use little-endian representation for
           unformatted files.

           On POWER systems which suppport <b>-mabi=ieeelongdouble</b>, there are  additional  options,  which  can  be
           combined with others with commas.  Those are

           @w&lt;<b>-fconvert=r16_ieee</b> Use IEEE 128-bit format for&gt;
               REAL(KIND=16).

           @w&lt;<b>-fconvert=r16_ibm</b> Use IBM long double format for&gt;
               REAL(KIND=16).

           <u>This</u>  <u>option</u>  <u>has</u>  <u>an</u>  <u>effect</u>  <u>only</u>  <u>when</u>  <u>used</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>main</u> <u>program.</u>  <u>The</u> <u>"CONVERT"</u> <u>specifier</u> <u>and</u> <u>the</u>
           <u>GFORTRAN_CONVERT_UNIT</u> <u>environment</u> <u>variable</u> <u>override</u> <u>the</u> <u>default</u> <u>specified</u> <u>by</u> <u><b>-fconvert</b>.</u>

       <b>-frecord-marker=</b><u>length</u>
           Specify the length of record markers for unformatted files.  Valid values for <u>length</u>  are  4  and  8.
           Default is 4.  <u>This</u> <u>is</u> <u>different</u> <u>from</u> <u>previous</u> <u>versions</u> <u>of</u> <b>gfortran</b>, which specified a default record
           marker  length  of  8  on  most  systems.  If you want to read or write files compatible with earlier
           versions of <b>gfortran</b>, use <b>-frecord-marker=8</b>.

       <b>-fmax-subrecord-length=</b><u>length</u>
           Specify the maximum length for a subrecord.  The maximum permitted value for  length  is  2147483639,
           which is also the default.  Only really useful for use by the gfortran testsuite.

       <b>-fsign-zero</b>
           When  enabled,  floating  point  numbers  of value zero with the sign bit set are written as negative
           number in formatted output and treated as negative in the "SIGN" intrinsic.  <b>-fno-sign-zero</b> does  not
           print  the  negative  sign  of  zero  values  (or values rounded to zero for I/O) and regards zero as
           positive number  in  the  "SIGN"  intrinsic  for  compatibility  with  Fortran  77.  The  default  is
           <b>-fsign-zero</b>.

   <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>code</b> <b>generation</b> <b>conventions</b>
       These machine-independent options control the interface conventions used in code generation.

       Most of them have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of <b>-ffoo</b> would be <b>-fno-foo</b>.  In the
       table  below, only one of the forms is listed---the one which is not the default.  You can figure out the
       other form by either removing <b>no-</b> or adding it.

       <b>-fno-automatic</b>
           Treat each program unit (except those marked as RECURSIVE) as if the "SAVE" statement were  specified
           for  every  local  variable  and array referenced in it. Does not affect common blocks. (Some Fortran
           compilers provide this option under the name <b>-static</b> or <b>-save</b>.)  The default, which  is  <b>-fautomatic</b>,
           uses  the  stack  for  local variables smaller than the value given by <b>-fmax-stack-var-size</b>.  Use the
           option <b>-frecursive</b> to use no static memory.

           Local variables or arrays having an  explicit  "SAVE"  attribute  are  silently  ignored  unless  the
           <b>-pedantic</b> option is added.

       <b>-ff2c</b>
           Generate code designed to be compatible with code generated by <b>g77</b> and <b>f2c</b>.

           The  calling  conventions  used  by <b>g77</b> (originally implemented in <b>f2c</b>) require functions that return
           type default "REAL" to actually return the C type "double", and functions that return type  "COMPLEX"
           to  return the values via an extra argument in the calling sequence that points to where to store the
           return value.  Under the default GNU calling conventions, such functions simply return their  results
           as  they would in GNU C---default "REAL" functions return the C type "float", and "COMPLEX" functions
           return the GNU C type "complex".  Additionally, this option implies the  <b>-fsecond-underscore</b>  option,
           unless <b>-fno-second-underscore</b> is explicitly requested.

           This does not affect the generation of code that interfaces with the <b>libgfortran</b> library.

           <u>Caution:</u>  It  is  not a good idea to mix Fortran code compiled with <b>-ff2c</b> with code compiled with the
           default <b>-fno-f2c</b> calling conventions as,  calling  "COMPLEX"  or  default  "REAL"  functions  between
           program parts which were compiled with different calling conventions will break at execution time.

           <u>Caution:</u> This will break code which passes intrinsic functions of type default "REAL" or "COMPLEX" as
           actual arguments, as the library implementations use the <b>-fno-f2c</b> calling conventions.

       <b>-fno-underscoring</b>
           Do  not  transform names of entities specified in the Fortran source file by appending underscores to
           them.

           With <b>-funderscoring</b> in effect, GNU Fortran appends one underscore to external names.  This is done to
           ensure compatibility with code produced by many UNIX Fortran compilers.

           <u>Caution</u>: The default behavior of GNU Fortran is incompatible with <b>f2c</b> and <b>g77</b>, please use  the  <b>-ff2c</b>
           option  if  you want object files compiled with GNU Fortran to be compatible with object code created
           with these tools.

           Use of <b>-fno-underscoring</b> is not  recommended  unless  you  are  experimenting  with  issues  such  as
           integration  of  GNU  Fortran into existing system environments (vis-à-vis existing libraries, tools,
           and so on).

           For example, with <b>-funderscoring</b>, and assuming that j() and max_count() are external functions  while
           "my_var" and "lvar" are local variables, a statement like

                   I = J() + MAX_COUNT (MY_VAR, LVAR)

           is implemented as something akin to:

                   i = j_() + max_count_(&amp;my_var, &amp;lvar);

           With <b>-fno-underscoring</b>, the same statement is implemented as:

                   i = j() + max_count(&amp;my_var, &amp;lvar);

           Use  of  <b>-fno-underscoring</b> allows direct specification of user-defined names while debugging and when
           interfacing GNU Fortran code with other languages.

           Note that just because the names match does <u>not</u> mean that the interface implemented  by  GNU  Fortran
           for  an  external  name  matches the interface implemented by some other language for that same name.
           That is, getting code produced by GNU Fortran to link to code produced by some other  compiler  using
           this  or  any  other  method  can  be  only  a  small part of the overall solution---getting the code
           generated by both compilers to agree on issues other than naming can require significant effort, and,
           unlike naming disagreements, linkers normally cannot detect disagreements in these other areas.

           Also, note that with <b>-fno-underscoring</b>, the lack of appended underscores  introduces  the  very  real
           possibility  that  a  user-defined external name will conflict with a name in a system library, which
           could make finding unresolved-reference bugs quite difficult in  some  cases---they  might  occur  at
           program run time, and show up only as buggy behavior at run time.

           In  future  versions  of  GNU  Fortran we hope to improve naming and linking issues so that debugging
           always involves using the names as they appear in the source, even if the names as seen by the linker
           are mangled to prevent accidental linking between procedures with incompatible interfaces.

       <b>-fsecond-underscore</b>
           By default, GNU Fortran appends an underscore to external names.  If this option is used GNU  Fortran
           appends  two  underscores  to  names  with  underscores  and one underscore to external names with no
           underscores.  GNU Fortran also appends two underscores to internal names with  underscores  to  avoid
           naming collisions with external names.

           This option has no effect if <b>-fno-underscoring</b> is in effect.  It is implied by the <b>-ff2c</b> option.

           Otherwise,  with  this  option, an external name such as "MAX_COUNT" is implemented as a reference to
           the link-time  external  symbol  "max_count__",  instead  of  "max_count_".   This  is  required  for
           compatibility with <b>g77</b> and <b>f2c</b>, and is implied by use of the <b>-ff2c</b> option.

       <b>-fcoarray=</b><u>&lt;keyword&gt;</u>
           <b>none</b>
               Disable  coarray  support; using coarray declarations and image-control statements will produce a
               compile-time error. (Default)

           <b>single</b>
               Single-image mode, i.e. num_images() is always one.

           <b>lib</b> Library-based coarray parallelization; a suitable GNU Fortran coarray library needs to be linked.

       <b>-fcheck=</b><u>&lt;keyword&gt;</u>
           Enable the generation of run-time checks; the  argument  shall  be  a  comma-delimited  list  of  the
           following  keywords.   Prefixing  a  check  with  <b>no-</b>  disables  it if it was activated by a previous
           specification.

           <b>all</b> Enable all run-time test of <b>-fcheck</b>.

           <b>array-temps</b>
               Warns at run time when for passing an actual argument a temporary array had to be generated.  The
               information generated by this warning is sometimes useful in optimization, in order to avoid such
               temporaries.

               Note: The warning is only printed once per location.

           <b>bits</b>
               Enable generation of run-time checks for invalid arguments to the bit manipulation intrinsics.

           <b>bounds</b>
               Enable  generation  of  run-time checks for array subscripts and against the declared minimum and
               maximum values.  It also checks array indices for assumed and deferred shape arrays  against  the
               actual  allocated  bounds  and  ensures  that  all  string  lengths are equal for character array
               constructors without an explicit typespec.

               Some checks require that <b>-fcheck=bounds</b> is set for the compilation of the main program.

               Note: In the future this may also include other  forms  of  checking,  e.g.,  checking  substring
               references.

           <b>do</b>  Enable generation of run-time checks for invalid modification of loop iteration variables.

           <b>mem</b> Enable  generation  of  run-time checks for memory allocation.  Note: This option does not affect
               explicit allocations using the "ALLOCATE" statement, which will be always checked.

           <b>pointer</b>
               Enable generation of run-time checks for pointers and allocatables.

           <b>recursion</b>
               Enable generation of run-time checks for recursively called subroutines and functions  which  are
               not  marked  as  recursive.  See  also  <b>-frecursive</b>.   Note:  This check does not work for OpenMP
               programs and is disabled if used together with <b>-frecursive</b> and <b>-fopenmp</b>.

           Example: Assuming you have a file <u>foo.f90</u>, the command

                     gfortran -fcheck=all,no-array-temps foo.f90

           will compile the file with all checks enabled as specified above except warnings for generated  array
           temporaries.

       <b>-fbounds-check</b>
           Deprecated alias for <b>-fcheck=bounds</b>.

       <b>-ftail-call-workaround</b>
       <b>-ftail-call-workaround=</b><u>n</u>
           Some  C  interfaces to Fortran codes violate the gfortran ABI by omitting the hidden character length
           arguments as described in
             This can lead to crashes because pushing arguments for tail calls can overflow the stack.

           To provide a workaround for existing binary packages, this option disables tail call optimization for
           gfortran procedures with character arguments.  With <b>-ftail-call-workaround=2</b> tail  call  optimization
           is  disabled  in  all  gfortran procedures with character arguments, with <b>-ftail-call-workaround=1</b> or
           equivalent <b>-ftail-call-workaround</b> only in gfortran procedures  with  character  arguments  that  call
           implicitly prototyped procedures.

           Using this option can lead to problems including crashes due to insufficient stack space.

           It  is <u>very</u> <u>strongly</u> recommended to fix the code in question.  The <b>-fc-prototypes-external</b> option can
           be used to generate prototypes which conform to gfortran's ABI, for inclusion in the source code.

           Support for this option will likely be withdrawn in a future release of gfortran.

           The negative form, <b>-fno-tail-call-workaround</b> or equivalent <b>-ftail-call-workaround=0</b>, can be  used  to
           disable this option.

           Default is currently <b>-ftail-call-workaround</b>, this will change in future releases.

       <b>-fcheck-array-temporaries</b>
           Deprecated alias for <b>-fcheck=array-temps</b>.

       <b>-fmax-array-constructor=</b><u>n</u>
           This  option can be used to increase the upper limit permitted in array constructors.  The code below
           requires this option to expand the array at compile time.

                   program test
                   implicit none
                   integer j
                   integer, parameter :: n = 100000
                   integer, parameter :: i(n) = (/ (2*j, j = 1, n) /)
                   print '(10(I0,1X))', i
                   end program test

           <u>Caution:</u>  <u>This</u> <u>option</u> <u>can</u> <u>lead</u> <u>to</u> <u>long</u> <u>compile</u> <u>times</u> <u>and</u> <u>excessively</u> <u>large</u> <u>object</u> <u>files.</u>

           The default value for <u>n</u> is 65535.

       <b>-fmax-stack-var-size=</b><u>n</u>
           This option specifies the size in bytes of the largest array that will be put on the  stack;  if  the
           size  is  exceeded  static  memory is used (except in procedures marked as RECURSIVE). Use the option
           <b>-frecursive</b> to allow for recursive procedures which do not have a RECURSIVE attribute or for parallel
           programs. Use <b>-fno-automatic</b> to never use the stack.

           This option currently only affects local arrays declared with constant bounds, and may not  apply  to
           all character variables.  Future versions of GNU Fortran may improve this behavior.

           The default value for <u>n</u> is 65536.

       <b>-fstack-arrays</b>
           Adding  this  option  will  make  the  Fortran  compiler  put  all  arrays  of unknown size and array
           temporaries onto stack memory.  If your program uses very large local arrays it is possible that  you
           will  have  to  extend  your  runtime limits for stack memory on some operating systems. This flag is
           enabled by default at optimization level <b>-Ofast</b> unless <b>-fmax-stack-var-size</b> is specified.

       <b>-fpack-derived</b>
           This option tells GNU Fortran to pack derived type members as closely  as  possible.   Code  compiled
           with this option is likely to be incompatible with code compiled without this option, and may execute
           slower.

       <b>-frepack-arrays</b>
           In some circumstances GNU Fortran may pass assumed shape array sections via a descriptor describing a
           noncontiguous area of memory.  This option adds code to the function prologue to repack the data into
           a contiguous block at runtime.

           This should result in faster accesses to the array.  However it can introduce significant overhead to
           the function call, especially  when the passed data is noncontiguous.

       <b>-fshort-enums</b>
           This  option  is  provided  for interoperability with C code that was compiled with the <b>-fshort-enums</b>
           option.  It will make GNU Fortran choose the smallest "INTEGER" kind a given enumerator set will  fit
           in, and give all its enumerators this kind.

       <b>-finline-arg-packing</b>
           When  passing  an  assumed-shape  argument  of  a  procedure as actual argument to an assumed-size or
           explicit size or as argument to a procedure that does not have an explicit  interface,  the  argument
           may have to be packed, that is put into contiguous memory. An example is the call to "foo" in

                     subroutine foo(a)
                        real, dimension(*) :: a
                     end subroutine foo
                     subroutine bar(b)
                        real, dimension(:) :: b
                        call foo(b)
                     end subroutine bar

           When  <b>-finline-arg-packing</b>  is  in effect, this packing will be performed by inline code. This allows
           for more optimization while increasing code size.

           <b>-finline-arg-packing</b> is implied by any of the <b>-O</b> options except when optimizing for size via <b>-Os</b>.  If
           the code contains a very large number of argument  that  have  to  be  packed,  code  size  and  also
           compilation time may become excessive.  If that is the case, it may be better to disable this option.
           Instances of packing can be found by using <b>-Warray-temporaries</b>.

       <b>-fexternal-blas</b>
           This  option  will  make  <b>gfortran</b>  generate  calls to BLAS functions for some matrix operations like
           "MATMUL", instead of using our own algorithms, if the size of the matrices involved is larger than  a
           given limit (see <b>-fblas-matmul-limit</b>).  This may be profitable if an optimized vendor BLAS library is
           available.  The BLAS library will have to be specified at link time.

       <b>-fblas-matmul-limit=</b><u>n</u>
           Only  significant  when  <b>-fexternal-blas</b>  is  in effect.  Matrix multiplication of matrices with size
           larger than (or equal to) <u>n</u> will be performed by calls  to  BLAS  functions,  while  others  will  be
           handled by <b>gfortran</b> internal algorithms. If the matrices involved are not square, the size comparison
           is performed using the geometric mean of the dimensions of the argument and result matrices.

           The default value for <u>n</u> is 30.

       <b>-finline-matmul-limit=</b><u>n</u>
           When front-end optimization is active, some calls to the "MATMUL" intrinsic function will be inlined.
           This may result in code size increase if the size of the matrix cannot be determined at compile time,
           as  code for both cases is generated.  Setting "-finline-matmul-limit=0" will disable inlining in all
           cases.  Setting this option with a value of <u>n</u> will produce inline code for matrices with size  up  to
           <u>n</u>. If the matrices involved are not square, the size comparison is performed using the geometric mean
           of the dimensions of the argument and result matrices.

           The default value for <u>n</u> is 30.  The "-fblas-matmul-limit" can be used to change this value.

       <b>-frecursive</b>
           Allow  indirect  recursion by forcing all local arrays to be allocated on the stack. This flag cannot
           be used together with <b>-fmax-stack-var-size=</b> or <b>-fno-automatic</b>.

       <b>-finit-local-zero</b>
       <b>-finit-derived</b>
       <b>-finit-integer=</b><u>n</u>
       <b>-finit-real=</b><u>&lt;zero|inf|-inf|nan|snan&gt;</u>
       <b>-finit-logical=</b><u>&lt;true|false&gt;</u>
       <b>-finit-character=</b><u>n</u>
           The <b>-finit-local-zero</b> option instructs the  compiler  to  initialize  local  "INTEGER",  "REAL",  and
           "COMPLEX"  variables  to zero, "LOGICAL" variables to false, and "CHARACTER" variables to a string of
           null  bytes.   Finer-grained  initialization  options   are   provided   by   the   <b>-finit-integer=</b><u>n</u>,
           <b>-finit-real=</b><u>&lt;zero|inf|-inf|nan|snan&gt;</u>  (which  also  initializes the real and imaginary parts of local
           "COMPLEX" variables), <b>-finit-logical=</b><u>&lt;true|false&gt;</u>,  and  <b>-finit-character=</b><u>n</u>  (where  <u>n</u>  is  an  ASCII
           character value) options.

           With  <b>-finit-derived</b>,  components  of  derived  type variables will be initialized according to these
           flags.  Components whose type is not covered  by  an  explicit  <b>-finit-*</b>  flag  will  be  treated  as
           described above with <b>-finit-local-zero</b>.

           These options do not initialize

           *   objects with the POINTER attribute

           *   allocatable arrays

           *   variables that appear in an "EQUIVALENCE" statement.

           (These limitations may be removed in future releases).

           Note that the <b>-finit-real=nan</b> option initializes "REAL" and "COMPLEX" variables with a quiet NaN. For
           a  signalling  NaN  use  <b>-finit-real=snan</b>; note, however, that compile-time optimizations may convert
           them into quiet NaN and that trapping needs to be enabled (e.g. via <b>-ffpe-trap</b>).

           The <b>-finit-integer</b> option will parse the value into an integer of type  INTEGER(kind=C_LONG)  on  the
           host.   Said  value is then assigned to the integer variables in the Fortran code, which might result
           in wraparound if the value is too large for the kind.

           Finally, note that enabling any of the <b>-finit-*</b> options will silence warnings that  would  have  been
           emitted by <b>-Wuninitialized</b> for the affected local variables.

       <b>-falign-commons</b>
           By  default,  <b>gfortran</b> enforces proper alignment of all variables in a "COMMON" block by padding them
           as needed. On certain platforms this is mandatory, on others it increases performance. If a  "COMMON"
           block  is  not  declared  with  consistent data types everywhere, this padding can cause trouble, and
           <b>-fno-align-commons</b> can be used to disable automatic alignment. The same form of this option should be
           used for all files that share a "COMMON" block.  To avoid  potential  alignment  issues  in  "COMMON"
           blocks, it is recommended to order objects from largest to smallest.

       <b>-fno-protect-parens</b>
           By  default  the  parentheses  in  expression  are  honored for all optimization levels such that the
           compiler does not do any re-association. Using <b>-fno-protect-parens</b> allows  the  compiler  to  reorder
           "REAL"  and  "COMPLEX"  expressions  to  produce  faster  code.  Note  that  for  the  re-association
           optimization  <b>-fno-signed-zeros</b>  and  <b>-fno-trapping-math</b>  need  to  be  in  effect.  The  parentheses
           protection is enabled by default, unless <b>-Ofast</b> is given.

       <b>-frealloc-lhs</b>
           An  allocatable  left-hand  side  of  an intrinsic assignment is automatically (re)allocated if it is
           either unallocated or has a different shape. The option is enabled by default except when <b>-std=f95</b> is
           given. See also <b>-Wrealloc-lhs</b>.

       <b>-faggressive-function-elimination</b>
           Functions with identical argument lists are eliminated within statements, regardless of whether these
           functions are marked "PURE" or not. For example, in

                     a = f(b,c) + f(b,c)

           there will only be a single call to "f".  This option only works if <b>-ffrontend-optimize</b> is in effect.

       <b>-ffrontend-optimize</b>
           This option performs front-end optimization, based on manipulating  parts  the  Fortran  parse  tree.
           Enabled  by  default  by  any  <b>-O</b>  option  except  <b>-O0</b> and <b>-Og</b>.  Optimizations enabled by this option
           include:

           *&lt;inlining calls to "MATMUL",&gt;
           *&lt;elimination of identical function calls within expressions,&gt;
           *&lt;removing unnecessary calls to "TRIM" in comparisons and assignments,&gt;
           *&lt;replacing TRIM(a) with "a(1:LEN_TRIM(a))" and&gt;
           *&lt;short-circuiting of logical operators (".AND." and ".OR.").&gt;

           It can be deselected by specifying <b>-fno-frontend-optimize</b>.

       <b>-ffrontend-loop-interchange</b>
           Attempt to interchange loops in the Fortran front end where profitable.  Enabled by default by any <b>-O</b>
           option.  At the moment, this option only affects "FORALL" and "DO CONCURRENT" statements with several
           forall triplets.
