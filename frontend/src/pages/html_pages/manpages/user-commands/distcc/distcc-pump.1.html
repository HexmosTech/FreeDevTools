</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       distcc-pump - accelerate remote compilation with distcc

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>distcc-pump</b> <u>BUILD-COMMAND</u> <u>[ARGS]</u>  ...

       eval ` <b>distcc-pump</b> --startup `; <u>BUILD-COMMAND</u> <u>[ARGS]</u>  ...  ; <b>distcc-pump</b> --shutdown

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>distcc-pump</b> is part of distcc.  It is used for distcc's pump mode.  Distcc's pump mode accelerates remote
       compilation with distcc by also distributing preprocessing to the servers.

       For  a  detailed  description  of  pump mode, including most notably some <b>important</b> <b>restrictions,</b> see the
       <b><a href="../man1/distcc.1.html">distcc</a>(1)</b> man page, in particular the <b>HOW</b> <b>PUMP-MODE</b> <b>WORKS</b> section  and  the  <b>RESTRICTIONS</b>  <b>ON</b>  <b>PUMP</b>  <b>MODE</b>
       section.

       The simplest usage is the form
              <b>distcc-pump</b> <u>COMMAND</u> <u>[ARG]</u>  ...
       This will start an include server for distcc's "pump" mode; optionally run <b>lsdistcc</b> to compute the distcc
       host  list;  set  some  auxiliary environment variables; change PATH to use the distcc client in the same
       directory as the "distcc-pump" script; execute <u>COMMAND</u> with the specified <u>ARG(s)</u>  ; and  then  shut  down
       the include server.  The <u>COMMAND</u> is typically a parallel build command, such as "make -j80", that will do
       many concurrent invocations of distcc.

       An  alternative  way of invoking <b>distcc-pump</b> is to explicitly invoke "distcc-pump --startup" to start the
       include server and "distcc-pump --shutdown" to stop the  include  server.   The  "distcc-pump  --startup"
       command  will  start up the include server, and will print out some environment variable settings.  These
       environment variables are used to communicate between the  pump-mode  "distcc"  client  and  the  include
       server,  and  to communicate between "distcc-pump --startup" and "distcc-pump --shutdown".  The caller of
       "distcc-pump --startup" is responsible for setting those environment variables before  invoking  "distcc"
       or "distcc-pump --shutdown".

       For example:
              eval `distcc-pump --startup`
              make -j80
              distcc-pump --shutdown

       Note that distcc's pump-mode assumes that sources files will not be
        modified  during  the lifetime of the include server, so modifying source files during a build may cause
       inconsistent results.

</pre><h4><b>INVOKING</b> <b>LSDISTCC</b></h4><pre>
       When invoked in either the simple " <b>distcc-pump</b> <u>COMMAND</u> <u>[ARG]</u> ... " form, or as "  <b>distcc-pump</b>  <b>--startup</b>
       ",  the  <b>distcc-pump</b> script will invoke <b>lsdistcc</b>  whenever DISTCC_POTENTIAL_HOSTS is set and DISTCC_HOSTS
       isn't.  It will pass the value of DISTCC_POTENTIAL_HOSTS to <b>lsdistcc</b> and use the output  of  <b>lsdistcc</b>  to
       set DISTCC_HOSTS.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--help</b> Displays summary instructions.

       <b>--startup</b>
              Starts  an  include  server, and outputs the environment variable settings needed for <b><a href="../man1/distcc.1.html">distcc</a>(1)</b> or
              <b>distcc-pump</b> <b>--shutdown</b> to access it.

       <b>--shutdown</b>
              Shuts down an include server started up by <b>distcc-pump</b> <b>--startup.</b>

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables are all optional.

       <b>DISTCC_LOCATION</b>
              The location of the distcc bin directory,  which  is  normally  inferred  from  the  link-resolved
              dirname  of argv[0]. If this location is in fact the bin directory inside an installation (as will
              be the case when the pump script in the installation executes), then Python executables and distcc
              itself will be retrieved from the parent directory of the location.

       <b>DISTCC_MAX_DISCREPANCY</b>
              see the <b><a href="../man1/distcc.1.html">distcc</a>(1)</b> man page.

       <b>DISTCC_POTENTIAL_HOSTS</b>
              The distcc servers that will be queried by lsdistcc in order to produce a value for  DISTCC_HOSTS.
              This  value may be unset or null. In such cases, lsdistcc will not be invoked, and distcc will use
              DISTCC_HOSTS or the distcc hosts configuration file, as described  in  the  "Host  Specifications"
              section of <b><a href="../man1/distcc.1.html">distcc</a>(1).</b>

       <b>DISTCC_HOSTS</b>
              This variable is passed through to distcc but only if DISTCC_POTENTIAL_HOSTS is not set.

       <b>LSDISTCC_ARGS</b>
              Extra arguments to pass to lsdistcc.  See <b>lsdistcc</b> <b>--help</b> for more details.

       <b>INCLUDE_SERVER_ARGS</b>
              Extra arguments to pass to the include server.

       <b>PYTHONOPTIMIZE</b>
              If set to "", then Python optimization is disabled.
