</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       CVSps  is a program for generating 'patchset' information from a CVS repository.  A patchset in this case
       is defined as a set of changes made to a collection of files, and all committed at the same time (using a
       single 'cvs commit' command).  This information is valuable to seeing the big picture of the evolution of
       a cvs project.  While cvs tracks revision information, it is often difficult to  see  what  changes  were
       committed 'atomically' to the repository.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>     display usage summary

       <b>-x</b>     ignore (and rebuild) <a href="file:~/.cvsps/cvsps.cache">~/.cvsps/cvsps.cache</a> file

       <b>-u</b>     update <a href="file:~/.cvsps/cvsps.cache">~/.cvsps/cvsps.cache</a> file

       <b>-z</b> <b>&lt;fuzz&gt;</b>
              set the timestamp fuzz factor for identifying patch sets

       <b>-g</b>     generate diffs of the selected patch sets

       <b>-s</b> <b>&lt;patchset&gt;[-[&lt;patchset&gt;]][,&lt;patchset&gt;...]</b>
              generate a diff for a given patchsets and patchset ranges

       <b>-a</b> <b>&lt;author&gt;</b>
              restrict output to patchsets created by author

       <b>-f</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              restrict output to patchsets involving file

       <b>-d</b> <b>&lt;date1&gt;</b> <b>-d</b> <b>&lt;date2&gt;</b>
              if  just  one  date  specified,  show  revisions  newer  than date1.  If two dates specified, show
              revisions between two dates.

       <b>-l</b> <b>&lt;regex&gt;</b>
              restrict output to patchsets matching regex in log message

       <b>-b</b> <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b>
              restrict output to patchsets affecting history of branch.  If you want to  restrict  to  the  main
              branch, use a branch of 'HEAD'.

       <b>-r</b> <b>&lt;tag1&gt;</b> <b>-r</b> <b>&lt;tag2&gt;</b>
              if  just  one  tag  specified,  show  revisions  since tag1. If two tags specified, show revisions
              between the two tags.

       <b>-p</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
              output individual patchsets as files in &lt;dir&gt; as &lt;dir&gt;/&lt;patchset&gt;.patch

       <b>-v</b>     show very verbose parsing messages

       <b>-t</b>     show some brief memory usage statistics

       <b>--norc</b> when invoking cvs, ignore the .cvsrc file

       <b>--summary-first</b>
              when multiple patchset diffs are being generated, put the patchset summary for  all  patchsets  at
              the beginning of the output.

       <b>--test-log</b> <b>&lt;captured</b> <b>cvs</b> <b>log</b> <b>file&gt;</b>
              for  testing changes, you can capture cvs log output, then test against this captured file instead
              of hammering some poor CVS server

       <b>--bkcvs</b>
              (see note below) for use in parsing the BK-&gt;CVS tree log formats only.  This  enables  some  hacks
              which are not generally applicable.

       <b>--no-rlog</b>
              disable  the  use  of rlog internally.  Note: rlog is required for stable PatchSet numbering.  Use
              with care.

       <b>--diff-opts</b> <b>&lt;option</b> <b>string&gt;</b>
              send a custom set of options to diff, for example to increase the  number  of  context  lines,  or
              change the diff format.

       <b>--cvs-direct</b> <b>(--no-cvs-direct)</b>
              enable (disable) built-in cvs client code. This enables the 'pipelining' of multiple requests over
              a  single  client,  reducing  the  overhead  of handshaking and authentication to one per PatchSet
              instead of one per file.

       <b>--debuglvl</b> <b>&lt;bitmask&gt;</b>
              enable various debug output channels.

       <b>-Z</b> <b>&lt;compression&gt;</b>
              A value 1-9 which specifies amount of compression.  A value of 0 disables compression.

       <b>--root</b> <b>&lt;cvsroot&gt;</b>
              Override the setting of CVSROOT (overrides working dir. and environment).  For --cvs-direct only.

       <b>-q</b>     Be quiet about warnings.  <b>-A</b> Show ancestor branch when a new branch is found.

       <b>&lt;repository&gt;</b>
              Operate on the specified repository (overrides working dir.)

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b> <b>ON</b> <b>TAG</b> <b>HANDLING</b></h4><pre>
       Tags are fundamentally 'file at a time' in cvs, but like everything else, it would  be  nice  to  imagine
       that  they are 'repository at a time.'  The approach cvsps takes is that a tag is assigned to a patchset.
       The meaning of this is that after this patchset, every revision of every  file  is  after  the  tag  (and
       conversely,  before  this  patchset,  at least one file is still before the tag).  However, there are two
       kinds of inconsistent (or 'funky') tags that can be created, even when following best practices for cvs.

       The first is what is called a FUNKY tag.  A funky  tag  is  one  where  there  are  patchsets  which  are
       chronologically  (and  thus by patchset id) earlier than the tag, but are tagwise after.  These tags will
       be marked as '**FUNKY**' in the Tag: section of the cvsps output.  When a funky tag is specified  as  one
       of  the  '-r'  arguments, there are some number of patchsets which need to be considered out of sequence.
       In this case, the patchsets themselves will be labeled FUNKY and will be processed correctly.

       The second is called an INVALID tag.  An invalid tag is  a  tag  where  there  are  patchsets  which  are
       chronologically  (and thus by patchset id) earlier than the tag, but which have members which are tagwise
       both before, and after the tag, in the same patchset.  If an INVALID tag is specified as one of the  '-r'
       arguments,  cvsps  will  flag  each  member  of the affected patchsets as before or after the tag and the
       patchset summary will indicate which members are which, and diffs will be generated accordingly.

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b> <b>ON</b> <b>CVS</b> <b>VERSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Among the different cvs subcommands used by cvsps is the 'rlog' command.  The rlog command is used to get
       revision history of a module, and it disregards the current working directory.  The important  difference
       between  'rlog'  and  'log' (from cvsps perspective) is the 'rlog' will include log data for files not in
       the current working directory.  The impact of this is mainly when there are directories which at one time
       had files, but are now empty, and have been pruned from the working directory with the '-P'  option.   If
       'rlog' is not used, these files logs will not be parsed, and the PatchSet numbering will be unstable.

       The  main  problem  with  'rlog'  is  that,  until  cvs version 1.11.1, 'rlog' was an alias for the 'log'
       command.  This means, for old versions of cvs, 'rlog' has different  semantics  and  usage.   cvsps  will
       attempt to work around this problem by detecting capable versions of cvs.  If an old version is detected,
       'log' will be used instead of 'rlog', and YMMV.

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b> <b>ON</b> <b>GENERATED</b> <b>DIFFS</b></h4><pre>
       Another  important note is that cvsps will attempt, whenever possible, to use the r-commands (rlog, rdiff
       and co) instead of the local commands (log, diff, and update).   This  is  to  allow  cvsps  to  function
       without  a  completely  checked  out  tree.   Because these r-commands are used, the generated diffs will
       include the module directory in them, and it is recommended to apply them in the working  directory  with
       the  -p1  option  to  the patch command.  However, if the --diff-opts option is specified (to change, for
       example, the lines of context), then rdiff cannot be used, because it doesn't support arbitrary  options.
       In  this  case,  the  patches will be generated without the module directory in the path, and -p0 will be
       required when applying the patch.  When diffs are generated in cvs-direct mode (see below), however, they
       will always be -p1 style patches.

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b> <b>ON</b> <b>BKCVS</b></h4><pre>
       The --bkcvs option is a special operating mode that should only be used when parsing the log  files  from
       the  BK -&gt; CVS exported linux kernel trees.  cvsps uses special semantics for recreating the BK ChangeSet
       metadata that has been embedded in the log files for those trees.  The  --bkcvs  option  should  only  be
       specified  when  the cache file is being created or updated (i.e. initial run of cvsps, or when -u and -x
       options are used).

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b> <b>ON</b> <b>CVS-DIRECT</b></h4><pre>
       As of version 2.0b6 cvsps has a partial implementation of the cvs client code built in.  This reduces the
       RTT and/or handshaking overhead from one per patchset member to  one  per  patchset.   This  dramatically
       increases  the  speed  of  generating  diffs over a slow link, and improves the consistency of operation.
       Currently the --cvs-direct option turns on the use of this code, but it very well may be default  by  the
       time  2.0  comes  out.   The built-in cvs code attempts to be compatible with cvs, but may have problems,
       which should be reported.  It honors the CVS_RSH and CVS_SERVER environment variables, but does not parse
       the <a href="file:~/.cvsrc">~/.cvsrc</a> file.

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b> <b>ON</b> <b>CVSPS</b> <b>RC</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       CVSps parses an rc file at startup.  This file should be located in <a href="file:~/.cvsps/cvspsrc.">~/.cvsps/cvspsrc.</a>   The  file  should
       contain  arguments,  in  the  exact  syntax  as  the  command line, one per line.  If an argument takes a
       parameter, the parameter should be on the same line as the argument.

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b> <b>ON</b> <b>DATE</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       All dates are reported in localtime.  This  can  be  overridden  (as  usual)  using  the  TZ  environment
       variable.  Dates as arguments must be in the format 'yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss'; for example,

           $ cvsps -d '2004/05/01 00:00:00' -d '2004/07/07 12:00:00'
