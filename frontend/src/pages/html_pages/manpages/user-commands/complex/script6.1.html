       script6 - A tool to make complex IPv6 tasks easy <b>script6</b> SCRIPT <u>[PARAMETERS</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>script6</b> is a set up scripts that make frequent and/or rather complex IPv6-related tasks easy.

       <b>SCRIPTS</b>

       <b>get-aaaa</b>

       This script takes no further arguments, and operates as follows:

           + The tool reads domain names from standard-input (one per line),
             and obtains the AAAA records for the corresponding domain. If the
             domain name does not contain AAAA records, the tool will add
             the suffix "www.", in the hopes that the resulting domain name
             might contain some.

           + Lines where the first non-blank character is the numeral sign (#)
             are consdered to contain comments, and hence are ignored.

           + The format of the resulting output is:

             # DOMAIN_NAME (CANONIC_NAME)
             IPV6_ADDRESS_1
             IPV6_ADDRESS_2

       <b>get-alexa-domains</b>

       This script takes no further arguments, and operates as follows:

           + It reads from standard input lines with the same format as those
           of Alexa's Top 1M web sites. That is, lines with the folowing syntax:

           RANKING,DOMAIN_NAME

           + It extracts the domainname from each line, and prints the corresponding
           domain name to standard output.

       This script is typically useful for extracting domain names from Alexa's Top 1M web sites file, such that
       they can be processed by other tools (e.g. the get-aaaa command of script6).

       <b>get-ns</b>

       This script takes no further arguments, and operates as follows:

           + The tool reads domain names from standard-input (oner per line),
             and obtains the NS records for the corresponding domain.

           + Lines where the first non-blank character is the numeral sign (#)
             are consdered to contain comments, and hence are ignored.

           + The format of the resulting output is:

             # DOMAIN_NAME (CANONIC_NAME)
             MX_RECORD_1
             MX_RECORD_2

       <b>get-mx</b>

       This script takes no further arguments, and operates as follows:

           + The tool reads domain names from standard-input (oner per line),
             and obtains the MX for the corresponding domain.

           + Lines where the first non-blank character is the numeral sign (#)
             are consdered to contain comments, and hence are ignored.

           + The format of the resulting output is:

             # DOMAIN_NAME (CANONIC_NAME)
             MX_RECORD_1
             MX_RECORD_2

       <b>get-ns</b>

       This script takes no further arguments, and operates as follows:

           + The tool reads domain names from standard-input (oner per line),
             and obtains the NS records for the corresponding domain.

           + Lines where the first non-blank character is the numeral sign (#)
             are consdered to contain comments, and hence are ignored.

           + The format of the resulting output is:

             # DOMAIN_NAME (CANONIC_NAME)
             MX_RECORD_1
             MX_RECORD_2

       <b>get-trace-stats</b>

       This command causes the script6 tool to read from standard input the results of a "script6 trace" command
       (typically piped from a file), and produce statistics based on such results.

       Among the statistics produced by this command are:

          * Packet drop rate: That is, the percentage of destination IPv6
            addresses that result unreachable if IPv6 extension headers are
            employed.

          * Packet drop rate by different AS: That is, the percentage of packet
            drops that occur at an Autonomous System (AS) other than the AS
            corresponding to the destination IPv6 address.

          * Packet drop rate by same AS: That is, the percentage of packet
            drops that occur at the same Autonomous System (AS) as that
            corresponding to the destination IPv6 address.

          * Delta-Hops statistics: Statistics regarding the Delta-Hops at which
            the packet drops occur, with "delta-hops" defined as "the number of
            hops from the intended destination".

       The  get-trace-stats performs a number of sanity checks on the input data (i.e., the output from "script6
       trace"). For example, if a line of input indicates that the last responding node for  the  non-EH-enabled
       path6  command  is not the intended destination, this means that the destination is unreachable even when
       no IPv6 extension headers are employed, and hence the corresponding line will be discarded.

       <b>trace</b> <b>DESTINATION</b> <b>[EHTYPE[EHSIZE]]</b> <b>[PROTOCOL</b> <b>[DESTPORT]]]</b>

       The trace command causes the script6 to read IPv6 addresses from standard input (typically piped  from  a
       file).  For  each  IPv6 address, the script6 will try to isolate IPv6 blackholes resulting from employing
       IPv6 extension headers. By default, the probe  packets  (containing  IPv6  Extension  Headers)  are  IPv6
       packets  with  a  Destination  Options  Header  of 8 bytes, encapsulating an ICMPv6 Echo Request message.
       However, this can be overridden by specifying the  EHTYPE  {DO,HBH,FH},  EHSIZE  (an  integer),  PROTOCOL
       {tcp,udp,icmpv6}, and DESTPORT (a short integer) parameters.

       The  "trace" command of the script6 tool internally employs the path6 tool of the toolkit as follows. Let
       us assume that we want to  isolate  an  IPv6  blackhole  on  the  path  towards  the  destination  system
       2001:db8:d::1. Firstly, script6 will obtain the output of path6 towards such destination:

                 1. 2001:db8:1:1000::1
                 2. 2001:db8:2:2000::4
                 3. 2001:db8:2:4000::1
                 4. 2001:db8:3:4000::1
                 5. 2001:db8:3:1000::1
                 6. 2001:db8:4:4000::1
                 7. 2001:db8:4:1000::1
                 8. 2001:db8:5:5000::1
                 9. 2001:db8:5:6000::1
                 10. 2001:db8:d::1

       Subsequently, script6 will obtain the output of EH-enabled path6 to the same destination:

                 1. 2001:db8:1:1000::1
                 2. 2001:db8:2:2000::4
                 3. 2001:db8:2:4000::1
                 4. 2001:db8:3:4000::1
                 5. 2001:db8:3:1000::1
                 6. 2001:db8:4:4000::1

       For   the  sake  of  brevity,  let  us  refer  to  the  last-responding  node  in  the  EH-enabled  path6
       ("2001:db8:4:4000::1" in this case) as "M". Assuming both packets in both path6 commands employ the  same
       path,  we  will  refer  to  "the  node  following  the  last  responding  node  in  the EH-enabled path6"
       ("2001:db8:4:1000::1" in our case), as "M+1", etc.

       Based on traceroute information above, which node is the one actually  dropping  the  EH-enabled  packets
       will  depend  on  whether  the dropping node filters packets on ingress or the egress. If the former, the
       dropping node will be M+1.  If the latter, the dropping node will be  "M".

       path6 assumes that nodes perform ingress-filtering.  Thus, in our example above the last responding  node
       to  the  EH-enabled traceroute ("M") is "2001:db8:4:4000::1", and therefore we assume the "node" dropping
       node to be "2001:db8:4:1000::1" ("M+1").

       The resulting output will have the following syntax:

               DEST#LAST_NOEH#HOPS_NOEH#LAST_EH$HOPS_EH#DROPN#DROPN2

       where:

          * DEST: Destination IPv6 address (as read from standard input).
            In our example above, this would be 2001:db8:d::1.

          * LAST_NOEH: Last responding IPv6 address for the path6 command
            with no IPv6 extension headers (this will be the same as DEST
            if there is a working path to the destination). In our example
            above, this would be 2001:db8:d::1.

          * HOPS_NOEH: Number of hops to LAST_NOEH. In our example above,
            this would be "10".

          * LAST_EH: Last responding IPv6 address in the EH-enabled path6
            command. In our example above, this would be 2001:db8:4:4000::1.

          * HOPS_EH: Number of hops to LAST_EH. In our example above, this
            would be "6".

          * DROPN: Dropping node (M+1 in our explanation above). In our
            example above, this would be 2001:db8:4:1000::1.

          * DROPN: Node after the dropping node (M+2). In our example,
            this would be 2001:db8:5:5000::1.

       The output of the "trace" command is meant to be processed by the get-trace-stats command of the  script6
       tool. Please check the <a href="../man1/blackhole6.1.html">blackhole6</a>(1) tool for a more human-friendly tool for isolating IPv6 blackholes.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following sections illustrate typical use cases of the <b>script6</b> tool.

       <b>Example</b> <b>#1</b>

       $ script6 get-asn 2001:db8::1

       Obtain the Origin Autonomous System (AS) number for the IPv6 address 2001:db8::1.

       <b>Example</b> <b>#2</b>

       $ script6 get-as 2001:db8::1

       Obtain information about the Origin Autonomous System (AS) of the IPv6 address 2001:db8::1.

       <b>Example</b> <b>#3</b>

       $ cat domains.txt | script6 get-aaaa &gt; domains-aaaa.txt

       Map  the  domain names contained in the file "domains.txt" into AAAA records, and save the results in the
       file "domains-aaaa.txt".

       <b>Example</b> <b>#4</b>

       # cat domains-aaaa.txt | script6 trace do8 tcp port 25 &gt; trace-results.txt

       Find IPv6 blackholes in the path to each of the IPv6 addresses contained in the  file  "domains-aaaa.txt"
       (one  per  line),  and save the results to the file "trace-results.txt". The probe packets to be employed
       are IPv6 packets with a Destination Options header of 8 bytes,  encapsulating  a  TCP  segment  with  the
       Destinatio Port set to 25.

       <b>Example</b> <b>#5</b>

       $ cat trace-results.txt | script6 get-trace-stats

       Produce  statistics  based on the trace results from the file "trace-results.txt" (produced with "script6
       trace").
