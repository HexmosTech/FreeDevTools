</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Style</b>  analyses  the  surface  characteristics  of  the  writing  style of a document.  It prints various
       readability grades, length of words, sentences and paragraphs.  It  can  further  locate  sentences  with
       certain characteristics.  If no files are given, the document is read from standard input.

       Numbers  are  counted  as words with one syllable.  A sentence is a sequence of words, that starts with a
       capitalised word and ends with a full stop, double colon, question mark or exclamation  mark.   A  single
       letter  followed  by  a dot is considered an abbreviation, so it does not end a sentence.  Various multi-
       letter abbreviations are recognized, they do not end a sentence as well.  A paragraph consists of two  or
       more new line characters.

   <b>Readability</b> <b>grades</b>
       <b>Style</b> understands <u><a href="../man1/cpp.1.html">cpp</a></u>(1) <b>#line</b> lines for being able to give precise locations when printing sentences.

       Kincaid formula
              The Kincaid Formula was developed for U.S. Navy training manuals; it ranges in difficulty from 5.5
              to  16.3.   It  is  probably  best  applied  to  technical documents, because it is based on adult
              training manuals rather than school book text.  Dialogs  (often  found  in  fictional  texts)  are
              usually  a series of short sentences, which lowers the score.  On the other hand, scientific texts
              with many long scientific terms are rated higher, although they are not necessarily harder to read
              for people who are familiar with those terms.

              Kincaid = 11.8*syllables/wds+0.39*wds/sentences-15.59

       Automated Readability Index
              The Automated Readability Index is typically higher than Kincaid and Coleman-Liau, but lower  than
              Flesch.

              ARI = 4.71*chars/wds+0.5*wds/sentences-21.43

       Coleman-Liau Formula
              The  Coleman-Liau Formula usually gives a lower grade than Kincaid, ARI and Flesch when applied to
              technical documents.

              Coleman-Liau = 5.88*chars/wds-29.5*sent/wds-15.8

       Flesch Reading Ease formula
              Developed by Rudolph Flesch in 1948, the Flesch Reading Ease formula  is  based  on  school  texts
              covering  grades  3 to 12.  It is widespread, especially in the USA, because it is computed easily
              and produces good results.  The index ranges from  0  (hard)  to  100  (easy).   Standard  English
              documents  average around 60 to 70.  Applying it to German documents gives poor results because of
              the different language structure.

              Flesch Index = 206.835-84.6*syll/wds-1.015*wds/sent

       Fog Index
              The Fog index was developed by Robert Gunning.  Its value is a  school  grade.   The  “ideal”  Fog
              Index  level is 7 or 8.  A level above 12 indicates the writing sample is too hard for most people
              to read.  Texts less than 100 words will not produce meaningful  results.   Note  that  a  correct
              implementation  would  not  count  words  of  three  or  more  syllables  that  are  proper names,
              combinations of easy words, or made three syllables by suffixes such as –ed, –es, or –ing.

              Fog Index = 0.4*(wds/sent+100*((wds &gt;= 3 syll)/wds))

       Lix formula
              The Lix formula developed by Björnsson from Sweden is very simple and employs a mapping  table  as
              well:

              Lix = wds/sent+100*(wds &gt;= 6 char)/wds

              Index         34   38   41   44   48   51    54    57
              School year      5    6    7    8    9    10    11

       SMOG Grading
              The  SMOG  Grading  for English texts was developed by McLaughlin in 1969.  Its result is a school
              grade.

              SMOG Grading = square root of (((wds &gt;= 3 syll)/sent)*30) + 3

              It was adapted to German by Bamberger and Vanecek in 1984, who changed the constant +3 to -2.

   <b>Word</b> <b>usage</b>
       The word usage counts are intended to help identify excessive use of particular parts of speech.

       Verb Phrases
              The category of verbs labeled "to be" identifies phrases using the passive voice.  Use the passive
              voice sparingly, in favor of more direct verb forms.   The  flag  <b>-p</b>  causes  <b>style</b>  to  list  all
              occurrences of the passive voice.

       The  verb category "aux" measures the use of modal auxiliary verbs, such as "can", "could", and "should".
       Modal auxiliary verbs modify the mood of a verb.

       Conjunctions
              The conjunctions counted by style are coordinating and subordinating.   Coordinating  conjunctions
              join  grammatically  equal sentence fragments, such as a noun with a noun, a phrase with a phrase,
              or a clause to a clause.  Coordinating conjunctions are "and," "but," "or," "yet," and "nor."

       Subordinating conjunctions connect clauses of  unequal  status.   A  subordinating  conjunction  links  a
       subordinate  clause, which is unable to stand alone, to an independent clause.  Examples of subordinating
       conjunctions are "because," "although," and "even if."

       Pronouns
              Pronouns are contextual references to  nouns  and  noun  phrases.   Documents  with  few  pronouns
              generally lack cohesiveness and fluidity.  Too many pronouns may indicate ambiguity.

       Nominalizations
              Nominalizations  are  verbs that are changed to nouns.  Style recognizes words that end in "ment,"
              "ance," "ence,"  or  "ion"  as  nominalizations.   Examples  are  "endowment,"  "admittance,"  and
              "nominalization."   Too  much  nominalization in a document can sound abstract and be difficult to
              understand.  The flag <b>-N</b> causes <b>style</b> to  list  all  nominalizations.   The  flag  <b>-n</b>  prints  all
              sentences with either the passive voice or a nominalization.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       There was a style command on old UNIX systems, which is now part of the AT&amp;T DWB package.   The  original
       version was bound to roff by enforcing a call to deroff.
