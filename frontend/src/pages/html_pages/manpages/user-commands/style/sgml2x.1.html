</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sgml2x — Easily formats SGML/XML documents using DSSSL style-sheets

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sgml2x</b> [<u>options</u>]   [<u>sgmlfile</u>  | <u>xmlfile</u> ]

       <u>docclass</u>-2-<u>targetformat</u> [<u>options</u>]   [<u>sgmlfile</u>  | <u>xmlfile</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sgml2x</b>  allows  to  easily  format  a  SGML  or  XML  document using DSSSL style-sheets, and provides the
       following features:

          •  Multiple possible style-sheets per document class

          •  Easy specification of style-sheets using aliases, with support for parameter inheritance

          •  Easy integration of new style-sheets by adding a simple new  definition  file  in  a  configuration
             directory

          •  The  caller can specify a PATH-like list of configuration directories, defaulting to a system-wide,
             a per-user, and a per-project configuration directories

          •  Automatic selection of a default style-sheet to be used, based on assigned priorities

          •  Pass arbitrary options to <b><a href="../man1/jade.1.html">jade</a>(1)</b>

       The document-class used to look for the style-sheets, and the output format, is for now only derived from
       the name with which the program is called, so you will want to call this program through  symbolic  links
       like <b>docbook-2-pdf</b>.

       <b>sgml2x</b>  is  a implemented as a shell wrapper around <b><a href="../man1/jade.1.html">jade</a>(1)</b> (or, preferably, <b><a href="../man1/openjade.1.html">openjade</a>(1)</b>, although we use
       the generic name <b>jade</b> throughout this documentation), <b><a href="../man1/jadetex.1.html">jadetex</a>(1)</b> and other tools.

       If there is no <b>jadetex.cfg</b> file near the document, a default one is copied, that  enables  production  of
       PDF bookmarks.

</pre><h4><b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c</b>|<b>--catalog</b> <u>catalog</u>
                 Use the specified SGML catalog instead of the system default.

       <b>-C</b>|<b>--confdirs</b> <u>dir-list</u>
                 Use  (whitespace-separated) list of configuration directories.  This option is cumulative, i.e.
                 you can use several <b>-C</b> options and the lists will be concatenated.

       The list elements should be ordered from the most generic configuration (e.g. system-wide)  to  the  most
       specific (e.g. project-wide).

       If any directory is provided through this option, the default directory list will be ignored.

       <b>-D</b>|<b>--dssslproc</b> <u>dsssl-processor</u>
                 Use  <u>dsssl-processor</u>  to apply the style-sheet, instead of the default one.  This processor has
                 to support <b>jade</b>-like options, such as <b>-V</b>.

       When this option is not present, the first found in the <b>dssslproc</b> files  from  confdirs  is  taken.   See
       <u>"Files"</u>  for more details.

       <b>-h</b>|<b>--help</b> Display an help message and exit.

       <b>-j</b>|<b>--jade</b> <u>dsssl-processor</u>
                 Obsolete synonym for <b>--dssslproc</b>.

       <b>--jadetexfilter</b> <u>perl-filter</u>
                 Post-process the jadetex output using a perl filter.

       This  can  be  useful  to force pagebreaks at some specific places to overcome stylesheet problems, or to
       force hyphenations where TeX does not have enough patterns, or do any other clever  transformation  you'd
       think about.

       See the <b>examples/command-lines</b>       file for possible uses.

       <b>-n</b>|<b>--no-act</b>
                 Print  commands  instead  of  running  them.   Useful to learn about lower-level tools, and for
                 debugging the command-line.

       <b>-o</b>|<b>--openjade</b>
                 <u>This</u> <u>option</u> <u>is</u> <u>obsolete</u>.  <b>openjade</b> is now the default when available.   Use  <b>--dssslproc</b>  or  a
                 <b>dssslproc</b> configuration file to force a specific processor.

       This option used to use <b><a href="../man1/openjade.1.html">openjade</a>(1)</b>       as a DSSSL processor instead of <b><a href="../man1/jade.1.html">jade</a>(1)</b>.

       <b>-O</b>|<b>--jadeopts</b> <u>jade-options</u>
                 Additional  options  to pass to <b><a href="../man1/jade.1.html">jade</a>(1)</b>.  This option is cumulative, you can specify several of
                 them, the provided options will be concatenated.

       <b>-q</b>|<b>--quiet</b>
                 Set verbosity to <b>quiet</b>

       <b>-r</b>|<b>--remarks</b>
                 Render the content of document remarks in the document (<b>remark</b> elements in DocBook  4,  <b>comment</b>
                 elements  in  DocBook  3), making the produced output an <u>internal-use-only</u> <u>document</u>, printing a
                 bold warning on the cover.

       This is a docclass- and style-sheet-specific feature, and not all style-sheets will use this.

       <b>-s</b>|<b>--style</b> <u>style</u>
                 Select an output style to override the (eventually document-derived) default.

       Styles currently available for a specific document class and for each output format are dependent on  the
       contents of the configuration directories, and can be displayed with the <b>--help</b> option.

       Note  that  it is good practice to specify this option in a build procedure, so that you get reproducible
       results regardless of the available style-sheets.

       <b>-v</b>|<b>--verbose</b>
                 Increase verbosity.  This option can be specified multiple times.

       <b>--verbosity</b> <u>N</u>
                 Set verbosity to <u>N</u>.  The levels of verbosity are defined as follows:

                 <b>quiet</b>     Only print errors

                 <b>default</b>   Only print errors and warnings

                 <b>verbose</b>   Also print notices

                 <b>trace</b>     Also print significant commands as they are run (as <b>--no-act</b> does).

                 <b>debug</b>     Also print debugging messages

       <b>-V</b>|<b>--version</b>
                 Print the program version and exit.

</pre><h4><b>Configuration</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sgml2x</b> uses a configuration directory tree instead of a configuration file, so that it is easy for  other
       packages to plug in with a low risk of breaking an existing setup.

       Styles hierarchies are located in directories named <b>styles</b> in each configuration directory.  Old versions
       of this program used to put those hierarchies directly in the configuration directories.

       A  configuration  directory  contains  one directory for each known document class, named with a document
       class nickname (e.g. <b>docbook</b>).  Those docclass directories contain one sub-directory for  each  class  of
       output-format (currently, only <b>html</b> and <b>print</b> are supported).

       Currently, implementation issues enforce a limitation on nicknames for document classes and style-sheets:
       they can only contain alphanumeric and underscore characters.  This limitation may be dropped in a future
       release, but that's not going to happen before this script gets rewritten in another language.

       Each  of those directory contain one file per available style.  The names of these files may only contain
       alphanumeric characters, and are used as nicknames for the styles.  This file contains lines with a  <b>key:</b>
       <b>value</b> pattern, with the following keys being currently supported:

       <b>Id</b>        The public identifier for the style-sheet

       <b>Desc</b>      A short description of the styles, to be displayed in the help message

       <b>pdfOverride</b>, <b>psOverride</b>,
                 <b>rtfOverride</b>,  <b>mifOverride</b>"  10  A dsssl symbol from the print style-sheet to be set to <b>#t</b> (or a
                 <u>symbol</u>=<u>value</u> pair, suitable as argument to <b>jade</b>'s <b>-V</b>        option), to be used for  the  given
                 print format.

       Only one symbol per override line is allowed.  To define values for several symbols, use several lines.

       <b>Inherits</b>  The  nickname  of  a style-sheet this one inherits from, to avoid needless duplication of style
                 definitions.

       Currently, this only causes inheritance of the <b>*Override</b> parameters.

       <b>Priority</b>  An positive integer to help selecting the default style when one cannot  be  derived  from  the
                 document.   Higher  values get higher chance of being taken as default.  Take care of using low
                 priorities for hyper-specialized styles for a generic document-type, so that it  does  not  get
                 used by error.

       For  example,  the current recommended policy for the DocBook style-sheets derived from Norman Walsh's is
       as follows (and may change if experience proves it to be inadequate).

              10        The base style-sheets, which usually must be customized.

              0         Any style-sheet that was  written  for  an  hyper-specialized  purpose  (e.g.  marketing
                        product sheet).

              1000      A  default  style  for  all  documents  produced  by  an  organization.  Usually a light
                        customization, featuring layout preferences, the organization's logo, or such things.

              10-100    Miscellaneous generic customizations of the base style-sheets.

                        When you write an improved version of a style-sheet with priority <u>n</u>, you usually want to
                        select a higher priority.

</pre><h4><b>Files</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/etc/sgml/sgml2x/</b>

       <b><a href="file:~/.sgml2x/">~/.sgml2x/</a></b>

       <b>./sgml2x/</b> The default configuration directories, in which the configuration files are searched for.   See
                 documentation for <b>--confdirs</b> for more details.

       <u>confdir</u>/style/
                 The hierarchy that defines usable styles.  See <u>"Configuration"</u>  for more details.

       <u>confdir</u>/dssslproc
                 A file containing an ordered list of dsssl processors to look for, separated by newlines and/or
                 whitespace.   Lines starting with a <b>#</b> character are treated as comments.  Common values include
                 <b>openjade</b> and <b>jade</b>.

                 DSSSL processors specified here should  accept  the  <b>-V</b>  and  <b>-D</b>  jade-compatible  command-line
                 options.

                 The configuration directories are looked for starting with the most specific one, so that, with
                 the  default  confdirs,  the  project  settings  may  override user settings, which in turn may
                 override system settings.

                 The special value <b>false</b> can be used to stop the search and prevent looking  into  more  generic
                 directories.   If for example a project must use the <b>openjade-1.4devel</b> command and no other, it
                 can specify <b>openjade-1.4devel</b> <b>false</b> in its <b>dssslproc</b> file.

</pre><h4><b>Caveats</b></h4><pre>
       When using <b>openjade-1.4devel</b> as DSSSL processor, you'll see a complaint about the  top-level  flow-object
       generated  by  <b>doctype.dsl</b>,  and  automatic  determination of the document-type will fail.  This error is
       otherwise harmless.  Ideas of how to deal with  this,  or  confirmation  that  <b>openjade-1.4devel</b>  is  too
       strict, will be appreciated :)

</pre><h4><b>The</b> <b>future</b></h4><pre>
       Planned features for future releases include:

          •  Integration of an index generator

          •  Integration of a pretty-printing engine for code examples

          •  Specification of transformations to be chained

          •  Declaration  of subset docclasses to allow the use with any docclass of the style-sheets that apply
             to its superset docclasses.

          •  Work in a temporary location so as not to pollute the working directory with temporary files.  This
             is not as easy as it sounds, because it breaks a document refers  to  image  files  using  relative
             paths.  That may be seen as a jade bug, however.
