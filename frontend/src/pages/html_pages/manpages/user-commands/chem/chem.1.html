       chem - embed chemical structure diagrams in <u>groff</u> documents

</pre><h4><b>Synopsis</b></h4><pre>
       <b>chem</b> [<b>--</b>] [<u>file</u> ...]

       <b>chem</b> <b>-h</b>
       <b>chem</b> <b>--help</b>

       <b>chem</b> <b>-v</b>
       <b>chem</b> <b>--version</b>

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       <u>chem</u>  produces chemical structure diagrams.  Today's version is best suited for organic chemistry (bonds,
       rings).  The <u>chem</u> program is a <u>groff</u> preprocessor like <u>eqn</u>, <u>pic</u>, <u>tbl</u>, etc.  It generates <u>pic</u> output  such
       that all <u>chem</u> parts are translated into diagrams of the <u>pic</u> language.

       If no operands are given, or if <u>file</u> is “<b>-</b>”, <u>chem</u> reads the standard input stream.  <b>-h</b> and <b>--help</b> display
       a usage message, whereas <b>-v</b> and <b>--version</b> display version information; all exit.

       The  program  <u>chem</u>  originates  from the Perl source file <u>chem.pl</u>.  It tells <u>pic</u> to include a copy of the
       macro file <u>chem.pic</u>.  Moreover the <u>groff</u> source file <u>pic.tmac</u> is loaded.

       In a style reminiscent of <u>eqn</u> and <u>pic</u>, the <u>chem</u> diagrams are written in a special language.

       A set of <u>chem</u> lines looks like this

              .cstart
              <u>chem</u> <u>data</u>
              .cend

       Lines containing the keywords <b>.cstart</b> and <b>.cend</b> start and end the input for <u>chem</u>, respectively.   In  <u>pic</u>
       context,  i.e.,  after  the  call of <b>.PS</b>, <u>chem</u> input can optionally be started by the line <b>begin</b> <b>chem</b> and
       ended by the line with the single word <b>end</b> instead.

       Anything outside these initialization lines is copied through without modification; all data between  the
       initialization lines is converted into <u>pic</u> commands to draw the diagram.

       As an example,

              .cstart
              CH3
              bond
              CH3
              .cend

       prints two <b>CH3</b> groups with a bond between them.

       If  you  want to create just <u>groff</u> output, you must run <u>chem</u> followed by <u>groff</u> with the option <b>-p</b> for the
       activation of <u>pic</u>:

              <u>chem</u> [<u>file</u> ...] <b>|</b> <b>groff</b> <b>-p</b> ...

</pre><h4><b>Language</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>chem</u> input language is rather small.  It provides rings of several styles and  a  way  to  glue  them
       together as desired, bonds of several styles, moieties (e.g., <b>C</b>, <b>NH3</b>, ..., and strings.

   <b>Setting</b> <b>variables</b>
       There are some variables that can be set by commands.  Such commands have two possible forms, either

              <u>variable</u> <u>value</u>

       or

              <u>variable</u> <b>=</b> <u>value</u>

       This  sets  the given <u>variable</u> to the argument <u>value</u>.  If more arguments are given only the last argument
       is taken, all other arguments are ignored.

       There are only a few variables to be set by these commands:

       <b>textht</b> <u>arg</u>
              Set the height of the text to <u>arg</u>; default is 0.16.

       <b>cwid</b> <u>arg</u>
              Set the character width to <u>arg</u>; default is 0.12.

       <b>db</b> <u>arg</u> Set the bond length to <u>arg</u>; default is 0.2.

       <b>size</b> <u>arg</u>
              Scale the diagram to make it look plausible at point size <u>arg</u>; default is 10 point.

   <b>Bonds</b>
       This

              <b>bond</b> [<u>direction</u>] [<u>length</u> <u>n</u>] [<b>from</b> <u>Name</u>|<u>picstuff</u>]

       draws a single bond in direction from nearest corner of <u>Name</u>.  <b>bond</b> can also be <b>double</b> <b>bond</b>, <b>front</b>  <b>bond</b>,
       <b>back</b> <b>bond</b>, etc.  (We will get back to <u>Name</u> soon.)

       <u>direction</u>  is  the  angle  in  degrees  (0  up, positive clockwise) or a direction word like <b>up</b>, <b>down</b>, <b>sw</b>
       (= southwest), etc.  If no direction is specified, the bond goes in the current direction  (usually  that
       of the last bond).

       Normally  the  bond  begins  at the last object placed;  this can be changed by naming a <b>from</b> place.  For
       instance, to make a simple alkyl chain:
              <b>CH3</b>
              <b>bond</b>                (this one goes right from the CH3)
              <b>C</b>                   (at the right end of the bond)
              <b>double</b> <b>bond</b> <b>up</b>      (from the C)
              <b>O</b>                   (at the end of the double bond)
              <b>bond</b> <b>right</b> <b>from</b> <b>C</b>
              <b>CH3</b>

       A length in inches may be specified to override the default length.  Other <u>pic</u> commands can be tacked  on
       to the end of a bond command, to created dotted or dashed bonds or to specify a <b>to</b> place.

   <b>Rings</b>
       There  are  lots of rings, but only five- and six-sided rings get much support.  <b>ring</b> by itself is a six-
       sided ring; <b>benzene</b> is the benzene ring with a circle inside.  <b>aromatic</b> puts a circle into  any  kind  of
       ring.

              <b>ring</b> [<b>pointing</b> (<b>up</b>|<b>right</b>|<b>left</b>|<b>down</b>)] [<b>aromatic</b>] [<b>put</b> <b>Mol</b> <b>at</b> <u>n</u>] [<b>double</b> <u>i</u>,<u>j</u> <u>k</u>,<u>l</u> ... [<u>picstuff</u>]

       The  vertices  of  a  ring  are  numbered  1,  2,  ... from the vertex that points in the natural compass
       direction.  So for a hexagonal ring with the point at the top, the top vertex is 1, while if the ring has
       a point at the east side, that is vertex 1.  This is expressed as

              R1: ring pointing up
              R2: ring pointing right

       The ring vertices are named <b>.V1</b>, ..., <b>.V</b><u>n</u>, with <b>.V1</b> in the pointing direction.  So the corners of <b>R1</b>  are
       <b>R1.V1</b>  (the  <u>top</u>),  <b>R1.V2</b>, <b>R1.V3</b>, <b>R1.V4</b> (the <u>bottom</u>), etc., whereas for <b>R2</b>, <b>R2.V1</b> is the rightmost vertex
       and <b>R2.V4</b> the leftmost.  These vertex names are used for connecting bonds or other rings.  For example,

              R1: benzene pointing right
              R2: benzene pointing right with .V6 at R1.V2

       creates two benzene rings connected along a side.

       Interior double bonds are specified as <b>double</b> <u>n1</u><b>,</b><u>n2</u> <u>n3</u><b>,</b><u>n4</u> ...<b>;</b> each number pair adds  an  interior  bond.
       So the alternate form of a benzene ring is

              <b>ring</b> <b>double</b> <b>1,2</b> <b>3,4</b> <b>5,6</b>

       Heterocycles (rings with something other than carbon at a vertex) are written as <b>put</b> <u>X</u> <b>at</b> <u>V</u>, as in

              <b>R:</b> <b>ring</b> <b>put</b> <b>N</b> <b>at</b> <b>1</b> <b>put</b> <b>O</b> <b>at</b> <b>2</b>

       In this heterocycle, <b>R.N</b> and <b>R.O</b> become synonyms for <b>R.V1</b> and <b>R.V2</b>.

       There  are two five-sided rings.  <b>ring5</b> is pentagonal with a side that matches the six-sided ring; it has
       four natural directions.  A <b>flatring</b> is a five-sided ring created by chopping one corner of  a  six-sided
       ring so that it exactly matches the six-sided rings.

       The description of a ring has to fit on a single line.

   <b>Moieties</b> <b>and</b> <b>strings</b>
       A  moiety  is  a  string  of  characters  beginning with a capital letter, such as N(C2H5)2.  Numbers are
       converted to subscripts (unless they appear to be fractional values, as in N2.5H).  The name of a  moiety
       is  determined  from  the moiety after special characters have been stripped out: e.g., N(C2H5)2) has the
       name NC2H52.

       Moieties can be specified in two kinds.   Normally  a  moiety  is  placed  right  after  the  last  thing
       mentioned, separated by a semicolon surrounded by spaces, e.g.,

              <b>B1:</b> <b>bond</b> <b>;</b> <b>OH</b>

       Here the moiety is <b>OH</b>; it is set after a bond.

       As the second kind a moiety can be positioned as the first word in a <u>pic</u>-like command, e.g.,

              <b>CH3</b> <b>at</b> <b>C</b> <b>+</b> <b>(0.5,0.5)</b>

       Here  the moiety is <b>CH3</b>.  It is placed at a position relative to <b>C</b>, a moiety used earlier in the chemical
       structure.

       So moiety names can be specified as <u>chem</u> positions everywhere in the <u>chem</u> code.  Beneath  their  printing
       moieties are names for places.

       The  moiety  <b>BP</b>  is special.  It is not printed but just serves as a mark to be referred to in later <u>chem</u>
       commands.  For example,

              <b>bond</b> <b>;</b> <b>BP</b>

       sets a mark at the end of the bond.  This can be used then for  specifying  a  place.   The  name  <b>BP</b>  is
       derived from <u>branch</u> <u>point</u> (i.e., line crossing).

       A  string within double quotes <b>"</b> is interpreted as a part of a <u>chem</u> command.  It represents a string that
       should be printed (without the quotes).  Text within quotes <b>"</b>...<b>"</b> is treated more or less like  a  moiety
       except that no changes are made to the quoted part.

   <b>Names</b>
       In  the  alkyl chain above, notice that the carbon atom <b>C</b> was used both to draw something and as the name
       for a place.  A moiety always defines a name for a place;  you can use your own names for places instead,
       and indeed, for rings you will have to.  A name is just

              <u>Name</u><b>:</b> ...

       <u>Name</u> is often the name of a moiety like <b>CH3</b>, but it need not to be.  Any name that begins with a  capital
       letter and which contains only letters and numbers is valid:

              <b>First:</b> <b>bond</b>
                     <b>bond</b> <b>30</b> <b>from</b> <b>First</b>

   <b>Miscellaneous</b>
       The specific construction

              <b>bond</b> ... <b>;</b> <b>moiety</b>

       is equivalent to

              bond
              moiety

       Otherwise,  each  item  has  to  be  on  a  separate  line  (and only one line).  Note that there must be
       whitespace after the semicolon which separates the commands.

       A period character <b>.</b> or a single quote <b>'</b> in the first column of a line signals a <u>troff</u> command, which  is
       copied through as-is.

       A  line whose first non-blank character is a hash character (<b>#</b>) is treated as a comment and thus ignored.
       However, hash characters within a word are kept.

       A line whose first word is <b>pic</b> is copied through as-is after the word <b>pic</b> has been removed.

       The command

              <b>size</b> <u>n</u>

       scales the diagram to make it look plausible at point size <u>n</u> (default is 10 point).

       Anything else is assumed to be <u>pic</u> code, which is copied through with a label.

       Since <u>chem</u> is a <u>pic</u> preprocessor, it is possible to include <u>pic</u> statements in the middle of a diagram  to
       draw  things  not  provided  for  by <u>chem</u> itself.  Such <u>pic</u> statements should be included in <u>chem</u> code by
       adding <b>pic</b> as the first word of this line for clarity.

       The following <u>pic</u> commands are accepted as <u>chem</u> commands, so no <b>pic</b> command word is needed:

              <b>define</b> Start the definition of <u>pic</u> macro within <u>chem</u>.

              <b>[</b>      Start a block composite.

              <b>]</b>      End a block composite.

              <b>{</b>      Start a macro definition block.

              <b>}</b>      End a macro definition block.

       The macro names from <b>define</b> statements are stored and their call is accepted as a <u>chem</u> command as well.

   <b>Wish</b> <b>list</b>
       This TODO list was collected by Brian Kernighan.

       Error checking is minimal; errors are usually detected and reported in an oblique fashion by <u>pic</u>.

       There is no library or file inclusion mechanism, and there is no shorthand for repetitive structures.

       The extension mechanism is to create <u>pic</u> macros, but these are tricky to get right and don't have all the
       properties of built-in objects.

       There is no in-line chemistry yet (e.g., analogous to the <b>$</b>...<b>$</b> construct of <u>eqn</u>).

       There is no way to control entry point for bonds on groups.  Normally a bond connects to the carbon  atom
       if entering from the top or bottom and otherwise to the nearest corner.

       Bonds from substituted atoms on heterocycles do not join at the proper place without adding a bit of <u>pic</u>.

       There is no decent primitive for brackets.

       Text (quoted strings) doesn't work very well.

       A squiggle bond is needed.
