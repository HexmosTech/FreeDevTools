       rcs-checkin - accepts any number of file arguments and checks them into RCS

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rcs-checkin</b> <u>files</u> <u>...</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the <b>rcs-checkin</b>, command.  This manual page was written for the Debian
       GNU/Linux  distribution  because  the  original  program  does  not  have a manual page.  Instead, it has
       documentation in the GNU Info format; see below.

       The following is taken from the script itself.

       Arguments which are detectably either RCS masters (with names ending in ,v) or Emacs version files  (with
       names of the form foo.~&lt;number&gt;~) are ignored.  For each file foo, the script  looks  for  Emacs  version
       files  related  to  it.   These files are checked in as deltas, oldest first, so that the contents of the
       file itself becomes the latest revision in the master.

       The first line of each file is used as its description text.  The file itself is not deleted, as under VC
       with vc-keep-workfiles at its default of t, but all the version files are.

       If an argument file is already version-controlled under RCS, any version files are added to the  list  of
       deltas  and  deleted,  and then the workfile is checked in again as the latest version.  This is probably
       not quite what was wanted, and is the main reason VC doesn't simply call this to do checkins.

       This script is intended to be used to convert files with an old-Emacs-style version history for use  with
       VC  (the  Emacs 19 version-control interface), which likes to use RCS as its back end.  It was written by
       Paul Eggert and revised/documented for use with VC by Eric S. Raymond, Mar 19 1993.
