       DMitry - Deepmagic Information Gathering Tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dmitry</b> [Options] host

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       DMitry  (Deepmagic  Information  Gathering  Tool)  is a UNIX/(GNU)Linux command line application with the
       ability to gather as much information as possible about a host.

       Basic functionality of DMitry allows for information to be gathered about a target  host  from  a  simple
       whois lookup on the target to uptime reports and TCP portscans.

       The  application  is  considered  a  tool to assist in information gathering when information is required
       quickly by removing the need to enter multiple commands and the timely process of searching through  data
       from multiple sources.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options  should  be passed to DMitry in the form of '-option'.  Only options known by DMitry will be used
       and others will be ignored.  If options are not passed as a group block, the  trailing  options  will  be
       considered a host target.

       <b>-o</b> <b>filename</b>
              Create  an  ascii  text output of the results to the filename specified.  If no output filename is
              specified then output will be saved to "target.txt".  If this option is not specified in any  form
              output  will be sent to the standard output (STDOUT) by default.  This option MUST trail all other
              options, i.e. "dmitry -winseo target".

       <b>-i</b>     Perform an Internet Number whois lookup on the target IP address.

       <b>-w</b>     Perform a whois lookup on the host target.

       <b>-n</b>     Retrieve netcraft.com data concerning the host, this includes operating system, web server release
              and uptime information where available.

       <b>-s</b>     Perform a subdomain search on the specified target.  This  will  use  several  search  engines  to
              attempt  to  locate  subdomains  in the form of sub.target.  There is no set limit to the level of
              subdomain that can be located, however, there is a maximum string length of  40  characters  (NCOL
              40)  to limit memory usage.  Possible subdomains are then reversed to an IP address, if this comes
              back positive then the resulting subdomain is listed.  However, if the host uses  an  asterisk  in
              their DNS records all resolve subdomains will come back positive.

       <b>-e</b>     Perform  an  e-mail  address  search  on  the specified target.  This modules works using the same
              concept as the subdomain search by attempting to locate possible e-mail  addresses  for  a  target
              host.   The  e-mail  addresses  may also be for possible subdomains of the target host. There is a
              limit to the length of the e-mail address set to 50 characters (NCOL 50) to limit memory usage.

       <b>-p</b>     Perform a TCP portscan on the host target. This module will list open, closed and  filtered  ports
              within a specific range.

       <b>-f</b>     This  option will cause the TCP portscan module to report/display output of filtered ports.  These
              are usually ports  that  have  been  filtered  and/or  closed  by  a  firewall  at  the  specified
              host/target.   This  option  requires  that  the  '-p' option be passed as a previous option.  For
              example, "dmitry -pf target".

       <b>-b</b>     This option will cause the TCP portscan module  to  output  banners  if  they  are  received  when
              scanning  TCP  ports.   This  option requires that the '-p' option be passed as a previous option.
              For example, "dmitry -pb target".

       <b>-t</b>     This sets the Time To Live (TTL) of the portscan module when scanning individual ports.   This  is
              set  to  2  seconds by default.  This is usually required when scanning a host that has a firewall
              and/or has filtered ports which can slow down a scan.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       This section presents some example queries that can be made using dmitry.

       <b>dmitry</b> <b>-w</b> <b>mydomain.com</b>

       This will perform a named whois (INIC-WHOIS) lookup  on  the  target  host,  displaying  results  to  the
       standard output (STDOUT).

       <b>dmitry</b> <b>-winsepo</b> <b>sometextfile.txt</b> <b>mydomain.com</b>

       This  will  perform  all  the  basic  functions  on  the  target  host  and  store  all  the  output into
       "sometextfile.txt".

       <b>dmitry</b> <b>-winsepo</b> <b>mydomain.com</b>

       This will  perform  all  the  basic  functions  on  the  target  host  and  store  all  the  output  into
       "mydomain.txt".

       <b>dmitry</b> <b>-winsepfbo</b> <b>127.0.0.1</b>

       This  will  perform  all  the  basic  functions  on  the  target  host  and  store  all  the  output into
       "127.0.0.1.txt".  This will also display banners and show filtered ports.
