</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       podman-farm-build - Build images on farm nodes, then bundle them into a manifest list

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>podman</b> <b>farm</b> <b>build</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>context</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>podman</b>  <b>farm</b>  <b>build</b>  Builds an image on all nodes in a farm and bundles them up into a manifest list.  It
       executes the <b>podman</b> <b>build</b> command on the nodes in the farm with the given Containerfile. Once the  images
       are built on all the farm nodes, the images will be pushed to the registry given via the <b>--tag</b> flag. Once
       all  the  images  have been pushed, a manifest list will be created locally and pushed to the registry as
       well.

       The manifest list will contain an image per native architecture type that is present in the farm.

       The primary function of this command is to create multi-architecture builds  that  will  be  faster  than
       doing it via emulation using <b>podman</b> <b>build</b> <b>--arch</b> <b>--platform</b>.

       If  no farm is specified, the build will be sent out to all the nodes that <b>podman</b> <b>system</b> <b>connection</b> knows
       of.

       Note: Since the images built are directly pushed to a registry, the user must pass in a full  image  name
       using the <b>--tag</b> option in the format <u>registry</u><b>/</b><u>repository</u><b>/</b><u>imageName</u>[<b>:</b><u>tag</u>]`.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>--add-host=</b><u><b>hostname[;hostname[;...]]</b></u><b>:</b><u><b>ip</b></u>
       Add a custom host-to-IP mapping to the container's <b><a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a></b> file.

       The  option  takes  one  or  multiple semicolon-separated hostnames to be mapped to a single IPv4 or IPv6
       address, separated by a colon. It can also be used to overwrite the IP addresses of hostnames Podman adds
       to <b><a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a></b> by default (also see the <b>--name</b> and <b>--hostname</b>  options).  This  option  can  be  specified
       multiple  times  to  add  additional  mappings to <b><a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a></b>. It conflicts with the <b>--no-hosts</b> option and
       conflicts with <u>no_hosts=true</u> in <b>containers.conf</b>.

       Instead of an IP address, the special flag <u>host-gateway</u> can be given. This resolves to an IP address  the
       container  can  use  to  connect  to  the host. The IP address chosen depends on your network setup, thus
       there's no guarantee that Podman can determine the <u>host-gateway</u> address automatically,  which  will  then
       cause   Podman   to   fail  with  an  error  message.  You  can  overwrite  this  IP  address  using  the
       <u>host_containers_internal_ip</u> option in <u>containers.conf</u>.

       The <u>host-gateway</u> address is also used by Podman to automatically  add  the  <b>host.containers.internal</b>  and
       <b>host.docker.internal</b>  hostnames  to  <b><a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a></b>.   You  can  prevent that by either giving the <b>--no-hosts</b>
       option, or by setting <u>host_containers_internal_ip="none"</u> in <u>containers.conf</u>. If no  <u>host-gateway</u>  address
       was  configured manually and Podman fails to determine the IP address automatically, Podman will silently
       skip adding these internal hostnames to <b><a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a></b>. If Podman is  running  in  a  virtual  machine  using
       <b>podman</b>  <b>machine</b>  (this  includes  Mac  and  Windows hosts), Podman will silently skip adding the internal
       hostnames to <b><a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a></b>, unless an IP  address  was  configured  manually;  the  internal  hostnames  are
       resolved by the gvproxy DNS resolver instead.

       Podman will use the <b><a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a></b> file of the host as a basis by default, i.e.  any hostname present in this
       file  will  also  be  present  in  the  <b><a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a></b>  file  of  the container. A different base file can be
       configured using the <u>base_hosts_file</u> config in <b>containers.conf</b>.

   <b>--annotation=</b><u><b>annotation=value</b></u>
       Add an image <u>annotation</u> (e.g. annotation=<u>value</u>) to the image metadata. Can be used multiple times.

       Note: this information is not present in Docker image formats, so it is discarded when writing images  in
       Docker formats.

   <b>--authfile=</b><u><b>path</b></u>
       Path  of  the  authentication  file.  Default  is  <b>${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json</b>  on Linux, and
       <b>$HOME/.config/containers/auth.json</b> on Windows/macOS.  The  file  is  created  by  <b>podman</b>  <b>login</b>.  If  the
       authorization  state  is not found there, <b>$HOME/.docker/config.json</b> is checked, which is set using <b>docker</b>
       <b>login</b>.

       Note: There is also the option to override the default path of the authentication  file  by  setting  the
       <b>REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE</b> environment variable. This can be done with <b>export</b> <b>REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE=</b><u>path.</u>

   <b>--build-arg=</b><u><b>arg=value</b></u>
       Specifies  a  build  argument  and  its  value,  which  is  interpolated  in  instructions  read from the
       Containerfiles in the same way that environment variables are, but which are  not  added  to  environment
       variable list in the resulting image's configuration.

   <b>--build-arg-file=</b><u><b>path</b></u>
       Specifies  a  file containing lines of build arguments of the form <b>arg=value</b>.  The suggested file name is
       <b>argfile.conf</b>.

       Comment lines beginning with <b>#</b> are ignored, along with blank lines.  All others must be of the  <b>arg=value</b>
       format passed to <b>--build-arg</b>.

       If  several  arguments are provided via the <b>--build-arg-file</b> and <b>--build-arg</b> options, the build arguments
       are merged across all of the provided files and command line arguments.

       Any file provided in a <b>--build-arg-file</b> option is read before the arguments supplied via the  <b>--build-arg</b>
       option.

       When a given argument name is specified several times, the last instance is the one that is passed to the
       resulting builds. This means <b>--build-arg</b> values always override those in a <b>--build-arg-file</b>.

   <b>--build-context=</b><u><b>name=value</b></u>
       Specify an additional build context using its short name and its location.  Additional build contexts can
       be referenced in the same manner as we access different stages in COPY instruction.

       Valid values are:

              • Local  directory  –  e.g.  --build-context  project2=../path/to/project2/src (This option is not
                available with the remote Podman client. On Podman machine setup (i.e macOS  and  Windows)  path
                must exists on the machine VM)

              • HTTP URL to a tarball – e.g. --build-context src=https://example.org/releases/src.tar

              • Container   image   –   specified   with   a  container-image://  prefix,  e.g.  --build-context
                alpine=container-image://alpine:3.15, (also accepts docker://, docker-image://)

       On the Containerfile side, reference the build context on all commands that accept the “from”  parameter.
       Here’s how that might look:

       FROM [name]
       COPY --from=[name] ...
       RUN --mount=from=[name] …

       The value of [name] is matched with the following priority order:

              • Named build context defined with --build-context [name]=..

              • Stage defined with AS [name] inside Containerfile

              • Image [name], either local or in a remote registry

   <b>--cache-from=</b><u><b>image</b></u>
       Repository to utilize as a potential cache source. When specified, Buildah tries to look for cache images
       in  the  specified  repository  and attempts to pull cache images instead of actually executing the build
       steps locally. Buildah only attempts to pull previously cached images if they  are  considered  as  valid
       cache hits.

       Use the <b>--cache-to</b> option to populate a remote repository with cache content.

       Example

       # populate a cache and also consult it
       buildah build -t test --layers --cache-to registry/myrepo/cache --cache-from registry/myrepo/cache .

       Note: <b>--cache-from</b> option is ignored unless <b>--layers</b> is specified.

   <b>--cache-to=</b><u><b>image</b></u>
       Set this flag to specify a remote repository that is used to store cache images. Buildah attempts to push
       newly built cache image to the remote repository.

       Note: Use the <b>--cache-from</b> option in order to use cache content in a remote repository.

       Example

       # populate a cache and also consult it
       buildah build -t test --layers --cache-to registry/myrepo/cache --cache-from registry/myrepo/cache .

       Note: <b>--cache-to</b> option is ignored unless <b>--layers</b> is specified.

   <b>--cache-ttl</b>
       Limit  the  use  of cached images to only consider images with created timestamps less than <u>duration</u> ago.
       For example if <b>--cache-ttl=1h</b> is specified, Buildah considers intermediate cache images which are created
       under the duration of one hour, and intermediate cache images outside this duration is ignored.

       Note: Setting <b>--cache-ttl=0</b> manually is equivalent to using <b>--no-cache</b> in the implementation  since  this
       means that the user does not want to use cache at all.

   <b>--cap-add=</b><u><b>CAP_xxx</b></u>
       When  executing  RUN  instructions,  run  the  command  specified  in  the instruction with the specified
       capability added to its capability set.  Certain capabilities are granted by default; this option can  be
       used to add more.

   <b>--cap-drop=</b><u><b>CAP_xxx</b></u>
       When  executing  RUN  instructions,  run  the  command  specified  in  the instruction with the specified
       capability removed from its capability set.  The  CAP_CHOWN,  CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE,  CAP_FOWNER,  CAP_FSETID,
       CAP_KILL,  CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE,  CAP_SETFCAP,  CAP_SETGID,  CAP_SETPCAP, and CAP_SETUID capabilities are
       granted by default; this option can be used to remove them.

       If a capability is specified to both the <b>--cap-add</b> and <b>--cap-drop</b> options, it is dropped,  regardless  of
       the order in which the options were given.

   <b>--cert-dir=</b><u><b>path</b></u>
       Use   certificates   at   <u>path</u>   (*.crt,   *.cert,   *.key)   to   connect  to  the  registry.  (Default:
       /etc/containers/certs.d) For details, see <b><a href="../man5/containers-certs.d.5.html">containers-certs.d</a>(5)</b>.  (This option is not available with  the
       remote Podman client, including Mac and Windows (excluding WSL2) machines)

   <b>--cgroup-parent=</b><u><b>path</b></u>
       Path  to  cgroups  under  which the cgroup for the container is created. If the path is not absolute, the
       path is considered to be relative to the cgroups path of the init process. Cgroups are created if they do
       not already exist.

   <b>--cgroupns=</b><u><b>how</b></u>
       Sets the configuration for cgroup namespaces when handling <b>RUN</b> instructions.  The configured value can be
       "" (the empty string) or "private" to indicate that a new cgroup namespace  is  created,  or  it  can  be
       "host" to indicate that the cgroup namespace in which <b>buildah</b> itself is being run is reused.

   <b>--cleanup</b>
       Remove built images from farm nodes on success (Default: false).

   <b>--compat-volumes</b>
       Handle directories marked using the VOLUME instruction (both in this build, and those inherited from base
       images)  such  that their contents can only be modified by ADD and COPY instructions. Any changes made in
       those locations by RUN instructions will be reverted.  Before  the  introduction  of  this  option,  this
       behavior was the default, but it is now disabled by default.

   <b>--cpp-flag=</b><u><b>flags</b></u>
       Set  additional  flags to pass to the C Preprocessor <a href="../man1/cpp.1.html">cpp</a>(1). Containerfiles ending with a ".in" suffix is
       preprocessed via <a href="../man1/cpp.1.html">cpp</a>(1). This option can be used to pass additional flags to cpp.Note: You can  also  set
       default    CPPFLAGS    by    setting    the   BUILDAH_CPPFLAGS   environment   variable   (e.g.,   export
       BUILDAH_CPPFLAGS="-DDEBUG").

   <b>--cpu-period=</b><u><b>limit</b></u>
       Set the CPU period for the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS), which is a duration in microseconds. Once the
       container's CPU quota is used up, it will not be scheduled to run until the current period ends. Defaults
       to 100000 microseconds.

       On some systems, changing the resource limits may not be allowed for non-root users.  For  more  details,
       see         https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md#26-running-containers-with-
       resource-limits-fails-with-a-permissions-error

       This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.

   <b>--cpu-quota=</b><u><b>limit</b></u>
       Limit the CPU Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) quota.

       Limit the container's CPU usage. By default, containers run with the full CPU resource. The  limit  is  a
       number in microseconds. If a number is provided, the container is allowed to use that much CPU time until
       the CPU period ends (controllable via <b>--cpu-period</b>).

       On  some  systems,  changing the resource limits may not be allowed for non-root users. For more details,
       see         https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md#26-running-containers-with-
       resource-limits-fails-with-a-permissions-error

       This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.

   <b>--cpu-shares,</b> <b>-c=</b><u><b>shares</b></u>
       CPU shares (relative weight).

       By  default,  all  containers  get  the same proportion of CPU cycles. This proportion can be modified by
       changing the container's CPU share  weighting  relative  to  the  combined  weight  of  all  the  running
       containers.  Default weight is <b>1024</b>.

       The  proportion  only  applies when CPU-intensive processes are running.  When tasks in one container are
       idle, other containers can use the left-over CPU time. The actual amount of CPU time varies depending  on
       the number of containers running on the system.

       For  example,  consider  three  containers,  one  has a cpu-share of 1024 and two others have a cpu-share
       setting of 512. When processes in all three containers attempt to use 100% of CPU,  the  first  container
       receives  50%  of  the total CPU time. If a fourth container is added with a cpu-share of 1024, the first
       container only gets 33% of the CPU. The remaining containers receive 16.5%, 16.5% and 33% of the CPU.

       On a multi-core system, the shares of CPU time are distributed over all CPU cores. Even if a container is
       limited to less than 100% of CPU time, it can use 100% of each individual CPU core.

       For example, consider a system with more than three cores.  If the container <u>C0</u> is  started  with  <b>--cpu-</b>
       <b>shares=512</b>  running  one  process, and another container <u>C1</u> with <b>--cpu-shares=1024</b> running two processes,
       this can result in the following division of CPU shares:

       ┌─────┬───────────┬─────┬──────────────┐
       │ <b>PID</b> │ <b>container</b> │ <b>CPU</b> │ <b>CPU</b> <b>share</b>    │
       ├─────┼───────────┼─────┼──────────────┤
       │ 100 │ C0        │ 0   │ 100% of CPU0 │
       ├─────┼───────────┼─────┼──────────────┤
       │ 101 │ C1        │ 1   │ 100% of CPU1 │
       ├─────┼───────────┼─────┼──────────────┤
       │ 102 │ C1        │ 2   │ 100% of CPU2 │
       └─────┴───────────┴─────┴──────────────┘

       On some systems, changing the resource limits may not be allowed for non-root users.  For  more  details,
       see         https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md#26-running-containers-with-
       resource-limits-fails-with-a-permissions-error

       This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.

   <b>--cpuset-cpus=</b><u><b>number</b></u>
       CPUs in which to allow execution. Can be specified as a comma-separated list (e.g. <b>0,1</b>), as a range (e.g.
       <b>0-3</b>), or any combination thereof (e.g. <b>0-3,7,11-15</b>).

       On some systems, changing the resource limits may not be allowed for non-root users.  For  more  details,
       see         https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md#26-running-containers-with-
       resource-limits-fails-with-a-permissions-error

       This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.

   <b>--cpuset-mems=</b><u><b>nodes</b></u>
       Memory nodes (MEMs) in which to allow execution (0-3, 0,1). Only effective on NUMA systems.

       If there are four memory nodes on the system (0-3), use <b>--cpuset-mems=0,1</b> then processes in the container
       only uses memory from the first two memory nodes.

       On some systems, changing the resource limits may not be allowed for non-root users.  For  more  details,
       see         https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md#26-running-containers-with-
       resource-limits-fails-with-a-permissions-error

       This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.

   <b>--creds=</b><u><b>[username[:password]]</b></u>
       The [username[:password]] to use to authenticate with the registry, if required.  If one or  both  values
       are  not  supplied,  a  command line prompt appears and the value can be entered. The password is entered
       without echo.

       Note that the specified credentials are only used to authenticate against target  registries.   They  are
       not  used  for  mirrors  or  when  the  registry  gets  rewritten (see <b><a href="../man5/containers-registries.conf.5.html">containers-registries.conf</a>(5)</b>); to
       authenticate against those consider using a <b><a href="../man5/containers-auth.json.5.html">containers-auth.json</a>(5)</b> file.

   <b>--decryption-key=</b><u><b>key[:passphrase]</b></u>
       The [key[:passphrase]] to be used for decryption of images. Key can point to  keys  and/or  certificates.
       Decryption  is  tried with all keys. If the key is protected by a passphrase, it is required to be passed
       in the argument and omitted otherwise.

   <b>--device=</b><u><b>host-device[:container-device][:permissions]</b></u>
       Add a host device to the container.  Optional  <u>permissions</u>  parameter  can  be  used  to  specify  device
       permissions by combining <b>r</b> for read, <b>w</b> for write, and <b>m</b> for <b><a href="../man2/mknod.2.html">mknod</a></b>(2).

       Example: <b>--device=/dev/sdc:/dev/xvdc:rwm</b>.

       Note:  if  <u>host-device</u> is a symbolic link then it is resolved first.  The container only stores the major
       and minor numbers of the host device.

       Podman may load kernel modules required for using the specified device. The  devices  that  Podman  loads
       modules for when necessary are: /dev/fuse.

       In  rootless  mode,  the  new  device  is  bind mounted in the container from the host rather than Podman
       creating it within the container space. Because the bind mount  retains  its  SELinux  label  on  SELinux
       systems,  the  container  can  get  permission  denied  when accessing the mounted device. Modify SELinux
       settings to allow containers to use all device labels via the following command:

       $ sudo setsebool -P  container_use_devices=true

       Note: if the user only has access rights via a  group,  accessing  the  device  from  inside  a  rootless
       container  fails.  The  <b><a href="../man1/crun.1.html">crun</a>(1)</b>  runtime  offers  a workaround for this by adding the option <b>--annotation</b>
       <b>run.oci.keep_original_groups=1</b>.

   <b>--disable-compression,</b> <b>-D</b>
       Don't compress filesystem layers when building the image unless it is required by the location where  the
       image  is  being written.  This is the default setting, because image layers are compressed automatically
       when they are pushed to  registries,  and  images  being  written  to  local  storage  only  need  to  be
       decompressed  again  to  be  stored.   Compression  can  be  forced in all cases by specifying <b>--disable-</b>
       <b>compression=false</b>.

   <b>--dns=</b><u><b>ipaddr</b></u>
       Set custom DNS servers.

       This option can be used to override the DNS configuration passed to  the  container.  Typically  this  is
       necessary  when  the  host DNS configuration is invalid for the container (e.g., <b>127.0.0.1</b>). When this is
       the case the <b>--dns</b> flag is necessary for every run.

       The special value <b>none</b> can be specified to disable creation  of  <u><a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a></u>  in  the  container  by
       Podman.  The <u><a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a></u> file in the image is used without changes.

       This option cannot be combined with <b>--network</b> that is set to <b>none</b>.

       Note:  this  option  takes  effect  only  during  <u>RUN</u>  instructions  in  the  build.   It does not affect
       <u><a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a></u> in the final image.

   <b>--dns-option=</b><u><b>option</b></u>
       Set custom DNS options to be used during the build.

   <b>--dns-search=</b><u><b>domain</b></u>
       Set custom DNS search domains to be used during the build.

   <b>--env=</b><u><b>env[=value]</b></u>
       Add a value (e.g. env=<u>value</u>) to the built image.  Can be used multiple times.  If neither <b>=</b> nor  a  <u>value</u>
       are specified, but <u>env</u> is set in the current environment, the value from the current environment is added
       to the image.  To remove an environment variable from the built image, use the <b>--unsetenv</b> option.

   <b>--farm</b>
       This option specifies the name of the farm to be used in the build process.

       This option specifies the name of the farm to be used in the build process.

   <b>--file,</b> <b>-f=</b><u><b>Containerfile</b></u>
       Specifies  a  Containerfile which contains instructions for building the image, either a local file or an
       <b>http</b> or <b>https</b> URL.  If more than one Containerfile is specified, <u>FROM</u> instructions are only  be  accepted
       from the last specified file.

       If  a  build  context  is not specified, and at least one Containerfile is a local file, the directory in
       which it resides is used as the build context.

       Specifying the option <b>-f</b> <b>-</b> causes the Containerfile contents to be read from stdin.

   <b>--force-rm</b>
       Always remove intermediate containers after a build, even if the build fails (default true).

   <b>--format</b>
       Control the format for the built image's manifest and configuration data.  Recognized formats include <u>oci</u>
       (OCI image-spec v1.0, the default) and <u>docker</u> (version 2, using schema format 2 for the manifest).

       Note: You can also override the default  format  by  setting  the  BUILDAH_FORMAT  environment  variable.
       <b>export</b> <b>BUILDAH_FORMAT=docker</b>

   <b>--from</b>
       Overrides  the  first <b>FROM</b> instruction within the Containerfile.  If there are multiple FROM instructions
       in a Containerfile, only the first is changed.

       With the remote podman client,  not  all  container  transports  work  as  expected.  For  example,  oci-
       archive:/x.tar references /x.tar on the remote machine instead of on the client. When using podman remote
       clients it is best to restrict use to <u>containers-storage</u>, and <u>docker://</u> <u>transports</u>.

   <b>--group-add=</b><u><b>group</b></u> <b>|</b> <u><b>keep-groups</b></u>
       Assign additional groups to the primary user running within the container process.

              • <b>keep-groups</b> is a special flag that tells Podman to keep the supplementary group access.

       Allows  container  to  use  the  user's  supplementary  group access. If file systems or devices are only
       accessible by the rootless user's group, this flag tells the OCI runtime to pass the  group  access  into
       the  container. Currently only available with the <b>crun</b> OCI runtime. Note: <b>keep-groups</b> is exclusive, other
       groups cannot be specified with this flag. (Not available for remote commands, including Mac and  Windows
       (excluding WSL2) machines)

   <b>--help,</b> <b>-h</b>
       Print usage statement

   <b>--hooks-dir=</b><u><b>path</b></u>
       Each  *.json  file  in  the  path configures a hook for buildah build containers. For more details on the
       syntax of the JSON files and the semantics of hook injection. Buildah currently support  both  the  1.0.0
       and 0.1.0 hook schemas, although the 0.1.0 schema is deprecated.

       This option may be set multiple times; paths from later options have higher precedence.

       For the annotation conditions, buildah uses any annotations set in the generated OCI configuration.

       For  the  bind-mount  conditions,  only  mounts  explicitly  requested  by  the  caller  via --volume are
       considered. Bind mounts that buildah inserts by default (e.g. <a href="file:/dev/shm">/dev/shm</a>) are not considered.

       If --hooks-dir is unset for root callers, Buildah currently defaults to /usr/share/containers/oci/hooks.d
       and /etc/containers/oci/hooks.d in order of increasing precedence. Using these  defaults  is  deprecated.
       Migrate to explicitly setting --hooks-dir.

   <b>--http-proxy</b>
       By  default proxy environment variables are passed into the container if set for the Podman process. This
       can be disabled by setting the value to <b>false</b>.  The environment variables passed in  include  <b>http_proxy</b>,
       <b>https_proxy</b>,  <b>ftp_proxy</b>,  <b>no_proxy</b>, and also the upper case versions of those. This option is only needed
       when the host system must use a proxy but the  container  does  not  use  any  proxy.  Proxy  environment
       variables specified for the container in any other way overrides the values that have been passed through
       from  the  host.  (Other  ways to specify the proxy for the container include passing the values with the
       <b>--env</b> flag, or hard coding the proxy environment at container build time.)  When  used  with  the  remote
       client it uses the proxy environment variables that are set on the server process.

       Defaults to <b>true</b>.

   <b>--identity-label</b>
       Adds default identity label <b>io.buildah.version</b> if set. (default true).

   <b>--ignorefile</b>
       Path to an alternative .containerignore file.

   <b>--iidfile=</b><u><b>ImageIDfile</b></u>
       Write  the  built image's ID to the file.  When <b>--platform</b> is specified more than once, attempting to use
       this option triggers an error.

   <b>--ipc=</b><u><b>how</b></u>
       Sets the configuration for IPC namespaces when handling <b>RUN</b> instructions.  The configured value can be ""
       (the empty string) or "container" to indicate that a new IPC namespace is created, or it can be "host" to
       indicate that the IPC namespace in which <b>podman</b> itself is being run is reused, or it can be the  path  to
       an IPC namespace which is already in use by another process.

   <b>--isolation=</b><u><b>type</b></u>
       Controls  what  type  of isolation is used for running processes as part of <b>RUN</b> instructions.  Recognized
       types include <u>oci</u> (OCI-compatible runtime, the default), <u>rootless</u> (OCI-compatible runtime invoked using a
       modified configuration and its --rootless option enabled, with <u>--no-new-keyring</u> <u>--no-pivot</u> added  to  its
       <u>create</u>  invocation,  with network and UTS namespaces disabled, and IPC, PID, and user namespaces enabled;
       the default for unprivileged users), and <u>chroot</u> (an internal wrapper that  leans  more  toward  <a href="../man1/chroot.1.html">chroot</a>(1)
       than container technology).

       Note:  You  can  also  override  the  default isolation type by setting the BUILDAH_ISOLATION environment
       variable.  <b>export</b> <b>BUILDAH_ISOLATION=oci</b>

   <b>--jobs=</b><u><b>number</b></u>
       Run up to N concurrent stages in parallel.  If the number of jobs is greater than 1, stdin is  read  from
       /dev/null.  If 0 is specified, then there is no limit in the number of jobs that run in parallel.

   <b>--label=</b><u><b>label</b></u>
       Add an image <u>label</u> (e.g. label=<u>value</u>) to the image metadata. Can be used multiple times.

       Users can set a special LABEL <b>io.containers.capabilities=CAP1,CAP2,CAP3</b> in a Containerfile that specifies
       the  list  of  Linux  capabilities  required for the container to run properly. This label specified in a
       container image tells Podman to run the container with  just  these  capabilities.  Podman  launches  the
       container  with  just the specified capabilities, as long as this list of capabilities is a subset of the
       default list.

       If the specified capabilities are not in the default set, Podman prints an error  message  and  runs  the
       container with the default capabilities.

   <b>--layer-label=</b><u><b>label[=value]</b></u>
       Add  an  intermediate  image  <u>label</u> (e.g. label=<u>value</u>) to the intermediate image metadata. It can be used
       multiple times.

       If <u>label</u> is named, but neither <b>=</b> nor a <b>value</b> is provided, then the <u>label</u> is set to an empty value.

   <b>--layers</b>
       Cache intermediate images during the build process (Default is <b>true</b>).

       Note: You can also override the default  value  of  layers  by  setting  the  BUILDAH_LAYERS  environment
       variable. <b>export</b> <b>BUILDAH_LAYERS=true</b>

   <b>--local,</b> <b>-l</b>
       Build image on local machine as well as on farm nodes.

   <b>--logfile=</b><u><b>filename</b></u>
       Log  output  which  is  sent  to  standard  output and standard error to the specified file instead of to
       standard output and standard error.  This option is not supported on the remote client, including Mac and
       Windows (excluding WSL2) machines.

   <b>--memory,</b> <b>-m=</b><u><b>number[unit]</b></u>
       Memory limit. A <u>unit</u> can be <b>b</b> (bytes), <b>k</b> (kibibytes), <b>m</b> (mebibytes), or <b>g</b> (gibibytes).

       Allows the memory available to a container to be constrained. If the host supports swap memory, then  the
       <b>-m</b>  memory  setting  can  be  larger  than physical RAM. If a limit of 0 is specified (not using <b>-m</b>), the
       container's memory is not limited. The actual limit may be rounded up to  a  multiple  of  the  operating
       system's page size (the value is very large, that's millions of trillions).

       This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.

   <b>--memory-swap=</b><u><b>number[unit]</b></u>
       A  limit  value  equal  to memory plus swap.  A <u>unit</u> can be <b>b</b> (bytes), <b>k</b> (kibibytes), <b>m</b> (mebibytes), or <b>g</b>
       (gibibytes).

       Must be used with the <b>-m</b> (<b>--memory</b>) flag.  The argument value must be larger than that of
        <b>-m</b> (<b>--memory</b>) By default, it is set to double the value of <b>--memory</b>.

       Set <u>number</u> to <b>-1</b> to enable unlimited swap.

       This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.

   <b>--network=</b><u><b>mode</b></u><b>,</b> <b>--net</b>
       Sets the configuration for network namespaces when handling <b>RUN</b> instructions.

       Valid <u>mode</u> values are:

              • <b>none</b>: no networking.

              • <b>host</b>: use the Podman host network stack. Note: the host mode gives the container full access  to
                local system services such as D-bus and is therefore considered insecure.

              • <b>ns:</b><u>path</u>: path to a network namespace to join.

              • <b>private</b>: create a new namespace for the container (default)

              • <b>&lt;network</b>  <b>name|ID&gt;</b>: Join the network with the given name or ID, e.g. use <b>--network</b> <b>mynet</b> to join
                the network with the name mynet. Only supported for rootful users.

              • <b>slirp4netns[:OPTIONS,...]</b>: use <b><a href="../man1/slirp4netns.1.html">slirp4netns</a></b>(1) to create a user network stack. It is possible  to
                specify   these   additional   options,  they  can  also  be  set  with  <b>network_cmd_options</b>  in
                containers.conf:

                • <b>allow_host_loopback=true|false</b>: Allow slirp4netns to reach the host loopback  IP  (default  is
                  10.0.2.2  or  the  second  IP  from  slirp4netns cidr subnet when changed, see the cidr option
                  below). The default is false.

                • <b>mtu=MTU</b>: Specify the MTU to use for this network. (Default is <b>65520</b>).

                • <b>cidr=CIDR</b>: Specify ip range to use for this network. (Default is <b>10.0.2.0/24</b>).

                • <b>enable_ipv6=true|false</b>: Enable IPv6. Default is true. (Required for <b>outbound_addr6</b>).

                • <b>outbound_addr=INTERFACE</b>: Specify the outbound interface slirp binds to (ipv4 traffic only).

                • <b>outbound_addr=IPv4</b>: Specify the outbound ipv4 address slirp binds to.

                • <b>outbound_addr6=INTERFACE</b>: Specify the outbound interface slirp binds to (ipv6 traffic only).

                • <b>outbound_addr6=IPv6</b>: Specify the outbound ipv6 address slirp binds to.

              • <b>pasta[:OPTIONS,...]</b>: use <b><a href="../man1/pasta.1.html">pasta</a></b>(1) to create a user-mode networking stack.
                This is the default for rootless containers and only supported in rootless mode.
                By default, IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and routes, as well as the pod interface  name,  are  copied
                from  the host. If port forwarding isn't configured, ports are forwarded dynamically as services
                are bound on either side (init namespace or container namespace). Port forwarding preserves  the
                original  source  IP  address. Options described in <a href="../man1/pasta.1.html">pasta</a>(1) can be specified as comma-separated
                arguments.
                In terms of <a href="../man1/pasta.1.html">pasta</a>(1) options, <b>--config-net</b> is given by default, in order to configure networking
                when the container is started, and <b>--no-map-gw</b> is also  assumed  by  default,  to  avoid  direct
                access from container to host using the gateway address. The latter can be overridden by passing
                <b>--map-gw</b> in the pasta-specific options (despite not being an actual <a href="../man1/pasta.1.html">pasta</a>(1) option).
                Also,  <b>-t</b> <b>none</b> and <b>-u</b> <b>none</b> are passed to disable automatic port forwarding based on bound ports.
                Similarly, <b>-T</b> <b>none</b> and <b>-U</b> <b>none</b> are given to disable the same  functionality  from  container  to
                host.
                Some examples:

                • <b>pasta:--map-gw</b>: Allow the container to directly reach the host using the gateway address.

                • <b>pasta:--mtu,1500</b>: Specify a 1500 bytes MTU for the <u>tap</u> interface in the container.

                • <b>pasta:--ipv4-only,-a,10.0.2.0,-n,24,-g,10.0.2.2,--dns-forward,10.0.2.3,-m,1500,--no-ndp,--no-</b>
                  <b>dhcpv6,--no-dhcp</b>,   equivalent   to  default  <a href="../man1/slirp4netns.1.html">slirp4netns</a>(1)  options:  disable  IPv6,  assign
                  <b>10.0.2.0/24</b> to the <b>tap0</b>  interface  in  the  container,  with  gateway  <b>10.0.2.3</b>,  enable  DNS
                  forwarder reachable at <b>10.0.2.3</b>, set MTU to 1500 bytes, disable NDP, DHCPv6 and DHCP support.

                • <b>pasta:-I,tap0,--ipv4-only,-a,10.0.2.0,-n,24,-g,10.0.2.2,--dns-forward,10.0.2.3,--no-ndp,--no-</b>
                  <b>dhcpv6,--no-dhcp</b>,  equivalent to default <a href="../man1/slirp4netns.1.html">slirp4netns</a>(1) options with Podman overrides: same as
                  above, but leave the MTU to 65520 bytes

                • <b>pasta:-t,auto,-u,auto,-T,auto,-U,auto</b>: enable automatic  port  forwarding  based  on  observed
                  bound ports from both host and container sides

                • <b>pasta:-T,5201</b>:  enable  forwarding of TCP port 5201 from container to host, using the loopback
                  interface instead of the tap interface for improved performance

   <b>--no-cache</b>
       Do not use existing cached images for the container build. Build from the start with a new set of  cached
       layers.

   <b>--no-hostname</b>
       Do not create the <u><a href="file:/etc/hostname">/etc/hostname</a></u> file in the containers.

       By  default,  Podman manages the <u><a href="file:/etc/hostname">/etc/hostname</a></u> file, adding the container's own hostname.  When the <b>--no-</b>
       <b>hostname</b> option is set, the image's <u><a href="file:/etc/hostname">/etc/hostname</a></u> will be preserved unmodified if it exists.

   <b>--no-hosts</b>
       Do not modify the <b><a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a></b> file in the container.

       Podman assumes control over the  container's  <b><a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a></b>  file  by  default  and  adds  entries  for  the
       container's   name   (see   <b>--name</b>   option)   and   hostname   (see  <b>--hostname</b>  option),  the  internal
       <b>host.containers.internal</b> and <b>host.docker.internal</b> hosts, as well as any hostname added using  the  <b>--add-</b>
       <b>host</b>  option.  Refer  to the <b>--add-host</b> option for details. Passing <b>--no-hosts</b> disables this, so that the
       image's <b><a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a></b> file is kept unmodified. The same can be achieved globally by setting <u>no_hosts=true</u> in
       <b>containers.conf</b>.

       This option conflicts with <b>--add-host</b>.

   <b>--omit-history</b>
       Omit build history information in the built image. (default false).

       This option is useful for the cases where end users explicitly want to set  <b>--omit-history</b>  to  omit  the
       optional  <b>History</b>  from  built  images  or  when  working with images built using build tools that do not
       include <b>History</b> information in their images.

   <b>--os-feature=</b><u><b>feature</b></u>
       Set the name of a required operating system <u>feature</u> for the image which is built.   By  default,  if  the
       image  is  not  based  on  <u>scratch</u>,  the base image's required OS feature list is kept, if the base image
       specified any.  This option is typically only meaningful when the image's OS is Windows.

       If <u>feature</u> has a trailing <b>-</b>, then the <u>feature</u> is removed from the  set  of  required  features  which  is
       listed in the image.

   <b>--os-version=</b><u><b>version</b></u>
       Set  the  exact required operating system <u>version</u> for the image which is built.  By default, if the image
       is not based on <u>scratch</u>, the base image's required OS version is kept, if the base image  specified  one.
       This  option is typically only meaningful when the image's OS is Windows, and is typically set in Windows
       base images, so using this option is usually unnecessary.

   <b>--pid=</b><u><b>pid</b></u>
       Sets the configuration for PID namespaces when handling <b>RUN</b> instructions.  The configured value can be ""
       (the empty string) or "container" to indicate that a new PID namespace is created, or it can be "host" to
       indicate that the PID namespace in which <b>podman</b> itself is being run is reused, or it can be the path to a
       PID namespace which is already in use by another process.

   <b>--platforms=</b><u><b>p1,p2,p3...</b></u>
       Build only on farm nodes that match the given platforms.

   <b>--pull=</b><u><b>policy</b></u>
       Pull image policy. The default is <b>missing</b>.

              • <b>always</b>: Always pull the image and throw an error if the pull fails.

              • <b>missing</b>: Only pull the image when it does not exist in the local containers storage.   Throw  an
                error if no image is found and the pull fails.

              • <b>never</b>:  Never  pull the image but use the one from the local containers storage.  Throw an error
                when no image is found.

              • <b>newer</b>: Pull if the image on the registry is newer than the one in the local containers  storage.
                An image is considered to be newer when the digests are different.  Comparing the time stamps is
                prone to errors.  Pull errors are suppressed if a local image was found.

   <b>--quiet,</b> <b>-q</b>
       Suppress  output  messages  which  indicate  which  instruction  is being processed, and of progress when
       pulling images from a registry, and when writing the output image.

   <b>--retry=</b><u><b>attempts</b></u>
       Number of times to retry pulling or pushing images between the registry and  local  storage  in  case  of
       failure. Default is <b>3</b>.

   <b>--retry-delay=</b><u><b>duration</b></u>
       Duration  of  delay  between retry attempts when pulling or pushing images between the registry and local
       storage in case of failure. The default is to start at two seconds and then exponentially back  off.  The
       delay is used when this value is set, and no exponential back off occurs.

   <b>--rm</b>
       Remove intermediate containers after a successful build (default true).

   <b>--runtime=</b><u><b>path</b></u>
       The  <u>path</u>  to  an  alternate  OCI-compatible  runtime, which is used to run commands specified by the <b>RUN</b>
       instruction.

       Note: You can also override the default runtime by  setting  the  BUILDAH_RUNTIME  environment  variable.
       <b>export</b> <b>BUILDAH_RUNTIME=/usr/local/bin/runc</b>

   <b>--runtime-flag=</b><u><b>flag</b></u>
       Adds  global flags for the container runtime. To list the supported flags, please consult the manpages of
       the selected container runtime.

       Note: Do not pass the leading -- to the flag. To pass the runc flag --log-format json to  buildah  build,
       the option given is --runtime-flag log-format=json.

   <b>--sbom=</b><u><b>preset</b></u>
       Generate  SBOMs  (Software Bills Of Materials) for the output image by scanning the working container and
       build contexts using the named combination of scanner image, scanner commands, and merge strategy.   Must
       be  specified  with  one  or  more  of  <b>--sbom-image-output</b>, <b>--sbom-image-purl-output</b>, <b>--sbom-output</b>, and
       <b>--sbom-purl-output</b>.  Recognized presets, and the set of options which they equate to:

   <b>--sbom-scanner-command=</b><u><b>image</b></u>
       Generate SBOMs by running the specified command  from  the  scanner  image.   If  multiple  commands  are
       specified,  they  are  run  in  the  order  in  which  they  are specified.  These text substitutions are

             The root of the built image's filesystem, bind mounted.
         - {CONTEXT}
             The build context and additional build contexts, bind mounted.

             The name of a temporary output file, to be read and merged with others or copied elsewhere.

   <b>--sbom-scanner-image=</b><u><b>image</b></u>
       Generate SBOMs using the specified scanner image.

   <b>--secret=id=id[,src=</b><u><b>envOrFile</b></u><b>][,env=</b><u><b>ENV</b></u><b>][,type=</b><u><b>file</b></u> <b>|</b> <u><b>env</b></u><b>]</b>
       Pass secret information to be used in the Containerfile for building images in a safe way that  will  not
       end  up stored in the final image, or be seen in other stages.  The value of the secret will be read from
       an environment variable or file named by the "id"  option,  or  named  by  the  "src"  option  if  it  is
       specified,  or from an environment variable specified by the "env" option. See EXAMPLES ⟨#examples⟩.  The
       secret will be mounted in the container at <b>/run/secrets/id</b> by default.

       To later use the secret, use the --mount flag in a <b>RUN</b> instruction within a <b>Containerfile</b>:

       <b>RUN</b> <b>--mount=type=secret,id=mysecret</b> <b>cat</b> <b>/run/secrets/mysecret</b>

       The location of the secret in the container can be overridden using the "target", "dst", or "destination"
       option of the <b>RUN</b> <b>--mount</b> flag.

       <b>RUN</b> <b>--mount=type=secret,id=mysecret,target=/run/secrets/myothersecret</b> <b>cat</b> <b>/run/secrets/myothersecret</b>

       Note: changing the contents of secret files will not trigger a rebuild of layers that use said secrets.

   <b>--security-opt=</b><u><b>option</b></u>
       Security Options

              • <b>apparmor=unconfined</b> : Turn off apparmor confinement for the container

              • <b>apparmor=alternate-profile</b> : Set the apparmor confinement profile for the container

              • <b>label=user:USER</b>     : Set the label user for the container processes

              • <b>label=role:ROLE</b>     : Set the label role for the container processes

              • <b>seccomp=profile.json</b> :  JSON file to be used as the seccomp filter for the container.

   <b>--shm-size=</b><u><b>number[unit]</b></u>
       Size of <u><a href="file:/dev/shm">/dev/shm</a></u>. A <u>unit</u> can be <b>b</b> (bytes), <b>k</b> (kibibytes), <b>m</b> (mebibytes), or <b>g</b> (gibibytes).  If  the  unit
       is  omitted, the system uses bytes. If the size is omitted, the default is <b>64m</b>.  When <u>size</u> is <b>0</b>, there is
       no limit on the amount of memory used for IPC by the container.  This option conflicts with <b>--ipc=host</b>.

   <b>--skip-unused-stages</b>
       Skip stages in multi-stage builds which don't affect the target stage. (Default: <b>true</b>).

   <b>--squash</b>
       Squash all of the image's new layers into a single new layer; any preexisting layers are not squashed.

   <b>--squash-all</b>
       Squash all of the new image's layers (including those inherited from a base  image)  into  a  single  new
       layer.

   <b>--ssh=</b><u><b>default</b></u> <b>|</b> <u><b>id[=socket&gt;</b></u>
       SSH  agent  socket or keys to expose to the build.  The socket path can be left empty to use the value of
       <b>default=$SSH_AUTH_SOCK</b>

       To later use the ssh agent, use the --mount option in a <b>RUN</b> instruction within a <b>Containerfile</b>:

       <b>RUN</b> <b>--mount=type=ssh,id=id</b> <b>mycmd</b>

   <b>--tag,</b> <b>-t=</b><u><b>imageName</b></u>
       Specifies the name which is assigned to the resulting image if the build process completes  successfully.
       If  <u>imageName</u>  does  not  include  a registry name, the registry name <u>localhost</u> is prepended to the image
       name.

   <b>--target=</b><u><b>stageName</b></u>
       Set the target build stage to build.  When building a Containerfile with multiple build stages,  --target
       can  be  used  to specify an intermediate build stage by name as the final stage for the resulting image.
       Commands after the target stage is skipped.

   <b>--timestamp=</b><u><b>seconds</b></u>
       Set the create timestamp to seconds since epoch to allow for deterministic builds  (defaults  to  current
       time).  By  default,  the  created  timestamp  is  changed and written into the image manifest with every
       commit, causing the image's sha256 hash to be  different  even  if  the  sources  are  exactly  the  same
       otherwise.   When  --timestamp  is  set,  the  created  timestamp is always set to the time specified and
       therefore not changed, allowing the image's sha256 hash to remain the same. All files  committed  to  the
       layers of the image is created with the timestamp.

       If the only instruction in a Containerfile is <b>FROM</b>, this flag has no effect.

   <b>--tls-verify</b>
       Require  HTTPS  and verify certificates when contacting registries (default: <b>true</b>).  If explicitly set to
       <b>true</b>, TLS verification is used.  If set to <b>false</b>, TLS verification is not used.  If  not  specified,  TLS
       verification  is  used  unless  the  target  registry  is  listed  as an insecure registry in <b><a href="../man5/containersregistries.conf.5.html">containers-</a></b>
       <b><a href="../man5/containersregistries.conf.5.html">registries.conf</a>(5)</b>

   <b>--ulimit=</b><u><b>type=soft-limit[:hard-limit]</b></u>
       Specifies resource limits to apply to processes launched when processing <b>RUN</b>  instructions.  This  option
       can be specified multiple times.  Recognized resource types include:
         "core": maximum core dump size (ulimit -c)

         "sigpending": maximum number of pending signals (ulimit -i)
         "stack": maximum stack size (ulimit -s)

   <b>--unsetenv=</b><u><b>env</b></u>
       Unset environment variables from the final image.

   <b>--unsetlabel=</b><u><b>label</b></u>
       Unset the image label, causing the label not to be inherited from the base image.

   <b>--userns=</b><u><b>how</b></u>
       Sets  the  configuration for user namespaces when handling <b>RUN</b> instructions.  The configured value can be
       "" (the empty string) or "container" to indicate that a new user namespace is created, it can  be  "host"
       to  indicate that the user namespace in which <b>podman</b> itself is being run is reused, or it can be the path
       to a user namespace which is already in use by another process.

   <b>--userns-gid-map=</b><u><b>mapping</b></u>
       Directly specifies a GID mapping to be used to set ownership, at the filesystem  level,  on  the  working
       container's  contents.   Commands  run  when handling <b>RUN</b> instructions defaults to being run in their own
       user namespaces, configured using the UID and GID maps.

       Entries in this map take the form of one or more triples of a starting in-container GID, a  corresponding
       starting host-level GID, and the number of consecutive IDs which the map entry represents.

       This option overrides the <u>remap-gids</u> setting in the <u>options</u> section of /etc/containers/storage.conf.

       If  this  option  is  not specified, but a global --userns-gid-map setting is supplied, settings from the
       global option is used.

       If  none  of  --userns-uid-map-user,  --userns-gid-map-group,  or  --userns-gid-map  are  specified,  but
       --userns-uid-map is specified, the GID map is set to use the same numeric values as the UID map.

   <b>--userns-gid-map-group=</b><u><b>group</b></u>
       Specifies  that  a  GID  mapping  to  be  used  to set ownership, at the filesystem level, on the working
       container's contents, can be found in entries in the <b><a href="file:/etc/subgid">/etc/subgid</a></b> file which correspond to  the  specified
       group.   Commands  run when handling <b>RUN</b> instructions defaults to being run in their own user namespaces,
       configured using the UID and GID maps.  If --userns-uid-map-user is specified, but --userns-gid-map-group
       is not specified, <b>podman</b> assumes that the specified user name is also a suitable group name to use as the
       default setting for this option.

       <b>NOTE:</b> When this option is specified by a rootless user,  the  specified  mappings  are  relative  to  the
       rootless  user  namespace  in  the  container,  rather  than being relative to the host as it is when run
       rootful.

   <b>--userns-uid-map=</b><u><b>mapping</b></u>
       Directly specifies a UID mapping to be used to set ownership, at the filesystem  level,  on  the  working
       container's contents.  Commands run when handling <b>RUN</b> instructions default to being run in their own user
       namespaces, configured using the UID and GID maps.

       Entries  in this map take the form of one or more triples of a starting in-container UID, a corresponding
       starting host-level UID, and the number of consecutive IDs which the map entry represents.

       This option overrides the <u>remap-uids</u> setting in the <u>options</u> section of /etc/containers/storage.conf.

       If this option is not specified, but a global --userns-uid-map setting is  supplied,  settings  from  the
       global option is used.

       If  none  of  --userns-uid-map-user,  --userns-gid-map-group,  or  --userns-uid-map  are  specified,  but
       --userns-gid-map is specified, the UID map is set to use the same numeric values as the GID map.

   <b>--userns-uid-map-user=</b><u><b>user</b></u>
       Specifies that a UID mapping to be used to set  ownership,  at  the  filesystem  level,  on  the  working
       container's  contents,  can be found in entries in the <b><a href="file:/etc/subuid">/etc/subuid</a></b> file which correspond to the specified
       user.  Commands run when handling <b>RUN</b> instructions defaults to being run in their  own  user  namespaces,
       configured using the UID and GID maps.  If --userns-gid-map-group is specified, but --userns-uid-map-user
       is not specified, <b>podman</b> assumes that the specified group name is also a suitable user name to use as the
       default setting for this option.

       <b>NOTE:</b>  When  this  option  is  specified  by  a rootless user, the specified mappings are relative to the
       rootless user namespace in the container, rather than being relative to  the  host  as  it  is  when  run
       rootful.

   <b>--uts=</b><u><b>how</b></u>
       Sets the configuration for UTS namespaces when handling <b>RUN</b> instructions.  The configured value can be ""
       (the empty string) or "container" to indicate that a new UTS namespace to be created, or it can be "host"
       to  indicate  that the UTS namespace in which <b>podman</b> itself is being run is reused, or it can be the path
       to a UTS namespace which is already in use by another process.

   <b>--volume,</b> <b>-v=</b><u><b>[HOST-DIR:CONTAINER-DIR[:OPTIONS]]</b></u>
       Mount a host directory into containers when executing RUN instructions during the build.

       The <b>OPTIONS</b> are a comma-separated list and can be one or more of:

              • [rw|ro]

              • [z|Z|O]

              • [U]

              • [<b>[r]shared</b>|<b>[r]slave</b>|<b>[r]private</b>][1] ⟨#Footnote1⟩

       The <b>CONTAINER-DIR</b> must be an absolute path such as <b>/src/docs</b>. The <b>HOST-DIR</b> must be an  absolute  path  as
       well. Podman bind-mounts the <b>HOST-DIR</b> to the specified path when processing RUN instructions.

       You can specify multiple  <b>-v</b> options to mount one or more mounts.

       You  can add the <b>:ro</b> or <b>:rw</b> suffix to a volume to mount it read-only or read-write mode, respectively. By
       default, the volumes are mounted read-write.  See examples.

       <b>Chowning</b> <b>Volume</b> <b>Mounts</b>

       By default, Podman does not change the owner and group of source volume directories mounted. When running
       using user namespaces, the UID and GID inside the namespace may correspond to another UID and GID on  the
       host.

       The  <b>:U</b>  suffix  tells  Podman  to  use  the correct host UID and GID based on the UID and GID within the
       namespace, to change recursively the owner and group of the source volume.

       <b>Warning</b> use with caution since this modifies the host filesystem.

       <b>Labeling</b> <b>Volume</b> <b>Mounts</b>

       Labeling systems like SELinux require that proper labels are placed on  volume  content  mounted  into  a
       container.  Without a label, the security system might prevent the processes running inside the container
       from using the content. By default, Podman does not change the labels set by the OS.

       To change a label in the container context, add one of these two suffixes <b>:z</b> or <b>:Z</b> to the  volume  mount.
       These  suffixes tell Podman to relabel file objects on the shared volumes. The <b>z</b> option tells Podman that
       two containers share the volume content. As a result, Podman labels the content  with  a  shared  content
       label.  Shared  volume  labels  allow all containers to read/write content.  The <b>Z</b> option tells Podman to
       label the content with a private unshared label.  Only the current container can use a private volume.

       Note: Do not relabel system files and directories. Relabeling system content might cause  other  confined
       services  on  the  host  machine to fail.  For these types of containers, disabling SELinux separation is
       recommended.  The option <b>--security-opt</b> <b>label=disable</b> disables SELinux separation for the container.  For
       example, if a user wanted to volume mount their entire home directory into  the  build  containers,  they
       need to disable SELinux separation.

       $ podman build --security-opt label=disable -v $HOME:/home/user .

       <b>Overlay</b> <b>Volume</b> <b>Mounts</b>

       The  <b>:O</b>  flag  tells Podman to mount the directory from the host as a temporary storage using the Overlay
       file system. The <b>RUN</b> command containers are allowed to modify contents  within  the  mountpoint  and  are
       stored in the container storage in a separate directory.  In Overlay FS terms the source directory is the
       lower,  and  the container storage directory is the upper. Modifications to the mount point are destroyed
       when the <b>RUN</b> command finishes executing, similar to a tmpfs mount point.

       Any subsequent execution of <b>RUN</b> commands sees the original source directory  content,  any  changes  from
       previous RUN commands no longer exists.

       One  use case of the <b>overlay</b> mount is sharing the package cache from the host into the container to allow
       speeding up builds.

       Note:

              • Overlay mounts are not currently supported in rootless mode.

              • The <b>O</b> flag is not allowed to be specified with the <b>Z</b> or  <b>z</b>  flags.   Content  mounted  into  the
                container is labeled with the private label.  On SELinux systems, labels in the source directory
                needs  to  be  readable  by  the  container  label. If not, SELinux container separation must be
                disabled for the container to work.

              • Modification of the directory volume mounted into the container with an overlay mount can  cause
                unexpected failures. Do not modify the directory until the container finishes running.

       By  default  bind  mounted  volumes  are <b>private</b>. That means any mounts done inside containers are not be
       visible on the host and vice versa. This behavior can be changed by specifying a volume mount propagation
       property.

       When the mount propagation policy is set to <b>shared</b>, any mounts completed inside  the  container  on  that
       volume  is visible to both the host and container. When the mount propagation policy is set to <b>slave</b>, one
       way mount propagation is enabled and any mounts completed on the host for that  volume  is  visible  only
       inside  of  the  container.  To  control  the  mount  propagation  property of volume use the <b>:[r]shared</b>,
       <b>:[r]slave</b> or <b>:[r]private</b> propagation flag. For mount propagation to work on the source mount point (mount
       point where source dir is mounted on) has to have the right propagation properties.  For shared  volumes,
       the  source mount point has to be shared. And for slave volumes, the source mount has to be either shared
       or slave. [1] ⟨#Footnote1⟩

       Use <b>df</b> <b>&lt;source-dir&gt;</b> to determine the source mount and then use  <b>findmnt</b>  <b>-o</b>  <b>TARGET,PROPAGATION</b>  <b>&lt;source-</b>
       <b>mount-dir&gt;</b>  to determine propagation properties of source mount, if <b>findmnt</b> utility is not available, the
       source mount point can be determined by looking at the  mount  entry  in  <b><a href="file:/proc/self/mountinfo">/proc/self/mountinfo</a></b>.  Look  at
       <b>optional</b> <b>fields</b> and see if any propagation properties are specified.  <b>shared:X</b> means the mount is <b>shared</b>,
       <b>master:X</b>  means  the  mount  is  <b>slave</b>  and  if  nothing  is  there  that means the mount is <b>private</b>. [1]
       ⟨#Footnote1⟩

       To change propagation properties of a mount point use the <b>mount</b> command. For example, to bind  mount  the
       source  directory  <b>/foo</b>  do  <b>mount</b>  <b>--bind</b>  <b>/foo</b>  <b>/foo</b>  and <b>mount</b> <b>--make-private</b> <b>--make-shared</b> <b>/foo</b>. This
       converts /foo into a <b>shared</b> mount point.  The propagation properties of the source mount can  be  changed
       directly.  For  instance  if  <b>/</b> is the source mount for <b>/foo</b>, then use <b>mount</b> <b>--make-shared</b> <b>/</b> to convert <b>/</b>
       into a <b>shared</b> mount.

</pre><h4><b>FOOTNOTES</b></h4><pre>
       1: The Podman project is committed to inclusivity, a core value of open  source.  The  <b>master</b>  and  <b>slave</b>
       mount  propagation  terminology used here is problematic and divisive, and needs to be changed.  However,
       these terms are currently used within the Linux kernel and must be used as-is  at  this  time.  When  the
       kernel maintainers rectify this usage, Podman will follow suit immediately.

                                                                                            <u><a href="../man1/podman-farm-build.1.html">podman-farm-build</a></u>(1)
