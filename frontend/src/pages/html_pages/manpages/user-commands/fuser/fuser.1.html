       fuser - identify processes using files or sockets

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fuser</b> [<b>-fuv</b>] [<b>-a</b>|<b>-s</b>] [<b>-4</b>|<b>-6</b>] [<b>-c</b>|<b>-m</b>|<b>-n</b> <u>space</u>] [ <b>-k</b> [<b>-i</b>] [<b>-M</b>] [<b>-w</b>] [<b>-</b><u>SIGNAL</u>] ] <u>name</u> ...
       <b>fuser</b> <b>-l</b>
       <b>fuser</b> <b>-V</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fuser</b>  displays  the PIDs of processes using the specified files or file systems.  In the default display
       mode, each file name is followed by a letter denoting the type of access:

              <b>c</b>      current directory.
              <b>e</b>      executable being run.
              <b>f</b>      open file.  <b>f</b> is omitted in default display mode.
              <b>F</b>      open file for writing.  <b>F</b> is omitted in default display mode.
              <b>r</b>      root directory.
              <b>m</b>      mmap'ed file or shared library.
              <b>.</b>      Placeholder, omitted in default display mode.

       <b>fuser</b> returns a non-zero return code if none of the specified files is accessed or in  case  of  a  fatal
       error.  If at least one access has been found, <b>fuser</b> returns zero.

       In  order to look up processes using TCP and UDP sockets, the corresponding name space has to be selected
       with the <b>-n</b> option. By default <b>fuser</b> will look in both IPv6 and IPv4  sockets.   To  change  the  default
       behavior,  use  the  <b>-4</b> and <b>-6</b> options.  The socket(s) can be specified by the local and remote port, and
       the remote address.  All fields are optional, but commas in front of missing fields must be present:

       [<u>lcl_port</u>][,[<u>rmt_host</u>][,[<u>rmt_port</u>]]]

       Either symbolic or numeric values can be used for IP addresses and port numbers.

       <b>fuser</b> outputs only the PIDs to stdout, everything else is sent to stderr.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b>, <b>--all</b>
              Show all files specified on the command line.  By default, only files  that  are  accessed  by  at
              least one process are shown.

       <b>-c</b>     Same as <b>-m</b> option, used for POSIX compatibility.

       <b>-f</b>     Silently ignored, used for POSIX compatibility.

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--kill</b>
              Kill  processes  accessing  the  file.   Unless  changed  with <b>-</b><u>SIGNAL</u>, SIGKILL is sent.  An <b>fuser</b>
              process never kills itself, but may kill other <b>fuser</b> processes.  The  effective  user  ID  of  the
              process executing <b>fuser</b> is set to its real user ID before attempting to kill.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--interactive</b>
              Ask  the user for confirmation before killing a process.  This option is silently ignored if <b>-k</b> is
              not present too.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--inode</b>
              For the name space <b>file</b> let all comparisons be based on the inodes of the  specified  file(s)  and
              never on the file names even on network based file systems.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--list-signals</b>
              List all known signal names.

       <b>-m</b> <u>NAME</u>, <b>--mount</b> <u>NAME</u>
              <u>NAME</u>  specifies  a file on a mounted file system or a block device that is mounted.  All processes
              accessing files on that file system are listed.  If a directory is specified, it is  automatically
              changed to <u>NAME</u>/ to use any file system that might be mounted on that directory.

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--ismountpoint</b>
              Request  will  be  fulfilled only if <u>NAME</u> specifies a mountpoint.  This is an invaluable seat belt
              which prevents you from killing the machine if <u>NAME</u> happens to not be a filesystem.

       <b>-w</b>     Kill only processes which have write access.  This option is silently ignored if <b>-k</b> is not present
              too.

       <b>-n</b> <u>NAMESPACE</u>, <b>--namespace</b> <u>NAMESPACE</u>
              Select a different name space.  The name spaces <b>file</b> (file names, the  default),  <b>udp</b>  (local  UDP
              ports),  and  <b>tcp</b>  (local  TCP  ports)  are  supported.   For ports, either the port number or the
              symbolic name can be specified.  If there is no ambiguity, the shortcut notation <u>name</u><b>/</b><u>space</u> (e.g.,
              <u>80</u><b>/</b><u>tcp</u>) can be used.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--silent</b>
              Silent operation.  <b>-u</b> and <b>-v</b> are ignored in this mode.  <b>-a</b> must not be used with <b>-s</b>.

       <b>-</b><u>SIGNAL</u>
              Use the specified signal instead of SIGKILL when killing  processes.   Signals  can  be  specified
              either  by  name  (e.g., <b>-HUP</b>) or by number (e.g., <b>-1</b>).  This option is silently ignored if the <b>-k</b>
              option is not used.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--user</b>
              Append the user name of the process owner to each PID.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Verbose mode.  Processes are shown in a <b>ps</b>-like style.  The  fields  PID,  USER  and  COMMAND  are
              similar  to <b>ps</b>.  ACCESS shows how the process accesses the file.  Verbose mode will also show when
              a particular file is being accessed as a mount point, knfs export or  swap  file.   In  this  case
              <b>kernel</b> is shown instead of the PID.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Display version information.

       <b>-4</b>, <b>--ipv4</b>
              Search  only  for  IPv4  sockets.  This option must not be used with the <b>-6</b> option and only has an
              effect with the tcp and udp namespaces.

       <b>-6</b>, <b>--ipv6</b>
              Search only for IPv6 sockets.  This option must not be used with the <b>-4</b> option  and  only  has  an
              effect with the tcp and udp namespaces.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a>  location of the proc file system

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fuser</b> <b>-km</b> <b><a href="file:/home">/home</a></b>
              kills all processes accessing the file system <a href="file:/home">/home</a> in any way.

       <b>if</b> <b>fuser</b> <b>-s</b> <b>/dev/ttyS1;</b> <b>then</b> <b>:;</b> <b>else</b> <u>command</u><b>;</b> <b>fi</b>
              invokes <u>command</u> if no other process is using /dev/ttyS1.

       <b>fuser</b> <b>telnet/tcp</b>
              shows all processes at the (local) TELNET port.

</pre><h4><b>RESTRICTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Processes accessing the same file or file system several times in the same way are only shown once.

       If the same object is specified several times on the command line, some of those entries may be ignored.

       <b>fuser</b> may only be able to gather partial information unless run with privileges.  As a consequence, files
       opened  by  processes  belonging  to  other  users may not be listed and executables may be classified as
       mapped only.

       <b>fuser</b> cannot report on any processes that it doesn't have permission to look at the file descriptor table
       for.  The most common time this problem occurs is when looking for TCP or UDP sockets when running  <b>fuser</b>
       as a non-root user.  In this case <b>fuser</b> will report no access.

       Installing  <b>fuser</b>  SUID  root  will  avoid  problems  associated  with  partial  information,  but may be
       undesirable for security and privacy reasons.

       <b>udp</b> and <b>tcp</b> name spaces, and UNIX domain sockets can't be searched with kernels older than 1.3.78.

       Accesses by the kernel are only shown with the <b>-v</b> option.

       The <b>-k</b> option only works on processes.  If the user is the kernel, <b>fuser</b> will print an advice,  but  take
       no action beyond that.

       <b>fuser</b> will not see block devices mounted by processes in a different mount namespace.  This is due to the
       device  ID  shown  in  the  process' file descriptor table being from the process namespace, not fuser's;
       meaning it won't match.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fuser</b> <b>-m</b> <b>/dev/sgX</b> will show (or kill with the <b>-k</b> flag) all processes, even if you don't have that  device
       configured.  There may be other devices it does this for too.

       The  mount  <b>-m</b> option will match any file within the same device as the specified file, use the <b>-M</b> option
       as well if you mean to specify only the mount point.

       <b>fuser</b> will not match mapped files, such as a  process'  shared  libraries  if  they  are  on  a  <b><a href="../man5/btrfs.5.html">btrfs</a></b>(5)
       filesystem due to the device IDs being different for <b><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></b>(2) and <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>&lt;PID&gt;/maps</u>.
