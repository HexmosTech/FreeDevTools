</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       vdr - the Video Disk Recorder

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vdr</b> [options]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vdr</b> implements a complete digital Set-Top Box and Video Recorder.  It can work with signals received from
       satellites (DVB-S) as well as cable (DVB-C) and terrestrial (DVB-T) signals.

       At  least  one DVB card is required to run <b>vdr</b>. With it you can watch live TV while recording one or more
       other broadcasts from the same transponder.  It is also possible to start watching a  recorded  programme
       before  the  live  broadcast  has  ended  (<b>time</b> <b>shifting</b>). In order to record from different transponders
       simultaneously two or more DVB cards are necessary.  By default <b>vdr</b> can support up to  eight  DVB  cards.
       The  primary  DVB  card (the one your TV set is connected to) can either be a "full featured" card, which
       means it contains an MPEG decoder and provides audio and video signal outputs, or you can use some  third
       party plugin that implements software decoding of the MPEG data and displays it via the system's graphics
       adapter.

       <b>vdr</b>  uses  an On Screen Display (OSD) to display its menus.  It can be controlled by the PC keyboard, the
       "Linux Infrared Remote Control" (LIRC), or any other means of remote  control,  implemented  by  a  third
       party plugin.

       Remote access is possible via the "Simple Video Disk Recorder Protocol" (SVDRP), which can be accessed on
       port 6419, for instance by <b>telnet</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b> <u>cmd</u><b>,</b> <b>--audio=</b><u>cmd</u>
              Send Dolby Digital audio to stdin of command <u>cmd</u>.

       <b>--cachedir=</b><u>dir</u>
              Save cache files in <u>dir</u> (default is to save them in the video directory).

       <b>--chartab=</b><u>character_table</u>
              Set  the  character  table  to  use  for  strings  in  the DVB data stream that don't begin with a
              character table indicator, but don't use  the  standard  default  character  table  (for  instance
              ISO-8859-9).

       <b>-c</b> <u>dir</u><b>,</b> <b>--config=</b><u>dir</u>
              Read config files from directory <u>dir</u> (default is to read them from the video directory).

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--daemon</b>
              Run in daemon mode (implies --no-kbd).

       <b>-D</b> <u>num</u><b>,</b> <b>--device=</b><u>num</u>
              Use only the given DVB device (<u>num</u> = 0, 1, 2...).  There may be several <b>-D</b> options (by default all
              DVB  devices  will  be used).  If <b>-D-</b> is given, no DVB devices will be used at all, independent of
              any other -D options.

       <b>--dirnames=</b><u>path</u><b>[,</b><u>name</u><b>[,</b><u>enc</u><b>]]</b>
              Set the maximum directory path length to <u>path</u>  (default  is  the  maximum  value  allowed  on  the
              system).  If  <u>name</u>  is  also  given,  it defines the maximum directory name length (default is the
              maximum value allowed on the system).  The optional <u>enc</u> can  be  0  or  1,  and  controls  whether
              special characters in directory names are encoded as hex values (default: 0).  If <u>path</u> or <u>name</u> are
              left  empty  (as in ",,1" to only set <u>enc</u>), the defaults apply.  The length of the video directory
              name and that of the actual recording  directory  is  subtracted  from  <u>path</u>,  to  make  sure  the
              directory path will never become too long.

       <b>--edit=</b><u>rec</u>
              Edit  the  given recording.  <u>rec</u> must be the full path name of an existing recording.  The program
              will return immediately after editing the recording.

       <b>-E</b> <u>file</u><b>,</b> <b>--epgfile=</b><u>file</u>
              Write the EPG data into the given <u>file</u> (default is <u>epg.data</u> in the cache directory).  Use  <b>-E-</b>  to
              disable this.  If <u>file</u> is a directory, the file <u>epg.data</u> will be created in that directory.

       <b>--filesize=</b><u>size</u>
              Limit  video  files  to  <u>size</u> bytes (default is 2000M).  This option is only useful in conjunction
              with --edit, and must precede that option to have an effect.  <u>size</u> is an integer number and may be
              followed by one of the letters K, M, G or  T  to  abbreviate  Kilo-,  Mega-,  Giga-  or  Terabyte,
              respectively.   The  given value is silently limited to the program's internal minimum and maximum
              values.

       <b>--genindex=</b><u>rec</u>
              Generate the index file for the given recording.  <u>rec</u> must be the full path name  of  an  existing
              recording.   The  recording  must be in TS format.  If the recording already has an index file, it
              will be deleted before creating the new one.  The program will return immediately after generating
              the index.  Note that using this option while another instance of VDR is currently  replaying  the
              given recording, or if the recording has not been finished yet, may lead to unexpected results.

       <b>-g,</b> <b>--grab=</b><u>dir</u>
              Write  images  from the SVDRP command GRAB into the given directory <u>dir</u>. <u>dir</u> must be the full path
              name of an existing directory, without any "..", double '/' or symlinks. By default, or if <b>-g-</b>  is
              given, grabbing images to disk is disabled.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Print a help message and exit.

       <b>-i</b> <u>instance</u><b>,</b> <b>--instance=</b><u>instance</u>
              Use  <u>instance</u>  as  the  id  of  this VDR instance (default is 0).  In an environment where several
              instances of VDR use the same video directory, this parameter can be set  to  a  positive  integer
              value  that's  unique for each instance, so that they won't interfere with each other in case they
              record exactly the same broadcast.  The number given here will be part of the  directory  name  in
              which the recordings will be stored.

       <b>-l</b> <u>level</u><b>,</b> <b>--log=</b><u>level</u>
              Set  logging to <u>level</u>.  <b>0</b> = no logging, <b>1</b> = errors only, <b>2</b> = errors and info, <b>3</b> = errors, info and
              debug.  The default logging level is <b>3</b>.  If logging  should  be  done  to  LOG_LOCAL<u>n</u>  instead  of
              LOG_USER, add '.n' to LEVEL, as in 3.7 (n=0..7).

       <b>-L</b> <u>dir</u><b>,</b> <b>--lib=</b><u>dir</u>
              Search  for  plugins in directory <u>dir</u> (default is ./PLUGINS/lib).  There can be several <b>-L</b> options
              with different <u>dir</u> values.  Each of them will apply to the <b>-P</b> options following it.

       <b>--lirc[=</b><u>path</u><b>]</b>
              Use a LIRC remote control device.  If <u>path</u> is omitted, vdr uses <u>/var/run/lirc/lircd</u>.

       <b>--localedir=</b><u>dir</u>
              Search for locale files in <u>dir</u> (default is ./locale).

       <b>-m,</b> <b>--mute</b>
              Mute audio of the primary DVB device at startup.

       <b>--no-kbd</b>
              Don't use the keyboard as an input device.

       <b>-p</b> <u>port</u><b>,</b> <b>--port=</b><u>port</u>
              Use <u>port</u> for SVDRP. A value of <b>0</b> turns off SVDRP.  The default SVDRP port is <b>6419</b>.   You  need  to
              edit  the  file  <u>svdrphosts.conf</u> in order to enable access to the SVDRP port from hosts other than
              the localhosts.  Note that this option only changes the TCP port used for SVDRP commands.  The UDP
              port for discovering peer VDRs in the same network is always set to 6419 and can't be changed.

       <b>-P</b> <u>options</u><b>,</b> <b>--plugin=</b><u>options</u>
              Load a plugin, defined by the given <u>options</u>.  The first word in <u>options</u> must be  the  name  of  an
              existing  <b>vdr</b>  plugin,  optionally  followed by a blank separated list of command line options for
              that plugin. If <u>options</u> contains any blanks, you need to enclose it in quotes, like for example

              <b>vdr</b> <b>-P</b> <b>"abc</b> <b>-a</b> <b>-b</b> <b>xyz"</b>

              which would load a plugin named <b>abc</b>, giving it the command line options <b>-a</b> <b>-b</b> <b>xyz</b>. If you want  to
              load all available plugins (without any particular options) you can use

              <b>vdr</b> <b>-P</b> <b>"*"</b>

              (note the quotes around the asterisk to prevent wildcard expansion).

       <b>-r</b> <u>cmd</u><b>,</b> <b>--record=</b><u>cmd</u>
              Call <u>cmd</u> before and after a recording. See the file <u>INSTALL</u> for more information.

       <b>--resdir=</b><u>dir</u>
              Read resource files from <u>dir</u> (default is to read them from the config directory).

       <b>--showargs[=</b><u>dir</u><b>]</b>
              Read command line arguments from <u>dir</u> (default is <u>/etc/vdr/conf.d</u>), display them to the console and
              exit.

       <b>-s</b> <u>cmd</u><b>,</b> <b>--shutdown=</b><u>cmd</u>
              Call <u>cmd</u> to shutdown the computer. See the file <u>INSTALL</u> for more information.

       <b>--split</b>
              Split  edited  files at the editing marks.  This option is only useful in conjunction with --edit,
              and must precede that option to have an effect.

       <b>-t</b> <u>tty</u><b>,</b> <b>--terminal=</b><u>tty</u>
              Set the controlling terminal.

       <b>-u</b> <u>user</u><b>,</b> <b>--user=</b><u>user</u>
              Run as user <u>user</u> in case vdr was started as user 'root'.  Starting vdr as 'root' is  necessary  if
              the system time shall be set from the transponder data, but for security reasons vdr can switch to
              a lesser privileged user id during normal operation. <u>user</u> can be a user name or a numerical id.

       <b>--updindex=</b><u>rec</u>
              Update  the  index  file  for  the given recording.  <u>rec</u> must be the full path name of an existing
              recording.  The recording must be in TS format.  If the recording already has an  index  file,  it
              will be checked whether it is complete, and will be updated if it isn't. If there is no index file
              yet,  a  new one will be generated.  The program will return immediately after updating the index.
              Note that using this option while another  instance  of  VDR  is  currently  replaying  the  given
              recording, or if the recording has not been finished yet, may lead to unexpected results.

       <b>--userdump</b>
              Allow coredumps if -u is given (only for debugging).

       <b>--vfat</b> For backwards compatibility (same as --dirnames= 250,40,1).

       <b>-v</b> <u>dir</u><b>,</b> <b>--video=</b><u>dir</u>
              Use <u>dir</u> as video directory.  The default is <u>/video</u>.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Print version information and exit.

       <b>-w</b> <u>sec</u><b>,</b> <b>--watchdog=</b><u>sec</u>
              Activate  the  watchdog  timer with a timeout of <u>sec</u> seconds.  A value of <b>0</b> (default) disables the
              watchdog.

       If started without any options, vdr tries to read command line options from files named '*.conf'  in  the
       directory /etc/vdr/conf.d. Files are read in alphabetical order. See <a href="../man5/vdr.5.html">vdr</a>(5) for details.
