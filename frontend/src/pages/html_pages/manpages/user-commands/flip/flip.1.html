</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       flip, toms, toix - do newline conversions between **IX and MS-DOS

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>flip</b> <b>-h</b>
       <b>flip</b> [ <b>-umvtsbz</b>] <u>file</u> <b>...</b>
       <b>flip</b> [ <b>-umvtsbz</b>] <b>-</b>
       <b>toix</b> [ <b>-vtsbz</b>] <u>file</u> <b>...</b>
       <b>toms</b> [ <b>-vtsbz</b>] <u>file</u> <b>...</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>flip</b>  is a file interchange program that converts text file formats between **ix and MS-DOS.  It converts
       lines ending with carriage-return (CR) and linefeed (LF) to lines ending  with  just  linefeed,  or  vice
       versa.  If the special argument "-" is given, input is read from stdin and written to stdout.

       <b>flip</b> has the following features:

              <b>flip</b> will normally refuse to convert binary files.  You can override this.

              When  asked to convert a file to the same format that it already has, <b>flip</b> causes no change to the
              file.  Thus to convert all files to **IX format you can type

                                  flip -u *

              and all files will end up right, regardless of whether they were in MS-DOS or in  **IX  format  to
              begin with.  This also works in the opposite direction.

              If  a  file  contains isolated CR characters for underlining or overprinting, <b>flip</b> does not change
              them.

              <b>flip</b> preserves file timestamps.  You can override this.

              <b>flip</b> preserves file permissions.

              <b>flip</b> is written in C and will compile and run under MS-DOS/Turbo C, 4.3BSD, and System V.

              <b>flip</b> accepts wildcards and multiple filenames on the command line.

              If a user interrupt aborts <b>flip</b>, it does not leave behind any garbage files or cause corruption of
              the files being converted.

              When converting from MS-DOS to **IX  format,  <b>flip</b>  removes  any  trailing  control  Z  (the  last
              character  in  the  file), but leaves embedded control Z characters unchanged.  This minimizes the
              possibility of accidentally converting a binary file that contains a control Z near the beginning.
              You can override this and ask <b>flip</b> to recognize the first control Z found as end-of-file.

              <b>flip</b> can be asked to strip the high (parity) bit as it converts a file.

       <b>flip</b> is normally invoked as:
                      flip -umhvtb file ...
       One of -u, -m, or -h is required.  Switches may be given separately or combined together  after  a  dash.
       For example, the three command lines given below are equivalent:
                      flip -uvt *.c
                      flip -u -v -t *.c
                      flip -u -vt *.c

       On  systems  that  allow a program to know its own name, <b>flip</b> may be renamed (or linked) to a file called
       toix for conversion to **IX format, or to a file called toms  for  conversion  to  MS-DOS  format.   When
       invoked  with  the  name  toix  or  toms,  <b>flip</b>  will  act as if it were invoked with the -u or -m option
       respectively.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -u     Convert to **IX format (CR LF =&gt; LF, lone CR or LF unchanged, trailing control Z removed, embedded
              control Z unchanged).

       -m     Convert to MS-DOS format (lone LF =&gt; CR LF, lone CR unchanged).

       -h     Give a help message.

       -v     Be verbose, print filenames as they are processed.

       -t     Touch files (don't preserve timestamps).

       -s     Strip high bit.

       -b     Convert binary files too (else binary files are left unchanged).

       -z     Truncate file at first control Z encountered.
