</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       durep - disk usage report generator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       durep [OPTIONS]... [DIRECTORY]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>durep</b> creates disk usage reports with bar graphs, allowing one to easily deduce which directories are
       using the most space. Although <b>durep</b> can produce text output similar to du, its real power lies in the
       ability to store reports in a file, which can then be viewed as a web page with the supplied cgi script.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options are grouped into three distinct sections.

   <b>Text</b> <b>Output</b> <b>Options</b>
       These options are for controlling the text report output.

       <b>-td,</b> <b>--text-depth</b>=<u>N</u>
              Limit  text report on directories to depth <u>N</u>. No directories below this level will be shown in the
              report.

        <b>-hs,</b> <b>--hide-size</b>=<u>N[bkmg]</u>
              Do not display entries using <u>N</u> Bytes/KB/MB/GB or less (default Bytes). This is to  reduce  clutter
              in the reports. It allows you to remove small files from the text report.

        <b>-sd,</b> <b>--show-date</b>
              Display the modification date of the file or directory in the report.

       <b>-ns,</b> <b>--nosort</b>
              Do  not  sort  results  by  size. Leaves results in the order in which they were scanned, which is
              highly dependent on the file system.

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b>
              Do not produce text output. This stops the creation of a text report, and is useful when  you  are
              only interested in generating a save-file for use with the web report.

   <b>File</b> <b>Options</b>
       These options control load and save files.

       <b>-sf,</b> <b>--save-file</b>=<u>FILE</u>
              Save  the  results  of  the  scan  into  this  file.  This can be loaded for a text report, but is
              generally used by the cgi script to display web reports. The filename should end  in  <u>.ds</u>  (it  is
              appended if it does not).

       <b>-lf,</b> <b>--load-file</b>=<u>FILE</u>
              Load the results of a scan from this file. This takes the place of scanning a directory. Inclusion
              options (described below) will not take effect if this option is used.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--desc</b>=<u>DESCRIPTION</u>
              Give  a  description  to  be  stored in the save-file. This is displayed on the web report summary
              page.

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--collate=</b>=<u>DIR</u>
              Collate the save-files in the given directory. This creates a <u>durep.cds</u> file, which is used by the
              cgi script to manage and display save-files. See <b>Web</b> <b>Reports</b> section below for more detail.

   <b>Inclusion</b> <b>Options</b>
       These options control which directories and files should be included in the report.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--files</b>
              Do not descend into sub-directories, only report files.

       <b>-x,</b> <b>--one-file-system</b>
              Do not traverse file systems. This is similar to the <b>-x</b> option for du, allowing easy  checking  of
              an entire file system such as <a href="file:/.">/.</a>

       <b>-cp,</b> <b>--collapse-path=</b><u>PATTERN</u>
              Hide  entries  below  paths that match <u>PATTERN</u>. This allows you to conceal the contents of certain
              directories in the report. You may wish perhaps to show home directories in a report but not  show
              their content in which case you could use the option -cp '<a href="file:/home">/home</a>'.

       <b>-ep,</b> <b>--exclude-path</b>=<u>PATTERN</u>
              Ignore paths that match <u>PATTERN</u>. This works in a similar manner to "-cp" above, except it excludes
              the directory from the scan itself.

       <b>-cf,</b> <b>--coalesce-files=</b>=<u>N[bkmg]</u>
              Coalesces  entries  for  files  below  the  given size into one entry. This is useful for reducing
              clutter in reports.

</pre><h4><b>WEB</b> <b>REPORTS</b></h4><pre>
       Since version 0.9, durep no longer directly generates html files for its web reports. It now uses  a  cgi
       script  that  reads  data  from  save-files. The script will handle multiple save-files, potentially from
       multiple hosts, so you can consolidate your reports into one place. Copying save-files from  other  hosts
       is left as an exercise for the reader.

       It  is  necessary  to collate the save-files before viewing them via the cgi script. This process creates
       the file "durep.cds" which contains meta-data about all of the save-files. From this a  summary  page  is
       shown where you can choose which report you wish to view. The collation must be done any time a save-file
       is added or overwritten.

       The  cgi-script  has  some configurable variables at the top. These tell the script where to look for the
       css file and the graphic used for the bar graphs. There are also options to set whether the  modification
       date,  and/or  the  options  used  to  create  the  save-file should be shown. These are both set to 1 by
       default.

       As always, you should take care when installing the cgi  script.  I've  done  my  best,  but  I  make  no
       guarantees  about  its security. It would probably be unwise to allow this script to be accessed from the
       Internet at large.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       1. <b>durep</b> <b>-td</b> <b>2</b>

          This would print the directory tree starting from the current directory to depth 2.

       2. <b>durep</b> <b>-f</b> <b><a href="file:/var/spool/mail">/var/spool/mail</a></b>

          This might be useful for keeping a check on the mail directory. The "-f" switch tells  durep  to  just
          scan files and not descend into directories.

       3. <b>durep</b> <b>-x</b> <b>-cp</b> <b>"/(etc|usr/share)"</b> <b>-ep</b> <b>"<a href="file:/var">/var</a>"</b> <b>-sf</b> <b>/var/lib/durep/root.ds</b> <b>/</b>

          This  more  complicated  version does the following. It scans the root file system only, collapses the
          contents of any paths beginning <u><a href="file:/etc">/etc</a></u> or <u><a href="file:/usr/share">/usr/share</a></u> and skips the contents of the  <u><a href="file:/var">/var</a></u>  directory.  It
          saves the output of this report into the file <u>/var/lib/durep/root.ds</u>. No text report is produced.

       4. <b>durep</b> <b>-lf</b> <b>/var/lib/durep/root.ds</b> <b>-hs</b> <b>1m</b>

          This  reads  the save-file <u>/var/lib/durep/root.ds</u> and produces a text report from it, hiding any files
          below 1 megabyte.

       5. <b>durep</b> <b>-c</b> <b>/var/lib/durep</b>

          This collates any save-files in <u>/var/lib/durep</u>.
