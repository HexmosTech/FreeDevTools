       The "-report", "-select", "-ignore", "-select_re", "-ignore_re", and "-coverage" options may be specified
       multiple times.

</pre><h4><b>REPORT</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       The following "-report" options are available in the core module.  Other reports may be available if
       they've been installed from external packages.

       html|html_minimal (default)
           HTML  reporting.  Percentage  thresholds  are colour-coded and configurable via -report_c0 &lt;integer&gt;,
           -report_c1 &lt;integer&gt; and -report_c2 &lt;integer&gt;.:

               0%      75%      90%      100%
               |   ..   |   ..   |   ..   |
                  &lt;c0      &lt;c1      &lt;c2   c3
                  red     yellow   orange green

       html_basic
           HTML reporting with  syntax  highlighting  if  PPI::HTML  or  Perl::Tidy  module  is  detected.  Like
           html|html_minimal reporting, percentage thresholds are colour-coded and configurable.

       text
           Plain text reporting.

       compilation
           A  textual  report in a format similar to that output by Perl itself such that the report may be used
           by your editor or other reporting tools to show where coverage is missing.

       json
           A report in JSON format.

       vim A report suitable for use with the vim editor to show coverage data in the sign column.

</pre><h4><b>DETAILS</b></h4><pre>
       Any number of coverage databases may be specified on the command line.  These databases  will  be  merged
       and  the  reports  will  be  based  on the merged information.  If no databases are specified the default
       database (cover_db) will be used.

       The "-write" option will write out the merged database.  If no name is given for the  new  database,  the
       first  database  read  in  will  be  overwritten.   When  this option is used no reports are generated by
       default.

       Specify the "-select", "-select_re", "-ignore", and "-ignore_re" options to  report  on  specific  files.
       "-select"  and "-ignore" are interpreted as shell globs; "-select_re" and "-ignore_re" are interpreted as
       regular expressions.

       Specify "-coverage" options to report on specific criteria.  By default all available information on  all
       criteria  in  all  files  will be reported.  Available coverage options are statement, branch, condition,
       subroutine, pod, and default (which equates to all available options).  However, if  you  know  you  only
       want  coverage  information  for certain criteria it is better to only collect data for those criteria in
       the first place by specifying them at that point.  This will  make  the  data  collection  and  reporting
       processes faster and less memory intensive.  See the documentation for Devel::Cover for more information.

       If you want all *except* some criteria, then you can say something like "-coverage default,-pod".

       If  you  specify  multiple  "-report"  options,  make  sure  that they do not conflict.  For example, the
       different HTML reports will overwrite each other's results.

       The "-test" option will delete the databases and run your tests to  generate  new  coverage  data  before
       reporting  on  it.   Devel::Cover knows how to work with standard Perl Makefiles as well as Module::Build
       based distributions.   For  detailed  instructions  see  the  documentation  for  ExtUtils::MakeMaker  at
       &lt;https://metacpan.org/module/ExtUtils::MakeMaker&gt;         or         for         Module::Build         at
       &lt;https://metacpan.org/module/Module::Build&gt; both of which come as standard in recent Perl distributions.

       The "-gcov" option will try to run gcov on any XS code.  This requires that you are using gcc of  course.
       If  you are using the "-test" option will be turned on by default. If you have XS code in subdirectories,
       you will probably need to add the "-gcov_chdir" option since gcov seems to work better with that.

       The "-prefer_lib" option tells Devel::Cover to report on files in the lib directory  even  if  they  were
       used from the blib directory.

       The "-ignore_covered_err" option will not flag an error if uncoverable code is covered.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values are returned:

       0   All operations were completed successfully.

       &gt;0  An error occurred.

       With the -test option the exit status of the underlying test run is returned.
