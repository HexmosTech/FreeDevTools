</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sarg-reports - Daily/Weekly/Monthly squid usage reports creation tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sarg-reports</b> [OPTIONS]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the <b>sarg-reports</b> command.

       <b>sarg-reports</b>  is  a  script  written to automate the SARG (a powerful squid log analyzer) reports and log
       management.  Sarg itself, provide to end user a generic interface to create reports based on squid access
       log (begin of log to current date).  sarg-reports is useful because it allow  you  to  easly  create  and
       manage Daily, Weekly and Monthly reports.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       A summary of options is included below.

       <b>manual</b>
              Create Manual report

       <b>today</b>  Create Today report

       <b>daily</b>  Create Daily report

       <b>weekly</b> Create Weely report

       <b>monthly</b>
              Create Monthly report

</pre><h4><b>CRONTAB</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  want  the  reports  can  be generated automatically insert the following lines (the today report
       creation time depend mostly of your sarg server load average, tune it):

       PATH=<a href="file:/usr/local/sbin">/usr/local/sbin</a>:<a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a>:<a href="file:/usr/sbin">/usr/sbin</a>:<a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a>:<a href="file:/sbin">/sbin</a>:<a href="file:/bin">/bin</a>
       00 08-18/1 * * * sarg-reports today
       00 00      * * * sarg-reports daily
       00 01      * * 1 sarg-reports weekly
       30 02      1 * * sarg-reports monthly

       REMEMBER:  if you use logrotate, configure it to retain enough logs to ensure availability  of  data  for
       the   longest  period  for  which  you  need  a  report.  Log  rotation  frequency  is  unimportant.  See
       https://sourceforge.net/p/sarg/wiki/Keeping%20enough%20log%20to%20process/ This version  of  sarg-reports
       will  use  the log file defined in sarg.conf and also prior log files which have been rotated out of that
       location.
