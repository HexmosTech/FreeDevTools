       kyua report-html — Generates an HTML report with the results of a test suite run

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>kyua</b> <b>report-html</b> [<b>--force</b>] [<b>--output</b> <u>path</u>] [<b>--results-file</b> <u>file</u>] [<b>--results-filter</b> <u>types</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>kyua</b>  <b>report-html</b> command provides a simple mechanism to generate HTML reports of the execution of a
       test suite.  The command processes a results file and then populates a directory with multiple  HTML  and
       supporting files to describe the results recorded in that results file.

       The  HTML  output is static and self-contained, so it can easily be served by any simple web server.  The
       command expects the target directory to not exist,  because  it  would  overwrite  any  contents  if  not
       careful.

       The following subcommand options are recognized:

       <b>--force</b>
           Forces  the deletion of the output directory if it exists.  Use care, as this effectively means a ‘rm
           -rf’.

       <b>--output</b> <u>directory</u>
           Specifies the target directory into which to generate the HTML files.  The directory must  not  exist
           unless the <b>--force</b> option is provided.  The default is <u>./html</u>.

       <b>--results-file</b> <u>path</u>, <b>-s</b> <u>path</u>
           Specifies  the  results  file  to operate on.  Defaults to ‘LATEST’, which causes <b>kyua</b> <b>report-html</b> to
           automatically load the latest results file from the current test suite.

           The following values are accepted:

           ‘LATEST’
               Requests the load of the latest results file available for the test suite rooted at  the  current
               directory.

           Directory
               Requests  the  load  of  the latest results file available for the test suite rooted at the given
               directory.

           Test suite name
               Requests the load of the latest results file available for the given test suite.

           Results identifier
               Requests the load of a specific results file.

           Explicit file name (aka everything else)
               Load the specified results file.

           See “Results files” for more details.

       <b>--results-filter</b> <u>types</u>
           Comma-separated list of the test result types to include in the report.  The ordering of  the  values
           is respected so that you can determine how you want the list of tests to be shown.

           The valid values are: ‘broken’, ‘failed’, ‘passed’, ‘skipped’ and ‘xfail’.  If the parameter supplied
           to the option is empty, filtering is suppressed and all result types are shown in the report.

           The  default  value for this flag includes all the test results except the passed tests.  Showing the
           passed tests by default clutters the report with too much information, so  only  abnormal  conditions
           are included.

   <b>Results</b> <b>files</b>
       Results  files  contain,  as their name implies, the results of the execution of a test suite.  Each test
       suite executed by <u><a href="../man1/kyua-test.1.html">kyua-test</a></u>(1) generates a new results file, and such results files can be  loaded  later
       on by inspection commands such as <u><a href="../man1/kyua-report.1.html">kyua-report</a></u>(1) to analyze their contents.

       Results  files  support identifier-based lookups and also path name lookups.  The differences between the
       two are described below.

       The default naming scheme for the results files provides simple support for identifier-based lookups  and
       historical  recording of test suite runs.  Each results file is given an identifier derived from the test
       suite that generated it and the time the test suite was run.  Kyua can later look  up  results  files  by
       these fields.

       The identifier follows this pattern:

             &lt;test_suite&gt;.&lt;YYYYMMDD&gt;-&lt;HHMMSS&gt;-&lt;uuuuuu&gt;

       where  ‘test_suite’  is  the path to the root of the test suite that was run with all slashes replaced by
       underscores and ‘YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-uuuuuu’ is a timestamp with microsecond resolution.

       When using the default naming scheme, results files are stored in  the  <u><a href="file:~/.kyua/store/">~/.kyua/store/</a></u>  subdirectory  and
       each file holds a name of the form:

             <a href="file:~/.kyua/store/results.">~/.kyua/store/results.</a>&lt;identifier&gt;.db

       Results    files    are    simple    SQLite    databases    with    the    schema    described   in   the
       <u>/usr/share/kyua/store/schema_v?.sql</u> files.  For details on  the  schema,  please  refer  to  the  heavily
       commented SQL file.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>kyua</b> <b>report-html</b> command always returns 0.

       Additional exit codes may be returned as described in <u><a href="../man1/kyua.1.html">kyua</a></u>(1).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Workflow</b> <b>with</b> <b>results</b> <b>files</b>
       If one runs the following command twice in a row:

             kyua test -k /usr/tests/Kyuafile

       the two executions will generate two different files with names like:

             <a href="file:~/.kyua/store/results.usr_tests.20140731-150500-196784.db">~/.kyua/store/results.usr_tests.20140731-150500-196784.db</a>
             <a href="file:~/.kyua/store/results.usr_tests.20140731-151730-997451.db">~/.kyua/store/results.usr_tests.20140731-151730-997451.db</a>

       Taking advantage of the default naming scheme, the following commands would all generate a report for the
       results of the <u>latest</u> execution of the test suite:

             cd /usr/tests &amp;&amp; kyua report-html
             cd /usr/tests &amp;&amp; kyua report-html --results-file=LATEST
             kyua report-html --results-file=/usr/tests
             kyua report-html --results-file=usr_tests
             kyua report-html --results-file=usr_tests.20140731-151730-997451

       But it is also possible to explicitly load data for older runs or from explicitly-named files:

             kyua report-html \
                 --results-file=usr_tests.20140731-150500-196784
             kyua report-html \
                 --results-file=<a href="file:~/.kyua/store/results.usr_tests.20140731-150500-196784.db">~/.kyua/store/results.usr_tests.20140731-150500-196784.db</a>
