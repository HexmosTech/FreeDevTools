</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sreport - Generate reports from the slurm accounting data.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sreport</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>...] [<u>COMMAND</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sreport</b>  is  used  to  generate  reports of job usage and cluster utilization for Slurm jobs saved to the
       Slurm Database, <b>slurmdbd</b>. Report data comes from hourly, daily, and monthly rollups  of  accounting  data
       that  occur  automatically  in the background. Data will be pulled from the rollup table with the longest
       interval that can satisfy the  requested  report  period.  For  example,  a  report  on  the  time  range
       "Start=01/01  End=03/01"  will  be  able  to  pull  from  the  monthly  rollup table, while a report with
       "Start=01/01-03:00 End=03/01" will need to use the hourly rollup table.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b>, <b>--all_clusters</b>
              Use all clusters instead of only the cluster from which the command was executed.

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--cluster</b>
              The cluster(s) to generate reports for. Default is local cluster,  unless  the  local  cluster  is
              currently  part of a federation and in that case generate a report for all clusters in the current
              federation. If the clusters included in a  federation  vary  through  time,  use  this  option  to
              identify the clusters to be included in report. Implies --local.

       <b>--federation</b>
              Generate a report for the federation if a member of one.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print a help message describing the usage of <b>sreport</b>.

       <b>--local</b>
              Generate a report for the local cluster, even if part of a federation.  Overrides <b>--federation</b>.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--noheader</b>
              Don't display header when listing results.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--parsable</b>
              Output will be '|' delimited with a '|' at the end.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--parsable2</b>
              Output will be '|' delimited without a '|' at the end.

       <b>-Q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
              Print no warning or informational messages, only error messages.

       <b>-t</b> &lt;<u>time_format</u>&gt;
              Specify  the  output time format. Time format options are case insensitive and may be abbreviated.
              The default format is Minutes.  Supported time format options  are  listed  in  the  <b>time</b>  command
              section below.

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--tres</b>=&lt;<u>tres_names</u>&gt;
              Trackable  resource  (TRES) to report values for.  By default CPU resource use is reported (except
              for reservation reports. All TRES types reserved by a reservation will be shown by default  unless
              overridden  with  this option).  Multiple TRES names may be separated using a comma separated list
              for all reports except the job reports, which can only support a single TRES name,  or  "ALL"  for
              all TRES.

              The "Reported" Billing TRES is calculated from the largest Billing TRES of each node multiplied by
              the  time  frame.  For  example, if a node is part of multiple partitions and each has a different
              TRESBillingWeights defined the Billing TRES for the node will be the highest of the partitions. If
              TRESBillingWeights is not defined on any partition for a node then the Billing TRES will be  equal
              to the number of CPUs on the node.

              TRES node usage is no longer reported in percent format or in Cluster Utilization. Please use TRES
              CPU  instead.   The main issue with using node is in most configurations multiple jobs are able to
              run on the same node. This makes TRES node accounting count the same node multiple  times  in  the
              same  period.  In  exclusive  node  configurations,  CPU  accounting  returns  the same usage node
              accounting would.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Print detailed event logging.

       <b>-V</b> , <b>--version</b>
              Print version information and exit.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>

       process commands as entered until explicitly terminated.

       <b>exit</b>   Terminate the execution of sreport.  Identical to the <b>quit</b> command.

       <b>help</b>   Display a description of sreport options and commands.

       <b>nonparsable</b>
              Return output to normal after parsable or parsable2 has been set.

              Output will be | delimited with an ending '|'.

       <b>parsable2</b>
              Output will be | delimited without an ending '|'.

       <b>quiet</b>  Print no warning or informational messages, only fatal error messages.

       <b>quit</b>   Terminate the execution of sreport.  Identical to the <b>exit</b> command.

       <b>time</b> <b>&lt;time_format&gt;</b>
              Specify the output time format. Time format options are case insensitive and may  be  abbreviated.
              The default format is Minutes.  Supported time format options include:

              <b>SecPer</b>    Seconds/Percentage of Total

</pre><h4><b>REPORT</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       Valid report types are:

              <b>cluster</b> &lt;REPORT&gt; &lt;OPTIONS&gt;

              <b>job</b> &lt;REPORT&gt; &lt;OPTIONS&gt;

              <b>reservation</b> &lt;REPORT&gt; &lt;OPTIONS&gt;

              <b>user</b> &lt;REPORT&gt; &lt;OPTIONS&gt;

       &lt;REPORT&gt; options for each type include:

              <b>cluster</b>
                     AccountUtilizationByUser,         AccountUtilizationByQOS,        UserUtilizationByAccount,
                     UserUtilizationByWckey, Utilization, WCKeyUtilizationByUser

              <b>job</b>    SizesByAccount, SizesByAccountAndWcKey, SizesByWckey

              <b>reservation</b>
                     Utilization

              <b>user</b>   TopUsage

       <b>NOTE</b>: If <b>OverSubscribe</b> is configured to <b>FORCE</b> or <b>YES</b> in your slurm.conf and the system is not  configured
       to  use  preemption  (<b>PreemptMode=OFF</b>)  accounting  can  easily  grow  to  values greater than the actual
       utilization. It may be common on such systems to get error messages in the slurmdbd log stating: "We have
       more allocated time than is possible."

</pre><h4><b>REPORT</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cluster</b> <b>AccountUtilizationByUser</b>
              This report will display account utilization as it appears on the hierarchical tree. Starting with
              the specified account or the root account by default this report will list  the  underlying  usage
              with a sum on each level. Use the 'tree' option to span the tree for better visibility.

              <b>NOTE</b>:  Idle  reservation time will be split evenly among accounts/users given access to it. When a
              reservation is assigned to whole accounts, the time will be counted in  the  association  for  the
              accounts,  not  the user associations in the accounts. In this case, the usage of a parent account
              can be larger than the sum of its children.

       <b>cluster</b> <b>AccountUtilizationByQOS</b>
              This report will display account utilization as it appears on the hierarchical tree. Starting with
              the root account by default, or with the specified account, this report will list  the  underlying
              usage  in  each  account,  with  a sum on each level. Use the 'tree' option to expand the tree for
              better visibility. Users are not displayed here, only parent accounts.

              <b>NOTE</b>: Idle reservation time will be split evenly among accounts that have access to it.  Since  no
              QOS  is  directly connected with the idle time, the time is counted against the default QOS of the
              account, or 'normal' when there is no default.

              <b>NOTE</b>: If you reroll data in the database and have changed the default QOS  on  an  association  to
              something  other  than  what  was  there at the time of the original rollup, you can get different
              data.

       <b>cluster</b> <b>UserUtilizationByAccount</b>
              This report will display users by account  in  order  of  utilization  without  grouping  multiple
              accounts by user into one, but displaying them on separate lines.

       <b>cluster</b> <b>UserUtilizationByWCKey</b>
              This report will display users by wckey in order of utilization without grouping multiple wckey by
              user into one, but displaying them on separate lines.

       <b>cluster</b> <b>Utilization</b>
              This  report  will  display  total  usage divided amongst Allocated, Down, Planned Down, Idle, and
              Planned time for selected clusters.

              Refer to the later section for descriptions of these fields.

              Note: Reservations created with the IGNORE_JOBS flag are not tracked in  the  Cluster  Utilization
              report due to the fact that allowing any current/active jobs to continue to run in the reservation
              introduces  the  possibility  for  them  to  be  accounted  for  incorrectly.   The  jobs in these
              reservations will be tracked as normal rather than being bundled in the reservation time, as  they
              are with reservations that do not have the IGNORE_JOBS flag.

              Note:  The  default  view  for  the  "Cluster  Utilization"  report includes the following fields:
              Cluster, Allocated, Down, PlannedDown, Idle, Planned, Reported. You can include additional  fields
              like OverCommitted and TresCount fields with the <b>Format</b> option. The TresName will also be included
              if using the <b>-T,</b> <b>--tres</b> <b>&lt;tres_names&gt;</b> option.

       <b>cluster</b> <b>WCKeyUtilizationByUser</b>
              This report will display wckey utilization sorted by WCKey name for each user on each cluster.

       <b>job</b> <b>SizesByAccount</b>
              This  report  will  display  the  amount  of time used for job ranges specified by the 'grouping='
              option. Only a single level in the tree is displayed defaulting to the root dir.  If  you  specify
              other  accounts with the 'account=' option sreport will use those accounts as the root account and
              you will receive the aggregated totals of each listed account plus their sub accounts.

       <b>job</b> <b>SizesByAccountAndWckey</b>
              This report is very similar to SizesByAccount with the difference being each account is pair  with
              wckeys  so  the  identifier  is account:wckey instead of just account so there will most likely be
              multiple accounts listed depending on the number of wckeys used.

       <b>job</b> <b>SizesByWckey</b>
              This report will display the amount of time for  each  wckey  for  job  ranges  specified  by  the
              'grouping=' option.

       <b>reservation</b> <b>Utilization</b>
              This report will display total usage for reservations on the systems.  Note: Time requests on this
              report will not truncate the time the reservation used, only the reservations that ran at any time
              during the period requested.

       <b>user</b> <b>TopUsage</b>
              Displays  the  top  users  on  a cluster, i.e. users with the highest usage.  By default users are
              sorted by CPUTime, but the -T, --tres option will sort users by the first TRES specified.

              Use the group option to group accounts together.  The default is to have a different line for each
              user account combination.

       Each report type has various options...

       <b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>ALL</b> <b>REPORT</b> <b>TYPES</b>

              <b>All_Clusters</b>
                     Use all monitored clusters. Default is local cluster.

              <b>Clusters=&lt;OPT&gt;</b>
                     List of clusters to include in report. Default is local cluster.

              <b>End=&lt;OPT&gt;</b>
                     Period ending for report. Default is 23:59:59 of previous day. Note that while minutes  and
                     seconds  are  recognized,  they  will  be  rounded to the nearest hour as reports cannot be
                     generated for a more specific time range.  Valid time formats are...

                     HH:MM[:SS] [AM|PM]
                     MMDD[YY] or MM/DD[/YY] or MM.DD[.YY]
                     MM/DD[/YY]-HH:MM[:SS]
                     YYYY-MM-DD[THH:MM[:SS]]
                     now[{+|-}<u>count</u>[seconds(default)|minutes|hours|days|weeks]]

              <b>Format=&lt;OPT&gt;</b>
                     Comma separated list of fields to display in report.

                     When using the format option for listing various fields you can put a %NUMBER afterwards to
                     specify how many characters should be printed.

                     e.g. format=name%30 will print 30 characters of field name  right  justified.  A  -30  will
                     print 30 characters left justified.

              <b>Start=&lt;OPT&gt;</b>
                     Period  start  for report. Default is 00:00:00 of previous day. Note that while minutes and
                     seconds are recognized, they will be rounded to the  nearest  hour  as  reports  cannot  be
                     generated for a more specific time range.  Valid time formats are...

                     HH:MM[:SS] [AM|PM]
                     MMDD[YY] or MM/DD[/YY] or MM.DD[.YY]
                     MM/DD[/YY]-HH:MM[:SS]
                     YYYY-MM-DD[THH:MM[:SS]]
                     now[{+|-}<u>count</u>[seconds(default)|minutes|hours|days|weeks]]

       <b>OPTIONS</b> <b>SPECIFICALLY</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>CLUSTER</b> <b>REPORTS</b>

              <b>Accounts=&lt;OPT&gt;</b>
                     When  used  with  the  UserUtilizationByAccount, or AccountUtilizationBy[User|QOS], List of
                     accounts to include in report.  Default is all.

              <b>Tree</b>   When used with the AccountUtilizationBy[User|QOS] report will span the accounts as they are
                     in the hierarchy.

              <b>Users=&lt;OPT&gt;</b>
                     When used with any report other than Utilization, List  of  users  to  include  in  report.
                     Default is all.

              <b>Wckeys=&lt;OPT&gt;</b>
                     When  used  with  the  UserUtilizationByWckey  or WCKeyUtilizationByUser, List of wckeys to
                     include in report. Default is all.

       <b>OPTIONS</b> <b>SPECIFICALLY</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>JOB</b> <b>REPORTS</b>

              <b>Accounts=&lt;OPT&gt;</b>
                     List of accounts to use for the report. Default is  all  which  will  show  only  one  line
                     corresponding  to  the  totals of all accounts in the hierarchy.  This explanation does not
                     apply when ran with the FlatView or AcctAsParent options.

              <b>AcctAsParent</b>
                     When used with the SizesbyAccount(*) will take specified accounts as parents and  the  next
                     layer  of  accounts under those specified will be displayed. Default is root if no specific
                     Accounts are requested.  When FlatView is used, this option is ignored.

              <b>FlatView</b>
                     When used with the SizesbyAccount(*) will not group accounts in a hierarchical  level,  but
                     print each account where jobs ran on a separate line without any hierarchy.

              <b>GID=&lt;OPT&gt;</b>
                     List of group ids to include in report. Default is all.

              <b>Grouping=&lt;OPT&gt;</b>
                     Comma  separated  list  of size groupings. (e.g. 50,100,150 would group job cpu count 1-49,
                     50-99, 100-149, &gt; 150). grouping=individual will result in a single  column  for  each  job
                     size found.

              <b>Jobs=&lt;OPT&gt;</b>
                     List of jobs/steps to include in report. Default is all.

              <b>Nodes=&lt;OPT&gt;</b>
                     Only show jobs that ran on these nodes. Default is all.

              <b>Partitions=&lt;OPT&gt;</b>
                     List of partitions jobs ran on to include in report. Default is all.

              <b>PrintJobCount</b>
                     When used with the Sizes report will print number of jobs ran instead of time used.

              <b>Users=&lt;OPT&gt;</b>
                     List of users jobs to include in report. Default is all.

</pre><h4><b>EXPLANATION</b> <b>OF</b> <b>REPORT</b> <b>FIELDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Account</b>
              Account name

       <b>Allocated</b>
              <b>Cluster</b> <b>utilization</b> <b>report:</b> Time that nodes were in use with active jobs or an active reservation.
              This does not include reservations created with the MAINT or IGNORE_JOBS flags.

              <b>Reservation</b> <b>reports:</b> Time that nodes were in use with active jobs in this reservation

       <b>Associations</b>
              Associations allowed in the reservation

       <b>Cluster</b>
              Cluster name

       <b>Down</b>   <b>Cluster</b>  <b>utilization</b>  <b>report</b>  <b>only:</b>  Time that nodes were marked as Down or fully Drained, or time
              that slurmctld was not responding (if TrackSlurmctldDown is set in slurmdbd.conf)

       <b>End</b>    <b>Reservation</b> <b>reports</b> <b>only:</b> End time

       <b>Energy</b> Energy use (if tracking energy consumption)

       <b>Flags</b>  <b>Reservation</b> <b>reports</b> <b>only:</b> Flags applied to the reservation

       <b>Idle</b>   <b>Cluster</b> <b>utilization</b> <b>report:</b> Time that nodes were not Allocated, Down, PlannedDown, or Planned

              <b>Reservation</b> <b>reports:</b> Time that nodes were not Allocated

       <b>Login</b>  User's login name

       <b>Name</b>   <b>Reservation</b> <b>reports</b> <b>only:</b> Reservation name

       <b>OverCommitted</b>
              <b>Cluster</b> <b>utilization</b> <b>report</b> <b>only:</b> Time of eligible jobs waiting in the queue over the Planned time.
              This contains any overflow of Planned time that would otherwise exceed the Reported  time.  It  is
              typically useful to determine whether your system is overloaded and by how much.

       <b>Planned</b>
              <b>Cluster</b>  <b>utilization</b>  <b>report</b>  <b>only:</b>  Time  that nodes were not Allocated, Down or PlannedDown with
              eligible jobs in the queue that were unable to start due to time or size constraints. If Allocated
              plus Planned time exceeds the Reported time, the excess will be reported as OverCommitted. If this
              value is not of importance for you then the number can be grouped with idle time.

       <b>PlannedDown</b>
              <b>Cluster</b> <b>utilization</b> <b>report</b> <b>only:</b> Time that nodes were in use by a  reservation  created  with  the
              MAINT  flag but not the IGNORE_JOBS flag. Also, time that nodes were in the FUTURE or POWERED_DOWN
              state.

       <b>Proper</b> <b>Name</b>
              User's proper/real name

       <b>Reported</b>
              <b>Cluster</b> <b>utilization</b> <b>report</b> <b>only:</b> Total time that records are available for.  Nodes that were added
              to or removed from the cluster during the report period will only contribute usage  data  for  the
              time they were present in the cluster and cause percentage calculations to deviate from 100%.

       <b>ReservationId</b>
              <b>Reservation</b> <b>reports</b> <b>only:</b> Reservation ID

       <b>Start</b>  <b>Reservation</b> <b>reports</b> <b>only:</b> Start time

       <b>TotalTime</b>
              <b>Reservation</b> <b>reports</b> <b>only:</b> Amount of time the reservation was valid

       <b>TresCount</b>
              Number of TRES present

       <b>TresName</b>
              Name of TRES reported

       <b>TresTime</b>
              <b>Reservation</b> <b>reports</b> <b>only:</b> Total TRES-time in the reservation

       <b>Used</b>   Used TRES-minutes

       <b>Wckey</b>  Workload Characterization Key

</pre><h4><b>PERFORMANCE</b></h4><pre>
       Executing  <b>sreport</b> sends a remote procedure call to <b>slurmdbd</b>. If enough calls from <b>sreport</b> or other Slurm
       client commands that send remote procedure calls to the <b>slurmdbd</b> daemon come in at once, it can result in
       a degradation of performance of the <b>slurmdbd</b> daemon, possibly resulting in a denial of service.

       Do not run <b>sreport</b> or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to <b>slurmdbd</b> from loops
       in shell scripts or other programs.  Ensure that programs limit calls to <b>sreport</b> to the minimum necessary
       for the information you are trying to gather.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Some <b>sreport</b> options may be set via environment variables. These environment variables, along with  their
       corresponding  options,  are  listed  below.   (Note:  Command  line  options  will always override these
       settings.)

       <b>SREPORT_CLUSTER</b>     Same as <b>-M</b>, <b>--cluster</b>

       <b>SREPORT_FEDERATION</b>  Same as --federation

       <b>SREPORT_LOCAL</b>       Same as --local

       <b>SREPORT_TRES</b>        Same as <b>-t,</b> <b>--tres</b>

       <b>SLURM_CONF</b>          The location of the Slurm configuration file.
