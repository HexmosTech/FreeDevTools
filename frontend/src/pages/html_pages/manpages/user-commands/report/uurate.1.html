</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       uurate - Report Taylor UUCP statistics

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>uurate</b> [ <b>-acdefhipqtvx</b> ] [ <b>-s</b> <u>host</u>  ] [ <u>-I</u> <u>config</u>  ][ <u>logfile...</u> ]

       or simply,

       <b>uurate</b>

       for a traffic summary report.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>uurate</u>  command provides tabular summary reports on the operation of the Taylor UUCP system. Data is
       taken from the currently active log files, standard input, or from a list  of  log  files  given  on  the
       command  line.  Output  is  in  the  form of tabular reports summarizing call, file transfer, and command
       execution (<u>uuxqt</u>) activity.

       The log and stats files given to <u>uurate</u> must be in the ``Taylor'' or ``V2'' format. Also, note that  call
       and  file transfer activities are logged in separate files, nominally called <u>Log</u> and <u>Stats,</u> respectively.
       For reports to be meaningful, the <u>Log</u> and <u>Stats</u> files should be given to <u>uurate</u> together, and  cover  the
       same time period.

       If  neither  the  <b>-i</b>  or <b>-I</b> option nor any <u>logfile</u> options are given, <u>uurate</u> defaults to taking its input
       from the current Taylor <u>Log</u> and <u>Stats</u> files. The names are either as defined at compilation time, in case
       there is no config file, or  taken  from  the  arguments  of  the  keywords  <u>logfile</u>  and  <u>statfile</u>  when
       encountered in the config file.  This is the normal mode of operation.

       The reporting options described below can be used to select the set of reports desired. If no options are
       given,  a summary report is displayed. If there is no relevant data for a particular report or host, that
       report or host will be suppressed.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options may be given to <u>uurate:</u>

       <b>-a</b>   All reports. Identical to <b>-cfexp.</b>

       <b>-c</b>   Report on call statistics. Requires data from a <u>Log</u> file.

       <b>-d</b>   will print the default config file to be used.

       <b>-e</b>   Report on efficiency (total connect time versus time spent transferring files). Requires  data  from
            both a <u>Log</u> and a <u>Stats</u> file, and they must span the same time period.

       <b>-f</b>   Report on file transfer statistics. Requires data from a <u>Stats</u> file.

       <b>-h</b>   will print a short help information.

       <b>-i</b>   tells uurate to read any logfile information from standard input.

       <b>-p</b>   report on protocol errors and packets sent/received

       <b>-q</b>   do not print the Environment information,

       <b>-t</b>   All reports. Identical to <b>-cfexp.</b>  plus the <b>Compact</b> <b>summary.</b>

       <b>-v</b>   will print the version id string

       <b>-x</b>   Report on remote execution requests (e.g., <u>rmail</u>).  Requires data from a <u>Log</u> file.

       <b>-s</b> <u>host</u>
            Restrict report output to <u>host.</u>

       <b>-I</b> <u>config</u> <u>file</u>
            an alternate config file may be passed by this option.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b> <b>OF</b> <b>REPORTS</b></h4><pre>
       There are four reports available: the call, file transfer, efficiency, and remote execution reports. Each
       may  be  selected  by a command line option. All reports may be selected via the options <b>-a</b> or <b>-t.</b>  If no
       report selection options are given, <u>uurate</u> displays a compact traffic summary report (see below).

   <b>Summary</b> <b>report</b>
       If no report options are given, <u>uurate</u> displays a traffic summary report. This is particularly useful  in
       daily  <u>cron</u>  jobs  which  report  on  errors  and  the like. Traffic statistics for each active system is
       reported on a single line. If more than one system was active, a 'totals' line is included at the end  of
       the report.

   <b>Protocol</b> <b>packet</b> <b>report</b>
       The protocol report gives statistics on min/max packet and window sizes used during transmission. Further
       on  data  is  collected  for packets transferred. The data is collected for each host/protocol type.  The
       fields are described below:

          <b>site</b>      UUCP node name of neighbor host system,
          <b>typ</b>       Type of protocol used
          <b>Min</b>       minimum packet/window size
          <b>Max</b>       maximum packet/window size
          <b>sent</b>      packets sent
          <b>resent</b>    packets resent
          <b>received</b>  packets received

   <b>Protocol</b> <b>error</b> <b>report</b>
       The protocol report gives statistics on packet errors during transmission. The data is collected for each
       host/protocol type.  The fields are described below:

          <b>site</b>           UUCP node name of neighbor host system,
          <b>typ</b>            Type of protocol used
          <b>header</b>         number of errors in header
          <b>checksum</b>       number of checksum errors
          <b>order</b>          number of order errors
          <b>resent</b>         number packets resent
          <b>rem-reject</b>     packets that the remote site rejected

   <b>Call</b> <b>report</b>
       The call report gives statistics on inbound and outbound calls for each active host  system.  The  fields
       are described below:

          <b>site</b>      UUCP node name of neighbor host system,
          <b>succ.</b>     Successful calls attempted to/by that system,
          <b>failed</b>    Failed calls to/by that system,
          <b>total</b>     Total calls to/by that system,
          <b>time</b>      Collected connect time (hh:mm:ss) for all calls,

   <b>File</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>reports</b>
       The file transfer reports give statistics on inbound and outbound file transfers (regardless of which end
       initiated  the  transfer)  for  each active host system. There are two reports, one for files sent to the
       remote system and one for files received from the remote system. The fields in each report are  described
       below:

          <b>site</b>        UUCP node name of neighbor host system
          <b>files</b>       Number of files transferred
          <b>Bytes/1000</b>  Total size of files transferred given in thousands
          <b>xfr</b> <b>time</b>    Total time (hh:mm:ss) spent on transfer the files,
          <b>B/sec</b>       Average transfer rate (bytes/sec).

   <b>Efficiency</b> <b>report</b>
       The  efficiency  report  describes  the utilization of the links to each active remote system, giving the
       ratio of total connect time to the time spent actually transferring  files.   The  fields  are  described
       below:

          <b>site</b>       UUCP node name of neighbor host system
          <b>connected</b>  Total connect time for that system (turn-around)
          <b>xfr</b> <b>time</b>   Total file transfer time for that system
          <b>overhead</b>   Connect time not used to transfer files,
          <b>eff.</b> <b>%</b>     Ratio of connect time to transfer time (xfer*100/conn)

   <b>Command</b> <b>executions</b> <b>report</b>
       The remote execution report describes remotely requested command executions from each active host system,
       like  <u>rmail</u>  and <u>rnews</u>.  Up to eight command names are displayed. If there are more, the rest will be put
       together in an `Misc.' column.  The fields are described below:

          <b>site</b>        UUCP node name of neighbor host system,
          <b>(command)</b>   Number of requests of this command,
          <b>Misc.</b>       Number of other requests, if more than eight.

   <b>FILES</b>
       The file names below may be changed at compilation time or by the configuration file, so these  are  only
       approximations.
          <u>/usr/spool/uucp/Log</u>   V2/Taylor format call/execution log,
          <u>/usr/spool/uucp/Stats</u> V2/Taylor format file transfer log.

   <b>BUGS</b>
       Does  not  understand  other  than  V2/TAYLOR  logging  formats.  Anyone care to volunteer to add the not
       mentioned?

       Scanning the arguments of logfile and statfile keywords in config should handle lines continued with  the
       backslash as well.

       The  <b>failfm</b>  field  in the call statistics table is always zero, unless something really serious happens,
       e.g. uucico got SIGQUIT or the whole system crashed.
