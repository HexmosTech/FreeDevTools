   <b>SYNOPSIS</b>
          glance-scrubber [options]

   <b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       glance-scrubber is a utility that allows an operator to configure Glance for the asynchronous deletion of
       images  or to revert the image's status from <u>pending_delete</u> to <u>active</u>.  Whether this makes sense for your
       deployment depends upon the storage backend you are using and the size of typical images handled by  your
       Glance installation.

       An  image  in  glance  is  really a combination of an image record (stored in the database) and a file of
       image data (stored in a storage backend).  Under normal operation, the image-delete call is  synchronous,
       that  is,  Glance  receives  the  DELETE  request,  deletes the image data from the storage backend, then
       deletes the image record from the database, and finally returns a 204 as the result of the call.  If  the
       backend  is  fast  and deletion time is not a function of data size, these operations occur very quickly.
       For backends where deletion time is a function of data size, however, the image-delete operation can take
       a significant amount of time to complete, to the point  where  a  client  may  timeout  waiting  for  the
       response.  This in turn leads to user dissatisfaction.

       To  avoid  this  problem, Glance has a <b>delayed_delete</b> configuration option (False by default) that may be
       set in the <b>glance-api.conf</b> file.  With this option enabled, when Glance receives  a  DELETE  request,  it
       does  <u>only</u>  the  database  part of the request, marking the image's status as <b>pending_delete</b>, and returns
       immediately.  (The <b>pending_delete</b> status is not visible to users; an image-show request for such an image
       will return 404.)  However, it is important to note that when <b>delayed_delete</b> is enabled, <u>Glance</u> <u>does</u>  <u>not</u>
       <u>delete</u> <u>image</u> <u>data</u> <u>from</u> <u>the</u> <u>storage</u> <u>backend</u>.  That's where the glance-scrubber comes in.

       The  glance-scrubber  cleans  up  images  that  have been deleted.  If you run Glance with <b>delayed_delete</b>
       enabled, you <u>must</u> run the glance-scrubber occasionally or your storage backend will  eventually  fill  up
       with "deleted" image data.

       The  glance-scrubber  can  also revert a image to <u>active</u> if operators delete the image by mistake and the
       pending-delete is enabled in Glance. Please make sure the <b>glance-scrubber</b> is not running before restoring
       the image to avoid image data inconsistency.

       Configuration of glance-scrubber is done in the <b>glance-scrubber.conf</b>  file.   Options  are  explained  in
       detail in comments in the sample configuration file, so we only point out a few of them here.

       <b>scrub_time</b>
              minimum time in seconds that an image will stay in <b>pending_delete</b> status (default is 0)

       <b>scrub_pool_size</b>
              configures  a  thread  pool so that scrubbing can be performed in parallel (default is 1, that is,
              serial scrubbing)

       <b>daemon</b> a boolean indicating whether the scrubber should run as a daemon (default is False)

       <b>wakeup_time</b>
              time in seconds between runs when the scrubber is run in daemon mode (ignored if the  scrubber  is
              not being run in daemon mode)

       <b>metadata_encryption_key</b>
              If  your <b>glance-api.conf</b> sets a value for this option (the default is to leave it unset), you must
              include the same setting in your <b>glance-scrubber.conf</b> or the scrubber won't be able  to  determine
              the locations of your image data.

       <b>restore</b>
              reset  the  specified image's status from'pending_delete' to 'active' when the image is deleted by
              mistake.

       <b>[database]</b>
              As of the Queens release of Glance (16.0.0), the  glance-scrubber  does  not  use  the  deprecated
              Glance   registry,   but   instead   contacts   the   Glance   database   directly.    Thus   your
              <b>glance-scrubber.conf</b> file must contain a [database] section specifying the relevant information.

       <b>[glance_store]</b>
              This section of the file contains the configuration information for the storage backends  used  by
              your Glance installation.

       The  usual  situation  is  that  whatever  your <b>glance-api.conf</b> has for the <b>[database]</b> and <b>[glance_store]</b>
       configuration groups should go into your <b>glance-scrubber.conf</b>, too.   Of  course,  if  you  have  heavily
       customized your setup, you know better than we do what you are doing.  The key thing is that the scrubber
       needs  to be able to access the Glance database to determine what images need to be scrubbed (and to mark
       them as deleted once their associated data has been removed from the storage backend), and it  needs  the
       glance_store information so it can delete the image data.

   <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>General</b> <b>options</b>

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Show the help message and exit

       <b>--version</b>
              Print the version number and exit

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Print more verbose output

       <b>--noverbose</b>
              Disable verbose output

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--debug</b>
              Print debugging output (set logging level to DEBUG instead of default WARNING level)

       <b>--nodebug</b>
              Disable debugging output

       <b>--use-syslog</b>
              Use syslog for logging

       <b>--nouse-syslog</b>
              Disable the use of syslog for logging

       <b>--syslog-log-facility</b> <b>SYSLOG_LOG_FACILITY</b>
              syslog facility to receive log lines

       <b>--config-dir</b> <b>DIR</b>
              Path  to  a  config  directory  to  pull  *.conf files from. This file set is sorted, to provide a
              predictable parse order if individual options are over-ridden. The set is parsed after the file(s)
              specified via previous --config-file, arguments hence over-ridden options in  the  directory  take
              precedence.  This  means  that configuration from files in a specified config-dir will always take
              precedence over configuration from files specified by --config-file, regardless to argument order.

       <b>--config-file</b> <b>PATH</b>
              Path to a config file to use. Multiple config files can be specified by using this  flag  multiple
              times,  for  example,  --config-file  &lt;file1&gt;  --config-file  &lt;file2&gt;. Values in latter files take
              precedence.

       <b>--log-config-append</b> <b>PATH</b> <b>--log-config</b> <b>PATH</b>
              The name of logging configuration file. It does not disable existing  loggers,  but  just  appends
              specified  logging  configuration  to  any  other  existing logging options. Please see the Python
              logging module documentation for details on logging configuration files. The log-config  name  for
              this option is deprecated.

       <b>--log-format</b> <b>FORMAT</b>
              A logging.Formatter log message format string which may use any of the available logging.LogRecord
              attributes. Default: None

       <b>--log-date-format</b> <b>DATE_FORMAT</b>
              Format string for %(asctime)s in log records. Default: None

       <b>--log-file</b> <b>PATH,</b> <b>--logfile</b> <b>PATH</b>
              (Optional) Name of log file to output to. If not set, logging will go to stdout.

       <b>--log-dir</b> <b>LOG_DIR,</b> <b>--logdir</b> <b>LOG_DIR</b>
              (Optional) The directory to keep log files in (will be prepended to --log-file)

       <b>-D,</b> <b>--daemon</b>
              Run  as  a long-running process. When not specified (the default) run the scrub operation once and
              then exits.  When specified do not exit and run scrub on wakeup_time interval as specified in  the
              config.

       <b>--nodaemon</b>
              The inverse of --daemon. Runs the scrub operation once and then exits. This is the default.

       <b>--restore</b> <b>&lt;IMAGE_ID&gt;</b>
              Restore the specified image status from 'pending_delete' to 'active'.

   <b>FILES</b>
       <b>/etc/glance/glance-scrubber.conf</b>
              Default configuration file for the Glance Scrubber
