</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       git-annex-preferred-content - which files are wanted in a repository

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Each  repository  has  a  preferred content setting, which specifies content that the repository wants to
       have present. These settings can be configured using <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>vicfg</b> or <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>wanted</b>.  They are  used
       by the <b>--auto</b> option, by <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>sync</b> <b>--content</b>, by clusters, and by the git-annex assistant.

       While  preferred  content expresses a preference, it can be overridden by simply using <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>drop</b>. On
       the other hand, required content settings are enforced; <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>drop</b> will refuse  to  drop  a  file  if
       doing  so  would violate its required content settings. A repository's required content can be configured
       using <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>vicfg</b> or <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>required</b>.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       Preferred content expressions use a similar syntax  to  the  <a href="../man1/git-annex-matching-options.1.html">git-annex-matching-options</a>(1),  without  the
       dashes.  For example:

        exclude=archive/* and (include=*.mp3 or smallerthan=1mb)

       The  idea  is  that  you  write  an  expression  that  files  are matched against. If a file matches, the
       repository wants to store its content. If it doesn't, the repository wants to drop its content (if  there
       are enough copies elsewhere to allow removing it).

</pre><h4><b>EXPRESSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>include=glob</b> / <b>exclude=glob</b>

              Match files to include, or exclude.

              While  the  command-line  options  --include=glob  and  --exclude=glob match files relative to the
              current directory, preferred content expressions match files  relative  to  the  top  of  the  git
              repository.

              A  glob is something like <b>foo.*</b> or <b>b?r</b>.  Globs can also contain character classes, like <b>foo[Bb]ar</b>,
              as well as additional POSIX character classes like <b>[[:space:]]</b>. Which is useful, since a glob in a
              preferred content expression cannot contain spaces. See the <b><a href="../man7/glob.7.html">glob</a>(7)</b> man page for more about globs.

              For example, suppose you put files into <b>archive</b> directories when you're done with them.  Then  you
              could configure your laptop to prefer to not retain those files, like this: <b>exclude=*/archive/*</b>

              When  a  subdirectory  is being exported or imported to a special remote (see <a href="../man1/git-annex-export.1.html">git-annex-export</a>(1))
              and <a href="../man1/git-annex-import.1.html">git-annex-import</a>(1), these match relative to the top of the subdirectory.

              Note that, when a command is run with the <b>--all</b> option, or in  a  bare  repository,  there  is  no
              filename associated with an annexed object, and so "include=" and "exclude=" will not match.

       <b>copies=number</b>
              Matches  only  files that git-annex believes to have the specified number of copies, or more. Note
              that it does not check remotes to verify that the copies still exist.

              To decide if content should be dropped, git-annex evaluates the preferred content expression under
              the assumption that the content has *already* been dropped. If the content  would  not  be  wanted
              then,  the  drop  can  be  done.  So, for example, <b>copies=2</b> in a preferred content expression lets
              content be dropped only when there are currently 3 copies of it, including  the  repo  it's  being
              dropped from. This is different than running git annex drop --copies=2, which will drop files that
              currently have 2 copies.

       <b>copies=trustlevel:number</b>
              Matches  only  files that git-annex believes have the specified number copies, on remotes with the
              specified trust level. For example, <b>copies=trusted:2</b>

              To match any trust level  at  or  higher  than  a  given  level,  use  <b>trustlevel+</b>.  For  example,
              <b>copies=semitrusted+:2</b>

       <b>copies=groupname:number</b>
              Matches  only files that git-annex believes have the specified number of copies, on remotes in the
              specified group. For example, <b>copies=archive:2</b>

              Preferred content expressions have no equivalent to the <b>--in</b> option,  but  groups  can  accomplish
              similar  things.  You  can add repositories to groups, and match against the groups in a preferred
              content expression. So rather than <b>--in=usbdrive</b>, put all the USB drives into a "transfer"  group,
              and use <b>copies=transfer:1</b>

       <b>lackingcopies=number</b>
              Matches  only files that git-annex believes need the specified number or more additional copies to
              be made in order to satisfy their numcopies settings.

       <b>approxlackingcopies=number</b>
              Like lackingcopies, but does not look at .gitattributes annex.numcopies settings.  This  makes  it
              significantly faster.

       <b>inbackend=backendname</b>
              Matches only files whose content is stored using the specified key-value backend.

              See <a href="../man1/git-annex-backends.1.html">git-annex-backends</a>(1) for information about available backends.

       <b>securehash</b>
              Matches only files whose content is hashed using a cryptographically secure function.

       <b>inallgroup=groupname</b>
              Matches only files that git-annex believes are present in all repositories in the specified group.

       <b>onlyingroup=groupname</b>
              Matches  files  that  git-annex  believes  are  present  in at least one repository that is in the
              specified group, and are not present in any repositories that are not in the specified group.

       <b>smallerthan=size</b> / <b>largerthan=size</b>
              Matches only files whose content is smaller than, or larger than the specified size.

              The size can be specified with any commonly used units, for example, "0.5 gb" or "100 KiloBytes"

       <b>metadata=field=glob</b>
              Matches only files that have a metadata field attached with a value that  matches  the  glob.  The
              values of metadata fields are matched case insensitively.

              A  glob is something like <b>foo.*</b> or <b>b?r</b>.  Globs can also contain character classes, like <b>foo[Bb]ar</b>,
              as well as additional POSIX character classes like <b>[[:space:]]</b>. Which is useful, since a glob in a
              preferred content expression cannot contain spaces. See the <b><a href="../man7/glob.7.html">glob</a>(7)</b> man page for more about globs.

              To match a tag "done", use <b>metadata=tag=done</b>

              To match author metadata, use <b>metadata=author=*Smith</b>

       <b>metadata=field&lt;number</b> / <b>metadata=field&gt;number</b>

       <b>metadata=field&lt;=number</b> / <b>metadata=field&gt;=number</b>
              Matches only files that have a metadata field attached with a value that is a number and  is  less
              than or greater than the specified number.

              To  match  PDFs  with  between  100  and 200 pages (assuming something has set that metadata), use
              <b>metadata=pagecount&gt;=100</b> <b>and</b> <b>metadata=pagecount&lt;=200</b>

       <b>present</b>
              Makes content be wanted if it's present, but not otherwise.

              This leaves it up to you to use git-annex manually to move content around. You  can  use  this  to
              avoid   preferred  content  settings  from  affecting  a  subdirectory.  For  example:  <b>auto/*</b>  <b>or</b>
              <b>(include=ad-hoc/*</b> <b>and</b> <b>present)</b>

              Note that <b>not</b> <b>present</b> is not a reasonable thing to put in a preferred content expression. It  says
              to get content that's not present, but then drop it! If that somehow gets into a preferred content
              expression, git-annex will recognize that the preferred content expression is not stable, and make
              it never match.

       <b>inpreferreddir</b>
              Makes content be preferred if it's in a directory (located anywhere in the tree) with a particular
              name.

              The   name   of   the   directory   can   be  configured  using  <b>git</b>  <b>annex</b>  <b>enableremote</b>  <b>$remote</b>
              <b>preferreddir=$dirname</b>

              (If no directory name is configured, it uses "public" by default.)

              Note that, when a command is run with the <b>--all</b> option, or in  a  bare  repository,  there  is  no
              filename associated with an annexed object, and so "inpreferreddir" will not match.

       <b>standard</b>
              git-annex  comes  with  some  built-in  preferred  content  expressions,  that  can  be  used with
              repositories that are in some standard groups such as "client" and "transfer".

              When a repository is in exactly one such  group,  you  can  use  the  "standard"  keyword  in  its
              preferred content expression, to match whatever content the group's expression matches.

              Most  often,  the  whole  preferred content expression is simply "standard".  But, you can do more
              complicated things, for example: <b>standard</b> <b>or</b> <b>include=otherdir/*</b>

       <b>groupwanted</b>
              The "groupwanted" keyword can be  used  to  refer  to  a  preferred  content  expression  that  is
              associated  with  a  group,  as  long  as there is exactly one such expression amoung the groups a
              repository is in. This is like the "standard" keyword, but you can configure the preferred content
              expressions using <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>groupwanted</b>.

              When writing a groupwanted preferred content expression, you can use all the  keywords  documented
              here, including "standard".  (But not "groupwanted".)

              For  example,  to make a variant of the standard client preferred content expression that does not
              want files in the "out" directory, you could run:  <b>git</b>  <b>annex</b>  <b>groupwanted</b>  <b>client</b>  <b>"standard</b>  <b>and</b>
              <b>exclude=out/*"</b>

              Then  repositories that are in the client group and have their preferred content expression set to
              "groupwanted" will use that, while other client repositories that  have  their  preferred  content
              expression set to "standard" will use the standard expression.

              Or,  you  could make a new group, with your own custom preferred content expression tuned for your
              needs, and every repository you put in this group and make its preferred content be  "groupwanted"
              will use it.

              For  example,  the  archive  group  only  wants to archive 1 copy of each file, spread among every
              repository in the group.  Here's how to configure a group  named  redundantarchive,  that  instead
              wants to contain 3 copies of each file:

               git annex groupwanted redundantarchive "not (copies=redundantarchive:3)"
               for repo in foo bar baz; do
                    git annex group $repo redundantarchive
                    git annex wanted $repo groupwanted
               done

       <b>unused</b> Matches only keys that <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>unused</b> has determined to be unused.

              This  is  related  the  the  --unused  option.   However,  putting  <b>unused</b>  in a preferred content
              expression doesn't make git-annex consider those unused keys. So when git-annex is  only  checking
              preferred  content  expressions against files in the repository (which are obviously used), <b>unused</b>
              in a preferred content expression won't match anything.

              So when is <b>unused</b> useful in a preferred content expression?

              Using <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>sync</b> <b>--content</b> <b>--all</b> will operate on all files, including unused  ones,  and  take
              <b>unused</b> in preferred content expressions into account.

              The  git-annex  assistant  periodically  scans for unused files, and moves them to some repository
              whose preferred content expression says it wants them. (Or, if annex.expireunused is set,  it  may
              just delete them.)

       <b>balanced=groupname[:number]</b>
              Makes content be evenly balanced amoung repositories in the group.

              The  number  is  the  number  of  repositories  in  the  group  that will want each file. When not
              specified, the default is 1.

              For example, "balanced=backup:2", when there are 3 members of the backup  group,  will  make  each
              backup repository want 2/3rds of the files.

              For  this  to work, each repository in the group should have its preferred content set to the same
              expression. Using <b>groupwanted</b> is a good way to do that.

              The sizes of files are not taken into account, so it's possible for one repository to  get  larger
              than  usual  files  and  so  fill  up  before the other repositories. But files are only wanted by
              repositories that have enough free space to hold them. So once a repository is full, the remaining
              repositories will have any additional files balanced amoung them. For git-annex  to  know  when  a
              repository  is  full,  you must use <a href="../man1/git-annex-maxsize.1.html">git-annex-maxsize</a>(1) to specify the size of each repository in
              the group.

              This usually avoids moving files between repositories, even if that  means  that  things  are  not
              optimally  balanced.  Some  of  the  ways  that  it  can  get  out of balance include adding a new
              repository to the group, or a file getting copied into more repositories in  the  group  than  the
              specified number, or some of the repositories filling up.

              Running  git-annex  commands  with the <b>--rebalance</b> option will make this expression instead behave
              like the <b>fullybalanced</b> expression, which will make repositories  want  to  move  files  around  as
              necessary in order to get fully balanced.

              Using  this  in  a preferred content expression makes git-annex need to do some additional work to
              keep track of how full repositories are. Usually that won't affect performance much. However,  the
              first  time  git-annex  processes  this  expression  in  a  given  git repository, it will need to
              calculate the sizes of all repositories, which can be slow when there are a  lot  of  files.  When
              this causes git-annex to do a lot of work, it will display "(calculating repository sizes)".

              Note  that  <b>not</b>  <b>balanced</b>  not a reasonable thing to use in a preferred content expression for the
              same reasons as <b>not</b> <b>present</b>.

       <b>fullybalanced=groupname[:number]</b>
              This is like <b>balanced</b>, but allows moving content between repositories in the group at any time  to
              keep it fully balanced.

              Normally  "balanced=groupname:number"  is  the  same  as  "(fullybalanced=groupname:number and not
              copies=groupname:number) or present"

              When the <b>--rebalance</b> option is used, <b>balanced</b> is the same as <b>fullybalanced</b>.

              When the specified number is greater than 1, and too many repositories in the group are more  than
              90% full (as configured by annex.fullybalancedthreshhold), this behaves like <b>fullysizebalanced</b>.

              For  example,  <b>fullybalanced=foo:3</b>,  when group foo has 5 repositories, two 50% full and three 99%
              full, will make some content move from the full repositories to the others.  Moving  content  like
              that  is  expensive,  but  it allows new files to continue to be stored on the specified number of
              repositories.

       <b>sizebalanced=groupname:number</b>
              Distributes content amoung repositories in the group, keeping repositories proportionally full.

              The number is the number of repositories  in  the  group  that  will  want  each  file.  When  not
              specified, the default is 1.

              For  this to work, you must use <a href="../man1/git-annex-maxsize.1.html">git-annex-maxsize</a>(1) to specify the size of each repository in the
              group. When a repository's maxsize has not been specified, it will not want any files.

              For example, if one repository in the group has a maximum size of 100 gb  with  60  gb  used,  and
              another  has a maximum size of 50 gb with 25 gb used, the smaller one will want files (that fit in
              it), and the larger one won't want any files (that would fit in the smaller one) until the smaller
              one gets equally full.

              Note that, once a repository contains a file, it will continue to want it, even if it's more  full
              than other repositories. This is to avoid churn in moving files around.

              This is more likely to get out of balance than the <b>balanced=</b> expression is, because git-annex does
              not  always  have  a  consistent knowledge of how full repositories are. Consider for example if a
              laptop and a desktop are each sending a new file to the  group.  They  will  both  pick  whichever
              repository  was  least  full,  but  that means both files go to the same repository, when a better
              solution might have been to send the smaller file to a different repository. When using  <b>balanced=</b>
              in the same situation, it's less likely that a repository will want both files.

              Running  git-annex  commands  with the <b>--rebalance</b> option will make this expression instead behave
              like the <b>fullysizebalanced</b> expression, which will make repositories want to move files  around  as
              necessary in order to get fully balanced.

              Note that <b>not</b> <b>sizebalanced</b> not a reasonable thing to use in a preferred content expression for the
              same reasons as <b>not</b> <b>present</b>.

       <b>fullysizebalanced=groupname:number</b>
              This is like <b>sizebalanced</b>, but allows moving content between repositories in the group at any time
              to keep it fully balanced.

              Normally  "sizebalanced=groupname:number"  is the same as "(fullysizebalanced=groupname:number and
              not copies=groupname:number) or present"

              When the <b>--rebalance</b> option is used, <b>sizebalanced</b> is the same as <b>fullysizebalanced</b>.

       <b>anything</b>
              Always matches.

       <b>nothing</b>
              Never matches. (Same as "not anything")

       <b>not</b> <b>expression</b>
              Inverts  what  the  expression  matches.  For  example,  <b>not</b>  <b>include=archive/*</b>  is  the  same  as
              <b>exclude=archive/*</b>

       <b>and</b> / <b>or</b> / <b>(</b> <b>expression</b> <b>)</b>
              These can be used to build up more complicated expressions.

</pre><h4><b>TESTING</b></h4><pre>
       To  check  at  the command line which files are matched by a repository's preferred content settings, you
       can use the --want-get and --want-drop options.

       For example, git annex find --want-get --not --in . will find all the files that  git  annex  get  --auto
       will  want  to  get,  and  git  annex find --want-drop --in . will find all the files that git annex drop
       --auto will want to drop.

       The --explain option can be used to understand why a complex  preferred  content  expression  matches  or
       fails  to  match.  The  expression will be displayed, with each term followed by "[TRUE]" or "[FALSE]" to
       indicate the value. Irrelevant terms will be ommitted from the explanation, for  example  <b>"exclude=*</b>  <b>and</b>
       <b>copies=1"</b> will be displayed as <b>"exclude=*[FALSE]"</b>
