</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       git-annex-get - make content of annexed files available

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       git annex get <b>[path</b> <b>...]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Makes  the  content  of annexed files available in this repository. This will involve copying them from a
       remote repository, or downloading them, or transferring them from some kind of key-value store.

       With no parameters, gets all annexed files in  the  current  directory  whose  content  was  not  already
       present. Paths of files or directories to get can be specified.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
        # evince foo.pdf
        error: Unable to open document foo.pdf: No such file or directory
        # ls foo.pdf
        foo.pdf@
        # git annex get foo.pdf
        get foo.pdf (from origin..) ok
        # evince foo.pdf

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--auto</b>

              Rather than getting all the specified files, get only those that don't yet have the desired number
              of copies, or that are preferred content of the repository. See <a href="../man1/git-annex-preferred-content.1.html">git-annex-preferred-content</a>(1)

       <b>--from=remote</b>
              Normally  git-annex  will  choose  which  remotes to get the content from, preferring remotes with
              lower costs. Use this option to specify which remote to use.

              Any files that are not available on the remote will be silently skipped.

       <b>--jobs=N</b> <b>-JN</b>
              Enables parallel download with up to the specified number of jobs running at  once.  For  example:
              <b>-J10</b>

              Setting this to "cpus" will run one job per CPU core.

              When  files  can  be  downloaded from multiple remotes, enabling parallel downloads will split the
              load between the remotes. For example, if the files are available on remotes A  and  B,  then  one
              file  will  be downloaded from A, and another file will be downloaded from B in parallel. (Remotes
              with lower costs are still preferred over higher cost remotes.)

       matching options
              The <a href="../man1/git-annex-matching-options.1.html">git-annex-matching-options</a>(1) can be used to control what to get.

       <b>--incomplete</b>
              Resume any incomplete downloads  of  files  that  were  started  and  interrupted  at  some  point
              previously. Useful to pick up where you left off ... when you don't quite remember where that was.

              These  incomplete  files  are  the  same  ones  that  are  listed  as  unused  temp  files by <a href="../man1/gitannex-unused.1.html">git-</a>
              <a href="../man1/gitannex-unused.1.html">annex-unused</a>(1).

              Note that the git-annex key will be displayed when downloading, as git-annex  does  not  know  the
              associated file, and the associated file may not even be in the current git working directory.

       <b>--all</b> <b>-A</b>
              Rather  than  specifying  a  filename or path to get, this option can be used to get all available
              versions of all files.

              This is the default behavior when running git-annex in a bare repository.

       <b>--branch=ref</b>
              Operate on files in the specified branch or treeish.

       <b>--unused</b>
              Operate on files found by last run of git-annex unused.

       <b>--failed</b>
              Operate on files that have recently failed to be transferred.

              Not to be confused with <b>--incomplete</b> which resumes only downloads that managed to transfer part of
              the content of a file.

       <b>--key=keyname</b>
              Use this option to get a specified key.

       <b>--batch</b>
              Enables batch mode, in which lines containing names of files to get are read from stdin.

              As each specified file is processed, the usual progress output  is  displayed.  If  the  specified
              file's  content  is already present, or it does not match specified matching options, or it is not
              an annexed file, a blank line is output in response instead.

              Since the usual output while getting a file is verbose and not machine-parseable, you may want  to
              use --json in combination with --batch.

       <b>--batch-keys</b>
              This is like <b>--batch</b> but the lines read from stdin are parsed as keys.

       <b>-z</b>     Makes batch input be delimited by nulls instead of the usual newlines.

       <b>--json</b> Enable  JSON  output.  This  is intended to be parsed by programs that use git-annex. Each line of
              output is a JSON object.

       <b>--json-progress</b>
              Include progress objects in JSON output.

       <b>--json-error-messages</b>
              Messages that would normally be output to standard error are included in the JSON instead.

       Also the <a href="../man1/git-annex-common-options.1.html">git-annex-common-options</a>(1) can be used.
