</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Ecatools  are  simple command line utils for audio file processing.  Each tool is designed to perform one
       specific operation. Most of the tools also support batch processing.

       <b>ECACONVERT</b>

       A tool for converting a set of files to a common target format.  This target format is given as the first
       command line argument, and its syntax is <u>.ext</u>.

       <b>ECAFIXDC</b>

       A simple command-line tool for fixing DC-offset.

       <b>ECALENGTH</b>

       See the separate <a href="../man1/ecalength.1.html">ecalength</a>(1) man page.

       <b>ECAMONITOR</b>

       Ecamonitor is a util program that can be used to monitor an active ecasound session. Ecamonitor  is  able
       to  show  information  about  the  current  chainsetup such as list of inputs, outputs, current position,
       effects, the engine status and numerous other things.

       By default ecamonitor will try to connect to IP4  address  "localhost",  to  port  "2868".   A  different
       address  can  be  specified  when  starting  ecamonitor,  for  example  "ecamonitor foo.mynetwork.com" or
       "ecamonitor foo.mynetwork.com:4500".

       To enable inbound connections, ecasound has to  be  started  with  the  <u>--daemon</u>  option.  Ecamonitor  is
       implemented in Python using the NetECI API.

       <b>ECANORMALIZE</b>

       Ecanormalize  is  a  command-line  tool  for normalizing audio files to utilize the full available sample
       resolution. Ecanormalize first finds out how much the input file can be amplified without clipping and if
       there is room for increase, a static gain will be applied to the file.

       <b>ECAPLAY</b>

       Ecaplay is a command-line tool for playing audio files. Ecaplay uses the libecasound engine and  is  thus
       able to handle all audio formats supported by the library.

       Files  can  be  selected for playback either by specifying the filenames on the command-line, or by using
       the playlist mechanism. In playlist mode, files can be added to the playlist using the <u>-q</u> option. The  <u>-p</u>
       option can then be used to play all tracks on the playlist. Ecaplay will repeat the playlist tracks until
       explicitly stopped (with double Ctrl-C).  Playlist can be flushed with <u>-f</u> and its contents listed with <u>-l</u>
       option.

       If  not otherwise specified, ecaplay will use the audio output device specified in <u><a href="file:~/.ecasound/ecasoundrc">~/.ecasound/ecasoundrc</a></u>
       for playback. A different output device can be  selected  with  <u>ECAPLAY_OUTPUT_DEVICE</u>  shell  environment
       variable or with the <u>-o:output_device</u> command-line option.

       Playback can be stopped at any time with Ctrl-C. If multiple files are played, first Ctrl-C will stop the
       current  file  and  move  on  to  play the next one. Issuing Ctrl-C twice (within one second), will cause
       ecaplay to exit.

       -d:debuglevel
              Set libecasound debug level. See <a href="../man1/ecasound.1.html">ecasound</a>(1).

       -f     Flush the playlist contents. See also options <u>-l,</u> <u>-p</u> <u>and</u> <u>-q</u>.

       -h     Print usage information and exit.

       -k:number
              Skip ’number’ of files.

       -l     List the current playlist contents to stdout. See also options <u>-f,</u> <u>-p</u> <u>and</u> <u>-q</u>.

       -o:output_device
              Use ’output_device’ instead of the default output device (as specified in <u><a href="file:~/.ecasound/ecasoundrc">~/.ecasound/ecasoundrc</a></u>).
              Syntax is same as used by "-o" ecasound option (see <a href="../man1/ecasound.1.html">ecasound</a>(1) man page).  This option  overrides
              the <u>ECAPLAY_OUTPUT_DEVICE</u> environment variable (more info below).

       -p     Play tracks in the playlist (in looped mode). See also options <u>-f,</u> <u>-l</u> <u>and</u> <u>-q</u>.

       -q     Queue new tracks to the playlist. All filenames given on the command-line will be added to the the
              playlist.  It  is  possible  to  queue  new  tracks while another instance of ecaplay is using the
              playlist. See also options <u>-f,</u> <u>-l</u> <u>and</u> <u>-p</u>.

              <b>ECASIGNALVIEW</b>

       Ecasignalview is meant for monitoring signal amplitude and peak  statistics.  It  accepts  the  following
       options:

       input  The  first  option not starting with a ’-’ is interpreted as an input string. This can be a device
              or a filename. All formats supported by libecasound are accepted. Defaults to ’/dev/dsp’.

       output Similarly to input, second option not starting with a ’-’ is interpreted as  output.  Defaults  to
              ’null’.

       -b:buffersize
              Buffersize in sample frames. Defaults to 128.

       -c     Enable cumulative mode. Counters are not reset after refresh.  <u>*deprecated*</u>

       -d     Enable debug mode.

       -f:format_string
              Specify default audio format. See <a href="../man1/ecasound.1.html">ecasound</a>(1) for details.

       -r:rate_msec
              Specify screen refresh rate in milliseconds.

       -I     Use linear scale for showing audio sample amplitude.

       -L     Use logarithmic scale for showing audio sample amplitude.

       -G, -B, -M*, -r, -z
              Ecasound options use to modify the engine behaviour, see <a href="../man1/ecasound.1.html">ecasound</a>(1) manpage for details.

              When  ecasignalview  is  running,  the  following  keyboard  commands  can  be used to control the
              operation (requires system support for UNIX terminal interface control):

       spacebar
              Reset statistics (max-peak, avg-amplitude and clipped samples count).

       q or Q or Esc
              Quit ecasignalview.

              It is also possible to reset the max-peak and clipped-samples counters by sending a SIGHUP  signal
              to the process (i.e.  from another console: "killall -v -HUP ecasignalview").

       More   complete  documentation  for  ecasignalview  can  be  found  from  "Ecasound  User’s  Guide"  (see
       ’’<a href="http://nosignal.fi/ecasound">http://nosignal.fi/ecasound</a> -&gt; Documentation’’).
