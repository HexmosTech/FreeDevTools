</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       pdb_chainbows File not found or not readable: '--help'

       Renames chain identifiers sequentially, based on TER records.

       Since  HETATM  records  are  not separated by TER records and usually come together at the end of the PDB
       file, this script will attempt to reassign their chain identifiers based on the changes it made  to  ATOM
       lines. This might lead to bad output in certain corner cases.

   <b>Usage:</b>
              python pdb_chainbows.py &lt;pdb file&gt;

   <b>Example:</b>
              python pdb_chainbows.py 1CTF.pdb

       This  program is part of the `pdb-tools` suite of utilities and should not be distributed isolatedly. The
       `pdb-tools` were  created  to  quickly  manipulate  PDB  files  using  the  terminal,  and  can  be  used
       sequentially,  with  one  tool  streaming  data to another. They are based on old FORTRAN77 code that was
       taking too much effort to maintain and compile. RIP.
