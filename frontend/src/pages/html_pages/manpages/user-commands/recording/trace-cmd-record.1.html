</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       trace-cmd-record - record a trace from the Ftrace Linux internal tracer

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>trace-cmd</b> <b>record</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] [<u>command</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <a href="../man1/trace-cmd.1.html">trace-cmd</a>(1) record command will set up the Ftrace Linux kernel tracer to record the specified
       plugins or events that happen while the <u>command</u> executes. If no command is given, then it will record
       until the user hits Ctrl-C.

       The record command of trace-cmd will set up the Ftrace tracer to start tracing the various events or
       plugins that are given on the command line. It will then create a number of tracing processes (one per
       CPU) that will start recording from the kernel ring buffer straight into temporary files. When the
       command is complete (or Ctrl-C is hit) all the files will be combined into a trace.dat file that can
       later be read (see <a href="../man1/trace-cmd-report.1.html">trace-cmd-report</a>(1)).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-p</b> <u>tracer</u>
           Specify a tracer. Tracers usually do more than just trace an event. Common tracers are: <b>function</b>,
           <b>function_graph</b>, <b>preemptirqsoff</b>, <b>irqsoff</b>, <b>preemptoff</b> and <b>wakeup</b>. A tracer must be supported by the
           running kernel. To see a list of available tracers, see <a href="../man1/trace-cmd-list.1.html">trace-cmd-list</a>(1).

       <b>-e</b> <u>event</u>
           Specify an event to trace. Various static trace points have been added to the Linux kernel. They are
           grouped by subsystem where you can enable all events of a given subsystem or specify specific events
           to be enabled. The <u>event</u> is of the format "subsystem:event-name". You can also just specify the
           subsystem without the <u>:event-name</u> or the event-name without the "subsystem:". Using "-e sched_switch"
           will enable the "sched_switch" event where as, "-e sched" will enable all events under the "sched"
           subsystem.

               The 'event' can also contain glob expressions. That is, "*stat*" will
               select all events (or subsystems) that have the characters "stat" in their
               names.

               The keyword 'all' can be used to enable all events.

       <b>-a</b>
           Every event that is being recorded has its output format file saved in the output file to be able to
           display it later. But if other events are enabled in the trace without trace-cmd’s knowledge, the
           formats of those events will not be recorded and trace-cmd report will not be able to display them.
           If this is the case, then specify the <b>-a</b> option and the format for all events in the system will be
           saved.

       <b>-T</b>
           Enable a stacktrace on each event. For example:

                         &lt;idle&gt;-0     [003] 58549.289091: sched_switch:         kworker/0:1:0 [120] R ==&gt; trace-cmd:2603 [120]
                         &lt;idle&gt;-0     [003] 58549.289092: kernel_stack:         &lt;stack trace&gt;
               =&gt; schedule (ffffffff814b260e)
               =&gt; cpu_idle (ffffffff8100a38c)
               =&gt; start_secondary (ffffffff814ab828)

       <b>--func-stack</b>
           Enable a stack trace on all functions. Note this is only applicable for the "function" plugin tracer,
           and will only take effect if the -l option is used and succeeds in limiting functions. If the
           function tracer is not filtered, and the stack trace is enabled, you can live lock the machine.

       <b>-f</b> <u>filter</u>
           Specify a filter for the previous event. This must come after a <b>-e</b>. This will filter what events get
           recorded based on the content of the event. Filtering is passed to the kernel directly so what
           filtering is allowed may depend on what version of the kernel you have. Basically, it will let you
           use C notation to check if an event should be processed or not.

               ==, &gt;=, &lt;=, &gt;, &lt;, &amp;, |, &amp;&amp; and ||

           The above are usually safe to use to compare fields.

       <b>--no-filter</b>
           Do not filter out the trace-cmd threads. By default, the threads are filtered out to not be traced by
           events. This option will have the trace-cmd threads also be traced.

       <b>-R</b> <u>trigger</u>
           Specify a trigger for the previous event. This must come after a <b>-e</b>. This will add a given trigger to
           the given event. To only enable the trigger and not the event itself, then place the event after the
           <b>-v</b> option.

               See Documentation/trace/events.txt in the Linux kernel source for more
               information on triggers.

       <b>-v</b>
           This will cause all events specified after it on the command line to not be traced. This is useful
           for selecting a subsystem to be traced but to leave out various events. For Example: "-e sched -v -e
           "*stat\*"" will enable all events in the sched subsystem except those that have "stat" in their
           names.

               Note: the *-v* option was taken from the way <a href="../man1/grep.1.html">grep</a>(1) inverts the following
               matches.

       <b>-F</b>
           This will filter only the executable that is given on the command line. If no command is given, then
           it will filter itself (pretty pointless). Using <b>-F</b> will let you trace only events that are caused by
           the given command.

       <b>-P</b> <u>pid</u>
           Similar to <b>-F</b> but lets you specify a process ID to trace.

       <b>-c</b>
           Used with either <b>-F</b> (or <b>-P</b> if kernel supports it) to trace the process' children too.

       <b>--user</b>
           Execute the specified <b>command</b> as given user.

       <b>-C</b> <u>clock</u>
           Set the trace clock to "clock".

               Use <a href="../man1/trace-cmd.1.html">trace-cmd</a>(1) list -C to see what clocks are available.

       <b>-o</b> <u>output-file</u>
           By default, trace-cmd report will create a <u>trace.dat</u> file. You can specify a different file to write
           to with the <b>-o</b> option.

       <b>-l</b> <u>function-name</u>
           This will limit the <u>function</u> and <u>function_graph</u> tracers to only trace the given function name. More
           than one <b>-l</b> may be specified on the command line to trace more than one function. This supports both
           full <a href="../man3/regex.3.html">regex</a>(3) parsing, or basic glob parsing. If the filter has only alphanumeric, <b>_</b>, <u>*</u>, <u>?</u>  and <u>.</u>
           characters, then it will be parsed as a basic glob. to force it to be a regex, prefix the filter with
           <u>^</u> or append it with <u>$</u> and it will then be parsed as a regex.

       <b>-g</b> <u>function-name</u>
           This option is for the function_graph plugin. It will graph the given function. That is, it will only
           trace the function and all functions that it calls. You can have more than one <b>-g</b> on the command
           line.

       <b>-n</b> <u>function-name</u>
           This has the opposite effect of <b>-l</b>. The function given with the <b>-n</b> option will not be traced. This
           takes precedence, that is, if you include the same function for both <b>-n</b> and <b>-l</b>, it will not be
           traced.

       <b>-d</b>
           Some tracer plugins enable the function tracer by default. Like the latency tracers. This option
           prevents the function tracer from being enabled at start up.

       <b>-D</b>
           The option <b>-d</b> will try to use the function-trace option to disable the function tracer (if
           available), otherwise it defaults to the proc file: <a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/ftrace_enabled">/proc/sys/kernel/ftrace_enabled</a>, but will not
           touch it if the function-trace option is available. The <b>-D</b> option will disable both the
           ftrace_enabled proc file as well as the function-trace option if it exists.

               Note, this disable function tracing for all users, which includes users
               outside of ftrace tracers (stack_tracer, perf, etc).

       <b>-O</b> <u>option</u>
           Ftrace has various options that can be enabled or disabled. This allows you to set them. Appending
           the text <u>no</u> to an option disables it. For example: "-O nograph-time" will disable the "graph-time"
           Ftrace option.

       <b>-s</b> <u>interval</u>
           The processes that trace-cmd creates to record from the ring buffer need to wake up to do the
           recording. Setting the <u>interval</u> to zero will cause the processes to wakeup every time new data is
           written into the buffer. But since Ftrace is recording kernel activity, the act of this processes
           going back to sleep may cause new events into the ring buffer which will wake the process back up.
           This will needlessly add extra data into the ring buffer.

               The 'interval' metric is microseconds. The default is set to 1000 (1 ms).
               This is the time each recording process will sleep before waking up to
               record any new data that was written to the ring buffer.

       <b>-r</b> <u>priority</u>
           The priority to run the capture threads at. In a busy system the trace capturing threads may be
           staved and events can be lost. This increases the priority of those threads to the real time (FIFO)
           priority. But use this option with care, it can also change the behaviour of the system being traced.

       <b>-b</b> <u>size</u>
           This sets the ring buffer size to <u>size</u> kilobytes. Because the Ftrace ring buffer is per CPU, this
           size is the size of each per CPU ring buffer inside the kernel. Using "-b 10000" on a machine with 4
           CPUs will make Ftrace have a total buffer size of 40 Megs.

       <b>-B</b> <u>buffer-name</u>
           If the kernel supports multiple buffers, this will add a buffer with the given name. If the buffer
           name already exists, that buffer is just reset and will not be deleted at the end of record
           execution. If the buffer is created, it will be removed at the end of execution (unless the <b>-k</b> is
           set, or <u>start</u> command was used).

               After a buffer name is stated, all events added after that will be
               associated with that buffer. If no buffer is specified, or an event
               is specified before a buffer name, it will be associated with the
               main (toplevel) buffer.

               trace-cmd record -e sched -B block -e block -B time -e timer sleep 1

               The above is will enable all sched events in the main buffer. It will
               then create a 'block' buffer instance and enable all block events within
               that buffer. A 'time' buffer instance is created and all timer events
               will be enabled for that event.

       <b>-m</b> <u>size</u>
           The max size in kilobytes that a per cpu buffer should be. Note, due to rounding to page size, the
           number may not be totally correct. Also, this is performed by switching between two buffers that are
           half the given size thus the output may not be of the given size even if much more was written.

               Use this to prevent running out of diskspace for long runs.

       <b>-M</b> <u>cpumask</u>
           Set the cpumask for to trace. It only affects the last buffer instance given. If supplied before any
           buffer instance, then it affects the main buffer. The value supplied must be a hex number.

               trace-cmd record -p function -M c -B events13 -e all -M 5

               If the -M is left out, then the mask stays the same. To enable all
               CPUs, pass in a value of '-1'.

       <b>-k</b>
           By default, when trace-cmd is finished tracing, it will reset the buffers and disable all the tracing
           that it enabled. This option keeps trace-cmd from disabling the tracer and reseting the buffer. This
           option is useful for debugging trace-cmd.

               Note: usually trace-cmd will set the "tracing_on" file back to what it
               was before it was called. This option will leave that file set to zero.

       <b>-i</b>
           By default, if an event is listed that trace-cmd does not find, it will exit with an error. This
           option will just ignore events that are listed on the command line but are not found on the system.

       <b>-N</b> <u>host:port</u>
           If another machine is running "trace-cmd listen", this option is used to have the data sent to that
           machine with UDP packets. Instead of writing to an output file, the data is sent off to a remote box.
           This is ideal for embedded machines with little storage, or having a single machine that will keep
           all the data in a single repository.

               Note: This option is not supported with latency tracer plugins:
                 wakeup, wakeup_rt, irqsoff, preemptoff and preemptirqsoff

       <b>-V</b> <u>cid:port</u>
           If recording on a guest VM and the host is running <b>trace-cmd</b> <b>listen</b> with the <b>-V</b> option as well, or if
           this is recording on the host, and a guest in running <b>trace-cmd</b> <b>listen</b> with the <b>-V</b> option, then
           connect to the listener (the same as connecting with the <b>-N</b> option via the network). This has the
           same limitations as the <b>-N</b> option above with respect to latency tracer plugins.

       <b>-t</b>
           This option is used with <b>-N</b>, when there’s a need to send the live data with TCP packets instead of
           UDP. Although TCP is not nearly as fast as sending the UDP packets, but it may be needed if the
           network is not that reliable, the amount of data is not that intensive, and a guarantee is needed
           that all traced information is transfered successfully.

       <b>-q</b> | <b>--quiet</b>
           For use with recording an application. Suppresses normal output (except for errors) to allow only the
           application’s output to be displayed.

       <b>--date</b>
           With the <b>--date</b> option, "trace-cmd" will write timestamps into the trace buffer after it has finished
           recording. It will then map the timestamp to gettimeofday which will allow wall time output from the
           timestamps reading the created <u>trace.dat</u> file.

       <b>--max-graph-depth</b> <u>depth</u>
           Set the maximum depth the function_graph tracer will trace into a function. A value of one will only
           show where userspace enters the kernel but not any functions called in the kernel. The default is
           zero, which means no limit.

       <b>--cmdlines-size</b> <u>size</u>
           Set the number of entries the kernel tracing file "saved_cmdlines" can contain. This file is a
           circular buffer which stores the mapping between cmdlines and PIDs. If full, it leads to unresolved
           cmdlines ("&lt;...&gt;") within the trace. The kernel default value is 128.

       <b>--module</b> <u>module</u>
           Filter a module’s name in function tracing. It is equivalent to adding <u>:mod:module</u> after all other
           functions being filtered. If no other function filter is listed, then all modules functions will be
           filtered in the filter.

               '--module snd'  is equivalent to  '-l :mod:snd'

               '--module snd -l "*jack*"' is equivalent to '-l "*jack*:mod:snd"'

               '--module snd -n "*"' is equivalent to '-n :mod:snd'

       <b>--proc-map</b>
           Save the traced process address map into the trace.dat file. The traced processes can be specified
           using the option <b>-P</b>, or as a given <u>command</u>.

       <b>--profile</b>
           With the <b>--profile</b> option, "trace-cmd" will enable tracing that can be used with <a href="../man1/trace-cmd-report.1.html">trace-cmd-report</a>(1)
           --profile option. If a tracer <b>-p</b> is not set, and function graph depth is supported by the kernel,
           then the function_graph tracer will be enabled with a depth of one (only show where userspace enters
           into the kernel). It will also enable various tracepoints with stack tracing such that the report can
           show where tasks have been blocked for the longest time.

               See <a href="../man1/trace-cmd-profile.1.html">trace-cmd-profile</a>(1) for more details and examples.

       <b>-G</b>
           Set interrupt (soft and hard) events as global (associated to CPU instead of tasks). Only works for
           --profile.

       <b>-H</b> <u>event-hooks</u>
           Add custom event matching to connect any two events together. When not used with <b>--profile</b>, it will
           save the parameter and this will be used by trace-cmd report --profile, too. That is:

               trace-cmd record -H hrtimer_expire_entry,hrtimer/hrtimer_expire_exit,hrtimer,sp
               trace-cmd report --profile

               Will profile hrtimer_expire_entry and hrtimer_expire_ext times.

               See <a href="../man1/trace-cmd-profile.1.html">trace-cmd-profile</a>(1) for format.

       <b>-S</b>
           (for --profile only) Only enable the tracer or events speficied on the command line. With this
           option, the function_graph tracer is not enabled, nor are any events (like sched_switch), unless they
           are specifically specified on the command line (i.e. -p function -e sched_switch -e sched_wakeup)

       <b>--temp</b> <u>directory</u>
           When <b>trace-cmd</b> is recording the trace, it records the per CPU data into a separate file for each CPU.
           At the end of the trace, these files are concatenated onto the final trace.dat file. If the final
           file is on a network file system, it may not be appropriate to copy these temp files into the same
           location.  <b>--temp</b> can be used to tell <b>trace-cmd</b> where those temp files should be created.

       <b>--ts-offset</b> <b>offset</b>
           Add an offset for the timestamp in the trace.dat file. This will add a offset option into the
           trace.dat file such that a trace-cmd report will offset all the timestamps of the events by the given
           offset. The offset is in raw units. That is, if the event timestamps are in nanoseconds the offset
           will also be in nanoseconds even if the displayed units are in microseconds.

       <b>--tsync-interval</b>
           Set the loop interval, in ms, for timestamps synchronization with guests: If a negative number is
           specified, timestamps synchronization is disabled If 0 is specified, no loop is performed -
           timestamps offset is calculated only twice," at the beginning and at the end of the trace. Timestamps
           synchronization with guests works only if there is support for VSOCK.\n"

       <b>--tsc2nsec</b>
           Convert the current clock to nanoseconds, using tsc multiplier and shift from the Linux kernel’s perf
           interface. This option does not change the trace clock, just assumes that the tsc multiplier and
           shift are applicable for the selected clock. You may use the "-C tsc2nsec" clock, if not sure what
           clock to select.

       <b>--stderr</b>
           Have output go to stderr instead of stdout, but the output of the command executed will not be
           changed. This is useful if you want to monitor the output of the command being executed, but not see
           the output from trace-cmd.

       <b>--poll</b>
           Waiting for data to be available on the trace ring-buffers may trigger IPIs. This might generate
           unacceptable trace noise when tracing low latency or real time systems. The poll option forces
           trace-cmd to use O_NONBLOCK. Traces are extracted by busy waiting, which will hog the CPUs, so only
           use when really needed.

       <b>--name</b>
           Give a specific name for the current agent being processed. Used after <b>-A</b> to give the guest being
           traced a name. Useful when using the vsocket ID instead of a name of the guest.

       <b>--verbose</b>[=<u>level</u>]
           Set the log level. Supported log levels are "none", "critical", "error", "warning", "info", "debug",
           "all" or their identifiers "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6". Setting the log level to specific value
           enables all logs from that and all previous levels. The level will default to "info" if one is not
           specified.

               Example: enable all critical, error and warning logs

               trace-cmd record --verbose=warning

       <b>--file-version</b>
           Desired version of the output file. Supported versions are 6 or 7.

       <b>--compression</b>
           Compression of the trace output file, one of these strings can be passed:

               'any'  - auto select the best available compression algorithm

               'none' - do not compress the trace file

               'name' - the name of the desired compression algorithms. Available algorithms can be listed with
               trace-cmd list -c

       <b>--proxy</b> <u>vsocket</u>
           Use a vsocket proxy to reach the agent. Acts the same as <b>-A</b> (for an agent) but will send the proxy
           connection to the agent. It is expected to run on a privileged guest that the host is aware of (as
           denoted by the <u>cid</u> in the <b>-P</b> option for the agent).

       The basic way to trace all events:

            # trace-cmd record -e all ls &gt; /dev/null
            # trace-cmd report
                  trace-cmd-13541 [003] 106260.693809: filemap_fault: address=0x128122 offset=0xce
                  trace-cmd-13543 [001] 106260.693809: kmalloc: call_site=81128dd4 ptr=0xffff88003dd83800 bytes_req=768 bytes_alloc=1024 gfp_flags=GFP_KERNEL|GFP_ZERO
                         ls-13545 [002] 106260.693809: kfree: call_site=810a7abb ptr=0x0
                         ls-13545 [002] 106260.693818: sys_exit_write:       0x1

       To use the function tracer with sched switch tracing:

            # trace-cmd record -p function -e sched_switch ls &gt; /dev/null
            # trace-cmd report
                         ls-13587 [002] 106467.860310: function: hrtick_start_fair &lt;-- pick_next_task_fair
                         ls-13587 [002] 106467.860313: sched_switch: prev_comm=trace-cmd prev_pid=13587 prev_prio=120 prev_state=R ==&gt; next_comm=trace-cmd next_pid=13583 next_prio=120
                  trace-cmd-13585 [001] 106467.860314: function: native_set_pte_at &lt;-- __do_fault
                  trace-cmd-13586 [003] 106467.860314: function:             up_read &lt;-- do_page_fault
                         ls-13587 [002] 106467.860317: function:             __phys_addr &lt;-- schedule
                  trace-cmd-13585 [001] 106467.860318: function: _raw_spin_unlock &lt;-- __do_fault
                         ls-13587 [002] 106467.860320: function: native_load_sp0 &lt;-- __switch_to

       Here is a nice way to find what interrupts have the highest latency:
