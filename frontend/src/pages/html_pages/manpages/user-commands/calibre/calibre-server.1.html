       calibre-server - calibre-server

          calibre-server [options] [path to library folder...]

       Start  the  calibre  Content  server.  The calibre Content server exposes your calibre libraries over the
       internet. You can specify the path to the library folders as arguments to <b>calibre-server</b>. If you  do  not
       specify any paths, all the libraries that the main calibre program knows about will be used.

       Whenever  you  pass  arguments  to  <b>calibre-server</b>  that  have  spaces  in them, enclose the arguments in
       quotation marks. For example: "/some path/with spaces"

</pre><h4><b>[OPTIONS]</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--access-log</b>
              Path to the access log file. This log contains information about clients connecting to the  server
              and making requests. By default no access logging is done.

       <b>--ajax-timeout</b>
              Time (in seconds) to wait for a response from the server when making queries.

       <b>--auth-mode</b>
              Choose  the  type of authentication used.     Set the HTTP authentication mode used by the server.
              Set to <b>"</b>basic<b>"</b> if you are putting this server behind an SSL proxy. Otherwise, leave it as  <b>"</b>auto<b>"</b>,
              which will use <b>"</b>basic<b>"</b> if SSL is configured otherwise it will use <b>"</b>digest<b>"</b>.

       <b>--auto-reload</b>
              Automatically  reload  server  when  source  code changes. Useful for development. You should also
              specify a small value for the shutdown timeout.

       <b>--ban-after</b>
              Number of login failures for ban.   The number of login failures after  which  an  IP  address  is
              banned

       <b>--ban-for</b>
              Ban  IP  addresses  that  have  repeated  login  failures.          Temporarily bans access for IP
              addresses that have repeated login failures for the specified number of minutes. Useful to prevent
              attempts at guessing passwords. If set to zero, no banning is done.

       <b>--book-list-mode</b>
              Choose the default book list mode.  Set the default book list mode  that  will  be  used  for  new
              users.  Individual  users  can override the default in their own settings. The default is to use a
              cover grid.

       <b>--compress-min-size</b>
              Minimum size for which responses use data compression (in bytes).

       <b>--custom-list-template</b>
              Path to a JSON file containing a template for the custom book list mode. The easiest way to create
              such a template file is to go to Preferences-&gt; Sharing  over  the  net-&gt;  Book  list  template  in
              calibre, create the template and export it.

       <b>--daemonize</b>
              Run process in background as a daemon (Linux only).

       <b>--displayed-fields</b>
              Restrict  displayed  user-defined fields.     Comma separated list of user-defined metadata fields
              that will be displayed by the Content server in the /opds and /mobile views. If you  specify  this
              option, any fields not in this list will not be displayed. For example: my_rating,my_tags

       <b>--enable-allow-socket-preallocation,</b> <b>--disable-allow-socket-preallocation</b>
              Socket  pre-allocation,  for  example,  with systemd socket activation. By default, this option is
              enabled.

       <b>--enable-auth,</b> <b>--disable-auth</b>
              Password based authentication to access the server.         Normally, the server is  unrestricted,
              allowing  anyone  to  access  it. You can restrict access to predefined users with this option. By
              default, this option is disabled.

       <b>--enable-fallback-to-detected-interface,</b> <b>--disable-fallback-to-detected-interface</b>
              Fallback to auto-detected interface.        If for some reason the server is unable to bind to the
              interface specified in the listen_on option, then it will try to detect an interface that connects
              to the outside world and bind to that. By default, this option is enabled.

       <b>--enable-local-write,</b> <b>--disable-local-write</b>
              Allow un-authenticated local connections to make changes.    Normally,  if  you  do  not  turn  on
              authentication,  the server operates in read-only mode, so as to not allow anonymous users to make
              changes to your calibre libraries. This option allows anybody connecting from the same computer as
              the server is running on to make changes. This is useful if you want to  run  the  server  without
              authentication  but  still  use  calibredb  to  make  changes to your calibre libraries. Note that
              turning on this option means any program running on the computer can make changes to your  calibre
              libraries. By default, this option is disabled.

       <b>--enable-log-not-found,</b> <b>--disable-log-not-found</b>
              Log HTTP 404 (Not Found) requests.  Normally, the server logs all HTTP requests for resources that
              are  not  found. This can generate a lot of log spam, if your server is targeted by bots. Use this
              option to turn it off. By default, this option is enabled.

       <b>--enable-use-bonjour,</b> <b>--disable-use-bonjour</b>
              Advertise OPDS feeds via BonJour.   Advertise the OPDS feeds via the BonJour service, so that OPDS
              based reading apps can detect and connect to the server automatically. By default, this option  is
              enabled.

       <b>--enable-use-sendfile,</b> <b>--disable-use-sendfile</b>
              Zero  copy  file  transfers  for  increased performance.         This will use zero-copy in-kernel
              transfers when sending files over the network,  increasing  performance.  However,  it  can  cause
              corrupted  file  transfers on some broken filesystems. If you experience corrupted file transfers,
              turn it off. By default, this option is enabled.

       <b>--help,</b> <b>-h</b>
              show this help message and exit

       <b>--ignored-fields</b>
              Ignored user-defined metadata fields.       Comma separated list of user-defined  metadata  fields
              that  will  not  be  displayed  by the Content server in the /opds and /mobile views. For example:
              my_rating,my_tags

       <b>--listen-on</b>
              The interface on which to listen for connections.   The default is to listen on all available IPv6
              and IPv4 interfaces. You can change this to, for example, <b>"</b>127.0.0.1<b>"</b>  to  only  listen  for  IPv4
              connections from the local machine, or to <b>"</b>0.0.0.0<b>"</b> to listen to all incoming IPv4 connections.

       <b>--log</b>  Path to log file for server log. This log contains server information and errors, not access logs.
              By default it is written to stdout.

       <b>--manage-users</b>
              Manage  the  database of users allowed to connect to this server. You can use it in automated mode
              by adding a --. See calibre-server <u>--manage-users</u> <b>--</b> help  for  details.  See  also  the  <u>--userdb</u>
              option.

       <b>--max-header-line-size</b>
              Max. size of single HTTP header (in KB).

       <b>--max-job-time</b>
              Maximum time for worker processes.  Maximum amount of time worker processes are allowed to run (in
              minutes). Set to zero for no limit.

       <b>--max-jobs</b>
              Maximum  number  of worker processes.         Worker processes are launched as needed and used for
              large jobs such as preparing a book for viewing, adding books, converting, etc. Normally, the max.
              number of such processes is based on the number of CPU cores. You can control it by this setting.

       <b>--max-log-size</b>
              Max. log file size (in MB).         The maximum size of log files, generated by the  server.  When
              the  log  becomes  larger  than this size, it is automatically rotated. Set to zero to disable log
              rotation.

       <b>--max-opds-items</b>
              Maximum number of books in OPDS feeds.      The maximum number  of  books  that  the  server  will
              return in a single OPDS acquisition feed.

       <b>--max-opds-ungrouped-items</b>
              Maximum  number of ungrouped items in OPDS feeds.    Group items in categories such as author/tags
              by first letter when there are more than this number of items. Set to zero to disable.

       <b>--max-request-body-size</b>
              Max. allowed size for files uploaded to the server (in MB).

       <b>--num-per-page</b>

              browser.

       <b>--pidfile</b>
              Write process PID to the specified file

       <b>--port</b> The port on which to listen for connections.

       <b>--search-the-net-urls</b>
              Path  to  a  JSON  file  containing URLs for the <b>"</b>Search the internet<b>"</b> feature. The easiest way to
              create such a file is to go to Preferences-&gt; Sharing over the net-&gt;Search the internet in calibre,
              create the URLs and export them.

       <b>--shutdown-timeout</b>
              Total time in seconds to wait for clean shutdown.

       <b>--ssl-certfile</b>
              Path to the SSL certificate file.

       <b>--timeout</b>
              Time (in seconds) after which an idle connection is closed.

       <b>--trusted-ips</b>
              Allow un-authenticated connections from specific IP addresses to make changes.       Normally,  if
              you  do  not  turn  on  authentication,  the server operates in read-only mode, so as to not allow
              anonymous users to make changes to your calibre libraries. This option allows  anybody  connecting
              from  the  specified  IP  addresses  to make changes. Must be a comma separated list of address or
              network specifications. This is useful if you want to run the server  without  authentication  but
              still  use  calibredb  to make changes to your calibre libraries. Note that turning on this option
              means anyone connecting from  the  specified  IP  addresses  can  make  changes  to  your  calibre
              libraries.

       <b>--url-prefix</b>
              A  prefix to prepend to all URLs.    Useful if you wish to run this server behind a reverse proxy.
              For example use, /calibre as the URL prefix.

       <b>--userdb</b>
              Path to the user database to use for authentication. The database is a SQLite file. To  create  it
              use     <u>--manage-users</u>.     You     can     read    more    about    managing    users    at:    ‐
