       xss-lock - use external locker as X screen saver

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       xss-lock [-n <u>notify_cmd</u>] [-s <u>session</u> <u>ID</u>] [--ignore-sleep] [-l] [-v|-q] [--] <u>locker</u> [<u>arg</u>] ...
       xss-lock --help|--version

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xss-lock</b>  hooks  up  your  favorite  locker to the MIT screen saver extension for X and also to systemd's
       login manager.

       <b>xss-lock</b> should be run in your xsession either by starting it in your <u>.xsessionrc</u>  or  by  other  session
       specific  means  (e.g.  Window  manager  configuration).  Note that <b>xss-lock</b> runs in the foreground (i.e.
       doesn't fork) and therefore you may need to run it in the background (for example by running with <u>&amp;</u>).

       The locker is executed in response to events from these two sources:

       • X signals when screen saver activation is forced or after a period of user inactivity (as set with <b>xset</b>
         <b>s</b> <b>TIMEOUT</b>). In the latter case, the notifier command, if specified, is executed first.

       • The login manager can also request that the session be locked; as a result of  <b>loginctl</b>  <b>lock-sessions</b>,
         for example. Additionally, <b>xss-lock</b> uses the inhibition logic to lock the screen before the system goes
         to sleep.

       <b>xss-lock</b>  waits for the locker to exit -- or kills it when screen saver deactivation or session unlocking
       is forced -- so the command should not fork.

       Also, <b>xss-lock</b> manages the idle hint on the login session. The idle state  of  the  session  is  directly
       linked  to user activity as reported by X (except when the notifier runs before locking the screen). When
       all sessions are idle, the login manager can  take  action  (such  as  suspending  the  system)  after  a
       preconfigured delay.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-n</b> <u>cmd</u>, <b>--notifier=</b><u>cmd</u>
              Run  <u>cmd</u>  when  the  screen  saver  activates  because  of user inactivity. Shell-style quoting is
              supported. The notifier is killed with the signal SIGHUP when X  signals  user  activity  or  with
              signal  SIGTERM  when  the  locker  is started. The locker is started after the first screen saver
              cycle, as set with <b>xset</b> <b>s</b> <b>TIMEOUT</b> <b>CYCLE</b>. If the screen saver cycle time is 0, the notifier is  not
              run and the locker is started immediately after timeout.

              This can be used to run a countdown or (on laptops) dim the screen before locking. For an example,
              see the script <u>/usr/share/doc/xss-lock/dim-screen.sh</u>.

              For  an  example on how to use the two different signals received by the notifier command, see the
              script <u>/usr/share/doc/xss-lock/dim-screen2.sh</u>.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--transfer-sleep-lock</b>
              Allow the locker process to inherit the file descriptor that represents the  delay  lock  obtained
              from the login manager. The corresponding index will be made available in the environment variable
              <b>$XSS_SLEEP_LOCK_FD</b>;  this  will  only  be  set  if  the  reason  for locking is that the system is
              preparing to go to sleep. The locker should close this file descriptor to indicate it is ready.

              Example     scripts      that      wrap      existing      lockers      are      available      as
              <u>/usr/share/doc/xss-lock/transfer-sleep-lock-*.sh</u>.

       <b>-s</b> <u>ID</u>, <b>--session=</b><u>ID</u>
              Use the session <b>ID</b> instead of the current session.

              Example: <u>/usr/share/doc/xss-lock/xss-lock.service</u>.

       <b>--ignore-sleep</b>
              Do not lock on suspend/hibernate.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
              Output only fatal errors.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Output more messages.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print help message and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
              Print version number and exit.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SIGHUP</b> Upon  receiving  this  signal,  <b>xss-lock</b>  resets  the  screen saver, but only if the screen is not
              currently locked (unlike <b>xset</b> <b>s</b> <b>reset</b>).

              This can be used in MPlayer's configuration as a workaround for MPlayer's failure to  restart  the
              screen saver timer when playback is paused:

                 heartbeat-cmd="killall -HUP xss-lock"
                 stop-xscreensaver=false

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This  is ineffective with mplayer2 (and mpv), because its heart keeps beating while playback is
                 paused.

       <b>SIGINT/SIGTERM</b>
              Upon receiving this signal, <b>xss-lock</b> exits after killing any running notifier or locker.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       • Some applications rely on the <b>xdg-screensaver</b> script from xdg-utils, which uses <b>xset</b> <b>s</b> <b>off</b> and  <b>xset</b>  <b>s</b>
         <b>default</b>  to  suspend and resume the screen saver, respectively. The latter resets the timeout and cycle
         to the server defaults (<b>xset</b> <b>s</b> <b>on</b> uses a hardcoded default instead), so this  only  works  if  you  are
         happy with (or can control) the server settings.

         To  fix  the  resume action in this script (or a copy in <u><a href="file:~/bin">~/bin</a></u> preceding the original in <b>$PATH</b>), either
         replace <b>on</b> by your preferred timeout and cycle, or avoid hardcoded time values by patching  the  script
         to     run     a     suspend     loop    as    it    does    for    other    screen    savers,    using
         <u>/usr/share/doc/xss-lock/xdg-screensaver.patch</u>.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       • Use with <b>xscreensaver</b> via <u>.xsessionrc</u> (hence in the background):

            xscreensaver &amp;
            xss-lock -- xscreensaver-command --lock &amp;

       • Run <b>xlock</b> after ten minutes of inactivity:

            xset s 600
            xss-lock xlock +resetsaver

         Without <b>+resetsaver</b>, <b>xlock</b> forces a screen saver reset during  startup,  thereby  telling  <b>xss-lock</b>  to
         immediately kill <b>xlock</b> again.

       • Dim the screen after three minutes of inactivity, lock the screen two minutes later using <b>i3lock</b>:

            xset s 180 120
            xss-lock -n dim-screen.sh -- i3lock -n

         <b>NOTE:</b>
            A script is provided to use <b>i3lock</b>'s forking mode with the <b>--transfer-sleep-lock</b> option (see above).
