</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       alien - Convert or install an alien binary package

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        alien [--to-deb] [--to-rpm] [--to-tgz] [--to-slp] [options] file [...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>alien</b> is a program that converts between Red Hat rpm, Debian deb, Stampede slp, Slackware tgz, and
       Solaris pkg file formats. If you want to use a package from another linux distribution than the one you
       have installed on your system, you can use <b>alien</b> to convert it to your preferred package format and
       install it. It also supports LSB packages.

</pre><h4><b>WARNING</b></h4><pre>
       <b>alien</b> should not be used to replace important system packages, like init, libc, or other things that are
       essential for the functioning of your system. Many of these packages are set up differently by the
       different distributions, and packages from the different distributions cannot be used interchangeably. In
       general, if you can't remove a package without breaking your system, don't try to replace it with an
       alien version.

</pre><h4><b>PACKAGE</b> <b>FORMAT</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       rpm For converting to and from rpm format the Red Hat Package Manager must be installed.

       lsb Unlike  the  other  package  formats,  <b>alien</b>  can  handle  the  dependencies  of  lsb packages if the
           destination package format supports dependencies. Note that this means  that  the  package  generated
           from a lsb package will depend on a package named "lsb" -- your distribution should provide a package
           by  that name, if it is lsb compliant. The scripts in the lsb package will be converted by default as
           well.

           To generate lsb packages, the Red Hat Package Manager must  be  installed,  and  <b>alien</b>  will  use  by
           preference  a  program  named  lsb-rpm,  if it exists.  No guarantees are made that the generated lsb
           packages will be fully LSB compliant, and it's rather unlikely they will unless you build them in the
           lsbdev environment.

           Note that unlike other package formats, converting an LSB package to another format  will  not  cause
           its minor version number to be changed.

       deb For  converting  to  (but not from) deb format, the gcc, make, debhelper, dpkg-dev, and dpkg packages
           must be installed.

       tgz Note that when converting from the tgz format, <b>alien</b> will simply generate an output package that  has
           the  same  files  in  it as are in the tgz file. This only works well if the tgz file has precompiled
           binaries in it in a standard linux directory tree. Do NOT run <b>alien</b> on tar files with source code  in
           them,  unless  you  want this source code to be installed in your root directory when you install the
           package!

           When using <b>alien</b> to convert a tgz package, all files in <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>  in  are  assumed  to  be  configuration
           files.

       pkg To  manipulate packages in the Solaris pkg format (which is really the SV datastream package format),
           you will need the Solaris pkginfo and pkgtrans tools.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>alien</b> will convert all the files you pass into it into all the output types you  specify.  If  no  output
       type is specified, it defaults to converting to deb format.

       file [...]
           The list of package files to convert.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--to-deb</b>
           Make debian packages. This is the default.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--to-rpm</b>
           Make rpm packages.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--to-tgz</b>
           Make tgz packages.

       <b>--to-slp</b>
           Make slp packages.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--to-pkg</b>
           Make Solaris pkg packages.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--install</b>
           Automatically  install  each  generated  package,  and  remove  the  package  file  after it has been
           installed.

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--generate</b>
           Generate a temporary directory suitable for building a package from, but do not actually  create  the
           package.  This  is  useful  if  you  want to move files around in the package before building it. The
           package can be built from this temporary directory by running  "debian/rules  binary",  if  you  were
           creating a Debian package, or by running "rpmbuild -bb &lt;packagename&gt;.spec" if you were creating a Red
           Hat package.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--single</b>
           Like  <b>-g</b>,  but  do not generate the packagename.orig directory. This is only useful when you are very
           low on disk space and are generating a debian package.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--scripts</b>
           Try to convert the scripts that are meant to be run when the package is installed  and  removed.  Use
           this  with  caution, because these scripts might be designed to work on a system unlike your own, and
           could cause problems. It is recommended that you examine the scripts by hand and check  to  see  what
           they do before using this option.

           This is enabled by default when converting from lsb packages.

       <b>--patch=</b><u>patch</u>
           Specify  the  patch  to be used instead of automatically looking the patch up in <b>/var/lib/alien</b>. This
           has no effect unless a debian package is being built.

       <b>--anypatch</b>
           Be less strict about which patch file is used, perhaps attempting to use a patch file  for  an  older
           version of the package. This is not guaranteed to always work; older patches may not necessarily work
           with newer packages.

       <b>--nopatch</b>
           Do not use any patch files.

       <b>--description=</b><u>desc</u>
           Specify  a  description for the package. This only has an effect when converting from the tgz package
           format, which lacks descriptions.

       <b>--version=</b><u>version</u>
           Specify a version for the package. This only has an effect  when  converting  from  the  tgz  package
           format, which may lack version information.

           Note that without an argument, this displays the version of <b>alien</b> instead.

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--test</b>
           Test  the generated packages. Currently this is only supported for debian packages, which, if lintian
           is installed, will be tested with lintian and lintian's output displayed.

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--keep-version</b>
           By default, <b>alien</b> adds one to the minor version number of each package it converts. If this option is
           given, <b>alien</b> will not do this.

       <b>--bump=</b><u>number</u>
           Instead of incrementing the version number of the converted package by 1, increment it by  the  given
           number.

       <b>--fixperms</b>
           Sanitize  all  file  owners  and  permissions when building a deb. This may be useful if the original
           package is a mess. On the other hand, it may break some things to mess  with  their  permissions  and
           owners  to  the  degree  this  does,  so it defaults to off. This can only be used when converting to
           debian packages.

       <b>--target=</b><u>architecture</u>
           Force the architecture of the generated package to the given string.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Be verbose: Display each command <b>alien</b> runs in the process of converting a package.

       <b>--veryverbose</b>
           Be verbose as with --verbose, but also display the output of each  command  run.  Some  commands  may
           generate a lot of output.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Display a short usage summary.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
           Display the version of <b>alien</b>.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Here are some examples of the use of <b>alien</b>:

       alien --to-deb package.rpm
           Convert the package.rpm into a package.deb

       alien --to-rpm package.deb
           Convert the package.deb into a package.rpm

       alien -i package.rpm
           Convert  the package.rpm into a package.deb (converting to a .deb package is default, so you need not
           specify --to-deb), and install the generated package.

       alien --to-deb --to-rpm --to-tgz --to-slp foo.deb bar.rpm baz.tgz
           Creates 9 new packages. When it is done, foo bar and baz are available in all 4 package formats.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>alien</b> recognizes the following environment variables:

       RPMBUILDOPT
           Options to pass to rpm when it is building a package.

       RPMINSTALLOPT
           Options to pass to rpm when it is installing a package.

       EMAIL
           If set, <b>alien</b> assumes this is your email address. Email addresses are included  in  generated  debian
           packages.
