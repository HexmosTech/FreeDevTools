</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       K2pdfopt - PDF Reflow tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>k2pdfopt</b> [<u>opts</u>] <u>&lt;input</u> <u>pdf/djvu</u> <u>|</u> <u>folder&gt;</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>K2pdfopt</b>  attempts to optimize PDF (or DJVU) files (especially two-column ones) for display on the Kindle
       (or other mobile readers/smartphones) by looking for rectangular regions in the  file  and  re-paginating
       them without margins and excess white space.  Works on any PDF or DJVU (.djvu) file, but assumes it has a
       mostly-white background.  Native PDF files (not scanned) work best.

       If  given  a  folder, <b>k2pdfopt</b> first looks for bitmaps in the folder and if any are found, converts those
       bitmaps to a PDF as if they were pages of a PDF file.  If there are no bitmaps in the folder and  if  PDF
       files are in the folder, then each PDF file will be converted in sequence.

       Output  files  are  always  .pdf  and  have  _k2opt added to the source name by default (see <b>-o</b> option to
       specify alternate output name.)

</pre><h4><b>Environment</b> <b>variable</b></h4><pre>
       You can supply command-line options via the environment variable <b>K2PDFOPT</b>, for example,

              set K2PDFOPT=-ui- -x -j 0 -m 0.25

       Command line options from the command line take precedence over the  ones  in  the  environment  variable
       <b>K2PDFOPT</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       You  may  not  have to read this manual - run <b>k2pdfopt</b> without any option and use the interactive menu to
       select desired options.

       <b>-?[-]</b> [<u>pattern</u>]
              Show [don't show] usage only (no file processing).

              If pattern is specified, only options with text matching the pattern are shown.  The  pattern  can
              use  *  as  a  wild  card,  e.g.  <b>-?</b>  <b>-col</b>.   Use <b>-?-</b> to turn off usage.  Combine with <b>-ui-</b> to get
              something you can redirect to a file.

       <b>-a[-]</b>  Turn on [off] text coloring (use of ANSI color codes) on the screen output.  Default is on.

       <b>-ac[-]</b> [<u>&lt;aggressiveness&gt;</u>]
              Auto crop.  For books or papers that have dark edges due to copying artifacts,  this  option  will
              attempt  to  automatically  crop out those dark regions so that k2pdfopt can correctly process the
              source file.  The <u>&lt;aggressiveness&gt;</u> factor is from 0 to 1.  Higher is more aggressive cropping.

              Default if not specified is 0.1.  See also <b>-m</b>.

              Default value is off (<b>-ac-</b>).

              Note that autocropping does not work on cropped  regions  created  with  <b>-cbox</b>.   See  <b>-dw</b>  for  a
              discussion about this.

       <b>-as[-]</b> [<u>&lt;maxdeg&gt;</u>]
              Attempt to automatically straighten tilted source pages.

              Will rotate up to +/-<u>&lt;maxdegrees&gt;</u> degrees if a value is specified, otherwise defaults to 4 degrees
              max.  Use -1 to turn off. Default is off (<b>-as</b> -1 or <b>-as-</b>).  Note that autostraighten does not work
              on cropped regions.

              See <b>-dw</b> for a discussion about this.

       <b>-author</b> <u>&lt;author&gt;</u>
              Set  the author metadata / property of the PDF output file(s). Default is to use the author of the
              source document (<b>-author</b> "").

       <b>-bmp[-]</b> <u>&lt;pageno&gt;</u>
              Generate [do not generate] a bitmap rendering of converted page number &lt;pageno&gt; and  write  it  to
              file  k2pdfopt_out.png.   If  this  option  is used, no other files are written, i.e. the complete
              conversion is NOT done--ONLY the bitmap file is written.  If  <b>-sm</b>  is  also  specified,  then  the
              bitmap  is  of marked source page <u>&lt;pageno&gt;</u>.  If <b>-bmp-</b>, then <u>&lt;pageno&gt;</u> is not necessary.  Default is
              <b>-bmp-</b>.

       <b>-bp[+|-|--]</b> [m|<u>&lt;inches&gt;</u>]
              Break [do not break] output pages at end of each input page.

              Default is <b>-bp-</b>.  If a numeric value is put after <b>-bp</b>, then rather than breaking the  output  page
              at  the  end  of each input page, a gap is inserted of that many inches, e.g.  <b>-bp</b> 1 will insert a
              1-inch gap between contents of each input page.  Special option <b>-bp+</b> will break the pages  at  the
              green boundaries between region as marked by the <b>-sm</b> option (see <b>-sm</b>).  If bookmark information is
              available and <b>-toc</b> is specified (on by default) page breaks will be inserted in the converted file
              at  each  bookmark  unless  <b>-bp--</b>  is  specified.   If  "<b>-bp</b> <b>m</b>" is specified, then a page break is
              inserted after each major (red-box)  section.   This  can  help  prevent  text  selection  overlap
              problems in native output mode.  See also <b>-toc</b>, <b>-bpl</b>.

       <b>-bpc</b> <u>&lt;nn&gt;</u>
              Set  the  bits per color plane on the output device to <u>&lt;nn&gt;</u>.  The value of <u>&lt;nn&gt;</u> can be 1, 2, 4, or
              8.  The default is 4 to match the kindle's display capability.  This is ignored if the <b>-jpg</b> option
              is specified.

       <b>-bpl</b> <u>&lt;srcpagelist&gt;</u>
              Insert page break in destination file before each source file page listed in <u>&lt;srcpagelist&gt;</u>.   This
              has the same format as the <b>-p</b> option.  See also <b>-p</b>, <b>-bp</b>, <b>-toc</b>, <b>-toclist</b>.  Default is no page list.
              Example:  <b>-bpl</b> 10,25,50,70,93,117,143.

              This automatically sets <b>-bp</b> to it's default value (<b>-bp-</b>).

       <b>-bpm[</b><u>&lt;type&gt;</u><b>]</b> <u>&lt;color&gt;</u>
              Set a page break mark type and color.  This option allows you to put colored marks in the PDF file
              to specify where to break pages or where to avoid page breaks.  <u>&lt;type&gt;</u> is either 1 to force a page
              break  or  2  to  prevent a page break until next mark.  <u>&lt;color&gt;</u> is an R,G,B triplet, 0-1 for each
              color component, no spaces.  For example, to break the page wherever the source file has  a  green
              dot  or  short  green  horizontal line:  <b>-bpm1</b> 0,1,0.  Use <u>&lt;color&gt;</u> = -1 to clear.  If you omit the
              <u>&lt;type&gt;</u>, 1 is assumed.

       <b>-c[-]</b>  Output in color [grayscale].  Default is grayscale.

       <b>-cbox[</b><u>&lt;pagelist&gt;</u><b>|u|-]</b> <u>&lt;cropbox&gt;</u>
              Similar to the <b>-grid</b> option, but allows you to specify exact crop boxes from the source page which
              will then be processed as major (red-box) regions.   These  regions  can  then  become  individual
              output pages or can be processed further (searched for columns, re-flowed, etc.) depending on what
              other  options  are  selected.   By  default,  they  are processed further, like every other major
              region.

              You may specify the <b>-cbox</b> option multiple times to crop out different parts of each  source  page,
              each crop being treated as a major region.  See the <b>-mode</b> command.  To have each crop box become a
              new page in the output file, for example, use <b>-mode</b> crop, e.g.

                     k2pdfopt myfile.pdf -mode crop -cbox 2in,3in

              <u>&lt;cropbox&gt;</u>  has  the  format  <u>&lt;left&gt;</u>,<u>&lt;top&gt;</u>,<u>&lt;width&gt;</u>,<u>&lt;height&gt;</u> where all values are specified from the
              upper-left corner of the source page, with units, like the <b>-w</b> and  <b>-h</b>  options,  except  that  the
              default  units  for  <b>-cbox</b>  are  inches.  If only <u>&lt;left&gt;</u> and <u>&lt;top&gt;</u> are specified, then <u>&lt;width&gt;</u> and
              <u>&lt;height&gt;</u> extend to the edge of the page.

              Example:
              <b>-cbox</b> 1in,1in,6in,9in
              (same as <b>-cbox</b> 1,1,6,9).

                     This specifies a crop box that is 6 x 9 inches and which has an upper left corner which  is
                     1 inch from the left and top of the source page.

              Use  <b>-cbox-</b>  to clear all cropboxes, which defaults back to processing every page without any crop
              boxes.

              You can use a page list, <u>&lt;pagelist&gt;</u>, to specify on which pages to apply the cropboxes.

              Examples:

                     <b>-cbox</b>5-51o
                            applies the cropbox on pages 5,7,9,...,51.

                            ('o' = odd.  Use 'e' for even.)

                     <b>-cbox</b>1,2-5,13,15
                            applies the cropbox on pages 1,2,3,4,5,13, and 15.

                     <b>-cbox</b>c <u>&lt;cropbox&gt;</u>
                            applies <u>&lt;cropbox&gt;</u> to the cover image.

                            (see <b>-ci</b> option.)

              Be sure not to put a space between <b>-cbox</b> and the page list.

              Use <b>-cboxu</b> to set a crop box for all unspecified pages.

              E.g. <b>-cbox1-10</b> <u>&lt;cbox1&gt;</u> <b>-cboxu</b> <u>&lt;cbox2&gt;</u> will apply <u>&lt;cbox1&gt;</u> to all pages 1 to 10 and <u>&lt;cbox2&gt;</u>  to  all
              other pages.

              The default is no crop boxes (<b>-cbox-</b>).  See also <b>-m</b>, <b>-ac</b>.

              USAGE  NOTE:   Once  you specify <b>-cbox</b> at least one time, only the crop boxes you specify (and any
              associated page ranges) are processed/converted by  k2pdfopt.   No  other  pages  or  regions  are
              processed.   So if you want to specify a special cropbox for the first page, for example, but then
              have all remaining pages treated entirely, you must specify this:

                     <b>-cbox1</b> ... <b>-cboxu</b> 0,0

                     (<b>-cboxu</b> 0,0 applies a full-page cropbox to all other
                       pages.  u = unspecified.)

              The <b>-cbox2-</b> 0,0 will set the cropbox for pages 2 and beyond to the full page size.

              See also:  <b>-ibox</b>.

       <b>-cg</b> <u>&lt;inches&gt;</u>
              Minimum column gap width in inches for detecting multiple columns.  Default = 0.1 inches.  Setting
              this too large will give very poor results for multicolumn files.  See also <b>-cgmax</b>.

       <b>-cgmax</b> <u>&lt;inches&gt;</u>
              Max allowed gap between columns in inches.  If the gap between two  regions  exceeds  this  value,
              they  will  not be considered as separate columns.  Default = 1.5.  Use -1 for no limit (disable).
              See also <b>-cg</b>.

       <b>-cgr</b> <u>&lt;range&gt;</u>
              Set column-gap range, 0 - 1.  This is the horizontal range over which k2pdfopt will search  for  a
              column  gap,  as a fraction of the page width.  E.g. <b>-cgr</b> 0.5 will search from 0.25 to 0.75 of the
              page width for a column gap.

              Set this to a small value, e.g. 0.05, to only search for column breaks in the middle of the  page.
              Default = 0.33.

       <b>-ch</b> <u>&lt;inches&gt;</u>
              Minimum column height in inches for detecting multiple columns.  Default = 1.5 inches.

       <b>-ci[-]</b> <u>&lt;imagefile&gt;</u>
              Specify  a  cover image for the first page of the converted PDF.  <u>&lt;imagefile&gt;</u> can be a bitmap file
              (png or jpg) or can be a page  from  a  PDF  file,  e.g.  myfile.pdf[34]  would  use  page  34  of
              myfile.pdf.   You can just specify an integer, e.g. <b>-ci</b> 50 to use page 50 of the source file being
              converted as the cover page.  Default is <b>-ci-</b>, which is no cover image.

              NOTE:  <b>-ci</b> only works with bitmapped output--it does not (yet) work with native PDF output.

       <b>-cmax</b> <u>&lt;max&gt;</u>
              Set max contrast increase on source pages.   1.0  keeps  contrast  from  being  adjusted.   Use  a
              negative value to specify a fixed contrast adjustment.  Def = 2.0.

              See also <b>-er</b>.

       <b>-col</b> <u>&lt;maxcol&gt;</u>
              Set  max  number  of  columns.   <u>&lt;maxcol&gt;</u>  can be 1, 2, or 4.  Default is <b>-col</b> 2.  <b>-col</b> 1 disables
              column searching.

       <b>-colorbg</b> (or <b>-colorfg</b>) <u>&lt;hexcolor&gt;</u>|<u>&lt;bitmap&gt;</u>[,<u>&lt;hexcolor&gt;</u>|<u>&lt;bitmap&gt;</u>[,...]]
              Map the color white (background color, for <b>-colorbg</b>) or the color black (text color, for <b>-colorfg</b>)
              to <u>&lt;hexcolor&gt;</u>, where <u>&lt;hexcolor&gt;</u> is a 6-digit hex RRGGBB representation of a color, e.g. ffffff for
              all white, 000000 for all black, ff0000 for bright red, etc.  If <u>&lt;hexcolor&gt;</u>  is  not  a  grayscale
              color,  the <b>-c</b> (color output) option will be turned on automatically.  This option only works with
              bitmapped output (not native--see <b>-n</b>).  Grayscale colors between black and white will be  linearly
              interpolated  between  the  specified  <b>-colorbg</b>  and  <b>-colorfg</b> colors.  If the source document has
              colors, only (mostly) grayscale pixels are affected if ! is put before the  color,  e.g.  <b>-colorbg</b>
              !ffffd0

              A  bitmap can also be specified, e.g. <b>-colorbg</b> myfile.jpg.  In this case, the bitmap gets tiled in
              as the background.

              If you specify a comma delimited list of colors (or bitmaps), then consecutive rows  of  text  are
              colored  with  the  consecutive colors.  This is a possible way to make the rows of text easier to
              follow, e.g. <b>-colorfg</b> ff0000,00 will color alternate rows of text red and black.

              Default is <b>-colorbg</b> "" and <b>-colorfg</b> "" (no mappings).

       <b>-comax</b> <u>&lt;range&gt;</u>
              Stands for Column Offset Maximum.  The <u>&lt;range&gt;</u> given is as a fraction of the  width  of  a  single
              column,  and  it  specifies how much the column divider can move around and still have the columns
              considered contiguous.  Set to -1 to revert back to how columns were treated in k2pdfopt v1.34 and
              before.

              Default = 0.3.

       <b>-crgh</b> <u>&lt;inches&gt;</u>
              Set the min height of the blank area that separates regions with different numbers of columns.

              Default = 1/72 inch.

       <b>-d[-]</b>  Turn on [off] dithering for bpc values &lt; 8.  See <b>-bpc</b>.

              Default is on.

       <b>-de</b> <u>&lt;size&gt;</u>
              Defect size in points.  For scanned documents, marks or defects smaller than this size are ignored
              when bounding rectangular regions.  The period at the end of a sentence is typically over 1  point
              in size.  The default is 1.0.

       <b>-dev</b> <u>&lt;name&gt;</u>
              Select  device  profile  (sets  width,  height,  dpi,  and  corner  marking for selected devices).
              Currently the selection is limited.  <u>&lt;name&gt;</u> just has to have enough characters  to  uniquely  pick
              the device.  Use <b>-dev</b> ? to list the devices.

              Default is <b>-dev</b> kindle2.

       <b>-dpi</b> <u>&lt;dpival&gt;</u>
              Same as <b>-odpi</b>.

       <b>-dr</b> <u>&lt;value&gt;</u>
              Display  resolution  multiplier.   Default = 1.0.  Using a value greater than 1 should improve the
              resolution of the output file (but will make it larger in file size).

              E.g. <b>-dr</b> 2 will double the output DPI, the device width (in pixels), and  the  device  height  (in
              pixels).

       <b>-ds</b> <u>&lt;factor&gt;</u>
              Override the document size with a scale factor.  E.g. if your PDF reader says the PDF file is 17 x
              22 inches and it should actually be 8.5 x 11 inches, use <b>-ds</b> 0.5.  Default is 1.0.

       <b>-dw[-]</b> [<u>&lt;fitorder&gt;</u>]
              De-warp  [do  not  de-warp] pages (uses Leptonica de-warp algorithms).  Default is not to de-warp.
              Does not work for native mode output.   Optional  &lt;fitorder&gt;  specifies  the  fit  order  for  the
              dewarping curves.  Can be 2, 3, or 4.

              Default is 4.

              [Advanced:  You  can actually make the fit order a two-digit code.  E.g. <b>-dw</b> 24 will use 4th-order
              on  each  row  of  text  but  only  2nd-order  for  columns   of   displacement   (see   leptonica
              dewarpFindVertDisparity() in dewarp2.c)]

              Note:  de-warping,  like  auto-straighten and auto-crop, is intended for entire pages. It does not
              work on cropped areas.  If you want it to work on cropped areas, you should run  k2pdfopt  in  two
              passes--first to create selected crop areas (e.g. <b>-mode</b> crop), then to apply dewarping.

              Require k2pdfopt built with leptonica.

       <b>-ehl</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              Same  as  <b>-evl</b>,  except  erases horizontal lines instead of vertical lines.  See <b>-evl</b>.  Default is
              <b>-ehl</b> 0.

       <b>-er</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              Use erosion filter on source bitmaps.  Makes the text look darker.  A larger value  of  &lt;n&gt;  makes
              the text thicker/darker.  Try <b>-er</b> 1 or <b>-er</b> 2.  Default is 0 (no erosion filtering).

              Use  a  negative value for <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> to do the erosion before the contrast adjustment is applied.  Use a
              positive value to to the erosion after the  contrast  adjustment  is  applied.   This  option  may
              magnify scanning defects, so you might want to combine with the <b>-de</b> (defect removal) option.

              Has no effect in native mode output. See also <b>-de</b>, <b>-g</b>, <b>-cmax</b>.

       <b>-evl</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              Detects  and  erases  vertical  lines  in  the  source document which may be keeping k2pdfopt from
              correctly separating columns or wrapping text, e.g. column dividers.  If  <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>  is  zero,  this  is
              turned  off (the default).  If <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> is 1, only free-standing vertical lines are removed.  If <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> is
              2, vertical lines are erased even if they are the sides of an enclosed rectangle  or  figure,  for
              example.

       <b>-f2p</b> <u>&lt;val&gt;</u>
              Fit-to-page  option.   The  quantity <u>&lt;val&gt;</u> controls fitting tall or small contiguous objects (like
              figures or photographs) to the device screen.  Normally these are fit to the width of the  device,
              but  if  they are too small or too tall, then if <u>&lt;val&gt;</u>=10, for example, they are allowed to be 10%
              wider (if too small) or narrower (if too tall) than the screen in order to fit better.  Use -1  to
              fit the object no matter what.  Use -2 as a special case--all "red-boxed" regions (see <b>-sm</b> option)
              are placed one per page.

              Use  <b>-f2p</b>  -3  to  fit  as many "red-boxed" regions as possible on each page without breaking them
              across pages.  (see <b>-mode</b> concat).

              Default is <b>-f2p</b> 0.  See also <b>-jf</b>, <b>-fr</b>.

              Note:  <b>-f2p</b> -2 will automatically also set <b>-vb</b> -2 to exactly preserve the spacing in the red-boxed
              region.  If you want to compress the vertical spacing in the red-boxed region, use <b>-f2p</b> -2 <b>-vb</b> -1.

       <b>-fc[-]</b> For multiple column documents, fit  [don't  fit]  columns  to  the  width  of  the  reader  screen
              regardless of <b>-odpi</b>.

              Default is to fit the columns to the reader.

       <b>-fr[-]</b> Figure  rotate--rotates wide-aspect-ratio figures to landscape so that they best fit on the reader
              page.  Default is not to rotate.  See also <b>-f2p</b>.

       <b>-fs</b> <u>&lt;points&gt;</u>[+]
              The output document is scaled so that the median font size  in  the  converted  file  is  <u>&lt;points&gt;</u>
              points.   If  the  <u>&lt;points&gt;</u>  value  is followed by a '+', the scaling is adjusted for every source
              page, otherwise the font size is only adjusted once, based on the median font size for the  entire
              source  document.   The  default is <b>-fs</b> 0, which turns off scaling based on font size.  The use of
              <b>-fs</b> overrides the <b>-mag</b> setting.

       <b>-g</b> <u>&lt;gamma&gt;</u>
              Set gamma value of output bitmaps. A value less than 1.0 makes the page darker and  may  make  the
              font more readable.  Default is 0.5.  Has no effect with native-mode output.  See also <b>-er</b>, <b>-cmax</b>.

       <b>-grid</b> <u>&lt;C&gt;</u>x<u>&lt;R&gt;</u>[x<u>&lt;O&gt;</u>][+]
              Grid  the  source page into <u>&lt;C&gt;</u> columns by <u>&lt;R&gt;</u> rows with with <u>&lt;O&gt;</u> percent overlap.  No regard will
              be made for trying to break the page between columns or rows of text.  If a +  is  specified,  the
              destination  page  order  will go across and then down, otherwise it will go down and then across.
              To turn off gridding, specify a zero value for the  columns  or  for  the  rows.   Default  is  no
              gridding.   The default overlap is 2%.  Example:  <b>-grid</b> 2x2x5.  By default, gridding also sets the
              following options, which can be overridden  by  following  the  grid  option  with  other  command
              options:  <b>-n</b>  <b>-wrap-</b> <b>-f2p</b> -2 <b>-vb</b> -2 <b>-col</b> 1.  For example, if you want a column search done on each
              grid piece, you can put this: <b>-grid</b> 2x2 <b>-col</b> 2.  See also <b>-cbox</b>.

       <b>-gs[-][-]</b>
              Force use of Ghostscript instead of MuPDF to read PDFs.  K2pdfopt  has  built-in  PDF  translation
              (via  the  MuPDF  library)  but  will  try  to use Ghostscript if Ghostscript is available and the
              internal (MuPDF) translation fails (virtually never happens).  You can  force  Ghostscript  to  be
              used  with  this <b>-gs</b> option.  Use <b>-gs-</b> to use Ghostscript only if MuPDF fails.  Use <b>-gs--</b> to never
              use Ghostscript.  Download ghostscript at <a href="http://www.ghostscript.com">http://www.ghostscript.com</a>.

       <b>-gtc</b> <u>&lt;inches&gt;</u>
              Threshold value for detecting column gaps (expert mode).  Sets how  many  of  the  pixels  in  the
              column  shaft  can  be  non-white (total height of a line crossing the shaft in inches).  See also
              <b>-gtr</b>.  Default = .005.

       <b>-gtr</b> <u>&lt;inches&gt;</u>
              Threshold for detecting gaps between rows (expert  mode).   This  sets  the  maximum  total  black
              pixels,  in  inches,  on  average,  that  can be in each row of pixels before the gap is no longer
              considered a gap.  A higher value makes it easier to detect gaps between rows of text.   Too  high
              of a value may inadvertently split figures and other graphics.

              Default = 0.006.  See also <b>-rsf</b>.

       <b>-gtw</b> <u>&lt;inches&gt;</u>
              Threshold for detecting word gaps (expert mode).

              See <b>-gtr</b>.  Default = .0015.

       <b>-gui[-]</b>
              Use [don't use] graphical user interface (MS Windows only).  If k2pdfopt is started from a console
              (command-line),  the  default  is  not to launch the gui unless there are no command- line options
              given.  If k2pdfopt is launched via its icon, then the default is to launch the GUI.

       <b>-guimin[-]</b>
              Start the k2pdfopt GUI minimized.  Def = not minimized.

       <b>-h</b> <u>&lt;height&gt;</u>[in|cm|s|t|p|x]
              Set height of output device in pixels, inches, cm, source page size  (s),  trimmed  source  region
              size (t), pixels (p), or relative to the OCR text layer (x).

              The  default units are pixels (p), and the default value is 735 (the height of the Kindle 2 screen
              in pixels).

              Examples:

                        <b>-h</b> 6.5in
                               Sets the device height to 6.5 in (using the output dpi to convert to  pixels--see
                               <b>-dpi</b>).

                        <b>-h</b> 1.5s
                               Sets the device height to 1.5 times the source page height (same as <b>-h</b> -1.5).

                        <b>-h</b> 1t  Sets  the  device  height  to whatever the trimmed page height is (you can follow
                               <b>-mode</b> copy with <b>-h</b> 1t to make the output  page  height  equal  to  the  crop  box
                               height.

                        <b>-h</b> 0.5x
                               Sets  the  device height to half of the height of the box exactly surrounding the
                               OCR text layer on the source page.

              See also <b>-w</b>, <b>-dpi</b>, <b>-dr</b>.

       <b>-hy[-]</b> Turn on [off] hyphen detection/elimination when wrapping text.  Default is on.

       <b>-i</b>     Echo information about the source file (PDF only).

              Disables all other processing.

       <b>-ibox[</b><u>&lt;pagelist&gt;</u><b>|-|u]</b> <u>&lt;cropbox&gt;</u>
              Same as <b>-cbox</b> (see <b>-cbox</b>), except that these boxes are ignored  by  k2pdfopt.   This  is  done  by
              whiting  out  the  boxes  in the source bitmap.  For native output, the area in the <b>-ibox</b> will not
              affect the parsing of the source file, but it may still be visible in the output file.  Default is
              no iboxes (<b>-ibox-</b>).  See also <b>-cbox</b>.

       <b>-idpi</b> <u>&lt;dpi&gt;</u>
              Set pixels per inch for input file.  Use a negative value as a multiplier on the output dpi  (e.g.
              -2 will set the input file dpi to twice the output file dpi (see <b>-odpi</b>).  Default is -2.0.

       <b>-j</b> -1|0|1|2[+/-]
              Set  output  text  justification.   0  =  left,  1  =  center, 2 = right.  Add a + to attempt full
              justification or a - to explicitly turn it off.  The default is -1, which tells  k2pdfopt  to  try
              and maintain the justification of the document as it is.  See also <b>-wrap</b>.

       <b>-jf</b> 0|1|2 [<u>&lt;inches&gt;</u>]
              Set  figure  (tall  region)  justification.  If a figure has left or right margins available, this
              option allows you to set the justification differently than the text.  E.g. you can center figures
              with <b>-jf</b> 1.  If you want to specify a minimum height for figures (e.g. minimum region height where
              this justification applies), you can tack it on at the end, e.g. <b>-jf</b> 1 1.5 to  center  any  region
              taller  than  1.5  inches.   Default  is  0.75  inches  for the minimum height and to use the same
              justification on figures as the rest of the document (<b>-jf</b> -1).  See also <b>-f2p</b> to fit small or tall
              figures to the page.

       <b>-jfc[-|+]</b>
              Attempt [do not attempt] to keep figure captions joined with their figures.  If you specify <b>-jfc</b>+,
              k2pdfopt will also try to detect figure captions in multi-column documents.  This is not  done  by
              default because k2pdfopt will sometimes (more often than not, in my experience) incorrectly choose
              the  multi-column  layout  if it is also trying to detect what is a figure caption.  See also <b>-cg</b>,
              <b>-cgmax</b>, <b>-cgr</b>, <b>-crgh</b>.  Default = <b>-jfc</b>.

       <b>-jpg</b> [<u>&lt;quality&gt;</u>]
              Use JPEG compression in PDF file with quality level <u>&lt;quality&gt;</u> (def=90).   A  lower  quality  value
              will make your file smaller.  See also <b>-png</b>. Use of <b>-jpg</b> is incompatible with the <b>-bpc</b> option.

       <b>-l</b> <u>&lt;lang&gt;</u>
              See <b>-ocrlang</b>.

       <b>-lang</b> <u>&lt;lang&gt;</u>
              See <b>-ocrlang</b>.

       <b>-ls[-][</b><u>pagelist</u><b>]</b>
              Set  output  to  be in landscape [portrait] mode.  The default is <b>-ls-</b> (portrait).  If an optional
              pagelist is specified, only those pages are affected--any other pages are done  oppositely.   E.g.
              <b>-ls</b>1,3,5-10 would make source pages 1, 3 and 5 through 10 landscape.

       <b>-m[l|t|r|b]</b> <u>&lt;val&gt;</u>[<u>&lt;units&gt;</u>][,<u>&lt;val&gt;</u>[<u>units</u>][,...]]
              Set  global crop margins for every page.  If more than one value is given (comma-delimited with no
              spaces in between), the order is left, top, right, bottom, e.g. <b>-m</b>  <u>&lt;left&gt;</u>,<u>&lt;top&gt;</u>,<u>&lt;right&gt;</u>,<u>&lt;bottom&gt;</u>.
              You  can  also  use  the  more powerful <b>-cbox</b> option to do this same thing.  The default units are
              inches.  For available units and their descriptions, see <b>-h</b>.

              Examples:

              <b>-m</b> 0.5cm
                     Sets all margins to 0.5 cm.

              <b>-m</b> 0.5cm,1.0cm
                     Sets the left margin to 0.5 cm and all the other margins to 1.0 cm.

              <b>-m</b> 0.2in,0.5in,0.2in,0.5in
                     Sets the left and right crop margins to 0.2 inches and the top and bottom to 0.5 inches.

              <b>-mt</b> 1cm
                     Sets the top margin to 0.5 cm.

              <b>-m</b> -0.1x,-0.1x,1.1x,1.1x
                     With the 'x' unit, the behavior is a little different.  Rather than specifying  the  widths
                     of  each margin, you specify the position of the crop box relative to the OCR text layer in
                     the source file, where 0x,0x,1x,1x would exactly bound the OCR text layer.

              The default crop margins are 0 inches.

              [NOTE: The default was 0.25 inches for all margins before v1.65.]

              See also <b>-cbox</b> and <b>-ac</b> to autocrop scanning artifacts.

       <b>-mag</b> <u>&lt;value&gt;</u>
              Magnify the converted document (text) size by <u>&lt;value&gt;</u>.  Default is <b>-mag</b> 1 (no magnification).  See
              also <b>-fs</b>.

       <b>-mc[-]</b> Mark  [don't  mark]  corners  of the output bitmaps with a small dot to prevent the reading device
              from re-scaling.  Default = mark.

       <b>-mode</b> <u>&lt;mode&gt;</u>
              Shortcut for setting multiple options at once which determine the basic way in which k2pdfopt will
              behave.

              Available modes are:

              copy   Same as <b>-n-</b> <b>-wrap-</b> <b>-col</b> 1 <b>-vb</b> -2 <b>-w</b> 1s <b>-h</b> 1s <b>-dpi</b> 150 <b>-rt</b> 0 <b>-c</b> <b>-t-</b> <b>-f2p</b> -2 <b>-m</b> 0 <b>-om</b> 0 <b>-pl</b> 0
                     <b>-pr</b> 0 <b>-pt</b> 0 <b>-pb</b> 0 <b>-mc-</b>.  Makes k2pdfopt behave exactly like my pdfr  program--source  pages
                     are simply copied to the output file, but rendered as bitmaps.  No trimming or re-sizing is
                     done.  Can also use <b>-mode</b> pdfr.

                     Note 1:  Use <b>-mode</b> copy <b>-n</b> if you want an exact copy (output in native mode).

                     Note  2:  The default gamma and contrast settings are not reset by <b>-mode</b> copy.  If you want
                            a perfect copy, do this:
                                   -mode copy -gamma 1 -cmax 1

              fp     Also can use fitpage.  Same as <b>-n</b> <b>-wrap-</b> <b>-col</b> 1 <b>-vb</b> -2 <b>-f2p</b> -2 <b>-t</b>.

              fw     Same as <b>-n</b> <b>-wrap-</b> <b>-col</b> 1 <b>-vb</b> -2 <b>-t</b> <b>-ls</b>.  Makes k2pdfopt behave  like  sopdf's  "fit  width"
                     option.  Can also use <b>-mode</b> sopdf.

              2col   Same  as  <b>-n</b>  <b>-wrap-</b>  <b>-col</b>  2  <b>-vb</b> -2 <b>-t</b>.  Optimizes for a 2-column scientific article with
                     native PDF output.

              tm     Trim margins--same as <b>-mode</b> copy, but sets the output to be trimmed to the margins and  the
                     width  and  height of the output to match the trimmed source pages.  Also uses native mode.
                     Equivalent to <b>-n</b> <b>-wrap-</b> <b>-col</b> 1 <b>-vb</b> -2 <b>-f2p</b> -2 <b>-t</b> <b>-w</b> 1t <b>-h</b> 1t <b>-rt</b> 0 <b>-c</b> <b>-m</b> 0 <b>-om</b> 0 <b>-pl</b> 0  <b>-pr</b>
                     0 <b>-pt</b> 0 <b>-pb</b> 0 <b>-mc-</b>.  Can also use <b>-mode</b> trim.

              crop   Used with <b>-cbox</b> option, puts each cropped area on a separate page, untrimmed, and sizes the
                     page  to the cropped region.  Same as <b>-wrap-</b> <b>-col</b> 1 <b>-vb</b> -2 <b>-w</b> 1t <b>-h</b> 1t <b>-t-</b> <b>-rt</b> 0 <b>-c</b> <b>-f2p</b> -2
                     <b>-m</b> 0 <b>-om</b> 0 <b>-pad</b> 0 <b>-mc-</b> <b>-n</b> concat Keeping the output pages  the  same  size  as  the  source
                     pages, fit as many crop-boxed regions on the output pages as possible without breaking them
                     across  pages.  Equivalent to: <b>-n</b> <b>-wrap-</b> <b>-col</b> 1 <b>-vb</b> -2 <b>-t-</b> <b>-f2p</b> -3 <b>-fc-</b> <b>-w</b> 1s <b>-h</b> 1s <b>-ocrdef</b>

                     0.02 <b>-ls-</b>.

              concat Keeping  the output pages the same size as the source pages, fit as many crop-boxed regions
                     on the output pages as possible without breaking them  across  pages.   Equivalent  to:  <b>-n</b>

                     <b>-wrap-</b> <b>-col</b> 1 <b>-vb</b> -2 <b>-t-</b> <b>-f</b>2p -3 <b>-fc-</b> <b>-w</b> 1s <b>-h</b> 1s <b>-ocr-</b>

              You can modify modes by overriding their options after specifying the mode, e.g. <b>-mode</b> fw <b>-vb</b> -1.

       <b>-n[-]</b>  Use "native" PDF output format.  NOTE: if you want native PDF output, it's probably best to use  a
              <b>-mode</b>  option  like  <b>-mode</b>  fitwidth or <b>-mode</b> 2col, both of which automatically turn on native PDF
              output and optimize other settings for it.  Native PDF output  preserves  the  native  source  PDF
              contents,  i.e.  the  output PDF file is not rendered as a sequence of bitmapped pages like in the
              default k2pdfopt output mode.  Instead, the  source  PDF's  native  content  is  used  along  with
              additional  PDF  instructions  to  translate, scale, and crop the source content.  With native PDF
              output, if the source file has selectable text, the text remains selectable in  the  output  file.
              The  output  file  can also be zoomed without loss of fidelity.  This may also result in a smaller
              output file (but not always).  By default, native PDF output  format  is  turned  off.   See  also
              <b>-mode</b>.

              NOTES:

              1.     Native  PDF  output cannot be used with text wrapping on (see <b>-wrap</b> option).  Turning it on
                     will disable text wrapping.

              2.     Native PDF output is not recommended for source  files  which  are  scanned  (there  is  no
                     benefit unless the scanned document includes a layer of OCR text).

              3.     Native  PDF  output  is  incompatible  with  OCR  (see  <b>-ocr</b>),  though OCR is typically not
                     necessary if the native PDF contents are kept.  Turning on native PDF output  will  disable
                     OCR.

              4.     Native PDF output can only be used with PDF source files (it does not work with DJVU source
                     files).

              5.     Contrast adjust, gamma correction, and sharpening are disabled with native PDF output.

              6.     It  is  recommended  that  you  use  <b>-vb</b> <b>-2</b> with native PDF output, particularly if you are
                     having difficulty selecting/searching text in the output PDF file.

              7.     This option works well with <b>-mode</b> fw, <b>-mode</b> 2col, or with the <b>-grid</b> option.  It is used  by
                     default in those cases.

       <b>-neg[-|+]</b>
              Inverse  [don't  inverse]  the output images (white letters on black background, or "night mode").
              If <b>-neg</b>+, inverts all graphics no matter what.  If just <b>-neg</b>, attempts to invert text only and not
              figures.  Default = <b>-neg-</b>.

              See also <b>-colorbg</b> and <b>-colorfg</b>.

       <b>-ng</b> <u>&lt;gap&gt;</u>
              Set gap between notes and main text in the output document.  The <u>&lt;gap&gt;</u> defaults to inches but  can
              have  other  units  (see  <b>-h</b>,  for example).  See <b>-nl</b> and <b>-nr</b> for how to turn on notes processing.
              Default is <b>-ng</b> 0.2.

       <b>-nl[</b><u>&lt;pages&gt;</u><b>]</b> [<u>&lt;leftbound&gt;</u>,<u>&lt;rightbound&gt;</u>]

       <b>-nr[</b><u>&lt;pages&gt;</u><b>]</b> [<u>&lt;leftbound&gt;</u>,<u>&lt;rightbound&gt;</u>]
              The source document has notes in the left (<b>-nl</b>) or right (<b>-nr</b>) margins.   Specific  pages  can  be
              specified  for  the notes using <u>&lt;pages&gt;</u> (same format as <b>-cbox</b> or <b>-p</b>).  If <u>&lt;leftbound&gt;</u>,<u>&lt;rightbound&gt;</u>
              are specified, they specify the fraction of the page width where to look for the break between the
              notes and the main page.  E.g.  <b>-nl</b> 0.15,0.25 will look for the boundary between the notes and the
              text between 15% and 25% of the way across the source page.  Use <b>-nl-</b> to turn off  all  processing
              of  notes  in  the margins (default).  Default values for <u>&lt;leftbound&gt;</u> and <u>&lt;rightbound&gt;</u> are 0.05 to
              0.35 for <b>-nl</b> and 0.65 to 0.95 for <b>-nr</b>.

              Notes in the margins are treated  differently  than  other  "columns"  of  text.    They  will  be
              interspersed  with  the text in the adjacent column of main text.  Note that <b>-nr</b>... or <b>-nl</b>... will
              also set <b>-cg</b> to 0.05.

       <b>-nt</b> <u>&lt;nthreads&gt;</u>
              Use <u>&lt;nthreads&gt;</u> parallel threads when OCR-ing a document with the Tesseract OCR engine (GOCR is not
              thread safe).  This may provide a significant processing speed improvement  when  using  Tesseract
              OCR.   Note  that a higher number is not always faster.  You should experiment with your system to
              find the optimum.  A negative value is interpreted as a percentage of available CPUs.  The default
              is <b>-50</b>, which tells k2pdfopt to use half of  the  available  CPU  threads.   Some  performances  I
              measured:

              NOTE:  <b>-nt</b> has no effect if you select <b>-ocrd</b> c or <b>-ocrd</b> p.  See <b>-ocrd</b>.

              Require k2pdfopt built with OCR lib.

       <b>-o</b> <u>&lt;namefmt&gt;</u>
              Set  the  output  file name using <u>&lt;namefmt&gt;</u>.  %s will be replaced with the full name of the source
              file minus the extension.  %b will be replaced by the base name  of  the  source  file  minus  the
              extension.  %f will be replaced with the folder name of the source file.  %d will be replaced with
              the source file count (starting with 1).  The .pdf extension will be appended if you don't specify
              an  extension.   E.g. <b>-o</b> out%04d.pdf will result in output files out0001.pdf, out0002.pdf, ... for
              the converted files.  Def = %s_k2opt

              <b>-------------------------------------------------------------</b>

              BITMAP OUTPUT:  For output to bitmaps, you can put <b>-o</b> .png or  <b>-o</b>  .jpg  (see  <b>-jpeg</b>  for  quality
              setting).

              <b>-------------------------------------------------------------</b>

              MORE  DETAIL:   If  <u>&lt;namefmt&gt;</u>  ends  in .jpg or .png, the output will be in the JPEG or PNG bitmap
              format, respectively, one bitmap per page.  If your <u>&lt;namefmt&gt;</u> has no %d in it, then %04d  will  be
              appended.   If <u>&lt;namefmt&gt;</u> has only one %d, it will get substituted with the page number.  If it has
              two %d's, the first will get the file count and the second will get the page number.  Example:  if
              the  source PDF is myfile.pdf, then <b>-o</b> %s%03d.png would create myfile001.png, myfile002.png, etc.,
              for each page of the PDF.

       <b>-ocr[-][g|t|m]</b>
              Attempt [don't attempt] to use optical character recognition (OCR) in order  to  embed  searchable
              text  into  the  output  PDF  document.   If  followed  by t or g, specifies the ocr engine to use
              (tesseract or gocr).  If followed by m, and if the PDF document has text in  it,  then  the  MuPDF
              engine  is  used  to  extract  the  text  (sort  of  a virtual OCR).  If <b>-ocr</b> is specified with no
              argument, tesseract is used.  If tesseract fails (e.g. no language files  found),  GOCR  is  used.
              The overall default operation of k2pdfopt is <b>-ocr</b> m.  See also <b>-ocrvis</b> and <b>-ocrhmax</b>.

              NOTE:  Turning on OCR will disable native PDF output.

              DISCLAIMER:   The  main  intent  of OCR isn't to improve the visual quality of the text at all--at
                  least not the way k2pdfopt does it.  OCR is most  useful  on  scanned  PDFs  that  don't  have
                  selectable  text  to  begin with, but using OCR with k2pdfopt on such documents doesn't change
                  the look of the output PDF file at all.  The OCR text is  simply  placed  invisibly  over  the
                  scanned  text so that you appear to be able to select the scanned text (when, in fact, you are
                  selecting the invisibly placed OCR text).  So the only time  you  will  even  notice  the  OCR
                  errors  is  if  you  try to search for a word and can't find that word because the OCR of that
                  word is incorrect, or if you copy a selection of the OCR text and paste it into something else
                  so that you can actually see it.

       <b>-ocrcol</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              If you are simply processing a PDF to OCR it (e.g. if you are using the <b>-mode</b> copy option) and the
              source document has multiple columns of text, set this value to the number of columns  to  process
              (up to 4).  Default is to use the same value as <b>-col</b>.

       <b>-ocrd</b> w|l|c|p

              Set OCR detection type for k2pdfopt and Tesseract.  <u>&lt;type&gt;</u> can be word (w), line (l), columns (c),
              or page (p).  Default is line.

              For  <b>-ocrd</b>  w,  k2pdfopt  locates each word in the scanned document and passes individual words to
              Tesseract for OCR conversion.  This was the only type of detection before  v2.42  but  is  not  an
              optimal OCR conversion method when using Tesseract.

              For  <b>-ocrd</b>  l,  k2pdfopt passes each line of the converted file to Tesseract for conversion.  This
              typically gives better results than <b>-ocrd</b> w since Tesseract can better determine the text baseline
              position with a full line.

              For <b>-ocrd</b> c, k2pdfopt detects each column of the converted file and passes that to  Tesseract  for
              conversion.

              For  <b>-ocrd</b> p, k2pdfopt passes the entire output page of text to Tesseract and lets Tesseract parse
              it for word positions.  Tesseract has done considerable code development for  detecting  words  on
              pages (more than k2pdfopt), so this should also be a reliable way to create the OCR layer.

              One  drawback  to  <b>-ocrd</b>  c  or <b>-ocr</b> p is that there is no benefit to using the OCR multithreading
              option (see <b>-nt</b>).

              Require k2pdfopt built with leptonica.

       <b>-ocrhmax</b> <u>&lt;in&gt;</u>
              Set max height for an OCR'd word in inches.   Any  graphic  exceeding  this  height  will  not  be
              processed with the OCR engine.  Default = 1.5.  See <b>-ocr</b>.

       <b>-ocrlang</b> <u>&lt;lang&gt;</u>|?
              Select  the Tesseract OCR Engine language.  This is the root name of the training data, e.g. <b>-lang</b>
              eng for English, <b>-ocrlang</b> fra for French, <b>-ocrlang</b> chi_sim for simplified Chinese.  You  can  also
              use  <b>-l</b>.   The default language is whatever is in your Tesseract trained data folder.  If you have
              more than one .traineddata file in that folder, the one with the most recent time stamp is used.

              NOTE 1: Use <b>-ocrvis</b> ? to see the list of Tesseract language files in your Tesseract data folder.

              NOTE 2: Using the <b>-ocrvis</b> t option will not show the OCR text correctly for  any  character  above
              unicode value 255 since k2pdfopt does not use any embedded fonts, but the text will convert to the
              correct Unicode values when copy / pasted.

              NOTE  3:  Tesseract  allows  the  specification of multiple language training files, e.g. <b>-ocrlang</b>
              eng+fra would specify English as the primary  and  French  as  the  secondary  OCR  language.   In
              practice I have not found this to work very well.  Try multiple languages in different orders.

              Require k2pdfopt built with leptonica.

       <b>-ocrdpi</b> <u>&lt;dpi&gt;</u>

              Set  the  desired dpi of the bitmaps passed to the OCR engine OR set the desired height of a lower
              case letter (e.g. 'e') in pixels.  If <u>&lt;dpi&gt;</u> is positive, it is interpreted as dpi.   If  <u>&lt;dpi&gt;</u>  is
              negative, the absolute value is interpreted as a lowercase letter height in pixels.  Any bitmapped
              text  sent  to  the  OCR  engine will be downsampled (if too large) so that the appropriate dpi or
              lowercase letter size is achieved.

              The default is 300 because I've found this works best empirically for Tesseract v4.0.0 English OCR
              with font sizes in the range 8 - 15 pts.  Use a lower value if the font size in your  document  is
              larger  than 15 - 20 pts.  Or use <b>-ocrdpi</b> -24 if you have a wide range of font sizes.  Use <b>-ocrdpi</b>
              0 to disable any downsampling.

       <b>-ocrout[-]</b> <u>&lt;namefmt&gt;</u>
              Write [don't write] UTF-8 OCR text output to file <u>&lt;namefmt&gt;</u>.  See the <b>-o</b> option for more about how
              <u>&lt;namefmt&gt;</u> works.  Default extension is .txt.  Default is no output.

       <b>-ocrsort[-]</b>
              When a PDF document has its own OCR/Text layer, this option orders  the  OCR  text  layer  by  its
              position  on  the  page.   This  should  not  be  necessary  unless  the OCR layer was very poorly
              generated.  Default is <b>-ocrsort-</b> (off).

       <b>-ocrsp[+|-]</b>
              When generating the OCR layer, do an entire row of text at once, with spaces between  each  words.
              By default (<b>-ocrsp-</b>), each word is placed separately in the PDF document's OCR layer.  This causes
              problems  with  text selection in some readers (for example, individual words cannot be selected).
              Using <b>-ocrsp-</b> may fix behavior like this, but will result in less accurate  word  placement  since
              k2pdfopt  does  not try to exactly match the font used by the document.  Use <b>-ocrsp</b>+ to allow more
              than one space between each word in the row of text in order to optimize the selection position.

       <b>-ocrvis</b> &lt;s|t|b&gt;
              Set OCR visibility flags.  Put 's' to show the source doc, 't' to show the OCR text, and/or 'b' to
              put a box around each word.  Default is <b>-ocrvis</b> s.  To show both the source document and  the  OCR
              text overlayed on top:  <b>-ocrvis</b> st.  See also <b>-ocr</b>.  See also <b>-ocrlang</b> (the note about <b>-ocrvis</b> t).

       <b>-odpi</b> <u>&lt;dpi&gt;</u>
              Set  pixels per inch of output screen (def=167). See also <b>-dr</b>, <b>-w</b>, <b>-h</b>, <b>-fc</b>.  You can also use <b>-dpi</b>
              for this.

              See also <b>-fs</b>, <b>-mag</b>.

       <b>-om[b|l|r|t]</b> <u>&lt;val&gt;</u>[<u>&lt;units&gt;</u>][,<u>&lt;val&gt;</u>[<u>units</u>][,...]]
              Set the blank area margins on the output device.  Works very much like the <b>-m</b> option.  See <b>-m</b>  for
              more about the syntax.  Default = 0.02 inches.

              Note  that  the  's', 't', and 'x' units for <b>-om</b> all behave the same and scale to the device size.
              E.g. <b>-om</b> 0.1s will make the device screen margins 0.1 times the device width  (for  the  left  and
              right margins) or height (for the top and bottom margins) of the output device screen.

       <b>-ow[-]</b> [<u>&lt;mb&gt;</u>]
              Set  the  minimum file size (in MB) where overwriting the file will not be done without prompting.
              Set to -1 (or just <b>-ow</b> with no value) to overwrite all files with no prompting.  Set to 0 (or just
              <b>-ow-</b>) to prompt for any overwritten file.  Def = <b>-ow</b> 10 (any existing file over 10 MB will not  be
              overwritten without prompting).  See also <b>-y</b> option.

       <b>-p</b> <u>&lt;pagelist&gt;</u>
              Specify  pages  to  convert.   <u>&lt;pagelist&gt;</u>  must not have any spaces.  E.g. <b>-p</b> 1-3,5,9,10- would do
              pages 1 through 3, page 5, page 9, and pages 10 through the end.  The letters 'e' and 'o'  can  be
              used to denote even and odd pages, e.g.

              <b>-p</b> o,e Process all odd pages, then all even ones.

              <b>-p</b> 2-52e,3-33o
                     Process 2,4,6,...,52,3,5,7,...,33.

              Overridden by <b>-px</b> option.  See <b>-px</b>.

       <b>-pad</b> <u>&lt;padlist&gt;</u>
              A  shortcut for <b>-pl</b>, <b>-pt</b>, <b>-pr</b>, <b>-pb</b>.  E.g. <b>-pad</b> 15,10,13,20 is the same as <b>-pl</b> 15 <b>-pt</b> 10 <b>-pr</b> 13 <b>-pb</b>
              20.  Also, using <b>-pad</b> 15 will set all pads to 15, for example.

       <b>-p[b|l|r|t]</b> <u>&lt;nn&gt;</u>
              Pad [bottom|left|right|top] side of destination bitmap with <u>&lt;nn&gt;</u> rows.  Defaults = 4  (bottom),  0
              (left), 3 (right), and 0 (top).  Example:  <b>-pb</b> 10.  This is typically only used on certain devices
              to  get  the  page to come out just right.  For setting margins on the output device, use <b>-om</b>. See
              also <b>-pad</b>.

       <b>-png</b>   (Default) Use PNG compression in PDF file.  See also <b>-jpeg</b>.

       <b>-ppgs[-]</b>
              Post process [do not post process] with ghostscript.  This will take  the  final  PDF  output  and
              process  it using ghostscript's pdfwrite device (assuming ghostscript is available).  A benefit to
              doing this is that all "invisible" and/or overlapping text regions (outside  cropping  areas)  get
              completely removed, so that text selection capability is improved.  The actual ghostscript command
              used is:
              gs <b>-dSAFER</b> <b>-dBATCH</b> <b>-q</b> <b>-dNOPAUSE</b> <b>-sDEVICE</b>=<u>pdfwrite</u>
                 <b>-dPDFSETTINGS=</b>/prepress <b>-sOutputFile=</b><u>&lt;outfile&gt;</u>
                 <u>&lt;srcfile&gt;</u>
              The default is not to post process with ghostscript.

       <b>-px</b> <u>&lt;pagelist&gt;</u>
              Exclude pages from <u>&lt;pagelist&gt;</u>.  Overrides <b>-p</b> option.  Default is no excluded pages (<b>-px</b> -1).

       <b>-r[-]</b>  Right-to-left [left-to-right] page scans.  Default is left to right.

       <b>-rls[+|-]</b>
              Restore  [+]  or  don't  restore  [-] the last command-line settings from the environment variable
              <b>K2PDFOPT_CUSTOM0</b>.  The  default  (<b>-rls</b>)  is  to  restore  the  settings  if  there  are  no  other
              command-line  options  specified  when running (from.  either the command line or the <b>K2PDFOPT</b> env
              var.), unless those options are "-gui" or specify a file name.

       <b>-rsf</b> <u>&lt;val&gt;</u>
              Row Split Figure of merit (expert mode).  After k2pdfopt has looked for gaps between rows of text,
              it will check to see if there appear to be missed gaps (e.g. if one row is twice the height of all
              the others).  Increasing this value makes it harder for k2pdfopt to  split  a  row.   Lowering  it
              makes it easier.  Default value = 20.

       <b>-rt</b> <u>&lt;deg&gt;</u>|auto[+]|aep
              Rotate source page counterclockwise by <u>&lt;deg&gt;</u> degrees.

              NOTE: If you're trying to get "landscape" output so that you can turn your reader on its side, use
              <b>-ls</b> instead of <b>-rt</b>.  The <b>-rt</b> option is intended to be used for when your source PDF is incorrectly
              rotated--e.g. if you view it on a standard PC reader and it comes up sideways.

              <u>&lt;deg&gt;</u>  can be 90, 180, 270.  Or use "-rt auto" to examine up to 10 pages of each file to determine
              the orientation used on the entire file (this is the default).  Or use "-rt  aep"  to  auto-detect
              the  rotation  of  every page.  If you have different pages that are rotated differently from each
              other within one file, you can use this option to try to autorotate each  source  page.   Use  <b>-rt</b>
              auto+ to turn on autodetect even in preview mode (otherwise it is off).

              See also <b>-ls</b>.

       <b>-s[-]</b>  Sharpen [don't sharpen] images.  Default is to sharpen.

       <b>-sm[-]</b> Show  [don't  show]  marked  source.  This is a debugging tool where k2pdfopt will mark the source
              file with the regions it finds on them and the order in which it processes them  and  save  it  as
              <u>&lt;srcfile&gt;</u>_marked.pdf.   Default  is not to show marked source.  Red regions are found on the first
              pass (use <b>-f2p</b> -2 to put each red region on a separate page).  Green lines mark  vertical  regions
              affected  by  <b>-vb</b>  and  <b>-vs</b>.  Gray lines mark individual rows of text (top, bottom, and baseline).
              Blue boxes show individual words (passed to OCR if <b>-ocr</b> is specified).

       <b>-sp[-]</b> For each file on the command-line, just echo the number of pages--don't process.   Default  =  off
              (<b>-sp-</b>).

       <b>-t[-]</b>  Trim [don't trim] the white space from around the edges of any output region.  Default is to trim.
              Using <b>-t-</b> is not recommended unless you want to exactly duplicate the source document.

       <b>-title</b> <u>&lt;title&gt;</u>
              Set  the  title metadata / property of the PDF output file(s).  Default is to use the title of the
              source document (<b>-title</b> "").  The <u>&lt;title&gt;</u> string will be parsed for special characters that  allow
              you to substitute the file name.  See the <b>-o</b> option for a description of these substitutions.

       <b>-to[-]</b> Text  only  output.   Remove  figures  from  output.   Figures  are  determined empirically as any
              contiguous region taller than 0.75 inches (or you can specify this using  the  <b>-jf</b>  option).   Use
              <b>-to-</b> to turn off (default).

       <b>-toc[-]</b>
              Include [don't include] table of contents / outline / bookmark information in the PDF output if it
              is  available  in  the  source file (works only for PDF source files and only if MuPDF is compiled
              in).  By default, a new destination page is started at each bookmark location.  Do  disable  this,
              see  the <b>-bp</b> option.  If <b>-toc-</b> is specified, bookmark information from the source file is ignored.
              See also <b>-toclist</b>.  Default is <b>-toc</b>.

       <b>-toclist</b> <u>&lt;pagelist&gt;</u>|<u>&lt;file&gt;</u>
              Override the PDF source file's outline information (bookmarks / table of contents) with  either  a
              list  of  source pages or a file describing the table of contents. If you specify a list of pages,
              e.g. <b>-toclist</b> 5,10,20,40,100 then those pages are marked as Chapter 1, 2, etc., respectively.   If
              you specify a file name, the file should be a text file formatted like this example:
                     1 Introduction
                     10 Chapter 1
                     +10 Chapter 1, Part A
                     +25 Chapter 1, Part B
                     ++25 Chapter 1, Part B, Subsection 1
                     ++27 Chapter 1, Part B, Subsection 2
                     +30 Chapter 1, Part C
                     50 Chapter 2
                     70 Chapter 3

              The '+' indicates a sub-level heading (multiple +'s for multiple sub-levels).  The first number on
              the line is the source page reference number.  The rest of the text on the line is the name of the
              chapter / subheading.

              Note:   This option overrides <b>-toc</b>.  To get a template from an existing PDF file, see the <b>-tocsave</b>
              option.

       <b>-tocsave</b> <u>&lt;file&gt;</u>
              If an outline exists in the PDF file (and <b>-toc</b> is specified)  write  that  outline  to  text  file
              <u>&lt;file&gt;</u> in the format required by <b>-toclist</b>.  See <b>-toc</b>, <b>-toclist</b>.

       <b>-ui[-]</b> User  input  query  turned  on  [off].   Default = on for linux or if not run from command line in
              Windows.

       <b>-v</b>     Verbose output.

       <b>-vb</b> <u>&lt;thresh&gt;</u>
              Set gap-size vertical-break threshold between regions that cause them to be  treated  as  separate
              regions.   E.g.  <b>-vb</b>  2 will break the document into separate regions anywhere there is a vertical
              gap that exceeds 2 times the median gap between lines of text.  These separate regions may then be
              scaled and aligned independently.

              Special values:  Use <b>-vb</b> -1 to preserve all horizontal alignment and scaling across entire regions
              (vertical spacing may still be adjusted).  Use <b>-vb</b>  -2  to  exactly  preserve  each  region  (both
              horizontal  alignment and vertical spacing--this is the value used by <b>-mode</b> fw, for example).  The
              default is <b>-vb</b> 1.75.

       <b>-vls</b> <u>&lt;spacing&gt;</u>
              Set vertical line spacing as a fraction of the text size.  This can be used to override  the  line
              spacing in a document.  If 1, then single spacing is used.  2 = double spacing.  If negative, then
              the  absolute  value  acts  as  the  limiting case.  E.g., if you set <b>-vls</b> -1.5, then any the line
              spacing of the original document is preserved  unless  it  exceeds  1.5  (times  single  spacing).
              Default = -1.2.  See also <b>-vs</b>.

       <b>-vs</b> <u>&lt;maxgap&gt;</u>
              Preserve  up  to  <u>&lt;maxgap&gt;</u>  inches  of vertical spacing between regions in the document (marked in
              green when using <b>-sm</b> option).  This value has no effect if you use a negative value for <b>-vb</b>.   The
              default value is 0.25.

              See also <b>-vls</b>, <b>-vb</b>.

       <b>-w</b> <u>&lt;width&gt;</u>[in|cm|s|t|p]
              Set width of output device.  Default is 560.  See <b>-h</b>.

       <b>-wrap[-|+]</b>
              Enable [disable] text wrapping.  Default = enabled.  If <b>-wrap</b>+, regions of text with lines shorter
              than  the  mobile device screen are re-flowed to fit the screen width.  If you use <b>-wrap</b>+, you may
              want to also specify <b>-fc-</b> so that narrow columns of text are not magnified  to  fit  your  device.
              Text wrapping disables native PDF output (see <b>-n</b> option).  See also <b>-ws</b>, <b>-j</b>, <b>-fc</b>, <b>-n</b>.

       <b>-ws</b> <u>&lt;spacing&gt;</u>
              Set  minimum word spacing for line breaking as a fraction of the height of a lowercase 'o'.  Use a
              larger value to make it harder to break lines.  If negative, automatic word spacing is turned  on.
              The  automatic  spacing leans toward breaking long words between letters to be sure to fit text to
              the device display.  Def = -0.20.  The absolute value of the setting, if negative, is  used  as  a
              minimum  allowed  value.   If you want k2pdfopt to aggressively break lines (e.g. break apart long
              words if they don't fit on a line), use a smaller absolute value,  e.g.  <b>-ws</b>  -0.01.   A  positive
              value  works  as it did in v2.18 and before.  The default value was changed from 0.375 in v2.18 to
              -0.20 in v2.20.  See also <b>-wrap</b>.

       <b>-wt[+]</b> <u>&lt;thresh&gt;</u>
              Any pixels whiter than <u>&lt;thresh&gt;</u> (0-255) are treated as  "white".   Setting  this  lower  can  help
              k2pdfopt better process some poorly-quality scanned pages or pages with watermarks.  Note that the
              pixels  which  are  above  <u>&lt;thresh&gt;</u>  threshold  value  and  therefore are treated as white are not
              actually changed to pure white (255) unless the '+' is also included.  Otherwise, this only sets a
              threshold.  The default value for <b>-wt</b> is -1, which tells k2pdfopt to pick the optimum value.   See
              also <b>-cmax</b>, <b>-colorfg</b>, <b>-colorbg</b>.

       <b>-x[-]</b>  Exit [don't exit--wait for &lt;Enter&gt;] after completion.

       <b>-y[-]</b>  Assume  [don't assume] "yes" to queries, such as whether to overwrite a file.  See also <b>-ow</b>.  Also
              turns off any warning messages.
