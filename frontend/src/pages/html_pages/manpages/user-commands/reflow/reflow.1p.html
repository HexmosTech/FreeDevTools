</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       reflow - Perl script for reflowing text files using Knuth's paragraphing algorithm.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       reflow &lt; input &gt; output

       reflow file1 file2 ... &gt; output

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Uses Knuth's paragraphing algorithm (as used in TeX) to "reflow" text files by picking "good" places to
       break the line.

       It takes an ascii text file (with paragraphs separated by blank lines) and reflows the paragraphs. If two
       or more lines in a row are "indented" then they are assumed to be a quoted poem and are passed through
       unchanged.  (The -skipindented causes ALL indented lines to be passed unchanged)

       The algorithm tries to keep the lines the same length but also tries to break at punctuation, and avoid
       breaking within a proper name or after certain "connectives" ("a", "the", etc.).

   <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-skipindented</b>
            Cause  ALL indented lines to be passed unchanged. Normally a single indented line is included in the
            paragraph, while two or more indented lines are considered to be a quotation or poem and are  passed
            through unchanged.

       <b>-fast</b>
            Sets the optimum line width to 65 characters. This is the default.

       <b>-slow</b>
            Tries line widths of 60, 65 and 70 characters and picks the best one.

       <b>-veryslow</b>
            Tries all line widths between 60 and 70 characters inclusive, and picks the best one. With the <b>-slow</b>
            and  <b>-veryslow</b>  options  the  line widths within a paragraph will vary less, but the line widths may
            vary from one paragraph to the next.

       <b>-skipto</b> <b>pattern</b>
            Skip to the first line starting with the given pattern before starting to reflow.   This  is  useful
            for skipping Project Gutenberg headers or contents tables.

            See  <b>Text::<a href="../man3/Reflow.3.html">Reflow</a></b>(3)  for  more  options:  all  the keyword options defined in Text::Reflow are also
            available via the reflow script.
