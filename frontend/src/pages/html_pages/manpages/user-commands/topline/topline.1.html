</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       topline - a disk/per-core CPU grapher/logger

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>topline</b> [ <u>-l</u> ] [ <u>-i</u> <u>1.0</u> ] [ <u>-o</u> <u>logfile</u> ] [ <u>program</u> <u>arg1</u> <u>arg2</u> <u>...</u>  ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       While programs like <b>htop</b> can show per-core loads, they do so interactively.  There are loggers like <b>dstat</b>
       but, using numeric data, they have no chance to fit per-CPU information within a line on modern many-core
       processors.   Thus,  <b>topline</b>  uses  Unicode  graphing  symbols  to  squash  the  data  into a terse, two-
       hyperthreads-per-char, form.  This allows eyeballing NUMA separation, CPU hopping, etc.

       Once per second, <b>topline</b> plots stats for that interval:

       per every disk,
              one character with two columns of dots gives that disk's utilization time  percentage.   The  left
              column  shows  reads,  the right one shows writes.  Disks are grouped into parenthesised groups by
              interface type (NVMe, SATA, eMMC, ...).

       per every non-hyperthreaded CPU or a pair of hyperthreaded siblings,
              a character with one or two columns is given.  Non-HT CPUS are drawn with bars, HT ones with dots,
              offline cores are marked with 'o'.  The parentheses group CPUs by their NUMA node.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>&lt;program&gt;</u> <u>&lt;arg1&gt;</u> <u>&lt;arg2&gt;</u> <u>...</u>
              Runs a program and terminates the graph once the program exits.   The  graph  still  exhibits  the
              global state of the system rather than just the program you chose and its children.

       If no program is given, <b>topline</b> will keep logging forever (ie, until you press ^C or similar).

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--line-output</b>, <b>--linearize</b>
              Marshalls  the  program's output line-by-line, avoiding mix-ups with <b>topline</b>'s data.  They will be
              interspersed in separate lines.
              The program will know it is being piped; if you want it to believe it's ran on a terminal (to  get
              colors, etc) you may use a tool like <b>pipetty</b>.

       <b>-i</b> <u>&lt;interval&gt;</u>
              Sets the interval between data samples; the default is 1s.  Floating-point values are allowed; the
              number  may  be suffixed by a "s" (seconds, default), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours), "d" (days), "ms"
              (milliseconds), "us" or "Âµs" (microseconds).

       <b>-o</b> <u>&lt;file&gt;</u>, <b>--output</b> <u>&lt;file&gt;</u>
              Redirects <b>topline</b>'s output to the given file.  The program being  ran  can  then  use  stdout  and
              stderr unimpeded.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       If  the  machine's  CPUs  are  hyperthreaded  with more than one or two per core, the graph won't make it
       obvious which columns share a core.  All siblings are  still  given  consecutively,  unless  forced  into
       separate NUMA nodes with fakenuma settings.

       Machines above 140-150 CPUs may not fit on an 80-column terminal.
