       pnmpad - add borders to a PNM image

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pnmpad</b>  [<b>-color=</b><u>color</u>  [<b>-promote=</b>{<b>none</b>|<b>format</b>|<b>all</b>}]  |<b>-detect-background</b>  |<b>-extend-edge</b> |<b>-white</b> |<b>-black</b> ]
       [<b>-width=</b><u>pixels</u>]  [<b>-halign=</b><u>ratio</u>]   [<b>-mwidth=</b><u>pixels</u>]   [<b>-left=</b><u>pixels</u>]   [<b>-right=</b><u>pixels</u>]   [<b>-height=</b><u>pixels</u>]
       [<b>-valign=</b><u>ratio</u>] [<b>-mheight=</b><u>pixels</u>] [<b>-top=</b><u>pixels</u>] [<b>-bottom=</b><u>pixels</u>] [<b>-reportonly</b>] [<b>-verbose</b>] [<u>pnmfile</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program is part of <b><a href="../man1/Netpbm.1.html">Netpbm</a></b>(1).

       <b>pnmpad</b>  reads a Netpbm image as input and outputs a PNM image that is the input image plus borders of the
       color and sizes specified.

       You can use <b>pamcomp</b> to add borders of any content - solid color,
         pattern, or whatever.  For example, if you wanted to add 10 pixels of
         rainbow borders to the top and bottom of a 100x100 image, you could create a
         100x120 rainbow image (e.g. with <b>ppmrainbow</b>) and then
         use <b>pamcomp</b> to insert your 100x100 image into the center of it.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most notably  <b>-quiet</b>,  see   Common
       Options ), <b>pnmpad</b> recognizes the following command line options:

       All  options  can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.  You may use two hyphens instead of one
       to designate an option.  You may use either white space or an equals sign between an option name and  its
       value.

       <b>-color=</b><u>color</u>

       <b>-detect-background</b>

       <b>-extend-edge</b>

       <b>-white</b>

       <b>-black</b> This  specifies  the  color  of  the  padding.  <u>color</u> is like the argument of the <b>pnm_parsecolor()</b>
              library routine .

              <b>-detect-background</b> means the program uses the color of the top left pixel of the input as the  pad
              color.  Note that this could cause odd results if you aren't padding the top or left of the image.

              You may specify only one of <b>-white</b>, <b>-black</b>, <b>-color</b>, and <b>-detect-background</b>.

              <b>-extend-edge</b>  says  to  pad by duplicating the adjacent edge of the image pixel by pixel.  E.g. if
              the top row of the image is 20 white pixels followed by 10 black  pixels,  every  row  of  padding
              added to the top of the image is 20 white pixels followed by 20 black pixels.

              By default, the padding is black.

              <b>-white</b>  and  <b>-black</b>  are for backward compatibility.  <b>-color</b>, <b>-detect-background</b>, and <b>-extend-edge</b>
              were new with Netpbm 11.05 (December 2023).

       <b>-left=</b><u>pixels</u>

       <b>-right=</b><u>pixels</u>

       <b>-width=</b><u>width</u>

       <b>-halign=</b><u>ratio</u>

       <b>-mwidth=</b><u>pixels</u>
              Specify amount of left and right padding in pixels.

              <b>-left</b> and <b>-right</b> directly specify the amount of  padding  added  to  the  left  and  right  sides,
              respectively, of the image.

              Alternatively,  you  can specify <b>-width</b> and just one of <b>-left</b> and <b>-right</b> and <b>pnmpad</b> calculates the
              required padding on the other side to make the output <u>width</u> pixels wide.  If the <b>-width</b>  value  is
              less than the width of the input image plus the specified padding, <b>pnmpad</b> ignores <b>-width</b>.

              If  you  specify all three of <b>-width</b>, <b>-left</b>, and <b>-right</b>, you must ensure that the <b>-left</b> and <b>-right</b>
              padding are sufficient to make the image at least as wide as <b>-width</b> specifies, and  in  that  case
              <b>-width</b> has no effect on the output.  Otherwise, <b>pnmpad</b> fails.

              When you specify <b>-width</b> without <b>-left</b> or <b>-right</b>, and <b>-width</b> is larger than the input image, <b>pnmpad</b>
              chooses  left  and right padding amounts in a certain ratio.  That ratio defaults to half, but you
              can set it to anything (from 0 to 1) with the <b>-halign</b> option.  If the input image  is  already  at
              least as wide as <b>-width</b> specifies, <b>pnmpad</b> adds no padding.

              Common values for <b>-halign</b> are:

       <b>0.0</b>    left aligned

       <b>0.5</b>    center aligned (default)

       <b>1.0</b>    right aligned

              <b>-mwidth=</b><u>pixels</u> says to pad to a multiple of <u>pixels</u> pixels.  E.g. if <u>pixels</u> is 10, the output image
              width  will  be a multiple of 10 pixels.  <b>pnmpad</b> adds to whatever padding the other options say to
              do to get to this multiple.  It divides that padding between the left and right sides of the image
              to maintain the ratio the other options produce.  E.g. if you say  <b>-left=10</b>  <b>-right=10</b>  <b>-mwidth=50</b>
              with  a  100-pixel  image,  you  end up with a 150-pixel image with the extra padding split evenly
              between left and right for a total of 25 pixels of padding on the left and 25 on  the  right.   If
              the  other  options indicate no padding, <b>pnmpad</b> adds padding in the ratio specified by <b>-halign</b> and
              if <b>-halign</b> is not specified, equally on both sides.

              Before Netpbm 10.97 (December 2021), <b>pnmpad</b> does not allow <b>-halign</b> with <b>-mwidth</b> and  adds  padding
              only on the right when <b>-mwidth</b> is specified and the other options indicate no padding.

              Before Netpbm 10.72 (September 2015), there is no <b>-mwidth</b>.

              Before  Netpbm  10.23  (July  2004), <b>pnmpad</b> did not allow the <b>-left</b> or <b>-right</b> option together with
              <b>-width</b>.

       <b>-top=</b><u>pixels</u>

       <b>-bottom=</b><u>pixels</u>

       <b>-height=</b><u>height</u>

       <b>-valign=</b><u>ratio</u>

       <b>-mheight=</b><u>pixels</u>
              These options determine the vertical padding.   They  are  analogous  to  the  horizontal  padding
              options above.

       <b>-promote=</b>{<b>none</b>|<b>format</b>|<b>all</b>}
              This  option  tells what to do when the <b>-color</b> option specifies a color that cannot be represented
              in the input format, which ordinarily is also the output format.  For example, if the input is PGM
              (which can represent only shades of gray), and you specify  <b>-color=red</b>,  should  <b>pnmpad</b>  make  the
              padding gray or make the output PPM?

       <b>none</b>

              Make the output have the same format and maxval as the input.
                    Adjust the pad color to the nearest color possible in that format
                    (black, white, or a shade of gray).

       <b>format</b>

              Make the output have the same maxval as the input, but make
                    the output format PPM if the pad color is not black, white, or gray.

       <b>all</b>

              Make the format and maxval of the output capable of representing the
                    pad color.  Make the format the least expressive format capable of
                    representing the pad color.  Make the maxval the larger of 255 and
                    the maxval of the input image.

              The default is <b>-promote=all</b>.

              Note  that  this  promotion  happens  even  if  no actual padding happens, meaning it isn't really
              necessary.  The promotion is based on what <u>would</u> be required to represent padding of the specified
              color.

              This option is valid only when you also specify <b>-color</b>.

              This option was new in Netpbm 11.05 (December 2023).

       <b>-reportonly</b>
                This causes <b>pnmpad</b> to write to Standard Output a description of the
                padding it would have done instead of producing an output image.  See

              below  for a description of this output and ways
                to use it.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.89 (December 2019).

       <b>-verbose</b>
              This causes verbose messages.

</pre><h4><b>REPORT</b> <b>ONLY</b></h4><pre>
       When you specify <b>-reportonly</b>, <b>pnmpad</b> does not produce an
         output image.  Instead, it writes to Standard Output a description of the
         padding it would have done without <b>-reportonly</b>.

       That description is one line of text, containing 6 decimal numbers of
         pixels, separated by spaces:

       •      left padding

       •      right padding

       •      top padding

       •      bottom padding

       •      output width

       •      output height

       Example:

             4 3 0 2 100 100

       One use for this is to make padding which is fancier than the black and
         white that <b>pnmpad</b> can do.

       In the following example, we pad an image with 10 pixels of gray all
         around, without knowing the original image dimensions beforehand.  We do
         this by generating a gray image with <b>pbmmake</b> and then pasting the
         subject image into the middle of it.

       The example uses shell arrays, such as exist in Bash, but not Dash.

           pad=($(pnmpad -reportonly -left=10 -right=10 -top=10 -bottom=10 input.ppm))
           pbmmake -gray ${pad[4]} ${pad[5]} | \
             pnmpaste input.ppm ${pad[0]} ${pad[2]} -

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The command line syntax was originally more of a traditional Unix syntax,
         with single-character margin size options <b>-l</b>, <b>-r</b>, <b>-t</b>,
         and <b>-b</b> that took arguments concatenated to the option name, such
         as <b>-l50</b>.  This is in contrast to the more modern syntax used by
         essentially all Netpbm programs, in which an option such as <b>-left</b>
         (which can still be abbreviated <b>-l</b>) must have its name and value as
         separate command line arguments (e.g. <b>-l</b> <b>50</b>).

         The new syntax was accepted and the old syntax deprecated and removed from
         documentation in Netpbm 9.25 (March 2002), and was no longer accepted in
         Netpbm 11.05 (December 2023).

         The code was broken for most of that time so that an attempt to use the old
         syntax would fail anyway.  The bug was discovered only in testing; no user
         ever reported encountering it.
