</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program is part of <b><a href="../man1/Netpbm.1.html">Netpbm</a></b>(1).

       <b>pamstereogram</b>  inputs  a  depth  map  (a map of the distances from your eye of the points in a scene) and
       outputs a single-image stereogram (SIS). A SIS  is  a  2-D  image  specially  designed  to  appear  three
       dimensional  when  viewed  with  relaxed,  slightly  unfocused  eyes.  What's exciting about single-image
       stereograms is that they don't require special glasses to  view,  although  it  does  require  a  bit  of
       practice  to train your eyes to unfocus properly.  The <b>pamstereogram</b> program provides a wealth of control
       over how the stereogram is generated, including the following:

       •      black and white, grayscale, or color output

       •      single-image random-dot stereograms (SIRDS), single-image stereograms (SIS) using a  tiled  image,
              or mapped-texture stereograms (MTS)

       •      images targeting a given device resolution and eye separation

       •      optional guide boxes to assist in focusing

       •      the ability to trade off depth levels for easier viewing

       •      choice of wall-eyed or cross-eyed stereograms

       The  output is a PAM image on standard output.  Options control the exact format of the PAM.  If you want
       a PNM (PBM, PGM, or PPM) image, use <b>pamtopnm</b> on the output.  There is no need to convert if you will  use
       the image as input to a current Netpbm program, but many other programs don't know what a PAM is.

       To make a red/cyan type of stereogram (that you view with 3-D glasses) instead, see <b>ppm3d</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       You  may  use  either  single  or  double hyphens to denote options.  You may use either whitespace or an
       equals sign to separate an option name from its value.

       In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most notably  <b>-quiet</b>,  see   Common
       Options ), <b>pamstereogram</b> recognizes the following command line options:

       <b>-verbose</b>
              Display messages about image sizes and formats and properties of the stereogram being generated.

       <b>-blackandwhite</b>
              Produce a single-image random-dot black-and-white stereogram.  This is the default.

       <b>-grayscale</b>
              Produce a single-image random-dot grayscale stereogram.

       <b>-color</b> Produce a single-image random-dot color stereogram.

       <b>-maxval=</b><u>value</u>
              Designate  the  maximum  value  of  each gray/color component, i.e.  the color resolution. Smaller
              values make the output image have smaller numbers of unique grays/colors.  If  you  don't  specify
              <b>-maxval</b>,  <b>pamstereogram</b>  uses  the  maxval  of  the  input  image.  This option has no effect with
              <b>-blackandwhite</b>.

       <b>-patfile=</b><u>pamfile</u>
              Specify an image to use as a repeated background pattern for the stereogram instead of  a  random-
              dot  pattern.  Intricate  images  generally  produce a crisper 3-D effect that simpler images. The
              output file will have the same maxval and format (black and white,  grayscale  or  color)  as  the
              pattern  file.  You  cannot  specify  the  <b>-patfile</b>  option along with <b>-blackandwhite</b>, <b>-grayscale</b>,
              <b>-color</b>, or <b>-maxval</b>.  The <b>-verbose</b> option will give you information on the ideal dimensions of  the
              pattern file.

       <b>-xbegin=</b><u>pixels</u>
              Specify the horizontal coordinate at which to begin stereogram generation.  The background pattern
              will be minimally distorted at this point and more distorted at greater distances.  Consider using
              this  in conjunction with <b>-xshift</b> to align the horizontal start of the pattern with the horizontal
              start of  stereogram  generation.  <b>-xbegin</b>  is  meaningful  only  in  conjunction  with  <b>-patfile</b>,
              <b>-makemask</b>,  or  <b>-texfile</b>,  and <b>pamstereogram</b> actually ignores it with respect to <b>-texfile</b> (but may
              not in a future version of <b>pamstereogram</b>).

              The default is to begin in the center.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.71 (June 2015).

       <b>-texfile=</b><u>pamfile</u>
              Specify an image to use as the texture for a mapped-texture stereogram.   The  idea  is  that  the
              depth-map image provides the depth values of the 3-D object/scene while the texture image provides
              the  true-color  values.   Consequently,  the texture image should align with the depth-map image.
              (Note that it's required to have the same dimensions.)  The texture image's  background  color  is
              ignored when blending colors.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.53 (December 2010).

       <b>-bgcolor=</b><u>color</u>
              Use  <u>color</u>  as  the texture image's background color instead of letting <b>pamstereogram</b> determine it
              automatically.  Specify the color as described  for  the  argument of the pnm_parsecolor() library
              routine .  The <b>-bgcolor</b> option is meaningful only in conjunction with <b>-texfile</b>.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.53 (December 2010).

       <b>-smoothing=</b><u>pixels</u>
              When used without <b>-texfile</b>, attempt to eliminate artifacts introduced by edges in the depth map if
              <u>pixels</u> is greater than zero.

              When  used  with  <b>-texfile</b>, horizontally blur non-background colors into background pixels up to a
              distance of <u>pixels</u> pixels.   This  helps  smooth  over  distracting  glitches  introduced  by  the
              stereogram's  color  constraints  when  producing  a mapped-texture stereogram.  In this case, the
              <b>-smoothing</b> option is helpful when the texture image includes smooth color  transitions  (as  in  a
              photograph) but makes crisp texture images (as in a line drawing) appear blurry.

              This  option was new in Netpbm 10.53 (December 2010).  Before Netpbm 10.61 (December 2012), it has
              no effect without <b>-texfile</b>.

       <b>-xshift=</b><u>pixels</u>
              Shift the pattern image (designated by <b>-patfile</b>) to the right by <u>pixels</u> pixels (default: 0).

              This option is valid only along with <b>-patfile</b>.

       <b>-yshift</b> <u>pixels</u>
              Shift the pattern image (designated by <b>-patfile</b>) downwards by <u>pixels</u>  pixels  (default:  0).  This
              option is valid only along with <b>-patfile</b>.

       <b>-yfillshift</b> <u>pixels</u>
              Shift  the pattern image (designated by <b>-patfile</b>) downwards by <u>pixels</u> pixels (default: 0) but only
              after the initial population of the pattern.  (If used  with  <b>-yshift</b>  the  resulting  shifts  are
              summed.)   A  small  <b>-yfillshift</b> helps reduce visual artifacts in the 3-D image.  Steer's website,
              referenced  under  SEE ALSO  ,  recommends  a  shift  of  approximately  1/16"  (6-7   pixels   at
              <b>pamstereogram</b>'s default of 100 DPI).

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.94 (March 2021).

       <b>-magnifypat=</b><u>scale</u>
              Magnify  each  pixel in the pattern file or each random dot by integral scaling factor <u>scale</u>. Note
              that <b>pamstereogram</b> applies the pattern magnification <u>after</u> pattern shifting (<b>-xshift</b> and <b>-yshift</b>).

       <b>-guidebottom</b>
              Draw a pair of black squares on a white background underneath the stereogram proper. These squares
              help you guide your eyes into proper focus to view the 3-D image.  The trick is to focus your eyes
              some distance behind the image, causing you to see four black squares, then continue altering your
              focus distance until the middle two black squares fuse into a single black square. At that  point,
              a crisp, 3-D image will appear.

              This  option  was  new  in Netpbm 10.61 (December 2012).  Before that, the presence of <b>-guidesize</b>,
              with a positive value, has the same effect.

       <b>-guidetop</b>
              Same as <b>-guidebottom</b>, except the guides go at the top of the image.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.61 (December 2012).  Before that,  the  presence  of  <b>-guidesize</b>,
              with a negative value, has the same effect.

       <b>-guidesize=</b><u>pixels</u>
              The size (width and height) of each guide box.

              This is valid only with <b>-guidetop</b> or <b>-guidebottom</b>.

              Default is 20.

              Before  Netpbm  10.61  (December  2012),  if you don't specify this option, <b>pamstereogram</b> draws no
              guides.  If you specify it with a positive  value,  <b>pamstereogram</b>  behaves  as  if  you  specified
              <b>-guidebottom</b>  too,  and  if  you  specify it with a negative value, it behaves as if you specified
              <b>-guidetop</b> and specified <b>guidesize</b> with the absolute value of that negative value.

       <b>-dpi=</b><u>resolution</u>
              Specify the resolution of the output device in dots per inch.   The  default  is  100  DPI,  which
              represents a fairly crisp screen resolution.

              Before Netpbm 10.53 (December 2010), the default was 96 DPI.

       <b>-crosseyed</b>
              Invert  the  gray levels in the depth map (input image) so that the 3-D image pops out of the page
              where it would otherwise sink into the page and vice versa. Some  people  are  unable  to  diverge
              their eyes and can only cross them. The <b>-crosseyed</b> option enables such people to see the 3-D image
              as  intended.   You can also specify the <b>-crosseyed</b> option if you prefer using depth maps in which
              darker colors are closer to the eye and lighter colors are farther from the eye.

              Before Netpbm 10.53 (December 2010), <b>pamstereogram</b> used higher (lighter) numbers for things closer
              to the eye <u>without</u> <b>-crosseyed</b> and vice versa.

       <b>-makemask</b>
              Instead of a stereogram, output a PAM mask image showing coloring constraints. New pixels will  be
              taken  from the pattern file where the mask is black. Copies of existing pixels will be taken from
              the pattern file where the mask is white. The <b>-makemask</b> option can be used  to  help  create  more
              sophisticated  pattern  files  (to  use with <b>-patfile</b>) Note that <b>-makemask</b> ignores <b>-magnifypat</b>; it
              always produces masks that assume a pattern magnification of 1.

       <b>-eyesep=</b><u>inches</u>
              Specify the separation in inches between your eyes. The default, 2.5 inches (6.4  cm),  should  be
              sufficient for most people and probably doesn't need to be changed.

       <b>-depth=</b><u>fraction</u>
              Specify the output image's depth of field. That is, <u>fraction</u> represents the fractional distance of
              the  near  plane  from  the  far  plane. Smaller numbers make the 3-D image easier to perceive but
              flatter. Larger numbers make the 3-D image more difficult to perceive  but  deeper.  The  default,
              0.3333, generally works fairly well.

       <b>-planes=</b><u>near_pixels</u>,<u>far_pixels</u>
              Explicitly  specify  the  distance between repeated pixels in the near plane and in the far plane.
              This is an alternative to <b>-eyesep</b> and <b>-depth</b>.  The following equalities hold:

       •      <u>eyesep</u> = 2 * <u>far</u>

       •      <u>depth</u> = 2 * (<u>far</u> - <u>near</u>) /
                    (2 * <u>far</u> - <u>near</u>)

              The number of distinct 3-D depths is <u>far</u> - <u>near</u> + 1.  One might say that <b>-eyesep</b> and <b>-depth</b> are  a
              more  human-friendly  way  to  specify stereoscopic parameters (distance between eyes and tradeoff
              between perceptibility and depth) while <b>-planes</b> is a more computer-centric way (pixel distances in
              the resulting stereogram).

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.59 (June 2012).

       <b>-randomseed=</b><u>integer</u>
              Specify a seed to be used for the random number generator.  The default is to use a seed based  on
              the time of day, to one second granularity.

              It is useful to specify the seed if you want to create reproducible results.  With the same random
              seed, you should get identical results every time you run <b>pamstereogram</b>.

              This is irrelevant if you use a pattern file (<b>-patfile</b> option), because there is no random element
              to <b>pamstereogram</b>'s behavior.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.32 (February 2006).

       <b>-tileable</b>
              Make  the generated image horizontally tileable.  This works by blending a left-to-right rendering
              (the equivalent of <b>-xbegin</b>=0) with a right-to-left rendering (the equivalent of <b>-xbegin</b>=<u>width-1</u>).

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.91 (June 2020).

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       The only parameter, <u>infile</u>, is the name of an input file that is a depth map image. If you don't  specify
       <u>infile</u>, the input is from standard input.

       The  input is a PAM image of depth 1. Each sample represents the distance from the eye that the 3-D image
       at that location should be.  Lower (darker) numbers mean further from the eye.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Input</b> <b>Images</b>
       <b>pamstereogram</b> pays no attention to the image's tuple type and ignores all planes other than plane 0.

       Like any Netpbm program, <b>pamstereogram</b> will accept PNM input as if it were the PAM equivalent.

   <b>Mapped-texture</b> <b>Stereograms</b>
       In a <u>mapped-texture</u> <u>stereogram</u> (MTS), the 3-D image can be drawn with true colors.   Unlike  a  SIRDS  or
       tiled-image  SIS,  however,  the image portrayed by an MTS is apparent in normal 2-D viewing.  It appears
       repeated multiple times and overlapped with itself, but it is not hidden.

       You create an MTS with <b>pamstereogram</b> by passing the filename of a PAM "texture  image"  with  a  <b>-texfile</b>
       option.   A  texture  image  portrays the same 3-D object as the depth-map image but indicates the colors
       that the program should apply to the object.

       <b>pamstereogram</b> ignores the texture image's background color when it overlaps copies  of  the  3-D  object.
       This  prevents,  for  example,  a  bright-red object on a black background from being drawn as a dark-red
       object (a blend of 50% bright red and 50% black); instead, the program ignores the black and  the  object
       remains  bright  red.   A  consequence  of this feature is that an MTS looks best when the objects in the
       texture image have a crisp outline.  Smooth transitions to the background color result in unwanted  color
       artifacts around edges because the program ignores only <u>exact</u> matches with the background color.

       You  should  specify  a  larger-than-normal  value  for  <b>-eyesep</b>  (and/or  <b>-dpi</b>)  when  producing an MTS.
       Otherwise, the 3-D object will repeat so many times that most colored pixels will overlap  other  colored
       pixels, reducing the number of true-colored pixels that remain.

       An  MTS  can  employ  a  background  pattern (<b>-patfile</b>).  In this case, <b>pamstereogram</b> replaces background
       pixels with pattern pixels in the final step of generating the image.

   <b>Miscellaneous</b>
       A good initial test is to input an image consisting of a solid shape of distance 0 within a  large  field
       of maximum distance (e.g., a white square on a black background).

       With  the  default  values  for  <b>-dpi</b>  and  <b>-eyesep</b>,  pattern  images  that  are 128 pixels wide can tile
       seamlessly.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Generate a SIRDS out of small, brightly colored squares and prepare it for display on an 87 DPI monitor:

           pamstereogram depthmap.pam \
               -dpi 87 -verbose -color -maxval 1 -magnifypat 3 \
               &gt;3d.pam

       Generate a SIS by tiling a PPM file (a prior run with <b>-verbose</b> indicates how wide the pattern file should
       be for seamless tiling, although any width is acceptable for producing SISes):

           pamstereogram depthmap.pam -patfile mypattern.ppm &gt;3d.pam

       Generate an MTS by associating colors with a depth-mapped object (using a large eye separation to  reduce
       the number of repetitions of the texture image) and twice smoothing over background-colored speckles:

           pamstereogram depthmap.pam \
               -texfile colormap.pam -smoothing 2 -eyesep 3.5 \
               &gt;3d.pam

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pamstereogram</b>  was  new  in  Netpbm 10.22 (April 2004), but probably broken beyond usability until Netpbm
       10.32 (February 2006) and Netpbm 10.26.23 (January 2006).

       A backward incompatible change to the way you request guide boxes  (<b>-guidetop</b>,  <b>-guidebottom</b>,  <b>-guidesize</b>
       happened in Netpbm 10.61 (December 2012).
