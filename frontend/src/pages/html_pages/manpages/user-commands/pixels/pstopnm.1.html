</pre><h4><b>OPTION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable.  You may use double hyphens instead of single hyphen
       to  denote  options.  You may use white space in place of the equals sign to separate an option name from
       its value.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program is part of <b><a href="../man1/Netpbm.1.html">Netpbm</a></b>(1).

       <b>pstopnm</b> reads a PostScript or PDF file as input and produces PBM, PGM, or PPM  images  as  output.   This
       program  simply  uses  GhostScript to render a PostScript file with its PNM device drivers.  If you don't
       have GhostScript installed or the version you have installed was not built with the relevant  PNM  device
       drivers,  <b>pstopnm</b>  will  fail.   You can see if you have the proper environment by issuing the command gs
       --help .  If it responds and lists under "Available Devices" <b>pbm</b>, <b>pbmraw</b>, <b>pgm</b>, <b>pgmraw</b>, <b>pnm</b>, <b>pnmraw</b>,  <b>ppm</b>,
       or <b>ppmraw</b>, you're in business.

       It's  important  to  understand that <b>pstopnm</b> is a Netpbm image file format converter only in the broadest
       sense of the word, because Postscript is far from an image file format.  What  <b>pstopnm</b>  really  is  is  a
       Postscript  renderer  -  an  image generator.  One place you'll notice the difference is where you expect
       pstopnm | pnmtops to be idempotent (which is not the case).  There are details on this kind of conversion
       below.

       <b>pstopnm</b> uses the value of the <b>GHOSTSCRIPT</b> environment variable as  the  file  name  for  the  Ghostscript
       program.   If  <b>GHOSTSCRIPT</b>  is  not  set,  <b>pstopnm</b> searches your <b>PATH</b> for a regular file named <b>gs</b>.  If it
       doesn't find one, it assumes Ghostscript is in the file <b>/usr/bin/gs</b>.

       <b>pstopnm</b> does not use the Netpbm libraries to generate the output files, so may not be entirely consistent
       with most Netpbm programs.

       <u>psfile</u>[<b>.ps</b>] is the name of the input file.  <b>pstopnm</b> will add the <b>ps</b> to the end of the name you specify if
       no file exists by the exact name you specify, but one with <b>.ps</b>added does.  For Standard Input, use  <b>-</b>  or
       just don't give any argument.

       If  you  use  the <b>-stdout</b>  option or your input is from Standard Input, <b>pstopnm</b> outputs images of all the
       pages as a multi-image file to Standard Output.  Otherwise, <b>pstopnm</b> creates one file for each page in the
       Postscript input.  The files are named as follows: If the input file is named <b>psfile.ps</b>, the name of  the
       files  will  be <b>psfile001.ppm</b>, <b>psfile002.ppm</b>, etc.  The filetype suffix is <b>.ppm</b>, <b>.pgm</b>, or <b>.pbm</b>, depending
       on which kind of output you choose with your invocation options.  If the input file name does not end  in
       <b>.ps</b>,  the  whole  file  name  is  used  in the output file name.  For example, if the input file is named
       <b>psfile.old</b>, the output file name is <b>psfile.old001.ppm</b>, etc.

       Note that the output file selection is inconsistent with  most  Netpbm  programs,  because  it  does  not
       default  to  Standard  Output.  This is for historical reasons, based on the fact that the Netpbm formats
       did not always provide for a sequence of images in a single file.

       When your input is from Standard Input, you may feed  multiple  Encapsulated  Postscript  documents,  one
       after  another,  and  <b>pstopnm</b>  converts  every document and places it in the Standard Output stream as an
       image.  But if your input is from a named file, <b>pstopnm</b> expects the file to be an Encapsulated Postscript
       file, which means it contains only one Enapsulated Postscript document.  If the  file  contains  multiple
       concatenated  documents,  <b>pstopnm</b>  ignores every document but the first.  This distinction does not exist
       for non-EPSF Postscript input - <b>pstopnm</b> generates an output image for each page of the  input  regardless
       of whether the input is from Standard Input or from a named file.

       Note  that  you  can  generate  both  kinds  of  files - concatenated EPSF and multi-page non-EPSF - with
       <b>pnmtops</b>, selecting with the <b>-setpage</b> option.

       Each output image contains a rectangular area of the page  to  which  it  pertains.   See  the Dimensions
       section   for details on what part of the input image goes into the output image and how big it is in the
       output and what borders and margins are in the output image.

       It has been reported that on some  Postscript  Version  1  input,  Ghostscript,  and  therefore  <b>pstopnm</b>,
       produces  no  output.   To  solve this problem, you can convert the file to Postscript Version 3 with the
       program <b>ps2ps</b>.  It is reported that the program <b>pstops</b> does not work.

   <b>Dimensions</b>
       This section describes what part of the input image gets used in the output and  the  dimensions  of  the
       output, including borders and background.

       Note that an output image is associated with a single input page.

       <b>pstopnm</b> starts by taking a rectangular area from the input page.  That is called the subject image.

       <b>pstopnm</b> may add borders to the subject image to form what is called the bordered subject image.

       <b>pstopnm</b>  places  the  bordered  subject  image  in  the center of the output image and clips the edges as
       necessary to fit the computed output image size.

       The location of the subject image in the Postscript input page is defined by four numbers, the lower left
       corner and the upper right corner x and y coordinates.  These coordinates are usually  specified  by  the
       BoundingBox  DSC  statement  (a Postscript comment) in the PostScript file, but they can be overridden by
       the user by specifying one or more of the following options: <b>-llx</b>, <b>-lly</b>, <b>-urx</b>, and <b>-ury</b>.

       The presence and thickness of a border to be added to the subject image  to  form  the  bordered  subject
       image  is  controlled  by  the  options  <b>-xborder</b>  and  <b>-yborder</b>.  If <b>pstopnm</b> does not find a BoundingBox
       statement in the input, and you don't specify image area coordinates on the command  line,  <b>pstopnm</b>  uses
       default  values.   If  your  input  is  from  Standard Input, <b>pstopnm</b> does not use the BoundingBox values
       (because of the technical difficulty of extracting  that  information  and  still  feeding  the  file  to
       Ghostscript), so you either have to specify the image area coordinates or take the default.

       The  output  image size is a confusing thing.  In a Postscript file, things have spatial dimensions.  For
       example, a particular line may be 3 centimeters long.  A Postscript printer is supposed to print the line
       3 centimeters long, using however many pixels that takes, without regard to how big the sheet of paper on
       which it is printing is.  In a PNM image, by contrast, there is no  spatial  dimension;  there  are  only
       pixels.   You  might  have  a line that is 100 pixels long, but the PNM image says nothing about how long
       that line should be on a printed page.

       <b>pstopnm</b> fills the role of a Postscript printer.  The PNM image is a virtual printed page.   <b>pstopnm</b>  must
       determine  how  many pixels it will use in the output image to represent an inch of input image, which is
       the "output device resolution."  Think of it as the number of dots per inch the virtual printer prints on
       the virtual page.

       The simplest thing is for you to tell <b>pstopnm</b> exactly what output device resolution  to  use,  using  the
       <b>-dpi</b> option.  If you say for example <b>-dpi=300</b> and the bordered subject image is 2 inches by 3 inches, the
       PNM  output  will be 600 pixels by 900 pixels.  Using this method, the output device resolution has to be
       the same in both directions.

       Or you can set the output image dimensions with <b>-xsize</b> and <b>-ysize</b>.  For example, if you  say  <b>-xsize=1200</b>
       <b>-ysize=1800</b> and the bordered subject image is 2 inches wide by 3 inches high, the output image is 1200 by
       1800 pixels, with each pixel representing 1/600 inch of input image.

       In  the unlikely event that you want different output device resolutions in the two directions, you could
       use <b>-xsize</b> and <b>-ysize</b> to do that.  In the above example, if you change  <b>-ysize</b>  to  900,  a  pixel  still
       represents 1/600 inch horizontally, but 1/300 inch vertically.

       If  you  specify  one  of  <b>-xsize</b>  and <b>-ysize</b> and not the other, <b>pstopnm</b> defaults the other such that the
       output device resolution is the same in both directions.

       The "x" and "y" of <b>-xsize</b> and <b>-ysize</b> refer to the image being printed on the page, not the page.   So  if
       <b>pstopnm</b> prints it in landscape orientation, "x" would pertain to the vertical direction on the page, i.e.
       the vertical direction in the output PNM image.

       If  you  specify  neither  the  output  size  nor  the  output device resolution, <b>pstopnm</b> does some weird
       computation which exists mainly for historical reasons:

       If you specify <b>-nocrop</b>, <b>pstopnm</b> uses the values of <b>-xmax</b> and  <b>-ymax</b>  for  the  output  image  dimensions.
       These default to 612 and 792 pixels, respectively.

       The  final case, the default, is where you don't specify any size or resolution options or <b>-nocrop</b>.  This
       is the most complicated case.  In this case, <b>pstopnm</b> first chooses an output device resolution that would
       generate the number of pixels indicated by <b>-xmax</b> and <b>-ymax</b> from the bordered subject image.  Then,  based
       on  that resolution, it chooses an output image size that is just large enough to accommodate the subject
       image (no borders).  Remember (above) that <b>pstopnm</b> trims the edges of the bordered subject image  to  fit
       the computed output size.

   <b>Ghostscript</b> <b>Limitations</b>
       Tests  done  in 2013 with Ghostscript 8.71 indicate that Ghostscript's <b>pgmraw</b> output driver has some kind
       of rounding error that causes the pixel values to change  slightly,  and  that  means  <b>pstopnm</b>  generates
       incorrect  output  when  you  have monochrome Postscript input.  But with color Postscript input, <b>pstopnm</b>
       uses Ghostscript's <b>ppmraw</b> output driver and generates correct PPM output.

   <b>Usage</b> <b>Notes</b>
       There is some good advice on converting  to  and  from  Postscript,  in  the  document    Postcript  File
       Conversions" (1) by Andrew T. Young.

       <b>Reversible</b> <b>Conversion</b>

       If you're trying to do the equivalent of the naive pnmtops | pstopnm, the following steps will do it.

           $ pnmtops -nocenter -equalpixels -dpi 72 -noturn testimg.ppm &gt; testimg.ps
           $ pstopnm -xborder=0 -yborder=0 -xsize=<u>XSIZE</u> -ysize=<u>YSIZE</u> \
               -portrait -stdout -quiet testimg.ps &gt;testimg2.ppm

       <u>XSIZE</u>  <u>and</u>  <u>YSIZE</u> <u>above</u> <u>are</u> <u>the</u> <u>image</u> <u>dimensions,</u> <u>which</u> <u>you</u> <u>can</u> <u>get</u> <u>from</u> <u>testimg.ps</u> <u>like</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>following</u>
       <u>example</u> <u>(the</u> <u>grep,</u> <u>awk</u> <u>and</u> <u>echo</u> <u>commands</u> <u>are</u> <u>just</u> <u>to</u> <u>help</u> <u>demonstrate</u> <u>how</u> <u>the</u> <u>other</u> <u>commands</u> <u>work</u>  <u>-</u>  <u>you</u>
       <u>wouldn't</u> <u>use</u> <u>those</u> <u>in</u> <u>a</u> <u>program).</u>

           $ grep "BoundingBox" testimg.ps
           %%BoundingBox: 0 0 227 149

           $ awk  '/%%BoundingBox/ {print $4,$5}' testimg.ps
            227 149

           $ xysize=$(awk  '/%%BoundingBox/ {print "-xsize="$4,"-ysize="$5}' testimg.ps)
           $ echo $xysize

            -xsize=227 -ysize=149

           $ pstopnm -xborder=0 -yborder=0 $xysize -portrait ... testimg.ps

       Note that Ghostscript bugs can keep this from doing a perfect reversible conversion.

       PDF  is  a subset of Postscript, so <b>pstopnm</b> can convert from PDF to Netpbm format, but often produces the
       wrong size image because of <b>pstopnm</b>'s reliance on a BoundingBox DSC statement, which PDF does  not  have.
       With  pure text PDFs, it works fine.  In other cases, you can get better results by converting to general
       Postscript with the <b>pdf2ps</b> program that comes with Ghostscript.  For more information about converting to
       and from PDF, see Document/Graphics Software .

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most notably  <b>-quiet</b>,  see   Common
       Options ), <b>pstopnm</b> recognizes the following command line options:

       <b>-forceplain</b>
               forces  the  output  file to be in plain (text) format.  Otherwise, it is in raw (binary) format.
              See <b><a href="../man1/pbm.1.html">pbm</a></b>(1), etc.  Use this instead of the <b>-plain</b> common option if you need plain format output.

       <b>-llx=</b><u>bx</u>
              selects <u>bx</u> as the lower left corner x coordinate (in inches) on the Postscript input page  of  the
              subject image.  See the Dimensions section .

       <b>-lly=</b><u>by</u>
              selects  <u>by</u>  as the lower left corner y coordinate (in inches) on the Postscript input page of the
              subject image.  See the Dimensions section .

       <b>-landscape</b>
              renders the image in landscape orientation.

              If you specify neither <b>-portrait</b> nor <b>-landscape</b>, <b>pstopnm</b> chooses the orientation  that  best  fits
              the image on the output page.

              Landscape  means  printed  sideways  on  the  page, not printed the long way.  Those are different
              things if the long edge of the page is the top one.

       <b>-portrait</b>
              renders the image in portrait orientation.

              See <b>-landscape</b>.

       <b>-nocrop</b>
              This option causes <b>pstopnm</b> to make the output image exactly the dimensions of the bordered subject
              image.  By default, <b>pstopnm</b> makes the output image the dimensions specified by  <b>-xmax</b>  and  <b>-ymax</b>.
              See the Dimensions section .

       <b>-pbm</b>

       <b>-pgm</b>

       <b>-ppm</b>   selects the format of the output file.  By default, all files are rendered as PPM.

       <b>-stdout</b>
              causes  output to go to Standard Output instead of to regular files, one per page (see description
              of output files above).  Use <b>pnmsplit</b> to extract individual pages from Standard Output.

       <b>-urx=</b><u>tx</u>
              selects <u>tx</u> as the upper right corner x coordinate (in inches) on the Postscript input page of  the
              subject image.  See the Dimensions section .

       <b>-ury=</b><u>ty</u>
              selects  <u>ty</u> as the upper right corner y coordinate (in inches) on the Postscript input page of the
              subject image.  See the Dimensions section .

       <b>-verbose</b>
              prints processing information to stdout.

       <b>-xborder=</b><u>frac</u>
              specifies that the left and right borders added to the subject image are  to  be  <u>frac</u>  times  the
              subject image width.  The default value is 0.1.  See the Dimensions section .

       <b>-xmax=</b><u>xmax</u>
              specifies  that  the  output  image  is  to  be  <u>xmax</u>  pixels  wide.  The default is 612.  See the
              Dimensions section .

       <b>-xsize=</b><u>xsize</u>
              specifies that the output image is to be <u>xsize</u> pixels wide.  See the Dimensions section .

       <b>-yborder=</b><u>frac</u>
              specifies that the top and bottom borders added to the subject image are  to  be  <u>frac</u>  times  the
              subject image height.  The default value is 0.1.  See the Dimensions section .

       <b>-ymax=</b><u>ymax</u>
              specifies  that  the  output  image  is  to  be  <u>ymax</u>  pixels  high.  The default is 792.  See the
              Dimensions section .

       <b>-ysize=</b><u>ysize</u>
              specifies that the output image is to be <u>ymax</u> pixels high.  See the Dimensions section .

       <b>-dpi=</b><u>dpi</u>
              specifies the output device resolution, in dots per inch, of the Postscript printer  that  <b>pstopnm</b>
              simulates.   This  is  the number of PNM pixels <b>pstopnm</b> generates for each inch of image.  See the
              Dimensions section .

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.21 (March 2004).

       <b>-textalphabits=</b>{<b>1</b>,<b>2</b>,<b>4</b>}
              This controls subsample antialiasing of text.  Antialiasing is a form of smoothing that eliminates
              jagged edges on characters.  Subsample antialiasing is a kind of antialiasing that uses  subpixels
              in  a  box,  and  the  value of this option is the size of that box.  4 gives you the best looking
              output, while 1 causes no antialiasing.  Smaller numbers make <b>pnmtops</b> use less CPU time.

              Pstopnm uses Ghostscript's <b>TextAlphaBits</b> parameter for this.

              The default is 4.

              This option  was  new  in  Netpbm  10.53  (December  2010).   Older  versions  of  <b>pstopnm</b>  do  no
              antialiasing.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The   program  will  produce  incorrect  results  with  PostScript  files  that  initialize  the  current
       transformation matrix.  In these cases, page translation and rotation  will  not  have  any  effect.   To
       render these files, probably the best bet is to use the following options:

           pstopnm -xborder 0 -yborder 0 -portrait -nocrop file.ps

       Additional  options  may  be needed if the document is supposed to be rendered on a medium different from
       letter-size paper.
