       rephrase - Specialized passphrase recovery tool for GnuPG

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rephrase</b>  is  a  specialized  passphrase  recovery  tool for GnuPG. If you can nearly remember your GnuPG
       passphrase - but not quite - then Rephrase may be able to help.

       Tell Rephrase the parts of the passphrase you know, and any number of alternatives for the  parts  you're
       not  sure  about;  and Rephrase will try all the alternatives, in all possible combinations, and tell you
       which combination (if any) gives you  the  correct  passphrase.   You  could  try  all  the  combinations
       yourself,  of  course,  if  there  are  just  a  handful  of  them;  but if there are more, that might be
       impractical.

       On the other hand, if you need to try a huge number of possible passphrases, Rephrase might be too  slow;
       it  is  far  from  being  an efficient passphrase cracker.  E.g. Rephrase can try out about 2600 possible
       passphrases per minute on my 1GHz Athlon (with other processes doing  nothing  very  heavy  at  the  same
       time).  How many passphrases Rephrase can try depends on how long you are prepared to wait!  Rephrase can
       reasonably be run for a long time; e.g. it *won't* use more memory the longer it runs.

       It  would  be a Bad Thing to leave your passphrase (or part of it, or your guesses at it) lying around on
       your hard drive; since a passphrase is supposed to be an extra line of defence  if  an  attacker  obtains
       access  to  your secret keyring (which you presumably *do* keep on your hard drive).  That's why Rephrase
       keeps all the information about your passphrase that you give it in secure memory (and  then  pipes  each
       possible  passphrase to a child gpg process).  For this reason, Rephrase is likely to be more secure than
       alternative solutions that involve generating a list of possible passphrases in a file and  then  testing
       them.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rephrase</b> &lt;<u>key</u>&gt;

       where  &lt;key&gt; is the key whose passphrase you want to recover; you can identify the key in any of the ways
       that GnuPG understands.  (To make sure you're using a sensible value for &lt;key&gt;, you could first try

           gpg --list-secret-keys &lt;key&gt;

       which should list exactly 1 key.)

       You will be prompted to enter a pattern (the pattern is not echoed to the screen as  you  type  it).   So
       what's  a  pattern?   Suppose you know that your passphrase was something like "super-secret", but you're
       not sure if you changed some (or all) of the "e"s into "3"s, or any of the consonants into upper case, or
       indeed changed the "c" into "k" or "K" or even "|&lt;", or changed the "-" into "  "  or  just  omitted  it.
       Then you could enter this pattern:

           (s|S)u(p|P)(e|3)(r|R)(-| |)(s|S)(e|3)(c|C|k|K|\|&lt;)(r|R)(e|3)(t|T)

       The  pattern is your passphrase - except that 4 characters have special meanings.  Brackets - "(" and ")"
       - are used to group alternatives wherever you're not sure what characters are correct; "|" is used inside
       a pair of brackets to separate the alternatives; and  "\"  is  used  to  escape  any  of  the  4  special
       characters when you need to use it literally.

       Rephrase  will  tell  you  if your pattern contains a syntax error.  That happens if there are unbalanced
       brackets (i.e. they aren't in proper pairs); or if the  pattern  ends  with  "\"  (because  then  there's
       nothing for it to escape).  It also happens (and these cases are limitations in Rephrase's simple pattern
       parser)  if you try to nest pairs of brackets; or if you try to use "|" anywhere that's not inside a pair
       of brackets.

       If the pattern contains no syntax errors, Rephrase will try each possible passphrase matching the pattern
       in turn.  If the correct passphrase is found, Rephrase won't actually  tell  you  what  it  is  (in  case
       someone's  looking  over  your  shoulder),  but  will  tell you a string of numbers: you can work out the
       correct passphrase from these numbers and the pattern you entered.  E.g.

                  2 1 2 1 2 1 1 5 1 2 2

       The first number - 2 - means that at the first pair of brackets in the pattern - "(s|S)" - you must  take
       the  second alternative - viz. "S".  The second number - 1 - means that at the seconds pair of brackets -
       "(p|P)" - you must take the first alternative - viz. "p".  And so forth.  So in  this  case  the  correct
       passphrase is "Sup3r se|&lt;r3T".

       If the correct passphrase is not found from the pattern, Rephrase tells you so.  (Note that you will also
       get  this  result  if  you  specified  &lt;key&gt;  incorretly;  how  to check that the value of &lt;key&gt; is OK is
       explained above.)

       Rephrase's exit status is 0 is the passphrase is found, 1 if it's not found, or other values if an  error
       occurs.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b></h4><pre>
       The  good news is that Rephrase uses mlock() in order to keep the information about passphrases that it's
       given as secure as possible.  The bad news is that using mlock() requires root  privileges,  so  Rephrase
       needs  to  be  setuid root.  However, it does drop root privileges very quickly, as soon as it has called
       mlock().

       It's also debatable whether mlock() is a proper way  to  protect  sensitive  information.   According  to
       POSIX,  mlock()ing  a page guarantees that it *is* in memory (useful for realtime applications), not that
       it *isn't* in the swap (useful for security applications).  Possibly an encrypted swap partition  (or  no
       swap  partition)  is  a  better solution.  Anyway, GnuPG itself uses mlock(), which makes it sensible for
       Rephrase to follow suit.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Portability is untested: I have only used Rephrase on a GNU/Linux system (Linux 2.4.21 and  Glibc  2.3.2;
       building  with  GNU  Make  3.79.1,  bash  2.05 (as <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>) and either GCC 2.95.3 or GCC 3.3).  I believe
       setreuid() is a BSD-ism, so it may not exist on more SysV-like systems.  There are  probably  many  other
       issues.

       If mlock() fails (probably because Rephrase is not setuid root), Rephrase refuses to proceed: it would be
       better to issue a warning and continue, since that's what GnuPG does.

       Before  it  asks  you  to  enter  a  pattern, Rephrase should check that the &lt;key&gt; argument does refer to
       exactly 1 key and that that key is available.

       If you'd like Rephrase to be faster, then it's too slow.  (But if you're happy with it,  then  it's  fast
       enough.)

       The standard --version and --help options are unimplemented.
