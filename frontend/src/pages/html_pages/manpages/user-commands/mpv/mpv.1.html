</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mpv - a media player

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mpv</b> [options] [file|URL|PLAYLIST|-]
       <b>mpv</b> [options] files

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mpv</b>  is  a  media player based on MPlayer and mplayer2. It supports a wide variety of video file formats,
       audio and video codecs, and subtitle types. Special input URL types are available to read  input  from  a
       variety  of  sources other than disk files. Depending on platform, a variety of different video and audio
       output methods are supported.

       Usage examples to get you started quickly can be found at the end of this man page.

</pre><h4><b>INTERACTIVE</b> <b>CONTROL</b></h4><pre>
       mpv has a fully configurable, command-driven  control  layer  which  allows  you  to  control  mpv  using
       keyboard,  mouse,  or  remote  control  (there  is  no  LIRC support - configure remotes as input devices
       instead).

       See the <b>--input-</b> options for ways to customize it.

       The following listings are not necessarily complete. See <b>etc/input.conf</b> in the mpv  source  files  for  a
       list of default bindings. User <b>input.conf</b> files and Lua scripts can define additional key bindings.

       See COMMAND INTERFACE and Key names sections for more details on configuring keybindings.

       See  also  <b>--input-test</b>  for  interactive  binding  details by key, and the stats built-in script for key
       bindings list (including print to terminal). By default, the ? key toggles the display of this list.

   <b>Keyboard</b> <b>Control</b>
       <b>LEFT</b> <b>and</b> <b>RIGHT</b>
              Seek backward/forward 5 seconds. Shift+arrow does a 1 second exact seek (see <b>--hr-seek</b>).

       <b>UP</b> <b>and</b> <b>DOWN</b>
              Seek forward/backward 1 minute. Shift+arrow does a 5 second exact seek (see <b>--hr-seek</b>).

       <b>Ctrl+LEFT</b> <b>and</b> <b>Ctrl+RIGHT</b>
              Seek to the previous/next subtitle. Subject to some restrictions and might not  always  work;  see
              <b>sub-seek</b> command.

       <b>Ctrl+Shift+LEFT</b> <b>and</b> <b>Ctrl+Shift+RIGHT</b>
              Adjust  subtitle  delay so that the previous or next subtitle is displayed now. This is especially
              useful to sync subtitles to audio.

       <b>[</b> <b>and</b> <b>]</b>
              Decrease/increase current playback speed by 10%.

       <b>{</b> <b>and</b> <b>}</b>
              Halve/double current playback speed.

       <b>BACKSPACE</b>
              Reset playback speed to normal.

       <b>Shift+BACKSPACE</b>
              Undo the last seek. This works only if the playlist entry was not changed.  Hitting  it  a  second
              time will go back to the original position.  See <b>revert-seek</b> command for details.

       <b>Shift+Ctrl+BACKSPACE</b>
              Mark  the current position. This will then be used by <b>Shift+BACKSPACE</b> as revert position (once you
              seek back, the marker will be reset). You can use this to seek around in the file and then  return
              to the exact position where you left off.

       <b>&lt;</b> <b>and</b> <b>&gt;</b>
              Go backward/forward in the playlist.

       <b>ENTER</b>  Go forward in the playlist.

       <b>Shift+HOME</b> <b>and</b> <b>Shift+END</b>
              Go to the first/last playlist entry.

       <b>p</b> <b>and</b> <b>SPACE</b>
              Pause (pressing again unpauses).

       <b>.</b>      Step  forward.  Pressing  once will pause, every consecutive press will play one frame and then go
              into pause mode again.

       <b>,</b>      Step backward. Pressing once will pause, every consecutive press will play one  frame  in  reverse
              and then go into pause mode again.

       <b>q</b>      Stop playing and quit.

       <b>Q</b>      Like  <b>q</b>,  but  store the current playback position. Playing the same file later will resume at the
              old playback position if possible. See RESUMING PLAYBACK.

              Adjust subtitle font size by +/- 10%.

       <b>u</b>      Switch between applying only <b>--sub-ass-*</b> overrides (default) to SSA/ASS subtitles, and  overriding
              them almost completely with the normal subtitle style. See <b>--sub-ass-override</b> for more info.

       <b>V</b>      Cycle through which video data gets used for ASS rendering.  See <b>--sub-ass-use-video-data</b> for more
              info.

       <b>r</b> <b>and</b> <b>R</b>
              Move subtitles up/down. The <b>t</b> key does the same as <b>R</b> currently, but use is discouraged.

       <b>s</b>      Take a screenshot.

       <b>S</b>      Take a screenshot, without subtitles. (Whether this works depends on VO driver support.)

       <b>Ctrl+s</b> Take a screenshot, as the window shows it (with subtitles, OSD, and scaled video).

   <b>Context</b> <b>Menu</b>
       <b>WARNING:</b>
          This feature is experimental. It may not work with all VOs. A libass based fallback may be implemented
          in the future.

       Context Menu is a menu that pops up on the video window on user interaction (mouse right click, etc.).

       To use this feature, you need to fill the <b>menu-data</b>  property  with  menu  definition  data,  and  add  a
       keybinding to run the <b>context-menu</b> command, which can be done with a user script.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Command  line arguments starting with <b>-</b> are interpreted as options, everything else as filenames or URLs.
       All options except <u>flag</u> options (or choice options which include <b>yes</b>) require a  parameter  in  the  form
       <b>--option=value</b>.

       One  exception  is  the  lone  <b>-</b> (without anything else), which means media data will be read from stdin.
       Also, <b>--</b> (without anything else) will make the player interpret all  following  arguments  as  filenames,
       even if they start with <b>-</b>. (To play a file named <b>-</b>, you need to use <b>./-</b>.)

       Every <u>flag</u> option has a <u>no-flag</u> counterpart, e.g. the opposite of the <b>--fs</b> option is <b>--no-fs</b>. <b>--fs=yes</b> is
       same as <b>--fs</b>, <b>--fs=no</b> is the same as <b>--no-fs</b>.

       If  an  option is marked as <u>(XXX</u> <u>only)</u>, it will only work in combination with the <u>XXX</u> option or if <u>XXX</u> is
       compiled in.

   <b>Legacy</b> <b>option</b> <b>syntax</b>
       The <b>--option=value</b> syntax is not strictly enforced, and the alternative legacy syntax <b>-option</b>  <b>value</b>  and
       <b>-option=value</b>  will  also  work.  This  is  mostly  for compatibility with MPlayer. Using these should be
       avoided. Their semantics can change any time in the future.

       For example, the alternative syntax will consider an argument following the option a filename. <b>mpv</b> <b>-fs</b> <b>no</b>
       will attempt to play a file named <b>no</b>, because <b>--fs</b> is a flag option that requires  no  parameter.  If  an
       option  changes and its parameter becomes optional, then a command line using the alternative syntax will
       break.

       Until mpv 0.31.0, there was no difference whether an option started with <b>--</b> or  a  single  <b>-</b>.  Newer  mpv
       releases  strictly  expect  that  you pass the option value after a <b>=</b>. For example, before <b>mpv</b> <b>--log-file</b>
       <b>f.txt</b> would write a log to <b>f.txt</b>, but now this command line fails, as <b>--log-file</b> expects an option value,
       and <b>f.txt</b> is simply considered a normal file to be played (as in <b>mpv</b> <b>f.txt</b>).

       The future plan is that <b>-option</b> <b>value</b> will not work anymore, and options with a single <b>-</b> behave the  same
       as <b>--</b> options.

   <b>Escaping</b> <b>spaces</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>special</b> <b>characters</b>
       Keep  in  mind that the shell will partially parse and mangle the arguments you pass to mpv. For example,
       you might need to quote or escape options and filenames:
          <b>mpv</b> <b>"filename</b> <b>with</b> <b>spaces.mkv"</b> <b>--title="window</b> <b>title"</b>

       It gets more complicated if the suboption parser is involved. The suboption parser puts  several  options
       into  a  single  string, and passes them to a component at once, instead of using multiple options on the
       level of the command line.

       The suboption parser can quote strings with <b>"</b> and <b>[...]</b>.   Additionally,  there  is  a  special  form  of
       quoting with <b>%n%</b> described below.

       For example, assume the hypothetical <b>foo</b> filter can take multiple options:
          <b>mpv</b> <b>test.mkv</b> <b>--vf=foo:option1=value1:option2:option3=value3,bar</b>

       This  passes  <b>option1</b>  and  <b>option3</b> to the <b>foo</b> filter, with <b>option2</b> as flag (implicitly <b>option2=yes</b>), and
       adds a <b>bar</b> filter after that. If an option contains spaces or characters like <b>,</b> or <b>:</b>, you need  to  quote
       them:
          <b>mpv</b> <b>'--vf=foo:option1="option</b> <b>value</b> <b>with</b> <b>spaces",bar'</b>

       Shells  may  actually  strip some quotes from the string passed to the commandline, so the example quotes
       the string twice, ensuring that mpv receives the <b>"</b> quotes.

       The <b>[...]</b> form of quotes wraps everything between <b>[</b> and <b>]</b>. It's useful with shells that  don't  interpret
       these  characters  in the middle of an argument (like bash). These quotes are balanced (since mpv 0.9.0):
       the <b>[</b> and <b>]</b> nest, and the quote terminates on the last <b>]</b> that has no matching <b>[</b> within the  string.  (For
       example, <b>[a[b]c]</b> results in <b>a[b]c</b>.)

       The fixed-length quoting syntax is intended for use with external scripts and programs.

       It is started with <b>%</b> and has the following format:

          %n%string_of_length_n

          Examples

                 <b>mpv</b> <b>'--vf=foo:option1=%11%quoted</b> <b>text'</b> <b>test.avi</b>

                 Or in a script:

                 <b>mpv</b> <b>--vf=foo:option1=%`expr</b> <b>length</b> <b>"$NAME"`%"$NAME"</b> <b>test.avi</b>

       Note: where applicable with JSON-IPC, <b>%n%</b> is the length in UTF-8 bytes, after decoding the JSON data.

       Suboptions  passed  to  the  client  API  are  also subject to escaping. Using <b>mpv_set_option_string()</b> is
       exactly like passing <b>--name=data</b> to the command line (but without shell processing of the  string).  Some
       options  support  passing  values  in  a  more  structured way instead of flat strings, and can avoid the
       suboption parsing mess. For example, <b>--vf</b> supports <b>MPV_FORMAT_NODE</b>, which lets you pass suboptions  as  a
       nested data structure of maps and arrays.

   <b>Paths</b>
       Some  care  must  be taken when passing arbitrary paths and filenames to mpv. For example, paths starting
       with <b>-</b> will be interpreted as options. Likewise, if a path contains the sequence <b>://</b>, the  string  before
       that  might be interpreted as protocol prefix, even though <b>://</b> can be part of a legal UNIX path. To avoid
       problems with arbitrary paths, you should be sure that absolute paths passed to mpv  start  with  <b>/</b>,  and
       prefix relative paths with <b>./</b>.

       Using the <b>file://</b> pseudo-protocol is discouraged, because it involves strange URL unescaping rules.

       The  name  <b>-</b> itself is interpreted as stdin, and will cause mpv to disable console controls. (Which makes
       it suitable for playing data piped to stdin.)

       The special argument <b>--</b> can be used to stop mpv from interpreting the following arguments as options.

       For paths passed to mpv suboptions (options that have multiple <u>:</u> and <u>,</u>-separated values),  the  situation
       is  further  complicated  by  the  need  to  escape special characters. To work around this, the path can
       instead be wrapped in the "fixed-length" syntax, e.g. <b>%n%string_of_length_n</b> (see above).

       When using the libmpv API, you should strictly avoid using <b>mpv_command_string</b> for invoking  the  <b>loadfile</b>
       command, and instead prefer e.g. <b>mpv_command</b> to avoid the need for filename escaping.

       The  same  applies  when  you're  using  the  scripting API, where you should avoid using <b>mp.command</b>, and
       instead prefer using "separate parameter" APIs, such as <b>mp.commandv</b> and <b>mp.command_native</b>.

       Some mpv options will interpret special meanings for paths starting with <b>~</b>, making it easy to dynamically
       find special directories, such as referring to the current user's home directory or the mpv configuration
       directory.

       When using the special <b>~</b> prefix, there must always be a trailing <b>/</b> after  the  special  path  prefix.  In
       other words, <b>~</b> doesn't work, but <b>~/</b> will work.

       The following special paths/keywords are currently recognized:

       <b>WARNING:</b>
          Beware  that  if  <b>--no-config</b>  is  used,  all  of the "config directory"-based paths (<b>~~/</b>, <b>~~home/</b> and
          <b>~~global/</b>) will be empty strings.

          This means that <b>~~home/</b> would expand to an empty string, and that sub-paths  such  as  <b>~~home/foo/bar"</b>
          would expand to a relative path (<b>foo/bar</b>), which may not be what you expected.

          Furthermore,  any  commands  that search in config directories will fail to find anything, since there
          won't be any directories to search in.

          Be sure that your scripts can handle these "no config" scenarios.

   <b>Per-File</b> <b>Options</b>
       When playing multiple files, any option given on the command line usually affects all files. Example:

          mpv --a file1.mkv --b file2.mkv --c
                                            ┌───────────┬────────────────┐
                                            │ File      │ Active options │

                                            └───────────┴────────────────┘

       (This is different from MPlayer and mplayer2.)

       Also, if any option is changed at runtime (via input commands), they are not reset when  a  new  file  is
       played.

       Sometimes,  it  is useful to change options per-file. This can be achieved by adding the special per-file
       markers <b>--{</b> and <b>--}</b>. (Note that you must escape these on some shells.) Example:

          mpv --a file1.mkv --b --\{ --c file2.mkv --d file3.mkv --e --\} file4.mkv --f
                                       ┌───────────┬─────────────────────────┐

                                       └───────────┴─────────────────────────┘

       Additionally, any file-local option changed at runtime is reset when the current file stops  playing.  If
       option  <b>--c</b>  is  changed during playback of <b>file2.mkv</b>, it is reset when advancing to <b>file3.mkv</b>. This only
       affects file-local options. The option <b>--a</b> is never reset here.

   <b>List</b> <b>Options</b>
       Some options which store lists of option values can have action suffixes. For example, the <b>--display-tags</b>
       option takes a <b>,</b>-separated list of tags, but the option also allows you  to  append  a  single  tag  with
       <b>--display-tags-append</b>,  and  the  tag  name  can  for  example  contain  a literal <b>,</b> without the need for
       escaping.

   <b>String</b> <b>list</b> <b>and</b> <b>path</b> <b>list</b> <b>options</b>
       String lists are separated by <b>,</b>. The strings are not parsed or interpreted by the option  system  itself.
       However, most path or file list options use <b>:</b> (Unix) or <b>;</b> (Windows) as separator, instead of <b>,</b>.

       They support the following operations:

       <b>-append</b> is meant as a simple way to append a single item without having to escape the argument  (you  may
       still need to escape on the shell level).

   <b>Key/value</b> <b>list</b> <b>options</b>
       A  key/value  list  is  a  list  of  key/value  string pairs. In programming languages, this type of data
       structure is often called a map or a dictionary. The order normally does not  matter,  although  in  some
       cases the order might matter.

       Keys are unique within the list. If an already present key is set, the existing key is removed before the
       new value is appended.

       If  you  want  to  pass  a  value  without interpreting it for escapes or <b>,</b>, it is recommended to use the
       <b>-append</b> variant. When using libmpv, prefer using <b>MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP</b>; when using a scripting  backend  or
       the JSON IPC, use an appropriate structured data type.

       Prior to mpv 0.33, <b>:</b> was also recognized as separator by <b>-set</b>.

   <b>Object</b> <b>settings</b> <b>list</b> <b>options</b>
       This  is  a  very  complex  option  type  for  some  options,  such as <b>--af</b> and <b>--vf</b>.  They often require

   <b>General</b>
       Without suffix, the operation used is normally <b>-set</b>.

       Some operations like <b>-add</b> and <b>-pre</b> specify multiple items, but be aware that you may need to  escape  the
       arguments.  <b>-append</b> accepts a single, unescaped item only (so the <b>,</b> separator will not be interpreted and
       is passed on as part of the value).

       Some options (like <b>--sub-file</b>, <b>--audio-file</b>, <b>--glsl-shader</b>)  are  aliases  for  the  proper  option  with
       <b>-append</b> action. For example, <b>--sub-file</b> is an alias for <b>--sub-files-append</b>.

       Options  of  this  type  can  be changed at runtime using the <b>change-list</b> command, which takes the suffix
       (without the <b>-</b>) as separate operation parameter.

       An object settings list can hold up to 100 elements.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Location</b> <b>and</b> <b>Syntax</b>
       You can put all of the options in configuration files which will be read  every  time  mpv  is  run.  The
       system-wide  configuration  file  'mpv.conf'  is  in  your  configuration  directory  (e.g.  <b>/etc/mpv</b>  or
       <b>/usr/local/etc/mpv</b>), the user-specific one is <b><a href="file:~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf">~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf</a></b>. For details and platform  specifics
       (in particular Windows paths) see the FILES section.

       User-specific  options  override system-wide options and options given on the command line override both.
       The syntax of the configuration files is <b>option=value</b>. Everything after a  <u>#</u>  is  considered  a  comment.
       Options  that  work  without values can be enabled by setting them to <u>yes</u> and disabled by setting them to
       <u>no</u>, and if the value is omitted, <u>yes</u> is implied. Even suboptions can be specified in this way.

          Example configuration file

              # Don't allow new windows to be larger than the screen.
              autofit-larger=100%x100%
              # Enable hardware decoding if available, =yes is implied.
              hwdec
              # Spaces don't have to be escaped.
              osd-playing-msg=File: ${filename}

   <b>Escaping</b> <b>special</b> <b>characters</b>
       This is done like with command line options. A config entry can be quoted with <b>"</b>, <b>'</b>, as well as with  the
       fixed-length  syntax (<b>%n%</b>) mentioned before. This is like passing the exact contents of the quoted string
       as a command line option. C-style escapes are currently _not_ interpreted on this  level,  although  some
       options  do this manually (this is a mess and should probably be changed at some point). The shell is not
       involved here, so option values only need to be quoted to escape <b>#</b> anywhere in the value, <b>"</b>, <b>'</b>  or  <b>%</b>  at
       the beginning of the value, and leading and trailing whitespace.

   <b>Putting</b> <b>Command</b> <b>Line</b> <b>Options</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Configuration</b> <b>File</b>
       Almost all command line options can be put into the configuration file. Here is a small guide:

   <b>File-specific</b> <b>Configuration</b> <b>Files</b>
       You can also write file-specific configuration files. If you wish to have a configuration file for a file
       called  'video.avi', create a file named 'video.avi.conf' with the file-specific options in it and put it
       in <b><a href="file:~/.config/mpv/">~/.config/mpv/</a></b>. You can also put the configuration file in the  same  directory  as  the  file  to  be
       played.  Both  require  you  to  set the <b>--use-filedir-conf</b> option (either on the command line or in your
       global config file).  If  a  file-specific  configuration  file  is  found  in  the  same  directory,  no
       file-specific  configuration  is  loaded  from  <b><a href="file:~/.config/mpv">~/.config/mpv</a></b>. In addition, the <b>--use-filedir-conf</b> option
       enables directory-specific configuration files.  For this, mpv first tries to load a  mpv.conf  from  the
       same directory as the file played and then tries to load any file-specific configuration.

   <b>Profiles</b>
       To  ease  working  with  different  configurations, profiles can be defined in the configuration files. A
       profile starts with its name in square brackets, e.g. <b>[my-profile]</b>. All following options will be part of
       the profile. A description (shown by <b>--profile=help</b>) can be defined with the <b>profile-desc</b> option. To  end
       the profile, start another one or use the profile name <b>default</b> to continue with normal options.

       You  can list profiles with <b>--profile=help</b>, and show the contents of a profile with <b>--show-profile=&lt;name&gt;</b>
       (replace <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> with the profile name). You can apply profiles on start with the <b>--profile=&lt;name&gt;</b> option,
       or at runtime with the <b>apply-profile</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> command.

          Example mpv config file with profiles

              # normal top-level option
              fullscreen=yes

              # a profile that can be enabled with --profile=big-cache
              [big-cache]
              cache=yes
              demuxer-max-bytes=512MiB
              demuxer-readahead-secs=20

              [network]
              profile-desc="profile for content over network"
              force-window=immediate
              # you can also include other profiles
              profile=big-cache

              [reduce-judder]
              video-sync=display-resample
              interpolation=yes

              # using a profile again extends it
              [network]
              demuxer-max-back-bytes=512MiB
              # reference a builtin profile
              profile=fast

   <b>Runtime</b> <b>profiles</b>
       Profiles can be set at runtime with <b>apply-profile</b> command. Since this operation is  "destructive"  (every
       item  in a profile is simply set as an option, overwriting the previous value), you can't just enable and
       disable profiles again.

       As a partial remedy, there is a way to make profiles save old option values before overwriting them  with
       the profile values, and then restoring the old values at a later point using <b>apply-profile</b> <b>&lt;profile-name&gt;</b>
       <b>restore</b>.

       This can be enabled with the <b>profile-restore</b> option, which takes one of the following options:

          <b>default</b>
                 Does nothing, and nothing can be restored (default).

          <b>copy</b>   When  applying a profile, copy the old values of all profile options to a backup before setting
                 them from the profile. These options are reset to  their  old  values  using  the  backup  when
                 restoring.

                 Every  profile  has  its  own  list  of backed up values. If the backup already exists (e.g. if
                 <b>apply-profile</b> <b>name</b> was called more than once in a row), the existing backup is no changed.  The
                 restore operation will remove the backup.

                 It's  important to know that restoring does not "undo" setting an option, but simply copies the
                 old option value. Consider for example <b>vf-add</b>, appends an entry  to  <b>vf</b>.  This  mechanism  will
                 simply  copy  the  entire  <b>vf</b> list, and does _not_ execute the inverse of <b>vf-add</b> (that would be
                 <b>vf-remove</b>) on restoring.

                 Note that if a profile contains recursive profiles (via the <b>profile</b>  option),  the  options  in
                 these  recursive  profiles  are  treated  as  if they were part of this profile. The referenced
                 profile's backup list is not used when creating or using the backup. Restoring a  profile  does
                 not  restore referenced profiles, only the options of referenced profiles (as if they were part
                 of the main profile).

          <b>copy-equal</b>
                 Similar to <b>copy</b>, but restore an option only if it has the same value as the  value  effectively
                 set  by  the  profile.  This  tries  to deal with the situation when the user does not want the
                 option to be reset after interactively changing it.

          Example

              [something]
              profile-restore=copy-equal
              vf-add=rotate=PI/2  # rotate by 90 degrees

          Then running these commands will result in behavior as commented:

              set vf vflip
              apply-profile something
              vf add hflip
              apply-profile something
              # vf == vflip,rotate=PI/2,hflip,rotate=PI/2
              apply-profile something restore
              # vf == vflip

   <b>Conditional</b> <b>auto</b> <b>profiles</b>
       Profiles which have the <b>profile-cond</b> option set are applied automatically  if  the  associated  condition
       matches  (unless  auto  profiles  are  disabled).  The option takes a string, which is interpreted as Lua
       expression. If the expression evaluates as truthy, the profile is applied. If the  expression  errors  or
       evaluates as falsy, the profile is not applied. This Lua code execution is not sandboxed.

       Any  variables in condition expressions can reference properties. If an identifier is not already defined
       by Lua or mpv, it is interpreted as property.  For example, <b>pause</b> would return the current pause  status.
       You  cannot  reference  properties  with  <b>-</b>  this  way  since that would denote a subtraction, but if the
       variable name contains any <b>_</b> characters, they are turned into <b>-</b>. For example, <b>playback_time</b> would  return
       the property <b>playback-time</b>.

       A  more  robust way to access properties is using <b>p.property_name</b> or <b>get("property-name",</b> <b>default_value)</b>.
       The automatic variable to property magic will break if a new identifier with the same name is  introduced
       (for  example, if a function named <b>pause()</b> were added, <b>pause</b> would return a function value instead of the
       value of the <b>pause</b> property).

       Note that if a property is not available, it  will  return  <b>nil</b>,  which  can  cause  errors  if  used  in
       expressions. These are logged in verbose mode, and the expression is considered to be false.

       Whenever  a  property  referenced  by  a profile condition changes, the condition is re-evaluated. If the
       return value of the condition changes from falsy or error to truthy, the profile is applied.

       This mechanism tries to "unapply" profiles once the condition changes from truthy to falsy or  error.  If
       you  want  to use this, you need to set <b>profile-restore</b> for the profile. Another possibility it to create
       another profile with an inverse condition to undo the other profile.

       Recursive profiles can be used. But it is discouraged  to  reference  other  conditional  profiles  in  a
       conditional profile, since this can lead to tricky and unintuitive behavior.

          Example

                 Make only HD video look funny:

              [something]
              profile-desc=HD video sucks
              profile-cond=width &gt;= 1280
              hue=-50

          Make only videos containing "youtube" or "youtu.be" in their path brighter:

              [youtube]
              profile-cond=path:find('youtu%.?be')
              gamma=20

          If  you  want  the  profile  to  be  reverted  if  the  condition  goes  to  false  again, you can set
          <b>profile-restore</b>:

              [something]
              profile-desc=Mess up video when entering fullscreen
              profile-cond=fullscreen
              profile-restore=copy
              vf-add=rotate=PI/2  # rotate by 90 degrees

          This appends the <b>rotate</b> filter to the video  filter  chain  when  entering  fullscreen.  When  leaving
          fullscreen,  the <b>vf</b> option is set to the value it had before entering fullscreen. Note that this would
          also remove any other filters that were added during fullscreen mode by the  user.  Avoiding  this  is
          trickier,  and  could  for  example be solved by adding a second profile with an inverse condition and
          operation:

              [something]
              profile-cond=fullscreen
              vf-add=@rot:rotate=PI/2

              [something-inv]
              profile-cond=not fullscreen
              vf-remove=@rot

       <b>WARNING:</b>
          Every time an involved property changes, the condition is evaluated again.   If  your  condition  uses
          <b>p.playback_time</b> for example, the condition is re-evaluated approximately on every video frame. This is
          probably slow.

       This  feature  is  managed  by  an  internal  Lua script. Conditions are executed as Lua code within this
       script. Its environment contains at least the following things:

       <b>(function</b> <b>environment</b> <b>table)</b>
              Every Lua function has an environment table. This is used for identifier access. There is no named
              Lua symbol for it; it is implicit.

              The environment does "magic" accesses to mpv properties. If an identifier is not  already  defined
              in  <b>_G</b>,  it  retrieves  the  mpv  property  of the same name. Any occurrences of <b>_</b> in the name are
              replaced  with  <b>-</b>  before  reading  the  property.  The  returned  value  is   as   retrieved   by
              <b>mp.get_property_native(name)</b>.  Internally,  a  cache  of property values, updated by observing the
              property is used instead, so properties that are not observable will be stuck at the initial value
              forever.

              If you want to access properties, that actually contain <b>_</b> in the name, use <b>get()</b> (which  does  not
              perform transliteration).

              Internally, the environment table has a <b>__index</b> meta method set, which performs the access logic.

       <b>p</b>      A  "magic"  table  similar  to  the  environment  table.  Unlike  the latter, this does not prefer
              accessing variables defined in <b>_G</b> - it always accesses properties.

       <b>get(name</b> <b>[,</b> <b>def])</b>
              Read a property and return its value. If the property value is <b>nil</b> (e.g.  if the property does not
              exist), <b>def</b> is returned.

              This is superficially similar to <b>mp.get_property_native(name)</b>. An  important  difference  is  that
              this  accesses  the  property cache, and enables the change detection logic (which is essential to
              the dynamic runtime behavior of auto profiles). Also, it does not return an error value as  second
              return value.

              The  "magic"  tables  mentioned  above  use  this  function  as backend. It does not perform the <b>_</b>
              transliteration.

       In addition, the same environment as in a blank mpv Lua script is present. For example, <b>math</b>  is  defined
       and gives access to the Lua standard math library.

       <b>WARNING:</b>
          This  feature  is  subject  to change indefinitely. You might be forced to adjust your profiles on mpv
          updates.

   <b>Legacy</b> <b>auto</b> <b>profiles</b>
       Some profiles are loaded automatically using a legacy mechanism. The following example demonstrates this:

          Auto profile loading

              [extension.mkv]
              profile-desc="profile for .mkv files"
              vf=vflip

       The profile name follows the schema <b>type.name</b>, where type can be <b>protocol</b> for the  input/output  protocol
       in  use  (see <b>--list-protocols</b>), and <b>extension</b> for the extension of the path of the currently played file
       (<u>not</u> the file format).

       This feature is very limited, and is considered soft-deprecated. Use conditional auto profiles.

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>MPV</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>OTHER</b> <b>PROGRAMS</b> <b>OR</b> <b>SCRIPTS</b></h4><pre>
       There are three choices for using mpv from other programs or scripts:

          1. Calling it as UNIX process. If you do this, <u>do</u> <u>not</u> <u>parse</u> <u>terminal</u> <u>output</u>.  The terminal  output  is
             intended  for humans, and may change any time. In addition, terminal behavior itself may change any
             time. Compatibility cannot be guaranteed.

             Your code should work even if you pass <b>--terminal=no</b>. Do not attempt  to  simulate  user  input  by
             sending   terminal  control  codes  to  mpv's  stdin.   If  you  need  interactive  control,  using
             <b>--input-ipc-server</b> or <b>--input-ipc-client</b> is recommended. This gives you  access  to  the  JSON  IPC
             over unix domain sockets (or named pipes on Windows).

             Depending on what you do, passing <b>--no-config</b> or <b>--config-dir</b> may be a good idea to avoid conflicts
             with the normal mpv user configuration intended for CLI playback.

             Using  <b>--input-ipc-server</b>  or  <b>--input-ipc-client</b> is also suitable for purposes like remote control
             (however, the IPC protocol itself is not "secure" and not intended to be so).

          2. Using libmpv. This is generally recommended when mpv is used as playback backend for  a  completely
             different application. The provided C API is very close to CLI mechanisms and the scripting API.

             Note  that even though libmpv has different defaults, it can be configured to work exactly like the
             CLI player (except command line parsing is unavailable).

             See EMBEDDING INTO OTHER PROGRAMS (LIBMPV).

          3. As a user script (LUA SCRIPTING, JAVASCRIPT, C PLUGINS). This is recommended when the  goal  is  to
             "enhance" the CLI player. Scripts get access to the entire client API of mpv.

             This is the standard way to create third-party extensions for the player.

       All  these access the client API, which is the sum of the various mechanisms provided by the player core,
       as documented here: OPTIONS, List of Input Commands, Properties, List of events (also see C API), Hooks.

</pre><h4><b>TAKING</b> <b>SCREENSHOTS</b></h4><pre>
       Screenshots of the currently played file can be taken using the 'screenshot' input mode command, which is
       by default bound to the <b>s</b> key. Files named <b>mpv-shotNNNN.jpg</b> will be saved in the working directory, using
       the first available number - no files will be overwritten. In pseudo-GUI mode,  the  screenshot  will  be
       saved somewhere else. See PSEUDO GUI MODE.

       A  screenshot  will  usually contain the unscaled video contents at the end of the video filter chain and
       subtitles. By default, <b>S</b> takes screenshots without subtitles, while <b>s</b> includes subtitles.

       Unlike with MPlayer, the <b>screenshot</b> video filter is not required. This filter was never required in  mpv,
       and has been removed.

</pre><h4><b>TERMINAL</b> <b>STATUS</b> <b>LINE</b></h4><pre>
       During playback, mpv shows the playback status on the terminal. It looks like something like this:
          <b>AV:</b> <b>00:03:12</b> <b>/</b> <b>00:24:25</b> <b>(13%)</b> <b>A-V:</b> <b>-0.000</b>

       The status line can be overridden with the <b>--term-status-msg</b> option.

       The following is a list of things that can show up in the status line. Input properties, that can be used
       to get the same information manually, are also listed.

       • <b>AV:</b> or <b>V:</b> (video only) or <b>A:</b> (audio only)

       • The current time position in <b>HH:MM:SS</b> format (<b>playback-time</b> property)

       • The total file duration (absent if unknown) (<b>duration</b> property)

       • Playback  speed,  e.g. <b>x2.0</b>. Only visible if the speed is not normal. This is the user-requested speed,
         and not the actual speed  (usually they should be the  same,  unless  playback  is  too  slow).  (<b>speed</b>
         property.)

       • Playback  percentage,  e.g.  <b>(13%)</b>.  How  much of the file has been played.  Normally calculated out of
         playback position and duration, but can fallback to other methods (like byte position) if these are not
         available.  (<b>percent-pos</b> property.)

       • The audio/video sync as <b>A-V:</b>  <b>0.000</b>. This is the difference between audio and video time.  Normally  it
         should be 0 or close to 0. If it's growing, it might indicate a playback problem. (<b>avsync</b> property.)

       • Total A/V sync change, e.g. <b>ct:</b> <b>-0.417</b>. Normally invisible. Can show up if there is audio "missing", or
         not enough frames can be dropped. Usually this will indicate a problem. (<b>total-avsync-change</b> property.)

       • Encoding state in <b>{...}</b>, only shown in encoding mode.

       • Display  sync state. If display sync is active (<b>display-sync-active</b> property), this shows <b>DS:</b> <b>2.500/13</b>,
         where the first number is average number of vsyncs per video frame (e.g. 2.5 when playing  24Hz  videos
         on  60Hz  screens),  which  might  jitter  if the ratio doesn't round off, or there are mistimed frames
         (<b>vsync-ratio</b>),  and  the  second  number  of  estimated  number  of  vsyncs   which   took   too   long
         (<b>vo-delayed-frame-count</b>  property).  The  latter  is  a  heuristic,  as  it's generally not possible to
         determine this with certainty.

       • Dropped frames, e.g. <b>Dropped:</b> <b>4</b>. Shows up only if the count is not 0. Can grow if the  video  framerate
         is  higher  than  that  of  the  display, or if video rendering is too slow. May also be incremented on
         "hiccups" and when the video frame couldn't be displayed on time. (<b>frame-drop-count</b> property.)  If  the
         decoder  drops  frames,  the number of decoder-dropped frames is appended to the display as well, e.g.:
         <b>Dropped:</b> <b>4/34</b>. This happens only if decoder frame dropping is enabled  with  the  <b>--framedrop</b>  options.
         (<b>decoder-frame-drop-count</b> property.)

       • Cache  state, e.g. <b>Cache:</b>  <b>2s/134KB</b>. Visible if the stream cache is enabled.  The first value shows the
         amount of video buffered in the demuxer in seconds, the second value shows the estimated  size  of  the
         buffered amount in kilobytes.  (<b>demuxer-cache-duration</b> and <b>demuxer-cache-state</b> properties.)

</pre><h4><b>LOW</b> <b>LATENCY</b> <b>PLAYBACK</b></h4><pre>
       mpv  is optimized for normal video playback, meaning it actually tries to buffer as much data as it seems
       to make sense. This will increase latency. Reducing latency is possible only  by  specifically  disabling
       features which increase latency.

       The  builtin <b>low-latency</b> profile tries to apply some of the options which can reduce latency. You can use
       <b>--profile=low-latency</b> to apply all of them. You can list  the  contents  with  <b>--show-profile=low-latency</b>
       (some of the options are quite obscure, and may change every mpv release).

       Be aware that some of the options can reduce playback quality.

       Most latency is actually caused by inconvenient timing behavior. You can disable this with <b>--untimed</b>, but
       it  will  likely  break,  unless  the  stream  has  no audio, and the input feeds data to the player at a
       constant rate.

       Another common problem is with MJPEG streams. These do not signal the correct framerate. Using  <b>--untimed</b>
       or <b>--correct-pts=no</b> <b>--container-fps-override=60</b> might help.

       For  livestreams,  data  can  build up due to pausing the stream, due to slightly lower playback rate, or
       "buffering" pauses. If the demuxer cache is enabled, these can  be  skipped  manually.  The  experimental
       <b>drop-buffers</b> command can be used to discard any buffered data, though it's very disruptive.

       In some cases, manually tuning TCP buffer sizes and such can help to reduce latency.

       Additional options that can be tried:

       • <b>--opengl-glfinish=yes</b>, can reduce buffering in the graphics driver

       • <b>--opengl-swapinterval=0</b>, same

       • <b>--vo=xv</b>, same

       • without audio <b>--framedrop=no</b> <b>--speed=1.01</b> may help for live sources (results can be mixed)

</pre><h4><b>RESUMING</b> <b>PLAYBACK</b></h4><pre>
       mpv  is  capable of storing the playback position of the currently playing file and resume from there the
       next time that file is played. This is done with the  commands  <b>quit-watch-later</b>  (bound  to  Shift+Q  by
       default) and <b>write-watch-later-config</b>, and with the <b>--save-position-on-quit</b> option.

       The   difference   between   always   quitting   with   a   key   bound  to  <b>quit-watch-later</b>  and  using
       <b>--save-position-on-quit</b> is that the latter will save the playback position even when mpv is closed with a
       method other than a keybinding, such as clicking the close button in the window title bar. However if mpv
       is terminated abruptly and doesn't have the time to save, then the  position  will  not  be  saved.   For
       example, if you shutdown your system without closing mpv beforehand.

       mpv  also  stores  options  other  than the playback position when they have been modified after playback
       began, for example the volume and selected audio/subtitles, and restores their values the next  time  the
       file is played. Which options are saved can be configured with the <b>--watch-later-options</b> option.

       When  playing  multiple playlist entries, mpv checks if one them has a resume config file associated, and
       if it finds one it restarts playback from it. For example, if you use <b>quit-watch-later</b> on the 5th episode
       of a show, and later play all the episodes, mpv will automatically resume playback from episode 5.

       More options to configure this functionality are listed in Watch Later.

</pre><h4><b>PROTOCOLS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mpv://...</b>
          mpv protocol. This is used for starting mpv from URL handler. The protocol is stripped and the rest is
          passed to the player as a normal open argument.  Only safe network protocols are allowed to be  opened
          this way.

       <b>http://...</b>, <b>https://</b>, ...
          Many network protocols are supported, but the protocol prefix must always be specified. mpv will never
          attempt  to  guess  whether  a  filename  is  actually  a network address. A protocol prefix is always
          required.

          Note that not all prefixes are documented here. Undocumented prefixes are either aliases to documented
          protocols, or are just redirections to protocols implemented and documented in FFmpeg.

          <b>data:</b> is supported, but needs to be in the format <b>data://</b>.  This  is  done  to  avoid  ambiguity  with
          filenames. You can also prefix it with <b>lavf://</b> or <b>ffmpeg://</b>.

       <b>ytdl://...</b>
          By  default,  the  youtube-dl  hook  script  only looks at http(s) URLs. Prefixing an URL with <b>ytdl://</b>
          forces it to be always processed by the script. This can also be used  to  invoke  special  youtube-dl
          functionality like playing a video by ID or invoking search.

          Keep  in  mind  that  you  can't  pass  youtube-dl  command  line options by this, and you have to use
          <b>--ytdl-raw-options</b> instead.

       <b>-</b>
          Play data from stdin.

       <b>smb://PATH</b>
          Play a path from  Samba share. (Requires FFmpeg support.)

       <b>bd://[title][/device]</b> <b>--bluray-device=PATH</b>
          Play a Blu-ray disc. Since  libbluray  1.0.1,  you  can  read  from  ISO  files  by  passing  them  to
          <b>--bluray-device</b>.

          <b>title</b>  can  be:  <b>longest</b> or <b>first</b> (selects the default playlist); <b>mpls/&lt;number&gt;</b> (selects &lt;number&gt;.mpls
          playlist); <b>&lt;number&gt;</b> (select playlist with the same index). mpv will list the  available  playlists  on
          loading.

          <b>bluray://</b> is an alias.

       <b>dvd://[title][/device]</b> <b>--dvd-device=PATH</b>
          Play  a  DVD.  DVD  menus are not supported. If no title is given, the longest title is auto-selected.
          Without <b>--dvd-device</b>, it will probably  try  to  open  an  actual  optical  drive,  if  available  and
          implemented for the OS.

          <b>dvdnav://</b> is an old alias for <b>dvd://</b> and does exactly the same thing.

       <b>dvb://[cardnumber@]channel</b> <b>--dvbin-...</b>
          Digital TV via DVB. (Linux only.)

       <b>mf://[@listfile|filemask|glob|printf-format]</b> <b>--mf-...</b>
          Play a series of images as video.

          If  the  URL  path  begins  with <b>@</b>, it is interpreted as the path to a file containing a list of image
          paths separated by newlines. If the URL path contains <b>,</b>, it is interpreted as a list  of  image  paths
          separated  by  <b>,</b>.  If  the  URL path does not contain <b>%</b> and if on POSIX platforms, is interpreted as a
          glob, and <b>*</b> is automatically appended if  it  was  not  specified.  Otherwise,  the  printf  sequences
          <b>%[.][NUM]d</b>,  where  <b>NUM</b> is one, two, or three decimal digits, and <b>%%</b> and are interpreted. For example,
          <b>mf://image-%d.jpg</b> plays files like <b>image-1.jpg</b>, <b>image-2.jpg</b> and <b>image-10.jpg</b>, provided that there  are
          no big gaps between the files.

       <b>cdda://[device]</b> <b>--cdda-device=PATH</b>
          Play  CD. You can select a specific range of tracks to play by using the <b>--start</b> and <b>--end</b> options and
          specifying chapters. Navigating forwards and backwards through tracks can also be done  by  navigating
          through chapters (<b>PGUP</b> and <b>PGDOWN</b> in the default keybinds).

              Example

                 mpv cdda:// --start=#4 --end=#6

              This will start from track 4, play track 5, and then end.

       <b>lavf://...</b>
          Access  any  FFmpeg  libavformat  protocol. Basically, this passed the string after the <b>//</b> directly to
          libavformat.

       <b>av://type:options</b>
          This is intended for using libavdevice inputs. <b>type</b> is the libavdevice demuxer name,  and  <b>options</b>  is
          the (pseudo-)filename passed to the demuxer.

              Example

                 mpv av://v4l2:/dev/video0 --profile=low-latency --untimed

              This  plays  video  from  the first v4l input with nearly the lowest latency possible. It's a good
              replacement for the removed <b>tv://</b> input.  Using <b>--untimed</b> is a hack to  output  a  captured  frame
              immediately,  instead  of respecting the input framerate. (There may be better ways to handle this
              in the future.)

          <b>avdevice://</b> is an alias.

       <b>file://PATH</b>
          A local path as URL. Might be useful in some special use-cases. Note that  <b>PATH</b>  itself  should  start
          with a third <b>/</b> to make the path an absolute path.

       <b>appending://PATH</b>
          Play  a  local  file, but assume it's being appended to. This is useful for example for files that are
          currently being downloaded to disk. This will block playback, and stop playback only if  no  new  data
          was appended after a timeout of about 2 seconds.

          Using this is still a bit of a bad idea, because there is no way to detect if a file is actually being
          appended,  or  if  it's  still written. If you're trying to play the  output of some program, consider
          using a pipe (<b>something</b> <b>|</b> <b>mpv</b> <b>-</b>). If it really has to be a file on disk, use  tail  to  make  it  wait
          forever, e.g. <b>tail</b> <b>-f</b> <b>-c</b> <b>+0</b> <b>file.mkv</b> <b>|</b> <b>mpv</b> <b>-</b>.

       <b>fd://123</b>
          Read  data  from  the given file descriptor (for example 123). This is similar to piping data to stdin
          via <b>-</b>, but can use an arbitrary file descriptor.  mpv may modify some file descriptor properties  when
          the stream layer "opens" it.

       <b>fdclose://123</b>
          Like  <b>fd://</b>,  but the file descriptor is closed after use. When using this you need to ensure that the
          same fd URL will only be used once.

       <b>edl://[edl</b> <b>specification</b> <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>edl-mpv.rst]</b>
          Stitch together parts of multiple files and play them.

       <b>slice://start[-end]@URL</b>
          Read a slice of a stream.

          <b>start</b> and <b>end</b> represent a byte range and accept suffixes such as <b>KiB</b> and <b>MiB</b>. <b>end</b> is optional.

          if <b>end</b> starts with <b>+</b>, it is considered as offset from <b>start</b>.

          Only works with seekable streams.

          Examples:

              mpv slice://<a href="mailto:1g-2g@cap.ts">1g-2g@cap.ts</a>

              This starts reading from cap.ts after seeking 1 GiB, then
              reads until reaching 2 GiB or end of file.

              mpv slice://1g-+<a href="mailto:2g@cap.ts">2g@cap.ts</a>

              This starts reading from cap.ts after seeking 1 GiB, then
              reads until reaching 3 GiB or end of file.

              mpv slice://100m@appending://cap.ts

              This starts reading from cap.ts after seeking 100MiB, then
              reads until end of file.

       <b>null://</b>
          Simulate an empty file. If opened for writing, it will  discard  all  data.   The  <b>null</b>  demuxer  will
          specifically pass autoprobing if this protocol is used (while it's not automatically invoked for empty
          files).

       <b>memory://data</b>
          Use the <b>data</b> part as source data.

       <b>hex://data</b>
          Like <b>memory://</b>, but the string is interpreted as hexdump.

</pre><h4><b>PSEUDO</b> <b>GUI</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       mpv  has  no  official GUI, other than the OSC (ON SCREEN CONTROLLER), which is not a full GUI and is not
       meant to be. However, to compensate for the lack of expected GUI behavior, mpv will in some  cases  start
       with some settings changed to behave slightly more like a GUI mode.

       Currently this happens only in the following cases:

       • if  started  using the <b>mpv.desktop</b> file on Linux (e.g. started from menus or file associations provided
         by desktop environments)

       • if started from explorer.exe on Windows (technically, if it was started on  Windows,  and  all  of  the
         stdout/stderr/stdin handles are unset)

       • started out of the bundle on macOS

       • if you manually use <b>--player-operation-mode=pseudo-gui</b> on the command line

       This mode applies options from the builtin profile <b>builtin-pseudo-gui</b>, but only if these haven't been set
       in   the   user's  config  file  or  on  the  command  line,  which  is  the  main  difference  to  using
       <b>--profile=builtin-pseudo-gui</b>.

       The profile is currently defined as follows:

          [builtin-pseudo-gui]
          terminal=no
          force-window=yes
          idle=once
          screenshot-directory=~~desktop/

       The <b>pseudo-gui</b> profile exists for compatibility. The  options  in  the  <b>pseudo-gui</b>  profile  are  applied
       unconditionally.   In  addition,  the  profile  makes  sure  to  enable  the  pseudo-GUI  mode,  so  that
       <b>--profile=pseudo-gui</b> works like in older mpv releases:

          [pseudo-gui]
          player-operation-mode=pseudo-gui

       <b>WARNING:</b>
          Currently, you can extend the  <b>pseudo-gui</b>  profile  in  the  config  file  the  normal  way.  This  is
          deprecated. In future mpv releases, the behavior might change, and not apply your additional settings,
          and/or use a different profile name.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Track</b> <b>Selection</b>
       <b>--alang=&lt;languagecode[,languagecode,...]&gt;</b>
              Specify a prioritized list of audio languages to use, as IETF language tags.  Equivalent ISO 639-1
              two-letter  and  ISO 639-2 three-letter codes are treated the same. The first tag in the list that
              matches track's language in the file will be used. A track  that  matches  more  subtags  will  be
              preferred over one that matches fewer. See also <b>--aid</b>.

              This is a string list option. See List Options for details.

                 Examples

                 • <b>mpv</b>  <b>dvd://1</b>  <b>--alang=hu,en</b>  chooses  the Hungarian language track on a DVD and falls back on
                   English if Hungarian is not available.

                 • <b>mpv</b> <b>--alang=jpn</b> <b>example.mkv</b> plays a Matroska file with Japanese audio.

       <b>--slang=&lt;languagecode[,languagecode,...]&gt;</b>
              Equivalent to <b>--alang</b>, for subtitle tracks.

              This is a string list option. See List Options for details.

                 Examples

                 • <b>mpv</b> <b>dvd://1</b> <b>--slang=hu,en</b> chooses the Hungarian subtitle track on a DVD  and  falls  back  on
                   English if Hungarian is not available.

                 • <b>mpv</b> <b>--slang=jpn</b> <b>example.mkv</b> plays a Matroska file with Japanese subtitles.

                 • <b>mpv</b>  <b>--slang=pt-BR</b>  <b>example.mkv</b>  plays a Matroska file with Brazilian Portuguese subtitles if
                   available, and otherwise any Portuguese subtitles.

       <b>--vlang=&lt;...&gt;</b>
              Equivalent to <b>--alang</b> and <b>--slang</b>, for video tracks.

              This is a string list option. See List Options for details.

       <b>--aid=&lt;ID|auto|no&gt;</b>
              Select audio track. <b>auto</b> selects the default, <b>no</b> disables audio.  See also <b>--alang</b>.  mpv  normally
              prints available audio tracks on the terminal when starting playback of a file.

              <b>--audio</b> is an alias for <b>--aid</b>.

              <b>--aid=no</b> or <b>--audio=no</b> disables audio playback.  (The latter variant does not work with the client
              API.)

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 The  track  selection  options  (<b>--aid</b> but also <b>--sid</b> and the others) sometimes expose behavior
                 that may appear strange. Also, the behavior tends to change around with each mpv release.

                 The track selection properties will return the option value outside of playback (as  expected),
                 but  during  playback, the affective track selection is returned. For example, with <b>--aid=auto</b>,
                 the <b>aid</b> property will suddenly return <b>2</b> after playback initialization (assuming the file has at
                 least 2 audio tracks, and the second is the default).

                 At mpv 0.32.0 (and some releases before), if you passed a track value for which a corresponding
                 track didn't exist (e.g. <b>--aid=2</b> and there was only 1 audio track), the <b>aid</b>  property  returned
                 <b>no</b>.  However  if  another  audio  track was added during playback, and you tried to set the <b>aid</b>
                 property to <b>2</b>, nothing happened, because the <b>aid</b> option still had the value <b>2</b>, and writing  the
                 same value has no effect.

                 With  mpv  0.33.0,  the  behavior was changed. Now track selection options are reset to <b>auto</b> at
                 playback initialization, if the option had tries to select a track that  does  not  exist.  The
                 same  is  done  if  the  track  exists, but fails to initialize. The consequence is that unlike
                 before mpv 0.33.0, the user's track selection parameters are clobbered in certain situations.

                 Also since mpv 0.33.0, trying to select a track by number  will  strictly  select  this  track.
                 Before  this  change,  trying  to  select  a track which did not exist would fall back to track
                 default selection at playback initialization. The new behavior is more consistent.

                 Setting a track selection property at runtime, and then playing a  new  file  might  reset  the
                 track selection to defaults, if the fingerprint of the track list of the new file is different.

                 Be  aware  of  tricky  combinations  of  all  of  all  of  the  above: for example, <b>mpv</b> <b>--aid=2</b>
                 <b>file_with_2_audio_tracks.mkv</b> <b>file_with_1_audio_track.mkv</b> would first play  the  correct  track,
                 and  the  second file without audio.  If you then go back the first file, its first audio track
                 will be played, and the second file is played with audio. If you do the same  thing  again  but
                 instead  of  using  <b>--aid=2</b>  you  run <b>set</b> <b>aid</b> <b>2</b> while the file is playing, then changing to the
                 second file will play  its  audio  track.   This  is  because  runtime  selection  enables  the
                 fingerprint heuristic.

                 Most likely this is not the end.

       <b>--sid=&lt;ID|auto|no&gt;</b>
              Display the subtitle stream specified by <b>&lt;ID&gt;</b>. <b>auto</b> selects the default, <b>no</b> disables subtitles.

              <b>--sub</b> is an alias for <b>--sid</b>.

              <b>--sid=no</b>  or  <b>--sub=no</b>  disables  subtitle  decoding.   (The latter variant does not work with the
              client API.)

       <b>--vid=&lt;ID|auto|no&gt;</b>
              Select video channel. <b>auto</b> selects the default, <b>no</b> disables video.

              <b>--video</b> is an alias for <b>--vid</b>.

              <b>--vid=no</b> or <b>--video=no</b> disables video playback.  (The latter variant does not work with the client
              API.)

              If video is disabled, mpv will  try  to  download  the  audio  only  if  media  is  streamed  with
              youtube-dl,   because   it   saves   bandwidth.  This  is  done  by  setting  the  ytdl_format  to
              "bestaudio/best" in the ytdl_hook.lua script.

       <b>--edition=&lt;ID|auto&gt;</b>
              (Matroska files only) Specify the edition (set of chapters) to use, where 0 is the first.  If  set
              to  <b>auto</b> (the default), mpv will choose the first edition declared as a default, or if there is no
              default, the first edition defined.

       <b>--track-auto-selection=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Enable the default track auto-selection (default: yes). Enabling this will make the player  select
              streams  according  to  <b>--aid</b>,  <b>--alang</b>, and others. If it is disabled, no tracks are selected. In
              addition, the player will not exit if no tracks are selected, and wait instead (this wait mode  is
              similar to pausing, but the pause option is not set).

              This  is  useful  with  <b>--lavfi-complex</b>:  you can start playback in this mode, and then set select
              tracks at runtime by setting the filter  graph.   Note  that  if  <b>--lavfi-complex</b>  is  set  before
              playback is started, the referenced tracks are always selected.

       <b>--subs-with-matching-audio=&lt;yes|forced|no&gt;</b>
              When  autoselecting  a  subtitle  track,  select  it even if the selected audio stream matches you
              preferred subtitle language (default: yes). If this option is set to <b>no</b>, then  no  subtitle  track
              that  matches  the  audio  language  will  ever  be  autoselected  by mpv regardless of <b>--slang</b> or
              <b>subs-fallback</b>. If set to <b>forced</b>, then only forced subtitles will be selected.

       <b>--subs-match-os-language=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              When autoselecting a subtitle track, select the track that matches the language of your OS if  the
              audio  stream  is  in  a different language if suitable (default track or a forced track under the
              right conditions). Note that if <b>--slang</b> is set, this will be completely ignored (default: yes).

       <b>--subs-fallback=&lt;yes|default|no&gt;</b>
              When autoselecting a subtitle track, if no tracks match your preferred languages,  select  a  full
              track  even if it doesn't match your preferred subtitle language (default: default).  Setting this
              to <u>default</u> means that only streams flagged as <u>default</u> will be selected.

       <b>--subs-fallback-forced=&lt;yes|no|always&gt;</b>
              When autoselecting a subtitle track, the default value of <u>yes</u> will prefer using a forced  subtitle
              track  if  the  subtitle  language  matches  the audio language and matches your list of preferred
              languages. The special value <u>always</u> will only select forced subtitle tracks and never fallback  on
              a non-forced track. Conversely, <u>no</u> will never select a forced subtitle track.

   <b>Playback</b> <b>Control</b>
       <b>--start=&lt;relative</b> <b>time&gt;</b>
              Seek to given time position.

              The  general  format for times is <b>[+|-][[hh:]mm:]ss[.ms]</b>. If the time is prefixed with <b>-</b>, the time
              is considered relative from the end of the file (as signaled by the  demuxer/the  file).  A  <b>+</b>  is
              usually ignored (but see below).

              The following alternative time specifications are recognized:

              <b>pp%</b> seeks to percent position pp (0-100).

              <b>#c</b> seeks to chapter number c. (Chapters start from 1.)

              <b>none</b> resets any previously set option (useful for libmpv).

              If  <b>--rebase-start-time=no</b>  is  given,  then prefixing times with <b>+</b> makes the time relative to the
              start of the file. A timestamp without prefix is considered an absolute time, i.e. should seek  to
              a  frame  with a timestamp as the file contains it. As a bug, but also a hidden feature, putting 1
              or more spaces before the <b>+</b> or <b>-</b> always interprets the time as absolute, which can be used to seek
              to negative timestamps (useful for debugging at most).

                 Examples

                 <b>--start=+56,</b> <b>--start=00:56</b>
                        Seeks to the start time + 56 seconds.

                 <b>--start=-56,</b> <b>--start=-00:56</b>
                        Seeks to the end time - 56 seconds.

                 <b>--start=01:10:00</b>
                        Seeks to 1 hour 10 min.

                 <b>--start=50%</b>
                        Seeks to the middle of the file.

                 <b>--start=30</b> <b>--end=40</b>
                        Seeks to 30 seconds, plays 10 seconds, and exits.

                 <b>--start=-3:20</b> <b>--length=10</b>
                        Seeks to 3 minutes and 20 seconds before the end of the  file,  plays  10  seconds,  and
                        exits.

                 <b>--start='#2'</b> <b>--end='#4'</b>
                        Plays chapters 2 and 3, and exits.

       <b>--end=&lt;relative</b> <b>time&gt;</b>
              Stop  at given time. Use <b>--length</b> if the time should be relative to <b>--start</b>. See <b>--start</b> for valid
              option values and examples.

       <b>--length=&lt;relative</b> <b>time&gt;</b>
              Stop after a given time relative to the start time.  See  <b>--start</b>  for  valid  option  values  and
              examples.

              If  both  <b>--end</b>  and  <b>--length</b>  are provided, playback will stop when it reaches either of the two
              endpoints.

              Obscurity note: this does not work correctly if <b>--rebase-start-time=no</b>, and the specified time  is
              not an "absolute" time, as defined in the <b>--start</b> option description.

       <b>--rebase-start-time=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Whether  to  move  the  file start time to <b>00:00:00</b> (default: yes). This is less awkward for files
              which start at a random timestamp, such as transport streams. On the  other  hand,  if  there  are
              timestamp resets, the resulting behavior can be rather weird. For this reason, and in case you are
              actually interested in the real timestamps, this behavior can be disabled with <b>no</b>.

       <b>--speed=&lt;0.01-100&gt;</b>
              Slow down or speed up playback by the factor given as parameter.

              If  <b>--audio-pitch-correction</b>  (on  by  default)  is  used, playing with a speed higher than normal
              automatically inserts the <b>scaletempo2</b> audio filter.

       <b>--pitch=&lt;0.01-100&gt;</b>
              Raise or lower the audio's pitch by the factor given as parameter. Does not affect playback speed.
              Playing with an altered pitch automatically inserts the <b>scaletempo2</b> audio filter.

              Since pitch change is achieved by combining pitch-preserving  speed  change  and  resampling,  the
              range  of  pitch  change  is  effectively  limited  by  the  <b>min-speed</b> and <b>max-speed</b> parameters of
              <b>scaletempo2</b>: for example, a <b>min-speed</b> of 0.25 limits the highest pitch factor to 4 (1/0.25).

              In a standard 12-tone scale system, octaves are separated by a factor of 2 whereas  semitones  are
              represented  by  a  factor of 2^(1/12). This means pitches can easily be shifted up or down with a
              simple multiplier.

                 Examples

                 <b>--pitch=2</b>
                        Shifts the pitch up a full octave.

                 <b>--pitch=0.5</b>
                        Shifts the pitch down an octave.

                 <b>--pitch=1.498307</b> <b>(2^(7/12))</b>
                        Shifts the pitch up a perfect fifth.

                 <b>--pitch=0.667420</b> <b>(2^(-7/12))</b>
                        Shifts the pitch down a perfect fifth.

                 <b>--pitch=1.059463</b> <b>(2^(1/12))</b>
                        Shifts the pitch up a semitone.

                 <b>--pitch=0.943874</b> <b>(2^(-1/12))</b>
                        Shifts the pitch down a semitone.

       <b>--pause</b>
              Start the player in paused state.

       <b>--shuffle</b>
              Play files in random order.

       <b>--playlist-start=&lt;auto|index&gt;</b>
              Set which file on the internal playlist to start playback with. The index is an  integer,  with  0
              meaning  the  first  file. The value <b>auto</b> means that the selection of the entry to play is left to
              the playback resume mechanism (default). If an entry with  the  given  index  doesn't  exist,  the
              behavior  is unspecified and might change in future mpv versions. The same applies if the playlist
              contains further playlists (don't expect any reasonable behavior). Passing a playlist file to  mpv
              should  work  with  this  option,  though. E.g. <b>mpv</b> <b>playlist.m3u</b> <b>--playlist-start=123</b> will work as
              expected, as long as <b>playlist.m3u</b> does not link to further playlists.

              The value <b>no</b> is a deprecated alias for <b>auto</b>.

       <b>--playlist=&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Play files according to a playlist file. Supports some common formats. If no format  is  detected,
              it  will be treated as list of files, separated by newline characters. You may need this option to
              load plaintext files as a playlist. Note that XML playlist formats are not supported.

              This option forces <b>--demuxer=playlist</b> to interpret the  playlist  file.   Some  playlist  formats,
              notably  CUE  and optical disc formats, need to use different demuxers and will not work with this
              option. They still can be played directly, without using this option.

              You can play playlists directly, without this option.  Before  mpv  version  0.31.0,  this  option
              disabled  any  security  mechanisms  that  might  be  in  place, but since 0.31.0 it uses the same
              security mechanisms as playing a playlist file directly. If you trust the playlist file,  you  can
              disable  any  security  checks  with  <b>--load-unsafe-playlists</b>.  Because  playlists  can load other
              playlist entries, consider applying this option only to the playlist itself and not  its  entries,
              using something along these lines:
                 <b>mpv</b> <b>--{</b> <b>--playlist=filename</b> <b>--load-unsafe-playlists</b> <b>--}</b>

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 The  way  older  versions  of  mpv  played  playlist  files via <b>--playlist</b> was not safe against
                 maliciously constructed files. Such files may trigger harmful actions. This has been  the  case
                 for  all versions of mpv prior to 0.31.0, and all MPlayer versions, but unfortunately this fact
                 was not well documented earlier, and some people have even misguidedly recommended the  use  of
                 <b>--playlist</b>  with untrusted sources. Do NOT use <b>--playlist</b> with random internet sources or files
                 you do not trust if you are not sure your mpv is at least 0.31.0.

                 In particular, playlists can contain entries using protocols other than local  files,  such  as
                 special protocols like <b>avdevice://</b> (which are inherently unsafe).

       <b>--chapter-merge-threshold=&lt;number&gt;</b>
              Threshold  for  merging  almost  consecutive ordered chapter parts in milliseconds (default: 100).
              Some Matroska files with ordered chapters have inaccurate chapter end timestamps, causing a  small
              gap  between  the end of one chapter and the start of the next one when they should match.  If the
              end of one playback part is less than the given threshold away from the start of the next one then
              keep playing video normally over the chapter change instead of doing a seek.

       <b>--chapter-seek-threshold=&lt;seconds&gt;</b>
              Distance in seconds from the beginning of a chapter within which a backward chapter seek  will  go
              to  the  previous  chapter (default: 5.0). Past this threshold, a backward chapter seek will go to
              the beginning of the current chapter instead. A  negative  value  means  always  go  back  to  the
              previous chapter.

       <b>--hr-seek=&lt;no|absolute|yes|default&gt;</b>
              Select  when  to  use precise seeks that are not limited to keyframes. Such seeks require decoding
              video from the previous keyframe up to the target position and so can take some time depending  on
              decoding  performance. For some video formats, precise seeks are disabled. This option selects the
              default choice to use for seeks; it is  possible  to  explicitly  override  that  default  in  the
              definition of key bindings and in input commands.

              <b>no</b>     Never use precise seeks.

              <b>absolute</b>
                     Use  precise  seeks  if  the seek is to an absolute position in the file, such as a chapter
                     seek, but not for relative seeks like the default behavior of arrow keys.

              <b>default</b>
                     Like  <b>absolute</b>,  but  enable  hr-seeks  in  audio-only  cases.  The   exact   behavior   is
                     implementation specific and may change with new releases (default).

              <b>yes</b>    Use precise seeks whenever possible.

              <b>always</b> Same as <b>yes</b> (for compatibility).

       <b>--hr-seek-demuxer-offset=&lt;seconds&gt;</b>
              This option exists to work around failures to do precise seeks (as in <b>--hr-seek</b>) caused by bugs or
              limitations in the demuxers for some file formats. Some demuxers fail to seek to a keyframe before
              the  given  target  position,  going  to  a  later  position  instead. The value of this option is
              subtracted from the time stamp given to the demuxer. Thus, if you set this option to 1.5  and  try
              to  do  a  precise  seek  to 60 seconds, the demuxer is told to seek to time 58.5, which hopefully
              reduces the chance that it erroneously goes to some time later than 60 seconds.  The  downside  of
              setting  this  option  is  that  precise seeks become slower, as video between the earlier demuxer
              position and the real target may be unnecessarily decoded.

       <b>--hr-seek-framedrop=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Allow the video decoder to drop frames during seek, if these frames are before the seek target. If
              this is enabled, precise seeking can be faster, but if you're using  video  filters  which  modify
              timestamps  or add new frames, it can lead to precise seeking skipping the target frame. This e.g.
              can break frame backstepping when deinterlacing is enabled.

              Default: <b>yes</b>

       <b>--index=&lt;mode&gt;</b>
              Controls how to seek in files. Note that if the index is missing from a file, it will be built  on
              the fly by default, so you don't need to change this. But it might help with some broken files.

              <b>default</b>
                     use an index if the file has one, or build it if missing

              <b>recreate</b>
                     don't read or use the file's index

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This  option  only  works  if the underlying media supports seeking (i.e. not with stdin, pipe,
                 etc).

       <b>--load-unsafe-playlists</b>
              Load URLs from playlists  which  are  considered  unsafe  (default:  no).  This  includes  special
              protocols  and  anything  that  doesn't  refer to normal files.  Local files and HTTP links on the
              other hand are always considered safe.

              In addition, if a playlist is loaded while this is set, the added playlist entries are not  marked
              as  originating  from  network or potentially unsafe location. (Instead, the behavior is as if the
              playlist entries were provided directly to mpv command line or <b>loadfile</b> command.)

       <b>--access-references=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Follow any references in the file being opened (default: yes). Disabling this is  helpful  if  the
              file  is  automatically  scanned (e.g. thumbnail generation). If the thumbnail scanner for example
              encounters a playlist file, which contains network URLs, and the scanner should  not  open  these,
              enabling  this  option  will prevent it. This option also disables ordered chapters, mov reference
              files, opening of archives, and a number of other features.

              On older FFmpeg versions, this will not work in some cases. Some FFmpeg demuxers might not respect
              this option.

              This option does not prevent opening of paired subtitle files and such. Use <b>--autoload-files=no</b> to
              prevent this.

              This option does not always work if you open non-files (for example  using  <b>dvd://directory</b>  would
              open  a whole bunch of files in the given directory). Prefixing the filename with <b>./</b> if it doesn't
              start with a <b>/</b> will avoid this.

       <b>--loop-playlist=&lt;N|inf|force|no&gt;,</b> <b>--loop-playlist</b>
              Loops playback <b>N</b> times. A value of <b>1</b> plays it one time (default), <b>2</b>  two  times,  etc.  <b>inf</b>  means
              forever. <b>no</b> is the same as <b>1</b> and disables looping. If several files are specified on command line,
              the entire playlist is looped. <b>--loop-playlist</b> is the same as <b>--loop-playlist=inf</b>.

              The  <b>force</b> mode is like <b>inf</b>, but does not skip playlist entries which have been marked as failing.
              This means the player might waste CPU time trying to loop a file that doesn't exist. But it  might
              be useful for playing webradios under very bad network conditions.

       <b>--loop-file=&lt;N|inf|no&gt;,</b> <b>--loop=&lt;N|inf|no&gt;</b>
              Loop  a  single  file  N  times.  <b>inf</b>  means forever, <b>no</b> means normal playback. For compatibility,
              <b>--loop-file</b> and <b>--loop-file=yes</b> are also accepted, and are the same as <b>--loop-file=inf</b>.

              The difference to <b>--loop-playlist</b> is that this doesn't loop the playlist, just the file itself. If
              the playlist contains only a single file, the difference between  the  two  option  is  that  this
              option performs a seek on loop, instead of reloading the file.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 <b>--loop-file</b>  counts  the  number  of times it causes the player to seek to the beginning of the
                 file, not the number of full playthroughs. This means <b>--loop-file=1</b> will  end  up  playing  the
                 file twice. Contrast with <b>--loop-playlist</b>, which counts the number of full playthroughs.

              <b>--loop</b> is an alias for this option.

       <b>--ab-loop-a=&lt;time&gt;,</b> <b>--ab-loop-b=&lt;time&gt;</b>
              Set loop points. If playback passes the <b>b</b> timestamp, it will seek to the <b>a</b> timestamp. Seeking past
              the <b>b</b> point doesn't loop (this is intentional).

              If  <b>a</b>  is  after <b>b</b>, the behavior is as if the points were given in the right order, and the player
              will seek to <b>b</b> after crossing through <b>a</b>. This is different from old behavior,  where  looping  was
              disabled (and as a bug, looped back to <b>a</b> on the end of the file).

              If  either  options  are  set  to  <b>no</b>  (or unset), looping is disabled. This is different from old
              behavior, where an unset <b>a</b> implied the start of the file, and an unset <b>b</b> the end of the file.

              The loop-points can be adjusted at runtime with the corresponding  properties.  See  also  <b>ab-loop</b>
              command.

       <b>--ab-loop-count=&lt;N|inf&gt;</b>
              Run  A-B  loops  only  N  times,  then  ignore the A-B loop points (default: inf).  <b>inf</b> means that
              looping goes on forever. If this option is set to 0, A-B looping is ignored, and even the  <b>ab-loop</b>
              command will not enable looping again (the command will show <b>(disabled)</b> on the OSD message if both
              loop points are set, but <b>ab-loop-count</b> is 0).

       <b>--ordered-chapters=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Enable  support  for  Matroska  ordered chapters. mpv will load and search for video segments from
              other files, and will also respect any chapter order specified for the main file (default: yes).

       <b>--ordered-chapters-files=&lt;playlist-file&gt;</b>
              Loads the given file as playlist, and tries to use the files contained in it  as  reference  files
              when  opening  a Matroska file that uses ordered chapters. This overrides the normal mechanism for
              loading referenced files by scanning the same directory the main file is located in.

              Useful for loading ordered chapter files that are not located on the local filesystem, or  if  the
              referenced files are in different directories.

              Note: a playlist can be as simple as a text file containing filenames separated by newlines.

       <b>--chapters-file=&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Load chapters from this file, instead of using the chapter metadata found in the main file.

              This accepts a media file (like mkv) or even a pseudo-format like ffmetadata and uses its chapters
              to replace the current file's chapters. This doesn't work with OGM or XML chapters directly.

       <b>--sstep=&lt;sec&gt;</b>
              Skip &lt;sec&gt; seconds after every frame.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Without <b>--hr-seek</b>, skipping will snap to keyframes.

       <b>--stop-playback-on-init-failure=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Stop  playback if either audio or video fails to initialize (default: no).  With <b>no</b>, playback will
              continue in video-only or audio-only mode if one of them fails. This doesn't  affect  playback  of
              audio-only or video-only files.

       <b>--play-direction=&lt;forward|+|backward|-&gt;</b>
              Control  the playback direction (default: forward). Setting <b>backward</b> will attempt to play the file
              in reverse direction, with decreasing playback time. If this is set on playback  starts,  playback
              will  start  from  the  end  of the file. If this is changed at during playback, a hr-seek will be
              issued to change the direction.

              <b>+</b> and <b>-</b> are aliases for <b>forward</b> and <b>backward</b>.

              The rest of this option description pertains to the <b>backward</b> mode.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Backward playback is extremely fragile. It may not always work, is  much  slower  than  forward
                 playback, and breaks certain other features. How well it works depends mainly on the file being
                 played. Generally, it will show good results (or results at all) only if the stars align.

              mpv,  as well as most media formats, were designed for forward playback only. Backward playback is
              bolted on top of mpv, and tries to make a medium effort to make backward playback work.  Depending
              on your use-case, another tool may work much better.

              Backward playback is not exactly a 1st class feature. Implementation tradeoffs were made, that are
              bad  for  backward  playback,  but in turn do not cause disadvantages for normal playback. Various
              possible optimizations are not implemented in order to keep the complexity down. Normally, a media
              player is highly pipelined (future data is prepared in separate threads, so  it  is  available  in
              realtime  when the next stage needs it), but backward playback will essentially stall the pipeline
              at various random points.

              For example, for intra-only codecs are trivially backward playable, and tools  built  around  them
              may  make efficient use of them (consider video editors or camera viewers). mpv won't be efficient
              in this case, because it uses its generic backward playback algorithm, that on top of  it  is  not
              very optimized.

              If  you  just  want  to  quickly go backward through the video and just show "keyframes", just use
              forward playback, and hold down the left cursor key (which on CLI with default config  sends  many
              small relative seek commands).

              The implementation consists of mostly 3 parts:

              • Backward  demuxing.  This  relies  on  the  demuxer cache, so the demuxer cache should (or must,
                didn't test it) be enabled, and its size will affect performance. If the cache is too  small  or
                too large, quadratic runtime behavior may result.

              • Backward  decoding.  The decoder library used (libavcodec) does not support this. It is emulated
                by feeding bits of data in forward, putting the result in a queue, returning the queue  data  to
                the  VO in reverse, and then starting over at an earlier position. This can require buffering an
                extreme amount of decoded data, and also completely breaks pipelining.

              • Backward output. This is relatively simple, because the decoder returns the frames in the needed
                order. However, this may cause various problems  because  filters  see  audio  and  video  going
                backward.

              Known problems:

              • It's  fragile. If anything doesn't work, random behavior may occur.  In simple cases, the player
                will just play nonsense and artifacts.  In other cases, it  may  get  stuck  or  heat  the  CPU.
                (Exceeding memory usage significantly beyond the user-set limits would be a bug, though.)

              • Performance  and  resource  usage  isn't  good. In part this is inherent to backward playback of
                normal media formats, and in parts due to implementation choices and tradeoffs.

              • This is extremely reliant on good demuxer  behavior.  Although  backward  demuxing  requires  no
                special  demuxer support, it is required that the demuxer performs seeks reliably, fulfills some
                specific requirements about packet metadata, and has deterministic behavior.

              • Starting playback exactly from the end may or may not work, depending on  seeking  behavior  and
                file duration detection.

              • Some  container  formats, audio, and video codecs are not supported due to their behavior. There
                is no list, and the player usually does not detect them.  Certain  live  streams  (including  TV
                captures)  may  exhibit  problems  in  particular,  as  well  as  some  lossy audio codecs. h264
                intra-refresh is known not to work due to problems with libavcodec. WAV and some other raw audio
                formats tend to have problems - there are hacks for dealing with them,  which  may  or  may  not
                work.

              • Backward  demuxing of subtitles is not supported. Subtitle display still works for some external
                text subtitle formats. (These are fully read into memory, and only backward display is  needed.)
                Text  subtitles  that  are  cached  in  the subtitle renderer also have a chance to be displayed
                correctly.

              • Some features dealing with playback of broken or hard to deal with files  will  not  work  fully
                (such as timestamp correction).

              • If  demuxer  low level seeks (i.e. seeking the actual demuxer instead of just within the demuxer
                cache) are performed by backward playback, the created seek ranges may  not  join,  because  not
                enough overlap is achieved.

              • Trying  to  use  this with hardware video decoding will probably exhaust all your GPU memory and
                then crash a thing or two. Or it will fail because <b>--hwdec-extra-frames</b> will  certainly  be  set
                too low.

              • Stream  recording  is  broken.  <b>--stream-record</b>  may  keep working if you backward play within a
                cached region only.

              • Relative seeks may behave weird. Small seeks backward (towards smaller time, i.e. <b>seek</b>  <b>-1</b>)  may
                not really seek properly, and audio will remain muted for a while. Using hr-seek is recommended,
                which should have none of these problems.

              • Some  things  are  just  weird. For example, while seek commands manipulate playback time in the
                expected way (provided they work correctly), the framestep commands are transposed. Backstepping
                will perform very expensive work to step forward by 1 frame.

              Tuning:

              • Remove all <b>--vf</b>/<b>--af</b> filters you have set. Disable hardware  decoding.  Disable  functions  like
                SPDIF passthrough.

              • Increasing  <b>--video-reversal-buffer</b> might help if reversal queue overflow is reported, which may
                happen in high bitrate video, or video with large GOP. Hardware decoding  mostly  ignores  this,
                and  you  need  to  increase <b>--hwdec-extra-frames</b> instead (until you get playback without logged
                errors).

              • The demuxer cache is essential for backward demuxing. Make sure to set  <b>--cache=yes</b>.  The  cache
                size  might  matter.  If  it's too small, a queue overflow will be logged, and backward playback
                cannot continue, or it performs too many low level seeks.  If  it's  too  large,  implementation
                tradeoffs  may cause general performance issues. Use <b>--demuxer-max-bytes</b> to potentially increase
                the amount of packets the demuxer layer can queue  for  reverse  demuxing  (basically  it's  the
                <b>--video-reversal-buffer</b> equivalent for the demuxer layer).

              • Setting <b>--vd-queue-enable=yes</b> can help a lot to make playback smooth (once it works).

              • <b>--demuxer-backward-playback-step</b>  also factors into how many seeks may be performed, and whether
                backward demuxing could break due to  queue  overflow.  If  it's  set  too  high,  the  backstep
                operation needs to search through more packets all the time, even if the cache is large enough.

              • Setting  <b>--demuxer-cache-wait</b> may be useful to cache the entire file into the demuxer cache. Set
                <b>--demuxer-max-bytes</b>  to  a  large  size  to  make  sure  it   can   read   the   entire   cache;
                <b>--demuxer-max-back-bytes</b>  should  also  be set to a large size to prevent that tries to trim the
                cache.

              • If  audio  artifacts  are  audible,  even  though  the  AO   does   not   underrun,   increasing
                <b>--audio-backward-overlap</b> might help in some cases.

       <b>--video-reversal-buffer=&lt;bytesize&gt;,</b> <b>--audio-reversal-buffer=&lt;bytesize&gt;</b>
              For  backward  decoding. Backward decoding decodes forward in steps, and then reverses the decoder
              output. These options control the approximate maximum amount of bytes that can  be  buffered.  The
              main  use  of this is to avoid unbounded resource usage; during normal backward playback, it's not
              supposed to hit the limit, and if it does, it will drop frames and complain about it.

              Use this option if you get reversal queue overflow errors during backward playback.  Increase  the
              size  until  the  warning disappears. Usually, the video buffer will overflow first, especially if
              it's high resolution video.

              This does not work correctly if video hardware decoding is used. The video  frame  size  will  not
              include  the  referenced  GPU  and  driver  memory.  Some hardware decoders may also be limited by
              <b>--hwdec-extra-frames</b>.

              How large the queue size needs to be depends entirely on the way  the  media  was  encoded.  Audio
              typically requires a very small buffer, while video can require excessively large buffers.

              (Technically,  this  allows  the  last  frame to exceed the limit. Also, this does not account for
              other buffered frames, such as inside the decoder or the video output.)

              This does not affect demuxer cache behavior at all.

              See <b>--list-options</b> for defaults and value range. <b>&lt;bytesize&gt;</b> options accept suffixes  such  as  <b>KiB</b>
              and <b>MiB</b>.

       <b>--video-backward-overlap=&lt;auto|number&gt;,</b> <b>--audio-backward-overlap=&lt;auto|number&gt;</b>
              Number  of overlapping keyframe ranges to use for backward decoding (default: auto) ("keyframe" to
              be understood as in the mpv/ffmpeg specific meaning).  Backward decoding works by forward decoding
              in small steps. Some codecs cannot restart decoding from any packet (even if it's marked  as  seek
              point),  which becomes noticeable with backward decoding (in theory this is a problem with seeking
              too, but <b>--hr-seek-demuxer-offset</b> can fix it for seeking).  In particular, MDCT based audio codecs
              are affected.

              The solution is to feed a previous packet to the decoder each time, and then discard  the  output.
              This  option  controls  how  many packets to feed. The <b>auto</b> choice is currently hardcoded to 0 for
              video, and uses 1 for lossy audio, 0 for lossless audio. For some  specific  lossy  audio  codecs,
              this is set to 2.

              <b>--video-backward-overlap</b>  can  potentially  handle  intra-refresh  video,  depending  on the exact
              conditions. You may have to use the <b>--vd-lavc-show-all</b> option as well.

       <b>--video-backward-batch=&lt;number&gt;,</b> <b>--audio-backward-batch=&lt;number&gt;</b>
              Number of keyframe ranges to decode at once when backward decoding (default: 1 for video,  10  for
              audio). Another pointless tuning parameter nobody should use. This should affect performance only.
              In  theory,  setting  a  number  higher than 1 for audio will reduce overhead due to less frequent
              backstep operations and less redundant decoding work due to  fewer  decoded  overlap  frames  (see
              <b>--audio-backward-overlap</b>). On the other hand, it requires a larger reversal buffer, and could make
              playback  less  smooth  due to breaking pipelining (e.g. by decoding a lot, and then doing nothing
              for a while).

              It probably never makes sense to set <b>--video-backward-batch</b>. But in theory,  it  could  help  with
              intra-only video codecs by reducing backstep operations.

       <b>--demuxer-backward-playback-step=&lt;seconds&gt;</b>
              Number  of  seconds  the  demuxer  should  seek  back  to get new packets during backward playback
              (default: 60). This is useful for tuning backward playback, see <b>--play-direction</b> for details.

              Setting this to a very low value or 0 may make the player think seeking is broken, or may make  it
              perform multiple seeks.

              Setting this to a high value may lead to quadratic runtime behavior.

   <b>Program</b> <b>Behavior</b>
       <b>--help,</b> <b>--h</b>
              Show short summary of options.

              You can also pass a string to this option, which will list all top-level options which contain the
              string in the name, e.g. <b>--h=scale</b> for all options that contain the word <b>scale</b>. The special string
              <b>*</b> lists all top-level options.

       <b>-v</b>     Increment verbosity level, one level for each <b>-v</b> found on the command line.

       <b>--version,</b> <b>-V</b>
              Print version string and exit.

       <b>--no-config</b>
              Do  not load default configuration or any user files. This prevents loading of both the user-level
              and system-wide <b>mpv.conf</b> and <b>input.conf</b> files. Other user files  are  blocked  as  well,  such  as
              resume  playback files and cache files.  This option only takes effect when used as a command line
              flag.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Files explicitly requested by command line options, like <b>--include</b> or <b>--use-filedir-conf</b>,  will
                 still be loaded.

              See also: <b>--config-dir</b>.

       <b>--list-options</b>
              Prints all available options.

       <b>--list-properties</b>
              Print a list of the available properties.

       <b>--list-protocols</b>
              Print a list of the supported protocols.

       <b>--log-file=&lt;path&gt;</b>
              Opens  the given path for writing, and print log messages to it. Existing files will be truncated.
              The log level is at least <b>-v</b> <b>-v</b>, but can be raised via <b>--msg-level</b> (the  option  cannot  lower  it
              below the forced minimum log level).

              A  special  case  is  the  macOS  bundle,  it  will create a log file at <b><a href="file:~/Library/Logs/mpv.log">~/Library/Logs/mpv.log</a></b> by
              default.

       <b>--config-dir=&lt;path&gt;</b>
              Force a different configuration directory. If this is set, the given directory  is  used  to  load
              configuration  files,  and  all other configuration directories are ignored. This means the global
              mpv configuration directory as well as per-user directories are  ignored,  and  overrides  through
              environment variables (<b>MPV_HOME</b>) are also ignored.

              Note  that  the  cache and state paths (<b>~<a href="file:~/cache">~/cache</a></b>, <b>~<a href="file:~/state">~/state</a></b>) are not considered "configuration" and
              keep their auto-detection logic.

              Note that the <b>--no-config</b> option takes precedence over this option.

       <b>--dump-stats=&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Write certain statistics to the given file. The file  is  truncated  on  opening.  The  file  will
              contain  raw  samples,  each  with  a  timestamp.  To  make  this file into a readable, the script
              <b>TOOLS/stats-conv.py</b> can be used (which currently displays it as a graph).

              This option is useful for debugging only.

       <b>--idle=&lt;no|yes|once&gt;</b>
              Makes mpv wait idly instead of quitting when there is no file to play.   Mostly  useful  in  input
              mode, where mpv can be controlled through input commands. (Default: <b>no</b>)

              <b>once</b> will only idle at start and let the player close once the first playlist has finished playing
              back.

       <b>--include=&lt;configuration-file&gt;</b>
              Specify configuration file to be parsed after the default ones.

       <b>--load-scripts=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              If  set  to  <b>no</b>,  don't  auto-load  scripts  from  the <b>scripts</b> configuration subdirectory (usually
              <b><a href="file:~/.config/mpv/scripts/">~/.config/mpv/scripts/</a></b>).  (Default: <b>yes</b>)

       <b>--script=&lt;filename&gt;,</b> <b>--scripts=file1.lua:file2.lua:...</b>
              Load a Lua script. The second option allows you to load multiple scripts by separating  them  with
              the path separator (<b>:</b> on Unix, <b>;</b> on Windows).

              <b>--scripts</b> is a path list option. See List Options for details.

       <b>--script-opt=&lt;key=value&gt;,</b> <b>--script-opts=key1=value1,key2=value2,...</b>
              Set  options  for  scripts.  A  script  can  query an option by key. If an option is used and what
              semantics the option value has depends entirely on the loaded scripts. Values not claimed  by  any
              scripts are ignored.

              Each  use  of  the  <b>--script-opt</b>  option  will  add  another  option  to  the internal list, while
              <b>--script-opts</b> takes a list of options at once, and overwrites  the  internal  list  with  it.  The
              latter is a key/value list option. See List Options for details.

       <b>--merge-files</b>
              Pretend  that  all  files  passed  to  mpv  are  concatenated  into  a single, big file. This uses
              timeline/EDL support internally.

       <b>--profile=&lt;profile1,profile2,...&gt;</b>
              Use the given profile(s), <b>--profile=help</b> displays a list of the defined profiles.

       <b>--reset-on-next-file=&lt;all|option1,option2,...&gt;</b>
              Normally, mpv will try to keep all settings when playing the next file on the  playlist,  even  if
              they  were changed by the user during playback. (This behavior is the opposite of MPlayer's, which
              tries to reset all settings when starting next file.)

              Default: Do not reset anything.

              This can be changed with this option. It accepts a list of options, and mpv will reset  the  value
              of  these  options on playback start to the initial value. The initial value is either the default
              value, or as set by the config file or command line.

              The special name <b>all</b> resets as many options as possible.

              This is a string list option. See List Options for details.

                 Examples

                 • <b>--reset-on-next-file=pause</b> Reset pause mode when switching to the next file.

                 • <b>--reset-on-next-file=fullscreen,speed</b> Reset fullscreen and playback speed  settings  if  they
                   were changed during playback.

                 • <b>--reset-on-next-file=all</b> Try to reset all settings that were changed during playback.

       <b>--show-profile=&lt;profile&gt;</b>
              Show the description and content of a profile. Lists all profiles if no parameter is provided.

       <b>--use-filedir-conf</b>
              Look  for  a  file-specific  configuration  file  in  the same directory as the file that is being
              played. See File-specific Configuration Files.

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 May be dangerous if playing from untrusted media.

       <b>--ytdl=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Enable the youtube-dl hook-script. It will look at the input URL, and will play the video  located
              on  the  website.  This works with many streaming sites, not just the one that the script is named
              after. This requires a recent version of youtube-dl to be installed on the system (default: yes).

              If the script can't do anything with an URL, it will do nothing.

              This accepts a set of options, which can be passed to it  with  the  <b>--script-opts</b>  option  (using
              <b>ytdl_hook-</b> as prefix):

              <b>try_ytdl_first=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
                     If  'yes' will try parsing the URL with youtube-dl first, instead of the default where it's
                     only after mpv failed to open it. This mostly depends on whether most  of  your  URLs  need
                     youtube-dl parsing.

              <b>exclude=&lt;URL1|URL2|...</b>
                     A  <b>|</b>-separated  list of URL patterns which mpv should not use with youtube-dl. The patterns
                     are matched after the <b>http(s)://</b> part of the URL.

                     <b>^</b> matches the beginning of the URL, <b>$</b> matches its end, and you should use <b>%</b> before  any  of
                     the characters <b>^$()%|,.[]*+-?</b> to match that character.

                     URLs are converted to lower case before matching.

                        Examples

                        • <b>--script-opts=ytdl_hook-exclude='^youtube%.com'</b>  will exclude any URL that starts with
                          <b><a href="http://youtube.com">http://youtube.com</a></b> or <b>https://youtube.com</b>.

                        • <b>--script-opts=ytdl_hook-exclude='%.mkv$|%.mp4$'</b> will exclude any URL  that  ends  with
                          <b>.mkv</b> or <b>.mp4</b>.

                     See more lua patterns here:  &lt;https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#5.4.1&gt;

              <b>include=&lt;URL1|URL2|...</b>
                     A <b>|</b>-separated list of URL patterns which mpv should try to parse with youtube-dl first when
                     <b>try_ytdl_first</b> is <b>no</b>. The patterns are matched in the same way as <b>exclude</b>.

                     Default: <b>^%w+%.youtube%.com/|^youtube%.com/|^youtu%.be/|^%w+%.twitch%.tv/|^twitch%.tv/</b>

              <b>all_formats=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
                     If  'yes'  will attempt to add all formats found reported by youtube-dl (default: no). Each
                     format is added as a separate track. In  addition,  they  are  delay-loaded,  and  actually
                     opened  only  when  a track is selected (this should keep load times as low as without this
                     option).

                     It adds average bitrate metadata, if available, which means you can  use  <b>--hls-bitrate</b>  to
                     decide  which  track  to  select. (HLS used to be the only format whose alternative quality
                     streams were exposed in a similar way, thus the option name.)

                     Tracks which represent formats that were selected by youtube-dl as default  will  have  the
                     default  flag  set.  This  means  mpv  should  generally  still  select formats chosen with
                     <b>--ytdl-format</b> by default.

                     Although this mechanism makes it possible to switch streams at runtime, it's  not  suitable
                     for  this  purpose for various technical reasons. (It's slow, which can't be really fixed.)
                     In general, this option is not useful, and was only added to show that it's possible.

                     There are two cases that must be considered when doing quality/bandwidth selection:

                        1. Completely separate audio and  video  streams  (DASH-like).  Each  of  these  streams
                           contain either only audio or video, so you can mix and combine audio/video bandwidths
                           without  restriction.  This  intuitively  matches  best with the concept of selecting
                           quality by track (what <b>all_formats</b> is supposed to do).

                        2. Separate sets of muxed audio and video streams. Each version of  the  media  contains
                           both  an  audio  and  video  stream,  and they are interleaved. In order not to waste
                           bandwidth, you should only select one of these versions (if, for example, you  select
                           an  audio  stream,  then  video will be downloaded, even if you selected video from a
                           different stream).

                           mpv will still represent them as separate tracks, but will  set  the  title  of  each
                           track  to  <b>muxed-N</b>,  where  <b>N</b>  is  replaced  with  the  youtube-dl  format  ID of the
                           originating stream.

                     Some sites will mix 1. and 2., but we assume that they do so for compatibility reasons, and
                     there is no reason to use them at all.

              <b>force_all_formats=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
                     If set to 'yes', and <b>all_formats</b> is also set to 'yes',  this  will  try  to  represent  all
                     youtube-dl  reported  formats  as  tracks,  even  if  mpv would normally use the direct URL
                     reported by it (default: yes).

                     It appears this normally makes a difference if youtube-dl works on a master HLS playlist.

                     If this is set to 'no', this specific kind of stream is treated like <b>all_formats</b> is set  to
                     'no', and the stream selection as done by youtube-dl (via <b>--ytdl-format</b>) is used.

              <b>thumbnails=&lt;all|best|none&gt;</b>
                     Add thumbnails as video tracks (default: none).

                     Thumbnails  get  downloaded  when  they are added as tracks, so 'all' can have a noticeable
                     impact on how long it takes to open the video when there are a lot of thumbnails.

              <b>use_manifests=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
                     Make mpv use the master manifest URL for formats like HLS and DASH, if available,  allowing
                     for  video/audio  selection  in  runtime (default: no). It's disabled ("no") by default for
                     performance reasons.

              <b>ytdl_path=youtube-dl</b>
                     Configure paths to youtube-dl's executable or a compatible  fork's.  The  paths  should  be
                     separated  by  :  on  Unix and ; on Windows. mpv looks in order for the configured paths in
                     PATH  and  in  mpv's  config  directory.   The  defaults  are  "yt-dlp",  "yt-dlp_x86"  and
                     "youtube-dl".  On  Windows  the  suffix  extension  is  not  necessary,  but only ".exe" is
                     acceptable.

                 Why do the option names mix <b>_</b> and <b>-</b>?

                        I have no idea.

       <b>--ytdl-format=&lt;ytdl|best|worst|mp4|webm|...&gt;</b>
              Video format/quality that is directly passed to youtube-dl. The possible values  are  specific  to
              the  website  and  the  video, for a given url the available formats can be found with the command
              <b>youtube-dl</b> <b>--list-formats</b> <b>URL</b>. See youtube-dl's documentation for  available  aliases.   (Default:
              <b>bestvideo+bestaudio/best</b>)

              The  <b>ytdl</b>  value  does not pass a <b>--format</b> option to youtube-dl at all, and thus does not override
              its default. Note that sometimes youtube-dl returns a format that mpv cannot  use,  and  in  these
              cases the mpv default may work better.

       <b>--ytdl-raw-options=&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;[,&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;[,...]]</b>
              Pass arbitrary options to youtube-dl. Parameter and argument should be passed as a key-value pair.
              Options without argument must include <b>=</b>.

              There  is no sanity checking so it's possible to break things (i.e.  passing invalid parameters to
              youtube-dl).

              A proxy URL can be passed for youtube-dl to use it in parsing the website.   This  is  useful  for
              geo-restricted  URLs.  After  youtube-dl  parsing, some URLs also require a proxy for playback, so
              this can pass that proxy information to mpv. Take note that SOCKS  proxies  aren't  supported  and
              https URLs also bypass the proxy. This is a limitation in FFmpeg.

              This is a key/value list option. See List Options for details.

                 Example

                 • <b>--ytdl-raw-options=username=user,password=pass</b>

                 • <b>--ytdl-raw-options=force-ipv6=</b>

                 • <b>--ytdl-raw-options=proxy=[<a href="http://127.0.0.1">http://127.0.0.1</a>:3128]</b>

                 • <b>--ytdl-raw-options-append=proxy=<a href="http://127.0.0.1">http://127.0.0.1</a>:3128</b>

       <b>--js-memory-report=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Enable  memory reporting for javascript scripts in the stats overlay.  This is disabled by default
              because it has an overhead and increases memory usage. This option will only work if it is enabled
              before mpv is started.

       <b>--load-stats-overlay=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Enable the builtin script that shows useful playback information on a key binding (default:  yes).
              By default, the <b>i</b> key is used (<b>I</b> to make the overlay permanent).

       <b>--load-console=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Enable the built-in script to handle textual input (default: yes).

       <b>--load-commands=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Enable  the built-in script to enter commands in the console (default: yes).  The <b>`</b> key is used to
              activate this by default.

       <b>--load-auto-profiles=&lt;yes|no|auto&gt;</b>
              Enable the builtin script that does auto profiles (default: auto). See Conditional  auto  profiles
              for  details.  <b>auto</b>  will  load  the script, but immediately unload it if there are no conditional
              profiles.

       <b>--load-select=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Enable the builtin script that lets you select from lists of items (default: yes). By default, its
              keybindings start with the <b>g</b> key.

       <b>--load-positioning=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Enable the builtin script that provides various keybindings to pan  videos  and  images  (default:
              yes).

       <b>--player-operation-mode=&lt;cplayer|pseudo-gui&gt;</b>
              For  enabling  "pseudo GUI mode", which means that the defaults for some options are changed. This
              option should not normally be used directly, but only by mpv internally, or mpv-provided  scripts,
              config files, or .desktop files. See PSEUDO GUI MODE for details.

   <b>Watch</b> <b>Later</b>
       <b>--save-position-on-quit</b>
              Always  save  the current playback position on quit, and also when the <b>loadfile</b> command is used to
              replace the current playlist. When this file is played again later, the player will  seek  to  the
              old  playback  position  on  start. This does not happen if playback of a file is stopped in other
              ways.  For example, going to the next file in the playlist will not save the  position,  and  will
              start playback at beginning the next time the file is played.

              This  behavior  is  disabled  by  default,  but  is always available when quitting the player with
              Shift+Q.

              See RESUMING PLAYBACK.

       <b>--watch-later-dir=&lt;path&gt;</b>
              The directory in which to store the "watch later" temporary files.

              <b>--watch-later-directory</b> is an alias for <b>--watch-later-dir</b>.

              If this option is unset, the files will be stored in a subdirectory named "watch_later" underneath
              the local state directory (usually <b><a href="file:~/.local/state/mpv/">~/.local/state/mpv/</a></b>).

       <b>--resume-playback=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Restore   playback   position   from   the   <b>watch_later</b>   configuration   subdirectory,   usually
              <b><a href="file:~/.config/mpv/watch_later/">~/.config/mpv/watch_later/</a></b> (default: yes).

       <b>--resume-playback-check-mtime=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Only  restore  the  playback  position  from  the  <b>watch_later</b> configuration subdirectory (usually
              <b><a href="file:~/.config/mpv/watch_later/">~/.config/mpv/watch_later/</a></b>) if the file's modification time is the same as at the time of  saving.
              This  may  prevent  skipping  forward  in  files  with the same name which have different content.
              (Default: <b>no</b>)

       <b>--watch-later-options=option1,option2,...</b>
              The options that are saved in "watch later" files  if  they  have  been  changed  since  when  mpv
              started.  These values will be restored the next time the files are played. Note that the playback
              position is saved via the <b>start</b> option.

              When removing options, existing watch later data won't be  modified  and  will  still  be  applied
              fully, but new watch later data won't contain these options.

              See <b>--help=watch-later-options</b> for the list of the properties that are restored by default.

              This is a string list option. See List Options for details.

                 Examples

                 • <b>--watch-later-options-remove=sid</b> The subtitle track selection will not be restored.

                 • <b>--watch-later-options-remove=volume</b>  <b>--watch-later-options-remove=mute</b>  The  volume  and mute
                   state won't be saved to watch later files.

                 • <b>--watch-later-options=start</b> No option will be saved to watch later files, except the playback
                   position.

   <b>Video</b>
       <b>--vo=&lt;driver&gt;</b>
              Specify the video output backend to be used. See VIDEO OUTPUT DRIVERS for details and descriptions
              of available drivers.

       <b>--vd=&lt;...&gt;</b>
              Specify a priority list of video decoders to be used, according to their family and name. See <b>--ad</b>
              for further details. Both of these options use the same syntax and semantics; the only  difference
              is that they operate on different codec lists.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 See <b>--vd=help</b> for a full list of available decoders.

       <b>--vf=&lt;filter1[=parameter1:parameter2:...],filter2,...&gt;</b>
              Specify  a  list  of video filters to apply to the video stream. See VIDEO FILTERS for details and
              descriptions of the available filters.  The option variants <b>--vf-add</b>, <b>--vf-pre</b>, and <b>--vf-clr</b> exist
              to modify a previously specified list, but you should not need these for typical use.

       <b>--untimed</b>
              Do not sleep when outputting video frames. Useful for benchmarks when used with <b>--audio=no</b>.

       <b>--framedrop=&lt;mode&gt;</b>
              Skip displaying some frames to maintain A/V sync on slow systems, or playing high framerate  video
              on video outputs that have an upper framerate limit.

              The argument selects the drop methods, and can be one of the following:

              <b>&lt;no&gt;</b>   Disable any frame dropping. Not recommended, for testing only.

              <b>&lt;vo&gt;</b>   Drop  late frames on video output (default). This still decodes and filters all frames, but
                     doesn't render them on the VO. Drops are indicated in the terminal status line as  <b>Dropped:</b>
                     field.

                     In  audio  sync.  mode,  this drops frames that are outdated at the time of display. If the
                     decoder is too slow, in theory all frames would have to be dropped (because all frames  are
                     too  late)  -  to  avoid this, frame dropping stops  if the effective framerate is below 10
                     FPS.

                     In display-sync. modes (see <b>--video-sync</b>), this affects  only  how  A/V  drops  or  repeats
                     frames.  If  this  mode  is disabled, A/V desync will in theory not affect video scheduling
                     anymore (much like the <b>display-resample-desync</b> mode). However,  even  if  disabled,  frames
                     will  still  be  skipped  (i.e.  dropped)  according to the ratio between video and display
                     frequencies.

                     This is the recommended mode, and the default.

              <b>&lt;decoder&gt;</b>
                     Old, decoder-based framedrop mode. (This is the same as <b>--framedrop=yes</b> in  mpv  0.5.x  and
                     before.)  This  tells  the  decoder to skip frames (unless they are needed to decode future
                     frames). May help with slow systems, but can produce unwatchable  choppy  output,  or  even
                     freeze the display completely.

                     This  uses  a  heuristic  which  may  not  make  sense, and in  general cannot achieve good
                     results, because the decoder's frame dropping cannot be controlled in a predictable manner.
                     Not recommended.

                     Even if you want to use this, prefer <b>decoder+vo</b> for better results.

                     The <b>--vd-lavc-framedrop</b> option controls what frames to drop.

              <b>&lt;decoder+vo&gt;</b>
                     Enable both modes. Not recommended. Better than just <b>decoder</b> mode.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 <b>--vo=vdpau</b> has its own code for the <b>vo</b> framedrop mode. Slight  differences  to  other  VOs  are
                 possible.

       <b>--video-latency-hacks=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Enable  some  things  which tend to reduce video latency by 1 or 2 frames (default: no). Note that
              this option might be removed without notice once the player's timing code does not inherently need
              to do these  things  anymore.  Using  this  option  is  known  to  break  other  options  such  as
              interpolation, so it is not recommended to enable this.

              This does:

              • Use  the  demuxer  reported  FPS  for frame dropping. This avoids the player needing to decode 1
                frame in advance, lowering total latency in effect. This also means that if the demuxer reported
                FPS is wrong, or the video filter chain changes FPS (e.g. deinterlacing), then it could drop too
                many or not enough frames.

              • Disable waiting for the first video frame. Normally the player waits for the first  video  frame
                to  be  fully  rendered before starting playback properly. Some VOs will lazily initialize stuff
                when rendering the first frame, so if this is not done, there is some likeliness that the VO has
                to drop some frames if rendering the first frame takes longer than needed.

       <b>--display-fps-override=&lt;fps&gt;</b>
              Set the display FPS used with the <b>--video-sync=display-*</b> modes. By default, a  detected  value  is
              used.  Keep  in  mind  that setting an incorrect value (even if slightly incorrect) can ruin video
              playback. On multi-monitor systems, there is a chance that the detected value is  from  the  wrong
              monitor.

              Set this option only if you have reason to believe the automatically determined value is wrong.

       <b>--hwdec=&lt;api1,api2,...|no|auto|auto-copy&gt;</b>
              Specify  the  hardware  video  decoding  API  that  should  be used if possible.  Whether hardware
              decoding is actually done depends on the video codec. If hardware decoding is  not  possible,  mpv
              will fall back on software decoding.

              Hardware  decoding is not enabled by default, to keep the out-of-the-box configuration as reliable
              as possible. However, when using modern hardware, hardware video decoding should  work  correctly,
              offering  reduced  CPU  usage,  and  possibly lower power consumption. On older systems, it may be
              necessary to use hardware decoding due to insufficient CPU resources; and even on modern  systems,
              sufficiently complex content (eg: 4K60 AV1) may require it.

              This is a string list option. See List Options for details.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Use  the <b>Ctrl+h</b> shortcut to toggle hardware decoding at runtime. It toggles this option between
                 <b>auto</b> and <b>no</b>.

                 If you decide you want to use hardware decoding by default, the general  recommendation  is  to
                 try  out  decoding with the command line option, and prove to yourself that it works as desired
                 for the content you care about. After that, you can add it to your config file.

                 When testing, you should start by using <b>hwdec=auto</b> as it will limit  itself  to  choosing  from
                 hwdecs  that  are actively supported by the development team. If that doesn't result in working
                 hardware decoding, you can try <b>hwdec=auto-unsafe</b> to have it  attempt  to  load  every  possible
                 hwdec, but if <b>auto</b> didn't work, you will probably need to know exactly which hwdec matches your
                 hardware and read up on that entry below.

                 If  <b>auto</b>  produced the desired results, we recommend just sticking with that and only setting a
                 specific hwdec in your config file if it is really necessary.

                 If you use the Ubuntu package, keep in mind that their <b>/etc/mpv/mpv.conf</b> contains  <b>hwdec=vaapi</b>,
                 which  is  less than ideal as it may not be the right choice for your system, and it may end up
                 using an inefficient wrapper library under the covers.  We  recommend  removing  this  line  or
                 deleting the file altogether.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Even   if  enabled,  hardware  decoding  is  still  only  white-listed  for  some  codecs.  See
                 <b>--hwdec-codecs</b> to enable hardware decoding in more cases.

                 Which method to choose?

                 • If you only want to enable hardware decoding at runtime, don't  set  the  parameter,  or  put
                   <b>hwdec=no</b> into your <b>mpv.conf</b> (relevant on distros which force-enable it by default, such as on
                   Ubuntu). Use the <b>Ctrl+h</b> default binding to enable it at runtime.

                 • If  you're not sure, but want hardware decoding always enabled by default, put <b>hwdec=yes</b> into
                   your <b>mpv.conf</b>, and acknowledge that this may cause problems.

                 • If you want to test available hardware decoding methods, pass <b>--hwdec=auto</b> <b>--hwdec-codecs=all</b>
                   and look at the terminal output.

                 • If you're a developer, or want to perform elaborate tests, you may  need  any  of  the  other
                   possible option values.

              This option accepts a comma delimited list of <b>api</b> types, along with certain special values:

              <b>no</b>     always use software decoding (default)

              <b>auto</b>   enable any whitelisted hw decoder (see below)

              <b>auto-unsafe</b>
                     forcibly enable any hw decoder found (see below)

              <b>yes</b>    exactly the same as <b>auto</b>

              <b>auto-safe</b>
                     exactly the same as <b>auto</b>

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Special  values  can  be mixed with api names. eg: <b>vaapi,auto</b> will try and use the <b>vaapi</b> hwdec,
                 and if that fails, will run through the normal <b>auto</b> logic.

              <b>auto</b>  tries to automatically enable hardware decoding using the first available method, but allows
              only whitelisted methods that are considered "safe". This is supposed to be a  reasonable  way  to
              enable  hardware  decoding  by default in a config file (even though you shouldn't do that anyway;
              prefer runtime enabling with <b>Ctrl+h</b>). Unlike <b>auto-unsafe</b>, this will not try to enable  unknown  or
              known-to-be-bad  methods. In addition, this may disable hardware decoding in other situations when
              it's known to cause problems, but currently this mechanism is quite primitive. (As an example  for
              something that still causes problems: certain combinations of HEVC and Intel chips on Windows tend
              to cause mpv to crash, most likely due to driver bugs.)

              <b>auto-unsafe</b>  is  similar to <b>auto</b>, but without the whitelist.  In general, you should never need to
              use this beyond debugging or development use. Any known unsafe hwdec you want to test  can  simply
              be  appended to the list option such as <b>--hwdec=auto,unsafe-hwdec</b>.  This still depends what VO you
              are using. See the list above, for which <b>--vo</b> and <b>gpu-context</b> is required for a  given  hwdec.  It
              will  go  down  the list of available hwdecs until one is successfully initialised. If all of them
              fail, it will fallback to software decoding.

              <b>auto-copy</b> selects only modes that copy the video data back to system memory after  decoding.  This
              selects  modes  like  <b>vaapi-copy</b>  (and  so  on),  but  it only allows whitelisted methods that are
              considered "safe". If none of these work, hardware decoding is  disabled.  This  mode  is  usually
              guaranteed  to  incur  no  additional  quality loss compared to software decoding (assuming modern
              codecs and an error free video stream), and will allow CPU processing  with  video  filters.  This
              mode works with all video filters and VOs.

              <b>auto-copy-safe</b> is an alias for <b>auto-copy</b>

              <b>auto-copy-unsafe</b> is the same as <b>auto-copy</b> except that it goes through all methods and not just the
              whitelisted ones that are considered "safe".

              Because  these  copy  the  decoded video back to system RAM, they're often less efficient than the
              direct modes, and may not help too much over software decoding if you are short on CPU resources.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Most non-copy methods only work with the OpenGL GPU backend. Currently, only the <b>vaapi</b>,  <b>nvdec</b>,
                 <b>cuda</b> and <b>vulkan</b> methods work with Vulkan.

              The  <b>vaapi</b>  mode, if used with <b>--vo=gpu</b> or <b>--vo=gpu-next</b> most likely works with Intel and AMD GPUs
              only. It requires the opengl EGL backend if the GPU does not support drm modifiers.

              <b>nvdec</b> and <b>nvdec-copy</b> are the newest, and recommended method to  do  hardware  decoding  on  Nvidia
              GPUs.

              <b>cuda</b>  and  <b>cuda-copy</b>  are  an  older  implementation of hardware decoding on Nvidia GPUs that uses
              Nvidia's bitstream parsers rather than FFmpeg's.  This can lead to feature deficiencies,  such  as
              incorrect  playback  of  HDR  content,  and <b>nvdec</b>/<b>nvdec-copy</b> should always be preferred unless you
              specifically need Nvidia's deinterlacing algorithms. To use this deinterlacing you must  pass  the
              option:  <b>vd-lavc-o=deint=[weave|bob|adaptive]</b>.   Pass  <b>weave</b>  (or  leave  the option unset) to not
              attempt any deinterlacing.

                 Quality reduction with hardware decoding

                        In theory, hardware decoding does not reduce video quality (at least for the codecs h264
                        and HEVC). However, due to restrictions in video output APIs, as well  as  bugs  in  the
                        actual  hardware  decoders, there can be some loss, or even blatantly incorrect results.
                        This has largely ceased to be a problem with modern hardware, but  there  is  a  lot  of
                        hardware  out  there, so caveat emptor. Known problems are discussed below, but the list
                        cannot be considered exhaustive, as even hwdecs  that  work  well  on  certain  hardware
                        generations may be problematic on other ones.

                        In  some cases, RGB conversion is forced, which means the RGB conversion is performed by
                        the hardware decoding API, instead of the shaders used by <b>--vo=gpu</b>. This  means  certain
                        colorspaces  may not display correctly, and certain filtering (such as debanding) cannot
                        be applied in an ideal way. This will also usually force the use of low  quality  chroma
                        scalers  instead of the one specified by <b>--cscale</b>. In other cases, hardware decoding can
                        also reduce the bit depth of the decoded image, which can introduce banding or precision
                        loss for 10-bit files.

                        <b>vdpau</b> always does RGB conversion in hardware, which does not support  newer  colorspaces
                        like BT.2020 correctly. However, <b>vdpau</b> doesn't support 10 bit or HDR encodings, so these
                        limitations are unlikely to be relevant.

                        <b>dxva2</b> is not safe. It appears to always use BT.601 for forced RGB conversion, but actual
                        behavior  depends  on  the  GPU drivers. Some drivers appear to convert to limited range
                        RGB, which gives a faded appearance.  In addition to  driver-specific  behavior,  global
                        system  settings  might  affect  this additionally. This can give incorrect results even
                        with completely ordinary video sources.

                        <b>mediacodec</b> is not safe. It forces RGB conversion  (not  with  <b>-copy</b>)  and  how  well  it
                        handles  non-standard  colorspaces  is  not  known.   In  the rare cases where 10-bit is
                        supported the bit depth of the output will be reduced to 8.

                        <b>cuda</b> should usually be safe, but depending on how a file/stream has been mixed,  it  has
                        been  reported  to corrupt the timestamps causing glitched, flashing frames. It can also
                        sometimes cause massive framedrops for unknown reasons. Caution is  advised,  and  <b>nvdec</b>
                        should always be preferred.

                        <b>crystalhd</b> is not safe. It always converts to 4:2:2 YUV, which may be lossy, depending on
                        how  chroma  sub-sampling is done during conversion. It also discards the top left pixel
                        of each frame for some reason.

                        If you run into any weird decoding issues, frame glitches or discoloration, and you have
                        <b>--hwdec</b> turned on, the first thing you should try is disabling it.

       <b>--gpu-hwdec-interop=&lt;auto|all|no|name&gt;</b>
              This option is for troubleshooting hwdec interop  issues.  Since  it's  a  debugging  option,  its
              semantics may change at any time.

              This  is  useful  for  the  <b>gpu</b>  and  <b>libmpv</b>  VOs for selecting which hwdec interop context to use
              exactly. Effectively it also can be used to block loading of certain backends.

              If set to <b>auto</b> (default), the behavior depends on the VO:  for  <b>gpu</b>,  it  does  nothing,  and  the
              interop  context  is  loaded  on demand (when the decoder probes for <b>--hwdec</b> support). For <b>libmpv</b>,
              which has has no on-demand loading, this is equivalent to <b>all</b>.

              The empty string is equivalent to <b>auto</b>.

              If set to <b>all</b>, it attempts to load all interop contexts at GL context creation time.

              Other than that, a specific backend can be set, and the list of them can be queried with <b>help</b> (mpv
              CLI only).

              Runtime changes to this are ignored (the current option value is used  whenever  the  renderer  is
              created).

       <b>--hwdec-extra-frames=&lt;N&gt;</b>
              Number of GPU frames hardware decoding should preallocate (default: see <b>--list-options</b> output). If
              this  is  too  low,  frame allocation may fail during decoding, and video frames might get dropped
              and/or corrupted.  Setting it too high simply wastes GPU memory and has no advantages.

              This value is used only for hardware decoding APIs which  require  preallocating  surfaces  (known
              examples  include <b>d3d11va</b> and <b>vaapi</b>).  For other APIs, frames are allocated as needed. The details
              depend on the libavcodec implementations of the hardware decoders.

              The required number of surfaces depends on dynamic runtime situations.  The  default  is  a  fixed
              value  that  is  thought  to be sufficient for most uses. But in certain situations, it may not be
              enough.

       <b>--hwdec-image-format=&lt;name&gt;</b>
              Set the internal pixel format used by hardware decoding via  <b>--hwdec</b>  (default  <b>no</b>).  The  special
              value  <b>no</b> selects an implementation specific standard format. Most decoder implementations support
              only one format, and will fail to initialize if the format is not supported.

              Some implementations might support multiple formats.  In  particular,  videotoolbox  is  known  to
              require <b>uyvy422</b> for good performance on some older hardware. d3d11va can always use <b>yuv420p</b>, which
              uses an opaque format, with likely no advantages.

       <b>--cuda-decode-device=&lt;auto|0..&gt;</b>
              Choose  the  GPU  device used for decoding when using the <b>cuda</b> or <b>nvdec</b> hwdecs with the OpenGL GPU
              backend, and with the <b>cuda-copy</b> or <b>nvdec-copy</b> hwdecs in all cases.

              For the OpenGL GPU backend, the default device used for decoding is the one being used to  provide
              <b>gpu</b> output (and in the vast majority of cases, only one GPU will be present).

              For  the <b>copy</b> hwdecs, the default device will be the first device enumerated by the CUDA libraries
              - however that is done.

              For the Vulkan GPU backend, decoding must always happen on the display device, and this option has
              no effect.

       <b>--vaapi-device=&lt;device</b> <b>file|adapter</b> <b>name&gt;</b>
              Choose the DRM device for <b>vaapi-copy</b>. This should be the path to  a  DRM  device  file.  (Default:
              <b>/dev/dri/renderD128</b>)

              On  Windows  this  takes  adapter  name  as  an  input.  Will  pick  the default adapter if unset.
              Alternatives are listed when the name "help" is given.

       <b>--panscan=&lt;0.0-1.0&gt;</b>
              Enables pan-and-scan functionality (cropping the sides of e.g. a 16:9 video to make it fit  a  4:3
              display  without  black  bands). The range controls how much of the image is cropped. May not work
              with all video output drivers.

              This option has no effect if <b>--video-unscaled</b> option is used.

              The difference between <b>--panscan</b> and <b>--video-zoom</b> is that <b>--panscan</b> can only zoom in until  either
              the  video  width  or  height  fills  the  window, while <b>--video-zoom</b> can zoom in or out arbitrary
              amounts, and also works with <b>--video-unscaled</b>.

       <b>--video-aspect-override=&lt;ratio|no&gt;</b>
              Override video aspect ratio, in case aspect information is incorrect or missing in the file  being
              played.

              These values have special meaning:

              <b>no</b>     use the method of the <b>--video-aspect-method</b> option (default)

              <b>0</b>      disable  aspect  ratio  handling,  pretend  the  video  has  square pixels (deprecated, use
                     <b>--video-aspect-override=no</b> <b>--video-aspect-method=ignore</b> instead)

              <b>-1</b>     strictly prefer the container  aspect  ratio  (deprecated,  use  <b>--video-aspect-override=no</b>
                     <b>--video-aspect-method=container</b> instead)

              But note that handling of these special values might change in the future.

                 Examples

                 • <b>--video-aspect-override=4:3</b>  or <b>--video-aspect-override=1.3333</b>

                 • <b>--video-aspect-override=16:9</b> or <b>--video-aspect-override=1.7777</b>

                 • <b>--no-video-aspect-override</b> or <b>--video-aspect-override=no</b>

       <b>--video-aspect-method=&lt;bitstream|container|ignore&gt;</b>
              This  sets the default video aspect determination method (if the aspect is _not_ overridden by the
              user with <b>--video-aspect-override</b> or others).

              <b>container</b>
                     Strictly prefer the container aspect ratio. This is apparently the  default  behavior  with
                     VLC,  at  least  with  Matroska.  Note  that  if the container has no aspect ratio set, the
                     behavior is the same as with bitstream.

              <b>bitstream</b>
                     Strictly prefer the bitstream aspect ratio, unless the bitstream aspect ratio is  not  set.
                     This is apparently the default behavior with XBMC/kodi, at least with Matroska.

              <b>ignore</b> Disable aspect ratio handling, pretend the video has square pixels.

              The current default for mpv is <b>container</b>.

              Normally  you  should  not  set  this. Try the various choices if you encounter video that has the
              wrong aspect ratio in mpv, but seems to be correct in other players.

       <b>--video-unscaled=&lt;no|yes|downscale-big&gt;</b>
              Disable scaling of the video. If the window is larger  than  the  video,  black  bars  are  added.
              Otherwise,  the  video  is  cropped,  unless the option is set to <b>downscale-big</b>, in which case the
              video is fit to window. The video still can be influenced by the other <b>--video-...</b>  options.  This
              option disables the effect of <b>--panscan</b>.

              Note  that  the  scaler  algorithm may still be used, even if the video isn't scaled. For example,
              this can influence chroma conversion. The video will also still be scaled in one dimension if  the
              source uses non-square pixels (e.g. anamorphic widescreen DVDs).

              This option is disabled if <b>--keepaspect=no</b> is used.

       <b>--video-pan-x=&lt;value&gt;,</b> <b>--video-pan-y=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Moves  the  displayed  video  rectangle by the given value in the X or Y direction. The unit is in
              fractions of the size of the scaled video (the full size, even if  parts  of  the  video  are  not
              visible due to panscan or other options).

              For  example,  displaying  a  video fullscreen on a 1920x1080 screen with <b>--video-pan-x=-0.1</b> would
              move the video 192 pixels to the left and <b>--video-pan-y=-0.1</b> would move the video 108 pixels up.

              This option is disabled if <b>--keepaspect=no</b> is used.

       <b>--video-rotate=&lt;0-359|no&gt;</b>
              Rotate the video clockwise, in degrees. If <b>no</b> is given, the video is never rotated,  even  if  the
              file has rotation metadata. (The rotation value is added to the rotation metadata, which means the
              value <b>0</b> would rotate the video according to the rotation metadata.)

              When  using  hardware decoding without copy-back, only 90° steps work, while software decoding and
              hardware decoding methods that copy the video back to system memory support all values  between  0
              and 359.

       <b>--video-crop=&lt;[W[xH]][+x+y]&gt;,</b> <b>--video-crop=&lt;x:y&gt;</b>
              Crop  the  video by starting at the x, y offset for w, h pixels. The crop is applied to the source
              video rectangle (before anamorphic stretch) by the VO.  A crop rectangle that is  not  within  the
              video  rectangle will be ignored.  This works with hwdec, unlike the equivalent 'lavfi-crop'. When
              offset  is  omitted,  the  central  area  will  be  cropped.  Setting  the  crop  to   empty   one
              <b>--video-crop=0x0+0+0</b>  overrides  container  crop  and  disables  cropping.   Setting  the  crop to
              <b>--video-crop=""</b> disables manual cropping and restores the container crop if it's specified.

       <b>--video-zoom=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Adjust the video display scale factor by the given value.  The  parameter  is  given  log  2.  For
              example,  <b>--video-zoom=0</b>  is  unscaled,  <b>--video-zoom=1</b>  is twice the size, <b>--video-zoom=-2</b> is one
              fourth of the size, and so on.

              This option is disabled if <b>--keepaspect=no</b> is used.

       <b>--video-scale-x=&lt;value&gt;,</b> <b>--video-scale-y=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Multiply the video display size with the given value (default: 1.0). If  a  non-default  value  is
              used,  this will be different from the window size, so video will be either cut off, or black bars
              are added.

              This value is multiplied with the value derived from <b>--video-zoom</b>  and  the  normal  video  aspect
              ratio. This option is disabled if <b>--keepaspect=no</b> is used.

       <b>--video-align-x=&lt;-1-1&gt;,</b> <b>--video-align-y=&lt;-1-1&gt;</b>
              When  the  video  is  bigger than the window, these move the displayed rectangle to show different
              parts of the video. <b>--video-align-y=-1</b> would display the top of the video,  <b>0</b>  would  display  the
              center (default), and <b>1</b> would display the bottom.

              When  the  video is smaller than the window and <b>--video-recenter</b> is disabled, these move the video
              rectangle within the black borders, which are usually added to pad the  video  to  the  window  if
              video  and  window aspect ratios are different. <b>--video-align-y=-1</b> would move the video to the top
              of the window (leaving a border only on the bottom), <b>0</b> would center it, and <b>1</b> would put the  video
              at the bottom of the window.

              If video and screen aspect match perfectly, these options do nothing.

              Unlike  <b>--video-pan-x</b>  and <b>--video-pan-y</b>, these don't go beyond the video's or window's boundaries
              or make the displayed rectangle drift off after zooming.

              This option is disabled if <b>--keepaspect=no</b> is used.

       <b>--video-recenter=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Whether to behave as if <b>--video-align-x</b> and <b>--video-align-y</b> were 0 when the video becomes  smaller
              than the window in the respective direction

              After  zooming  in  until  the  video  is  bigger  the window, panning with <u>--video-align-x</u> and/or
              <u>--video-align-y</u>, and zooming out until the video is smaller than the window,  this  is  useful  to
              recenter the video in the window.

              Default: no.

       <b>--video-margin-ratio-left=&lt;val&gt;,</b> <b>--video-margin-ratio-right=&lt;val&gt;,</b> <b>--video-margin-ratio-top=&lt;val&gt;,</b>
       <b>--video-margin-ratio-bottom=&lt;val&gt;</b>
              Set  extra  video  margins  on each border (default: 0). Each value is a ratio of the window size,
              using a range 0.0-1.0. For example, setting the option <b>--video-margin-ratio-right=0.2</b> at a  window
              size of 1000 pixels will add a 200 pixels border on the right side of the window.

              The  video  is "boxed" by these margins. The window size is not changed. In particular it does not
              enlarge the window, and the margins will cause the video to be downscaled by default. This may  or
              may not change in the future.

              The margins are applied after 90° video rotation, but before any other video transformations.

              This option is disabled if <b>--keepaspect=no</b> is used.

              Subtitles still may use the margins, depending on <b>--sub-use-margins</b> and similar options.

              These  options  were  created  for the OSC. Some odd decisions, such as making the margin values a
              ratio (instead of pixels), were made for the sake of the OSC. It's possible that these options may
              be replaced by ones that are more generally useful. The behavior of these options  may  change  to
              fit OSC requirements better, too.

       <b>--correct-pts=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              <b>--correct-pts=no</b>  switches  mpv to a mode where video timing is determined using a fixed framerate
              value (either using the <b>--container-fps-override</b> option, or using  file  information).  Sometimes,
              files  with  very  broken  timestamps  can  be played somewhat well in this mode.  Note that video
              filters,  subtitle  rendering,  seeking  (including  hr-seeks   and   backstepping),   and   audio
              synchronization can be completely broken in this mode.

       <b>--container-fps-override=&lt;float&gt;</b>
              Override video framerate. Useful if the original value is wrong or missing.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Works in <b>--correct-pts=no</b> mode only.

       <b>--deinterlace=&lt;yes|no|auto&gt;</b>
              Enable  or  disable deinterlacing (default: no).  Interlaced video shows ugly comb-like artifacts,
              which are visible on fast movement. Enabling this typically inserts  the  bwdif  video  filter  in
              order to deinterlace the video, or lets the video output apply deinterlacing if supported.

              When  using <b>auto</b>, mpv will insert a deinterlacing filter if ffmpeg detects that the video frame is
              interlaced. Be aware that there can be false positives in certain cases, such as  when  files  are
              encoded as interlaced despite the video not actually being so. This is why <b>auto</b> is not the default
              value.

              Keep  in  mind  that  using  this  filter  <b>will</b>  conflict with any manually inserted deinterlacing
              filters, and that this will make video look worse if it's not actually interlaced.

       <b>--deinterlace-field-parity=&lt;tff|bff|auto&gt;</b>
              Specify the field parity/order when deinterlacing (default: auto).  Each frame  of  an  interlaced
              video is divided into two fields, which are then separately transmitted. Top field represents even
              lines  while  bottom field represents odd lines. When deinterlacing the deinterlacer needs to know
              the correct temporal order of the fields else the video will appear jittery.

              <b>auto</b> will automatically try to detect the field order of the video, <b>tff</b>  forces  top  field  first
              while <b>bff</b> forces bottom field first.

       <b>--frames=&lt;number&gt;</b>
              Play/convert only first <b>&lt;number&gt;</b> video frames, then quit.

              <b>--frames=0</b>  loads  the  file, but immediately quits before initializing playback. (Might be useful
              for scripts which just want to determine some file properties.)

              For  audio-only  playback,  any  value  greater  than  0  will  quit  playback  immediately  after
              initialization. The value 0 works as with video.

       <b>--video-output-levels=&lt;outputlevels&gt;</b>
              RGB color levels used with YUV to RGB conversion. Normally, output devices such as PC monitors use
              full  range color levels. However, some TVs and video monitors expect studio RGB levels. Providing
              full range output to a device expecting studio level input results in crushed blacks  and  whites,
              the reverse in dim gray blacks and dim whites.

              Not all VOs support this option. Some will silently ignore it.

              Available color ranges are:

              <b>auto</b>   automatic selection (equals to full range) (default)

              <b>limited</b>
                     limited range (16-235 per component), studio levels

              <b>full</b>   full range (0-255 per component), PC levels

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 It is advisable to use your graphics driver's color range option instead, if available.

       <b>--hwdec-codecs=&lt;codec1,codec2,...|all&gt;</b>
              Allow  hardware  decoding for a given list of codecs only. The special value <b>all</b> always allows all
              codecs.

              You can get the list of allowed codecs with <b>mpv</b> <b>--vd=help</b>. Remove  the  prefix,  e.g.  instead  of
              <b>lavc:h264</b> use <b>h264</b>.

              By  default,  this is set to <b>h264,vc1,hevc,vp8,vp9,av1,prores</b>. Note that the hardware acceleration
              special codecs like <b>h264_vdpau</b> are not relevant anymore, and in fact have been removed from FFmpeg
              in this form.

              This is usually only needed with broken GPUs, where a codec is reported as supported, but decoding
              causes more problems than it solves.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 On some broken drivers (e.g. NVIDIA on Linux), probing  for  codecs  which  the  GPU  does  not
                 support  can  unnecessarily  slow  down  video  playback  initialization.  To  alleviate  this,
                 explicitly specify a list which only includes the codecs supported on the setup.

                 Example

                 <b>mpv</b> <b>--hwdec=vdpau</b> <b>--hwdec-codecs=h264,mpeg2video</b>
                        Enable vdpau decoding for h264 and mpeg2 only.

       <b>--hwdec-software-fallback=&lt;yes|no|N&gt;</b>
              Fallback to software decoding if the hardware-accelerated decoder fails (default: 3). If this is a
              number, then fallback will be triggered if N frames fail to decode in a row. 1  is  equivalent  to
              <b>yes</b>.

              Setting  this  to  a higher number might break the playback start fallback: if a fallback happens,
              parts of the file will be skipped, approximately by to the number of packets  that  could  not  be
              decoded.  Values  below  an  unspecified count will not have this problem, because mpv retains the
              packets.

       <b>--vd-lavc-check-hw-profile=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Check hardware decoder profile (default: yes). If <b>no</b> is set, the highest profile of  the  hardware
              decoder  is  unconditionally  selected, and decoding is forced even if the profile of the video is
              higher than that.  The result is most likely broken decoding, but may also help if the detected or
              reported profiles are somehow incorrect.

       <b>--vd-lavc-film-grain=&lt;auto|cpu|gpu&gt;</b>
              Enables film grain application on the GPU. If video decoding is done on the CPU, doing film  grain
              application  on the GPU can speed up decoding.  This option can also help hardware decoding, as it
              can reduce the number of frame copies done.

              By default, it's set to <b>auto</b>, so if the VO supports  film  grain  application,  then  it  will  be
              treated as <b>gpu</b>. If the VO does not support this, then it will be treated as <b>cpu</b>, regardless of the
              setting.  Currently, only <b>gpu-next</b> supports film grain application.

       <b>--vd-lavc-dr=&lt;auto|yes|no&gt;</b>
              Enable direct rendering (default: auto). If this is set to <b>yes</b>, the video will be decoded directly
              to GPU video memory (or staging buffers).  This can speed up video upload, and may help with large
              resolutions or slow hardware. This works only with the following VOs:

                 • <b>gpu</b>: requires at least OpenGL 4.4 or Vulkan.

                 • <b>libmpv</b>: The libmpv render API has optional support.

              The  <b>auto</b> option will try to guess whether DR can improve performance on your particular hardware.
              Currently this enables it on AMD or NVIDIA if using OpenGL or unconditionally if using Vulkan.

              Using video filters of any kind that write to the image data (or output  newly  allocated  frames)
              will silently disable the DR code path.

       <b>--vd-lavc-bitexact</b>
              Only use bit-exact algorithms in all decoding steps (for codec testing).

       <b>--vd-lavc-fast</b> <b>(MPEG-1/2</b> <b>and</b> <b>H.264</b> <b>only)</b>
              Enable  optimizations  which  do  not  comply  with the format specification and potentially cause
              problems, like simpler dequantization, simpler motion compensation, assuming use  of  the  default
              quantization matrix, assuming YUV 4:2:0 and skipping a few checks to detect damaged bitstreams.

       <b>--vd-lavc-o=&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;[,&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;[,...]]</b>
              Pass  AVOptions  to libavcodec decoder. Note, a patch to make the <b>o=</b> unneeded and pass all unknown
              options through the AVOption system is welcome. A full list of  AVOptions  can  be  found  in  the
              FFmpeg manual.

              Some options which used to be direct options can be set with this mechanism, like <b>bug</b>, <b>gray</b>, <b>idct</b>,
              <b>ec</b>, <b>vismv</b>, <b>skip_top</b> (was <b>st</b>), <b>skip_bottom</b> (was <b>sb</b>), <b>debug</b>.

              This is a key/value list option. See List Options for details.

                 Example

                        <b>--vd-lavc-o=debug=pict</b>

       <b>--vd-lavc-show-all=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Show  even  broken/corrupt  frames  (default:  no).  If this option is set to no, libavcodec won't
              output frames that were either decoded before an initial keyframe was decoded, or frames that  are
              recognized as corrupted.

       <b>--vd-lavc-skiploopfilter=&lt;skipvalue&gt;</b> <b>(H.264,</b> <b>HEVC</b> <b>only)</b>
              Skips the loop filter (AKA deblocking) during decoding. Since the filtered frame is supposed to be
              used as reference for decoding dependent frames, this has a worse effect on quality than not doing
              deblocking  on  e.g. MPEG-2 video. But at least for high bitrate HDTV, this provides a big speedup
              with little visible quality loss.  Codecs other than H.264 or HEVC may have  partial  support  for
              this option (often only <b>all</b> and <b>none</b>).

              <b>&lt;skipvalue&gt;</b> can be one of the following:

              <b>none</b>   Never skip.

              <b>default</b>
                     Skip useless processing steps (e.g. 0 size packets in AVI).

              <b>nonref</b> Skip  frames  that  are  not referenced (i.e. not used for decoding other frames, the error
                     cannot "build up").

              <b>bidir</b>  Skip B-Frames.

              <b>nonkey</b> Skip all frames except keyframes.

              <b>all</b>    Skip all frames.

       <b>--vd-lavc-skipidct=&lt;skipvalue&gt;</b> <b>(MPEG-1/2/4</b> <b>only)</b>
              Skips the IDCT step. This degrades quality a lot in  almost  all  cases  (see  skiploopfilter  for
              available skip values).

       <b>--vd-lavc-skipframe=&lt;skipvalue&gt;</b>
              Skips  decoding  of  frames  completely. Big speedup, but jerky motion and sometimes bad artifacts
              (see skiploopfilter for available skip values).

       <b>--vd-lavc-framedrop=&lt;skipvalue&gt;</b>
              Set framedropping mode used with <b>--framedrop</b> (see skiploopfilter for available skip values).

       <b>--vd-lavc-threads=&lt;N&gt;</b>
              Number of threads to use for decoding. Whether threading is actually supported  depends  on  codec
              (default: 0). 0 means autodetect number of cores on the machine and use that, up to the maximum of
              16. You can set more than 16 threads manually.

       <b>--vd-lavc-assume-old-x264=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Assume  the  video  was  encoded  by  an old, buggy x264 version (default: no).  Normally, this is
              autodetected by libavcodec. But if the bitstream contains no x264 version info (or it was  somehow
              skipped), and the stream was in fact encoded by an old x264 version (build 150 or earlier), and if
              the  stream  uses 4:4:4 chroma, then libavcodec will by default show corrupted video.  This option
              sets the libavcodec <b>x264_build</b> option to <b>150</b>, which means that if the stream contains  no  version
              info,  or  was  not encoded by x264 at all, it assumes it was encoded by the old version. Enabling
              this option is pretty safe if you want your broken files to work, but in theory this can break  on
              streams  not  encoded  by x264, or if a stream encoded by a newer x264 version contains no version
              info.

       <b>--vd-apply-cropping</b>
              Certain video codecs support cropping, meaning that only a sub-rectangle of the decoded  frame  is
              intended  for display. This option controls how cropping is handled by libavcodec. Cropping during
              decoding has certain limitations with regards to alignment and hardware decoding. If  this  option
              is enabled, decoder will apply the crop, else VO will handle it. Enabled by default.

       <b>--swapchain-depth=&lt;N&gt;</b>
              Allow  up  to  N  in-flight  frames.  This  essentially controls the frame latency. Increasing the
              swapchain depth can improve pipelining and prevent missed vsyncs, but increases  visible  latency.
              This  option  only  mandates  an  upper  limit,  the  implementation  can use a lower latency than
              requested internally. A setting of 1 means that the VO will wait for every frame to become visible
              before starting to render the next frame. (Default: 3)

   <b>Audio</b>
       <b>--audio-pitch-correction=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              If this is enabled (default), playing with a speed different from normal automatically inserts the
              <b>scaletempo2</b> audio filter. You can insert filters besides <b>scaletempo2</b> and modify their params using
              <u>Conditional</u> <u>auto</u> <u>profiles</u>:

                 [af_insert]
                 profile-cond=speed ~= 1
                 profile-restore=copy
                 af-add=scaletempo2=search-interval=50 # Insert filter and params here.

              Filters set this way replace the <b>scaletempo2</b> default, instead of overlapping with it. If there are
              multiple audio filters inserted that can do pitch correction, then only the last one in the filter
              chain is used.  For details on the specifics of  each  available  filter,  see  the  audio  filter
              section.

       <b>--audio-device=&lt;name&gt;</b>
              Use  the  given  audio  device. This consists of the audio output name, e.g.  <b>alsa</b>, followed by <b>/</b>,
              followed by the audio output specific device name. The default value  for  this  option  is  <b>auto</b>,
              which tries every audio output in preference order with the default device.

              You  can  list  audio  devices  with  <b>--audio-device=help</b>. This outputs the device name in quotes,
              followed by a description. The device name is what you have to pass to the <b>--audio-device</b>  option.
              The list of audio devices can be retrieved by API by using the <b>audio-device-list</b> property.

              While the option normally takes one of the strings as indicated by the methods above, you can also
              force  the device for most AOs by building it manually. For example <b>name/foobar</b> forces the AO <b>name</b>
              to use the device <b>foobar</b>. However, the <b>--ao</b> option will strictly force a  specific  AO.  To  avoid
              confusion, don't use <b>--ao</b> and <b>--audio-device</b> together.

                 Example for ALSA

                        MPlayer  and  mplayer2  required you to replace any ',' with '.' and any ':' with '=' in
                        the ALSA device name. For example, to use the device named <b>dmix:default</b>, you had to do:
                     <b>-ao</b> <b>alsa:device=dmix=default</b>

                 In mpv you could instead use:
                     <b>--audio-device=alsa/dmix:default</b>

       <b>--audio-exclusive=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Enable exclusive output mode. In this mode, the system is usually locked out, and only mpv will be
              able to output audio.

              This only works for some audio outputs, such as <b>wasapi</b>, <b>coreaudio</b>, <b>pipewire</b> and  <b>audiounit</b>.  Other
              audio  outputs silently ignore this option.  They either have no concept of exclusive mode, or the
              mpv side of the implementation is missing.

       <b>--audio-fallback-to-null=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              If no audio device can be opened, behave as if <b>--ao=null</b> was given. This is useful in  combination
              with <b>--audio-device</b>: instead of causing an error if the selected device does not exist, the client
              API  user  (or  a  Lua  script) could let playback continue normally, and check the <b>current-ao</b> and
              <b>audio-device-list</b> properties to make high-level decisions about how to continue.

       <b>--ao=&lt;driver&gt;</b>
              Specify the audio output drivers to be used. See AUDIO OUTPUT DRIVERS for details and descriptions
              of available drivers.

       <b>--af=&lt;filter1[=parameter1:parameter2:...],filter2,...&gt;</b>
              Specify a list of audio filters to apply to the audio stream. See AUDIO FILTERS  for  details  and
              descriptions of the available filters.  The option variants <b>--af-add</b>, <b>--af-pre</b>, and <b>--af-clr</b> exist
              to modify a previously specified list, but you should not need these for typical use.

       <b>--audio-spdif=&lt;codecs&gt;</b>
              List  of codecs for which compressed audio passthrough should be used. This works for both classic
              S/PDIF and HDMI.

              Possible codecs are <b>ac3</b>,  <b>dts</b>,  <b>dts-hd</b>,  <b>eac3</b>,  <b>truehd</b>.   Multiple  codecs  can  be  specified  by
              separating  them  with  <b>,</b>.  <b>dts</b>  refers  to  low  bitrate  DTS core, while <b>dts-hd</b> refers to DTS MA
              (receiver and OS support varies). If both <b>dts</b> and <b>dts-hd</b> are specified, it behaves  equivalent  to
              specifying <b>dts-hd</b> only.

              In  earlier  mpv  versions  you  could  use  <b>--ad</b>  to force the spdif wrapper.  This does not work
              anymore.

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 There is not much reason to use this. HDMI supports  uncompressed  multichannel  PCM,  and  mpv
                 supports lossless DTS-HD decoding via FFmpeg's new DCA decoder (based on libdcadec).

       <b>--ad=&lt;decoder1,decoder2,...[-]&gt;</b>
              Specify  a  priority  list  of  audio  decoders  to be used, according to their decoder name. When
              determining which decoder to use, the first decoder that matches the audio format is selected.  If
              that  is  unavailable, the next decoder is used. Finally, it tries all other decoders that are not
              explicitly selected or rejected by the option.

              <b>-</b> at the end of the list suppresses fallback on other available decoders not  on  the  <b>--ad</b>  list.
              This  should not normally be used, because they break normal decoder auto-selection! The <b>-</b> mode is
              deprecated.

                 Examples

                 <b>--ad=mp3float</b>
                        Prefer the FFmpeg <b>mp3float</b> decoder over all other MP3 decoders.

                 <b>--ad=help</b>
                        List all available decoders.

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 Enabling compressed audio passthrough (AC3 and DTS via SPDIF/HDMI)  with  this  option  is  not
                 possible. Use <b>--audio-spdif</b> instead.

       <b>--volume=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Set  the startup volume. 0 means silence, 100 means no volume reduction or amplification. Negative
              values can be passed for compatibility, but are treated as 0.

              Since mpv 0.18.1, this always controls the internal mixer (aka software volume).

       <b>--volume-max=&lt;100.0-1000.0&gt;</b>
              Set the maximum amplification level in percent (default: 130). A value of 130 will  allow  you  to
              adjust the volume up to about double the normal level.

       <b>--volume-gain=&lt;db&gt;</b>
              Set the volume gain in dB. This is applied on top of other volume and gain settings.

       <b>--volume-gain-max=&lt;0.0-150.0&gt;,</b> <b>--volume-gain-min=&lt;-150.0-0.0&gt;</b>
              Set the volume gain range in dB (default: -96 dB min, 12 dB max).

       <b>--replaygain=&lt;no|track|album&gt;</b>
              Adjust   volume   gain   according  to  replaygain  values  stored  in  the  file  metadata.  With
              <b>--replaygain=no</b> (the default), perform no adjustment.  With <b>--replaygain=track</b>, apply track  gain.
              With <b>--replaygain=album</b>, apply album gain if present and fall back to track gain otherwise.

       <b>--replaygain-preamp=&lt;db&gt;</b>
              Pre-amplification gain in dB to apply to the selected replaygain gain (default: 0).

       <b>--replaygain-clip=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Allow the volume gain to clip (default: no). If this option is not enabled, mpv automatically will
              prevent clipping by lowering the gain.

       <b>--replaygain-fallback=&lt;db&gt;</b>
              Gain  in  dB  to  apply  if the file has no replay gain tags. This option is always applied if the
              replaygain logic is somehow inactive. If this is applied, no other replaygain options are applied.

       <b>--audio-delay=&lt;sec&gt;</b>
              Audio delay in seconds (positive or negative float value). Positive values delay  the  audio,  and
              negative values delay the video.

       <b>--mute=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Set startup audio mute status (default: no).

              See also: <b>--volume</b>.

       <b>--audio-demuxer=&lt;[+]name&gt;</b>
              Use  this  audio demuxer type when using <b>--audio-file</b>. Use a '+' before the name to force it; this
              will skip some checks. Give the demuxer name as printed by <b>--audio-demuxer=help</b>.

       <b>--ad-lavc-ac3drc=&lt;level&gt;</b>
              Select the Dynamic Range Compression level for AC-3 audio  streams.   <b>&lt;level&gt;</b>  is  a  float  value
              ranging  from  0  to  1,  where  0  means  no  compression (which is the default) and 1 means full
              compression (make loud passages more silent and vice versa). Values up to 6 are also accepted, but
              are purely experimental. This option only shows an effect if the AC-3 stream contains the required
              range compression information.

              The standard mandates that DRC is enabled by default, but mpv (and some other players) ignore this
              for the sake of better audio quality.

       <b>--ad-lavc-downmix=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Whether to request audio channel downmixing from the decoder (default: no).  Some  decoders,  like
              AC-3,  AAC  and  DTS,  can remix audio on decoding. The requested number of output channels is set
              with the <b>--audio-channels</b> option.  Useful for playing surround audio on a stereo system.

       <b>--ad-lavc-threads=&lt;0-16&gt;</b>
              Number of threads to use for decoding. Whether threading is actually supported depends  on  codec.
              As  of  this  writing,  it's supported for some lossless codecs only. 0 means autodetect number of
              cores on the machine and use that, up to the maximum of 16 (default: 1).

       <b>--ad-lavc-o=&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;[,&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;[,...]]</b>
              Pass AVOptions to libavcodec decoder. Note, a patch to make the o= unneeded and pass  all  unknown
              options  through  the  AVOption  system  is  welcome. A full list of AVOptions can be found in the
              FFmpeg manual.

              This is a key/value list option. See List Options for details.

       <b>--ad-spdif-dtshd=&lt;yes|no&gt;,</b> <b>--dtshd=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              If DTS is passed through, use DTS-HD.

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 This and enabling passthrough via <b>--ad</b> are deprecated in favor of using <b>--audio-spdif=dts-hd</b>.

       <b>--audio-channels=&lt;auto-safe|auto|layouts&gt;</b>
              Control which audio channels are output (e.g.  surround  vs.  stereo).  There  are  the  following
              possibilities:

              •

                <b>--audio-channels=auto-safe</b>
                       Use  the  system's  preferred  channel layout. If there is none (such as when accessing a
                       hardware device instead of the system mixer), force  stereo.  Some  audio  outputs  might
                       simply accept any layout and do downmixing on their own.

                       This is the default.

              •

                <b>--audio-channels=auto</b>
                       Send  the  audio  device  whatever  it  accepts,  preferring the audio's original channel
                       layout. Can cause issues with HDMI (see the warning below).

              •

                <b>--audio-channels=layout1,layout2,...</b>
                       List of <b>,</b>-separated channel layouts which should  be  allowed.   Technically,  this  only
                       adjusts  the  filter chain output to the best matching layout in the list, and passes the
                       result to the audio API.  It's possible that  the  audio  API  will  select  a  different
                       channel layout.

                       Using this mode is recommended for direct hardware output, especially over HDMI (see HDMI
                       warning below).

              •

                <b>--audio-channels=&lt;stereo|mono&gt;</b>
                       Force  a  downmix  to  stereo or mono. These are special-cases of the previous item. (See
                       paragraphs below for implications.)

              If a list of layouts is given, each item can be either an explicit channel layout name (like <b>5.1</b>),
              or a channel number. Channel numbers refer to default layouts, e.g. 2 channels refer to stereo,  6
              refers to 5.1.

              See <b>--audio-channels=help</b> output for defined default layouts. This also lists speaker names, which
              can be used to express arbitrary channel layouts (e.g. <b>fl-fr-lfe</b> is 2.1).

              If  the list of channel layouts has only 1 item, the decoder is asked to produce according output.
              This sometimes triggers decoder-downmix, which might be different from  the  normal  mpv  downmix.
              (Only   some   decoders   support   remixing   audio,   like   AC-3,  AAC  or  DTS.  You  can  use
              <b>--ad-lavc-downmix=no</b> to make the decoder always output its native layout.) One consequence is that
              <b>--audio-channels=stereo</b> triggers decoder downmix, while <b>auto</b> or <b>auto-safe</b> never will, even if they
              end up selecting stereo. This happens because the decision whether to use decoder downmix  happens
              long before the audio device is opened.

              If  the  channel  layout  of  the  media file (i.e. the decoder) and the AO's channel layout don't
              match, mpv will attempt to insert a conversion filter.  You may need to change the channel  layout
              of  the  system mixer to achieve your desired output as mpv does not have control over it. Another
              work-around for this on some AOs is to use <b>--audio-exclusive=yes</b> to circumvent  the  system  mixer
              entirely.

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 Using  <b>auto</b>  can  cause  issues  when  using  audio over HDMI. The OS will typically report all
                 channel layouts that _can_ go over HDMI, even if the receiver  does  not  support  them.  If  a
                 receiver  gets  an  unsupported  channel layout, random things can happen, such as dropping the
                 additional channels, or adding noise.

                 You are recommended to set an explicit whitelist of the layouts you want. For example, most A/V
                 receivers   connected   via   HDMI   and   that   can   do   7.1   would    be    served    by:
                 <b>--audio-channels=7.1,5.1,stereo</b>

       <b>--audio-display=&lt;no|embedded-first|external-first&gt;</b>
              Determines  whether  to display cover art when playing audio files and with what priority. It will
              display the first image found, and additional images are available as video tracks.

              <b>no</b>     Disable display of video entirely when playing audio files.

              <b>embedded-first</b>
                     Display embedded images  and  external  cover  art,  giving  priority  to  embedded  images
                     (default).

              <b>external-first</b>
                     Display embedded images and external cover art, giving priority to external files.

              This option has no influence on files with normal video tracks.

       <b>--audio-files=&lt;files&gt;</b>
              Play audio from an external file while viewing a video.

              This is a path list option. See List Options for details.

       <b>--audio-file=&lt;file&gt;</b>
              CLI/config  file only alias for <b>--audio-files-append</b>. Each use of this option will add a new audio
              track. The details are similar to how <b>--sub-file</b> works.

       <b>--audio-format=&lt;format&gt;</b>
              Select the sample format used for output from the audio filter layer to the sound card. The values
              that <b>&lt;format&gt;</b> can adopt are listed below in the description of the <b>format</b> audio filter.

       <b>--audio-samplerate=&lt;Hz&gt;</b>
              Select the output sample rate to be used (of course sound cards  have  limits  on  this).  If  the
              sample  frequency  selected  is  different from that of the current media, the internal swresample
              audio filter will be inserted into the audio filter layer to compensate for the difference.

       <b>--gapless-audio=&lt;no|yes|weak&gt;</b>
              Try to play consecutive audio files with no silence or disruption at the  point  of  file  change.
              Default: <b>weak</b>.

              <b>no</b>     Disable gapless audio.

              <b>yes</b>    The  audio  device  is opened using parameters chosen for the first file played and is then
                     kept open for gapless playback. This means that if the first file for  example  has  a  low
                     sample  rate,  then  the  following  files  may  get resampled to the same low sample rate,
                     resulting in reduced sound quality. If you play files with different  parameters,  consider
                     using  options  such as <b>--audio-samplerate</b> and <b>--audio-format</b> to explicitly select what the
                     shared output format will be.

              <b>weak</b>   Normally, the audio device is kept open (using the format it was first  initialized  with).
                     If  the  audio  format the decoder output changes, the audio device is closed and reopened.
                     This means that you will normally get gapless audio with files that were encoded using  the
                     same  settings,  but might not be gapless in other cases.  The exact conditions under which
                     the audio device is kept open is an implementation detail, and can change from  version  to
                     version.   Currently,  the device is kept even if the sample format changes, but the sample
                     formats are convertible.  If video is still going on when there is still audio,  trying  to
                     use gapless is also explicitly given up.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This  feature  is implemented in a simple manner and relies on audio output device buffering to
                 continue playback while moving from one file to another. If playback of  the  new  file  starts
                 slowly,  for  example  because  it is played from a remote network location or because you have
                 specified cache settings that require time for the initial cache fill, then the buffered  audio
                 may run out before playback of the new file can start.

       <b>--initial-audio-sync=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              When  starting  a video file or after events such as seeking, mpv will by default modify the audio
              stream to make it start from the same timestamp as video, by either inserting silence at the start
              or cutting away the first samples. Disabling this option makes the player behave  like  older  mpv
              versions  did: video and audio are both started immediately even if their start timestamps differ,
              and then video timing is gradually adjusted if necessary to reach correct synchronization later.

       <b>--audio-file-auto=&lt;no|exact|fuzzy|all&gt;</b>
              Load additional audio files matching the video filename.  The  parameter  specifies  how  external
              audio files are matched.

              <b>no</b>     Don't automatically load external audio files (default).

              <b>exact</b>  Load the media filename with audio file extension.

              <b>fuzzy</b>  Load all audio files containing the media filename.

              <b>all</b>    Load all audio files in the current and <b>--audio-file-paths</b> directories.

       <b>--audio-exts=ext1,ext2,...</b>
              Audio  file  extensions  to  try  to  match when using <b>--audio-file-auto</b>, <b>--autocreate-playlist</b> or
              <b>--directory-filter-types</b>.

              This is a string list option. See List Options for details.  Use <b>--help=audio-exts</b> to see  default
              extensions.

       <b>--audio-file-paths=&lt;path1:path2:...&gt;</b>
              Equivalent to <b>--sub-file-paths</b> option, but for auto-loaded audio files.

              This is a path list option. See List Options for details.

       <b>--audio-client-name=&lt;name&gt;</b>
              The  application  name  the  player reports to the audio API. Can be useful if you want to force a
              different audio profile (e.g. with PulseAudio), or to set your own  application  name  when  using
              libmpv.

       <b>--audio-buffer=&lt;seconds&gt;</b>
              Set  the audio output minimum buffer. The audio device might actually create a larger buffer if it
              pleases. If the device creates a smaller buffer, additional audio is  buffered  in  an  additional
              software buffer.

              Making  this  larger  may  make  soft-volume  and other filters react slower, introduce additional
              issues on playback speed change, and block the player on audio format changes.  A  smaller  buffer
              might lead to audio dropouts.

              This  option  should be used for testing only. If a non-default value helps significantly, the mpv
              developers should be contacted.

              Default: 0.2 (200 ms).

       <b>--audio-stream-silence=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Cash-grab consumer audio hardware (such as A/V receivers) often ignore  initial  audio  sent  over
              HDMI.  This  can  happen every time audio over HDMI is stopped and resumed. In order to compensate
              for this, you can enable this option to not to stop and restart audio on seeks, and fill the  gaps
              with  silence.  Likewise, when pausing playback, audio is not stopped, and silence is played while
              paused. Note that if  no  audio  track  is  selected,  the  audio  device  will  still  be  closed
              immediately.

              Not all AOs support this.

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 This  modifies  certain  subtle  player behavior, like A/V-sync and underrun handling. Enabling
                 this option is strongly discouraged.

       <b>--audio-wait-open=&lt;secs&gt;</b>
              This makes sense for use with <b>--audio-stream-silence=yes</b>. If this option is given, the player will
              wait for the given amount of seconds after opening the audio device before  sending  actual  audio
              data to it. Useful if your expensive hardware discards the first 1 or 2 seconds of audio data sent
              to it. If <b>--audio-stream-silence=yes</b> is not set, this option will likely just waste time.

   <b>Subtitles</b>
       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Changing  styling  and  position  does  not  work  with  all  subtitles.  Image-based  subtitles (DVD,
          Bluray/PGS, DVB) cannot changed for fundamental reasons.  Subtitles in ASS  format  are  normally  not
          changed intentionally, but overriding them can be controlled with <b>--sub-ass-override</b>.

       <b>--sub-demuxer=&lt;[+]name&gt;</b>
              Force   subtitle   demuxer   type   for   <b>--sub-file</b>.   Give   the  demuxer  name  as  printed  by
              <b>--sub-demuxer=help</b>.

       <b>--sub-lavc-o=&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;[,&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;[,...]]</b>
              Pass AVOptions to libavcodec decoder. Note, a patch to make the o= unneeded and pass  all  unknown
              options  through  the  AVOption  system  is  welcome. A full list of AVOptions can be found in the
              FFmpeg manual.

              This is a key/value list option. See List Options for details.

       <b>--sub-delay=&lt;sec&gt;</b>
              Delays primary subtitles by <b>&lt;sec&gt;</b> seconds. Can be negative.

       <b>--secondary-sub-delay=&lt;sec&gt;</b>
              Delays secondary subtitles by <b>&lt;sec&gt;</b> seconds. Can be negative.

       <b>--sub-files=&lt;file-list&gt;,</b> <b>--sub-file=&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Add a subtitle file to the list of external subtitles.

              If you use <b>--sub-file</b> only once, this subtitle file is displayed by default.

              If <b>--sub-file</b> is used multiple times, the subtitle to use can be switched at  runtime  by  cycling
              subtitle  tracks.  It's  possible  to  show  two  subtitles at once: use <b>--sid</b> to select the first
              subtitle index, and <b>--secondary-sid</b> to select the second index.  (The  index  is  printed  on  the
              terminal output after the <b>--sid=</b> in the list of streams.)

              <b>--sub-files</b>  is  a  path  list  option (see List Options  for details), and can take multiple file
              names separated by <b>:</b> (Unix) or <b>;</b> (Windows), while  <b>--sub-file</b> takes a single filename, but can  be
              used multiple times to add multiple files. Technically, <b>--sub-file</b> is a CLI/config file only alias
              for  <b>--sub-files-append</b>.

       <b>--secondary-sid=&lt;ID|auto|no&gt;</b>
              Select a secondary subtitle stream. This is similar to <b>--sid</b>. If a secondary subtitle is selected,
              it  will  be rendered as toptitle (i.e. on the top of the screen) alongside the normal subtitle by
              default, and provides a way to render two subtitles at once.

              There are some caveats associated with this feature. For example, bitmap subtitles will always  be
              rendered in their usual position, so selecting a bitmap subtitle as secondary subtitle will result
              in  overlapping  subtitles.   Secondary  subtitles  are  never  shown  on the terminal if video is
              disabled.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Styling and interpretation of any formatting tags  is  disabled  for  the  secondary  subtitle.
                 Internally, the same mechanism as <b>--sub-ass=no</b> is used to strip the styling.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 If  the  main subtitle stream contains formatting tags which display the subtitle at the top of
                 the screen, it will overlap with the  secondary  subtitle.  To  prevent  this,  you  could  use
                 <b>--sub-ass=no</b> to disable styling in the main subtitle stream.

       <b>--sub-scale=&lt;0-100&gt;</b>
              Factor for the text subtitle font size (default: 1).

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This  affects  ASS  subtitles  as  well, and may lead to incorrect subtitle rendering. Use with
                 care, or use <b>--sub-font-size</b> instead.

       <b>--sub-scale-signs=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              When set to yes, also apply <b>--sub-scale</b> to typesetting (or "signs").  When  this  is  set  to  no,
              <b>--sub-scale</b>  is only applied to dialogue. The distinction between dialogue and typesetting is done
              on a best effort basis and is not infallible (default: no).

       <b>--sub-scale-by-window=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Whether to scale subtitles with the  window  size  (default:  yes).  If  this  is  disabled  while
              <b>--sub-scale-with-window</b>  is  set  to  yes, changing the window size won't change the subtitle font
              size.

              Affects plain text subtitles only (or ASS if <b>--sub-ass-override</b> is set high enough).

       <b>--sub-scale-with-window=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Make the subtitle font size relative to the window (default:  yes).  If  this  is  disabled  while
              <b>--sub-scale-by-window</b>  is  set to yes, the subtitle font size is scaled relative to the video size
              instead.

              Affects plain text subtitles only (or ASS if <b>--sub-ass-override</b> is set high enough).

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 By default, the subtitle font size is scaled with the window  size.   To  make  the  font  size
                 constant,  set  only  <b>--sub-scale-by-window</b> to no.  To make the font size scale with video size
                 instead, set only <b>--sub-scale-with-window</b> to no.  It's not meaningful to set  both  options  to
                 no.

       <b>--sub-ass-scale-with-window=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Like  <b>--sub-scale-with-window</b>,  but  affects subtitles in ASS format only.  Like <b>--sub-scale</b>, this
              can break ASS subtitles.

              Default: no.

       <b>--embeddedfonts=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Use fonts embedded in Matroska container files and ASS scripts (default: yes). These fonts can  be
              used for SSA/ASS subtitle rendering.

       <b>--sub-pos=&lt;0-150&gt;</b>
              Specify  the  position  of  subtitles  on  the  screen.  The value is the vertical position of the
              subtitle in % of the screen height. 100 is the original position, which is often not the  absolute
              bottom  of  the screen, but with some margin between the bottom and the subtitle. Values above 100
              move the subtitle further down.

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 Text subtitles (as opposed to image subtitles) may be cut off if the value  of  the  option  is
                 above 100. This is a libass restriction.

                 This affects ASS subtitles as well, and may lead to incorrect subtitle rendering in addition to
                 the problem above.

                 Using <b>--sub-margin-y</b> can achieve this in a better way.

       <b>--secondary-sub-pos=&lt;0-150&gt;</b>
              Specify  the  position  of secondary subtitles on the screen. This is similar to <b>--sub-pos</b> but for
              secondary subtitles.

       <b>--sub-speed=&lt;0.1-10.0&gt;</b>
              Multiply the subtitle event timestamps with the given value. Can be used to fix the playback speed
              for frame-based subtitle formats. Affects text subtitles only.

                 Example

                        <b>--sub-speed=25/23.976</b> plays frame based subtitles which  have  been  loaded  assuming  a
                        framerate of 23.976 at 25 FPS.

       <b>--sub-ass-style-overrides=&lt;[Style.]Param=Value[,...]&gt;</b>
              Override some style or script info parameters.

              This is a string list option. See List Options for details.

                 Examples

                 • <b>--sub-ass-style-overrides=FontName=Arial,Default.Bold=1</b>

                 • <b>--sub-ass-style-overrides=PlayResY=768</b>

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Using this option may lead to incorrect subtitle rendering.

       <b>--sub-hinting=&lt;none|light|normal|native&gt;</b>
              Set font hinting type. &lt;type&gt; can be:

              <b>none</b>   no hinting (default)

              <b>light</b>  FreeType autohinter, light mode

              <b>normal</b> FreeType autohinter, normal mode

              <b>native</b> font native hinter

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 Enabling  hinting can lead to mispositioned text (in situations it's supposed to match up video
                 background), or reduce the smoothness of animations with some badly authored ASS scripts. It is
                 recommended to not use this option, unless really needed.

       <b>--sub-line-spacing=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Set line spacing value for SSA/ASS renderer.

       <b>--sub-shaper=&lt;simple|complex&gt;</b>
              Set the text layout engine used by libass.

              <b>simple</b> uses Fribidi only, fast, doesn't render some languages correctly

              <b>complex</b>
                     uses HarfBuzz, slower, wider language support

              <b>complex</b> is the default. If libass hasn't been compiled against HarfBuzz, libass  silently  reverts
              to <b>simple</b>.

       <b>--sub-ass-prune-delay=&lt;-1|seconds&gt;</b>
              Set the delay for automatic pruning of events from memory in libass. When enabled, subtitle events
              are removed from memory once their end timestamp is older than the specified delay.

              <b>-1</b>     disables automatic pruning (default).

              <b>seconds</b>
                     specify  how many seconds after an event is no longer displayed should the pruning occur. <b>0</b>
                     prunes events as soon as they're off screen.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This breaks sub-seek and subtitle  rendering  when  changing  play-direction  from  forward  to
                 backward  during  runtime for events that were already "seen" and need to be rendered again, if
                 those events got pruned.

       <b>--sub-ass-styles=&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Load all SSA/ASS styles found in the specified file and use them for rendering text subtitles. The
              syntax of the file is exactly like the <b>[V4</b> <b>Styles]</b> / <b>[V4+</b> <b>Styles]</b> section of SSA/ASS.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Using this option may lead to incorrect subtitle rendering.

       <b>--sub-ass-override=&lt;no|yes|scale|force|strip&gt;</b>
              Control whether user style overrides should be applied. Note that all of these overrides try to be
              somewhat smart about figuring out whether or not a subtitle is considered a "sign" and try  to  be
              as non-destructive as possible.

              <b>no</b>     Render subtitles as specified by the subtitle scripts, without overrides.

              <b>yes</b>    Apply  all  the  <b>--sub-ass-*</b>  style override options. Changing the default for any of these
                     options can lead to incorrect subtitle rendering.

              <b>scale</b>  Like <b>yes</b>, but also apply <b>--sub-scale</b> (default).

              <b>force</b>  Like <b>yes</b>, but also force all <b>--sub-*</b> options. Can break rendering easily.  Certain  options
                     aren't overridden if they can potentially be too destructive.

              <b>strip</b>  Radically  strip  all  ASS tags and styles from the subtitle. This is equivalent to the old
                     <b>--no-ass</b> / <b>--no-sub-ass</b> options.

              This also controls some bitmap subtitle overrides, as well as  HTML  tags  in  formats  like  SRT,
              despite the name of the option.

       <b>--secondary-sub-ass-override=&lt;no|yes|scale|force|strip&gt;</b>
              Control  whether  user  secondary  substyle  overrides  should be applied. This works exactly like
              <b>--sub-ass-override</b>.

              Default: strip.

       <b>--sub-ass-force-margins</b>
              Enables placing toptitles and subtitles in black borders when they are available, if the subtitles
              are in the ASS format.

              Default: no.

       <b>--sub-use-margins</b>
              Enables placing toptitles and subtitles in black borders when they are available, if the subtitles
              are in a plain text format  (or ASS if <b>--sub-ass-override</b> is set high enough).

              Default: yes.

       <b>--sub-ass-use-video-data=&lt;none|aspect-ratio|all&gt;</b>
              Controls which information about the video stream is passed to libass.   Any  option  but  <b>all</b>  is
              incompatible  with  standard  ASS as defined by VSFilter, whose behavior most subtitle scripts and
              renderers target, including libass.  Video stream properties  are  needed  to  accurately  emulate
              VSFilter  semantics  and withholding them will likely result in broken subtitle rendering for most
              files.  It's thus recommended to only change this selectively if required on a per-file basis.

              <b>none</b>   Don't forward any video stream information.

              <b>aspect-ratio</b>
                     Only forward aspect ratio; fallbacks are used for other properties.   This  makes  behavior
                     consistent across different video resolutions.

              <b>all</b>    Forward all available information, notably including storage resolution.

              For  certain  kinds  of  broken  ASS  files  which got repurposed across several video resolutions
              without either setting <b>LayoutRes</b> headers or adjusting affected effects, it  may  be  desirable  to
              withhold  storage  resolution  information  from  libass  to  ensure  consistent  rendering across
              resolutions.  Among others this affects 3D rotations and blurs.  When encountering such files, try
              setting <b>aspect-ratio</b>.

              Even more broken files on anamorphic video might  also  exhibit  stretching  unless  aspect  ratio
              information  is  also  faked,  in  this  case  you can try using <b>none</b>. This has never an effect on
              non-anamorphic video.

              Default: <b>all</b>

       <b>--sub-ass-video-aspect-override=&lt;no|ratio&gt;</b>
              Allows passing any arbitrary aspect ratio to libass instead of the video’s  actual  aspect  ratio.
              Zero aspect ratio is identical to <b>no</b>.

              This has no effect if <b>sub-ass-use-video-data</b> is set to <b>none</b>.

       <b>--sub-vsfilter-bidi-compat=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Set  implicit  bidi  detection  to  <b>ltr</b>  instead of <b>auto</b> to match ASS' default. This also disables
              libass' incompatible extensions. This currently includes bracket pair matching  according  to  the
              revised  Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm introduced in Unicode 6.3, and also affects how BiDi runs
              are split and processed, as well as soft linewrapping of Unicode text.

              This affects plaintext (non-ASS) subtitles only. Default: no.

       <b>--sub-ass-vsfilter-color-compat=&lt;basic|full|force-601|no&gt;</b>
              Mangle colors like (xy-)vsfilter do (default: basic). Historically, VSFilter was not  color  space
              aware.  This  was  no  problem as long as the color space used for SD video (BT.601) was used. But
              when everything switched to HD (BT.709), VSFilter was  still  converting  RGB  colors  to  BT.601,
              rendered  them  into  the  video frame, and handled the frame to the video output, which would use
              BT.709 for conversion to RGB. The result were mangled subtitle colors. Later on,  bad  hacks  were
              added on top of the ASS format to control how colors are to be mangled.

              <b>basic</b>  Handle  only  BT.601-&gt;BT.709  mangling,  if  the  subtitles  seem  to indicate that this is
                     required (default).

              <b>full</b>   Handle the full <b>YCbCr</b> <b>Matrix</b> header with all video color spaces  supported  by  libass  and
                     mpv.  This  might  lead  to  bad  breakages  in corner cases and is not strictly needed for
                     compatibility (hopefully), which is why this is not default.

              <b>force-601</b>
                     Force BT.601-&gt;BT.709 mangling, regardless of subtitle headers or video color space.

              <b>no</b>     Disable color mangling completely. All colors are RGB.

              Choosing anything other than <b>no</b> will make the subtitle color depend on the video color space,  and
              it's  for  example  in theory not possible to reuse a subtitle script with another video file. The
              <b>--sub-ass-override</b> option doesn't affect how this option is interpreted.

       <b>--stretch-dvd-subs=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Stretch DVD subtitles when playing anamorphic videos for better looking fonts  on  badly  mastered
              DVDs.  This switch has no effect when the video is stored with square pixels - which for DVD input
              cannot be the case though.

              Many studios tend to use bitmap fonts designed for square pixels when authoring DVDs, causing  the
              fonts  to  look stretched on playback on DVD players. This option fixes them, however at the price
              of possibly misaligning some subtitles (e.g. sign translations).

              Disabled by default.

       <b>--stretch-image-subs-to-screen=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Stretch DVD and other image subtitles to the screen,  ignoring  the  video  margins.  This  has  a
              similar  effect  as  <b>--sub-use-margins</b>  for  text  subtitles,  except that the text itself will be
              stretched, not only just repositioned. (At least in general it is unavoidable, as an image  bitmap
              can  in  theory  consist  of  a single bitmap covering the whole screen, and the player won't know
              where exactly the text parts are located.)

              This option does not display subtitles correctly. Use with care.

              Disabled by default.

       <b>--image-subs-video-resolution=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Override the image subtitle resolution with the video  resolution  (default:  no).  Normally,  the
              subtitle  canvas  is  fit  into  the video canvas (e.g. letterboxed). Setting this option uses the
              video size as subtitle canvas size. Can be useful to test broken  subtitles,  which  often  happen
              when the video was transcoded, while attempting to keep the old subtitles.

       <b>--sub-ass=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Render ASS subtitles natively (default: yes).

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This  has  been deprecated by <b>--sub-ass-override=strip</b>. You also may need <b>--embeddedfonts=no</b> to
                 get the same behavior. Also, using <b>--sub-ass-override=style</b> should give better results  without
                 breaking subtitles too much.

              If <b>--sub-ass=no</b> is specified, all tags and style declarations are stripped and ignored on display.
              The subtitle renderer uses the font style as specified by the <b>--sub-</b> options instead.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Using  <b>--sub-ass=no</b>  may lead to incorrect or completely broken rendering of ASS/SSA subtitles.
                 It can sometimes be useful to forcibly override the styling of ASS  subtitles,  but  should  be
                 avoided in general.

       <b>--sub-auto=&lt;no|exact|fuzzy|all&gt;</b>
              Load  additional  subtitle files matching the video filename. The parameter specifies how external
              subtitle files are matched. <b>exact</b> is enabled by default.

              <b>no</b>     Don't automatically load external subtitle files.

              <b>exact</b>  Load the media filename  with  subtitle  file  extension  and  possibly  language  suffixes
                     (default).

              <b>fuzzy</b>  Load all subs containing the media filename.

              <b>all</b>    Load all subs in the current and <b>--sub-file-paths</b> directories.

       <b>--sub-auto-exts=ext1,ext2,...</b>
              Subtitle  extensions  to  try  and match when using <b>--sub-auto</b>. Note that modifying this list will
              also affect what mpv recognizes as subtitles when using drag and drop.

              This is a string list option. See List Options for details.

       <b>--sub-codepage=&lt;codepage&gt;</b>
              You can use this option to specify the subtitle codepage. uchardet  will  be  used  to  guess  the
              charset. (If mpv was not compiled with uchardet, then <b>utf-8</b> is the effective default.)

              The default value for this option is <b>auto</b>, which enables autodetection.

              The following steps are taken to determine the final codepage, in order:

              • if the specific codepage has a <b>+</b>, use that codepage

              • if the data looks like UTF-8, assume it is UTF-8

              • if <b>--sub-codepage</b> is set to a specific codepage, use that

              • run uchardet, and if successful, use that

              • otherwise, use <b>UTF-8-BROKEN</b>

                 Examples

                 • <b>--sub-codepage=latin2</b> Use Latin 2 if input is not UTF-8.

                 • <b>--sub-codepage=+cp1250</b> Always force recoding to cp1250.

              The  pseudo  codepage  <b>UTF-8-BROKEN</b>  is used internally. If it's set, subtitles are interpreted as
              UTF-8 with "Latin 1" as fallback for bytes which are not valid UTF-8  sequences.  iconv  is  never
              involved in this mode.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This  works  for text subtitle files only. Other types of subtitles (in particular subtitles in
                 mkv files) are always assumed to be UTF-8.

       <b>--sub-stretch-durations=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Stretch a subtitle duration so it ends when the next one starts.  Should help with subtitles which
              erroneously have zero durations.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Only applies to text subtitles.

       <b>--sub-fix-timing=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Adjust subtitle timing is to remove minor gaps or overlaps between subtitles (if the difference is
              smaller than 210 ms, the gap or overlap is removed).

       <b>--sub-forced-events-only=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Enabling this displays only forced events within  subtitle  streams.  Only  some  bitmap  subtitle
              formats  (such as DVD or PGS) are capable of having a mixture of forced and unforced events within
              the stream. Enabling this on text subtitles will cause no subtitles to be displayed (default: <b>no</b>).

       <b>--sub-fps=&lt;rate&gt;</b>
              Specify the framerate of the subtitle file (default: video fps). Affects text subtitles only.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 <b>&lt;rate&gt;</b> &gt; video fps speeds the subtitles up for frame-based subtitle files and slows  them  down
                 for time-based ones.

              See also: <b>--sub-speed</b>.

       <b>--sub-gauss=&lt;0.0-3.0&gt;</b>
              Apply  Gaussian  blur to image subtitles (default: 0). This can help to make pixelated DVD/Vobsubs
              look nicer. A value other than 0 also switches to software subtitle scaling. Might be slow.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Never applied to text subtitles.

       <b>--sub-gray</b>
              Convert image subtitles to grayscale. Can help to make yellow DVD/Vobsubs look nicer.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Never applied to text subtitles.

       <b>--sub-file-paths=&lt;path-list&gt;</b>
              Specify extra directories to search for subtitles matching the video.  Multiple directories can be
              separated by ":" (";" on Windows).   Paths  can  be  relative  or  absolute.  Relative  paths  are
              interpreted  relative  to video file directory.  If the file is a URL, only absolute paths and <b>sub</b>
              configuration subdirectory will be scanned.

                 Example

                        Assuming that <b>/path/to/video/video.avi</b> is played and  <b>--sub-file-paths=sub:subtitles</b>  is
                        specified, mpv searches for subtitle files in these directories:

                 • <b>/path/to/video/</b>

                 • <b>/path/to/video/sub/</b>

                 • <b>/path/to/video/subtitles/</b>

                 • the <b>sub</b> configuration subdirectory (usually <b><a href="file:~/.config/mpv/sub/">~/.config/mpv/sub/</a></b>)

              This is a path list option. See List Options for details.

       <b>--sub-visibility=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Can be used to disable display of subtitles, but still select and decode them.

       <b>--secondary-sub-visibility=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Can be used to disable display of secondary subtitles, but still select and decode them.

       <b>--sub-clear-on-seek</b>
              (Obscure,  rarely  useful.)  Can be used to play broken mkv files with duplicate ReadOrder fields.
              ReadOrder is the first field in a Matroska-style ASS subtitle packets. It should  be  unique,  and
              libass  uses  it  for  fast  elimination  of duplicates. This option disables caching of subtitles
              across seeks, so after a seek libass can't eliminate subtitle packets with the same  ReadOrder  as
              earlier  packets. Note that enabling this option can result in broken subtitle behavior if you are
              not actually playing one of the aforementioned broken mkv files.

       <b>--teletext-page=&lt;-1-999&gt;</b>
              Select a teletext page number to decode.

              This works for <b>dvb_teletext</b> subtitle streams, and if FFmpeg has been compiled with support for it.

              Values <b>1-999</b> are for individual pages. Special value  <b>0</b>  (default)  matches  all  subtitle  pages.
              Special value <b>-1</b> matches all pages.

              Note  that  page  <b>100</b>  is the default start page of actual teletext. It is also the former default
              value of this option.

              See the <b>libzvbi-teletext</b> section in FFmpeg documentation for details.

              Default: 0

       <b>--sub-past-video-end</b>
              After the last frame of video, if this option is enabled, subtitles will continue to update  based
              on audio timestamps. Otherwise, the subtitles for the last video frame will stay onscreen.

              Default: disabled

       <b>--sub-font=&lt;name&gt;</b>
              Specify font to use for subtitles that do not themselves specify a particular font. The default is
              <b>sans-serif</b>.

                 Examples

                 • <b>--sub-font='Bitstream</b> <b>Vera</b> <b>Sans'</b>

                 • <b>--sub-font='Comic</b> <b>Sans</b> <b>MS'</b>

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 The  <b>--sub-font</b>  option  (and  many  other  style  related  <b>--sub-</b>  options)  are  ignored when
                 ASS-subtitles are rendered, unless <b>--sub-ass=no</b> is specified.

                 This used to support fontconfig patterns. Starting with libass 0.13.0, this stopped working.

       <b>--sub-font-size=&lt;size&gt;</b>
              Specify the sub font size. The unit is the size in scaled pixels at a window height  of  720.  The
              actual pixel size is scaled with the window height: if the window height is larger or smaller than
              720, the actual size of the text increases or decreases as well.

              Default: 38

       <b>--sub-blur=&lt;0..20.0&gt;</b>
              Gaussian blur factor applied to the sub font border.  0 means no blur applied (default).

       <b>--sub-bold=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Format text on bold.

       <b>--sub-italic=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Format text on italic.

       <b>--sub-outline-color=&lt;color&gt;</b>
              See <b>--sub-color</b>. Color used for the sub font outline.

              <b>--sub-border-color</b> is an alias for <b>--sub-outline-color</b>.

       <b>--sub-back-color=&lt;color&gt;</b>
              See <b>--sub-color</b>. Color used for sub text background.

              <b>--sub-shadow-color</b> is an alias for <b>--sub-back-color</b>.

       <b>--sub-outline-size=&lt;size&gt;</b>
              Size  of  the  sub  font  outline in scaled pixels (see <b>--sub-font-size</b> for details). A value of 0
              disables outlines.

              <b>--sub-border-size</b> is an alias for <b>--sub-outline-size</b>.

              Default: 1.65

       <b>--sub-border-style=&lt;outline-and-shadow|opaque-box|background-box&gt;</b>
              The style of the border.

              • <b>outline-and-shadow</b>: draw outline  and  shadow.   The  size  of  the  outline  is  determined  by
                <b>--sub-outline-size</b>,  and  the  offset  of  the shadow is determined by <b>--sub-shadow-offset</b>.  The
                outline is colored by <b>--sub-outline-color</b>, and the shadow is colored by <b>--sub-back-color</b>.   This
                corresponds to <b>BorderStyle=1</b> in the ASS spec.

              • <b>opaque-box</b>:  draw  outline and shadow as opaque boxes that tightly wrap each lines of text.  The
                margin of the outline opaque box is determined by <b>--sub-outline-size</b>,  and  the  offset  of  the
                shadow  opaque  box  is determined by <b>--sub-shadow-offset</b>.  The outline opaque box is colored by
                <b>--sub-outline-color</b>, and the shadow opaque box is  colored  by  <b>--sub-back-color</b>.   Despite  its
                name,  the  opaque  box  can  be semi-transparent.  This corresponds to <b>BorderStyle=3</b> in the ASS
                spec.

              • <b>background-box</b>: draw a background box that bounds all lines of  text.   The  background  box  is
                colored   by   <b>--sub-back-color</b>,  and  the  margin  of  the  background  box  is  determined  by
                <b>--sub-shadow-offset</b>.  The behavior of the outline is the same as the  <b>outline-and-shadow</b>  style.
                This corresponds to <b>BorderStyle=4</b>, which is a libass-specific extension.

              Default: <b>outline-and-shadow</b>.

              Predefined profiles are available to enable optimized <b>background-box</b> style for OSD and subtitles.

                 Profiles

                 • <b>--profile=sub-box</b> applies the <b>background-box</b> style to subtitles

                 • <b>--profile=osd-box</b> applies the <b>background-box</b> style to the OSD, including stats and console

                 • <b>--profile=box</b> applies the <b>background-box</b> style to both subtitles and OSD

       <b>--sub-color=&lt;color&gt;</b>
              Specify the color used for unstyled text subtitles.

              The color is specified in the form <b>r/g/b</b>, where each color component is specified as number in the
              range 0.0 to 1.0. It's also possible to specify the transparency by using <b>r/g/b/a</b>, where the alpha
              value  0  means  fully transparent, and 1.0 means opaque. If the alpha component is not given, the
              color is 100% opaque.

              Passing a single number to the option sets the sub to gray, and the form <b>gray/a</b> lets  you  specify
              alpha additionally.

                 Examples

                 • <b>--sub-color=1.0/0.0/0.0</b> set sub to opaque red

                 • <b>--sub-color=1.0/0.0/0.0/0.75</b> set sub to opaque red with 75% alpha

                 • <b>--sub-color=0.5/0.75</b> set sub to 50% gray with 75% alpha

              Alternatively,  the  color  can  be specified as a RGB hex triplet in the form <b>#RRGGBB</b>, where each
              2-digit group expresses a color value in the range 0 (<b>00</b>) to 255 (<b>FF</b>).  For  example,  <b>#FF0000</b>  is
              red.  Alpha is given with <b>#AARRGGBB</b>.

                 Examples

                 • <b>--sub-color='#FF0000'</b> set sub to opaque red

                 • <b>--sub-color='#C0808080'</b> set sub to 50% gray with 75% alpha

       <b>--sub-margin-x=&lt;size&gt;</b>
              Left and right screen margin for the subs in scaled pixels (see <b>--sub-font-size</b> for details).

              This  option  specifies the distance of the sub to the left, as well as at which distance from the
              right border long sub text will be broken.

              Default: 19

       <b>--sub-margin-y=&lt;size&gt;</b>
              Top and bottom screen margin for the subs in scaled pixels (see <b>--sub-font-size</b> for details).

              This option specifies the vertical margins of unstyled text subtitles.  If you just want to  raise
              the vertical subtitle position, use <b>--sub-pos</b>.

              Default: 34

       <b>--sub-align-x=&lt;left|center|right&gt;</b>
              Control to which corner of the screen text subtitles should be aligned to (default: <b>center</b>).

              Never  applied  to  ASS  subtitles,  except in <b>--sub-ass=no</b> mode. Likewise, this does not apply to
              image subtitles.

       <b>--sub-align-y=&lt;top|center|bottom&gt;</b>
              Vertical position (default: <b>bottom</b>).  Details see <b>--sub-align-x</b>.

       <b>--sub-justify=&lt;auto|left|center|right&gt;</b>
              Control how multi line subs are justified irrespective of where they are  aligned  (default:  <b>auto</b>
              which  justifies as defined by <b>--sub-align-x</b>).  Left justification is recommended to make the subs
              easier to read as it is easier for the eyes.

       <b>--sub-ass-justify=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Applies justification as defined by <b>--sub-justify</b> on ASS subtitles if  <b>--sub-ass-override</b>  is  not
              set to <b>no</b>.  Default: <b>no</b>.

       <b>--sub-shadow-offset=&lt;size&gt;</b>
              Displacement of the sub text shadow in scaled pixels (see <b>--sub-font-size</b> for details). A value of
              0 disables shadows.

              Default: 0.

       <b>--sub-spacing=&lt;size&gt;</b>
              Horizontal  sub  font  spacing  in  scaled pixels (see <b>--sub-font-size</b> for details). This value is
              added to the normal letter spacing. Negative values are allowed.

              Default: 0.

       <b>--sub-filter-sdh=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Applies filter removing subtitle additions  for  the  deaf  or  hard-of-hearing  (SDH).   This  is
              intended  for English, but may in part work for other languages too.  The intention is that it can
              be always enabled so may not remove all parts added.

              It removes speaker labels (like MAN:) and any text enclosed within  symbols  like  parentheses  or
              brackets  as  specified  by  the  <b>--sub-filter-sdh-enclosures</b> option.  Note that parenthesis (full
              width parenthesis and the normal variant) are a special case and only upper case text is  removed.
              For more filtering, you can use the <b>--sub-filter-sdh-harder</b> option.

              Default: <b>no</b>.

       <b>--sub-filter-sdh-harder=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Do  harder  SDH  filtering  (if enabled by <b>--sub-filter-sdh</b>).  Will also remove speaker labels and
              text within parentheses using both lower and upper case letters.

              Default: <b>no</b>.

       <b>--sub-filter-sdh-enclosures=&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Specify a string of characters that <b>--sub-filter-sdh</b> will use to  potentially  remove  text.  Text
              that  is  enclosed  within  characters specified by this string will be removed. Note that bracket
              characters with known pairs (such as <b>(</b> or <b>[</b>) will be mapped internally  to  their  matching  right
              hand character, so you only need to specify left hand characters.

              Default: <b>([（</b>.

       <b>--sub-filter-regex-...=...</b>
              Set  a  list  of  regular  expressions to match on text subtitles, and remove any lines that match
              (default: empty). This is a string list option. See List Options for details. Normally, you should
              use <b>--sub-filter-regex-append=&lt;regex&gt;</b>, where each option use will append a new regular expression,
              without having to fight escaping problems.

              List items are matched in order. If a regular expression matches, the process is stopped, and  the
              subtitle  line is discarded. The text matched against is, by default, the <b>Text</b> field of ASS events
              (if the subtitle format is different, it is always converted). This may include  formatting  tags.
              Matching  is  case-insensitive, but how this is done depends on the libc, and most likely works in
              ASCII only. It does not work on bitmap/image subtitles. Unavailable  on  inferior  OSes  (requires
              POSIX regex support).

                 Example

                        <b>--sub-filter-regex-append=opensubtitles\.org</b> filters some ads.

              Technically,  using  a  list for matching is redundant, since you could just use a single combined
              regular expression. But it helps with  diagnosis,  ease  of  use,  and  temporarily  disabling  or
              enabling individual filters.

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 This is experimental. The semantics most likely will change, and if you use this, you should be
                 prepared  to update the option later. Ideas include replacing the regexes with a very primitive
                 and small subset of sed, or some method to control case-sensitivity.

       <b>--sub-filter-jsre-...=...</b>
              Same as <b>--sub-filter-regex</b>  but  with  JavaScript  regular  expressions.   Shares/affected-by  all
              <b>--sub-filter-regex-*</b>  control options (see below), and also experimental. Requires only JavaScript
              support.

       <b>--sub-filter-regex-plain=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Whether to first convert the ASS "Text" field to plain-text (default: no).  This strips  ASS  tags
              and  applies  ASS  directives,  like  <b>\N</b> to new-line.  If the result is multi-line then the regexp
              anchors <b>^</b> and <b>$</b> match each line, but still any match discards all lines.

       <b>--sub-filter-regex-warn=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Log dropped lines with warning log level, instead of verbose (default: no).  Helpful for testing.

       <b>--sub-filter-regex-enable=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Whether to enable regex filtering (default: yes). Note  that  if  no  regexes  are  added  to  the
              <b>--sub-filter-regex</b> list, setting this option to <b>yes</b> has no effect. It's meant to easily disable or
              enable filtering temporarily.

       <b>--sub-create-cc-track=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              For  every video stream, create a closed captions track (default: no). The only purpose is to make
              the track available for selection at the start of playback, instead of creating  it  lazily.  This
              applies  only  to  <b>ATSC</b>  <b>A53</b> <b>Part</b> <b>4</b> <b>Closed</b> <b>Captions</b> (displayed by mpv as subtitle tracks using the
              codec <b>eia_608</b>). The CC track is marked "default" and selected according  to  the  normal  subtitle
              track selection rules. You can then use <b>--sid</b> to explicitly select the correct track too.

              If  the  video  stream  contains no closed captions, or if no video is being decoded, the CC track
              will remain empty and will not show any text.

       <b>--sub-font-provider=&lt;auto|none|fontconfig&gt;</b>
              Which libass font provider backend to use (default: auto). <b>auto</b> will attempt  to  use  the  native
              font  provider:  fontconfig on Linux, CoreText on macOS, DirectWrite on Windows. <b>fontconfig</b> forces
              fontconfig, if libass was built with support (if not, it behaves like <b>none</b>).

              The <b>none</b> font provider effectively disables system fonts. It will still attempt  to  use  embedded
              fonts  (unless  <b>--embeddedfonts=no</b>  is  set;  this  is  the  same  behavior as with all other font
              providers), <b>subfont.ttf</b> if provided, and fonts in   the  <b>fonts</b>  sub-directory  if  provided.  (The
              fallback  is  more strict than that of other font providers, and if a font name does not match, it
              may prefer not to render any text that uses the missing font.)

       <b>--sub-fonts-dir=&lt;path&gt;</b>
              Font files in this directory are used by mpv/libass for subtitles. Useful if you do  not  want  to
              install  fonts  to  your  system.  Note that files in this directory are loaded into memory before
              being used by mpv. If you have a lot of fonts, consider using fonts.conf (see  FILES  section)  to
              include additional mpv user settings.

              If this option is not specified, <b>~<a href="file:~/fonts">~/fonts</a></b> will be used by default.

   <b>Window</b>
       <b>--title=&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Set  the  window  title.  This  is used for the video window, and if possible, also sets the audio
              stream title.

              Properties are expanded. (See Property Expansion.)

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 There is a danger of this causing significant CPU usage,  depending  on  the  properties  used.
                 Changing  the  window  title  is  often a slow operation, and if the title changes every frame,
                 playback can be ruined.

       <b>--screen=&lt;default|0-32&gt;</b>
              In multi-monitor configurations (i.e. a single desktop that spans across multiple displays),  this
              option tells mpv which screen to display the video on.

                 Note (X11)

                        This option does not work properly with all window managers. In these cases, you can try
                        to  use <b>--geometry</b> to position the window explicitly. It's also possible that the window
                        manager provides native features to control which  screens  application  windows  should
                        use.

                 Note (Wayland)

                        This  option  does  not  actually work on wayland since window placement is not allowed.
                        However setting this option does influence mpv's initial  guess  at  finding  an  output
                        which may be useful for options like <b>--geometry</b> or <b>--autofit</b> which depend on the monitor
                        resolution.

              See also <b>--fs-screen</b>.

       <b>--screen-name=&lt;string&gt;</b>
              In  multi-monitor configurations, this option tells mpv which screen to display the video on based
              on the screen name from the video backend. The same caveats in  the  <b>--screen</b>  option  also  apply
              here. This option is ignored and does nothing if <b>--screen</b> is explicitly set.

       <b>--fullscreen,</b> <b>--fs</b>
              Fullscreen playback.

       <b>--fs-screen=&lt;all|current|0-32&gt;</b>
              In  multi-monitor configurations (i.e. a single desktop that spans across multiple displays), this
              option tells mpv which screen to go fullscreen to.  If <b>current</b> is used mpv will fallback  on  what
              the user provided with the <b>screen</b> option.

                 Note (X11)

                        This  option  works  properly  only  with  window  managers  which  understand  the EWMH
                        <b>_NET_WM_FULLSCREEN_MONITORS</b> hint.

                 Note (macOS)

                        <b>all</b> does not work on macOS and will behave like <b>current</b>.

              See also <b>--screen</b>.

       <b>--fs-screen-name=&lt;string&gt;</b>
              In multi-monitor configurations, this option tells mpv which screen to go fullscreen to  based  on
              the  screen  name  from  the  video backend. The same caveats in the <b>--fs-screen</b> option also apply
              here. This option is ignored and does nothing if <b>--fs-screen</b> is explicitly set.

       <b>--keep-open=&lt;yes|no|always&gt;</b>
              Do not terminate when playing or seeking beyond the end of the file, and there is no next file  to
              be  played (and <b>--loop</b> is not used).  Instead, pause the player. When trying to seek beyond end of
              the file, the player will attempt to seek to the last frame.

              Normally, this will act like <b>set</b> <b>pause</b> <b>yes</b> on EOF, unless the <b>--keep-open-pause=no</b> option is set.

              The following arguments can be given:

              <b>no</b>     If the current file ends, go to the next file or terminate.  (Default.)

              <b>yes</b>    Don't terminate if the current file is the last playlist entry.  Equivalent to  <b>--keep-open</b>
                     without arguments.

              <b>always</b> Like  <b>yes</b>,  but  also  applies to files before the last playlist entry. This means playback
                     will never automatically advance to the next file.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This option is not respected when using <b>--frames</b>. Explicitly skipping to the next file  if  the
                 binding uses <b>force</b> will terminate playback as well.

                 Also, if errors or unusual circumstances happen, the player can quit anyway.

              Since  mpv  0.6.0,  this doesn't pause if there is a next file in the playlist, or the playlist is
              looped. Approximately, this will pause when the player would normally exit, but in practice  there
              are  corner cases in which this is not the case (e.g. <b>mpv</b> <b>--keep-open</b> <b>file.mkv</b> <b>/dev/null</b> will play
              file.mkv normally, then fail to open <b>/dev/null</b>, then exit). (In mpv 0.8.0, <b>always</b> was  introduced,
              which restores the old behavior.)

       <b>--keep-open-pause=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              If set to <b>no</b>, instead of pausing when <b>--keep-open</b> is active, just stop at end of file and continue
              playing forward when you seek backwards until end where it stops again. Default: <b>yes</b>.

       <b>--image-display-duration=&lt;seconds|inf&gt;</b>
              If  the current file is an image, play the image for the given amount of seconds (default: 5). <b>inf</b>
              means the file is kept open forever (until the user stops playback manually).

              Unlike <b>--keep-open</b>, the player is not paused, but simply continues playback  until  the  time  has
              elapsed. (It should not use any resources during "playback".)

              This  affects image files, which are defined as having only 1 video frame and no audio. The player
              may recognize certain non-images as images, for example if <b>--length</b> is used to reduce  the  length
              to 1 frame, or if you seek to the last frame.

              This  option does not affect the framerate used for <b>mf://</b> or <b>--merge-files</b>. For that, use <b>--mf-fps</b>
              instead.

              When viewing images, the playback time is not tracked on the command line output,  and  the  image
              frame is not duplicated when encoding. To force the player into "dumb mode" and actually count out
              seconds,   or   to   duplicate   the   image   when  encoding,  you  need  to  use  <b>--demuxer=lavf</b>
              <b>--demuxer-lavf-o=loop=1</b>, and use <b>--length</b> or <b>--frames</b> to stop after a particular time.

       <b>--force-window=&lt;yes|no|immediate&gt;</b>
              Create a video output window even if there is no video. This can be useful  when  pretending  that
              mpv  is  a  GUI  application. Currently, the window always has the size 960x540, and is subject to
              <b>--geometry</b>, <b>--autofit</b>, and similar options.

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 The window is created only after initialization (to make sure default  window  placement  still
                 works  if the video size is different from the <b>--force-window</b> default window size). This can be
                 a problem if initialization doesn't work perfectly, such as when opening URLs with bad  network
                 connection,  or opening broken video files. The <b>immediate</b> mode can be used to create the window
                 always on program start, but this may cause other issues.

       <b>--taskbar-progress=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              (Windows only) Enable/disable playback progress rendering in taskbar (Windows 7 and above).

              Enabled by default.

       <b>--snap-window</b>
              (Windows only) Snap the player window to screen edges.

       <b>--drag-and-drop=&lt;no|auto|replace|append|insert-next&gt;</b>
              Controls the default behavior of drag and drop on platforms that support this. <b>auto</b> will obey what
              the underlying os/platform gives mpv.  Typically, holding shift during  the  drag  and  drop  will
              append  the  item  to the playlist. Otherwise, it will completely replace it. <b>replace</b>, <b>append</b>, and
              <b>insert-next</b>  always  force  replacing,  appending  to,  and  inserting  next  into  the   playlist
              respectively. <b>no</b> disables all drag and drop behavior.

       <b>--ontop</b>
              Makes the player window stay on top of other windows.

              On  Windows,  if  combined  with  fullscreen  mode,  this  causes  mpv  to be treated as exclusive
              fullscreen window that bypasses the Desktop Window Manager.

       <b>--ontop-level=&lt;window|system|desktop|level&gt;</b>
              (macOS only) Sets the level of an on-top window (default: window).

              <b>window</b> On top of all other windows.

              <b>system</b> On top of system elements like Taskbar, Menubar and Dock.

              <b>desktop</b>
                     On top of the Desktop behind windows and Desktop icons.

              <b>level</b>  A level as integer.

       <b>--focus-on=&lt;never|open|all&gt;,</b>
              (macOS only) Focus the video window and make it the front most window on specific events (default:
              open).

              <b>never</b>  Never focus the window on open or new file load events.

              <b>open</b>   Focus the window on creation, eg when a vo is initialised.

              <b>all</b>    Focus the window on open and new file load event.

       <b>--window-corners=&lt;default|donotround|round|roundsmall&gt;</b>
              (Windows only) Set the preference for window corner rounding.

              <b>default</b>
                     Let the system decide whether or not to round window corners

              <b>donotround</b>
                     Never round window corners

              <b>round</b>  Round the corners if appropriate

              <b>roundsmall</b>
                     Round the corners if appropriate, with a small radius

       <b>--border=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Play video with window border and decorations. Since this is on by  default,  use  <b>--no-border</b>  to
              disable the standard window decorations.

       <b>--title-bar=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              (Windows  and  X11  only)  Play  video with the window title bar. Since this is on by default, use
              <b>--title-bar=no</b> to hide the title bar. The <b>--border</b> option takes precedence.

       <b>--on-all-workspaces</b>
              (X11 and macOS only) Show the video window on all virtual desktops.

       <b>--geometry=&lt;[W[xH]][+-x+-y][/WS]&gt;,</b> <b>--geometry=&lt;x:y&gt;</b>
              Adjust the initial window position or size. <b>W</b> and <b>H</b> set the window size in pixels. <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> set the
              window position, measured in pixels from the top-left corner of the screen to the top-left  corner
              of  the  image being displayed. If a percentage sign (<b>%</b>) is given after the argument, it turns the
              value into a percentage of the screen size in that direction.  Positions are specified similar  to
              the  standard  X11  <b>--geometry</b> option format, in which e.g. +10-50 means "place 10 pixels from the
              left border and 50 pixels from the lower border" and "--20+-10" means "place 20 pixels beyond  the
              right  and  10 pixels beyond the top border". A trailing <b>/</b> followed by an integer denotes on which
              workspace (virtual desktop) the window should appear (X11 only).

              If an external window is specified using the <b>--wid</b> option, this option is ignored.

              The coordinates are relative to the screen given with <b>--screen</b> for the video output  drivers  that
              fully support <b>--screen</b>.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Generally only supported by GUI VOs. Ignored for encoding.

                 Note (macOS)

                        On  macOS,  the  origin  of  the  screen coordinate system is located on the bottom-left
                        corner. For instance, <b>0:0</b> will place the window at the bottom-left of the screen.

                 Note (X11)

                        This option does not work properly with all window managers.

                 Note (Wayland)

                        Wayland does not allow a client to position itself so this option will only  affect  the
                        window size.

                 Examples

                 <b>50:40</b>  Places the window at x=50, y=40.

                 <b>50%:50%</b>
                        Places the window in the middle of the screen.

                 <b>100%:100%</b>
                        Places the window at the bottom right corner of the screen.

                 <b>50%</b>    Sets  the window width to half the screen width. Window height is set so that the window
                        has the video aspect ratio.

                 <b>50%x50%</b>
                        Forces the window width and height to half the screen width and height. Will show  black
                        borders   to   compensate   for   the  video  aspect  ratio  (with  most  VOs  and  with
                        <b>--keepaspect=yes</b>).

                 <b>50%+10+10/2</b>
                        Sets the window to half the screen widths, and positions it 10 pixels below/left of  the
                        top left corner of the screen, on the second workspace.

              See  also <b>--autofit</b> and <b>--autofit-larger</b> for fitting the window into a given size without changing
              aspect ratio.

       <b>--autofit=&lt;[W[xH]]&gt;</b>
              Set the initial window size to a maximum size specified by  <b>WxH</b>,  without  changing  the  window's
              aspect ratio. The size is measured in pixels, or if a number is followed by a percentage sign (<b>%</b>),
              in percents of the screen size.

              This  option  never  changes  the  aspect ratio of the window. If the aspect ratio mismatches, the
              window's size is reduced until it fits into the specified size.

              Window position is not taken into account, nor is it modified by this option (the  window  manager
              still  may  place  the  window differently depending on size). Use <b>--geometry</b> to change the window
              position. Its effects are applied after this option.

              See <b>--geometry</b> for details how this is handled with multi-monitor setups.

              Use <b>--autofit-larger</b> instead if you just want to limit the maximum size of the window, rather than
              always forcing a window size.

              Use <b>--geometry</b> if you want to force both window width and height to a specific size.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Generally only supported by GUI VOs. Ignored for encoding.

                 Examples

                 <b>70%</b>    Make the window width 70% of the screen size, keeping aspect ratio.

                 <b>1000</b>   Set the window width to 1000 pixels, keeping aspect ratio.

                 <b>70%x60%</b>
                        Make the window as large as possible, without being wider than 70% of the screen  width,
                        or higher than 60% of the screen height.

       <b>--autofit-larger=&lt;[W[xH]]&gt;</b>
              This option behaves exactly like <b>--autofit</b>, except that it sets the maximum size of the window.

                 Example

                 <b>90%x80%</b>
                        If  the  video  is larger than 90% of the screen width or 80% of the screen height, make
                        the window smaller until either its width is 90% of the screen, or its height is 80%  of
                        the screen.

       <b>--autofit-smaller=&lt;[W[xH]]&gt;</b>
              This  option  behaves  exactly  like <b>--autofit</b>, except that it sets the minimum size of the window
              (just as <b>--autofit-larger</b> sets the maximum).

                 Example

                 <b>500x500</b>
                        Make the window at least 500 pixels wide and 500 pixels high  (depending  on  the  video
                        aspect  ratio,  the  width or height will be larger than 500 in order to keep the aspect
                        ratio the same).

       <b>--window-scale=&lt;factor&gt;</b>
              Resize the video window to a multiple (or fraction) of the video  size.  This  option  is  applied
              before  <b>--autofit</b>  and  other  options  are  applied (so they override this option). Changing this
              option while the window is maximized can unmaximize the window depending  on  the  OS  and  window
              manager.   If  the  window  does  not  unmaximize,  the  multiplier  will  be  applied if the user
              unmaximizes the window later.

              For example, <b>--window-scale=0.5</b> would show the window at half the video size.

       <b>--window-minimized=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Whether the video window is minimized or not. Setting this will minimize, or unminimize, the video
              window if the current VO supports it. Note that  some  VOs  may  support  minimization  while  not
              supporting unminimization (eg: Wayland).

              Whether  this  option  and  <b>--window-maximized</b>  work  on  program start or at runtime, and whether
              they're (at runtime) updated to reflect the actual window state, heavily depends on the VO and the
              windowing system. Some VOs simply do not implement them or parts of them, while other VOs  may  be
              restricted by the windowing systems (especially Wayland).

       <b>--window-maximized=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Whether the video window is maximized or not. Setting this will maximize, or unmaximize, the video
              window if the current VO supports it. See <b>--window-minimized</b> for further remarks.

       <b>--cursor-autohide=&lt;number|no|always&gt;</b>
              Make  mouse  cursor  automatically  hide after given number of milliseconds (default: 1000 ms). <b>no</b>
              will disable cursor autohide. <b>always</b> means the cursor will stay hidden.

       <b>--cursor-autohide-fs-only</b>
              If this option is given, the cursor is always visible in windowed mode. In  fullscreen  mode,  the
              cursor is shown or hidden according to <b>--cursor-autohide</b>.

       <b>--force-rgba-osd-rendering</b>
              Change  how  some video outputs render the OSD and text subtitles. This does not change appearance
              of the subtitles and only has performance implications. For VOs which support native ASS rendering
              (like <b>gpu</b>, <b>vdpau</b>, <b>direct3d</b>), this can be slightly faster or slower, depending on GPU  drivers  and
              hardware. For other VOs, this just makes rendering slower.

       <b>--force-render</b>
              Forces  mpv  to  always  render  frames regardless of the visibility of the window. Currently only
              affects X11 and Wayland VOs since they are  the  only  ones  that  have  this  optimization  (i.e.
              everything else always renders regardless of visibility).

       <b>--force-window-position</b>
              Forcefully  move mpv's video output window to default location whenever there is a change in video
              parameters, video stream or file. This used to be the default  behavior.  Currently  only  affects
              X11, macvk and SDL VOs.

       <b>--auto-window-resize=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              By  default,  mpv  will  automatically  resize  itself if the video's size changes (i.e. advancing
              forward in a playlist). Setting this to <b>no</b> disables this behavior so the window size never changes
              automatically. This option does not have any impact on the <b>--autofit</b> or <b>--geometry</b> options.

       <b>--keepaspect=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              <b>--keepaspect=no</b> will always stretch the video to window size, and will disable the window  manager
              hints that force the window aspect ratio.  (Ignored in fullscreen mode.)

       <b>--keepaspect-window=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              <b>--keepaspect-window=yes</b>   (the   default)   will  lock  the  window  size  to  the  video  aspect.
              <b>--keepaspect-window=no</b> disables this behavior, and will instead add black bars  if  window  aspect
              and  video  aspect  mismatch.  Whether this actually works depends on the VO backend.  (Ignored in
              fullscreen mode.)

       <b>--monitoraspect=&lt;ratio&gt;</b>
              Set the aspect ratio of your monitor or TV screen. A value of 0 disables a previous setting  (e.g.
              in the config file). Overrides the <b>--monitorpixelaspect</b> setting if enabled.

              See also <b>--monitorpixelaspect</b> and <b>--video-aspect-override</b>.

                 Examples

                 • <b>--monitoraspect=4:3</b>  or <b>--monitoraspect=1.3333</b>

                 • <b>--monitoraspect=16:9</b> or <b>--monitoraspect=1.7777</b>

       <b>--hidpi-window-scale=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Scale  the  window  size  according to the backing DPI scale factor from the OS (default: no). For
              example, if the OS DPI scaling is set to 200%, mpv's window size will be multiplied by 2.

       <b>--native-fs=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              (macOS only) Uses the native fullscreen mechanism of the OS (default: yes).

       <b>--show-in-taskbar=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              (Windows and X11 only) Show mpv in the taskbar (default: yes). If set to no, mpv  will  no  longer
              appear  in  taskbars  and tasklists in supported window managers, and may be excluded from Alt+Tab
              window switching.

       <b>--monitorpixelaspect=&lt;ratio&gt;</b>
              Set the aspect of a single pixel of your monitor or TV screen (default: 1). A  value  of  1  means
              square    pixels    (correct   for   (almost?)   all   LCDs).   See   also   <b>--monitoraspect</b>   and
              <b>--video-aspect-override</b>.

       <b>--stop-screensaver=&lt;yes|no|always&gt;</b>
              Turns off the screensaver (or screen blanker and similar mechanisms) at startup and  turns  it  on
              again  on exit (default: yes). When using <b>yes</b>, the screensaver will re-enable when playback is not
              active. <b>always</b> will always disable the screensaver. Note that stopping  the  screensaver  is  only
              possible if a video output is available (i.e. there is an open mpv window).  This is not supported
              on all video outputs, platforms, or desktop environments.

              Before  mpv  0.33.0,  the  X11  backend  ran <b>xdg-screensaver</b> <b>reset</b> in 10 second intervals when not
              paused in order to support screensaver inhibition in some  environments.  This  functionality  was
              removed in 0.33.0, but it is possible to call the <b>xdg-screensaver</b> command line program from a user
              script instead.

       <b>--wid=&lt;ID&gt;</b>
              This  tells mpv to attach to an existing window. If a VO is selected that supports this option, it
              will use that window for video output. mpv will scale the video to the size of  this  window,  and
              will add black bars to compensate if the aspect ratio of the video is different.

              On  X11, the ID is interpreted as a <b>Window</b> on X11. Unlike MPlayer/mplayer2, mpv always creates its
              own window, and sets the wid window as parent. The window will always  be  resized  to  cover  the
              parent  window fully. The value <b>0</b> is interpreted specially, and mpv will draw directly on the root
              window.

              On win32, the ID is interpreted as <b>HWND</b>. Pass it as value cast to <b>uint32_t</b>  (all  Windows  handles
              are  32-bit),  this  is  important as mpv will not accept negative values. mpv will create its own
              window and set the wid window as parent, like with X11.

              On Android, the ID is interpreted as <b>android.view.Surface</b>. Pass it as a value  cast  to  <b>intptr_t</b>.
              Use  with  <b>--vo=mediacodec_embed</b>  and <b>--hwdec=mediacodec</b> for direct rendering using MediaCodec, or
              with <b>--vo=gpu</b> <b>--gpu-context=android</b> (with or without <b>--hwdec=mediacodec</b>).

       <b>--window-dragging=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Move the window when clicking on it and moving the mouse pointer (default: yes).

       <b>--x11-name=&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Set the window instance name for X11-based video output methods.

       <b>--x11-netwm=&lt;yes|no|auto&gt;</b>
              (X11 only) Control the use of NetWM protocol features.

              This may or may not help with broken window managers. This provides some  functionality  that  was
              implemented  by  the  now removed <b>--fstype</b> option.  Actually, it is not known to the developers to
              which degree this option was needed, so feedback is welcome.

              Specifically, <b>yes</b> will force use of NetWM fullscreen support, even if not advertised  by  the  WM.
              This  can  be  useful  for WMs that are broken on purpose, like XMonad. (XMonad supposedly doesn't
              advertise fullscreen support, because Flash uses it. Apparently, applications which  want  to  use
              fullscreen  anyway are supposed to either ignore the NetWM support hints, or provide a workaround.
              Shame on XMonad for deliberately breaking X protocols (as if X isn't bad enough already).

              By default, NetWM support is autodetected (<b>auto</b>).

              This option might be removed in the future.

       <b>--x11-bypass-compositor=&lt;yes|no|fs-only|never&gt;</b>
              If set to <b>yes</b>, then ask the compositor to unredirect the mpv window (default: <b>fs-only</b>). This  uses
              the <b>_NET_WM_BYPASS_COMPOSITOR</b> hint.

              <b>fs-only</b> asks the window manager to disable the compositor only in fullscreen mode.

              <b>no</b>  sets  <b>_NET_WM_BYPASS_COMPOSITOR</b>  to  0,  which  is  the  default value as declared by the EWMH
              specification, i.e. no change is done.

              <b>never</b> asks the window manager to never disable the compositor.

       <b>--x11-present=&lt;no|auto|yes&gt;</b>
              Whether or not to use presentation statistics from X11's presentation extension (default: <b>auto</b>).

              mpv asks X11 for present events which it then may use for more accurate frame  presentation.  This
              only has an effect if <b>--video-sync=display-...</b>  is being used.

              The  auto  option enumerates XRandr providers for autodetection. If amd, radeon, intel, or nouveau
              (the standard x86 Mesa drivers) is found presentation feedback is enabled. Other drivers  are  not
              assumed to work, so they are not enabled automatically.

              <b>yes</b>  or  <b>no</b>  can  still  be  passed  regardless  to enable/disable this mechanism in case there is
              good/bad behavior with whatever your combination of hardware/drivers/etc. happens to be.

       <b>--x11-wid-title=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Whether or not to set the window title when mpv is embedded on X11 (default: <b>no</b>).

   <b>Disc</b> <b>Devices</b>
       <b>--cdda-device=&lt;path&gt;</b>
              Specify the CD device for CDDA playback. The default device  path  depends  on  the  OS.  See  the
              OPTICAL DRIVES section.

       <b>--dvd-device=&lt;path&gt;</b>
              Specify  the  DVD  device  or  .iso filename. You can also specify a directory that contains files
              previously copied directly from a DVD (with e.g. vobcopy). The default device path depends on  the
              OS. See the OPTICAL DRIVES section.

                 Example

                        <b>mpv</b> <b>dvd://</b> <b>--dvd-device=/path/to/dvd/</b>

       <b>--bluray-device=&lt;path&gt;</b>
              Specify  the Blu-ray disc location. Must be a directory with Blu-ray structure. The default device
              path depends on the OS. See the OPTICAL DRIVES section.

                 Example

                        <b>mpv</b> <b>bd://</b> <b>--bluray-device=/path/to/bd/</b>

       <b>--cdda-...</b>
              These options can be used to tune the CD Audio reading feature of mpv.

       <b>--cdda-speed=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Set CD spin speed.

       <b>--cdda-paranoia=&lt;0-2&gt;</b>
              Set paranoia level. Values other than 0 seem to break playback of anything but the first track.

              <b>0</b>      disable checking (default)

              <b>1</b>      overlap checking only

              <b>2</b>      full data correction and verification

       <b>--cdda-sector-size=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Set atomic read size.

       <b>--cdda-overlap=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Force minimum overlap search during verification to &lt;value&gt; sectors.

       <b>--cdda-toc-offset=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Add <b>&lt;value&gt;</b> sectors to the values reported when addressing tracks.  May be negative.

       <b>--cdda-skip=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              (Never) accept imperfect data reconstruction.

       <b>--cdda-cdtext=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Print CD text. This is disabled by default, because it ruins performance with  CD-ROM  drives  for
              unknown reasons.

       <b>--dvd-speed=&lt;speed&gt;</b>
              Try  to  limit  DVD speed (default: 0, no change). DVD base speed is 1385 kB/s, so an 8x drive can
              read at speeds up to 11080 kB/s. Slower speeds make the drive more quiet. For watching DVDs,  2700
              kB/s  should  be  quiet and fast enough. mpv resets the speed to the drive default value on close.
              Values of at least 100 mean speed in kB/s. Values less than 100 mean multiples of 1385 kB/s,  i.e.
              <b>--dvd-speed=8</b> selects 11080 kB/s.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 You need write access to the DVD device to change the speed.

       <b>--dvd-angle=&lt;ID&gt;</b>
              Some  DVDs  contain  scenes  that can be viewed from multiple angles.  This option tells mpv which
              angle to use (default: 1).

   <b>Equalizer</b>
       <b>--brightness=&lt;-100-100&gt;</b>
              Adjust the brightness of the video signal (default: 0). Not supported by all video output drivers.

       <b>--contrast=&lt;-100-100&gt;</b>
              Adjust the contrast of the video signal (default: 0). Not supported by all video output drivers.

       <b>--saturation=&lt;-100-100&gt;</b>
              Adjust the saturation of the video signal (default: 0). You can get  grayscale  output  with  this
              option. Not supported by all video output drivers.

       <b>--gamma=&lt;-100-100&gt;</b>
              Adjust the gamma of the video signal (default: 0). Not supported by all video output drivers.

       <b>--hue=&lt;-100-100&gt;</b>
              Adjust  the hue of the video signal (default: 0). You can get a colored negative of the image with
              this option. Not supported by all video output drivers.

   <b>Demuxer</b>
       <b>--demuxer=&lt;[+]name&gt;</b>
              Force demuxer type. Use a '+' before the name to force it; this will skip some  checks.  Give  the
              demuxer name as printed by <b>--demuxer=help</b>.

       <b>--demuxer-lavf-analyzeduration=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Maximum length in seconds to analyze the stream properties.

       <b>--demuxer-lavf-probe-info=&lt;yes|no|auto|nostreams&gt;</b>
              Whether   to  probe  stream  information  (default:  auto).  Technically,  this  controls  whether
              libavformat's <b>avformat_find_stream_info()</b> function is called. Usually it's safer to call  it,  but
              it can also make startup slower.

              The  <b>auto</b>  choice  (the default) tries to skip this for a few know-safe whitelisted formats, while
              calling it for everything else.

              The <b>nostreams</b> choice only calls it if and only if the file  seems  to  contain  no  streams  after
              opening  (helpful  in  cases when calling the function is needed to detect streams at all, such as
              with FLV files).

       <b>--demuxer-lavf-probescore=&lt;1-100&gt;</b>
              Minimum required libavformat probe score. Lower values will require less data to be loaded  (makes
              streams  start  faster),  but  makes  file  format  detection  less reliable. Can be used to force
              auto-detected libavformat demuxers, even if  libavformat  considers  the  detection  not  reliable
              enough. (Default: 26.)

       <b>--demuxer-lavf-allow-mimetype=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Allow  deriving  the format from the HTTP MIME type (default: yes). Set this to no in case playing
              things from HTTP mysteriously fails, even though the same files work from local disk.

              This is default in order to reduce latency when opening HTTP streams.

       <b>--demuxer-lavf-format=&lt;name&gt;</b>
              Force a specific libavformat demuxer.

       <b>--demuxer-lavf-hacks=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              By default, some formats will be handled differently from other formats by explicitly checking for
              them. Most of these compensate for weird or imperfect behavior from libavformat demuxers.  Passing
              <b>no</b> disables these. For debugging and testing only.

       <b>--demuxer-lavf-o=&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;[,&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;[,...]]</b>
              Pass AVOptions to libavformat demuxer.

              Note,  a patch to make the <u>o=</u> unneeded and pass all unknown options through the AVOption system is
              welcome. A full list of AVOptions can be found in the FFmpeg manual. Note that  some  options  may
              conflict with mpv options.

              This is a key/value list option. See List Options for details.

                 Example

                        <b>--demuxer-lavf-o=fflags=+ignidx</b>

       <b>--demuxer-lavf-probesize=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Maximum  amount  of  data  to  probe during the detection phase. In the case of MPEG-TS this value
              identifies the maximum number of TS packets to scan.

       <b>--demuxer-lavf-buffersize=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Size of the stream read buffer allocated for libavformat in bytes (default: 32768).  Lowering  the
              size  could  lower  latency.  Note that libavformat might reallocate the buffer internally, or not
              fully use all of it.

       <b>--demuxer-lavf-linearize-timestamps=&lt;yes|no|auto&gt;</b>
              Attempt to linearize timestamp resets in demuxed streams (default: auto).  This  was  tested  only
              for  single  audio  streams. It's unknown whether it works correctly for video (but likely won't).
              Note that the implementation is slightly incorrect either way, and will introduce a  discontinuity
              by about 1 codec frame size.

              The  <b>auto</b>  mode enables this for OGG audio stream. This covers the common and annoying case of OGG
              web radio streams. Some of these will reset timestamps to 0 every time a  new  song  begins.  This
              breaks   the   mpv   seekable   cache,   which   can't  deal  with  timestamp  resets.  Note  that
              FFmpeg/libavformat's seeking API can't deal with this either; it's  likely  that  if  this  option
              breaks  this even more, while if it's disabled, you can at least seek within the first song in the
              stream. Well, you won't get anything useful either way if the seek is outside of mpv's cache.

       <b>--demuxer-lavf-propagate-opts=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Propagate FFmpeg-level options to recursively opened connections (default: yes).  This  is  needed
              because FFmpeg will apply these settings to nested AVIO contexts automatically. On the other hand,
              this could break in certain situations - it's the FFmpeg API, you just can't win.

              This affects in particular the <b>--timeout</b> option and anything passed with <b>--demuxer-lavf-o</b>.

              If  this  option  is  deemed  unnecessary  at some point in the future, it will be removed without
              notice.

       <b>--demuxer-mkv-subtitle-preroll=&lt;yes|index|no&gt;</b>
              Try harder to show embedded soft subtitles when seeking somewhere. Normally, it  can  happen  that
              the  subtitle at the seek target is not shown due to how some container file formats are designed.
              The subtitles appear only if seeking before or exactly to the position a subtitle  first  appears.
              To  make this worse, subtitles are often timed to appear a very small amount before the associated
              video frame, so that seeking to the video frame typically does not  demux  the  subtitle  at  that
              position.

              Enabling  this  option  makes the demuxer start reading data a bit before the seek target, so that
              subtitles appear correctly. Note that this makes seeking slower, and is not guaranteed  to  always
              work. It only works if the subtitle is close enough to the seek target.

              Works  with the internal Matroska demuxer only. Always enabled for absolute and hr-seeks, and this
              option changes behavior with relative or imprecise seeks only.

              You can use the <b>--demuxer-mkv-subtitle-preroll-secs</b> option to specify how much  data  the  demuxer
              should pre-read at most in order to find subtitle packets that may overlap. Setting this to 0 will
              effectively disable this preroll mechanism. Setting a very large value can make seeking very slow,
              and  an extremely large value would completely reread the entire file from start to seek target on
              every seek - seeking can become slower towards the end of the file. The details are messy, and the
              value is actually rounded down to the cluster with the previous video keyframe.

              Some files, especially files muxed with newer mkvmerge versions, have  information  embedded  that
              can  be  used  to  determine what subtitle packets overlap with a seek target. In these cases, mpv
              will reduce the amount of data read to a minimum. (Although it will still read  <u>all</u>  data  between
              the  cluster  that  contains  the first wanted subtitle packet, and the seek target.) If the <b>index</b>
              choice (which is the default) is specified, then prerolling will be done only if this  information
              is  actually  available.  If  this  method  is  used,  the  maximum  amount of data to skip can be
              additionally controlled by <b>--demuxer-mkv-subtitle-preroll-secs-index</b> (it still uses the  value  of
              the option without <b>-index</b> if that is higher).

              See  also  <b>--hr-seek-demuxer-offset</b>  option. This option can achieve a similar effect, but only if
              hr-seek is active. It works with any demuxer, but makes seeking much slower, as it has  to  decode
              audio and video data instead of just skipping over it.

       <b>--demuxer-mkv-subtitle-preroll-secs=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              See <b>--demuxer-mkv-subtitle-preroll</b>.

       <b>--demuxer-mkv-subtitle-preroll-secs-index=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              See <b>--demuxer-mkv-subtitle-preroll</b>.

       <b>--demuxer-mkv-probe-start-time=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Check  the  start  time  of  Matroska  files  (default:  yes). This simply reads the first cluster
              timestamps and assumes it is the start time. Technically, this also  reads  the  first  timestamp,
              which may increase latency by one frame (which may be relevant for live streams).

       <b>--demuxer-mkv-probe-video-duration=&lt;yes|no|full&gt;</b>
              When  opening the file, seek to the end of it, and check what timestamp the last video packet has,
              and report that as file duration. This is strictly for compatibility  with  Haali  only.  In  this
              mode,  it's  possible  that  opening  will  be slower (especially when playing over http), or that
              behavior with broken files is much worse. So don't use this option.

              The <b>yes</b> mode merely uses the index and reads a small number of blocks from the end  of  the  file.
              The  <b>full</b> mode actually traverses the entire file and can make a reliable estimate even without an
              index present (such as partial files).

       <b>--demuxer-mkv-crop-compat=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Enable compatibility mode for files that do not fully  comply  with  the  Matroska  specification.
              (default: yes)

              Most files containing cropping metadata require this mode to display correctly.

              If  this  option  is  enabled, crop metadata will be applied before calculating the video's aspect
              ratio, ensuring it is cropped accordingly. If this option is disabled, the image will  be  cropped
              first and then stretched to match DisplayWidth and DisplayHeight.

              According  to  the Matroska specification, the Pixel Aspect Ratio (PAR) should be calculated after
              cropping. However, the majority  of  files  do  not  adhere  to  this  rule,  as  it  would  cause
              incompatibility with crop-unaware players.  Additionally, MKVToolNix does not automatically adjust
              DisplayWidth and DisplayHeight when cropping metadata is applied, leading to most of files created
              with it also failing to conform to the specification.

       <b>--demuxer-rawaudio-channels=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Number of channels (or channel layout) if <b>--demuxer=rawaudio</b> is used (default: stereo).

       <b>--demuxer-rawaudio-format=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Sample  format for <b>--demuxer=rawaudio</b> (default: s16le).  Use <b>--demuxer-rawaudio-format=help</b> to get
              a list of all formats.

       <b>--demuxer-rawaudio-rate=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Sample rate for <b>--demuxer=rawaudio</b> (default: 44 kHz).

       <b>--demuxer-rawvideo-fps=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Rate in frames per second for <b>--demuxer=rawvideo</b> (default: 25.0).

       <b>--demuxer-rawvideo-w=&lt;value&gt;,</b> <b>--demuxer-rawvideo-h=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Image dimension in pixels for <b>--demuxer=rawvideo</b>.

                 Example

                        Play a raw YUV sample:

                     mpv sample-720x576.yuv --demuxer=rawvideo \
                     --demuxer-rawvideo-w=720 --demuxer-rawvideo-h=576

       <b>--demuxer-rawvideo-format=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Color space (fourcc) in hex or string for <b>--demuxer=rawvideo</b> (default: <b>YV12</b>).

       <b>--demuxer-rawvideo-mp-format=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Color space by internal video format for <b>--demuxer=rawvideo</b>. Use <b>--demuxer-rawvideo-mp-format=help</b>
              for a list of possible formats.

       <b>--demuxer-rawvideo-codec=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Set the video codec instead of selecting the rawvideo codec when  using  <b>--demuxer=rawvideo</b>.  This
              uses the same values as codec names in <b>--vd</b> (but it does not accept decoder names).

       <b>--demuxer-rawvideo-size=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Frame size in bytes when using <b>--demuxer=rawvideo</b>.

       <b>--demuxer-max-bytes=&lt;bytesize&gt;</b>
              This  controls  how  much the demuxer is allowed to buffer ahead. The demuxer will normally try to
              read ahead as much as necessary, or as much is requested with <b>--demuxer-readahead-secs</b>. The option
              can be used to restrict the maximum readahead. This limits excessive readahead in case  of  broken
              files or desynced playback. The demuxer will stop reading additional packets as soon as one of the
              limits is reached. (The limits still can be slightly overstepped due to technical reasons.)

              Set  these limits higher if you get a packet queue overflow warning, and you think normal playback
              would be possible with a larger packet queue.

              See <b>--list-options</b> for defaults and value range. <b>&lt;bytesize&gt;</b> options accept suffixes  such  as  <b>KiB</b>
              and <b>MiB</b>.

       <b>--demuxer-max-back-bytes=&lt;bytesize&gt;</b>
              This  controls  how  much past data the demuxer is allowed to preserve. This is useful only if the
              cache is enabled.

              Unlike the forward cache, there is no control how many seconds  are  actually  cached  -  it  will
              simply  use  as much memory this option allows. Setting this option to 0 will strictly disable any
              back buffer, but this will lead to the situation that the forward  seek  range  starts  after  the
              current playback position (as it removes past packets that are seek points).

              If  the  end of the file is reached, the remaining unused forward buffer space is "donated" to the
              backbuffer (unless the backbuffer size is set to 0, or  <b>--demuxer-donate-buffer</b>  is  set  to  <b>no</b>).
              This  still  limits  the  total  cache  usage  to  the  sum of the forward and backward cache, and
              effectively makes better use of the total allowed memory budget. (The opposite  does  not  happen:
              free backward buffer is never "donated" to the forward buffer.)

              Keep  in  mind  that  other  buffers in the player (like decoders) will cause the demuxer to cache
              "future" frames in the back buffer, which  can  skew  the  impression  about  how  much  data  the
              backbuffer contains.

              See <b>--list-options</b> for defaults and value range.

       <b>--demuxer-donate-buffer=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Whether  to let the back buffer use part of the forward buffer (default: yes).  If set to <b>yes</b>, the
              "donation" behavior described in the option description for <b>--demuxer-max-back-bytes</b>  is  enabled.
              This means the back buffer may use up memory up to the sum of the forward and back buffer options,
              minus  the active size of the forward buffer. If set to <b>no</b>, the options strictly limit the forward
              and back buffer sizes separately.

              Note that if the end of the file is reached, the buffered data stays the same, even  if  you  seek
              back within the cache. This is because the back buffer is only reduced when new data is read.

       <b>--demuxer-seekable-cache=&lt;yes|no|auto&gt;</b>
              Debugging  option  to  control whether seeking can use the demuxer cache (default: auto). Normally
              you don't ever need to set this; the default <b>auto</b> does the right thing and enables  cache  seeking
              it if <b>--cache</b> is set to <b>yes</b> (or is implied <b>yes</b> if <b>--cache=auto</b>).

              If  enabled, short seek offsets will not trigger a low level demuxer seek (which means for example
              that slow network round trips or FFmpeg seek bugs can be avoided). If a seek cannot happen  within
              the  cached  range,  a low level seek will be triggered. Seeking outside of the cache will start a
              new cached range, but can discard the old cache range if the demuxer exhibits certain  unsupported
              behavior.

              The  special  value  <b>auto</b>  means  <b>yes</b> in the same situation as <b>--cache-secs</b> is used (i.e. when the
              stream appears to be a network stream or the stream cache is enabled).

       <b>--demuxer-thread=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Run the demuxer in a separate thread, and let it prefetch a certain amount  of  packets  (default:
              yes).  Having  this  enabled  leads  to  smoother playback, enables features like prefetching, and
              prevents that stuck network freezes the player. On the other hand, it can  add  overhead,  or  the
              background prefetching can hog CPU resources.

              Disabling this option is not recommended. Use it for debugging only.

       <b>--demuxer-termination-timeout=&lt;seconds&gt;</b>
              Number  of  seconds the player should wait to shutdown the demuxer (default: 0.1). The player will
              wait up to this much time before it closes the stream layer forcefully. Forceful  closing  usually
              means the network I/O is given no chance to close its connections gracefully (of course the OS can
              still  close TCP connections properly), and might result in annoying messages being logged, and in
              some cases, confused remote servers.

              This timeout is usually only applied when loading has finished properly. If loading is aborted  by
              the  user,  or  in  some  corner  cases  like removing external tracks sourced from network during
              playback, forceful closing is always used.

       <b>--demuxer-readahead-secs=&lt;seconds&gt;</b>
              If <b>--demuxer-thread</b> is enabled, this controls how much the demuxer should buffer ahead in  seconds
              (default:  1).  As  long  as no packet has a timestamp difference higher than the readahead amount
              relative to the last packet returned to the decoder, the demuxer keeps reading.

              Note that enabling the cache (such as <b>--cache=yes</b>, or if the input is considered a network stream,
              and <b>--cache=auto</b> is used), this option  is  mostly  ignored.  (<b>--cache-secs</b>  will  override  this.
              Technically, the maximum of both options is used.)

              The  main  purpose  of  this  option  is  to  limit the readhead for local playback, since a large
              readahead value is not overly useful in this case.

              (This value tends to be fuzzy, because many file formats don't store linear timestamps.)

       <b>--demuxer-hysteresis-secs=&lt;seconds&gt;</b>
              Once the demuxer limit is reached (<b>--demuxer-max-bytes</b>, <b>--demuxer-readahead-secs</b> or <b>--cache-secs</b>),
              this value can be used to specify a hysteresis before the demuxer will buffer  ahead  again.  This
              specifies  the  maximum  number  of  seconds  from  the current playback position that needs to be
              remaining in the cache before the demuxer will continue buffering ahead.

              For example, with a value of 10 seconds specified, the demuxer will buffer ahead up to the demuxer
              limit and won't start buffering ahead again until there is only 10 seconds of content left in  the
              cache.

              This can provide significant power savings and reduce load by making the demuxer only buffer ahead
              in chunks at a time rather than buffering ahead nonstop to keep the cache filled.

              If you want to save power and reduce load, configure this to a small number that's much lower than
              <b>--cache-secs</b> or <b>--demuxer-readahead-secs</b>.  If it takes a long time to buffer anything at all for a
              given  stream  (like  when  reading  from a very slow disk is involved), then the hysteresis value
              should be larger to compensate.

              The default value is 0 seconds, which disables the caching  hysteresis.  A  value  of  10  seconds
              probably works well for most usecases.

       <b>--prefetch-playlist=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Prefetch next playlist entry while playback of the current entry is ending (default: yes).

              This  does  not  prefill the cache with the video data of the next URL.  Prefetching video data is
              supported only for the current playlist entry, and depends on the demuxer cache  settings  (on  by
              default).  This  merely  opens the URL of the next playlist entry as soon the current URL is fully
              read.

              This does <b>not</b> work with URLs resolved by the <b>youtube-dl</b> wrapper, and it won't.

              This can occasionally make wrong prefetching decisions. For example, it can't predict whether  you
              go backwards in the playlist, and assumes you won't edit the playlist.

       <b>--force-seekable=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              If  the  player  thinks  that the media is not seekable (e.g. playing from a pipe, or it's an http
              stream with a server that doesn't support range requests), seeking will be disabled.  This  option
              can forcibly enable it.  For seeks within the cache, there's a good chance of success.

       <b>--demuxer-cache-wait=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Before  starting  playback, read data until either the end of the file was reached, or the demuxer
              cache has reached maximum capacity. Only once this is done, playback  starts.  This  intentionally
              happens  before the initial seek triggered with <b>--start</b>. This does not change any runtime behavior
              after the initial caching. This option is useless if the file cannot be cached completely.

       <b>--rar-list-all-volumes=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              When opening multi-volume rar files, open all volumes to create a full  list  of  contained  files
              (default:  no).  If  disabled, only the archive entries whose headers are located within the first
              volume are listed (and thus played when opening a .rar file with mpv). Doing so speeds up opening,
              and the typical idiotic use-case of playing uncompressed multi-volume rar  files  that  contain  a
              single media file is made faster.

              Opening  is still slow, because for unknown, idiotic, and unnecessary reasons libarchive opens all
              volumes anyway when playing the main file, even though mpv iterated no archive entries yet.

       <b>--directory-mode=&lt;auto|lazy|recursive|ignore&gt;</b>
              When opening a directory, open subdirectories lazily, recursively or not at all.  The  default  is
              <b>auto</b>, which behaves like <b>recursive</b> with <b>--shuffle</b>, and like <b>lazy</b> otherwise.

       <b>--directory-filter-types=&lt;video,audio,image,archive,playlist&gt;</b>
              Media  file  types  to filter when opening directory. If the list is empty, all files are added to
              the playlist. (Default: <b>video,audio,image,archive,playlist</b>)

              This is a string list option. See List Options for details.

       <b>--autocreate-playlist=&lt;no|filter|same&gt;</b>
              When opening a local file, act as if  the  parent  directory  is  opened  and  create  a  playlist
              automatically.

              <b>no</b>     Load a single file (default).

              <b>filter</b> Create a playlist from the parent directory with files matching <b>--directory-filter-types</b>.

              <b>same</b>   Create  a  playlist  from the parent directory with files matching the same category as the
                     currently loaded file. One of the <b>*-exts</b> is selected based on the input file and only files
                     with matching extensions are added to the playlist.   If  the  input  file  itself  is  not
                     matched to any extension list, the playlist is not autogenerated.

   <b>Input</b>
       <b>--native-keyrepeat=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Use  system settings for keyrepeat delay and rate, instead of <b>--input-ar-delay</b> and <b>--input-ar-rate</b>
              (default: no).  Whether this applies depends on the VO backend and how it handles keyboard  input.
              Does not apply to terminal input.

       <b>--native-touch=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              (Windows  only)  For platforms which send emulated mouse inputs for touch-unaware clients, such as
              Windows, use system native touch events, instead  of  receiving  them  as  emulated  mouse  events
              (default: no). This is required for multi-touch support for these platforms.

              Note  that  this  option has no effect on other platforms: either native touch is not supported by
              mpv, or the platform does not give an option to receive emulated mouse inputs (so native touch  is
              always enabled, e.g. Wayland).

       <b>--input-ar-delay</b>
              Delay in milliseconds before we start to autorepeat a key (default: 200).  Set it to 0 to disable.

       <b>--input-ar-rate</b>
              Number of key presses to generate per second on autorepeat (default: 40).

       <b>--input-conf=&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Specify  input  configuration  file  other  than  the  default  location  in the mpv configuration
              directory (usually <b><a href="file:~/.config/mpv/input.conf">~/.config/mpv/input.conf</a></b>).

       <b>--input-default-bindings=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Enable default-level ("weak") key bindings (default: yes). These are bindings which  config  files
              like  <b>input.conf</b>  can  override.  It  currently  affects  the builtin key bindings, and keys which
              scripts bind using <b>mp.add_key_binding</b> (but not <b>mp.add_forced_key_binding</b>  because  this  overrides
              <b>input.conf</b>).

       <b>--input-builtin-bindings=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Enable  loading  of  built-in  key bindings during start-up (default: yes). This option is applied
              only during (lib)mpv initialization, and if disabled then it will not be not  possible  to  enable
              them later. May be useful to libmpv clients.

       <b>--input-builtin-dragging=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Enable  the  built-in  window-dragging  behavior  (default:  yes).  Setting  it to no disables the
              built-in dragging behavior. Note that unlike the <b>window-dragging</b> option, this option only  affects
              VOs  which support the <b>begin-vo-dragging</b> command, and does not disable window dragging initialized
              with the command.

       <b>--input-cmdlist</b>
              Prints all commands that can be bound to keys.

       <b>--input-commands=&lt;cmd1,cmd2,...&gt;</b>
              Define a list of commands for mpv to run. The syntax is the  same  as  format  as  <b>input.conf</b>  but
              without  the  key  binding  argument  at  the  beginning.  When this option is set at startup, the
              commands will run after audio and video playback are about to begin if applicable  (in  idle  mode
              with  no  file,  it will run immediately). When changing values at runtime, the commands will also
              run as soon as possible.

              This is a string list option. See List Options for details.

                 Example

                 <b>--input-commands="playlist-play-index</b> <b>1,set</b> <b>ao-volume</b> <b>40"</b>
                        sets the playlist index to 1 and the ao-volume to 40

       <b>--input-doubleclick-time=&lt;milliseconds&gt;</b>
              Time in milliseconds to recognize two consecutive button presses as a double-click (default: 300).

       <b>--input-keylist</b>
              Prints all keys that can be bound to commands.

       <b>--input-key-fifo-size=&lt;2-65000&gt;</b>
              Specify the size of the FIFO that buffers key events (default: 7). If it is too small, some events
              may be lost. The main disadvantage of setting it to a very large value is that if you hold down  a
              key  triggering  some  particularly  slow  command  then  the  player may be unresponsive while it
              processes all the queued commands.

       <b>--input-test</b>
              Input test mode. Instead of executing commands on key presses, mpv will  show  the  keys  and  the
              bound  commands  on  the  OSD.  Has to be used with a dummy video, and the normal ways to quit the
              player will not work (key bindings that normally quit will be shown on OSD  only,  just  like  any
              other binding). See INPUT.CONF.

       <b>--input-terminal=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              <b>--input-terminal=no</b>  prevents  the player from reading key events from standard input. Useful when
              reading data from standard input. This is automatically enabled when <b>-</b> is  found  on  the  command
              line.  There are situations where you have to set it manually, e.g. if you open <b><a href="file:/dev/stdin">/dev/stdin</a></b> (or the
              equivalent on your system), use stdin in a playlist or intend to read from stdin later on via  the
              loadfile or loadlist input commands.

       <b>--input-ipc-server=&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Enable the IPC support and create the listening socket at the given path.

              On  Linux and Unix, the given path is a regular filesystem path. On Windows, named pipes are used,
              so the path refers to the pipe namespace (<b>\\.\pipe\&lt;name&gt;</b>). If the <b>\\.\pipe\</b>  prefix  is  missing,
              mpv  will add it automatically before creating the pipe, so <b>--input-ipc-server=/tmp/mpv-socket</b> and
              <b>--input-ipc-server=\\.\pipe\tmp\mpv-socket</b> are equivalent for IPC on Windows.

              See JSON IPC for details.

       <b>--input-ipc-client=fd://&lt;N&gt;</b>
              Connect a single IPC client to the given FD.  This  is  somewhat  similar  to  <b>--input-ipc-server</b>,
              except  no  socket  is  created,  and  instead  the  passed FD is treated like a socket connection
              received from <b>accept()</b>. In practice, you could pass either a FD  created  by  <b>socketpair()</b>,  or  a
              pipe.   In both cases, you must make sure that the FD is actually inherited by mpv (do not set the
              POSIX <b>CLOEXEC</b> flag).

              The player quits when the connection is closed.

              This is somewhat similar to the removed <b>--input-file</b> option, except it supports only integer  FDs,
              and cannot open actual paths.

                 Example

                        <b>--input-ipc-client=fd://123</b>

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 To  use  this  option  on  Windows, the fd must refer to a wrapped (created by <b>_open_osfhandle</b>)
                 named pipe server handle with a client already connected. The named pipe must be created duplex
                 with overlapped IO and inheritable handles. The  program  communicates  with  mpv  through  the
                 client handle.

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 Writing  to the <b>input-ipc-server</b> option at runtime will start another instance of an IPC client
                 handler for the <b>input-ipc-client</b> option, because initialization is bundled, and this  thing  is
                 stupid.  This  is  a  bug. Writing to <b>input-ipc-client</b> at runtime will start another IPC client
                 handler for the new value, without stopping the old one, even if the FD value is the same  (but
                 the string is different e.g. due to whitespace). This is not a bug.

       <b>--input-gamepad=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Enable/disable SDL2 Gamepad support. Disabled by default.

       <b>--input-cursor=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Permit  mpv  to  receive  pointer events reported by the video output driver. Necessary to use the
              OSC. Support depends on the VO in use.

       <b>--input-cursor-passthrough=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Tell the backend windowing system to allow pointer events to  passthrough  the  mpv  window.  This
              allows windows under mpv to instead receive pointer events as if the mpv window was never there.

       <b>--input-media-keys=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              On  systems  where mpv can choose between receiving media keys or letting the system handle them -
              this option controls whether mpv should receive them.

              Default: yes (except for libmpv). macOS and Windows only, because elsewhere  mpv  doesn't  have  a
              choice  -  the  system decides whether to send media keys to mpv. For instance, on X11 or Wayland,
              system-wide media keys are not implemented. Whether media keys work when the mpv window is focused
              is implementation-defined.

       <b>--input-preprocess-wheel=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Preprocess <b>WHEEL_*</b> events so that while scrolling on the horizontal  or  vertical  direction,  the
              events  aren't  generated for another direction even when the two directions are scrolled together
              (default: yes).

              This preprocessing can be beneficial for preventing accidentally seeking while changing the volume
              by scrolling on a touchpad with the default keybind. Due to the deadzone mechanism used, disabling
              the preprocessing allows for diagonal scrolling (such as panning) and  potentially  reduces  input
              latency.

              Note  that  disabling the preprocessing does not affect any filtering done by the OS/driver before
              these events are delivered to mpv, if any.

       <b>--input-right-alt-gr=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              (macOS and Windows only) Use the right Alt key  as  Alt  Gr  to  produce  special  characters.  If
              disabled, count the right Alt as an Alt modifier key. Enabled by default.

       <b>--input-vo-keyboard=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Disable  all  keyboard  input  on  for  VOs  which  can't  participate  in  proper  keyboard input
              dispatching. May not affect all VOs. Generally useful for embedding only.

              On X11, a sub-window with input enabled grabs all keyboard input as long as it is 1. a child of  a
              focused window, and 2. the mouse is inside of the sub-window. It can steal away all keyboard input
              from  the application embedding the mpv window, and on the other hand, the mpv window will receive
              no input if the mouse is outside of the mpv window, even though mpv  has  focus.  Modern  toolkits
              work around this weird X11 behavior, but naively embedding foreign windows breaks it.

              The  only  way to handle this reasonably is using the XEmbed protocol, which was designed to solve
              these problems. GTK provides <b>GtkSocket</b>, which supports XEmbed. Qt doesn't seem to provide anything
              working in newer versions.

              If the embedder supports XEmbed, input should work with default  settings  and  with  this  option
              disabled. Note that <b>input-default-bindings</b> is disabled by default in libmpv as well - it should be
              enabled if you want the mpv default key bindings.

       <b>--input-touch-emulate-mouse=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              When   multi-touch   support   is  enabled  (either  required  by  the  platform,  or  enabled  by
              <b>--native-touch</b>), emulate mouse move and button presses for the touch events (default:  yes).  This
              is  useful  for  compatibility  for  mouse key bindings and scripts which read mouse positions for
              platforms which do not support <b>--native-touch=no</b> (e.g. Wayland).

       <b>--input-dragging-deadzone=&lt;N&gt;</b>
              Begin the built-in window dragging when the mouse moves outside a deadzone of <b>N</b> pixels  while  the
              mouse  button  is  being  held  down  (default:  3).  This  only  affects  VOs  which  support the
              <b>begin-vo-dragging</b> command.

       <b>--input-ime=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Enable keyboard input via an active input method (IME) connected to the VO.   (default:  no).  The
              input  popup  window, if there is any, is always positioned at the top left of the window. Whether
              pre-edit text is drawn depends on the platform. You may need to configure your IME to display  the
              pre-edit inside of the input popup window if you cannot read the pre-edit text in the mpv window.

              Wayland and Windows only. This option is not applicable to terminal input.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Enabling  IME  can  cause problems with key bindings, because mpv cannot detect any key presses
                 when they go into the IME pre-edit area.  It is recommended to enable IME on  demand  only  for
                 the duration while text input is expected.

                 The builtin console and input selector enable IME for the duration of accepting text input.

   <b>OSD</b>
       <b>--osc=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Whether to load the on-screen-controller (default: yes).

       <b>--osd-bar=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Enable display of the OSD bar (default: yes).

              You can configure this on a per-command basis in input.conf using <b>osd-</b> prefixes, see <b>Input</b> <b>Command</b>
              <b>Prefixes</b>. If you want to disable the OSD completely, use <b>--osd-level=0</b>.

       <b>--osd-on-seek=&lt;no,bar,msg,msg-bar&gt;</b>
              Set what is displayed on the OSD during seeks. The default is <b>bar</b>.

              You can configure this on a per-command basis in input.conf using <b>osd-</b> prefixes, see <b>Input</b> <b>Command</b>
              <b>Prefixes</b>.

       <b>--osd-duration=&lt;time&gt;</b>
              Set the duration of the OSD messages in ms (default: 1000).

       <b>--osd-font=&lt;name&gt;</b>
              Specify font to use for OSD. The default is <b>sans-serif</b>.

                 Examples

                 • <b>--osd-font='Bitstream</b> <b>Vera</b> <b>Sans'</b>

                 • <b>--osd-font='Comic</b> <b>Sans</b> <b>MS'</b>

       <b>--osd-font-size=&lt;size&gt;</b>
              Specify the OSD font size. See <b>--sub-font-size</b> for details.

              Default: 30

       <b>--osd-msg1=&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Show  this  string  as  message on OSD with OSD level 1 (visible by default).  The message will be
              visible by default, and as long as no other message covers it, and the  OSD  level  isn't  changed
              (see <b>--osd-level</b>).  Expands properties; see Property Expansion.

       <b>--osd-msg2=&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Similar  to  <b>--osd-msg1</b>,  but  for  OSD  level  2.  If this is an empty string (default), then the
              playback time is shown.

       <b>--osd-msg3=&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Similar to <b>--osd-msg1</b>, but for OSD level 3. If  this  is  an  empty  string  (default),  then  the
              playback time, duration, and some more information is shown.

              This  is  used for the <b>show-progress</b> command (by default mapped to <b>P</b>), and when seeking if enabled
              with <b>--osd-on-seek</b> or by <b>osd-</b> prefixes in input.conf (see <b>Input</b> <b>Command</b> <b>Prefixes</b>).

              <b>--osd-status-msg</b> is a legacy equivalent (but with a minor difference).

       <b>--osd-status-msg=&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Show a custom string during playback instead of the standard  status  text.   This  overrides  the
              status text used for <b>--osd-level=3</b>, when using the <b>show-progress</b> command (by default mapped to <b>P</b>),
              and  when  seeking if enabled with <b>--osd-on-seek</b> or <b>osd-</b> prefixes in input.conf (see <b>Input</b> <b>Command</b>
              <b>Prefixes</b>). Expands properties. See Property Expansion.

              This option has been replaced with <b>--osd-msg3</b>. The only difference is that this option  implicitly
              includes <b>${osd-sym-cc}</b>. This option is ignored if <b>--osd-msg3</b> is not empty.

       <b>--osd-playing-msg=&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Show  a  message  on  OSD  when  playback  starts.  The  string  is  expanded for properties, e.g.
              <b>--osd-playing-msg='file:</b> <b>${filename}'</b> will show the message <b>file:</b> followed  by  a  space  and  the
              currently played filename.

              See Property Expansion.

       <b>--osd-playing-msg-duration=&lt;time&gt;</b>
              Set  the  duration of <b>osd-playing-msg</b> in ms. If this is unset, <b>osd-playing-msg</b> stays on screen for
              the duration of <b>osd-duration</b>.

       <b>--osd-playlist-entry=&lt;title|filename|both&gt;</b>
              Whether to display the media title, filename, or both. If the <b>media-title</b>  is  not  available,  it
              will display only the <b>filename</b>.

              Default: <b>title</b>.

       <b>--osd-bar-align-x=&lt;-1-1&gt;</b>
              Position  of  the OSD bar. -1 is far left, 0 is centered, 1 is far right.  Fractional values (like
              0.5) are allowed.

       <b>--osd-bar-align-y=&lt;-1-1&gt;</b>
              Position of the OSD bar. -1 is top, 0 is centered, 1 is bottom.  Fractional values (like 0.5)  are
              allowed.

       <b>--osd-bar-w=&lt;1-100&gt;</b>
              Width  of  the  OSD bar, in percentage of the screen width (default: 75).  A value of 50 means the
              bar is half the screen wide.

       <b>--osd-bar-h=&lt;0.1-50&gt;</b>
              Height of the OSD bar, in percentage of the screen height (default: 3.125).

       <b>--osd-bar-outline-size=&lt;size&gt;</b>
              Size of the outline of the OSD bar in scaled pixels (see <b>--sub-font-size</b> for details).

              <b>--osd-bar-border-size</b> is an alias for <b>--osd-bar-outline-size</b>.

              Default: 0.5.

       <b>--osd-bar-marker-scale=&lt;0-100&gt;</b>
              Factor for the OSD bar marker size relative to the OSD bar outline size.

              Default: 1.3.

       <b>--osd-bar-marker-min-size=&lt;size&gt;</b>
              Minimum OSD bar marker size.

              Default: 1.6.

       <b>--osd-bar-marker-style=&lt;none|triangle|line&gt;</b>
              Set the OSD bar marker style.

              <b>none</b>   Don't draw markers.

              <b>triangle</b>
                     Draw markers as triangles (default).

              <b>line</b>   Draw markers as lines.

       <b>--osd-blur=&lt;0..20.0&gt;</b>
              Gaussian blur factor applied to the OSD font border.  0 means no blur applied (default).

       <b>--osd-bold=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Format text on bold.

       <b>--osd-italic=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Format text on italic.

       <b>--osd-outline-color=&lt;color&gt;</b>
              See <b>--sub-color</b>. Color used for the OSD font outline.

              <b>--osd-border-color</b> is an alias for <b>--osd-outline-color</b>.

       <b>--osd-back-color=&lt;color&gt;</b>
              See <b>--sub-color</b>. Color used for OSD text background.

              <b>--osd-shadow-color</b> is an alias for <b>--osd-back-color</b>.

       <b>--osd-outline-size=&lt;size&gt;</b>
              Size of the OSD font outline in scaled pixels (see <b>--sub-font-size</b> for  details).  A  value  of  0
              disables outlines.

              <b>--osd-border-size</b> is an alias for <b>--osd-outline-size</b>.

              Default: 1.65

       <b>--osd-border-style=&lt;outline-and-shadow|opaque-box|background-box&gt;</b>
              See <b>--sub-border-style</b>. Style used for OSD text border.

       <b>--osd-color=&lt;color&gt;</b>
              Specify the color used for OSD.  See <b>--sub-color</b> for details.

       <b>--osd-selected-color=&lt;color&gt;</b>
              The color of the selected item in lists.  See <b>--sub-color</b> for details.

       <b>--osd-selected-outline-color=&lt;color&gt;</b>
              The outline color of the selected item in lists.  See <b>--sub-color</b> for details.

       <b>--osd-fractions</b>
              Show  OSD  times  with  fractions  of  seconds (in millisecond precision). Useful to see the exact
              timestamp of a video frame.

       <b>--osd-level=&lt;0-3&gt;</b>
              Specifies which mode the OSD should start in.

              <b>0</b>      OSD completely disabled (subtitles only)

              <b>1</b>      enabled (shows up only on user interaction)

              <b>2</b>      enabled + current time visible by default

              <b>3</b>      enabled + <b>--osd-status-msg</b> (current time and status by default)

       <b>--osd-margin-x=&lt;size&gt;</b>
              Left and right screen margin for the OSD in scaled pixels (see <b>--sub-font-size</b> for details).

              This option specifies the distance of the OSD to the left, as well as at which distance  from  the
              right border long OSD text will be broken.

              Default: 16

       <b>--osd-margin-y=&lt;size&gt;</b>
              Top and bottom screen margin for the OSD in scaled pixels (see <b>--sub-font-size</b> for details).

              This option specifies the vertical margins of the OSD.

              Default: 16

       <b>--osd-align-x=&lt;left|center|right&gt;</b>
              Control to which corner of the screen OSD should be aligned to (default: <b>left</b>).

       <b>--osd-align-y=&lt;top|center|bottom&gt;</b>
              Vertical position (default: <b>top</b>).  Details see <b>--osd-align-x</b>.

       <b>--osd-scale=&lt;factor&gt;</b>
              OSD font size multiplier, multiplied with <b>--osd-font-size</b> value.

       <b>--osd-scale-by-window=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Whether to scale the OSD with the window size (default: yes). If this is disabled, <b>--osd-font-size</b>
              and  other  OSD  options  that  use  scaled pixels are always in actual pixels. The effect is that
              changing the window size won't change the OSD font size.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 For scripts which draw user interface elements, it is recommended to respect the value of  this
                 option when deciding whether the elements are scaled with window size or not.

       <b>--osd-shadow-offset=&lt;size&gt;</b>
              Displacement  of  the  OSD shadow in scaled pixels (see <b>--sub-font-size</b> for details). A value of 0
              disables shadows.

              Default: 0.

       <b>--osd-spacing=&lt;size&gt;</b>
              Horizontal OSD/sub font spacing in scaled pixels (see <b>--sub-font-size</b> for details). This value  is
              added to the normal letter spacing. Negative values are allowed.

              Default: 0.

       <b>--video-osd=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Enabled  OSD  rendering  on  the video window (default: yes). This can be used in situations where
              terminal OSD is preferred. If you just want to disable all OSD rendering, use <b>--osd-level=0</b>.

              It does not affect subtitles or overlays created by scripts (in particular, the OSC  needs  to  be
              disabled with <b>--osc=no</b>).

              This option is somewhat experimental and could be replaced by another mechanism in the future.

       <b>--osd-font-provider=&lt;...&gt;</b>
              See  <b>--sub-font-provider</b>  for  details  and accepted values. Note that unlike subtitles, OSD never
              uses embedded fonts from media files.

       <b>--osd-fonts-dir=&lt;path&gt;</b>
              See <b>--sub-fonts-dir</b> for details.  Defaults to <b>~<a href="file:~/fonts">~/fonts</a></b>.

   <b>Screenshot</b>
       <b>--screenshot-format=&lt;type&gt;</b>
              Set the image file type used for saving screenshots.

              Available choices:

              <b>png</b>    PNG

              <b>jpg</b>    JPEG (default)

              <b>jpeg</b>   JPEG (alias for jpg)

              <b>webp</b>   WebP

              <b>jxl</b>    JPEG XL

              <b>avif</b>   AVIF

       <b>--screenshot-tag-colorspace=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Tag screenshots with the appropriate colorspace (default: yes).

              Note that not all formats support this. When it is unsupported, or when this option  is  disabled,
              screenshots will be converted to sRGB before being written.

       <b>--screenshot-high-bit-depth=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              If  possible,  write screenshots with a bit depth similar to the source video (default: yes). This
              is interesting in particular for PNG, as this sometimes triggers writing 16  bit  PNGs  with  huge
              file  sizes.  This  will  also include an unused alpha channel in the resulting files if 16 bit is
              used.

       <b>--screenshot-template=&lt;template&gt;</b>
              Specify the filename template used to  save  screenshots.  The  template  specifies  the  filename
              without file extension, and can contain format specifiers, which will be substituted when taking a
              screenshot.    By   default,   the  template  is  <b>mpv-shot%n</b>,  which  results  in  filenames  like
              <b>mpv-shot0012.png</b> for example.

              The template can start with a relative or absolute path, in order to specify a directory  location
              where screenshots should be saved.

              If  the  final  screenshot  filename  points  to  an  already  existing file, the file will not be
              overwritten. The screenshot will either not be saved, or if the template contains <b>%n</b>, saved  using
              different, newly generated filename.

              Allowed format specifiers:

              <b>%[#][0X]n</b>
                     A  sequence  number,  padded with zeros to length X (default: 04). E.g.  passing the format
                     <b>%04n</b> will yield <b>0012</b> on the 12th screenshot.   The  number  is  incremented  every  time  a
                     screenshot  is  taken or if the file already exists. The length <b>X</b> must be in the range 0-9.
                     With the optional # sign, mpv will use the lowest available number.  For  example,  if  you
                     take  three  screenshots--0001,  0002,  0003--and  delete  the  first  two,  the  next  two
                     screenshots will not be 0004 and 0005, but 0001 and 0002 again.

              <b>%f</b>     Filename of the currently played video.

              <b>%F</b>     Same as <b>%f</b>, but strip the file extension, including the dot.

              <b>%x</b>     Directory path of the currently played video. If the video is not on  the  filesystem  (but
                     e.g. <b>http://</b>), this expand to an empty string.

              <b>%X{fallback}</b>
                     Same  as  <b>%x</b>,  but  if  the video file is not on the filesystem, return the fallback string
                     inside the <b>{...}</b>.

              <b>%p</b>     Current playback time, in the same format as used in the OSD. The result is a string of the
                     form "HH:MM:SS". For example, if the video is  at  the  time  position  5  minutes  and  34
                     seconds, <b>%p</b> will be replaced with "00:05:34".

              <b>%P</b>     Similar  to  <b>%p</b>,  but  extended with the playback time in milliseconds.  It is formatted as
                     "HH:MM:SS.mmm", with "mmm" being the millisecond part of the playback time.

                     <b>NOTE:</b>
                        This is a simple way for getting unique per-frame timestamps. (Frame  numbers  would  be
                        more  intuitive,  but are not easily implementable because container formats usually use
                        time stamps for identifying frames.)

              <b>%wX</b>    Specify the current playback time using the format string <b>X</b>.  <b>%p</b> is like  <b>%wH:%wM:%wS</b>,  and
                     <b>%P</b> is like <b>%wH:%wM:%wS.%wT</b>.

                     <b>Valid</b> <b>format</b> <b>specifiers:</b>

                            <b>%wH</b>    hour (padded with 0 to two digits)

                            <b>%wh</b>    hour (not padded)

                            <b>%wM</b>    minutes (00-59)

                            <b>%wm</b>    total minutes (includes hours, unlike <b>%wM</b>)

                            <b>%wS</b>    seconds (00-59)

                            <b>%ws</b>    total seconds (includes hours and minutes)

                            <b>%wf</b>    like <b>%ws</b>, but as float

                            <b>%wT</b>    milliseconds (000-999)

              <b>%tX</b>    Specify the current local date/time using the format <b>X</b>. This format specifier uses the UNIX
                     <b>strftime()</b>  function  internally,  and  inserts the result of passing "%X" to <b>strftime</b>. For
                     example, <b>%tm</b> will insert the number of the  current  month  as  number.  You  have  to  use
                     multiple <b>%tX</b> specifiers to build a full date/time string.

              <b>%{prop[:fallback</b> <b>text]}</b>
                     Insert  the  value of the input property 'prop'. E.g. <b>%{filename}</b> is the same as <b>%f</b>. If the
                     property does not exist or is not available, an error text is inserted, unless  a  fallback
                     is specified.

              <b>%%</b>     Replaced with the <b>%</b> character itself.

       <b>--screenshot-dir=&lt;path&gt;</b>
              Store  screenshots  in  this  directory.  This  path  is  joined  with  the  filename generated by
              <b>--screenshot-template</b>. If the template filename is already absolute, the directory is ignored.

              <b>--screenshot-directory</b> is an alias for <b>--screenshot-dir</b>.

              If the directory does not exist, it is created on the first screenshot. If it is not a  directory,
              an error is generated when trying to write a screenshot.

              This option is not set by default, and thus will write screenshots to the directory from which mpv
              was started. In pseudo-gui mode (see PSEUDO GUI MODE), this is set to the desktop.

       <b>--screenshot-jpeg-quality=&lt;0-100&gt;</b>
              Set the JPEG quality level. Higher means better quality. The default is 90.

       <b>--screenshot-jpeg-source-chroma=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Write  JPEG  files  with the same chroma subsampling as the video (default: yes). If disabled, the
              libjpeg default is used.

       <b>--screenshot-png-compression=&lt;0-9&gt;</b>
              Set the PNG compression level. Higher means better compression. This will affect the file size  of
              the  written  screenshot  file  and  the time it takes to write a screenshot. Too high compression
              might occupy enough CPU time to interrupt playback. The default is 7.

       <b>--screenshot-png-filter=&lt;0-5&gt;</b>
              Set the filter applied prior to PNG compression. 0 is none, 1 is "sub", 2 is "up", 3 is "average",
              4 is "Paeth", and 5 is "mixed". This affects the level of compression that can  be  achieved.  For
              most images, "mixed" achieves the best compression ratio, hence it is the default.

       <b>--screenshot-webp-lossless=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Write lossless WebP files. <b>--screenshot-webp-quality</b> is ignored if this is set. The default is no.

       <b>--screenshot-webp-quality=&lt;0-100&gt;</b>
              Set the WebP quality level. Higher means better quality. The default is 75.

       <b>--screenshot-webp-compression=&lt;0-6&gt;</b>
              Set  the  WebP  compression  level. Higher means better compression, but takes more CPU time. Note
              that this also affects the screenshot quality when used with lossy WebP files. The default is 4.

       <b>--screenshot-jxl-distance=&lt;0-15&gt;</b>
              Set the JPEG XL Butteraugli distance. Lower means better quality. Lossless  is  0.0,  and  1.0  is
              approximately  equivalent  to  JPEG  quality  90  for  photographic content. Use 0.1 for "visually
              lossless" screenshots. The default is 1.0.

       <b>--screenshot-jxl-effort=&lt;1-9&gt;</b>
              Set the JPEG XL compression effort. Higher effort (usually) means better  compression,  but  takes
              more CPU time. The default is 4.

       <b>--screenshot-avif-encoder=&lt;encoder&gt;</b>
              Specify the AV1 encoder to be used by libavcodec for encoding avif screenshots.

              Default: <b>libaom-av1</b>

       <b>--screenshot-avif-pixfmt=&lt;format&gt;</b>
              Specify  the  pixel  format for the libavcodec encoder. Defaults to empty, which lets mpv pick one
              close to the source format.

       <b>--screenshot-avif-opts=key1=value1,key2=value2,...</b>
              Specifies libavcodec options for selected  encoder.  For  more  information,  consult  the  FFmpeg
              documentation.

              Default: <b>usage=allintra,crf=0,cpu-used=8</b>

              Note:  the  default is only guaranteed to work with the libaom-av1 encoder.  Above options may not
              be valid and or optimal for other encoders.

              This is a key/value list option. See List Options for details.

                 Example

                 <b>"--screenshot-avif-opts=crf=23,aq-mode=complexity"</b>
                        sets the crf to 23 and quantization (aq-mode) to complexity based.

       <b>--screenshot-sw=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Whether to use software rendering for screenshots (default: no).

              If set to no, the screenshot will be rendered by  the  current  VO  (only  vo_gpu  or  vo_gpu_next
              currently).  The  advantage  is  that  this will (probably) always show up as in the video window,
              because the same code is used for rendering.  But since the renderer needs  to  be  reinitialized,
              this can be slow and interrupt playback.

              If  set  to  yes,  the software scaler is used to convert the video to RGB (or whatever the target
              screenshot requires). In this case, conversion will run in a separate thread and will probably not
              interrupt playback. The software renderer may lack some capabilities, such as HDR  rendering.   If
              <b>window</b>  mode  is  used, the image will also be scaled in software which may not accurately reflect
              the actual visible result.

   <b>Software</b> <b>Scaler</b>
       <b>--sws-scaler=&lt;name&gt;</b>
              Specify the software scaler algorithm to be used with <b>--vf=scale</b>. This also affects  video  output
              drivers which lack hardware acceleration, e.g. <b>x11</b>. See also <b>--vf=scale</b>.

              To get a list of available scalers, run <b>--sws-scaler=help</b>.

              Default: <b>bicubic</b>.

       <b>--sws-lgb=&lt;0-100&gt;</b>
              Software scaler Gaussian blur filter (luma). See <b>--sws-scaler</b>.

       <b>--sws-cgb=&lt;0-100&gt;</b>
              Software scaler Gaussian blur filter (chroma). See <b>--sws-scaler</b>.

       <b>--sws-ls=&lt;-100-100&gt;</b>
              Software scaler sharpen filter (luma). See <b>--sws-scaler</b>.

       <b>--sws-cs=&lt;-100-100&gt;</b>
              Software scaler sharpen filter (chroma). See <b>--sws-scaler</b>.

       <b>--sws-chs=&lt;h&gt;</b>
              Software scaler chroma horizontal shifting. See <b>--sws-scaler</b>.

       <b>--sws-cvs=&lt;v&gt;</b>
              Software scaler chroma vertical shifting. See <b>--sws-scaler</b>.

       <b>--sws-bitexact=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Unknown  functionality (default: no). Consult libswscale source code. The primary purpose of this,
              as far as libswscale API goes), is to produce exactly the same output for the same  input  on  all
              platforms   (output   has  the  same  "bits"  everywhere,  thus  "bitexact").  Typically  disables
              optimizations.

       <b>--sws-fast=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Allow optimizations that help with performance, but reduce quality (default: no).

              VOs like <b>drm</b> and <b>x11</b> will benefit a lot from using <b>--sws-fast</b>.  You may need to set other options,
              like <b>--sws-scaler</b>. The builtin  <b>sws-fast</b>  profile  sets  this  option  and  some  others  to  gain
              performance for reduced quality. Also see <b>--sws-allow-zimg</b>.

       <b>--sws-allow-zimg=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Allow  using  zimg  (if  the  component  using  the internal swscale wrapper explicitly allows so)
              (default: yes). In this case, zimg <u>may</u> be used, if the internal zimg wrapper  supports  the  input
              and output formats. It will silently or noisily fall back to libswscale if one of these conditions
              does not apply.

              If zimg is used, the other <b>--sws-</b> options are ignored, and the <b>--zimg-</b> options are used instead.

              If the internal component using the swscale wrapper hooks up logging correctly, a verbose priority
              log message will indicate whether zimg is being used.

              Most things which need software conversion can make use of this.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Do  note  that  zimg  <u>may</u> be slower than libswscale. Usually, it's faster on x86 platforms, but
                 slower on ARM (due  to  lack  of  ARM  specific  optimizations).  The  mpv  zimg  wrapper  uses
                 unoptimized repacking for some formats, for which zimg cannot be blamed.

       <b>--zimg-scaler=&lt;point|bilinear|bicubic|spline16|spline36|lanczos&gt;</b>
              Zimg luma scaler to use (default: lanczos).

       <b>--zimg-scaler-param-a=&lt;default|float&gt;,</b> <b>--zimg-scaler-param-b=&lt;default|float&gt;</b>
              Set  scaler  parameters.  By default, these are set to the special string <b>default</b>, which maps to a
              scaler-specific default value. Ignored if the scaler is not tunable.

              <b>lanczos</b>
                     <b>--zimg-scaler-param-a</b> is the number of taps.

              <b>bicubic</b>
                     a and b are the bicubic b and c parameters.

       <b>--zimg-scaler-chroma=...</b>
              Same as <b>--zimg-scaler</b>, for for chroma interpolation (default: bilinear).

       <b>--zimg-scaler-chroma-param-a,</b> <b>--zimg-scaler-chroma-param-b</b>
              Same as <b>--zimg-scaler-param-a</b> / <b>--zimg-scaler-param-b</b>, for chroma.

       <b>--zimg-dither=&lt;no|ordered|random|error-diffusion&gt;</b>
              Dithering (default: random).

       <b>--zimg-threads=&lt;auto|integer&gt;</b>
              Set the maximum number of threads to use for scaling (default: auto).  <b>auto</b>  uses  the  number  of
              logical  cores  on  the current machine. Note that the scaler may use less threads (or even just 1
              thread) depending on stuff.  Passing a value of 1 disables threading and always scales  the  image
              in a single operation. Higher thread counts waste resources, but make it typically faster.

              Note that some zimg git versions had bugs that will corrupt the output if threads are used.

       <b>--zimg-fast=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Allow optimizations that help with performance, but reduce quality (default: yes). Currently, this
              may simplify gamma conversion operations.

   <b>Audio</b> <b>Resampler</b>
       This  controls  the default options of any resampling done by mpv (but not within libavfilter, within the
       system audio API resampler, or any other places).

       <b>--audio-resample-filter-size=&lt;length&gt;</b>
              Length of the filter with respect to the lower sampling rate. (default: 16)

       <b>--audio-resample-phase-shift=&lt;count&gt;</b>
              Log2 of the number of polyphase  entries.  (...,  10-&gt;1024,  11-&gt;2048,  12-&gt;4096,  ...)  (default:
              10-&gt;1024)

       <b>--audio-resample-cutoff=&lt;cutoff&gt;</b>
              Cutoff frequency (0.0-1.0), default set depending upon filter length.

       <b>--audio-resample-linear=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              If set then filters will be linearly interpolated between polyphase entries. (default: no)

       <b>--audio-normalize-downmix=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Enable/disable  normalization  if  surround audio is downmixed to stereo (default: no). If this is
              disabled, downmix can cause clipping. If it's enabled, the output might be too quiet.  It  depends
              on the source audio.

              If  downmix  happens outside of mpv for some reason, or in the decoder (decoder downmixing), or in
              the audio output (system mixer), this has no effect.

       <b>--audio-resample-max-output-size=&lt;length&gt;</b>
              Limit maximum size of audio frames filtered at once, in ms (default: 40).  The output size size is
              limited in order to make resample speed changes react faster.  This  is  necessary  especially  if
              decoders or filters output very large frame sizes (like some lossless codecs or some DRC filters).
              This option does not affect the resampling algorithm in any way.

              For testing/debugging only. Can be removed or changed any time.

       <b>--audio-swresample-o=&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Set AVOptions on the SwrContext or AVAudioResampleContext. These should be documented by FFmpeg.

              This is a key/value list option. See List Options for details.

   <b>Terminal</b>
       <b>--quiet</b>
              Make  console  output  less  verbose;  in  particular,  prevents  the  status  line  (i.e. AV: 3.4
              (00:00:03.37) / 5320.6 ...) from being displayed.  Particularly useful on slow terminals or broken
              ones which do not properly handle carriage return (i.e. <b>\r</b>).

              See also: <b>--really-quiet</b> and <b>--msg-level</b>.

       <b>--really-quiet</b>
              Display even less output and status messages than with <b>--quiet</b>.

       <b>--terminal=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              <b>--terminal=no</b> disables any use of the terminal and stdin/stdout/stderr.  This completely  silences
              any message output.

              Unlike <b>--really-quiet</b>, this disables input and terminal initialization as well.

       <b>--msg-color=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Enable colorful console output on terminals (default: yes).

       <b>--msg-level=&lt;module1=level1,module2=level2,...&gt;</b>
              Control  verbosity  directly  for  each  module.  The  <b>all</b> module changes the verbosity of all the
              modules. The verbosity changes from this option are applied in order from left to right, and  each
              item can override a previous one.

              Run  mpv  with <b>--msg-level=all=trace</b> to see all messages mpv outputs. You can use the module names
              printed in the output (prefixed to each line in <b>[...]</b>) to limit the output to interesting modules.

              This also affects <b>--log-file</b>, and in certain cases libmpv API logging.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Some messages are printed before the command line is parsed and are therefore not  affected  by
                 <b>--msg-level</b>.  To  control these messages, you have to use the <b>MPV_VERBOSE</b> environment variable;
                 see ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES for details.

              Available levels:

                 <b>no</b>     complete silence

                 <b>fatal</b>  fatal messages only

                 <b>error</b>  error messages

                 <b>warn</b>   warning messages

                 <b>info</b>   informational messages

                 <b>status</b> status messages (default)

                 <b>v</b>      verbose messages

                 <b>debug</b>  debug messages

                 <b>trace</b>  very noisy debug messages

                 Example

                     mpv --msg-level=ao/sndio=no

                 Completely silences the output of ao_sndio, which uses the log prefix <b>[ao/sndio]</b>.

                     mpv --msg-level=all=warn,ao/alsa=error

                 Only show warnings or worse, and let the ao_alsa output show errors only.

       <b>--term-osd=&lt;auto|no|force&gt;</b>
              Control whether OSD messages are shown on the console when no video output is available  (default:
              auto).

              <b>auto</b>   use terminal OSD if no video output active

              <b>no</b>     disable terminal OSD

              <b>force</b>  use terminal OSD even if video output active

              The <b>auto</b> mode also enables terminal OSD if <b>--video-osd=no</b> was set.

       <b>--term-osd-bar=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Enable printing a progress bar under the status line on the terminal.  (Disabled by default.)

       <b>--term-osd-bar-chars=&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Customize  the  <b>--term-osd-bar</b>  feature. The string is expected to consist of 5 characters (start,
              left space, position indicator, right space, end). You can use Unicode characters, but  note  that
              double- width characters will not be treated correctly.

              Default: <b>[-+-]</b>.

       <b>--term-playing-msg=&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Print  out  a  string  after  starting  playback.  The  string  is  expanded  for properties, e.g.
              <b>--term-playing-msg='file:</b> <b>${filename}'</b> will print the string <b>file:</b> followed by  a  space  and  the
              currently played filename.

              See Property Expansion.

       <b>--term-status-msg=&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Print out a custom string during playback instead of the standard status line. Expands properties.
              See Property Expansion.

       <b>--term-title=&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Set the terminal title. Currently, this simply concatenates the escape sequence setting the window
              title  with  the  provided  (property  expanded)  string. This will mess up if the expanded string
              contain bytes that end the escape sequence, or if the terminal does not understand  the  sequence.
              The latter probably includes the regrettable win32.

              Expands properties. See Property Expansion.

       <b>--msg-module</b>
              Prepend module name to each console message.

       <b>--msg-time</b>
              Prepend  timing  information  to  each  console  message.  The time is in seconds since the player
              process was started  (technically,  slightly  later  actually),  using  a  monotonic  time  source
              depending on the OS. This is <b>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</b> on sane UNIX variants.

   <b>Cache</b>
       <b>--cache=&lt;yes|no|auto&gt;</b>
              Decide whether to use network cache settings (default: auto).

              If  enabled, use up to <b>--cache-secs</b> for the cache size (but still limited to <b>--demuxer-max-bytes</b>),
              and make the cached data seekable (if possible).   If  disabled,  <b>--cache-pause</b>  and  related  are
              implicitly disabled.

              The  <b>auto</b>  choice  enables  this  depending  on  whether  the stream is thought to involve network
              accesses or other slow media (this is an imperfect heuristic).

              Before mpv 0.30.0, this used to accept a  number,  which  specified  the  size  of  the  cache  in
              kilobytes. Use e.g. <b>--cache</b> <b>--demuxer-max-bytes=123k</b> instead.

       <b>--cache-secs=&lt;seconds&gt;</b>
              How  many  seconds  of  audio/video  to  prefetch  if  the  cache  is  active.  This overrides the
              <b>--demuxer-readahead-secs</b> option if and only if the cache is enabled and the value is  larger.  The
              default  value  is  set to something very high, so the actually achieved readahead will usually be
              limited by the value of the <b>--demuxer-max-bytes</b> option. Setting this option is usually only useful
              for limiting readahead.

       <b>--cache-on-disk=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Write packet data to a temporary file, instead of keeping them in memory.  This makes  sense  only
              with <b>--cache</b>. If the normal cache is disabled, this option is ignored.

              The  cache  file is append-only. Even if the player appears to prune data, the file space freed by
              it is not reused. The cache file is deleted when playback is closed.

              Note that packet metadata is still kept in memory. <b>--demuxer-max-bytes</b>  and  related  options  are
              applied  to  metadata  <u>only</u>.  The  size  of  this metadata  varies, but 50 MB per hour of media is
              typical. The cache statistics will report this metadats size, instead of the  size  of  the  cache
              file. If the metadata hits the size limits, the metadata is pruned (but not the cache file).

              When the media is closed, the cache file is deleted. A cache file is generally worthless after the
              media is closed, and it's hard to retrieve any media data from it (it's not supported by design).

              If  the  option  is enabled at runtime, the cache file is created, but old data will remain in the
              memory cache. If the option is disabled at runtime, old data remains in the disk  cache,  and  the
              cache  file  is not closed until the media is closed. If the option is disabled and enabled again,
              it will continue to use the cache file that was opened first.

       <b>--demuxer-cache-dir=&lt;path&gt;</b>
              Directory where to create temporary files.  Cache  is  stored  in  the  system's  cache  directory
              (usually <b><a href="file:~/.cache/mpv">~/.cache/mpv</a></b>) if this is unset.

              Currently, this is used for <b>--cache-on-disk</b> only.

       <b>--cache-pause=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Whether  the  player  should  automatically  pause  when  the  cache  runs  out of data and stalls
              decoding/playback (default: yes). If enabled,  it  will  pause  and  unpause  once  more  data  is
              available, aka "buffering".

       <b>--cache-pause-wait=&lt;seconds&gt;</b>
              Number  of  seconds  the  packet  cache  should  have  buffered  before starting playback again if
              "buffering" was entered (default: 1). This can be used to control how long the player rebuffers if
              <b>--cache-pause</b> is enabled, and the demuxer underruns. If the given time is higher than the  maximum
              set with <b>--cache-secs</b> or  <b>--demuxer-readahead-secs</b>, or prefetching ends before that for some other
              reason (like file end or maximum configured cache size reached), playback resumes earlier.

       <b>--cache-pause-initial=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Enter "buffering" mode before starting playback (default: no). This can be used to ensure playback
              starts  smoothly,  in  exchange  for  waiting some time to prefetch network data (as controlled by
              <b>--cache-pause-wait</b>). For example, some common behavior is that playback starts, but network caches
              immediately underrun when trying to decode more data as playback progresses.

              Another thing that can happen is that the network prefetching is so CPU demanding (due to demuxing
              in the background) that playback drops frames at first. In these cases,  it  helps  enabling  this
              option, and setting <b>--cache-secs</b> and <b>--cache-pause-wait</b> to roughly the same value.

              This option also triggers when playback is restarted after seeking.

       <b>--demuxer-cache-unlink-files=&lt;immediate|whendone|no&gt;</b>
              Whether  or  when  to  unlink cache files (default: immediate). This affects cache files which are
              inherently temporary, and which make no sense to remain on disk after the player terminates.  This
              is a debugging option.

              <b>immediate</b>
                     Unlink  cache  file after they were created. The cache files won't be visible anymore, even
                     though they're in use. This ensures they are guaranteed to be removed from  disk  when  the
                     player terminates, even if it crashes.

              <b>whendone</b>
                     Delete cache files after they are closed.

              <b>no</b>     Don't delete cache files. They will consume disk space without having a use.

              Currently, this is used for <b>--cache-on-disk</b> only.

       <b>--stream-buffer-size=&lt;bytesize&gt;</b>
              Size  of the low level stream byte buffer (default: 128KB). This is used as buffer between demuxer
              and low level I/O (e.g. sockets). Generally, this can be very  small,  and  the  main  purpose  is
              similar to the internal buffer FILE in the C standard library will have.

              Half  of  the  buffer  is  always used for guaranteed seek back, which is important for unseekable
              input.

              There are known cases where this can help performance to set a large buffer:

                 1. mp4 files. libavformat may trigger many small seeks in both directions, depending on how the
                    file was muxed.

                 2. Certain network filesystems, which do not have  a  cache,  and  where  small  reads  can  be
                    inefficient.

              In other cases, setting this to a large value can reduce performance.

              Usually,  read  accesses  are  at  half  the buffer size, but it may happen that accesses are done
              alternating with smaller and larger sizes (this is due to the internal ring buffer wrap-around).

              See <b>--list-options</b> for defaults and value range. <b>&lt;bytesize&gt;</b> options accept suffixes  such  as  <b>KiB</b>
              and <b>MiB</b>.

       <b>--vd-queue-enable=&lt;yes|no&gt;,</b> <b>--ad-queue-enable</b>
              Enable  running  the  video/audio  decoder  on  a  separate thread (default: no).  If enabled, the
              decoder is run on a separate thread, and a frame queue is put between  decoder  and  higher  level
              playback logic. The size of the frame queue is defined by the other options below.

              This  is  probably  quite  pointless.  libavcodec  already  has multithreaded decoding (enabled by
              default), which makes this largely unnecessary. It might help  in  some  corner  cases  with  high
              bandwidth  video that is slow to decode (in these cases libavcodec would block the playback logic,
              while using a decoding thread would distribute the decoding  time  evenly  without  affecting  the
              playback  logic).  In  other  situations, it will simply make seeking slower and use significantly
              more memory.

              The queue size is restricted by the other <b>--vd-queue-...</b> options. The  final  queue  size  is  the
              minimum  as  indicated  by  the option with the lowest limit. Each decoder/track has its own queue
              that may use the full configured queue size.

              Most queue options can be changed at runtime. <b>--vd-queue-enable</b> itself (and the audio  equivalent)
              update  only  if  decoding  is completely reinitialized. However, setting <b>--vd-queue-max-samples=1</b>
              should almost lead to the same behavior as <b>--vd-queue-enable=no</b>, so that value  can  be  used  for
              effectively runtime enabling/disabling the queue.

              This  should  not  be used with hardware decoding. It is possible to enable this for audio, but it
              makes even less sense.

       <b>--vd-queue-max-bytes=&lt;bytesize&gt;,</b> <b>--ad-queue-max-bytes</b>
              Maximum approximate allowed size of the queue. If exceeded, decoding will be stopped. The  maximum
              size can be exceeded by about 1 frame.

              See  <b>--list-options</b>  for  defaults and value range. <b>&lt;bytesize&gt;</b> options accept suffixes such as <b>KiB</b>
              and <b>MiB</b>.

       <b>--vd-queue-max-samples=&lt;int&gt;,</b> <b>--ad-queue-max-samples</b>
              Maximum number of frames (video) or samples (audio) of the queue. The audio size may  be  exceeded
              by about 1 frame.

              See <b>--list-options</b> for defaults and value range.

       <b>--vd-queue-max-secs=&lt;seconds&gt;,</b> <b>--ad-queue-max-secs</b>
              Maximum  number  of  seconds of media in the queue. The special value 0 means no limit is set. The
              queue size may be exceeded by about 2 frames. Timestamp resets  may  lead  to  random  queue  size
              usage.

              See <b>--list-options</b> for defaults and value range.

   <b>Network</b>
       <b>--user-agent=&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Use <b>&lt;string&gt;</b> as user agent for HTTP streaming.

       <b>--cookies=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Support cookies when making HTTP requests. Disabled by default.

       <b>--cookies-file=&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Read HTTP cookies from &lt;filename&gt;. The file is assumed to be in Netscape format.

       <b>--http-header-fields=&lt;field1,field2&gt;</b>
              Set custom HTTP fields when accessing HTTP stream.

              This is a string list option. See List Options for details.

                 Example

                     mpv --http-header-fields='Field1: value1','Field2: value2' \
                     <a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:1234

                 Will generate HTTP request:

                     GET / HTTP/1.0
                     Host: localhost:1234
                     User-Agent: MPlayer
                     Icy-MetaData: 1
                     Field1: value1
                     Field2: value2
                     Connection: close

       <b>--http-proxy=&lt;proxy&gt;</b>
              URL  of  the HTTP/HTTPS proxy. If this is set, the <b>http_proxy</b> environment is ignored. The <b>no_proxy</b>
              environment variable is still respected. This option is silently ignored if it does not start with
              <b>http://</b>. Proxies are not used for https URLs. Setting this option does not try to  make  the  ytdl
              script use the proxy.

       <b>--tls-ca-file=&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Certificate authority database file for use with TLS. (Silently fails with older FFmpeg versions.)

       <b>--tls-verify</b>
              Verify  peer  certificates  when  using  TLS  (e.g. with <b>https://...</b>).  (Silently fails with older
              FFmpeg versions.)

       <b>--tls-cert-file</b>
              A file containing a certificate to use in the handshake with the peer.

       <b>--tls-key-file</b>
              A file containing the private key for the certificate.

       <b>--referrer=&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Specify a referrer path or URL for HTTP requests.

       <b>--network-timeout=&lt;seconds&gt;</b>
              Specify the network timeout in seconds (default: 60 seconds). This  affects  at  least  HTTP.  The
              special  value  0 uses the FFmpeg defaults. If a protocol is used which does not support timeouts,
              this option is silently ignored.

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 This breaks the RTSP protocol, because  of  inconsistent  FFmpeg  API  regarding  its  internal
                 timeout  option.  Not only does the RTSP timeout option accept different units (seconds instead
                 of microseconds, causing mpv to pass it huge values), it will  also  overflow  FFmpeg  internal
                 calculations.  The  worst  is that merely setting the option will put RTSP into listening mode,
                 which breaks any client uses. At time of this writing, the fix was not made effective yet.  For
                 this  reason, this option is ignored (or should be ignored) on RTSP URLs. You can still set the
                 timeout option directly with <b>--demuxer-lavf-o</b>.

       <b>--rtsp-transport=&lt;lavf|udp|udp_multicast|tcp|http&gt;</b>
              Select RTSP transport method (default: tcp). This selects the underlying  network  transport  when
              playing <b>rtsp://...</b> URLs. The value <b>lavf</b> leaves the decision to libavformat.

       <b>--hls-bitrate=&lt;no|min|max|&lt;rate&gt;&gt;</b>
              If  HLS  streams are played, this option controls what streams are selected by default. The option
              allows the following parameters:

              <b>no</b>     Don't do anything special. Typically, this will simply pick the first  audio/video  streams
                     it can find.

              <b>min</b>    Pick the streams with the lowest bitrate.

              <b>max</b>    Same, but highest bitrate. (Default.)

              Additionally,  if  the  option  is  a  number, the stream with the highest rate equal or below the
              option value is selected.

              The bitrate as used is sent by the server, and there's no guarantee it's actually meaningful.

   <b>DVB</b>
       <b>--dvbin-prog=&lt;string&gt;</b>
              This defines the program to tune to. Usually, you may specify this by  using  a  stream  URI  like
              <b>"dvb://ZDF</b>  <b>HD"</b>,  but  you can tune to a different channel by writing to this property at runtime.
              Also see <b>dvbin-channel-switch-offset</b> for more useful channel switching functionality.

       <b>--dvbin-card=&lt;0-15&gt;</b>
              Specifies using card number 0-15 (default: 0).

       <b>--dvbin-file=&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Instructs mpv to read the channels list from <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>. The default is in the  mpv  configuration
              directory  (usually <b><a href="file:~/.config/mpv">~/.config/mpv</a></b>) with the filename <b>channels.conf.{sat,ter,cbl,atsc,isdbt}</b> (based
              on your card type) or <b>channels.conf</b> as a last resort.  Please note that using specific  file  name
              with  card  type  is  recommended,  since  the  legacy channel format is not fully standardized so
              autodetection of the delivery system may fail otherwise.  For DVB-S/2 cards, a  VDR  1.7.x  format
              channel  list  is  recommended  as  it  allows  tuning  to DVB-S2 channels, enabling subtitles and
              decoding the PMT (which largely improves the demuxing).  Classic mplayer format channel lists  are
              still  supported  (without  these improvements), and for other card types, only limited VDR format
              channel list support is implemented (patches welcome).  For channels with dynamic PID switching or
              incomplete <b>channels.conf</b>, <b>--dvbin-full-transponder</b> or the magic PID <b>8192</b> are recommended.

       <b>--dvbin-timeout=&lt;seconds&gt;</b>
              Maximum number of seconds to wait when trying to tune a frequency before giving up (default: 30).

       <b>--dvbin-full-transponder=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Apply no filters on program PIDs, only tune to frequency and pass  full  transponder  to  demuxer.
              The  player  frontend  selects  the streams from the full TS in this case, so the program which is
              shown initially may not match the chosen channel.  Switching between the programs is  possible  by
              cycling the <b>program</b> property.  This is useful to record multiple programs on a single transponder,
              or  to  work  around issues in the <b>channels.conf</b>.  It is also recommended to use this for channels
              which switch PIDs on-the-fly, e.g. for regional news.

              Default: <b>no</b>

       <b>--dvbin-channel-switch-offset=&lt;integer&gt;</b>
              This value is not meant  for  setting  via  configuration,  but  used  in  channel  switching.  An
              <b>input.conf</b>  can <b>cycle</b> this value <b>up</b> and <b>down</b> to perform channel switching. This number effectively
              gives the offset to the initially tuned to channel in the channel list.

              An  example  <b>input.conf</b>  could  contain:  <b>H</b>  <b>cycle</b>   <b>dvbin-channel-switch-offset</b>   <b>up</b>,   <b>K</b>   <b>cycle</b>
              <b>dvbin-channel-switch-offset</b> <b>down</b>

   <b>GPU</b> <b>renderer</b> <b>options</b>
       The  following video options are currently all specific to <b>--vo=gpu</b>, <b>--vo=libmpv</b> and <b>--vo=gpu-next</b>, which
       are the only VOs that implement them.

       <b>--scale=&lt;filter&gt;</b>
              The filter function to use when upscaling video.

              <b>bilinear</b>
                     Bilinear hardware texture filtering (fastest, very low quality). This is the  default  when
                     using the <b>fast</b> profile.

              <b>lanczos</b>
                     Lanczos  scaling.  Provides  good  balance  between  quality  and performance.  This is the
                     default for <b>scale</b>. The number of taps can be controlled with <b>scale-radius</b>, but is best left
                     unchanged.

                     (This filter is an alias for <b>sinc</b>-windowed <b>sinc</b>)

              <b>ewa_lanczos</b>
                     Elliptic weighted average Lanczos scaling. Also known as Jinc.  Relatively slow,  but  very
                     good  quality.  The radius can be controlled with <b>scale-radius</b>. Increasing the radius makes
                     the filter sharper but adds more ringing.

                     (This filter is an alias for <b>jinc</b>-windowed <b>jinc</b>)

              <b>ewa_lanczossharp</b>
                     A  slightly  sharpened  version  of  <b>ewa_lanczos</b>.  This  is  the  default  when  using  the
                     <b>high-quality</b>  profile.  Blur  value  determined  by  method originally developed by Nicolas
                     Robidoux for Image Magick, see:
                      &lt;https://www.imagemagick.org/discourse-server/viewtopic.php?p=89068#p89068&gt;

              <b>ewa_lanczos4sharpest</b>
                     Very sharp scaler, but also slightly slower than <b>ewa_lanczossharp</b>.  Prone  to  ringing,  so
                     it's  recommended  to  combine  this with an anti-ringing shader. On <b>--vo=gpu-next</b>, setting
                     this filter enables built-in anti-ringing, so no extra action needs to be taken.

                     <b>B</b> and <b>C</b> parameters can be controlled with <b>--scale-param1</b> and <b>--scale-param2</b>.

              <b>hermite</b>
                     Hermite spline. Similar to <b>bicubic</b> but with <b>B</b> set to <b>0.0</b>.   This  filter  has  the  special
                     property of having a support of radius 1.0, making it very fast in comparison, but prone to
                     blocking. This is the default for <b>--dscale</b>.

              <b>catmull_rom</b>
                     Catmull-Rom  spline. Similar to <b>mitchell</b>, but with <b>B</b> and <b>C</b> set to <b>0.0</b> and <b>0.5</b> respectively.
                     This filter is sharper than <b>mitchell</b>, but prone to ringing.

              <b>oversample</b>
                     A  version  of  nearest  neighbour  that  (naively)  oversamples  pixels,  so  that  pixels
                     overlapping  edges  get  linearly interpolated instead of rounded. This essentially removes
                     the small imperfections and judder artifacts caused by nearest-neighbour interpolation,  in
                     exchange for adding some blur. This can also be used for frame mixing, where it is commonly
                     known as "smoothmotion" (see <b>--tscale</b>).

              <b>linear</b> A <b>--tscale</b> filter.

              There  are some more filters, but most are not as useful. For a complete list, pass <b>help</b> as value,
              e.g.:

                 mpv --scale=help

       <b>--cscale=&lt;filter&gt;</b>
              As <b>--scale</b>, but for interpolating chroma information. If the image is not subsampled, this  option
              is ignored entirely. If this option is unset, the filter implied by <b>--scale</b> will be applied.

       <b>--dscale=&lt;filter&gt;</b>
              Like <b>--scale</b>, but apply these filters on downscaling instead.

       <b>--tscale=&lt;filter&gt;</b>
              The filter used for interpolating the temporal axis (frames). This is only used if <b>--interpolation</b>
              is  enabled.  The  only  valid  choices  for  <b>--tscale</b>  are  separable  convolution  filters  (use
              <b>--tscale=help</b> to get a list). The default is <b>oversample</b>.

              Common <b>--tscale</b> choices include <b>oversample</b>, <b>linear</b>, <b>catmull_rom</b>, <b>mitchell</b>, <b>gaussian</b>,  or  <b>bicubic</b>.
              These   are   listed  in  increasing  order  of  smoothness/blurriness,  with  <b>bicubic</b>  being  the
              smoothest/blurriest and <b>oversample</b> being the sharpest/least smooth.

       <b>--scale-param1=&lt;value&gt;,</b> <b>--scale-param2=&lt;value&gt;,</b> <b>--cscale-param1=&lt;value&gt;,</b> <b>--cscale-param2=&lt;value&gt;,</b>
       <b>--dscale-param1=&lt;value&gt;,</b> <b>--dscale-param2=&lt;value&gt;,</b> <b>--tscale-param1=&lt;value&gt;,</b> <b>--tscale-param2=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Set filter parameters. By default, these are set to the special string <b>default</b>, which  maps  to  a
              scaler-specific  default  value. Ignored if the filter is not tunable. Currently, this affects the
              following filter parameters:

              <b>bicubic</b>
                     Spline parameters (<b>B</b> and <b>C</b>). Defaults to B=1 and C=0.

              <b>gaussian</b>
                     Scale parameter (<b>t</b>). Increasing this makes the result blurrier.  Defaults to 1.

              <b>oversample</b>
                     Minimum distance to an edge before interpolation is used. Setting this  to  0  will  always
                     interpolate  edges,  whereas  setting it to 0.5 will never interpolate, thus behaving as if
                     the regular nearest neighbour algorithm was used. Defaults to 0.0.

       <b>--scale-blur=&lt;value&gt;,</b> <b>--cscale-blur=&lt;value&gt;,</b> <b>--dscale-blur=&lt;value&gt;,</b> <b>--tscale-blur=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Kernel scaling factor (also known as a blur factor). Decreasing this  makes  the  result  sharper,
              increasing  it  makes  it blurrier (default 0). If set to 0, the kernel's preferred blur factor is
              used. Note that setting this too low (eg. 0.5) leads to bad results. It's generally recommended to
              stick to values between 0.8 and 1.2.

       <b>--scale-clamp=&lt;0.0-1.0&gt;,</b> <b>--cscale-clamp,</b> <b>--dscale-clamp,</b> <b>--tscale-clamp</b>
              Specifies a weight bias to multiply into negative coefficients. Specifying <b>--scale-clamp=1</b> has the
              effect of removing negative weights completely, thus  effectively  clamping  the  value  range  to
              [0-1].  Values  between  0.0  and  1.0  can  be specified to apply only a moderate diminishment of
              negative weights. This is especially useful for  <b>--tscale</b>,  where  it  reduces  excessive  ringing
              artifacts  in the temporal domain (which typically manifest themselves as short flashes or fringes
              of black, mostly around moving edges) in exchange for potentially adding more  blur.  The  default
              for <b>--tscale-clamp</b> is 1.0, the others default to 0.0.

       <b>--scale-taper=&lt;value&gt;,</b> <b>--scale-wtaper=&lt;value&gt;,</b> <b>--dscale-taper=&lt;value&gt;,</b> <b>--dscale-wtaper=&lt;value&gt;,</b>
       <b>--cscale-taper=&lt;value&gt;,</b> <b>--cscale-wtaper=&lt;value&gt;,</b> <b>--tscale-taper=&lt;value&gt;,</b> <b>--tscale-wtaper=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Kernel/window  taper factor. Increasing this flattens the filter function.  Value range is 0 to 1.
              A value of 0 (the default) means no flattening, a value of 1  makes  the  filter  completely  flat
              (equivalent  to  a  box  function).  Values in between mean that some portion will be flat and the
              actual filter function will be squeezed into the space in between.

       <b>--scale-radius=&lt;value&gt;,</b> <b>--cscale-radius=&lt;value&gt;,</b> <b>--dscale-radius=&lt;value&gt;,</b> <b>--tscale-radius=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Set radius for tunable filters, must be a float number between  0.5  and  16.0.  Defaults  to  the
              filter's preferred radius if not specified. Doesn't work for every scaler and VO combination.

              Note  that  depending  on  filter  implementation details and video scaling ratio, the radius that
              actually being used might be different (most likely being increased a bit).

       <b>--scale-antiring=&lt;value&gt;,</b> <b>--cscale-antiring=&lt;value&gt;,</b> <b>--dscale-antiring=&lt;value&gt;,</b> <b>--tscale-antiring=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Set the antiringing strength. This tries to eliminate ringing, but can introduce  other  artifacts
              in  the  process.  Must  be  a float number between 0.0 and 1.0. The default value of 0.0 disables
              antiringing entirely.

              Note that this doesn't affect the special filters <b>bilinear</b> and <b>bicubic_fast</b>, nor  does  it  affect
              any polar (EWA) scalers.

              On  <b>--vo=gpu-next</b>,  this  also  affects  polar  (EWA)  scalers.  Certain  filter  aliases may also
              implicitly enable antiringing, regardless of this setting (see <b>--scale</b>).

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 When downscaling with separable (orthogonal) filters,  setting  <b>--dscale-antiring</b>  to  a  value
                 other  than  0.0  (default)  will  reduce  scaler  quality  and  produce aliasing artifacts. On
                 <b>--vo=gpu-next</b>, <b>--dscale-antiring</b> is disabled for separable (orthogonal) filters.

       <b>--scale-window=&lt;window&gt;,</b> <b>--cscale-window=&lt;window&gt;,</b> <b>--dscale-window=&lt;window&gt;,</b> <b>--tscale-window=&lt;window&gt;</b>
              (Advanced users only) Choose a custom windowing function for the kernel.  Defaults to the filter's
              preferred window if unset. Use <b>--scale-window=help</b> to get a list of supported windowing functions.

       <b>--scale-wparam=&lt;window&gt;,</b> <b>--cscale-wparam=&lt;window&gt;,</b> <b>--cscale-wparam=&lt;window&gt;,</b> <b>--tscale-wparam=&lt;window&gt;</b>
              (Advanced users only) Configure the parameter for the window function given by <b>--scale-window</b> etc.
              By default, these are set to the special string <b>default</b>, which maps to a  window-specific  default
              value.  Ignored  if  the  window  is  not  tunable.  Currently,  this affects the following window
              parameters:

              <b>kaiser</b> Window parameter (alpha). Defaults to 6.33.

              <b>blackman</b>
                     Window parameter (alpha). Defaults to 0.16.

              <b>gaussian</b>
                     Scale parameter (t). Increasing this makes the window wider. Defaults to 1.

       <b>--scaler-resizes-only</b>
              Disable the scaler if the video image is not resized. In that case, <b>bilinear</b> is  used  instead  of
              whatever  is set with <b>--scale</b>. Bilinear will reproduce the source image perfectly if no scaling is
              performed.  Enabled by default. Note that this option never affects <b>--cscale</b>.

       <b>--correct-downscaling</b>
              When using convolution based filters, extend the filter size when downscaling. Increases  quality,
              but reduces performance while downscaling.  Enabled by default.

              This  will  perform slightly sub-optimally for anamorphic video (but still better than without it)
              since it will extend the size to match only the milder of the scale factors between the axes.

              Note: this option is ignored when using bilinear downscaling with <b>--vo=gpu</b>.

       <b>--linear-downscaling</b>
              Scale in linear light when downscaling. It should only be used with a  <b>--fbo-format</b>  that  has  at
              least 16 bit precision. This option has no effect on HDR content. Enabled by default.

       <b>--linear-upscaling</b>
              Scale  in  linear  light  when upscaling. Like <b>--linear-downscaling</b>, it should only be used with a
              <b>--fbo-format</b> that has at least 16 bits precisions. This is  not  usually  recommended  except  for
              testing/specific  purposes.  Users  are  advised to either enable <b>--sigmoid-upscaling</b> or keep both
              options disabled (i.e. scaling in gamma light).

       <b>--sigmoid-upscaling</b>
              When upscaling, use a sigmoidal color transform to avoid emphasizing ringing artifacts. Enabled by
              default. This is incompatible with and replaces <b>--linear-upscaling</b>. (Note that sigmoidization also
              requires linearization, so the <b>LINEAR</b> rendering step fires in both cases)

              For more information about sigmoidization, see:
               &lt;https://imagemagick.org/Usage/resize/#resize_sigmoidal&gt;

       <b>--sigmoid-center</b>
              The center of the sigmoid curve used for <b>--sigmoid-upscaling</b>, must be a float between 0.0 and 1.0.
              Defaults to 0.75 if not specified.

       <b>--sigmoid-slope</b>
              The slope of the sigmoid curve used for <b>--sigmoid-upscaling</b>, must be a float between 1.0 and 20.0.
              Defaults to 6.5 if not specified.

       <b>--interpolation</b>
              Reduce stuttering caused by mismatches in the video fps and display refresh rate  (also  known  as
              judder).

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 This  requires  setting  the  <b>--video-sync</b>  option  to one of the <b>display-</b> modes, or it will be
                 silently disabled.  This was not required before mpv 0.14.0.

              This essentially attempts to interpolate the missing frames by convoluting  the  video  along  the
              temporal axis. The filter used can be controlled using the <b>--tscale</b> setting.

       <b>--interpolation-threshold=&lt;0..1,-1&gt;</b>
              Threshold  below which frame ratio interpolation gets disabled (default: <b>0.01</b>). This is calculated
              as <b>abs(disphz/vfps</b> <b>-</b> <b>1)</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>threshold</b>, where <b>vfps</b> is the speed-adjusted video FPS,  and  <b>disphz</b>  the
              display  refresh rate. (The speed-adjusted video FPS is roughly equal to the normal video FPS, but
              with slowdown and speedup applied. This matters if you use <b>--video-sync=display-resample</b>  to  make
              video run synchronously to the display FPS, or if you change the <b>speed</b> property.)

              The   default   is  intended  to  enable  interpolation  in  scenarios  where  retiming  with  the
              <b>--video-sync=display-*</b> cannot adjust the speed of the video sufficiently for smooth playback.  For
              example  if  a  video  is  60.00 FPS and your display refresh rate is 59.94 Hz, interpolation will
              never be activated, since the mismatch is within 1% of the refresh rate. The default also  handles
              the scenario when mpv cannot determine the container FPS, such as during certain live streams, and
              may dynamically toggle interpolation on and off. In this scenario, the default would be to not use
              interpolation  but  rather  to  allow  <b>--video-sync=display-*</b> to retime the video to match display
              refresh rate. See <b>--video-sync-max-video-change</b> for more information about  how  mpv  will  retime
              video.

              Also  note  that  if  you  use  e.g.  <b>--video-sync=display-vdrop</b>, small deviations in the rate can
              disable interpolation and introduce a discontinuity every other minute.

              Set this to <b>-1</b> to disable this logic.

       <b>--interpolation-preserve</b>
              Preserve the previous frames' interpolated results even when renderer  parameters  are  changed  -
              with the exception of options related to cropping and video placement, which always invalidate the
              cache.  Enabling  this  option makes dynamic updates of renderer settings slightly smoother at the
              cost of slightly higher latency in response  to  such  changes.  Defaults  to  on.  (Only  affects
              <b>--vo=gpu-next</b>, note that <b>--vo=gpu</b> always invalidates interpolated frames)

       <b>--opengl-pbo</b>
              Enable  use  of  PBOs.  On some drivers this can be faster, especially if the source video size is
              huge (e.g. so called "4K" video). On other drivers it might be slower or cause latency issues.

       <b>--dither-depth=&lt;N|no|auto&gt;</b>
              Set dither target depth to N. Default: auto.

              <b>no</b>     Disable any dithering done by mpv.

              <b>auto</b>   Automatic selection.  On <b>--vo=gpu</b>: detected depth or  8  bpc  otherwise  On  <b>--vo=gpu-next</b>:
                     detected depth or 8 bpc (for SDR target)

              <b>8</b>      Dither to 8 bit output.

              Note that the on-the-wire bit depth cannot be detected except when using <b>gpu-api=d3d11</b>. Explicitly
              setting  the  value to your display's bit depth is recommended, as dithering performed by some LCD
              panels can be of low quality.

       <b>--dither-size-fruit=&lt;2-8&gt;</b>
              Set the size of the dither matrix (default: 6). The actual size of the matrix is <b>(2^N)</b> <b>x</b> <b>(2^N)</b> for
              an option value of <b>N</b>, so a value of 6 gives a size of 64x64. The matrix is  generated  at  startup
              time, and a large matrix can take rather long to compute (seconds).

              Used in <b>--dither=fruit</b> mode only.

       <b>--dither=&lt;fruit|ordered|error-diffusion|no&gt;</b>
              Select dithering algorithm (default: fruit). (Normally, the <b>--dither-depth</b> option controls whether
              dithering is enabled.)

              The  <b>error-diffusion</b>  option  requires  compute  shader  support. It also requires large amount of
              shared memory to run, the size of which depends on both the kernel (see  <b>--error-diffusion</b>  option
              below)  and  the height of video window. It will fallback to <b>fruit</b> dithering if there is no enough
              shared memory to run the shader.

       <b>--temporal-dither</b>
              Enable temporal dithering. (Only active if dithering is enabled in general.) This changes  between
              8  different  dithering  patterns on each frame by changing the orientation of the tiled dithering
              matrix. Unfortunately, this can lead to flicker on LCD displays, since these have a high  reaction
              time.

       <b>--temporal-dither-period=&lt;1-128&gt;</b>
              Determines  how  often  the  dithering pattern is updated when <b>--temporal-dither</b> is in use. 1 (the
              default) will update on every video frame, 2 on every other frame, etc.

       <b>--error-diffusion=&lt;kernel&gt;</b>
              The error diffusion kernel to use when <b>--dither=error-diffusion</b> is set.

              <b>simple</b> Propagate error to only two adjacent pixels. Fastest but low quality.

              <b>sierra-lite</b>
                     Fast with reasonable quality. This is the default.

              <b>floyd-steinberg</b>
                     Most notable error diffusion kernel.

              <b>atkinson</b>
                     Looks different from other kernels because only  fraction  of  errors  will  be  propagated
                     during  dithering.  A  typical  use  case  of this kernel is saving dithered screenshot (in
                     window mode). This kernel produces slightly smaller file, with still  reasonable  dithering
                     quality.

              There  are other kernels (use <b>--error-diffusion=help</b> to list) but most of them are much slower and
              demanding even larger amount of shared memory.   Among  these  kernels,  <b>burkes</b>  achieves  a  good
              balance between performance and quality, and probably is the one you want to try first.

       <b>--gpu-debug</b>
              Enables GPU debugging. What this means depends on the API type. For OpenGL, it calls <b>glGetError()</b>,
              and requests a debug context. For Vulkan, it enables validation layers.

       <b>--opengl-swapinterval=&lt;n&gt;</b>
              Interval  in  displayed  frames  between  two  buffer swaps. 1 is equivalent to enable VSYNC, 0 to
              disable VSYNC. Defaults to 1 if not specified.

              Note that this depends on proper OpenGL vsync support. On some platforms and  drivers,  this  only
              works  reliably  when  in  fullscreen  mode.  It  may  also require driver-specific hacks if using
              multiple monitors, to ensure mpv syncs to the right one. Compositing window managers can also lead
              to bad results, as can missing or incorrect display FPS information (see <b>--display-fps-override</b>).

       <b>--egl-config-id=&lt;ID&gt;</b>
              (EGL only) Select EGLConfig with specific EGL_CONFIG_ID.  Rendering surfaces and contexts will  be
              created  using  this  EGLConfig.   You  can use <b>--msg-level=vo=trace</b> to obtain a list of available
              configs.

       <b>--egl-output-format=&lt;auto|rgb8|rgba8|rgb10|rgb10_a2|rgb16|rgba16|rgb16f|rgba16f|rgb32f|rgba32f&gt;</b>
              (EGL only) Select a specific EGL output format to utilize for OpenGL rendering.   This  option  is
              mutually  exclusive with <b>--egl-config-id</b>.  "auto" is the default, which will pick the first usable
              config based on the order given by the driver.

              All formats are not available.  A fatal error is caused if an unavailable format is selected.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 There is no reliable API to query desktop bit depth in EGL.  You can manually set  this  option
                 according  to  the  bit  depth of your display.  This option also affects the auto-detection of
                 <b>--dither-depth</b>.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Unlike  <b>--d3d11-output-format</b>, this option also takes effect with <b>--vo=gpu-next</b>.

       <b>--vulkan-device=&lt;device</b> <b>name|UUID&gt;</b>
              The  name  or  UUID  of  the  Vulkan  device  to  use  for   rendering   and   presentation.   Use
              <b>--vulkan-device=help</b>  to  see  the  list  of  available devices and their names and UUIDs. If left
              unspecified, the first enumerated hardware Vulkan device will be used.

       <b>--vulkan-swap-mode=&lt;mode&gt;</b>
              Controls  the  presentation  mode  of   the   vulkan   swapchain.   This   is   similar   to   the
              <b>--opengl-swapinterval</b> option.

              <b>auto</b>   Use the preferred swapchain mode for the vulkan context. (Default)

              <b>fifo</b>   Non-tearing, vsync blocked. Similar to "VSync on".

              <b>fifo-relaxed</b>
                     Tearing, vsync blocked. Late frames will tear instead of stuttering.

              <b>mailbox</b>
                     Non-tearing, not vsync blocked. Similar to "triple buffering".

              <b>immediate</b>
                     Tearing, not vsync blocked. Similar to "VSync off".

       <b>--vulkan-queue-count=&lt;1..8&gt;</b>
              Controls  the number of VkQueues used for rendering (limited by how many your device supports). In
              theory,  using  more  queues  could  enable  some  parallelism  between  frames  (when   using   a
              <b>--swapchain-depth</b>  higher  than  1), but it can also slow things down on hardware where there's no
              true parallelism between queues. (Default: 1)

       <b>--vulkan-async-transfer</b>
              Enables the use of async transfer queues on supported vulkan devices. Using them  allows  transfer
              operations  like  texture uploads and blits to happen concurrently with the actual rendering, thus
              improving overall throughput and power consumption. Enabled by default, and should  be  relatively
              safe.

       <b>--vulkan-async-compute</b>
              Enables the use of async compute queues on supported vulkan devices. Using this, in theory, allows
              out-of-order scheduling of compute shaders with graphics shaders, thus enabling the hardware to do
              more  effective  work  while waiting for pipeline bubbles and memory operations. Not beneficial on
              all GPUs. It's worth noting that if async compute is enabled, and the device supports more compute
              queues than graphics queues (bound by the restrictions  set  by  <b>--vulkan-queue-count</b>),  mpv  will
              internally  try  and  prefer  the  use of compute shaders over fragment shaders wherever possible.
              Enabled by default, although Nvidia users may want to disable it.

       <b>--vulkan-display-display=&lt;n&gt;</b>
              The index of the display, on the selected Vulkan device, to present on when  using  the  <b>displayvk</b>
              GPU  context.  Use  <b>--vulkan-display-display=help</b>  to  see the list of available displays. If left
              unspecified, the first enumerated display will be used.

       <b>--vulkan-display-mode=&lt;n&gt;</b>
              The index of the display mode, of the selected Vulkan display, to use when using the <b>displayvk</b> GPU
              context. Use <b>--vulkan-display-mode=help</b> to see the list of available modes. If  left  unspecified,
              the first enumerated mode will be used.

       <b>--vulkan-display-plane=&lt;n&gt;</b>
              The  index of the plane, on the selected Vulkan device, to present on when using the <b>displayvk</b> GPU
              context. Use <b>--vulkan-display-plane=help</b> to see the list of available planes. If left unspecified,
              the first enumerated plane will be used.

       <b>--d3d11-exclusive-fs=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Switches the D3D11 swap chain fullscreen state to 'fullscreen' when fullscreen video is requested.
              Also known as "exclusive fullscreen" or "D3D fullscreen" in other  applications.  Gives  mpv  full
              control of rendering on the swap chain's screen. Off by default.

       <b>--d3d11-warp=&lt;yes|no|auto&gt;</b>
              Use  WARP  (Windows  Advanced  Rasterization Platform) with the D3D11 GPU backend (default: auto).
              This is a high performance software renderer. By default, it is only used when the system  has  no
              hardware  adapters  that  support D3D11. While the extended GPU features will work with WARP, they
              can be very slow.

       <b>--d3d11-feature-level=&lt;12_1|12_0|11_1|11_0|10_1|10_0|9_3|9_2|9_1&gt;</b>
              Select a specific feature level when  using  the  D3D11  GPU  backend.  By  default,  the  highest
              available feature level is used. This option can be used to select a lower feature level, which is
              mainly useful for debugging.  Most extended GPU features will not work at 9_x feature levels.

       <b>--d3d11-flip=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Enable  flip-model  presentation,  which  avoids  unnecessarily  copying the backbuffer by sharing
              surfaces with the DWM (default: yes). This may cause performance issues  with  older  drivers.  If
              flip-model  presentation is not supported (for example, on Windows 7 without the platform update),
              mpv will automatically fall back to the older bitblt presentation model.

              flip-model needs presentation needs to be disabled for background transparency to work.

       <b>--d3d11-sync-interval=&lt;0..4&gt;</b>
              Schedule each frame to be presented for this number of VBlank intervals.  (default: 1) Setting  to
              1 will enable VSync, setting to 0 will disable it.

       <b>--d3d11-adapter=&lt;adapter</b> <b>name|help&gt;</b>
              Select  a specific D3D11 adapter to utilize for D3D11 rendering.  Will pick the default adapter if
              unset. Alternatives are listed when the name "help" is given.

              Checks for matches based on the start of the string, case insensitive. Thus, if the description of
              the adapter starts with the vendor name, that can be utilized as the selection parameter.

              Hardware decoders utilizing the D3D11 rendering abstraction's helper functionality  to  receive  a
              device, such as D3D11VA or DXVA2's DXGI mode, will be affected by this choice.

       <b>--d3d11-output-format=&lt;auto|rgba8|bgra8|rgb10_a2|rgba16f&gt;</b>
              Select  a  specific  D3D11  output  format to utilize for D3D11 rendering.  "auto" is the default,
              which will pick either rgba8 or rgb10_a2 depending on the configured desktop  bit  depth.  rgba16f
              and bgra8 are left out of the autodetection logic, and are available for manual testing.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Desktop  bit  depth  querying  is only available from an API available from Windows 10. Thus on
                 older systems it will only automatically utilize the rgba8 output format.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 For <b>--vo=gpu-next</b>, this is used as a best-effort hint and libplacebo has the last say on  which
                 format is utilized.

       <b>--d3d11-output-csp=&lt;auto|srgb|linear|pq|bt.2020&gt;</b>
              Select a specific D3D11 output color space to utilize for D3D11 rendering.  "auto" is the default,
              which will select the color space of the desktop on which the swap chain is located.

              Values  other  than  "srgb"  and "pq" have had issues in testing, so they are mostly available for
              manual testing.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Swap chain color space configuration is only available from an API available from  Windows  10.
                 Thus on older systems it will not work.

       <b>--d3d11va-zero-copy=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              By  default,  when  using  hardware  decoding with <b>--gpu-api=d3d11</b>, the video image will be copied
              (GPU-to-GPU) from the decoder surface to a shader resource. Set this option to avoid that copy  by
              sampling  directly  from  the decoder image. This may increase performance and reduce power usage,
              but can cause the image to be sampled incorrectly on the bottom and right edges  due  to  padding,
              and  may  invoke driver bugs, since Direct3D 11 technically does not allow sampling from a decoder
              surface (though most drivers support it.)

              Currently only relevant for <b>--gpu-api=d3d11</b>.

       <b>--wayland-app-id=&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Set the client app id for Wayland-based video output methods (default: <b>mpv</b>).

       <b>--wayland-configure-bounds=&lt;auto|yes|no&gt;</b>
              Controls whether or not mpv opts into the  configure  bounds  event  if  sent  by  the  compositor
              (default:  auto).  This  restricts  the  initial  size of the mpv window to a certain maximum size
              intended by the compositor. In most cases, this simply just prevents the  mpv  window  from  being
              larger  than  the  size  of  the  monitor  when  it first renders. With the default value of <b>auto</b>,
              configure-bounds will silently be ignored if any <b>autofit</b> or <b>geometry</b> type option is also set.

       <b>--wayland-content-type=&lt;auto|none|photo|video|game&gt;</b>
              If supported by the compositor, mpv will send a hint using the content-type protocol  telling  the
              compositor  what  type  of  content  is  being displayed. <b>auto</b> (default) will automatically switch
              between telling the compositor the content is  a  photo,  video  or  possibly  none  depending  on
              internal heuristics.

       <b>--wayland-edge-pixels-pointer=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Defines  the  size  of  an  edge border (default: 16) to initiate client side resize events in the
              wayland contexts with the mouse. This is only active if there are no server side decorations  from
              the compositor.

       <b>--wayland-edge-pixels-touch=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Defines  the  size  of  an edge border (default: 32) to initiate client side resizes events in the
              wayland contexts with touch events.

       <b>--wayland-internal-vsync=&lt;no|auto|yes&gt;</b>
              Controls whether to use mpv's internal vsync for Wayland-base video outputs (default: <b>auto</b>).  This
              is  mainly  useful  for  benchmarking  wayland  VOs  when combined with <b>video-sync=display-desync</b>,
              <b>--audio=no</b>, and <b>--untimed=yes</b>. The special <b>auto</b> value will  disable  the  internal  vsync  if  the
              compositor  supports  the fifo protocol and version 2 of the presentation time protocol when using
              <b>--gpu-api=vulkan</b>. In any other situation, it is exactly the same as <b>yes</b>.

       <b>--wayland-present=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Enable the use of wayland's presentation time protocol for more accurate frame presentation if  it
              is   supported   by   the   compositor   (default:   <b>yes</b>).    This   only   has   an   effect   if
              <b>--video-sync=display-...</b> is being used.

       <b>--spirv-compiler=&lt;compiler&gt;</b>
              Controls which compiler  is  used  to  translate  GLSL  to  SPIR-V.  This  is  only  relevant  for
              <b>--gpu-api=d3d11</b> with <b>--vo=gpu</b>.  The possible choices are currently:

              <b>auto</b>   Use the first available compiler. (Default)

              <b>shaderc</b>
                     Use  libshaderc,  which  is  an  API  wrapper  around  glslang.  This is generally the most
                     preferred, if available.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This option is deprecated, since there is only one usable value.  It  may  be  removed  in  the
                 future.

       <b>--glsl-shader=&lt;file&gt;,</b> <b>--glsl-shaders=&lt;file-list&gt;</b>
              Custom  GLSL hooks. These are a flexible way to add custom fragment shaders, which can be injected
              at almost arbitrary points in  the  rendering  pipeline,  and  access  all  previous  intermediate
              textures.

              Each  use of the <b>--glsl-shader</b> option will add another file to the internal list of shaders, while
              <b>--glsl-shaders</b> takes a list of files, and overwrites the internal list with it. The  latter  is  a
              path list option (see List Options for details).

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 The syntax is not stable yet and may change any time.

              The general syntax of a user shader looks like this:

                 //!METADATA ARGS...
                 //!METADATA ARGS...

                 vec4 hook() {
                    ...
                    return something;
                 }

                 //!METADATA ARGS...
                 //!METADATA ARGS...

                 ...

              Each  section  of  metadata,  along  with the non-metadata lines after it, defines a single block.
              There are currently two types of blocks, HOOKs and TEXTUREs.

              A <b>TEXTURE</b> block can set the following options:

              <b>TEXTURE</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>(required)</b>
                     The name of this texture. Hooks can then bind the texture under this name using BIND.  This
                     must be the first option of the texture block.

              <b>SIZE</b> <b>&lt;width&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;height&gt;]</b> <b>[&lt;depth&gt;]</b> <b>(required)</b>
                     The  dimensions of the texture. The height and depth are optional. The type of texture (1D,
                     2D or 3D) depends on the number of components specified.

              <b>FORMAT</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>(required)</b>
                     The texture format for the samples. Supported texture formats are listed in  debug  logging
                     when  the  <b>gpu</b>  VO is initialized (look for <b>Texture</b> <b>formats:</b>). Usually, this follows OpenGL
                     naming conventions.  For  example,  <b>rgb16</b>  provides  3  channels  with  normalized  16  bit
                     components.  One  oddity  are  float  formats:  for  example,  <b>rgba16f</b>  has 16 bit internal
                     precision, but the texture data is provided as 32 bit floats, and the driver  converts  the
                     data on texture upload.

                     Although  format  names follow a common naming convention, not all of them are available on
                     all hardware, drivers, GL versions, and so on.

              <b>FILTER</b> <b>&lt;LINEAR|NEAREST&gt;</b>
                     The min/magnification filter used when sampling from this texture.

              <b>BORDER</b> <b>&lt;CLAMP|REPEAT|MIRROR&gt;</b>
                     The border wrapping mode used when sampling from this texture.

              Following the metadata is a string of bytes in hexadecimal notation that define  the  raw  texture
              data, corresponding to the format specified by <u>FORMAT</u>, on a single line with no extra whitespace.

              A <b>HOOK</b> block can set the following options:

              <b>HOOK</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>(required)</b>
                     The  texture  which to hook into. May occur multiple times within a metadata block, up to a
                     predetermined limit. See below for a list of hookable textures.

              <b>DESC</b> <b>&lt;title&gt;</b>
                     User-friendly description of the pass. This is the name used when representing this  shader
                     in the list of passes for property <u>vo-passes</u>.

              <b>BIND</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>
                     Loads  a texture (either coming from mpv or from a <b>TEXTURE</b> block) and makes it available to
                     the pass. When binding textures from mpv, this  will  also  set  up  macros  to  facilitate
                     accessing it properly. See below for a list. By default, no textures are bound. The special
                     name HOOKED can be used to refer to the texture that triggered this pass.

              <b>SAVE</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>
                     Gives the name of the texture to save the result of this pass into. By default, this is set
                     to the special name HOOKED which has the effect of overwriting the hooked texture.

              <b>WIDTH</b> <b>&lt;szexpr&gt;,</b> <b>HEIGHT</b> <b>&lt;szexpr&gt;</b>
                     Specifies  the  size of the resulting texture for this pass. <b>szexpr</b> refers to an expression
                     in RPN (reverse polish notation), using the operators +  -  *  /  &gt;  &lt;  !,  floating  point
                     literals,   and   references   to   sizes  of  existing  texture  (such  as  MAIN.width  or
                     CHROMA.height),  OUTPUT,  or  NATIVE_CROPPED  (size  of  an  input  texture  cropped  after
                     pan-and-scan,  video-align-x/y,  video-pan-x/y,  etc.  and possibly prescaled). By default,
                     these are set to HOOKED.w and HOOKED.h, espectively.

              <b>WHEN</b> <b>&lt;szexpr&gt;</b>
                     Specifies a condition that needs  to  be  true  (non-zero)  for  the  shader  stage  to  be
                     evaluated.  If  it  fails, it will silently be omitted. (Note that a shader stage like this
                     which has a dependency on an optional hook point can still cause  that  hook  point  to  be
                     saved, which has some minor overhead)

              <b>OFFSET</b> <b>&lt;ox</b> <b>oy</b> <b>|</b> <b>ALIGN&gt;</b>
                     Indicates  a  pixel  shift  (offset)  introduced  by this pass. These pixel offsets will be
                     accumulated and corrected during the next scaling  pass  (<b>cscale</b>  or  <b>scale</b>).  The  default
                     values  are  0  0  which  correspond  to  no  shift. Note that offsets are ignored when not
                     overwriting the hooked texture.

                     A special value of <b>ALIGN</b> will attempt to fix existing offset of HOOKED  by  align  it  with
                     reference.  It  requires  HOOKED  to  be resizable (see below). It works transparently with
                     fragment shader. For compute shader, the predefined <b>texmap</b>  macro  is  required  to  handle
                     coordinate mapping.

              <b>COMPONENTS</b> <b>&lt;n&gt;</b>
                     Specifies  how  many  components of this pass's output are relevant and should be stored in
                     the texture, up to 4 (rgba). By default, this value is equal to the number of components in
                     HOOKED.

              <b>COMPUTE</b> <b>&lt;bw&gt;</b> <b>&lt;bh&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;tw&gt;</b> <b>&lt;th&gt;]</b>
                     Specifies that this shader should be treated as a compute shader, with the  block  size  bw
                     and  bh.  The  compute  shader will be dispatched with however many blocks are necessary to
                     completely tile over the output.  Within each block, there will be tw*th threads, forming a
                     single work group. In other words: tw and th specify the work  group  size,  which  can  be
                     different from the block size. So for example, a compute shader with bw, bh = 32 and tw, th
                     =  8  running  on a 500x500 texture would dispatch 16x16 blocks (rounded up), each with 8x8
                     threads.

                     Compute shaders in mpv are treated a  bit  different  from  fragment  shaders.  Instead  of
                     defining  a  <b>vec4</b>  <b>hook</b> that produces an output sample, you directly define <b>void</b> <b>hook</b> which
                     writes to a fixed writeonly image unit  named  <b>out_image</b>  (this  is  bound  by  mpv)  using
                     <u>imageStore</u>.  To help translate texture coordinates in the absence of vertices, mpv provides
                     a special function <b>NAME_map(id)</b> to map from the texel space of  the  output  image  to  the
                     texture  coordinates  for  all  bound  textures.  In  particular, <b>NAME_pos</b> is equivalent to
                     <b>NAME_map(gl_GlobalInvocationID)</b>, although using this only really makes sense if (tw,th)  ==
                     (bw,bh).

              Each  bound  mpv  texture  (via <b>BIND</b>) will make available the following definitions to that shader
              pass, where NAME is the name of the bound texture:

              <b>vec4</b> <b>NAME_tex(vec2</b> <b>pos)</b>
                     The sampling function to use to access the texture at a certain spot (in texture coordinate
                     space, range [0,1]). This takes care of any necessary normalization conversions.

              <b>vec4</b> <b>NAME_texOff(vec2</b> <b>offset)</b>
                     Sample the texture at a certain offset in pixels. This works like NAME_tex but additionally
                     takes care of necessary rotations, so that sampling at e.g. vec2(-1,0) is always one  pixel
                     to the left.

              <b>vec2</b> <b>NAME_pos</b>
                     The local texture coordinate of that texture, range [0,1].

              <b>vec2</b> <b>NAME_size</b>
                     The (rotated) size in pixels of the texture.

              <b>mat2</b> <b>NAME_rot</b>
                     The  rotation  matrix  associated  with  this  texture.  (Rotates  pixel  space  to texture
                     coordinates)

              <b>vec2</b> <b>NAME_pt</b>
                     The (unrotated) size of a single pixel, range [0,1].

              <b>float</b> <b>NAME_mul</b>
                     The coefficient that needs to be multiplied into the texture contents in order to normalize
                     it to the range [0,1].

              <b>sampler</b> <b>NAME_raw</b>
                     The raw bound texture  itself.  The  use  of  this  should  be  avoided  unless  absolutely
                     necessary.

              Normally,  users  should  use  either  NAME_tex  or NAME_texOff to read from the texture. For some
              shaders however , it can be better for performance to do custom sampling from NAME_raw,  in  which
              case care needs to be taken to respect NAME_mul and NAME_rot.

              In addition to these parameters, the following uniforms are also globally available:

              <b>float</b> <b>random</b>
                     A random number in the range [0-1], different per frame.

              <b>int</b> <b>frame</b>
                     A  simple count of frames rendered, increases by one per frame and never resets (regardless
                     of seeks).

              <b>vec2</b> <b>input_size</b>
                     The size in pixels of the input image (possibly cropped and prescaled).

              <b>vec2</b> <b>target_size</b>
                     The size in pixels of the visible part of the scaled (and possibly cropped) image.

              <b>vec2</b> <b>tex_offset</b>
                     Texture offset introduced  by  user  shaders  or  options  like  panscan,  video-align-x/y,
                     video-pan-x/y.

              Internally,  vo_gpu  may  generate  any  number  of the following textures.  Whenever a texture is
              rendered and saved by vo_gpu, all of the passes that have hooked into it will run,  in  the  order
              they were added by the user. This is a list of the legal hook points:

              <b>RGB,</b> <b>LUMA,</b> <b>CHROMA,</b> <b>ALPHA,</b> <b>XYZ</b> <b>(resizable)</b>
                     Source planes (raw). Which of these fire depends on the image format of the source.

              <b>CHROMA_SCALED,</b> <b>ALPHA_SCALED</b> <b>(fixed)</b>
                     Source planes (upscaled). These only fire on subsampled content.

              <b>NATIVE</b> <b>(resizable)</b>
                     The combined image, in the source colorspace, before conversion to RGB.

              <b>MAINPRESUB</b> <b>(resizable)</b>
                     The image, after conversion to RGB, but before <b>--blend-subtitles=video</b> is applied.

              <b>MAIN</b> <b>(resizable)</b>
                     The main image, after conversion to RGB but before upscaling.

              <b>LINEAR</b> <b>(fixed)</b>
                     Linear   light   image,   before   scaling.   This   only  fires  when  <b>--linear-upscaling</b>,
                     <b>--linear-downscaling</b> or <b>--sigmoid-upscaling</b> is in effect.

              <b>SIGMOID</b> <b>(fixed)</b>
                     Sigmoidized light, before scaling. This only fires when <b>--sigmoid-upscaling</b> is in effect.

              <b>PREKERNEL</b> <b>(fixed)</b>
                     The image immediately before the scaler kernel runs.

              <b>POSTKERNEL</b> <b>(fixed)</b>
                     The image immediately after the scaler kernel runs.

              <b>SCALED</b> <b>(fixed)</b>
                     The final upscaled image, before color management.

              <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>(fixed)</b>
                     The final output image, after color management but before dithering and drawing to screen.

              Only the textures labelled with <b>resizable</b> may be transformed  by  the  pass.  When  overwriting  a
              texture marked <b>fixed</b>, the WIDTH, HEIGHT and OFFSET must be left at their default values.

       <b>--glsl-shader=&lt;file&gt;</b>
              CLI/config file only alias for <b>--glsl-shaders-append</b>.

       <b>--glsl-shader-opts=param1=value1,param2=value2,...</b>
              Specifies  the options to use for tunable shader parameters. You can target specific named shaders
              by prefixing the shader name with a <b>/</b>, e.g.   <b>shader/param=value</b>.  Without  a  prefix,  parameters
              affect  all  shaders.   The  shader  name  is  the  base  part of the shader filename, without the
              extension. (<b>--vo=gpu-next</b> only)

              Some parameters are filled  automatically  if  the  shader  requests  them.   Currently  following
              parameters are available:

              <b>PTS</b>    PTS of the current frame in seconds.

              <b>chroma_offset_x</b>
                     chroma offset to the reference plane in x direction.

              <b>chroma_offset_y</b>
                     chroma offset to the reference plane in y direction.

              <b>min_luma</b>
                     Minimum luminance value (in cd/m²).

              <b>max_luma</b>
                     Maximum luminance value (in cd/m²).

              <b>max_cll</b>
                     Maximum Content Light Level (in cd/m²).

              <b>max_fall</b>
                     Maximum Frame Average Light Level (in cd/m²).

              <b>scene_max_r</b>
                     Maximum scene light level of the red channel (in cd/m²).

              <b>scene_max_g</b>
                     Maximum scene light level of the green channel (in cd/m²).

              <b>scene_max_b</b>
                     Maximum scene light level of the blue channel (in cd/m²).

              <b>scene_avg</b>
                     Average scene light level (in cd/m²).

              <b>max_pq_y</b>
                     Maximum PQ luminance (in PQ, 0-1).

              <b>avg_pq_y</b>
                     Average PQ luminance (in PQ, 0-1).

       <b>--deband</b>
              Enable  the  debanding algorithm. This greatly reduces the amount of visible banding, blocking and
              other quantization artifacts, at the expense of very slightly blurring some of the finest details.
              In practice, it's virtually always an improvement - the only reason to disable  it  would  be  for
              performance.

       <b>--deband-iterations=&lt;0..16&gt;</b>
              The  number  of  debanding  steps to perform per sample. Each step reduces a bit more banding, but
              takes time to compute. Note that the strength of each step falls off very quickly, so high numbers
              (&gt;4) are practically useless.  (Default 1)

       <b>--deband-threshold=&lt;0..4096&gt;</b>
              The  debanding  filter's  cut-off  threshold.  Higher  numbers  increase  the  debanding  strength
              dramatically but progressively diminish image details.  (Default 48)

       <b>--deband-range=&lt;1..64&gt;</b>
              The  debanding filter's initial radius. The radius increases linearly for each iteration. A higher
              radius will find more gradients, but a lower radius will smooth more aggressively. (Default 16)

              If you increase the <b>--deband-iterations</b>, you should probably decrease this to compensate.

       <b>--deband-grain=&lt;0..4096&gt;</b>
              Add some extra noise to the image.  This  significantly  helps  cover  up  remaining  quantization
              artifacts. Higher numbers add more noise. (Default 32)

       <b>--corner-rounding=&lt;0..1&gt;</b>
              If  set  to  a  value  above 0.0, the output will be rendered with rounded corners, as if an alpha
              transparency mask had been applied. The value indicates the relative fraction of the  side  length
              to round - a value of 1.0 rounds the corners as much as possible. (<b>--vo=gpu-next</b> only)

       <b>--sharpen=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              If set to a value other than 0, enable an unsharp masking filter. Positive values will sharpen the
              image  (but  add  more  ringing and aliasing). Negative values will blur the image. If your GPU is
              powerful enough, consider alternatives like the <b>ewa_lanczossharp</b> scale filter, or the <b>--scale-blur</b>
              option. (Only for <b>--vo=gpu</b>)

       <b>--opengl-glfinish</b>
              Call <b>glFinish()</b> before swapping buffers (default: disabled). Slower,  but  might  improve  results
              when  doing  framedropping.  Can  completely  ruin performance. The details depend entirely on the
              OpenGL driver.

       <b>--opengl-waitvsync</b>
              Call <b>glXWaitVideoSyncSGI</b> after each buffer swap (default: disabled).  This may  or  may  not  help
              with  video  timing accuracy and frame drop. It's possible that this makes video output slower, or
              has no effect at all.

              X11/GLX only.

       <b>--opengl-dwmflush=&lt;no|windowed|yes|auto&gt;</b>
              (Windows only) Calls <b>DwmFlush</b> after swapping buffers on Windows  (default:  auto).  It  also  sets
              <b><a href="../man0/SwapInterval.0.html">SwapInterval</a>(0)</b> to ignore the OpenGL timing. Values are: no (disabled), windowed (only in windowed
              mode), yes (also in full screen).

              The  value <b>auto</b> will try to determine whether the compositor is active, and calls <b>DwmFlush</b> only if
              it seems to be.

              This may help to get more consistent frame intervals, especially with high-fps clips - which might
              also reduce dropped frames. Typically, a value of <b>windowed</b> should be enough, since full screen may
              bypass the DWM.

       <b>--angle-d3d11-feature-level=&lt;11_0|10_1|10_0|9_3&gt;</b>
              Selects a specific feature level when using the ANGLE backend with D3D11.  By default, the highest
              available feature level is used. This option can be used to select a lower feature level, which is
              mainly useful for debugging.  Note that OpenGL ES 3.0 is only supported at feature level  10_1  or
              higher.   Most  extended  OpenGL  features  will  not  work  at  lower  feature levels (similar to
              <b>--gpu-dumb-mode</b>).

              Windows with ANGLE only.

       <b>--angle-d3d11-warp=&lt;yes|no|auto&gt;</b>
              Use WARP (Windows Advanced Rasterization  Platform)  when  using  the  ANGLE  backend  with  D3D11
              (default:  auto).  This  is  a high performance software renderer. By default, it is used when the
              Direct3D hardware does not support Direct3D 11  feature  level  9_3.  While  the  extended  OpenGL
              features will work with WARP, they can be very slow.

              Windows with ANGLE only.

       <b>--angle-egl-windowing=&lt;yes|no|auto&gt;</b>
              Use  ANGLE's  built  in EGL windowing functions to create a swap chain (default: auto). If this is
              set to <b>no</b> and the D3D11 renderer is in use, ANGLE's built in swap chain will not  be  used  and  a
              custom swap chain that is optimized for video rendering will be created instead. If set to <b>auto</b>, a
              custom  swap  chain will be used for D3D11 and the built in swap chain will be used for D3D9. This
              option is mainly for debugging purposes, in case the custom swap chain  has  poor  performance  or
              does not work.

              If set to <b>yes</b>, the <b>--angle-flip</b> option will have no effect.

              Windows with ANGLE only.

       <b>--angle-flip=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Enable  flip-model  presentation,  which  avoids  unnecessarily  copying the backbuffer by sharing
              surfaces with the DWM (default: yes). This may cause performance issues  with  older  drivers.  If
              flip-model  presentation is not supported (for example, on Windows 7 without the platform update),
              mpv will automatically fall back to the older bitblt presentation model.

              If set to <b>no</b>, the <b>--angle-swapchain-length</b> option will have no effect.

              Windows with ANGLE only.

       <b>--angle-renderer=&lt;d3d9|d3d11|auto&gt;</b>
              Forces a specific renderer when using the ANGLE backend (default: auto). In auto  mode  this  will
              pick  D3D11  for systems that support Direct3D 11 feature level 9_3 or higher, and D3D9 otherwise.
              This option is mainly for debugging purposes. Normally there is no  reason  to  force  a  specific
              renderer,  though <b>--angle-renderer=d3d9</b> may give slightly better performance on old hardware. Note
              that the D3D9 renderer only supports OpenGL ES 2.0, so most extended OpenGL features will not work
              if this renderer is selected (similar to <b>--gpu-dumb-mode</b>).

              Windows with ANGLE only.

       <b>--macos-force-dedicated-gpu=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Deactivates the automatic graphics switching and forces the dedicated GPU.  (default: no)

              macOS only.

       <b>--cocoa-cb-sw-renderer=&lt;yes|no|auto&gt;</b>
              Use the Apple Software Renderer when using cocoa-cb (default: auto). If set  to  <b>no</b>  the  software
              renderer  is  never used and instead fails when a the usual pixel format could not be created, <b>yes</b>
              will always only use the software renderer, and <b>auto</b> only falls back to the software renderer when
              the usual pixel format couldn't be created.

              macOS and cocoa-cb only.

       <b>--cocoa-cb-10bit-context=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Creates a 10bit capable pixel format for the context creation (default:  yes).   Instead  of  8bit
              integer framebuffer a 16bit half-float framebuffer is requested.

              macOS and cocoa-cb only.

       <b>--cocoa-cb-output-csp=&lt;csp&gt;</b>
              This  sets  the  color space of the layer to activate the macOS color transformation. Depending on
              the color space used the system's EDR (HDR) support will be activated.  To  get  correct  results,
              this  needs  to  be  set  to  the color primaries/transfer characteristics of the VO target. It is
              recommended to use this switch together with <b>--target-trc</b> and <b>--target-prim</b>.

              <b>&lt;csp&gt;</b> can be one of the following:

              <b>auto</b>   Sets the color space to the icc profile of the screen (default).

       <b>--macos-title-bar-color=&lt;color&gt;</b>
              Sets   the   color   of  the  title  bar  (default:  completely  transparent).  Is  influenced  by
              <b>--macos-title-bar-appearance</b> and <b>--macos-title-bar-material</b>.  See <b>--sub-color</b> for color syntax.

       <b>--macos-fs-animation-duration=&lt;default|0-1000&gt;</b>
              Sets the fullscreen resize animation duration in ms (default:  default).   The  default  value  is
              slightly  less  than the system's animation duration (500ms) to prevent some problems when the end
              of an async animation happens at the same time as the end of the system wide fullscreen animation.
              Setting anything higher than 500ms will only prematurely cancel the  resize  animation  after  the
              system wide animation ended. The upper limit is still set at 1000ms since it's possible that Apple
              or  the  user  changes  the system defaults. Anything higher than 1000ms though seems too long and
              shouldn't be set anyway.  (macOS)

       <b>--macos-app-activation-policy=&lt;regular|accessory|prohibited&gt;</b>
              Changes the App activation policy. With accessory  the  mpv  icon  in  the  Dock  can  be  hidden.
              (default: regular)

              macOS only.

       <b>--macos-geometry-calculation=&lt;visible|whole&gt;</b>
              This  changes  the rectangle which is used to calculate the screen position and size of the window
              (default: visible). <b>visible</b> takes the the menu bar and Dock into account and the  window  is  only
              positioned/sized  within  the  visible  screen frame rectangle, <b>whole</b> takes the whole screen frame
              rectangle and ignores the menu bar and Dock. Other previous restrictions  still  apply,  like  the
              window can't be placed on top of the menu bar etc.

              macOS only.

       <b>--macos-render-timer=&lt;timer&gt;</b>
              Sets  the  mode  (default: callback) for syncing the rendering of frames to the display's vertical
              refresh rate.  macOS and Vulkan (macvk) only.

              <b>&lt;timer&gt;</b> can be one of the following:

              <b>callback</b>
                     Syncs to the CVDisplayLink callback

              <b>precise</b>
                     Syncs to the time of the next  vertical  display  refresh  reported  by  the  CVDisplayLink
                     callback provided information

              <b>system</b> No manual syncing, depend on the layer mechanic and the next drawable

              <b>feedback</b>
                     Same as precise but uses the presentation feedback core mechanism

       <b>--macos-menu-shortcuts=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Enables  the  default  menu  bar  shortcuts  (default:  yes).  The  menu bar shortcuts always take
              precedence over any other shortcuts, they are not propagated to the mpv core  and  they  can't  be
              used in config files like <b>input.conf</b> or script bindings.

       <b>--macos-bundle-path=path1,path2,...</b>
              App Bundles operate in their own shell environment that is different from the one in the terminal.
              The  default  PATH variable for all Bundles is <b><a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a>:<a href="file:/bin">/bin</a>:<a href="file:/usr/sbin">/usr/sbin</a>:<a href="file:/sbin">/sbin</a></b>.  Because of that mpv
              can not find binaries installed by package manager that might be used in scripts for example. This
              option prepends all given paths to the default Bundle PATH.

              Default value in following order:

              <b><a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a></b>
                     homebrew (Intel) install path

              <b><a href="file:/usr/local/sbin">/usr/local/sbin</a></b>
                     homebrew (Intel) install path

              <b>/opt/local/bin</b>
                     MacPorts install path

              <b>/opt/local/sbin</b>
                     MacPorts install path

              <b>/opt/homebrew/bin</b>
                     homebrew (ARM) install path

              <b>/opt/homebrew/sbin</b>
                     homebrew (ARM) install path

       <b>--android-surface-size=&lt;WxH&gt;</b>
              Set dimensions of the rendering surface used by the Android gpu context.  Needs to be set  by  the
              embedding application if the dimensions change during runtime (i.e. if the device is rotated), via
              the surfaceChanged callback.

              Android with <b>--gpu-context=android</b> only.

       <b>--gpu-sw</b>
              Continue even if a software renderer is detected. This only works with OpenGL/Vulkan backends. For
              d3d11, see <b>--d3d11-warp</b>.

       <b>--gpu-context=&lt;context1,context2,...[,]&gt;</b>
              Specify  a priority list of the GPU contexts to be used.  The value <b>auto</b> (the default) selects the
              GPU context with the default autoprobe order. You can also pass <b>help</b> to get  a  complete  list  of
              compiled in backends (sorted by the default autoprobe order).

              Note that the default GPU context is subject to change, and must not be relied upon.  If a certain
              GPU context needs to be used, it must be explicitly specified.

              <b>auto</b>   auto-select  (default).  Note that this context must be used alone and does not participate
                     in the priority list.

              <b>win</b>    Win32/WGL

              <b>winvk</b>  VK_KHR_win32_surface

              <b>angle</b>  Direct3D11 through the OpenGL ES translation layer ANGLE. This supports  almost  everything
                     the <b>win</b> backend does (if the ANGLE build is new enough).

              <b>dxinterop</b> <b>(experimental)</b>
                     Win32,  using WGL for rendering and Direct3D 9Ex for presentation. Works on Nvidia and AMD.
                     Newer Intel chips with the latest drivers may also work.

              <b>d3d11</b>  Win32, with native Direct3D 11 rendering.

              <b>x11</b>    X11/GLX (deprecated/legacy, EGL is preferred these days)

              <b>x11vk</b>  VK_KHR_xlib_surface

              <b>wayland</b>
                     Wayland/EGL

              <b>waylandvk</b>
                     VK_KHR_wayland_surface

              <b>drm</b>    DRM/EGL

              <b>displayvk</b>
                     VK_KHR_display. This backend is roughly the Vulkan  equivalent  of  DRM/EGL,  allowing  for
                     direct rendering via Vulkan without a display manager.

              <b>x11egl</b> X11/EGL

              <b>android</b>
                     Android/EGL. Requires <b>--wid</b> be set to an <b>android.view.Surface</b>.

              <b>macvk</b>  Vulkan on macOS with a metal surface through a translation layer (experimental)

              This is an object settings list option. See List Options for details.

       <b>--gpu-api=&lt;type1,type2,...[,]&gt;</b>
              Specify a priority list of accepted graphics APIs.

              <b>auto</b>   Use  any  available  API  (default).  Note  that the default GPU API used for this value is
                     subject to change, and must not be relied upon. If a certain GPU API needs to be  used,  it
                     must be explicitly specified.

              <b>opengl</b> Allow only OpenGL (requires OpenGL 2.1+ or GLES 2.0+)

              <b>vulkan</b> Allow only Vulkan (requires a valid/working <b>--spirv-compiler</b>)

              <b>d3d11</b>  Allow only <b>--gpu-context=d3d11</b>

              This is an object settings list option. See List Options for details.

       <b>--opengl-es=&lt;mode&gt;</b>
              Controls which type of OpenGL context will be accepted:

              <b>auto</b>   Allow all types of OpenGL (default)

              <b>yes</b>    Only allow GLES

              <b>no</b>     Only allow desktop/core GL

       <b>--fbo-format=&lt;fmt&gt;</b>
              Selects  the  internal  format of textures used for FBOs. The format can influence performance and
              quality of the video output. <b>fmt</b> can be one of: rgb8,  rgb10,  rgb10_a2,  rgb16,  rgb16f,  rgb32f,
              rgba12, rgba16, rgba16f, rgba16hf, rgba32f.

              Default:  <b>auto</b>, which first attempts to utilize 16bit float (rgba16f, rgba16hf), and falls back to
              rgba16 if those are not available.  Finally, attempts to utilize rgb10_a2 or rgba8 if all  of  the
              previous formats are not available.

       <b>--gamma-factor=&lt;0.1..2.0&gt;</b>
              Set  an  additional raw gamma factor (default: 1.0). If gamma is adjusted in other ways (like with
              the <b>--gamma</b> option or key bindings and the <b>gamma</b> property), the value is multiplied with the other
              gamma value.

       <b>--gamma-auto</b>
              Automatically corrects the gamma value depending on ambient lighting conditions  (adding  a  gamma
              boost for bright rooms).

              This option is deprecated and may be removed in the future.

              NOTE: Only implemented on macOS and <b>--vo=gpu</b>.

       <b>--image-lut=&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Specifies  a custom LUT file (in Adobe .cube format) to apply to the colors during image decoding.
              The exact interpretation  of  the  LUT  depends  on  the  value  of  <b>--image-lut-type</b>.  (Only  for
              <b>--vo=gpu-next</b>)

       <b>--image-lut-type=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Controls  the  interpretation  of  color  values fed to and from the LUT specified as <b>--image-lut</b>.
              Valid values are:

              <b>auto</b>   Chooses the interpretation of the LUT automatically from  tagged  metadata,  and  otherwise
                     falls back to <b>native</b>. (Default)

              <b>native</b> Applied  to  the  raw  image contents in its native colorspace, before decoding to RGB. For
                     example, for a HDR10 image, this would be fed PQ-encoded YCbCr values in the  range  0.0  -
                     1.0.

              <b>normalized</b>
                     Applied  to  the  normalized  RGB  image  contents,  after  decoding  from its native color
                     encoding, but before linearization.

              <b>conversion</b>
                     Fully replaces the color decoding. A LUT of this type  should  ingest  the  image's  native
                     colorspace and output normalized non-linear RGB.

       <b>--target-colorspace-hint=&lt;auto|yes|no&gt;</b>
              Automatically  configure  the output colorspace of the display to pass through the input values of
              the stream (e.g. for HDR passthrough), if possible. In <b>auto</b> mode, the target  colorspace  is  only
              set,  if  the  display  signals  support  for  HDR  colorspace.   Requires a supporting driver and
              <b>--vo=gpu-next</b>. (Default: <b>no</b>)

       <b>--target-prim=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Specifies the primaries of the display. Video colors will be adapted to this colorspace  when  ICC
              color management is not being used. Valid values are:

              <b>auto</b>   Disable any adaptation, except for atypical color spaces. Specifically, wide/unusual gamuts
                     get  automatically adapted to BT.709, while standard gamut (i.e. BT.601 and BT.709) content
                     is not touched. (default)

              <b>s-log2</b> Sony S-Log2 curve

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 When  using  HDR output formats, mpv will encode to the specified curve but it will not set any
                 HDMI flags or other signalling that might be  required  for  the  target  device  to  correctly
                 display the HDR signal.  The user should independently guarantee this before using these signal
                 formats for display.

       <b>--target-peak=&lt;auto|nits&gt;</b>
              Specifies  the  measured  peak  brightness  of  the  output  display,  in  cd/m^2  (AKA nits). The
              interpretation of this brightness depends on the configured <b>--target-trc</b>. In all cases, it imposes
              a limit on the signal values that will be  sent  to  the  display.  If  the  source  exceeds  this
              brightness level, a tone mapping filter will be inserted. For HLG, it has the additional effect of
              parametrizing  the  inverse  OOTF,  in  order  to get colorimetrically consistent results with the
              mastering display. For SDR, or when using an ICC (profile (<b>--icc-profile</b>), setting this to a value
              above 203 essentially causes the display to be treated as if it were an HDR display  in  disguise.
              (See the note below)

              In  <b>auto</b>  mode (the default), the chosen peak is an appropriate value based on the TRC in use. For
              SDR curves, it uses 203. For HDR curves, it uses 203 * the transfer function's  nominal  peak.  If
              available, it will use the target display's peak brightness as reported by the display.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 When  using  an  SDR transfer function, this is normally not needed, and setting it may lead to
                 very unexpected results. The one time it <u>is</u> useful is if you want to calibrate  a  HDR  display
                 using traditional transfer functions and calibration equipment. In such cases, you can set your
                 HDR  display to a high brightness such as 800 cd/m^2, and then calibrate it to a standard curve
                 like gamma2.8. Setting this value to 800 would then instruct mpv to essentially treat it as  an
                 HDR display with the given peak. This may be a good alternative in environments where PQ or HLG
                 input  to  the  display  is  not  possible,  and makes it possible to use HDR displays with mpv
                 regardless of operating system support for HDMI HDR metadata.

                 In such a configuration, we highly recommend setting <b>--tone-mapping</b> to <b>mobius</b> or even <b>clip</b>.

       <b>--target-contrast=&lt;auto|10-1000000|inf&gt;</b>
              Specifies the measured contrast of the  output  display.  <b>--target-contrast</b>  in  conjunction  with
              <b>--target-peak</b>  value  is  used  to calculate display black point. Used in black point compensation
              during HDR tone-mapping.  <b>auto</b> is the default and assumes 1000:1 contrast as a typical SDR display
              would have or an infinite contrast when HDR <b>--target-trc</b>  is  used.   If  supported  by  the  API,
              display  contrast  will  be  used  as reported.  <b>inf</b> contrast specifies display with perfect black
              level, in practice OLED.  (Only for <b>--vo=gpu-next</b>)

       <b>--target-gamut=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Constrains the gamut of the display. You can use this option to output e.g.  DCIP3-in-BT.2020. Set
              <b>--target-prim</b> to the primaries of the containing colorspace (into which values will  be  encoded),
              and  <b>--target-gamut</b>  to  the  gamut  you  want  to  limit  colors  to.  Takes  the  same values as
              <b>--target-prim</b>. (Only for <b>--vo=gpu-next</b>)

       <b>--target-lut=&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Specifies a custom LUT file (in Adobe  .cube  format)  to  apply  to  the  colors  before  display
              on-screen. This LUT is fed values in normalized RGB, after encoding into the target colorspace, so
              after the application of <b>--target-trc</b>. (Only for <b>--vo=gpu-next</b>)

       <b>--tone-mapping=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Specifies the algorithm used for tone-mapping images onto the target display. This is relevant for
              both  HDR-&gt;SDR  conversion  as  well  as  gamut  reduction (e.g. playing back BT.2020 content on a
              standard gamut display).  Valid values are:

              <b>auto</b>   Maps to <b>bt.2390</b> when using <b>--vo=gpu</b>, and to <b>spline</b> with <b>--vo=gpu-next</b>. (Default)

              <b>clip</b>   Hard-clip any out-of-range values. Use this when you care about perfect color accuracy  for
                     in-range  values  at  the  cost of completely distorting out-of-range values. Not generally
                     recommended.

              <b>mobius</b> Generalization of Reinhard to a  Möbius  transform  with  linear  section.   Smoothly  maps
                     out-of-range  values  while  retaining contrast and colors for in-range material as much as
                     possible. Use this when you care about color accuracy more than detail  preservation.  This
                     is somewhere in between <b>clip</b> and <b>reinhard</b>, depending on the value of <b>--tone-mapping-param</b>.

              <b>reinhard</b>
                     Reinhard  tone  mapping  algorithm.  Very simple continuous curve.  Preserves overall image
                     brightness but uses  nonlinear  contrast,  which  results  in  flattening  of  details  and
                     degradation in color accuracy.

              <b>hable</b>  Similar to <b>reinhard</b> but preserves both dark and bright details better (slightly sigmoidal),
                     at  the  cost  of slightly darkening / desaturating everything. Developed by John Hable for
                     use  in  video  games.  Use  this  when  you  care  about  detail  preservation  more  than
                     color/brightness   accuracy.   This   is   roughly  equivalent  to  <b>--tone-mapping=reinhard</b>
                     <b>--tone-mapping-param=0.24</b>. If possible, you should also enable <b>--hdr-compute-peak</b>  for  the
                     best results.

              <b>st2094-40</b>
                     Dynamic HDR10+ tone-mapping method specified in SMPTE ST2094-40 Annex B. In the absence  of
                     metadata,  falls  back  to  a  fixed  spline matched to the input/output average brightness
                     characteristics. (<b>--vo=gpu-next</b> only)

              <b>st2094-10</b>
                     Dynamic tone-mapping method specified in SMPTE ST2094-10 Annex B.2.   Conceptually  simpler
                     than ST2094-40, and generally produces worse results.

       <b>--tone-mapping-param=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Set  tone mapping parameters. By default, this is set to the special string <b>default</b>, which maps to
              an algorithm-specific default value. Ignored if the tone mapping algorithm is  not  tunable.  This
              affects the following tone mapping algorithms:

              <b>clip</b>   Specifies an extra linear coefficient to multiply into the signal before clipping. Defaults
                     to 1.0.

              <b>mobius</b> Specifies  the  transition  point  from  linear to mobius transform. Every value below this
                     point is guaranteed to be mapped 1:1. The higher the value, the more  accurate  the  result
                     will  be,  at  the  cost  of losing bright details. Defaults to 0.3, which due to the steep
                     initial slope still preserves in-range colors fairly accurately.

              <b>reinhard</b>
                     Specifies the local contrast coefficient at the display peak. Defaults to 0.5, which  means
                     that in-gamut values will be about half as bright as when clipping.

              <b>bt.2390</b>
                     Specifies  the  offset  for the knee point. Defaults to 1.0, which is higher than the value
                     from the original ITU-R specification (0.5).  (<b>--vo=gpu-next</b> only)

              <b>gamma</b>  Specifies the exponent of the function. Defaults to 1.8.

              <b>linear</b> Specifies the scale factor to use while stretching. Defaults to 1.0.

              <b>spline</b> Specifies the knee point (in PQ space). Defaults to 0.30.

              <b>st2094-10</b>
                     Specifies the contrast (slope) at the knee point. Defaults to 1.0.

       <b>--inverse-tone-mapping</b>
              If set, allows inverse tone mapping (expanding SDR to HDR). Not  supported  by  all  tone  mapping
              curves. Use with caution. (<b>--vo=gpu-next</b> only)

       <b>--tone-mapping-max-boost=&lt;1.0..10.0&gt;</b>
              Upper  limit for how much the tone mapping algorithm is allowed to boost the average brightness by
              over-exposing the image. The default value of 1.0 allows no additional brightness boost.  A  value
              of 2.0 would allow over-exposing by a factor of 2, and so on. Raising this setting can help reveal
              details  that  would  otherwise  be  hidden in dark scenes, but raising it too high will make dark
              scenes appear unnaturally bright. (<b>--vo=gpu</b> only)

       <b>--tone-mapping-visualize</b>
              Display a (PQ-PQ) graph of the active tone-mapping LUT. Intended only for debugging purposes.  The
              X  axis  shows PQ input values, the Y axis shows PQ output values. The tone-mapping curve is shown
              in green/yellow. Yellow means the brightness has been boosted from the source, dark  blue  regions
              show  where  the brightness has been reduced. The extra colored regions and lines indicate various
              monitor limits, as well a reference diagonal  (neutral  tone-mapping)  and  source  scene  average
              brightness information (if available). (<b>--vo=gpu-next</b> only)

       <b>--gamut-mapping-mode</b>
              Specifies  the  algorithm  used for reducing the gamut of images for the target display, after any
              tone mapping is done.

              <b>auto</b>   Choose the best mode automatically. (Default)

              <b>clip</b>   Hard-clip to the gamut (per-channel). Very low quality, but free.

              <b>perceptual</b>
                     Performs a perceptually balanced gamut mapping using  a  soft  knee  function  to  roll-off
                     clipped regions, and a hue shifting function to preserve saturation. (<b>--vo=gpu-next</b> only)

              <b>relative</b>
                     Performs  relative  colorimetric  clipping,  while  maintaining an exponential relationship
                     between brightness and chromaticity.  (<b>--vo=gpu-next</b> only)

              <b>saturation</b>
                     Performs simple RGB-&gt;RGB saturation mapping. The input R/G/B channels are  mapped  directly
                     onto the output R/G/B channels. Will never clip, but will distort all hues and/or result in
                     a faded look.  (<b>--vo=gpu-next</b> only)

              <b>absolute</b>
                     Performs absolute colorimetric clipping. Like <b>relative</b>, but does not adapt the white point.
                     (<b>--vo=gpu-next</b> only)

              <b>desaturate</b>
                     Performs  constant-luminance  colorimetric  clipping, desaturing colors towards white until
                     they're in-range.

              <b>darken</b> Uniformly darkens the input slightly to prevent  clipping  on  blown-out  highlights,  then
                     clamps   colorimetrically  to  the  input  gamut  boundary,  biased  slightly  to  preserve
                     chromaticity over luminance.  (<b>--vo=gpu-next</b> only)

              <b>warn</b>   Performs no gamut mapping, but simply highlights out-of-gamut pixels.

              <b>linear</b> Linearly/uniformly desaturates the image in order to bring the entire image into the target
                     gamut. (<b>--vo=gpu-next</b> only)

       <b>--hdr-compute-peak=&lt;auto|yes|no&gt;</b>
              Compute the HDR peak and frame average brightness per-frame instead of relying on tagged metadata.
              These values are averaged over local regions as well as over several frames to prevent  the  value
              from  jittering  around too much. This option basically gives you dynamic, per-scene tone mapping.
              Requires compute shaders, which is a fairly recent OpenGL feature, and will probably also  perform
              horribly  on  some  drivers,  so  enable  at your own risk.  The special value <b>auto</b> (default) will
              enable HDR peak computation automatically if compute shaders and SSBOs are supported.

       <b>--allow-delayed-peak-detect</b>
              When using <b>--hdr-compute-peak</b>, allow delaying the detected peak by a  frame  when  beneficial  for
              performance.  In  particular,  this  is  required  to avoid an unnecessary FBO indirection when no
              advanced rendering is required otherwise. Has no effect if there already is an indirect pass, such
              as when advanced scaling is enabled. Defaults  to  no.  (Only  affects  <b>--vo=gpu-next</b>,  note  that
              <b>--vo=gpu</b> always delays the peak.)

       <b>--hdr-peak-percentile=&lt;0.0..100.0&gt;</b>
              Which  percentile  of  the  input  image  brightness histogram to consider as the true peak of the
              scene. If this is set to 100 (default), the brightest pixel is measured. Otherwise, the top of the
              frequency distribution is progressively cut off. Setting this too low will cause clipping of  very
              bright  details,  but can improve the dynamic brightness range of scenes with very bright isolated
              highlights. Values other than 100 come with a small performance penalty. (Only for <b>--vo=gpu-next</b>)

       <b>--hdr-peak-decay-rate=&lt;0.0..1000.0&gt;</b>
              The decay rate used for the HDR peak detection algorithm (default: 20.0).  This is  only  relevant
              when <b>--hdr-compute-peak</b> is enabled. Higher values make the peak decay more slowly, leading to more
              stable  values  at  the  cost  of  more  "eye adaptation"-like effects (although this is mitigated
              somewhat by <b>--hdr-scene-threshold</b>). A value of 0.0 (the lowest possible) disables  all  averaging,
              meaning  each  frame's  value  is used directly as measured, but doing this is not recommended for
              "noisy" sources since it may lead to excessive flicker. (In signal theory terms, this controls the
              time constant "tau" of an IIR low pass filter)

       <b>--hdr-scene-threshold-low=&lt;0.0..100.0&gt;,</b> <b>--hdr-scene-threshold-high=&lt;0.0..100.0&gt;</b>
              The lower and upper thresholds (in dB) for a brightness difference to be considered a scene change
              (default: 1.0 low, 3.0 high). This is only relevant when <b>--hdr-compute-peak</b> is enabled.  Normally,
              small  fluctuations  in  the frame brightness are compensated for by the peak averaging mechanism,
              but for large jumps in the brightness this can result in the frame remaining  too  bright  or  too
              dark  for  up  to  several seconds, depending on the value of <b>--hdr-peak-decay-rate</b>. To counteract
              this, when the brightness between the running average  and  the  current  frame  exceeds  the  low
              threshold,  mpv  will  make  the  averaging  filter  more  aggressive, up to the limit of the high
              threshold (at which point the filter becomes instant).

       <b>--hdr-contrast-recovery=&lt;0.0..2.0&gt;,</b> <b>--hdr-contrast-smoothness=&lt;1.0..100.0&gt;</b>
              Enables the HDR contrast recovery algorithm, which is to designed to enhance contrast of HDR video
              after tone mapping. The strength (default: 0.0) indicates the degree of  contrast  recovery,  with
              0.0 being completely disabled and 1.0 being 100% strength. Values higher than 1.0 are allowed, but
              may  result  in  excessive sharpening. The smoothness (default: 3.5) indicates the degree to which
              the HDR source is low-passed in order to obtain contrast information - a value of 2.0  corresponds
              to  2x  downscaling.  Users on low DPI displays (&lt;= 100) may want to lower this value, while users
              on very high DPI displays ("retina") may want to increase it. (Only for <b>vo=gpu-next</b>)

       <b>--use-embedded-icc-profile</b>
              Load the embedded ICC profile contained in media files such as PNG images.  (Default:  yes).  Note
              that   this   option  only  works  when  also  using  a  display  ICC  profile  (<b>--icc-profile</b>  or
              <b>--icc-profile-auto</b>), and also requires LittleCMS 2 support.

       <b>--icc-profile=&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Load an ICC profile and use it to transform video RGB to screen output.  Needs LittleCMS 2 support
              compiled in. This option overrides the <b>--target-prim</b>, <b>--target-trc</b> and <b>--icc-profile-auto</b> options.

       <b>--icc-profile-auto</b>
              Automatically select the ICC display profile currently specified by the display  settings  of  the
              operating system.

              NOTE: On Windows, the default profile must be an ICC profile. WCS profiles are not supported.

              Applications   using   libmpv   with   the  render  API  need  to  provide  the  ICC  profile  via
              <b>MPV_RENDER_PARAM_ICC_PROFILE</b>.

       <b>--icc-cache</b>
              Store and load 3DLUTs created from the ICC profile on disk in the cache directory (Default:  <b>yes</b>).
              This  can be used to speed up loading, since LittleCMS 2 can take a while to create a 3D LUT. Note
              that these files contain uncompressed LUTs. Their size depends on the <b>--icc-3dlut-size</b>, and can be
              very big.

              On <u>--vo=gpu-next</u>, files that have not been accessed in the last 24 hours may  be  cleared  if  the
              cache limit (1.5 GiB) is exceeded.

              On  <b>--vo=gpu</b>,  this  is  not  cleaned  automatically,  so old, unused cache files may stick around
              indefinitely.

       <b>--icc-cache-dir</b>
              The directory where icc cache is stored. Cache is stored in the system's cache directory  (usually
              <b><a href="file:~/.cache/mpv">~/.cache/mpv</a></b>) if this is unset.

       <b>--icc-intent=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Specifies the ICC intent used for the color transformation (when using <b>--icc-profile</b>).

              <b>0</b>      perceptual

              <b>1</b>      relative colorimetric (default)

              <b>2</b>      saturation

              <b>3</b>      absolute colorimetric

       <b>--icc-3dlut-size=&lt;auto|RxGxB&gt;</b>
              Size  of the 3D LUT generated from the ICC profile in each dimension. The default of <b>auto</b> means to
              pick the size automatically based on the profile characteristics. Sizes may range from 2 to 512.

              NOTE: Setting this option to anything other than <b>auto</b> is <b>strongly</b> discouraged, except for testing.

       <b>--icc-force-contrast=&lt;no|0-1000000|inf&gt;</b>
              Override the target device's detected contrast ratio  by  a  specific  value.   This  is  detected
              automatically from the profile if possible, but for some profiles it might be missing, causing the
              contrast to be assumed as infinite. As a result, video may appear darker than intended. If this is
              the  case,  setting  this  option might help. This only affects BT.1886 content. The default of <b>no</b>
              means to use the profile values. The special value <b>inf</b> causes the BT.1886 curve to be treated as a
              pure power gamma 2.4 function.

       <b>--icc-use-luma</b>
              Use ICC profile luminance value. (Only for <b>--vo=gpu-next</b>)

       <b>--lut=&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Specifies a custom LUT (in Adobe .cube format) to apply to the colors as part of color conversion.
              The exact interpretation depends on the value of <b>--lut-type</b>. (Only for <b>--vo=gpu-next</b>)

       <b>--lut-type=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Controls the interpretation of color values fed to and from the  LUT  specified  as  <b>--lut</b>.  Valid
              values are:

              <b>auto</b>   Chooses  the  interpretation  of  the LUT automatically from tagged metadata, and otherwise
                     falls back to <b>native</b>. (Default)

              <b>native</b> Applied to raw image contents in its  native  RGB  colorspace  (non-linear  light),  before
                     conversion to the output color space.

              <b>normalized</b>
                     Applied  to  the  normalized  RGB image contents, in linear light, before conversion to the
                     output color space.

              <b>conversion</b>
                     Fully replaces the conversion from the image color space to the output color space. If such
                     a LUT is present, it has the highest priority, and overrides any ICC profiles, as  well  as
                     options related to tone mapping and output colorimetry (<b>--target-prim</b>, <b>--target-trc</b> etc.).

       <b>--blend-subtitles=&lt;yes|video|no&gt;</b>
              Blend  subtitles directly onto upscaled video frames, before interpolation and/or color management
              (default: no). Enabling this causes subtitles to  be  affected  by  <b>--icc-profile</b>,  <b>--target-prim</b>,
              <b>--target-trc</b>,  <b>--interpolation</b>,  <b>--gamma-factor</b>  and  <b>--glsl-shaders</b>.  It  also increases subtitle
              performance when using <b>--interpolation</b>.

              The downside of enabling this is that it restricts subtitles to the visible portion of the  video,
              so you can't have subtitles exist in the black margins below a video (for example).

              If  <b>video</b>  is  selected,  the behavior is similar to <b>yes</b>, but subs are drawn at the video's native
              resolution, and scaled along with the video.

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 This changes the way subtitle colors are handled. Normally, subtitle colors are assumed  to  be
                 in  sRGB  and  color  managed as such. Enabling this makes them treated as being in the video's
                 color space instead. This is good if you want things like softsubbed ASS  signs  to  match  the
                 video colors, but may cause SRT subtitles or similar to look slightly off.

       <b>--background=&lt;none|color|tiles&gt;</b>
              If  the  frame  has  an alpha component, decide what kind of background, if any, to blend it with.
              This does nothing if there is no alpha component.

              <b>color</b>  Blend the frame against the background color (<b>--background-color</b>, normally black).

              <b>tiles</b>  Blend the frame against a 16x16 gray/white tiles background (default).

              <b>none</b>   Do not blend the frame and leave the alpha as is.

              Background transparency on d3d11 requires <b>--d3d11-flip=no</b>.

              Before mpv 0.38.0, this option used to accept a color value specifying the background color.  This
              is now done by the <b>--background-color</b> option.  Use that instead.

       <b>--background-color=&lt;color&gt;</b>
              Color  used  to  draw parts of the mpv window not covered by video. See the <b>--sub-color</b> option for
              how colors are defined.

       <b>--border-background=&lt;none|color|tiles&gt;</b>
              Same as <b>--background</b> but only applies to the black bar/border  area  of  the  window.  <b>vo=gpu-next</b>
              only. Defaults to <b>color</b>.

       <b>--opengl-rectangle-textures</b>
              Force  use  of  rectangle textures (default: no). Normally this shouldn't have any advantages over
              normal textures. Note that hardware decoding overrides this flag. Could be removed any time.

       <b>--gpu-tex-pad-x,</b> <b>--gpu-tex-pad-y</b>
              Enlarge the video source textures by this many pixels. For debugging only (normally  textures  are
              sized  exactly,  but due to hardware decoding interop we may have to deal with additional padding,
              which can be tested with these options). Could be removed any time.

       <b>--opengl-early-flush=&lt;yes|no|auto&gt;</b>
              Call <b>glFlush()</b> after rendering a frame and before attempting to display it  (default:  auto).  Can
              fix stuttering in some cases, in other cases probably causes it. The <b>auto</b> mode will call <b>glFlush()</b>
              only  if  the  renderer is going to wait for a while after rendering, instead of flipping GL front
              and backbuffers immediately (i.e. it doesn't call it in display-sync mode).

              On macOS this is always  deactivated  because  it  only  causes  performance  problems  and  other
              regressions.

       <b>--gpu-dumb-mode=&lt;yes|no|auto&gt;</b>
              This  mode  is  extremely  restricted, and will disable most extended features. That includes high
              quality scalers and custom shaders!

              It is intended for hardware that  does  not  support  FBOs  (including  GLES,  which  supports  it
              insufficiently), or to get some more performance out of bad or old hardware.

              This  mode  is forced automatically if needed, and this option is mostly useful for debugging. The
              default of <b>auto</b> will enable it automatically if nothing uses features which require FBOs.

              This option might be silently removed in the future.

       <b>--gpu-shader-cache</b>
              Store and load compiled GLSL shaders in the  cache  directory  (Default:  <b>yes</b>).  Normally,  shader
              compilation  is very fast, so this is not usually needed. It mostly matters for anything involving
              GLSL to SPIR-V conversion, that is: D3D11, ANGLE or Vulkan, as well as on some  other  proprietary
              drivers. Enabling this can improve startup performance on these platforms.

              On  <u>--vo=gpu-next</u>,  files  that  have not been accessed in the last 24 hours may be cleared if the
              cache limit (128 MiB) is exceeded.

              On <b>--vo=gpu</b>, this is not cleaned automatically, so  old,  unused  cache  files  may  stick  around
              indefinitely.

       <b>--gpu-shader-cache-dir</b>
              The  directory  where  gpu shader cache is stored. Cache is stored in the system's cache directory
              (usually <b><a href="file:~/.cache/mpv">~/.cache/mpv</a></b>) if this is unset.

       <b>--libplacebo-opts=&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;[,&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;[,...]]</b>
              Passes extra raw option to the libplacebo rendering backend (used by <b>--vo=gpu-next</b>). May  override
              the  effects  of any other options set using the normal options system. Requires libplacebo v6.309
              or higher. Included for debugging purposes only. For more information, see:

   <b>Video</b> <b>Sync</b>
       <b>--mc=&lt;seconds/frame&gt;</b>
              Maximum A-V sync correction per frame (in seconds)

       <b>--autosync=&lt;factor&gt;</b>
              Gradually adjusts the A/V sync based on audio delay measurements.   Specifying  <b>--autosync=0</b>,  the
              default,  will  cause  frame  timing  to be based entirely on audio delay measurements. Specifying
              <b>--autosync=1</b> will do the same, but will subtly change the  A/V  correction  algorithm.  An  uneven
              video framerate in a video which plays fine with <b>--audio=no</b> can often be helped by setting this to
              an  integer  value  greater  than  1.  The  higher  the  value,  the  closer the timing will be to
              <b>--audio=no</b>. Try <b>--autosync=30</b> to smooth out problems with sound drivers which do not  implement  a
              perfect  audio delay measurement. With this value, if large A/V sync offsets occur, they will only
              take about 1 or 2 seconds to settle out. This delay in reaction time to sudden A/V offsets  should
              be the only side effect of turning this option on, for all sound drivers.

       <b>--video-timing-offset=&lt;seconds&gt;</b>
              Control  how  long before video display target time the frame should be rendered (default: 0.050).
              If a video frame should be displayed at a certain time, the VO  will  start  rendering  the  frame
              earlier,  and  then  will perform a blocking wait until the display time, and only then "swap" the
              frame to display. The rendering cannot start before the previous frame is displayed, so this value
              is implicitly limited by the video framerate. With normal video frame  rates,  the  default  value
              will  ensure  that rendering is always immediately started after the previous frame was displayed.
              On the other hand, setting a too high value can reduce responsiveness with low FPS value.

              This option is interesting for client API users using the render API because you can stop it  from
              limiting your FPS (see <b>mpv_render_context_render()</b> documentation).

              This   applies   only   to   audio   timing   modes  (e.g.  <b>--video-sync=audio</b>).  In  other  modes
              (<b>--video-sync=display-...</b>), video timing relies on vsync blocking, and this option is not used.

       <b>--video-sync=&lt;audio|...&gt;</b>
              How the player synchronizes audio and video.

              If you use this option, you usually want to set it to <b>display-resample</b> to  enable  a  timing  mode
              that tries to not skip or repeat frames when for example playing 24fps video on a 24Hz screen.

              The  modes  starting  with  <b>display-</b>  try  to  output video frames completely synchronously to the
              display, using the detected display vertical refresh rate as  a  hint  how  fast  frames  will  be
              displayed  on  average.  These  modes  change  video  speed  slightly  to  match  the display. See
              <b>--video-sync-...</b>  options for fine tuning. The robustness of  this  mode  is  further  reduced  by
              making  a  some idealized assumptions, which may not always apply in reality.  Behavior can depend
              on the VO and the system's video and audio drivers.  Media  files  must  use  constant  framerate.
              Section-wise VFR might work as well with some container formats (but not e.g. mkv).

              Under  some  circumstances,  the  player  automatically  reverts  to  <b>audio</b>  mode for some time or
              permanently. This can happen on very low framerate video, or if the framerate cannot be detected.

              Also in display-sync modes it can happen that interruptions to video playback  (such  as  toggling
              fullscreen  mode,  or simply resizing the window) will skip the video frames that should have been
              displayed, while <b>audio</b> mode will display them after the renderer has resumed (typically  resulting
              in a short A/V desync and the video "catching up").

              Before  mpv  0.30.0, there was a fallback to <b>audio</b> mode on severe A/V desync. This was changed for
              the sake of not sporadically stopping. Now, <b>display-desync</b> does what it promises  and  may  desync
              with audio by an arbitrary amount, until it is manually fixed with a seek.

              These  modes  also  require  a  vsync  blocked  presentation  mode. For OpenGL, this translates to
              <b>--opengl-swapinterval=1</b>. For Vulkan, it translates to <b>--vulkan-swap-mode=fifo</b> (or <b>fifo-relaxed</b>).

              The modes with <b>desync</b> in their names do not attempt to keep audio/video in sync. They will  slowly
              (or  quickly)  desync,  until  e.g.  the next seek happens. These modes are meant for testing, not
              serious use.

              <b>audio</b>  Time video frames to audio. This is the most robust mode, because the player  doesn't  have
                     to  assume  anything about how the display behaves. The disadvantage is that it can lead to
                     occasional frame drops or repeats. If audio is disabled, this uses the system  clock.  This
                     is the default mode.

              <b>display-resample</b>
                     Resample  audio  to  match  the  video.  This  mode  will also try to adjust audio speed to
                     compensate for other drift.  (This means it will play the audio at a different speed  every
                     once in a while to reduce the A/V difference.)

              <b>display-resample-vdrop</b>
                     Resample audio to match the video. Drop video frames to compensate for drift.

              <b>display-resample-desync</b>
                     Like the previous mode, but no A/V compensation.

              <b>display-tempo</b>
                     Same  as  <b>display-resample</b>,  but  apply  audio  speed  changes  to audio filters instead of
                     resampling to avoid the change in pitch. Beware that some audio filters don't do well  with
                     a speed close to 1. It is recommend to use a conditional profile to automatically switch to
                     <b>display-resample</b>  when  speed  gets  too  close  to  1  for your filter setup. Use (speed *
                     video_speed_correction) to get the actual playback speed in the condition.  See Conditional
                     auto profiles for details.

              <b>display-vdrop</b>
                     Drop or repeat video frames to compensate desyncing video. (Although  it  should  have  the
                     same effects as <b>audio</b>, the implementation is very different.)

              <b>display-adrop</b>
                     Drop  or repeat audio data to compensate desyncing video. This mode will cause severe audio
                     artifacts if the real monitor refresh rate is too different from  the  reported  or  forced
                     rate. Since mpv 0.33.0, this acts on entire audio frames, instead of single samples.

              <b>display-desync</b>
                     Sync video to display, and let audio play on its own.

              <b>desync</b> Sync video according to system clock, and let audio play on its own.

       <b>--video-sync-max-factor=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Maximum multiple for which to try to fit the video's FPS to the display's FPS (default: 5).

              For  example,  if  this is set to 1, the video FPS is forced to an integer multiple of the display
              FPS, as long as the speed change does not exceed the value set by <b>--video-sync-max-video-change</b>.

              See <b>--interpolation-threshold</b> for how this option affects interpolation.

       <b>--video-sync-max-video-change=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Maximum speed difference in  percent  that  is  applied  to  video  with  <b>--video-sync=display-...</b>
              (default: 1). Display sync mode will be disabled if the monitor and video refresh way do not match
              within  the  given  range. It tries multiples as well: playing 30 fps video on a 60 Hz screen will
              duplicate every second frame. Playing 24 fps video on  a  60  Hz  screen  will  play  video  in  a
              2-3-2-3-... pattern.

              The  default settings are not loose enough to speed up 23.976 fps video to 25 fps. We consider the
              pitch change too extreme to allow this behavior by default. Set this option to a  value  of  <b>5</b>  to
              enable it.

              Note that <b>--video-sync=display-tempo</b> avoids this pitch change.

              Also  note  that  in  the  <b>--video-sync=display-resample</b> or <b>--video-sync=display-tempo</b> mode, audio
              speed  will  additionally  be  changed  by  a  small  amount  if  necessary  for  A/V  sync.   See
              <b>--video-sync-max-audio-change</b>.

       <b>--video-sync-max-audio-change=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Maximum   <u>additional</u>   speed   difference   in   percent   that   is   applied   to   audio   with
              <b>--video-sync=display-...</b> (default: 0.125). Normally, the player plays the audio at  the  speed  of
              the  video.  But if the difference between audio and video position is too high, e.g. due to drift
              or other timing errors, it will attempt to speed up or slow down audio by this additional  factor.
              Too  low  values  could  lead  to  video  frame  dropping or repeating if the A/V desync cannot be
              compensated, too high values could lead to chaotic frame dropping due to the audio  "overshooting"
              and skipping multiple video frames before the sync logic can react.

   <b>Miscellaneous</b>
       <b>--display-tags=tag1,tags2,...</b>
              Set  the  list  of  tags that should be displayed on the terminal and stats.  Tags that are in the
              list, but are not present in the played file, will not be shown. If a value ends with <b>*</b>, all  tags
              are matched by prefix (though there is no general globbing). Just passing <b>*</b> essentially filtering.

              The default includes a common list of tags, call mpv with <b>--list-options</b> to see it.

              This is a string list option. See List Options for details.

       <b>--mf-fps=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Framerate used when decoding from multiple PNG or JPEG files with <b>mf://</b> (default: 1).

       <b>--mf-type=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Input  file  type for <b>mf://</b> (available: jpeg, png, tga, sgi). By default, this is guessed from the
              file extension.

       <b>--stream-dump=&lt;destination-filename&gt;</b>
              Instead of playing a file, read its byte stream and write it to the given  destination  file.  The
              destination is overwritten. Can be useful to test network-related behavior.

       <b>--stream-lavf-o=opt1=value1,opt2=value2,...</b>
              Set  AVOptions  on  streams  opened  with  libavformat. Unknown or misspelled options are silently
              ignored. (They are mentioned in the terminal output in verbose mode, i.e. <b>--v</b>. In general we can't
              print errors, because other options such as e.g. user agent are not available with all  protocols,
              and printing errors for unknown options would end up being too noisy.)

              This is a key/value list option. See List Options for details.

       <b>--backdrop-type=&lt;auto|none|mica|acrylic|mica-alt&gt;</b>
              (Windows only) Controls the backdrop/border style.

              <b>auto</b>   Default Windows behavior

              <b>none</b>   The backdrop will be black or white depending on the system's theme settings.

                     Enables the Acrylic style (frosted glass look).

              <b>mica-alt</b>
                     Same as Mica, except reversed.

       <b>--window-affinity=&lt;default|excludefromcmcapture|monitor&gt;</b>
              (Windows only) Controls the window affinity behavior of mpv.

              <b>default</b>
                     Default Windows behavior

              <b>excludefromcapture</b>
                     mpv's  window  will  be completely excluded from capture by external applications or screen
                     recording software.

              <b>monitor</b>
                     Blacks out the mpv window

       <b>--vo-mmcss-profile=&lt;name&gt;</b>
              (Windows only) Set the MMCSS profile for the video renderer thread (default: <b>Playback</b>).

       <b>--priority=&lt;prio&gt;</b>
              (Windows only) Set process priority for mpv according to the predefined priorities available under
              Windows.

              Possible values of <b>&lt;prio&gt;</b>: idle|belownormal|normal|abovenormal|high|realtime

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 Using realtime priority can cause system lockup.

       <b>--media-controls=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              (Windows  only)  Enable  integration  of  media  control  interface  SystemMediaTransportControls.
              Default: yes (except for libmpv)

       <b>--force-media-title=&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Force the contents of the <b>media-title</b> property to this value. Useful for scripts which want to set
              a title, without overriding the user's setting in <b>--title</b>.

       <b>--external-files=&lt;file-list&gt;</b>
              Load  a  file  and  add  all  of  its tracks. This is useful to play different files together (for
              example audio from one file, video from another),  or  for  advanced  <b>--lavfi-complex</b>  used  (like
              playing two video files at the same time).

              Unlike  <b>--sub-files</b> and <b>--audio-files</b>, this includes all tracks, and does not cause default stream
              selection over the "proper" file. This makes it  slightly  less  intrusive.  (In  mpv  0.28.0  and
              before, this was not quite strictly enforced.)

              This is a path list option. See List Options for details.

       <b>--external-file=&lt;file&gt;</b>
              CLI/config  file  only  alias  for <b>--external-files-append</b>. Each use of this option will add a new
              external file.

       <b>--cover-art-files=&lt;file-list&gt;</b>
              Use an external file as cover art while playing audio. This makes it appear on the track list  and
              subject to automatic track selection. Options like <b>--audio-display</b> control whether such tracks are
              supposed to be selected.

              (The  difference  to  loading  a file with <b>--external-files</b> is that video tracks will be marked as
              being pictures, which affects the auto-selection method. If the passed file is a video,  only  the
              first frame will be decoded and displayed. Enabling the cover art track during playback may show a
              random  frame  if  the source file is a video. Normally you're not supposed to pass videos to this
              option, so this paragraph describes the  behavior  coincidentally  resulting  from  implementation
              details.)

              This is a path list option. See List Options for details.

       <b>--cover-art-file=&lt;file&gt;</b>
              CLI/config  file  only  alias for <b>--cover-art-files-append</b>. Each use of this option will add a new
              external file.

       <b>--cover-art-auto=&lt;no|exact|fuzzy|all&gt;</b>
              Whether to load _external_ cover art automatically. Similar to <b>--sub-auto</b>  and  <b>--audio-file-auto</b>.
              If  a video already has tracks (which are not marked as cover art), external cover art will not be
              loaded.

              <b>no</b>     Don't automatically load cover art.

              <b>exact</b>  Load the media filename with an image file extension (default).

              <b>fuzzy</b>  Load all cover art containing the media filename.

              <b>all</b>    Load all images in the current directory.

              See <b>--cover-art-files</b> for details about what constitutes cover art.

              See <b>--audio-display</b> how to control display of cover art (this can be used  to  disable  cover  art
              that is part of the file).

       <b>--image-exts=ext1,ext2,...</b>
              Image  file  extensions  to  try  to  match  when using <b>--cover-art-auto</b>, <b>--autocreate-playlist</b> or
              <b>--directory-filter-types</b>.

              This is a string list option. See List Options for details.  Use <b>--help=image-exts</b> to see  default
              extensions.

       <b>--cover-art-whitelist=filename1,filename2,...</b>
              Filenames  to  load  as  cover  art,  sorted  by  descending  priority. They are combined with the
              extensions in <b>--image-exts</b>. This has no effect if <b>cover-art-auto</b> is <b>no</b>.

              Default: <b>AlbumArt,Album,cover,front,AlbumArtSmall,Folder,.folder,thumb</b>

              This is a string list option. See List Options for details.

       <b>--video-exts=ext1,ext2,...</b>
              Video   file   extensions   to   try   to    match    when    using    <b>--autocreate-playlist</b>    or
              <b>--directory-filter-types</b>.

              This  is a string list option. See List Options for details.  Use <b>--help=video-exts</b> to see default
              extensions.

       <b>--archive-exts=ext1,ext2,...</b>
              Archive   file   extensions   to   try   to   match   when    using    <b>--autocreate-playlist</b>    or
              <b>--directory-filter-types</b>.

              This  is  a  string  list option. See List Options for details. Use <b>--help=archive-exts</b> to see the
              default extensions.

       <b>--playlist-exts=ext1,ext2,...</b>
              Playlist   file   extensions   to   try   to   match   when   using    <b>--autocreate-playlist</b>    or
              <b>--directory-filter-types</b>.

              This  is  a  string list option. See List Options for details. Use <b>--help=playlist-exts</b> to see the
              default extensions.

       <b>--autoload-files=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Automatically load/select external files (default: yes).

              If set to <b>no</b>,  then  do  not  automatically  load  external  files  as  specified  by  <b>--sub-auto</b>,
              <b>--audio-file-auto</b>   and  <b>--cover-art-auto</b>.  If  external  files  are  forcibly  added  (like  with
              <b>--sub-files</b>), they will not be auto-selected.

              This does not affect playlist expansion, redirection, or other loading of  referenced  files  like
              with ordered chapters.

       <b>--stream-record=&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Write received/read data from the demuxer to the given output file. The output file will always be
              overwritten without asking. The output format is determined by the extension of the output file.

              Switching  streams  or  seeking  during  recording  might result in recording being stopped and/or
              broken files. Use with care.

              Seeking outside of the demuxer cache will result in "skips" in the output file, but seeking within
              the demuxer cache should not affect recording. One exception is when you seek back far  enough  to
              exceed  the  forward  buffering  size,  in  which case the cache stops actively reading. This will
              return in dropped data if it's a live stream.

              If this is set at runtime, the old file is closed, and the new file is opened. Note that this will
              write only data that is appended at the end of the cache, and the already cached  data  cannot  be
              written. You can try the <b>dump-cache</b> command as an alternative.

              External  files  (<b>--audio-file</b>  etc.) are ignored by this, it works on the "main" file only. Using
              this with files using ordered chapters or EDL files will also not work correctly in general.

              There are some glitches with this because it uses FFmpeg's  libavformat  for  writing  the  output
              file.  For  example,  it's  typical that it will only work if the output format is the same as the
              input format. This is the case even if it works with the <b>ffmpeg</b> tool. One reason for this is  that
              <b>ffmpeg</b>  and  its  libraries  contain  certain  hacks  and  workarounds  for these issues, that are
              unavailable to outside users.

       <b>--lavfi-complex=&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Set a "complex" libavfilter filter, which means a single filter graph can take input from multiple
              source audio and video tracks. The graph can result in a single audio or video output (or both).

              Currently, the filter graph  labels  are  used  to  select  the  participating  input  tracks  and
              audio/video output. The following rules apply:

              • A label of the form <b>aidN</b> selects audio track N as input (e.g.  <b>aid1</b>).

              • A label of the form <b>vidN</b> selects video track N as input.

              • A label named <b>ao</b> will be connected to the audio output.

              • A label named <b>vo</b> will be connected to the video output.

              Each  label  can  be used only once. If you want to use e.g. an audio stream for multiple filters,
              you need to use the <b>asplit</b> filter. Multiple video or audio outputs are not possible, but  you  can
              use filters to merge them into one.

              It's  not  possible to change the tracks connected to the filter at runtime, unless you explicitly
              change the <b>lavfi-complex</b> property and set new track assignments. When the graph  is  changed,  the
              track selection is changed according to the used labels as well.

              Other  tracks, as long as they're not connected to the filter, and the corresponding output is not
              connected to the filter, can still be freely changed with the normal methods.

              Note that the normal filter chains (<b>--af</b>, <b>--vf</b>) are applied between the complex  graphs  (e.g.  <b>ao</b>
              label) and the actual output.

                 Examples

                 • <b>--lavfi-complex='[aid1]</b> <b>[aid2]</b> <b>amix</b> <b>[ao]'</b> Play audio track 1 and 2 at the same time.

                 • <b>--lavfi-complex='[vid1]</b>  <b>[vid2]</b>  <b>vstack</b>  <b>[vo]'</b> Stack video track 1 and 2 and play them at the
                   same time. Note that both tracks need to have the same width, or filter  initialization  will
                   fail  (you  can add <b>scale</b> filters before the <b>vstack</b> filter to fix the size).  To load a video
                   track from another file, you can use <b>--external-file=other.mkv</b>.

                 • <b>--lavfi-complex='[vid1]</b> <b>[vid2]</b> <b>[vid3]</b> <b>hstack=inputs=3</b> <b>[vo]'</b> Use the inputs  option  to  stack
                   more than 2 tracks.

                 • <b>--lavfi-complex='[aid1]</b>  <b>asplit</b>  <b>[t1]</b> <b>[ao]</b> <b>;</b> <b>[t1]</b> <b>showvolume</b> <b>[t2]</b> <b>;</b> <b>[vid1]</b> <b>[t2]</b> <b>overlay</b> <b>[vo]'</b>
                   Play audio track 1, and overlay the measured volume for each speaker over video track 1.

              See the FFmpeg libavfilter documentation for details on the available filters.

       <b>--metadata-codepage=&lt;codepage&gt;</b>
              Codepage for various input metadata (default: <b>auto</b>). This affects how file tags,  chapter  titles,
              etc.  are  interpreted.  In  most cases, this merely evaluates to UTF-8 as non-UTF-8 codepages are
              obscure.

              See  <b>--sub-codepage</b>  option  on  how  codepages  are  specified  and  further  details   regarding
              autodetection and codepage conversion. (The underlying code is the same.)

              Conversion is not applied to metadata that is updated at runtime.

       <b>--clipboard-backends=&lt;backend1,backend2,...[,]&gt;</b>
              Specify  a  priority  list  of the clipboard backends to be used.  You can also pass <b>help</b> to get a
              complete list of compiled in backends.

              If the list is not empty, it enables native clipboard support for  the  specified  backends.  This
              allows reading and writing to the <b>clipboard</b> property to get and set clipboard contents.

              Native  clipboard support is enabled by default. To disable this, remove all backends in this list
              with <b>--clipboard-backends-clr</b>.

              Note that the default clipboard backends are subject to change, and must not be relied upon.

              The following clipboard backends are implemented:

              <b>win32</b>  Windows backend.

              <b>mac</b>    macOS backend.

              <b>wayland</b>
                     Wayland  backend.  This  backend  is  only  available  if  the  compositor   supports   the
                     <b>ext-data-control-v1</b> protocol.

              <b>vo</b>     VO  backend. Requires an active VO window, and support differs across platforms. Currently,
                     this  is  used  as  a  fallback  for  Wayland   compositors   without   support   for   the
                     <b>ext-data-control-v1</b> protocol, or if the <b>wayland</b> backend is disabled.

              This is an object settings list option. See List Options for details.

       <b>--clipboard-monitor=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              (Windows, Wayland and macOS only)

              Enable  clipboard  monitoring  so  that the <b>clipboard</b> property can be observed for content changes
              (default: no). This only affects clipboard implementations which use polling to monitor  clipboard
              updates.  Other platforms currently ignore this option and always/never notify changes.

              On  Wayland,  this  option only has effect on the <b>wayland</b> backend, and not for the <b>vo</b> backend. See
              <b>current-clipboard-backend</b> property for more details.

</pre><h4><b>AUDIO</b> <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>DRIVERS</b></h4><pre>
       Audio output drivers are interfaces to different audio output facilities. The syntax is:

       <b>--ao=&lt;driver1,driver2,...[,]&gt;</b>
              Specify a priority list of audio output drivers to be used.

       If the list has a trailing ',', mpv will fall back on drivers not contained in the list.

       This is an object settings list option. See List Options for details.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          See <b>--ao=help</b> for a list of compiled-in audio output drivers sorted by autoprobe order.

          Note that the default audio output driver is subject to change, and must not  be  relied  upon.  If  a
          certain AO needs to be used, it must be explicitly specified.

       Available audio output drivers are:

       <b>alsa</b>   ALSA audio output driver.

              The following global options are supported by this audio output:

              <b>--alsa-resample=yes</b>
                     Enable  ALSA  resampling  plugin. (This is disabled by default, because some drivers report
                     incorrect audio delay in some cases.)

              <b>--alsa-mixer-device=&lt;device&gt;</b>
                     Set the mixer device used with <b>ao-volume</b> (default: <b>default</b>).

              <b>--alsa-mixer-name=&lt;name&gt;</b>
                     Set the name of the mixer element (default: <b>Master</b>). This is for example <b>PCM</b> or <b>Master</b>.

              <b>--alsa-mixer-index=&lt;number&gt;</b>
                     Set the index of the mixer channel (default: 0). Consider the output of "<b>amixer</b> <b>scontrols</b>",
                     then the index is the number that follows the name of the element.

              <b>--alsa-non-interleaved</b>
                     Allow output of non-interleaved formats (if the audio decoder uses this format).  Currently
                     disabled   by   default,  because  some  popular  ALSA  plugins  are  utterly  broken  with
                     non-interleaved formats.

              <b>--alsa-ignore-chmap</b>
                     Don't read or set the channel map of the ALSA device - only request the required number  of
                     channels,  and then pass the audio as-is to it. This option most likely should not be used.
                     It can be useful for debugging, or for static  setups  with  a  specially  engineered  ALSA
                     configuration  (in this case you should always force the same layout with <b>--audio-channels</b>,
                     or it will work only for files which use the layout implicit to your ALSA device).

              <b>--alsa-buffer-time=&lt;microseconds&gt;</b>
                     Set the requested buffer time in microseconds. A value of 0 skips requesting anything  from
                     the  ALSA  API.  This and the <b>--alsa-periods</b> option uses the ALSA <b>near</b> functions to set the
                     requested parameters. If doing so results in an  empty  configuration  set,  setting  these
                     parameters is skipped.

                     Both  options  control  the buffer size. A low buffer size can lead to higher CPU usage and
                     audio dropouts, while a high buffer size can lead to higher latency in volume  changes  and
                     other filtering.

              <b>--alsa-periods=&lt;number&gt;</b>
                     Number of periods requested from the ALSA API. See <b>--alsa-buffer-time</b> for further remarks.

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 To  get  multichannel/surround audio, use <b>--audio-channels=auto</b>. The default for this option is
                 <b>auto-safe</b>, which makes this audio output explicitly reject multichannel output, as there is  no
                 way to detect whether a certain channel layout is actually supported.

                 You  can also try using the upmix plugin &lt;https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/wiki/ALSA-Surround-
                 Sound-and-Upmixing&gt; .  This setup  enables  multichannel  audio  on  the  <b>default</b>  device  with
                 automatic  upmixing  with  shared  access, so playing stereo and multichannel audio at the same
                 time will work as expected.

       <b>oss</b>    OSS audio output driver

       <b>jack</b>   JACK (Jack Audio Connection Kit) audio output driver.

              The following global options are supported by this audio output:

              <b>--jack-port=&lt;name&gt;</b>
                     Connects to the ports with the given name (default: physical ports).

              <b>--jack-name=&lt;client&gt;</b>
                     Client name that is passed to JACK (default: <b>mpv</b>). Useful  if  you  want  to  have  certain
                     connections established automatically.

              <b>--jack-autostart=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
                     Automatically  start  jackd  if  necessary  (default: disabled). Note that this tends to be
                     unreliable and will flood stdout with server messages.

              <b>--jack-connect=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
                     Automatically create connections to output ports (default:  enabled).   When  enabled,  the
                     maximum number of output channels will be limited to the number of available output ports.

              <b>--jack-std-channel-layout=&lt;waveext|any&gt;</b>
                     Select the standard channel layout (default: waveext). JACK itself has no notion of channel
                     layouts  (i.e.  assigning  which  speaker  a given channel is supposed to map to) - it just
                     takes whatever the application outputs, and reroutes it to whatever the user defines.  This
                     means  the  user  and  the  application  are  in charge of dealing with the channel layout.
                     <b>waveext</b> uses WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE order, which, even though it was defined by  Microsoft,
                     is  the  standard on many systems.  The value <b>any</b> makes JACK accept whatever comes from the
                     audio filter chain, regardless of channel layout  and  without  reordering.  This  mode  is
                     probably not very useful, other than for debugging or when used with fixed setups.

       <b>coreaudio</b> <b>(macOS</b> <b>only)</b>
              Native macOS audio output driver using AudioUnits and the CoreAudio sound server.

              Automatically redirects to <b>coreaudio_exclusive</b> when playing compressed formats.

              The following global options are supported by this audio output:

              <b>--coreaudio-change-physical-format=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
                     Change the physical format to one similar to the requested audio format (default: no). This
                     has  the  advantage  that multichannel audio output will actually work. The disadvantage is
                     that it will change the system-wide audio settings. This  is  equivalent  to  changing  the
                     <b>Format</b>  setting in the <b>Audio</b> <b>Devices</b> dialog in the <b>Audio</b> <b>MIDI</b> <b>Setup</b> utility. Note that this
                     does not affect the selected speaker setup.

              <b>--coreaudio-spdif-hack=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
                     Try to pass through AC3/DTS data as PCM. This is useful for drivers which do not report AC3
                     support. It converts the AC3 data to float, and assumes the  driver  will  do  the  inverse
                     conversion, which means a typical A/V receiver will pick it up as compressed IEC framed AC3
                     stream, ignoring that it's marked as PCM. This disables normal AC3 passthrough (even if the
                     device reports it as supported). Use with extreme care.

       <b>coreaudio_exclusive</b> <b>(macOS</b> <b>only)</b>
              Native macOS audio output driver using direct device access and exclusive mode (bypasses the sound
              server).

       <b>avfoundation</b> <b>(macOS</b> <b>only)</b>
              Native macOS audio output driver using <b>AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer</b> in AVFoundation, which supports
              spatial audio &lt;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211775&gt; .

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 Turning  on spatial audio may hang the playback if mpv is not started out of the bundle, though
                 playback with spatial audio off always works.

       <b>audiounit</b> <b>(iOS</b> <b>only)</b>
              Native iOS audio output driver using <b>AudioUnits</b> and AudioToolbox.

       <b>openal</b> OpenAL audio output driver.

              <b>--openal-num-buffers=&lt;2-128&gt;</b>
                     Specify the number of audio buffers to use. Lower values are better for  lower  CPU  usage.
                     Default: 4.

              <b>--openal-num-samples=&lt;256-32768&gt;</b>
                     Specify the number of complete samples to use for each buffer. Higher values are better for

              <b>--openal-direct-channels=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
                     Enable  OpenAL  Soft's  direct  channel extension when available to avoid tinting the sound

       <b>pulse</b>  PulseAudio audio output driver

              The following global options are supported by this audio output:

              <b>--pulse-host=&lt;host&gt;</b>
                     Specify the host to use. An empty &lt;host&gt; string uses a local connection,  "localhost"  uses
                     network transfer (most likely not what you want).

              <b>--pulse-buffer=&lt;1-2000|native&gt;</b>
                     Set  the  audio  buffer  size  in milliseconds. A higher value buffers more data, and has a
                     lower probability of buffer underruns. A smaller value makes the audio stream react faster,
                     e.g. to playback speed changes. "native" lets the sound server determine buffers.

              <b>--pulse-latency-hacks=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
                     Enable hacks to workaround PulseAudio timing bugs (default: yes). If enabled, mpv  will  do
                     elaborate   latency   calculations  on  its  own.  If  disabled,  it  will  use  PulseAudio
                     automatically updated timing information. Disabling this might  help  with  e.g.  networked
                     audio  or  some  plugins,  while  enabling  it might help in some unknown situations (it is
                     currently enabled due to known bugs with PulseAudio 16.0).

              <b>--pulse-allow-suspended=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
                     Allow mpv to use PulseAudio even if the sink is suspended (default: no).  Can be useful  if
                     PulseAudio is running as a bridge to jack and mpv has its sink-input set to the one jack is
                     using.

       <b>pipewire</b>
              PipeWire audio output driver

              The following global options are supported by this audio output:

              <b>--pipewire-buffer=&lt;1-2000|native&gt;</b>
                     Set  the  audio  buffer  size  in milliseconds. A higher value buffers more data, and has a
                     lower probability of buffer underruns. A smaller value makes the audio stream react faster,
                     e.g. to playback speed changes. "native" lets the sound server determine buffers.

              <b>--pipewire-remote=&lt;remote&gt;</b>
                     Specify the PipeWire remote daemon name to connect to via local  UNIX  sockets.   An  empty
                     &lt;remote&gt; string uses the default remote named <b>pipewire-0</b>.

              <b>--pipewire-volume-mode=&lt;channel|global&gt;</b>
                     Specify if the <b>ao-volume</b> property should apply to the channel volumes or the global volume.
                     By default the channel volumes are used.

       <b>sdl</b>    SDL  2.0+  audio  output driver. Should work on any platform supported by SDL 2.0, but may require
              the <b>SDL_AUDIODRIVER</b> environment variable to be set appropriately for your system.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This driver is for compatibility with extremely foreign environments,  such  as  systems  where
                 none of the other drivers are available.

              The following global options are supported by this audio output:

              <b>--sdl-buflen=&lt;length&gt;</b>
                     Sets  the  audio  buffer  length  in  seconds.  Is used only as a hint by the sound system.
                     Playing a file with <b>-v</b> will show the requested and obtained exact buffer size. A value of 0
                     selects the sound system default.

       <b>null</b>   Produces  no  audio  output  but  maintains  video  playback  speed.   You   can   use   <b>--ao=null</b>
              <b>--ao-null-untimed</b> for benchmarking.

              The following global options are supported by this audio output:

              <b>--ao-null-untimed</b>
                     Do not simulate timing of a perfect audio device. This means audio decoding will go as fast
                     as possible, instead of timing it to the system clock.

              <b>--ao-null-buffer</b>
                     Simulated buffer length in seconds.

              <b>--ao-null-outburst</b>
                     Simulated chunk size in samples.

              <b>--ao-null-speed</b>
                     Simulated  audio  playback  speed as a multiplier. Usually, a real audio device will not go
                     exactly as fast as the system clock. It will deviate just a little, and this  option  helps
                     to simulate this.

              <b>--ao-null-latency</b>
                     Simulated device latency. This is additional to EOF.

              <b>--ao-null-broken-eof</b>
                     Simulate  broken  audio  drivers, which always add the fixed device latency to the reported
                     audio playback position.

              <b>--ao-null-broken-delay</b>
                     Simulate broken audio drivers, which don't report latency correctly.

              <b>--ao-null-channel-layouts</b>
                     If not empty, this is a <b>,</b> separated list of channel layouts the AO allows. This can be used
                     to test channel layout selection.

              <b>--ao-null-format</b>
                     Force the audio output format the AO will accept. If unset accepts any.

       <b>pcm</b>    Raw PCM/WAVE file writer audio output

              The following global options are supported by this audio output:

              <b>--ao-pcm-waveheader=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
                     Include or do not include the WAVE header (default: included). When not included,  raw  PCM
                     will be generated.

              <b>--ao-pcm-file=&lt;filename&gt;</b>
                     Write  the  sound  to  <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> instead of the default <b>audiodump.wav</b>. If <b>no-waveheader</b> is
                     specified, the default is <b>audiodump.pcm</b>.

              <b>--ao-pcm-append=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
                     Append to the file, instead of overwriting it.  Always  use  this  with  the  <b>no-waveheader</b>
                     option  -  with  <b>waveheader</b> it's broken, because it will write a WAVE header every time the
                     file is opened.

       <b>sndio</b>  Audio output to the OpenBSD sndio sound system

              (Note: only supports mono, stereo, 4.0, 5.1 and 7.1 channel layouts.)

       <b>wasapi</b> Audio output to the Windows Audio Session API.

              The following global options are supported by this audio output:

              <b>--wasapi-exclusive-buffer=&lt;default|min|1-2000000&gt;</b>
                     Set buffer duration in exclusive mode (i.e., with <b>--audio-exclusive=yes</b>). <b>default</b>  and  <b>min</b>
                     use  the  default  and minimum device period reported by WASAPI, respectively. You can also
                     directly specify the buffer duration in microseconds, in which case a duration shorter than
                     the minimum device period will be rounded up to the minimum period.

                     The default buffer duration should provide robust playback in most cases, but reportedly on
                     some devices there are glitches following stream resets under the default setting. In  such
                     cases, specifying a shorter duration might help.

</pre><h4><b>VIDEO</b> <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>DRIVERS</b></h4><pre>
       Video output drivers are interfaces to different video output facilities. The syntax is:

       <b>--vo=&lt;driver1,driver2,...[,]&gt;</b>
              Specify a priority list of video output drivers to be used.

       If the list has a trailing <b>,</b>, mpv will fall back on drivers not contained in the list.

       This is an object settings list option. See List Options for details.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          See <b>--vo=help</b> for a list of compiled-in video output drivers.

          The  recommended  output  driver  is  <b>--vo=gpu</b>,  which  is  the  default.  All  other  drivers are for
          compatibility or special purposes. If the default does not work, it will fallback to other drivers (in
          the same order as listed by <b>--vo=help</b>).

          Note that the default video output driver is subject to change, and must not  be  relied  upon.  If  a
          certain VO needs to be used (e.g. for <b>libmpv</b> rendering API), it must be explicitly specified.

       Available video output drivers are:

       <b>gpu</b>    General  purpose,  customizable, GPU-accelerated video output driver. It supports extended scaling
              methods, dithering, color management, custom shaders, HDR, and more.

              See GPU renderer options for options specific to this VO.

              By default, mpv utilizes  settings  that  balance  quality  and  performance.   Additionally,  two
              predefined  profiles  are  available:  <b>fast</b>  for maximum performance and <b>high-quality</b> for superior
              rendering quality. You can apply a specific profile using the <b>--profile=&lt;name&gt;</b> option and  inspect
              its contents using <b>--show-profile=&lt;name&gt;</b>.

              This  VO  abstracts  over  several  possible  graphics  APIs  and windowing contexts, which can be
              influenced using the <b>--gpu-api</b> and <b>--gpu-context</b> options.

              Hardware decoding over OpenGL-interop is supported to some degree. Note that in  this  mode,  some
              corner  case  might not be gracefully handled, and color space conversion and chroma upsampling is
              generally in the hand of the hardware decoder APIs.

              <b>gpu</b> makes use of FBOs by default. Sometimes you can  achieve  better  quality  or  performance  by
              changing  the  <b>--fbo-format</b> option to <b>rgb16f</b>, <b>rgb32f</b> or <b>rgb</b>. Known problems include Mesa/Intel not
              accepting <b>rgb16</b>, Mesa sometimes not being compiled with float  texture  support,  and  some  macOS
              setups  being  very  slow  with <b>rgb16</b> but fast with <b>rgb32f</b>. If you have problems, you can also try
              enabling the <b>--gpu-dumb-mode=yes</b> option.

       <b>gpu-next</b>
              Experimental video renderer based on <b>libplacebo</b>. This supports almost the same set of features  as
              <b>--vo=gpu</b>. See GPU renderer options for a list.

              Should  generally  be  faster  and  higher  quality,  but  some  features  may still be missing or
              misbehave. Expect (and report!) bugs. See here for a list of known differences and bugs:

               &lt;https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/wiki/GPU-Next-vs-GPU&gt;

       <b>xv</b> <b>(X11</b> <b>only)</b>
              Uses the XVideo extension to enable hardware-accelerated display. This is the most  compatible  VO
              on X, but may be low-quality, and has issues with OSD and subtitle display.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This driver is for compatibility with old systems.

              The following global options are supported by this video output:

              <b>--xv-adaptor=&lt;number&gt;</b>
                     Select a specific XVideo adapter (check xvinfo results).

              <b>--xv-port=&lt;number&gt;</b>
                     Select a specific XVideo port.

              <b>--xv-ck=&lt;cur|use|set&gt;</b>
                     Select the source from which the color key is taken (default: cur).

                     <b>cur</b>    The default takes the color key currently set in Xv.

                     <b>use</b>    Use but do not set the color key from mpv (use the <b>--colorkey</b> option to change it).

                     <b>set</b>    Same as use but also sets the supplied color key.

              <b>--xv-ck-method=&lt;none|man|bg|auto&gt;</b>
                     Sets the color key drawing method (default: man).

                     <b>none</b>   Disables color-keying.

                     <b>man</b>    Draw the color key manually (reduces flicker in some cases).

                     <b>bg</b>     Set the color key as window background.

                     <b>auto</b>   Let Xv draw the color key.

              <b>--xv-colorkey=&lt;number&gt;</b>
                     Changes  the  color  key  to an RGB value of your choice. <b>0x000000</b> is black and <b>0xffffff</b> is
                     white.

              <b>--xv-buffers=&lt;number&gt;</b>
                     Number of image buffers to use for the internal ringbuffer (default: 2).   Increasing  this
                     will  use  more  memory,  but might help with the X server not responding quickly enough if
                     video FPS is close to or higher than the display refresh rate.

       <b>x11</b> <b>(X11</b> <b>only)</b>
              Shared memory video output driver  without  hardware  acceleration  that  works  whenever  X11  is
              present.

              Since mpv 0.30.0, you may need to use <b>--profile=sw-fast</b> to get decent performance.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This is a fallback only, and should not be normally used.

       <b>vdpau</b> <b>(X11</b> <b>only)</b>
              Uses  the  VDPAU interface to display and optionally also decode video.  Hardware decoding is used
              with <b>--hwdec=vdpau</b>. Note that there is absolutely no reason to use this, other than compatibility.
              We strongly recommend that you use <b>--vo=gpu</b> with <b>--hwdec=nvdec</b> instead.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Earlier  versions  of  mpv  (and  MPlayer,  mplayer2)  provided  sub-options  to   tune   vdpau
                 post-processing,   like   <b>deint</b>,  <b>sharpen</b>,  <b>denoise</b>,  <b>chroma-deint</b>,  <b>pullup</b>,  <b>hqscaling</b>.  These
                 sub-options are deprecated, and you should use the <b>vdpaupp</b> video filter instead.

              The following global options are supported by this video output:

              <b>--vo-vdpau-sharpen=&lt;-1-1&gt;</b>
                     (Deprecated. See note about <b>vdpaupp</b>.)

                     For positive values, apply a sharpening algorithm to  the  video,  for  negative  values  a
                     blurring algorithm (default: 0).

              <b>--vo-vdpau-denoise=&lt;0-1&gt;</b>
                     (Deprecated. See note about <b>vdpaupp</b>.)

                     Apply a noise reduction algorithm to the video (default: 0; no noise reduction).

              <b>--vo-vdpau-chroma-deint</b>
                     (Deprecated. See note about <b>vdpaupp</b>.)

                     Makes   temporal   deinterlacers   operate   both   on  luma  and  chroma  (default).   Use
                     no-chroma-deint to solely use luma and speed up advanced deinterlacing.  Useful  with  slow
                     video memory.

              <b>--vo-vdpau-pullup</b>

                     allow video playback rates higher than display refresh  rate,  and  for  vsync-aware  frame
                     timing  adjustments).  Default  0  means  use  autodetected  value.  A  positive  value  is
                     interpreted as a refresh rate in Hz and overrides the autodetected value. A negative  value
                     disables all timing adjustment and framedrop logic.

              <b>--vo-vdpau-composite-detect</b>
                     NVIDIA's  current  VDPAU  implementation  behaves  somewhat differently under a compositing
                     window manager and does not give  accurate  frame  timing  information.  With  this  option
                     enabled,  the player tries to detect whether a compositing window manager is active. If one
                     is detected, the player disables timing adjustments as if the user had specified <b>fps=-1</b> (as
                     they would be based on incorrect input). This means timing is somewhat less  accurate  than
                     without  compositing,  but with the composited mode behavior of the NVIDIA driver, there is
                     no hard playback speed limit even without the  disabled  logic.  Enabled  by  default,  use
                     <b>--vo-vdpau-composite-detect=no</b> to disable.

              <b>--vo-vdpau-queuetime-windowed=&lt;number&gt;</b> <b>and</b> <b>queuetime-fs=&lt;number&gt;</b>
                     Use  VDPAU's  presentation  queue functionality to queue future video frame changes at most
                     this many milliseconds in advance (default: 50).  See below for additional information.

              <b>--vo-vdpau-output-surfaces=&lt;2-15&gt;</b>
                     Allocate this many output surfaces to display video frames  (default:  3).  See  below  for
                     additional information.

              <b>--vo-vdpau-colorkey=&lt;#RRGGBB|#AARRGGBB&gt;</b>
                     Set  the  VDPAU presentation queue background color, which in practice is the colorkey used
                     if VDPAU operates in overlay mode (default: <b>#020507</b>, some shade of  black).  If  the  alpha
                     component  of  this  value  is 0, the default VDPAU colorkey will be used instead (which is
                     usually green).

              <b>--vo-vdpau-force-yuv</b>
                     Never accept RGBA input. This means mpv will insert a filter to convert  to  a  YUV  format
                     before  the  VO.  Sometimes useful to force availability of certain YUV-only features, like
                     video equalizer or deinterlacing.

              Using the VDPAU frame queuing functionality controlled by the queuetime options makes mpv's  frame
              flip  timing  less sensitive to system CPU load and allows mpv to start decoding the next frame(s)
              slightly earlier, which can reduce jitter caused by individual slow-to-decode frames. However, the
              NVIDIA graphics drivers can make other window behavior such as window moves  choppy  if  VDPAU  is
              using the blit queue (mainly happens if you have the composite extension enabled) and this feature
              is  active. If this happens on your system and it bothers you then you can set the queuetime value
              to 0 to disable this feature. The settings to use in windowed and  fullscreen  mode  are  separate
              because  there should be no reason to disable this for fullscreen mode (as the driver issue should
              not affect the video itself).

              You can queue more frames ahead by increasing the queuetime values and the  <b>output_surfaces</b>  count
              (to  ensure  enough  surfaces  to  buffer video for a certain time ahead you need at least as many
              surfaces as the video has frames during that time, plus two). This could help make video  smoother
              in  some  cases.  The  main  downsides  are  increased video RAM requirements for the surfaces and
              laggier display response to user commands (display changes only become  visible  some  time  after
              they're  queued). The graphics driver implementation may also have limits on the length of maximum
              queuing time or number of queued surfaces that work well or at all.

       <b>direct3d</b> <b>(Windows</b> <b>only)</b>
              Video output driver that uses the Direct3D interface.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This driver is for compatibility with systems that don't provide  proper  OpenGL  drivers,  and
                 where ANGLE does not perform well.

              The following global options are supported by this video output:

              <b>--vo-direct3d-disable-texture-align</b>
                     Normally  texture  sizes  are  always  aligned  to  16. With this option enabled, the video
                     texture will always have exactly the same size as the video itself.

              Debug options. These might be incorrect, might be removed in the future, might crash, might  cause
              slow  downs,  etc.  Contact  the  developers  if you actually need any of these for performance or
              proper operation.

              <b>--vo-direct3d-force-power-of-2</b>
                     Always force textures to power of 2, even if  the  device  reports  non-power-of-2  texture
                     sizes as supported.

              <b>--vo-direct3d-texture-memory=&lt;mode&gt;</b>
                     Only affects operation with shaders/texturing enabled, and (E)OSD.  Possible values:

                     <b>default</b> <b>(default)</b>
                            Use  <b>D3DPOOL_DEFAULT</b>,  with  a  <b>D3DPOOL_SYSTEMMEM</b> texture for locking. If the driver
                            supports <b>D3DDEVCAPS_TEXTURESYSTEMMEMORY</b>, <b>D3DPOOL_SYSTEMMEM</b> is used directly.

                     <b>default-pool</b>
                            Use <b>D3DPOOL_DEFAULT</b>. (Like <b>default</b>, but never use a shadow-texture.)

                     <b>default-pool-shadow</b>
                            Use <b>D3DPOOL_DEFAULT</b>, with a <b>D3DPOOL_SYSTEMMEM</b> texture for  locking.  (Like  <b>default</b>,
                            but always force the shadow-texture.)

                     <b>managed</b>
                            Use <b>D3DPOOL_MANAGED</b>.

                     <b>scratch</b>
                            Use <b>D3DPOOL_SCRATCH</b>, with a <b>D3DPOOL_SYSTEMMEM</b> texture for locking.

              <b>--vo-direct3d-swap-discard</b>
                     Use <b>D3DSWAPEFFECT_DISCARD</b>, which might be faster.  Might be slower too, as it must(?) clear
                     every frame.

              <b>--vo-direct3d-exact-backbuffer</b>
                     Always resize the backbuffer to window size.

       <b>sdl</b>    SDL  2.0+  Render  video output driver, depending on system with or without hardware acceleration.
              Should work on all platforms supported by SDL 2.0.  For tuning, refer to your  copy  of  the  file
              <b>SDL_hints.h</b>.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This driver is for compatibility with systems that don't provide proper graphics drivers.

              The following global options are supported by this video output:

              <b>--sdl-sw</b>
                     Continue even if a software renderer is detected.

              <b>--sdl-switch-mode</b>
                     Instruct SDL to switch the monitor video mode when going fullscreen.

       <b>dmabuf-wayland</b>
              Experimental  Wayland  output driver designed for use with either drm stateless or VA API hardware
              decoding. The driver is designed to avoid any GPU to CPU copies, and to perform scaling and  color
              space  conversion using fixed-function hardware, if available, rather than GPU shaders. This frees
              up GPU resources for other tasks.  It is highly recommended to use this VO  with  the  appropriate
              <b>--hwdec</b>  option  such as <b>auto-safe</b>. It can still work in some circumstances without <b>--hwdec</b> due to
              mpv's internal conversion filters, but this is not recommended as  it's  a  needless  extra  step.
              Correct  output  depends  on  support  from  your GPU, drivers, and compositor.  This requires the
              compositor and mpv to support <b>color-management-v1</b>  to  accurately  display  colorspaces  that  are
              different from the compositor default (bt.601 in most cases).

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 This  driver  is not required for mpv to work on Wayland. <b>vo=gpu</b> and <b>vo=gpu-next</b> will switch to
                 the appropriate Wayland context automatically. This driver is experimental and generally  lower
                 quality than <b>gpu</b>/<b>gpu-next</b>.

       <b>vaapi</b>  Intel VA API video output driver with support for hardware decoding. Note that there is absolutely
              no reason to use this, other than compatibility.  This is low quality, and has issues with OSD. We
              strongly recommend that you use <b>--vo=gpu</b> with <b>--hwdec=vaapi</b> instead.

              The following global options are supported by this video output:

              <b>--vo-vaapi-scaling=&lt;algorithm&gt;</b>

                     <b>default</b>
                            Driver default (mpv default as well).

                     <b>fast</b>   Fast, but low quality.

                     <b>hq</b>     Unspecified driver dependent high-quality scaling, slow.

                     <b>nla</b>    <b>non-linear</b> <b>anamorphic</b> <b>scaling</b>

              <b>--vo-vaapi-scaled-osd=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
                     If  enabled, then the OSD is rendered at video resolution and scaled to display resolution.
                     By default, this is disabled, and the OSD is rendered at display resolution if  the  driver
                     supports it.

       <b>null</b>   Produces no video output. Useful for benchmarking.

              Usually, it's better to disable video with <b>--video=no</b> instead.

              The following global options are supported by this video output:

              <b>--vo-null-fps=&lt;value&gt;</b>
                     Simulate display FPS. This artificially limits how many frames the VO accepts per second.

       <b>caca</b>   Color ASCII art video output driver that works on a text console.

              This  driver  reserves some keys for runtime configuration. These keys are hardcoded and cannot be
              bound:

              <b>d</b> <b>and</b> <b>D</b>
                     Toggle dithering algorithm.

              <b>a</b> <b>and</b> <b>A</b>
                     Toggle antialiasing method.

              <b>h</b> <b>and</b> <b>H</b>
                     Toggle charset method.

              <b>c</b> <b>and</b> <b>C</b>
                     Toggle color method.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This driver is a joke.

       <b>tct</b>    Color Unicode art video output driver that works on a text console.  By default depends on support
              of true color by modern terminals to display the images at full color range, but 256-colors output
              is also supported (see below). On Windows it requires an ansi terminal such as mintty.

              Since mpv 0.30.0, you may need to use <b>--profile=sw-fast</b> to get decent performance.

              Note: the TCT image output is not synchronized with other terminal output from mpv, which can lead
              to broken images. The options <b>--terminal=no</b> or <b>--really-quiet</b> can help with that.

              <b>--vo-tct-algo=&lt;algo&gt;</b>
                     Select how to write the pixels to the terminal.

                     <b>half-blocks</b>
                            Uses Unicode LOWER HALF BLOCK  character  to  achieve  higher  vertical  resolution.
                            (Default.)

                     <b>plain</b>  Uses  spaces.  Causes  vertical  resolution to drop twofolds, but in theory works in
                            more places.

              <b>--vo-tct-buffering=&lt;pixel|line|frame&gt;</b>
                     Specifies the size of data batches buffered before being sent to the terminal.

                     TCT image output is not synchronized with other terminal output from mpv, which can lead to
                     broken images. Sending data to the  terminal  in  small  batches  may  improve  parallelism
                     between  terminal  processing and mpv processing but incurs a static overhead of generating
                     tens of thousands of small writes. Also, depending on the terminal used, sending frames  in
                     one chunk might help with tearing of the output, especially if not used with <b>--really-quiet</b>
                     and other logs interrupt the data stream.

                     <b>pixel</b>  Send data to terminal for each pixel.

                     <b>line</b>   Send data to terminal for each line. (Default)

                     <b>frame</b>  Send data to terminal for each frame.

              <b>--vo-tct-width=&lt;width&gt;</b> <b>--vo-tct-height=&lt;height&gt;</b>
                     Assume  the  terminal  has  the  specified character width and/or height.  These default to
                     80x25 if the terminal size cannot be determined.

              <b>--vo-tct-256=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
                     Use 256 colors - for terminals which don't support true color.

       <b>kitty</b>  Graphical output for the terminal, using the kitty  graphics  protocol.   Tested  with  kitty  and
              Konsole.

              You may need to use <b>--profile=sw-fast</b> to get decent performance.

              Kitty size and alignment options:

              <b>--vo-kitty-cols=&lt;columns&gt;,</b> <b>--vo-kitty-rows=&lt;rows&gt;</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0)</b>
                     Specify  the  terminal size in character cells, otherwise (0) read it from the terminal, or
                     fall back to 80x25.

              <b>--vo-kitty-width=&lt;width&gt;,</b> <b>--vo-kitty-height=&lt;height&gt;</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0)</b>
                     Specify the available size in pixels, otherwise (0) read it from the terminal, or fall back
                     to 320x240.

              <b>--vo-kitty-left=&lt;col&gt;,</b> <b>--vo-kitty-top=&lt;row&gt;</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0)</b>
                     Specify the position in character cells where the image starts (1 is the  first  column  or
                     row).  If  0 (default) then try to automatically determine it according to the other values
                     and the image aspect ratio and zoom.

              <b>--vo-kitty-config-clear=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
                     Whether or not to clear the terminal whenever the output is reconfigured (e.g.  when  video
                     size changes).

              <b>--vo-kitty-alt-screen=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
                     Whether  or  not to use the alternate screen buffer and return the terminal to its previous
                     state on exit. When set to no, the last kitty image stays on screen after  quit,  with  the
                     cursor following it.

              <b>--vo-kitty-use-shm=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
                     Use shared memory objects to transfer image data to the terminal.  This is much faster than
                     sending  the  data as escape codes, but is not supported by as many terminals. It also only
                     works on the local machine and not via e.g. SSH connections.

                     This option is not implemented on Windows.

       <b>sixel</b>  Graphical output for the terminal, using sixels. Tested with <b>mlterm</b> and <b>xterm</b>.

              Note: the Sixel image output is not synchronized with other terminal output from  mpv,  which  can
              lead to broken images.  The option <b>--really-quiet</b> can help with that, and is recommended.  On some
              platforms, using the <b>--vo-sixel-buffered</b> option may work as well.

              You may need to use <b>--profile=sw-fast</b> to get decent performance.

              Note:  at  the time of writing, <b>xterm</b> does not enable sixel by default - launching it as <b>xterm</b> <b>-ti</b>
              <b>340</b> is one way to enable it. Also, <b>xterm</b> does not display images bigger than 1000x1000  pixels  by
              default.

              To  render and align sixel images correctly, mpv needs to know the terminal size both in cells and
              in pixels. By default it tries  to  use  values  which  the  terminal  reports,  however,  due  to
              differences  between  terminals  this  is  an  error-prone  process which cannot be automated with
              certainty - some terminals report the size in pixels including the padding  -  e.g.  <b>xterm</b>,  while
              others  report  the  actual  usable number of pixels - like <b>mlterm</b>.  Additionally, they may behave
              differently when maximized or in fullscreen, and mpv  cannot  detect  this  state  using  standard
              methods.

              Sixel size and alignment options:

              <b>--vo-sixel-cols=&lt;columns&gt;,</b> <b>--vo-sixel-rows=&lt;rows&gt;</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0)</b>
                     Specify  the  terminal size in character cells, otherwise (0) read it from the terminal, or
                     fall back to 80x25. Note that mpv doesn't use the the last  row  with  sixel  because  this
                     seems to result in scrolling.

              <b>--vo-sixel-width=&lt;width&gt;,</b> <b>--vo-sixel-height=&lt;height&gt;</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0)</b>
                     Specify the available size in pixels, otherwise (0) read it from the terminal, or fall back
                     to  320x240. Other than excluding the last line, the height is also further rounded down to
                     a multiple of 6 (sixel unit height) to avoid overflowing below the designated size.

              <b>--vo-sixel-left=&lt;col&gt;,</b> <b>--vo-sixel-top=&lt;row&gt;</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0)</b>
                     Specify the position in character cells where the image starts (1 is the  first  column  or
                     row).  If  0 (default) then try to automatically determine it according to the other values
                     and the image aspect ratio and zoom.

              <b>--vo-sixel-pad-x=&lt;pad_x&gt;,</b> <b>--vo-sixel-pad-y=&lt;pad_y&gt;</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>-1)</b>
                     Used only when mpv reads the size in pixels from  the  terminal.   Specify  the  number  of
                     padding  pixels (on one side) which are included at the size which the terminal reports. If
                     -1 (default) then the number of pixels is rounded down to a multiple  of  number  of  cells
                     (per axis), to take into account padding at the report - this only works correctly when the
                     overall padding per axis is smaller than the number of cells.

              <b>--vo-sixel-config-clear=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
                     Whether  or  not to clear the terminal whenever the output is reconfigured (e.g. when video
                     size changes).

              <b>--vo-sixel-alt-screen=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
                     Whether or not to use the alternate screen buffer and return the terminal to  its  previous
                     state  on  exit.  When set to no, the last sixel image stays on screen after quit, with the
                     cursor following it.

                     <b>--vo-sixel-exit-clear</b> is a deprecated alias for this option  and  may  be  removed  in  the
                     future.

              <b>--vo-sixel-buffered=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b>
                     Buffers  the  full  output sequence before writing it to the terminal.  On POSIX platforms,
                     this can help prevent interruption (including from  other  applications)  and  thus  broken
                     images,  but  may  come  at  a  performance  cost  with  some  terminals  and is subject to
                     implementation details.

              Sixel image quality options:

              <b>--vo-sixel-dither=&lt;algo&gt;</b>
                     Selects the dither algorithm which libsixel should apply.  Can be one of the below list  as
                     per libsixel's documentation.

                     <b>auto</b> <b>(Default)</b>
                            Let libsixel choose the dithering method.

                     <b>none</b>   Don't diffuse

                     <b>atkinson</b>
                            Diffuse with Bill Atkinson's method.

                     <b>fs</b>     Diffuse with Floyd-Steinberg method

                     <b>jajuni</b> Diffuse with Jarvis, Judice &amp; Ninke method

                     <b>stucki</b> Diffuse with Stucki's method

                     <b>burkes</b> Diffuse with Burkes' method

                     <b>arithmetic</b>
                            Positionally stable arithmetic dither

                     <b>xor</b>    Positionally stable arithmetic xor based dither

              <b>--vo-sixel-fixedpalette=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b>
                     Use libsixel's built-in static palette using the XTERM256 profile for dither. Fixed palette
                     uses  256  colors for dithering. Note that using <b>no</b> (at the time of writing) will slow down
                     <b>xterm</b>.

              <b>--vo-sixel-reqcolors=&lt;colors&gt;</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>256)</b>
                     Has no effect with fixed palette. Set up libsixel to use  required  number  of  colors  for
                     dynamic  palette.  This  value depends on the terminal emulator as well. Xterm supports 256
                     colors. Can set this to a lower value for faster performance.

              <b>--vo-sixel-threshold=&lt;threshold&gt;</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>-1)</b>
                     Has no effect with fixed palette.  Defines  the  threshold  to  change  the  palette  -  as
                     percentage  of  the  number  of  colors, e.g. 20 will change the palette when the number of
                     colors changed by 20%. It's a simple measure to  reduce  the  number  of  palette  changes,
                     because it can be slow in some terminals (<b>xterm</b>). The default (-1) will choose a palette on
                     every frame and will have better quality.

       <b>image</b>  Output  each  frame  into an image file in the current directory. Each file takes the frame number
              padded with leading zeros as name.

              The following global options are supported by this video output:

              <b>--vo-image-format=&lt;format&gt;</b>
                     Select the image file format.

                     <b>jpg</b>    JPEG files, extension .jpg. (Default.)

                     <b>jpeg</b>   JPEG files, extension .jpeg.

                     <b>png</b>    PNG files.

                     <b>webp</b>   WebP files.

              <b>--vo-image-png-compression=&lt;0-9&gt;</b>
                     PNG compression factor (speed vs. file size tradeoff) (default: 7)

              <b>--vo-image-png-filter=&lt;0-5&gt;</b>
                     Filter applied prior to PNG compression (0 = none; 1 = sub; 2 = up; 3 = average; 4 = Paeth;
                     5 = mixed) (default: 5)

              <b>--vo-image-jpeg-quality=&lt;0-100&gt;</b>
                     JPEG quality factor (default: 90)

              <b>--vo-image-jpeg-optimize=&lt;0-100&gt;</b>
                     JPEG optimization factor (default: 100)

              <b>--vo-image-webp-lossless=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
                     Enable writing lossless WebP files (default: no)

              <b>--vo-image-webp-quality=&lt;0-100&gt;</b>
                     WebP quality (default: 75)

              <b>--vo-image-webp-compression=&lt;0-6&gt;</b>
                     WebP compression factor (default: 4)

              <b>--vo-image-outdir=&lt;dirname&gt;</b>
                     Specify the directory to save the image files to (default: <b>./</b>).

       <b>libmpv</b> For use with libmpv direct embedding. As a special case, on macOS it is  used  like  a  normal  VO
              within mpv (cocoa-cb). Otherwise useless in any other contexts.  (See <b>&lt;mpv/render.h&gt;</b>.)

              This also supports many of the options the <b>gpu</b> VO has, depending on the backend.

       <b>drm</b> <b>(Direct</b> <b>Rendering</b> <b>Manager)</b>
              Video output driver using Kernel Mode Setting / Direct Rendering Manager.  Should be used when one
              doesn't  want  to  install full-blown graphical environment (e.g. no X). Does not support hardware
              acceleration (if you need this, check the <b>drm</b> backend for <b>gpu</b> VO).

              Since mpv 0.30.0, you may need to use <b>--profile=sw-fast</b> to get decent performance.

              The following global options are supported by this video output:

              <b>--drm-connector=&lt;name&gt;</b>
                     Select the connector to use (usually this is a monitor.) If <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> is empty  or  <b>auto</b>,  mpv
                     renders the output on the first available connector. Use <b>--drm-connector=help</b> to get a list
                     of available connectors. (default: empty)

              <b>--drm-device=&lt;path&gt;</b>
                     Select  the  DRM  device file to use. If specified this overrides automatic card selection.
                     (default: empty)

              <b>--drm-mode=&lt;preferred|highest|N|WxH[@R]&gt;</b>
                     Mode to use (resolution and frame rate).  Possible values:

                     <b>preferred</b>
                            Use the preferred mode for the screen on the selected connector. (default)

                     <b>highest</b>
                            Use the mode with the highest resolution available on the selected connector.

                     <b>N</b>      Select mode by index.

                     <b>WxH[@R]</b>
                            Specify mode by width, height, and optionally refresh rate.  In case  several  modes
                            match, selects the mode that comes first in the EDID list of modes.

                     Use <b>--drm-mode=help</b> to get a list of available modes for all active connectors.

              <b>--drm-draw-plane=&lt;primary|overlay|N&gt;</b>
                     Select  the  DRM  plane to which video and OSD is drawn to, under normal circumstances. The
                     plane can be specified as <b>primary</b>, which will pick  the  first  applicable  primary  plane;
                     <b>overlay</b>, which will pick the first applicable overlay plane; or by index. The index is zero
                     based, and related to the CRTC.  (default: primary)

                     When using this option with the drmprime-overlay hwdec interop, only the OSD is rendered to
                     this plane.

              <b>--drm-drmprime-video-plane=&lt;primary|overlay|N&gt;</b>
                     Select the DRM plane to use for video with the drmprime-overlay hwdec interop (used by e.g.
                     the  rkmpp  hwdec  on RockChip SoCs, and v4l2 hwdec:s on various other SoC:s). The plane is
                     unused otherwise. This option  accepts  the  same  values  as  <b>--drm-draw-plane</b>.  (default:
                     overlay)

                     To  be  able  to  successfully  play  4K  video  on  various  SoCs  you  might  need to set
                     <b>--drm-draw-plane=overlay</b>       <b>--drm-drmprime-video-plane=primary</b>        and        setting
                     <b>--drm-draw-surface-size=1920x1080</b>,  to render the OSD at a lower resolution (the video when
                     handled by the hwdec will be on the drmprime-video plane and at full 4K resolution)

              <b>--drm-format=&lt;xrgb8888|xbgr8888|xrgb2101010|xbgr2101010|yuyv&gt;</b>
                     Select the DRM format to use (default: xrgb8888). This allows you to choose the  bit  depth
                     and color type of the DRM mode.

                     xrgb8888  is  your  usual 24bpp packed RGB format with 8 bits of padding.  xrgb2101010 is a
                     30bpp packed RGB format with 2 bits of padding.  yuyv is a 32bpp packed YUV  4:2:2  format.
                     No planar formats are currently supported.

                     There  are  cases  when xrgb2101010 will work with the <b>drm</b> VO, but not with the <b>drm</b> backend
                     for the <b>gpu</b> VO. This is because with the <b>gpu</b> VO, in addition to requiring support  in  your
                     DRM driver, requires support for xrgb2101010 in your EGL driver.  yuyv only ever works with
                     the <b>drm</b> VO.

              <b>--drm-draw-surface-size=&lt;[WxH]&gt;</b>
                     Sets  the  size of the surface used on the draw plane. The surface will then be upscaled to
                     the current screen resolution. This option can  be  useful  when  used  together  with  the
                     drmprime-overlay  hwdec  interop  at  high resolutions, as it allows scaling the draw plane
                     (which in this case only handles the OSD) down to a size the GPU can handle.

                     When used without the drmprime-overlay hwdec interop this option will just cause the  video
                     to get rendered at a different resolution and then scaled to screen size.

                     (default: display resolution)

              <b>--drm-vrr-enabled=&lt;no|yes|auto&gt;</b>
                     Toggle  use  of  Variable  Refresh  Rate (VRR), aka Freesync or Adaptive Sync on compatible
                     systems. VRR allows for the display to be refreshed at any rate  within  a  range  (usually
                     ~40Hz-60Hz  for 60Hz displays). This can help with playback of 24/25/50fps content. Support
                     depends on the use of a compatible monitor, GPU, and a sufficiently new kernel with drivers
                     that support the feature.

                     <b>no</b>     Do not attempt to enable VRR. (default)

                     <b>yes</b>    Attempt to enable VRR, whether the capability is reported or not.

                     <b>auto</b>   Attempt to enable VRR if support is reported.

       <b>mediacodec_embed</b> <b>(Android)</b>
              Renders <b>IMGFMT_MEDIACODEC</b> frames directly to an <b>android.view.Surface</b>.  Requires <b>--hwdec=mediacodec</b>
              for       hardware       decoding,       along        with        <b>--vo=mediacodec_embed</b>        and
              <b>--wid=(intptr_t)(*android.view.Surface)</b>.

              Since this video output driver uses native decoding and rendering routines, many of mpv's features
              (subtitle rendering, OSD/OSC, video filters, etc) are not available with this driver.

              To  use  hardware  decoding with <b>--vo=gpu</b> instead, use <b>--hwdec=mediacodec</b> or <b>mediacodec-copy</b> along
              with <b>--gpu-context=android</b>.

       <b>wlshm</b> <b>(Wayland</b> <b>only)</b>
              Shared memory video output driver without hardware acceleration that  works  whenever  Wayland  is
              present.

              Since mpv 0.30.0, you may need to use <b>--profile=sw-fast</b> to get decent performance.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This is a fallback only, and should not be normally used.

</pre><h4><b>AUDIO</b> <b>FILTERS</b></h4><pre>
       Audio filters allow you to modify the audio stream and its properties. The syntax is:

       <b>--af=...</b>
              Setup a chain of audio filters. See <b>--vf</b> (VIDEO FILTERS) for the full syntax.

              This is an object settings list option. See List Options for details.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          To get a full list of available audio filters, see <b>--af=help</b>.

          Also,  keep  in  mind  that  most  actual filters are available via the <b>lavfi</b> wrapper, which gives you
          access to most of libavfilter's filters. This includes all filters that have been ported from  MPlayer
          to libavfilter.

          The  <b>--vf</b>  description  describes  how  libavfilter  can  be used and how to workaround deprecated mpv
          filters.

       See <b>--vf</b> group of options for info on how <b>--af-add</b>, <b>--af-pre</b>, <b>--af-clr</b>, and possibly others work.

       Available filters are:

       <b>lavcac3enc[=options]</b>
              Encode multi-channel audio to AC-3 at runtime  using  libavcodec.  Supports  16-bit  native-endian
              input  format,  maximum  6  channels.  The output is big-endian when outputting a raw AC-3 stream,
              native-endian when outputting to S/PDIF. If the input sample rate is not 48 kHz, 44.1  kHz  or  32
              kHz, it will be resampled to 48 kHz.

              <b>tospdif=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
                     Output raw AC-3 stream if <b>no</b>, output to S/PDIF for pass-through if <b>yes</b> (default).

              <b>bitrate=&lt;rate&gt;</b>
                     The bitrate use for the AC-3 stream. Set it to 384 to get 384 kbps.

                     The default is 640. Some receivers might not be able to handle this.

                     Valid values: 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 160, 192, 224, 256, 320, 384, 448, 512,
                     576, 640.

                     The special value <b>auto</b> selects a default bitrate based on the input channel number:

                     <b>1ch</b>    96

                     <b>2ch</b>    192

                     <b>3ch</b>    224

                     <b>4ch</b>    384

                     <b>5ch</b>    448

                     <b>6ch</b>    448

              <b>minch=&lt;n&gt;</b>
                     If  the  input channel number is less than <b>&lt;minch&gt;</b>, the filter will detach itself (default:
                     3).

              <b>encoder=&lt;name&gt;</b>
                     Select the libavcodec encoder used. Currently, this should be an AC-3  encoder,  and  using
                     another codec will fail horribly.

       <b>format=format:srate:channels:out-srate:out-channels</b>
              Does  not  do  any  format  conversion  itself.  Rather,  it may cause the filter system to insert
              necessary conversion filters before or after this filter if needed. It  is  primarily  useful  for
              controlling the audio format going into other filters. To specify the format for audio output, see
              <b>--audio-format</b>,  <b>--audio-samplerate</b>,  and  <b>--audio-channels</b>.  This  filter  is  able  to  force  a
              particular format, whereas <b>--audio-*</b> may be overridden by the ao based on output compatibility.

              All parameters are optional. The first 3 parameters restrict what the  filter  accepts  as  input.
              They  will therefore cause conversion filters to be inserted before this one.  The <b>out-</b> parameters
              tell the filters or audio outputs following this filter how to interpret the data without actually
              doing a conversion. Setting these will probably just break things unless you really know you  want
              this for some reason, such as testing or dealing with broken media.

              <b>&lt;format&gt;</b>
                     Force  conversion  to  this  format.  Use  <b>--af=format=format=help</b>  to  get a list of valid
                     formats.

              <b>&lt;srate&gt;</b>
                     Force conversion to a specific sample rate. The rate is an integer, 48000 for example.

              <b>&lt;channels&gt;</b>
                     Force mixing to a specific channel layout. See <b>--audio-channels</b> option for possible values.

              <b>&lt;out-srate&gt;</b>

              <b>&lt;out-channels&gt;</b>

              <u>NOTE</u>: this filter used to be named <b>force</b>. The old <b>format</b> filter  used  to  do  conversion  itself,
              unlike this one which lets the filter system handle the conversion.

       <b>scaletempo[=option1:option2:...]</b>
              Scales audio tempo without altering pitch, optionally synced to playback speed.

              This  works  by  playing  'stride' ms of audio at normal speed then consuming 'stride*scale' ms of
              input audio. It pieces the strides together by blending 'overlap'% of stride with audio  following
              the  previous  stride. It optionally performs a short statistical analysis on the next 'search' ms
              of audio to determine the best overlap position.

              <b>scale=&lt;amount&gt;</b>
                     Nominal amount to scale tempo. Scales this amount in addition to speed. (default: 1.0)

              <b>stride=&lt;amount&gt;</b>
                     Length in milliseconds to output each stride. Too high of a  value  will  cause  noticeable
                     skips  at  high  scale amounts and an echo at low scale amounts. Very low values will alter
                     pitch. Increasing improves performance. (default: 60)

              <b>overlap=&lt;factor&gt;</b>
                     Factor of stride to overlap. Decreasing improves performance.  (default: .20)

              <b>search=&lt;amount&gt;</b>
                     Length in milliseconds to search for best overlap position. Decreasing improves performance
                     greatly. On slow systems, you will probably want to set this very low. (default: 14)

              <b>speed=&lt;tempo|pitch|both|none&gt;</b>
                     Set response to speed change.

                     <b>tempo</b>  Scale tempo in sync with speed (default).

                     <b>pitch</b>  Reverses effect of filter. Scales pitch without altering tempo.  Add  this  to  your
                            <b>input.conf</b> to step by musical semi-tones:

                               [ multiply speed 0.9438743126816935
                               ] multiply speed 1.059463094352953

                            <b>WARNING:</b>
                               Loses sync with video.

                     <b>both</b>   Scale both tempo and pitch.

                     <b>none</b>   Ignore speed changes.

                 Examples

                 <b>mpv</b> <b>--af=scaletempo</b> <b>--speed=1.2</b> <b>media.ogg</b>
                        Would  play  media  at  1.2x normal speed, with audio at normal pitch. Changing playback
                        speed would change audio tempo to match.

                 <b>mpv</b> <b>--af=scaletempo=scale=1.2:speed=none</b> <b>--speed=1.2</b> <b>media.ogg</b>
                        Would play media at 1.2x normal speed, with audio at normal pitch, but changing playback
                        speed would have no effect on audio tempo.

                 <b>mpv</b> <b>--af=scaletempo=stride=30:overlap=.50:search=10</b> <b>media.ogg</b>
                        Would tweak the quality and performance parameters.

                 <b>mpv</b> <b>--af=scaletempo=scale=1.2:speed=pitch</b> <b>audio.ogg</b>
                        Would play media at 1.2x normal speed, with audio at normal  pitch.   Changing  playback
                        speed would change pitch, leaving audio tempo at 1.2x.

       <b>scaletempo2[=option1:option2:...]</b>
              Scales  audio  tempo  without  altering pitch.  The algorithm is ported from chromium and uses the
              Waveform Similarity Overlap-and-add (WSOLA) method.  It seems to  achieves  higher  audio  quality
              than scaletempo, and rubberband R2 engine, or <b>engine=faster</b>. This filter is inserted automatically
              if <b>audio-pitch-correction</b> option is used (on by default) when the playback speed is changed.

              By default, the <b>search-interval</b> and <b>window-size</b> parameters have the same values as in chromium.

              <b>min-speed=&lt;speed&gt;</b>
                     Mute audio if the playback speed is below <b>&lt;speed&gt;</b>. (default: 0.25)

              <b>max-speed=&lt;speed&gt;</b>
                     Mute audio if the playback speed is above <b>&lt;speed&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;speed&gt;</b> <b>!=</b> <b>0</b>. (default: 8.0)

              <b>search-interval=&lt;amount&gt;</b>
                     Length in milliseconds to search for best overlap position. (default: 40)

              <b>window-size=&lt;amount&gt;</b>
                     Length in milliseconds of the overlap-and-add window. (default: 12)

       <b>rubberband</b>
              High  quality  pitch  correction  with  librubberband. This can be used in place of <b>scaletempo</b> and
              <b>scaletempo2</b>, and will be used to adjust audio pitch when playing at speed different  from  normal.
              It can also be used to adjust audio pitch without changing playback speed.

              <b>pitch-scale=&lt;amount&gt;</b>
                     Sets the pitch scaling factor. Frequencies are multiplied by this value.  (default: 1.0)

              <b>engine=&lt;faster|finer&gt;</b>
                     Select the core Rubberband engine to be used. There are two available:

                     <b>Faster</b> This is the Rubberband R2 engine. It uses significantly less CPU than the Finer (R3)
                            engine.

                     <b>Finer</b>  This  is  the Rubberband R3 engine. This engine is only available with librubberband
                            version 3 or newer. This produces significantly higher quality output, at  the  cost
                            of higher CPU usage. (Default if available)

              This   filter   has   a   number   of   additional   sub-options.  You  can  list  them  with  <b>mpv</b>
              <b>--af=rubberband=help</b>. This will also show the default values for each option. The options are  not
              documented  here,  because  they  are  merely  passed  to librubberband. Look at the librubberband
              documentation to learn what each option does:
               &lt;https://breakfastquay.com/rubberband/code-doc/classRubberBand_1_1RubberBandStretcher.html&gt;    Do
              note  that certain options are only applicable to one of R2 (faster) and R3 (finer) engines.  (The
              mapping of the mpv rubberband filter sub-option names and values to those of librubberband follows
              a simple pattern: <b>"Option"</b> <b>+</b> <b>Name</b> <b>+</b> <b>Value</b>.)

              This filter supports the following <b>af-command</b> commands:

              <b>set-pitch</b>
                     Set the <b>&lt;pitch-scale&gt;</b> argument dynamically. This can be used to change the  playback  pitch
                     at  runtime.  Note  that  speed  is  controlled  using  the  standard  <b>speed</b>  property, not
                     <b>af-command</b>.

              <b>multiply-pitch</b> <b>&lt;factor&gt;</b>
                     Multiply the current value of <b>&lt;pitch-scale&gt;</b> dynamically.

       <b>lavfi=graph</b>
              Filter audio using FFmpeg's libavfilter.

              <b>&lt;graph&gt;</b>
                     Libavfilter graph. See <b>lavfi</b> video filter for details - the graph syntax is the same.

                     <b>WARNING:</b>
                        Don't forget to quote libavfilter graphs as described in the lavfi video filter section.

              <b>o=&lt;string&gt;</b>
                     AVOptions.

              <b>fix-pts=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
                     Determine PTS based on sample count (default: no). If this is  enabled,  the  player  won't
                     rely on libavfilter passing through PTS accurately.  Instead, it pass a sample count as PTS
                     to libavfilter, and compute the PTS used by mpv based on that and the input PTS. This helps
                     with  filters  which output a recomputed PTS instead of the original PTS (including filters
                     which require the PTS to start at 0). mpv normally expects filters to not touch the PTS (or
                     only to the extent of changing frame boundaries), so this is not the default, but  it  will
                     be  needed  to use broken filters. In practice, these broken filters will either cause slow
                     A/V desync over time (with some files), or break playback completely if you seek  or  start
                     playback from the middle of a file.

       <b>drop</b>   This  filter  drops or repeats audio frames to adapt to playback speed. It always operates on full
              audio frames, because it was made to handle SPDIF (compressed audio  passthrough).  This  is  used
              automatically  if  the  <b>--video-sync=display-adrop</b>  option is used. Do not use this filter (or the
              given option); they are extremely low quality.

</pre><h4><b>VIDEO</b> <b>FILTERS</b></h4><pre>
       Video filters allow you to modify the video stream and its properties. All of the  information  described
       in this section applies to audio filters as well (generally using the prefix <b>--af</b> instead of <b>--vf</b>).

       The exact syntax is:

       <b>--vf=&lt;filter1[=parameter1:parameter2:...],filter2,...&gt;</b>
              Setup a chain of video filters. This consists on the filter name, and an option list of parameters
              after <b>=</b>. The parameters are separated by <b>:</b> (not <b>,</b>, as that starts a new filter entry).

              Before  the  filter  name,  a  label  can  be  specified  with  <b>@name:</b>, where name is an arbitrary
              user-given name, which identifies the filter. This is only needed if you want to toggle the filter
              at runtime.

              A <b>!</b> before the filter name means the filter is disabled by default. It will be skipped  on  filter
              creation. This is also useful for runtime filter toggling.

              See the <b>vf</b> command (and <b>toggle</b> sub-command) for further explanations and examples.

              This is an object settings list option. See List Options for details.

              The general filter entry syntax is:
                 <b>["@"&lt;label-name&gt;":"]</b> <b>["!"]</b> <b>&lt;filter-name&gt;</b> <b>[</b> <b>"="</b> <b>&lt;filter-parameter-list&gt;</b> <b>]</b>

              or for the special "toggle" syntax (see <b>vf</b> command):
                 <b>"@"&lt;label-name&gt;</b>

              and the <b>filter-parameter-list</b>:
                 <b>&lt;filter-parameter&gt;</b> <b>|</b> <b>&lt;filter-parameter&gt;</b> <b>","</b> <b>&lt;filter-parameter-list&gt;</b>

              and <b>filter-parameter</b>:
                 <b>(</b> <b>&lt;param-name&gt;</b> <b>"="</b> <b>&lt;param-value&gt;</b> <b>)</b> <b>|</b> <b>&lt;param-value&gt;</b>

              <b>param-value</b> can further be quoted in <b>[</b> / <b>]</b> in case the value contains characters like <b>,</b> or <b>=</b>. This
              is  used  in  particular  with  the <b>lavfi</b> filter, which uses a very similar syntax as mpv (MPlayer
              historically) to specify filters and their parameters.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          <b>--vf</b> can only take a single track as input, even if the filter supports dynamic  input.  Filters  that
          require multiple inputs can't be used.  Use <b>--lavfi-complex</b> for such a use case. This also applies for
          <b>--af</b>.

       Filters  can  be manipulated at run time. You can use <b>@</b> labels as described above in combination with the
       <b>vf</b> command (see COMMAND INTERFACE) to get more control over this. Initially disabled filters with  <b>!</b>  are
       useful for this as well.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          To get a full list of available video filters, see <b>--vf=help</b> and
           &lt;https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html&gt;  .

          Also,  keep  in  mind  that  most  actual filters are available via the <b>lavfi</b> wrapper, which gives you
          access to most of libavfilter's filters. This includes all filters that have been ported from  MPlayer
          to libavfilter.

          Most  builtin  filters  are  deprecated  in  some  ways, unless they're only available in mpv (such as
          filters which deal with mpv specifics, or which are implemented in mpv only).

          If a filter is not builtin, the <b>lavfi-bridge</b> will be automatically tried. This bridge does not support
          help output, and does not verify parameters before the filter  is  actually  used.  Although  the  mpv
          syntax  is rather similar to libavfilter's, it's not the same. (Which means not everything accepted by
          vf_lavfi's <b>graph</b> option will be accepted by <b>--vf</b>.)

          You can also prefix the filter name with <b>lavfi-</b> to force the wrapper.  This is helpful if  the  filter
          name  collides  with  a  deprecated  mpv  builtin  filter. For example <b>--vf=lavfi-scale=args</b> would use
          libavfilter's <b>scale</b> filter over mpv's deprecated builtin one.

       Video filters are managed in lists. There are a few commands to manage the filter list.

       <b>--vf-append=filter</b>
              Appends the filter given as arguments to the filter list.

       <b>--vf-add=filter</b>
              Appends the filter given as arguments to the filter list. (Passing multiple filters  is  currently
              still possible, but deprecated.)

       <b>--vf-pre=filter</b>
              Prepends the filters given as arguments to the filter list. (Passing multiple filters is currently
              still possible, but deprecated.)

       <b>--vf-remove=filter</b>
              Deletes the filter from the list. The filter can be either given the way it was added (filter name
              and  its full argument list), or by label (prefixed with <b>@</b>). Matching of filters works as follows:
              if either of the compared filters has a label set, only the labels are compared. If  none  of  the
              filters  have  a  label,  the  filter  name,  arguments, and argument order are compared. (Passing
              multiple filters is currently still possible, but deprecated.)

       <b>--vf-toggle=filter</b>
              Add the given filter to the list if it was not present yet, or remove it from the list if  it  was
              present. Matching of filters works as described in <b>--vf-remove</b>.

       <b>--vf-clr</b>
              Completely empties the filter list.

       With filters that support it, you can access parameters by their name.

       <b>--vf=&lt;filter&gt;=help</b>
              Prints the parameter names and parameter value ranges for a particular filter.

       Available mpv-only filters are:

       <b>format=fmt=&lt;value&gt;:colormatrix=&lt;value&gt;:...</b>
              Applies  video  parameter  overrides,  with  optional  conversion.  By default, this overrides the
              video's parameters without conversion (except for the <b>fmt</b> parameter), but can be made  to  perform
              an appropriate conversion with <b>convert=yes</b> for parameters for which conversion is supported.

              <b>&lt;fmt&gt;</b>  Image format name, e.g. rgb15, bgr24, 420p, etc. (default: don't change).

                     This filter always performs conversion to the given format.

                     <b>NOTE:</b>
                        For a list of available formats, use <b>--vf=format=fmt=help</b>.

                     <b>NOTE:</b>
                        Conversion  between hardware formats is supported in some cases.  eg: <b>cuda</b> to <b>vulkan</b>, or
                        <b>vaapi</b> to <b>vulkan</b>.

              <b>&lt;convert=yes|no&gt;</b>
                     Force conversion of color parameters (default: no).

                     If this is disabled (the default), the only conversion that is possibly performed is format
                     conversion if <b>&lt;fmt&gt;</b> is set. All other parameters (like <b>&lt;colormatrix&gt;</b>)  are  forced  without
                     conversion. This mode is typically useful when files have been incorrectly tagged.

                     If  this  is enabled, libswscale or zimg is used if any of the parameters mismatch. zimg is
                     used of the input/output image  formats  are  supported  by  mpv's  zimg  wrapper,  and  if
                     <b>--sws-allow-zimg=yes</b> is used. Both libraries may not support all kinds of conversions. This
                     typically results in silent incorrect conversion. zimg has in many cases a better chance of
                     performing the conversion correctly.

                     In  both  cases,  the  color  parameters  are  set  on the output stage of the image format
                     conversion (if <b>fmt</b> was set). The difference is that with <b>convert=no</b>, the  color  parameters
                     are not passed on to the converter.

                     If input and output video parameters are the same, conversion is always skipped.

                     When  converting  between  hardware  formats,  this  parameter  has no effect, and the only
                     conversion that is done is the format conversion.

                        Examples

                        <b>mpv</b> <b>test.mkv</b> <b>--vf=format:colormatrix=ycgco</b>
                               Results in incorrect colors (if test.mkv was tagged correctly).

                        <b>mpv</b> <b>test.mkv</b> <b>--vf=format:colormatrix=ycgco:convert=yes</b> <b>--sws-allow-zimg</b>
                               Results in true conversion to <b>ycgco</b>, assuming the renderer supports it  (<b>--vo=gpu</b>
                               normally  does).  You  can  add  <b>--vo=xv</b>  to force a VO which definitely does not
                               support it, which should show incorrect colors as confirmation.

                               Using <b>--sws-allow-zimg=no</b> (or disabling zimg at build time) will use  libswscale,
                               which cannot perform this conversion as of this writing.

              <b>&lt;colormatrix&gt;</b>
                     Controls  the  YUV  to  RGB  color  space  conversion when playing video. There are various
                     standards. Normally, BT.601 should be used for SD video, and BT.709 for HD video. (This  is
                     done  by  default.) Using incorrect color space results in slightly under or over saturated
                     and shifted colors.

                     These options are not always supported. Different video outputs provide varying degrees  of
                     support.  The  <b>gpu</b> and <b>vdpau</b> video output drivers usually offer full support. The <b>xv</b> output
                     can set the color space if the system video driver supports it, but not  input  and  output
                     levels.  The <b>scale</b> video filter can configure color space and input levels, but only if the
                     output format is RGB (if the video output driver supports RGB output, you  can  force  this
                     with <b>--vf=scale,format=rgba</b>).

                     If  this option is set to <b>auto</b> (which is the default), the video's color space flag will be
                     used. If that flag is unset, the color space will be selected automatically. This  is  done
                     using  a  simple  heuristic  that  attempts to distinguish SD and HD video. If the video is
                     larger than 1279x576 pixels, BT.709 (HD) will be used; otherwise BT.601 (SD) is selected.

                     Available color spaces are:

              <b>&lt;colorlevels&gt;</b>
                     YUV color levels used with YUV to RGB  conversion.  This  option  is  only  necessary  when
                     playing  broken files which do not follow standard color levels or which are flagged wrong.
                     If the video does not specify its color range, it is assumed to be limited range.

                     The same limitations as with <b>&lt;colormatrix&gt;</b> apply.

                     Available color ranges are:

                     <b>auto</b>   automatic selection (normally limited range) (default)

                     <b>limited</b>
                            limited range (16-235 for luma, 16-240 for chroma)

                     <b>full</b>   full range (0-255 for both luma and chroma)

              <b>&lt;primaries&gt;</b>
                     RGB primaries the source file was encoded with. Normally this should be  set  in  the  file
                     header,  but  when  playing  broken  or  mistagged  files  this can be used to override the
                     setting.

                     This option only affects video output drivers that perform color  management,  for  example
                     <b>gpu</b> with the <b>target-prim</b> or <b>icc-profile</b> suboptions set.

                     If  this  option  is set to <b>auto</b> (which is the default), the video's primaries flag will be
                     used. If that flag is unset, the color space will  be  selected  automatically,  using  the
                     following  heuristics:  If the <b>&lt;colormatrix&gt;</b> is set or determined as BT.2020 or BT.709, the
                     corresponding primaries are used. Otherwise, if the video  height  is  exactly  576  (PAL),
                     BT.601-625  is  used.  If  it's exactly 480 or 486 (NTSC), BT.601-525 is used. If the video
                     resolution is anything else, BT.709 is used.

              <b>&lt;gamma&gt;</b>
                     Gamma function the source file was encoded with. Normally this should be set  in  the  file
                     header,  but  when  playing  broken  or  mistagged  files  this can be used to override the
                     setting.

                     This option only affects video output drivers that perform color management.

                     If this option is set to <b>auto</b> (which is the default), the gamma will be set to BT.1886  for

                     level. This is mostly interesting for HDR, but it can also be used tone map SDR content  to
                     simulate  a  different  exposure.  Normally  inferred from tags such as MaxCLL or mastering
                     metadata.

                     The default of 0.0 will default to the source's nominal peak luminance.

              <b>&lt;light&gt;</b>
                        Light type of the scene. This is mostly correctly inferred based on the gamma  function,
                        but  it  can  be  useful  to override this when viewing raw camera footage (e.g. V-Log),
                        which is normally scene-referred instead of display-referred.

                        Available light types are:

              <b>&lt;hdr10plus=yes|no&gt;</b>
                     Whether  or not to include HDR10+ metadata (default: yes). If disabled, any HDR10+ metadata
                     will be stripped from frames.

              <b>&lt;film-grain=yes|no&gt;</b>
                     Whether or not to include film grain metadata (default: yes). If disabled, any  film  grain
                     metadata will be stripped from frames.

              <b>&lt;chroma-location&gt;</b>
                     Set the chroma loc of the video. Use <b>--vf=format:chroma-location=help</b> to list all available
                     modes.

              <b>&lt;stereo-in&gt;</b>
                     Set  the  stereo mode the video is assumed to be encoded in. Use <b>--vf=format:stereo-in=help</b>
                     to list all available modes. Check with the <b>stereo3d</b> filter documentation to see  what  the
                     names mean.

              <b>&lt;rotate&gt;</b>
                     Set  the rotation the video is assumed to be encoded with in degrees.  The special value <b>-1</b>
                     uses the input format.

              <b>&lt;w&gt;,</b> <b>&lt;h&gt;</b>
                     If not 0, perform conversion to the given size. Ignored if <b>convert=yes</b> is not set.

              <b>&lt;dw&gt;,</b> <b>&lt;dh&gt;</b>
                     Set the display size. Note that setting the display size such that the video is  scaled  in
                     both  directions instead of just changing the aspect ratio is an implementation detail, and
                     might change later.

              <b>&lt;dar&gt;</b>  Set the display aspect ratio of the video frame. This is a float, but values such as <b>[16:9]</b>
                     can be passed too (<b>[...]</b> for quoting to prevent the option parser from interpreting  the  <b>:</b>
                     character).

              <b>&lt;force-scaler=auto|zimg|sws&gt;</b>
                     Force  a  specific  scaler backend, if applicable. This is a debug option and could go away
                     any time.

              <b>&lt;alpha=auto|straight|premul&gt;</b>
                     Set the kind of alpha the video uses. Undefined effect if the image  format  has  no  alpha
                     channel  (could  be  ignored  or  cause  an  error, depending on how mpv internals evolve).
                     Setting this may or may not cause downstream image processing to treat  alpha  differently,
                     depending  on support. With <b>convert</b> and zimg used, this will convert the alpha.  libswscale
                     and other FFmpeg components completely ignore this.

       <b>lavfi=graph[:sws-flags[:o=opts]]</b>
              Filter video using FFmpeg's libavfilter.

              <b>&lt;graph&gt;</b>
                     The libavfilter graph string. The filter must have a single video input pad  and  a  single
                     video output pad.

                     See  &lt;https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html&gt;  for syntax and available filters.

                     <b>WARNING:</b>
                        If you want to use the full filter syntax with this option, you have to quote the filter
                        graph  in  order  to  prevent mpv's syntax and the filter graph syntax from clashing. To
                        prevent a quoting and escaping mess, consider using <b>--lavfi-complex</b> if  you  know  which
                        video  track  you  want  to  use from the input file. (There is only one video track for
                        nearly all video files anyway.)

                        Examples

                        <b>--vf=lavfi=[gradfun=20:30,vflip]</b>
                               <b>gradfun</b> filter with nonsense  parameters,  followed  by  a  <b>vflip</b>  filter.  (This
                               demonstrates  how  libavfilter  takes  a graph and not just a single filter.) The
                               filter graph string is quoted with <b>[</b> and <b>]</b>. This requires no  additional  quoting
                               or  escaping  with  some  shells  (like  bash),  while  others (like zsh) require
                               additional <b>"</b> quotes around the option string.

                        <b>'--vf=lavfi="gradfun=20:30,vflip"'</b>
                               Same as before, but uses quoting that should be safe with all shells. The outer <b>'</b>
                               quotes make sure that the shell does not remove the <b>"</b> quotes needed by mpv.

                        <b>'--vf=lavfi=graph="gradfun=radius=30:strength=20,vflip"'</b>
                               Same as before, but uses named parameters for everything.

              <b>&lt;sws-flags&gt;</b>
                     If libavfilter inserts filters for pixel format conversion, this  option  gives  the  flags
                     which  should  be  passed  to  libswscale.  This  option  is  numeric  and takes a bit-wise
                     combination of <b>SWS_</b> flags.

                     See <b>https://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=blob;f=libswscale/swscale.h</b>.

              <b>&lt;o&gt;</b>    Set AVFilterGraph options. These should be documented by FFmpeg.

                        Example

                        <b>'--vf=lavfi=yadif:o="threads=2,thread_type=slice"'</b>
                               forces a specific threading configuration.

       <b>sub=[=bottom-margin:top-margin]</b>
              Moves subtitle rendering to an arbitrary point in the filter chain, or force subtitle rendering in
              the video filter as opposed to using video output OSD support.

              <b>&lt;bottom-margin&gt;</b>
                     Adds a black band at the bottom of the frame. The  SSA/ASS  renderer  can  place  subtitles
                     there (with <b>--sub-use-margins</b>).

              <b>&lt;top-margin&gt;</b>
                     Black band on the top for toptitles  (with <b>--sub-use-margins</b>).

                 Examples

                 <b>--vf=sub,eq</b>
                        Moves  sub  rendering before the eq filter. This will put both subtitle colors and video
                        under the influence of the video equalizer settings.

       <b>vapoursynth=file:buffered-frames:concurrent-frames:user-data</b>
              Loads a VapourSynth filter script. This is intended for streamed processing: mpv actually provides
              a source filter, instead of using a native VapourSynth video source. The mpv  source  will  answer
              frame  requests  only  within a small window of frames (the size of this window is controlled with
              the <b>buffered-frames</b> parameter), and requests outside of that will  return  errors.  As  such,  you
              can't use the full power of VapourSynth, but you can use certain filters.

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 Do  not  use  this filter, unless you have expert knowledge in VapourSynth, and know how to fix
                 bugs in the mpv VapourSynth wrapper code.

              If you just want to play video generated by VapourSynth (i.e. using  a  native  VapourSynth  video
              source),  it's  better to use <b>vspipe</b> and a pipe or FIFO to feed the video to mpv. The same applies
              if the filter script requires random frame access (see <b>buffered-frames</b> parameter).

              <b>file</b>   Filename of the script  source.  Currently,  this  is  always  a  python  script  (<b>.vpy</b>  in
                     VapourSynth convention).

                     The  variable  <b>video_in</b>  is set to the mpv video source, and it is expected that the script
                     reads video from it. (Otherwise, mpv will decode no video, and the video packet queue  will
                     overflow, eventually leading to only audio playing, or worse.)

                     The  filter  graph  created by the script is also expected to pass through timestamps using
                     the <b>_DurationNum</b> and <b>_DurationDen</b> frame properties.

                     See the end of the option list for a full list of script variables defined by mpv.

                        Example:

                            import vapoursynth as vs
                            from vapoursynth import core
                            core.std.AddBorders(video_in, 10, 10, 20, 20).set_output()

                     <b>WARNING:</b>
                        The script will be reloaded on every seek. This is done to reset the filter properly  on
                        discontinuities.

              <b>buffered-frames</b>
                     Maximum  number of decoded video frames that should be buffered before the filter (default:
                     4). This specifies the maximum  number  of  frames  the  script  can  request  in  backward
                     direction.

                     E.g.  if  <b>buffered-frames=5</b>,  and  the script just requested frame 15, it can still request
                     frame 10, but frame 9 is not available anymore.  If it requests frame 30, mpv  will  decode
                     15 more frames, and keep only frames 25-30.

                     The  only  reason  why  this  buffer  exists  is  to  serve  the random access requests the
                     VapourSynth filter can make.

                     The VapourSynth API has a <b>getFrameAsync</b> function, which takes  an  absolute  frame  number.
                     Source filters must respond to all requests. For example, a source filter can request frame
                     2432,  and  then  frame  3.   Source  filters  typically implement this by pre-indexing the
                     entire file.

                     mpv on the other hand is stream oriented, and does not allow filters to seek. (And it would
                     not make sense to allow  it,  because  it  would  ruin  performance.)  Filters  get  frames
                     sequentially in playback direction, and cannot request them out of order.

                     To  compensate  for  this mismatch, mpv allows the filter to access frames within a certain
                     window. <b>buffered-frames</b> controls the size of this window. Most VapourSynth  filters  happen
                     to  work  with  this, because mpv requests frames sequentially increasing from it, and most
                     filters only require frames "close" to the requested frame.

                     If the filter requests a frame that has a higher frame number  than  the  highest  buffered
                     frame,  new  frames  will be decoded until the requested frame number is reached. Excessive
                     frames will be flushed out in a FIFO manner (there are only at most <b>buffered-frames</b> in this
                     buffer).

                     If the filter requests a frame that has a lower  frame  number  than  the  lowest  buffered
                     frame,  the  request cannot be satisfied, and an error is returned to the filter. This kind
                     of error is not supposed to happen in a  "proper"  VapourSynth  environment.  What  exactly
                     happens depends on the filters involved.

                     Increasing this buffer will not improve performance. Rather, it will waste memory, and slow
                     down  seeks  (when enough frames to fill the buffer need to be decoded at once). It is only
                     needed to prevent the error described in the previous paragraph.

                     How many frames a filter requires depends on filter implementation details, and mpv has  no
                     way of knowing. A scale filter might need only 1 frame, an interpolation filter may require
                     a small number of frames, and the <b>Reverse</b> filter will require an infinite number of frames.

                     If you want reliable operation to the full extend VapourSynth is capable, use <b>vspipe</b>.

                     The  actual  number  of  buffered frames also depends on the value of the <b>concurrent-frames</b>
                     option. Currently, both option values are multiplied to get the final buffer size.

              <b>concurrent-frames</b>
                     Number of frames that should be requested in parallel. The level of concurrency depends  on
                     the  filter  and  how  quickly  mpv  can decode video to feed the filter. This value should
                     probably be proportional to the number of cores on  your  machine.  Most  time,  making  it
                     higher than the number of cores can actually make it slower.

                     Technically,  mpv  will  call the VapourSynth <b>getFrameAsync</b> function in a loop, until there
                     are <b>concurrent-frames</b> frames that have not been returned  by  the  filter  yet.  This  also
                     assumes  that  the  rest of the mpv filter chain reads the output of the <b>vapoursynth</b> filter
                     quickly enough. (For example, if you pause the  player,  filtering  will  stop  very  soon,
                     because the filtered frames are waiting in a queue.)

                     Actual concurrency depends on many other factors.

                     By  default,  this  uses  the  special  value  <b>auto</b>, which sets the option to the number of
                     detected logical CPU cores.

              <b>user-data</b>
                     Optional arbitrary string that is passed to the script. Default to empty string if not set.

              The following <b>.vpy</b> script variables are defined by mpv:

              <b>video_in</b>
                     The mpv video source as vapoursynth clip. Note that  this  has  an  incorrect  (very  high)
                     length  set,  which  confuses  many  filters. This is necessary, because the true number of
                     frames is unknown. You can use the <b>Trim</b> filter on the clip to reduce the length.

              <b>video_in_dw,</b> <b>video_in_dh</b>
                     Display size of the video. Can be different from video size  if  the  video  does  not  use
                     square pixels (e.g. DVD).

              <b>container_fps</b>
                     FPS value as reported by file headers. This value can be wrong or completely broken (e.g. 0
                     or  NaN). Even if the value is correct, if another filter changes the real FPS (by dropping
                     or inserting frames), the value of  this  variable  will  not  be  useful.  Note  that  the
                     <b>--container-fps-override</b> command line option overrides this value.

                     Useful for some filters which insist on having a FPS.

              <b>display_fps</b>
                     Refresh rate of the current display. Note that this value can be 0.

              <b>display_res</b>
                     Resolution  of  the  current  display.  This  is  an  integer  array  with  the first entry
                     corresponding to the width and the second entry corresponding to the height.  These  values
                     can  be  0.  Note  that  this  will  not respond to monitor changes and may not work on all
                     platforms.

              <b>user_data</b>
                     User data passed from the filter. This  variable  always  exists,  and  defaults  to  empty
                     string.

       <b>vavpp</b>  VA-API  video  post  processing. Requires the system to support VA-API, i.e. Linux/BSD only. Works
              with <b>--vo=vaapi</b> and <b>--vo=gpu</b> only.  Currently deinterlaces. This filter is automatically  inserted
              if  deinterlacing  is  requested  (either  using the <b>d</b> key, by default mapped to the command <b>cycle</b>
              <b>deinterlace</b>, or the <b>--deinterlace</b> option).

              <b>deint=&lt;method&gt;</b>
                     Select the deinterlacing algorithm.

                     <b>no</b>     Don't perform deinterlacing.

                     <b>auto</b>   Select the best quality deinterlacing algorithm (default). This goes by the order of
                            the options as documented, with <b>motion-compensated</b> being considered best quality.

                     <b>first-field</b>
                            Show only first field.

                     <b>bob</b>    bob deinterlacing.

                     <b>weave,</b> <b>motion-adaptive,</b> <b>motion-compensated</b>
                            Advanced deinterlacing algorithms. Whether these actually work depends  on  the  GPU
                            hardware, the GPU drivers, driver bugs, and mpv bugs.

              <b>&lt;interlaced-only&gt;</b>

                     <b>no</b>     Deinterlace all frames (default).

                     <b>yes</b>    Only deinterlace frames marked as interlaced.

              <b>reversal-bug=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>

                     <b>no</b>     Use  the  API as it was interpreted by older Mesa drivers. While this interpretation
                            was more obvious and intuitive, it was apparently wrong, and  not  shared  by  Intel
                            driver developers.

                     <b>yes</b>    Use Intel interpretation of surface forward and backwards references (default). This
                            is  what  Intel drivers and newer Mesa drivers expect. Matters only for the advanced
                            deinterlacing algorithms.

       <b>vdpaupp</b>
              VDPAU video post processing. Works with <b>--vo=vdpau</b> and <b>--vo=gpu</b> only. This filter is automatically
              inserted if deinterlacing is requested (either using the <b>d</b> key, by default mapped to  the  command
              <b>cycle</b>  <b>deinterlace</b>,  or  the  <b>--deinterlace</b>  option).  When  enabling  deinterlacing, it is always
              preferred over software deinterlacer filters if the <b>vdpau</b> VO is used, and also if <b>gpu</b> is used  and
              hardware decoding was activated at least once (i.e. vdpau was loaded).

              <b>sharpen=&lt;-1-1&gt;</b>
                     For  positive  values,  apply  a  sharpening  algorithm to the video, for negative values a
                     blurring algorithm (default: 0).

              <b>denoise=&lt;0-1&gt;</b>
                     Apply a noise reduction algorithm to the video (default: 0; no noise reduction).

              <b>deint=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
                     Whether deinterlacing is enabled (default: no). If enabled, it will use the  mode  selected
                     with <b>deint-mode</b>.

              <b>deint-mode=&lt;first-field|bob|temporal|temporal-spatial&gt;</b>
                     Select deinterlacing mode (default: temporal).

                     Note  that  there's currently a mechanism that allows the <b>vdpau</b> VO to change the <b>deint-mode</b>
                     of auto-inserted <b>vdpaupp</b> filters. To avoid confusion,  it's  recommended  not  to  use  the
                     <b>--vo=vdpau</b> suboptions related to filtering.

                     <b>first-field</b>
                            Show only first field.

                     <b>bob</b>    Bob deinterlacing.

                     <b>temporal</b>
                            Motion-adaptive  temporal  deinterlacing.  May  lead  to  A/V desync with slow video
                            hardware and/or high resolution.

                     <b>temporal-spatial</b>
                            Motion-adaptive temporal deinterlacing with edge-guided spatial interpolation. Needs
                            fast video hardware.

              <b>chroma-deint</b>
                     Makes  temporal  deinterlacers  operate  both  on   luma   and   chroma   (default).    Use
                     no-chroma-deint  to  solely  use luma and speed up advanced deinterlacing. Useful with slow
                     video memory.

              <b>pullup</b> Try to apply inverse telecine, needs motion adaptive temporal deinterlacing.

              <b>interlaced-only=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
                     If <b>yes</b>, only deinterlace frames marked as interlaced (default: no).

              <b>hqscaling=&lt;0-9&gt;</b>

                     <b>0</b>      Use default VDPAU scaling (default).

                     <b>1-9</b>    Apply high quality VDPAU scaling (needs capable hardware).

       <b>d3d11vpp</b>
              Direct3D 11 video post-processing. Requires a D3D11 context and works best with hardware decoding.
              Software frames are automatically uploaded to hardware for processing.

              <b>format</b> Convert to the selected image format, e.g.,  nv12,  p010,  etc.  (default:  don't  change).
                     Format  names  can  be  queried  with  <b>--vf=d3d11vpp=format=help</b>.  Note that only a limited
                     subset is supported, and actual support depends on your hardware. Normally, this  shouldn't
                     be  changed  unless some processing only works with a specific format, in which case it can
                     be selected here.

              <b>deint=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
                     Whether deinterlacing is enabled (default: no).

              <b>scale</b>  Scaling factor for the video frames (default: 1.0).

              <b>scaling-mode=&lt;standard,intel,nvidia&gt;</b>
                     Select the scaling mode to be used. Note that this only enables the appropriate  processing
                     extensions;  whether  it actually works or not depends on your hardware and the settings in
                     your GPU driver's control panel (default: standard).

                     <b>standard</b>
                            Default scaling mode as decided by d3d11vpp implementation.

                     <b>intel</b>  Intel Video Super Resolution.

                     <b>nvidia</b> NVIDIA RTX Super Resolution.

              <b>interlaced-only=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
                     If <b>yes</b>, only deinterlace frames marked as interlaced (default: no).

              <b>mode=&lt;blend|bob|adaptive|mocomp|ivctc|none&gt;</b>
                     Tries to select a video processor  with  the  given  processing  capability.   If  a  video
                     processor  supports  multiple  capabilities,  it  is  not clear which algorithm is actually
                     selected. <b>none</b> always falls back. On most if not all hardware, this option will probably do
                     nothing, because a video processor usually supports all modes or none.

              <b>nvidia-true-hdr</b>
                     Enable NVIDIA RTX Video HDR processing.

       <b>fingerprint=...</b>
              Compute video frame fingerprints and provide them  as  metadata.  Actually,  it  currently  barely
              deserved  to  be  called <b>fingerprint</b>, because it does not compute "proper" fingerprints, only tiny
              downscaled images (but which can be used to compute image hashes or for similarity matching).

              The main purpose of this filter is to  support  the  <b>skip-logo.lua</b>  script.   If  this  script  is
              dropped,  or  mpv  ever  gains  a  way to load user-defined filters (other than VapourSynth), this
              filter will be removed. Due to the "special" nature of this filter, it  will  be  removed  without
              warning.

              The  intended  way  to  read  from the filter is using <b>vf-metadata</b> (also see <b>clear-on-query</b> filter
              parameter). The property will return a list of key/value pairs as follows:

                 fp0.pts = 1.2345
                 fp0.hex = 1234abcdef...bcde
                 fp1.pts = 1.4567
                 fp1.hex = abcdef1234...6789
                 ...
                 fpN.pts = ...
                 fpN.hex = ...
                 type = gray-hex-16x16

              Each <b>fp&lt;N&gt;</b> entry is for a frame. The <b>pts</b> entry specifies the timestamp of the  frame  (within  the
              filter chain; in simple cases this is the same as the display timestamp). The <b>hex</b> field is the hex
              encoded  fingerprint, whose size and meaning depend on the <b>type</b> filter option.  The <b>type</b> field has
              the same value as the option the filter was created with.

              This  returns  the  frames  that  were  filtered  since  the  last  query  of  the  property.   If
              <b>clear-on-query=no</b>  was  set, a query doesn't reset the list of frames. In both cases, a maximum of
              10 frames is returned. If there are more frames, the  oldest  frames  are  discarded.  Frames  are
              returned in filter order.

              (This  doesn't  return  a  structured  list for the per-frame details because the internals of the
              <b>vf-metadata</b> mechanism suck. The returned format may change in the future.)

              This filter uses zimg for speed and profit. However, it will fallback to libswscale in a number of
              situations: lesser pixel formats, unaligned  data  pointers  or  strides,  or  if  zimg  fails  to
              initialize for unknown reasons. In these cases, the filter will use more CPU. Also, it will output
              different  fingerprints,  because  libswscale  cannot perform the full range expansion we normally
              request from zimg. As a consequence, the filter may be slower and not  work  correctly  in  random
              situations.

              <b>type=...</b>
                     What fingerprint to compute. Available types are:

                     <b>gray-hex-8x8</b>
                            grayscale, 8 bit, 8x8 size

                     <b>gray-hex-16x16</b>
                            grayscale, 8 bit, 16x16 size (default)

                     Both types simply remove all colors, downscale the image, concatenate all pixel values to a
                     byte array, and convert the array to a hex string.

              <b>clear-on-query=yes|no</b>
                     Clear the list of frame fingerprints if the <b>vf-metadata</b> property for this filter is queried
                     (default: yes). This requires some care by the user. Some types of accesses might query the
                     filter multiple times, which leads to lost frames.

              <b>print=yes|no</b>
                     Print  computed  fingerprints to the terminal (default: no). This is mostly for testing and
                     such. Scripts should use <b>vf-metadata</b> to read information from this filter instead.

       <b>gpu=...</b>
              Convert video to RGB using the Vulkan or OpenGL renderer normally used with <b>--vo=gpu</b>. In  case  of
              OpenGL,  this  requires  that  the EGL implementation supports off-screen rendering on the default
              display. (This is the case with Mesa.)

              Sub-options:

              <b>api=&lt;type&gt;</b>
                     The value <b>type</b> selects the rendering API. You can also pass <b>help</b> to get a complete list  of
                     compiled in backends.

                     <b>egl</b>    EGL (default if available)

                     <b>vulkan</b> Vulkan

              <b>w=&lt;pixels&gt;,</b> <b>h=&lt;pixels&gt;</b>
                     Size  of  the output in pixels (default: 0). If not positive, this will use the size of the
                     first filtered input frame.

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 This is highly experimental. Performance is bad, and it will not work everywhere in  the  first
                 place. Some features are not supported.

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 This  does  not  do OSD rendering. If you see OSD, then it has been rendered by the VO backend.
                 (Subtitles are rendered by the <b>gpu</b> filter, if possible.)

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 If you use this with encoding mode, keep in mind  that  encoding  mode  will  convert  the  RGB
                 filter's  output  back to yuv420p in software, using the configured software scaler. Using <b>zimg</b>
                 might improve this, but in any case it might go against your goals when using this filter.

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 Do not use this with <b>--vo=gpu</b>. It will apply filtering twice, since most <b>--vo=gpu</b>  options  are
                 unconditionally applied to the <b>gpu</b> filter. There is no mechanism in mpv to prevent this.

</pre><h4><b>ENCODING</b></h4><pre>

                 <b>"--ovc=libx264</b> <b>--ovcopts=crf=23"</b>
                        selects VBR quality factor 23 for H.264 encoding.

              This is a key/value list option. See List Options for details.

              <b>--ovcopts-add=&lt;option&gt;</b>
                     Appends  the  option given as an argument to the options list. (Passing multiple options is
                     currently still possible, but deprecated.)

              <b>--ovcopts=""</b>
                     Completely empties the options list.

       <b>--orawts</b>
              Copies input pts to the output video (not supported by some output container formats,  e.g.  AVI).
              In  this  mode,  discontinuities  are  not  fixed and all pts are passed through as-is. Never seek
              backwards or use multiple input files in this mode!

       <b>--ocopy-metadata=&lt;yes|no&gt;</b>
              Copy metadata from input files to output files when encoding (default: yes).

       <b>--oset-metadata=&lt;metadata-tag[,metadata-tag,...]&gt;</b>
              Specifies metadata to include in the output file.  Supported keys vary between output formats. For
              example, Matroska (MKV) and FLAC allow almost arbitrary keys, while support in MP4 and MP3 is more
              limited.

              This is a key/value list option. See List Options for details.

                 Example

                 <b>"--oset-metadata=title="Output</b> <b>title",comment="Another</b> <b>tag""</b>
                        adds a title and a comment to the output file.

       <b>--oremove-metadata=&lt;metadata-tag[,metadata-tag,...]&gt;</b>
              Specifies metadata to exclude from the output file when copying from the input file.

              This is a string list option. See List Options for details.

                 Example

                 <b>"--oremove-metadata=comment,genre"</b>
                        excludes copying of the the comment and genre tags to the output file.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       The mpv core can be controlled with commands and properties. A number of ways to interact with the player
       use them: key bindings (<b>input.conf</b>), OSD (showing information with properties), JSON IPC, the client  API
       (<b>libmpv</b>), and the classic slave mode.

   <b>input.conf</b>
       The input.conf file consists of a list of key bindings, for example:

          s screenshot      # take a screenshot with the s key
          LEFT seek 15      # map the left-arrow key to seeking forward by 15 seconds

       Each  line  maps  a  key  to an input command. Keys are specified with their literal value (upper case if
       combined with <b>Shift</b>), or a name for special keys. For example, <b>a</b> maps to the <b>a</b> key without shift,  and  <b>A</b>
       maps to <b>a</b> with shift.

       The file is located in the mpv configuration directory (normally at <b><a href="file:~/.config/mpv/input.conf">~/.config/mpv/input.conf</a></b> depending on
       platform). The default bindings are defined here:

          https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/etc/input.conf

       A list of special keys can be obtained with
          <b>mpv</b> <b>--input-keylist</b>

       In general, keys can be combined with <b>Shift</b>, <b>Ctrl</b> and <b>Alt</b>:

          ctrl+q quit

       <b>mpv</b>  can  be started in input test mode, which displays key bindings and the commands they're bound to on
       the OSD, instead of executing the commands:

          mpv --input-test --force-window --idle

       (Only closing the window will make <b>mpv</b> exit, pressing normal keys will merely display the  binding,  even
       if mapped to quit.)

       Also see Key names.

   <b>input.conf</b> <b>syntax</b>
       <b>[Shift+][Ctrl+][Alt+][Meta+]&lt;key&gt;</b> <b>[{&lt;section&gt;}]</b> <b>&lt;command&gt;</b> <b>(</b> <b>;</b> <b>&lt;command&gt;</b> <b>)*</b>

       Note  that  by  default,  the  right  Alt key can be used to create special characters, and thus does not
       register as a modifier. This can be changed with <b>--input-right-alt-gr</b> option.

       Newlines always start a new binding. <b>#</b> starts a comment (outside of quoted  string  arguments).  To  bind
       commands to the <b>#</b> key, <b>SHARP</b> can be used.

       <b>&lt;key&gt;</b>  is  either the literal character the key produces (ASCII or Unicode character), or a symbolic name
       (as printed by <b>--input-keylist</b>).

       <b>&lt;section&gt;</b> (braced with <b>{</b> and <b>}</b>) is the input section for this command.

       <b>&lt;command&gt;</b> is the command itself. It consists of the command name and multiple (or  none)  arguments,  all
       separated by whitespace. String arguments should be quoted, typically with <b>"</b>. See <b>Flat</b> <b>command</b> <b>syntax</b>.

       You can bind multiple commands to one key. For example:
       a show-text "command 1" ; show-text "command 2"

       It's also possible to bind a command to a sequence of keys:
       a-b-c show-text "command run after a, b, c have been pressed"

       (This is not shown in the general command syntax.)

       If  <b>a</b>  or  <b>a-b</b>  or  <b>b</b>  are already bound, this will run the first command that matches, and the multi-key
       command will never be called. Intermediate keys can be remapped to <b>ignore</b> in order to avoid  this  issue.
       The maximum number of (non-modifier) keys for combinations is currently 4.

   <b>Key</b> <b>names</b>
       All  mouse  and  keyboard  input  is to converted to mpv-specific key names. Key names are either special
       symbolic identifiers representing a physical key, or text  key  names,  which  are  Unicode  code  points
       encoded  as  UTF-8.  These  are  what keyboard input would normally produce, for example <b>a</b> for the A key.
       These are influenced by keyboard modifiers which affect produced text, such as shift and caps lock. As  a
       consequence,  mpv  uses  input  translated  by  the current OS keyboard layout, rather than physical scan
       codes.

       Currently there is the hardcoded assumption that every text key can be represented as  a  single  Unicode
       code point (in NFKC form).

       All  key  names  can  be combined with the modifiers <b>Shift</b>, <b>Ctrl</b>, <b>Alt</b>, <b>Meta</b>. They must be prefixed to the
       actual key name, where each modifier is followed by a <b>+</b> (for example <b>ctrl+q</b>).

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The <b>Shift</b> modifier requires some attention. In general, when the <b>Shift</b> modifier is combined with a key
          which produces text, the actual produced text key name when shift is pressed should be used.

          For instance, on the US keyboard layout,  <b>Shift+2</b>  should  usually  be  specified  as  key-name  <b>@</b>  at
          <b>input.conf</b>, and similarly the combination <b>Alt+Shift+2</b> is usually <b>Alt+@</b>, etc.

          In  general,  the  <b>Shift</b>  modifier,  when specified with text key names, is ignored: for instance, mpv
          interprets <b>Shift+2</b> as <b>2</b>.  The only exceptions are ASCII letters, which are  normalized  by  mpv.   For
          example, <b>Shift+a</b> is interpreted as <b>A</b>.

          Special  key  names  like  <b>Shift+LEFT</b> work as expected.  If in doubt - use <b>--input-test</b> to check how a
          key/combination is seen by mpv.

       Symbolic key names and modifier names are case-insensitive. Unicode key  names  are  case-sensitive  just
       like how keyboard text input would produce.

       Another  type  of  key  names are hexadecimal key names, which start with <b>0x</b>, followed by the hexadecimal
       value of the key. The hexadecimal value can be either a  Unicode  code  point  value,  or  can  serve  as
       fallback  for  special  keys  that do not have a special mpv defined name. They will break as soon as mpv
       adds proper names for them, but can enable you to use a key at all if that does not happen.

       All symbolic names are listed by <b>--input-keylist</b>. <b>--input-test</b> is a special mode that prints all input on
       the OSD.

       Comments on some symbolic names:

       <b>KP*</b>    Keypad names. Behavior varies by backend (whether they implement  this,  and  on  how  they  treat
              numlock),  but  typically,  mpv  tries  to  map keys on the keypad to separate names, even if they
              produce the same text as normal keys.

       <b>MOUSE_BTN*,</b> <b>MBTN*</b>
              Various mouse buttons.

              Depending on backend, the mouse wheel might  also  be  represented  as  a  button.   In  addition,
              <b>MOUSE_BTN3</b> to <b>MOUSE_BTN6</b> are deprecated aliases for <b>WHEEL_UP</b>, <b>WHEEL_DOWN</b>, <b>WHEEL_LEFT</b>, <b>WHEEL_RIGHT</b>.

              <b>MBTN*</b> are aliases for <b>MOUSE_BTN*</b>.

       <b>WHEEL_*</b>
              Mouse wheels and touch pads (typically).

              These  key  are  scalable  when  used  with  scalable  commands  if the underlying device supports
              high-resolution scrolling (e.g. touch pads).

       <b>AXIS_*</b> Deprecated aliases for <b>WHEEL_*</b>.

       <b>*_DBL</b>  Mouse button double clicks.

       <b>MOUSE_MOVE,</b> <b>MOUSE_ENTER,</b> <b>MOUSE_LEAVE</b>
              Emitted by mouse move events. Enter/leave happens when the mouse enters or leave  the  mpv  window
              (or the current mouse region, using the deprecated mouse region input section mechanism).

       <b>CLOSE_WIN</b>
              Pseudo  key  emitted  when  closing  the  mpv  window using the OS window manager (for example, by
              clicking the close button in the window title bar).

       <b>GAMEPAD_*</b>
              Keys emitted by the SDL gamepad backend.

       <b>UNMAPPED</b>
              Pseudo-key that matches any unmapped key. (You should probably avoid this if possible, because  it
              might change behavior or get removed in the future.)

       <b>ANY_UNICODE</b>
              Pseudo-key  that  matches any key that produces text. (You should probably avoid this if possible,
              because it might change behavior or get removed in the future.)

   <b>Flat</b> <b>command</b> <b>syntax</b>
       This is the syntax used in input.conf, and referred to "input.conf syntax" in a number of other places.

       <b>&lt;command&gt;</b>  <b>::=</b> <b>[&lt;prefixes&gt;]</b> <b>&lt;command_name&gt;</b> <b>(&lt;argument&gt;)*</b>
       <b>&lt;argument&gt;</b> <b>::=</b> <b>(&lt;unquoted&gt;</b> <b>|</b> <b>"</b> <b>&lt;double_quoted&gt;</b> <b>"</b> <b>|</b> <b>'</b> <b>&lt;single_quoted&gt;</b> <b>'</b> <b>|</b> <b>`X</b> <b>&lt;custom_quoted&gt;</b> <b>X`)</b>

       <b>command_name</b> is an unquoted string with the command name itself. See List of Input Commands for a list.

       Arguments are separated by whitespaces even if the command expects  only  one  argument.  Arguments  with
       whitespaces or other special characters must be quoted, or the command cannot be parsed correctly.

       Double  quotes interpret JSON/C-style escaping, like <b>\t</b> or <b>\"</b> or <b>\\</b>.  JSON escapes according to RFC 8259,
       minus surrogate pair escapes. This is the only form which allows newlines at the value - as <b>\n</b>.

       Single quotes take the content literally, and cannot include the single-quote character at the value.

       Custom quotes also take the content literally, but are more flexible than single quotes. They start  with
       <b>`</b>  (back-quote)  followed  by  any  ASCII  character, and end at the first occurrence of the same pair in
       reverse order, e.g.  <b>`-foo-`</b> or <b>``bar``</b>. The final pair sequence is not allowed at the value -  in  these
       examples  <b>-`</b>  and  <b>``</b> respectively. In the second example the last character of the value also can't be a
       back-quote.

       Mixed quoting at the same argument, like <b>'foo'"bar"</b>, is not supported.

       Note that argument parsing and property expansion happen  at  different  stages.   First,  arguments  are
       determined  as  described  above,  and  then,  where  applicable, properties are expanded - regardless of
       argument quoting. However, expansion can still be prevented with the <b>raw</b> prefix or <b>$&gt;</b>. See Input  Command
       Prefixes and Property Expansion.

   <b>Commands</b> <b>specified</b> <b>as</b> <b>arrays</b>
       This applies to certain APIs, such as <b>mp.commandv()</b> or <b>mp.command_native()</b> (with array parameters) in Lua
       scripting,  or  <b>mpv_command()</b>  or  <b>mpv_command_node()</b> (with MPV_FORMAT_NODE_ARRAY) in the C libmpv client
       API.

       The command as well as all arguments are passed as a single array. Similar to the  Flat  command  syntax,
       you  can  first  pass prefixes as strings (each as separate array item), then the command name as string,
       and then each argument as string or a native value.

       Since these APIs pass arguments as separate strings or native values, they do not expect quotes,  and  do
       support escaping. Technically, there is the input.conf parser, which first splits the command string into
       arguments,  and  then  invokes argument parsers for each argument. The input.conf parser normally handles
       quotes and escaping. The array command APIs  mentioned  above  pass  strings  directly  to  the  argument
       parsers, or can sidestep them by the ability to pass non-string values.

       Property  expansion is disabled by default for these APIs. This can be changed with the <b>expand-properties</b>
       prefix. See Input Command Prefixes.

       Sometimes commands have string arguments, that in turn are actually  parsed  by  other  components  (e.g.
       filter  strings with <b>vf</b> <b>add</b>) - in these cases, you you would have to double-escape in input.conf, but not
       with the array APIs.

       For  complex  commands,  consider  using  Named  arguments  instead,  which  should  give  slightly  more
       compatibility. Some commands do not support named arguments and inherently take an array, though.

   <b>Named</b> <b>arguments</b>
       This  applies  to  certain  APIs,  such as <b>mp.command_native()</b> (with tables that have string keys) in Lua
       scripting, or <b>mpv_command_node()</b> (with MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP) in the C libmpv client API.

       The name of the command is provided with a <b>name</b> string field. The name of each command is defined in each
       command description in the List of Input Commands. <b>--input-cmdlist</b> also lists them.  See  the  <b>subprocess</b>
       command for an example.

       Some commands do not support named arguments (e.g. <b>run</b> command). You need to use APIs that pass arguments
       as arrays.

       Named  arguments  are  not supported in the "flat" input.conf syntax, which means you cannot use them for
       key bindings in input.conf at all.

       Property expansion is disabled by default for these APIs. This can be changed with the  <b>expand-properties</b>
       prefix. See Input Command Prefixes.

   <b>List</b> <b>of</b> <b>Input</b> <b>Commands</b>
       Commands  with  parameters  have  the  parameter  name  enclosed in <b>&lt;</b> / <b>&gt;</b>.  Don't add those to the actual
       command. Optional arguments are enclosed in <b>[</b> / <b>]</b>. If you don't pass them, they will be set to a  default
       value.

       Remember to quote string arguments in input.conf (see Flat command syntax).

   <b>Playback</b> <b>Control</b>
       <b>seek</b> <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;flags&gt;]</b>
              Change the playback position. By default, seeks by a relative amount of seconds.

              The second argument consists of flags controlling the seek mode:

              <b>relative</b> <b>(default)</b>
                     Seek relative to current position (a negative value seeks backwards).

              <b>absolute</b>
                     Seek to a given time (a negative value starts from the end of the file).

              <b>absolute-percent</b>
                     Seek to a given percent position.

              <b>relative-percent</b>
                     Seek relative to current position in percent.

              <b>keyframes</b>
                     Always restart playback at keyframe boundaries (fast).

              <b>exact</b>  Always do exact/hr/precise seeks (slow).

              Multiple flags can be combined, e.g.: <b>absolute+keyframes</b>.

              By  default,  <b>keyframes</b>  is used for <b>relative</b>, <b>relative-percent</b>, and <b>absolute-percent</b> seeks, while
              <b>exact</b> is used for <b>absolute</b> seeks.

              Before mpv 0.9, the <b>keyframes</b> and <b>exact</b> flags had to be passed as 3rd parameter (essentially using
              a space instead of <b>+</b>). The 3rd parameter is still parsed, but is considered deprecated.

              This is a scalable command. See the documentation of <b>nonscalable</b> input  command  prefix  in  Input
              Command Prefixes for details.

       <b>revert-seek</b> <b>[&lt;flags&gt;]</b>
              Undoes  the  <b>seek</b>  command,  and  some other commands that seek (but not necessarily all of them).
              Calling this command once will jump to the playback position before the seek. Calling it a  second
              time undoes the <b>revert-seek</b> command itself. This only works within a single file.

              The first argument is optional, and can change the behavior:

              <b>mark</b>   Mark  the current time position. The next normal <b>revert-seek</b> command will seek back to this
                     point, no matter how many seeks happened since last time.

              <b>mark-permanent</b>
                     If set, mark the current position, and do not change the  mark  position  before  the  next
                     <b>revert-seek</b>  command  that  has <b>mark</b> or <b>mark-permanent</b> set (or playback of the current file
                     ends). Until this happens, <b>revert-seek</b> will always seek to  the  marked  point.  This  flag
                     cannot be combined with <b>mark</b>.

              Using it without any arguments gives you the default behavior.

       <b>sub-seek</b> <b>&lt;skip&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;flags&gt;]</b>
              Change  video  and  audio  position  such  that the subtitle event after <b>&lt;skip&gt;</b> subtitle events is
              displayed. For example, <b>sub-seek</b> <b>1</b> skips to the next subtitle, <b>sub-seek</b> <b>-1</b> skips to  the  previous
              subtitles, and <b>sub-seek</b> <b>0</b> seeks to the beginning of the current subtitle.

              This  is  similar  to  <b>sub-step</b>,  except  that  it  seeks video and audio instead of adjusting the
              subtitle delay.

              Secondary argument:

              <b>primary</b> <b>(default)</b>
                     Seeks through the primary subtitles.

              <b>secondary</b>
                     Seeks through the secondary subtitles.

              For embedded subtitles (like with Matroska), this  works  only  with  subtitle  events  that  have
              already  been  displayed,  or  are  within a short prefetch range. See Cache for details on how to
              control the available prefetch range.

       <b>frame-step</b> <b>[&lt;frames&gt;]</b> <b>[&lt;flags&gt;]</b>
              Go forward or backwards by a given amount of frames. If <b>&lt;frames&gt;</b> is omitted, the value is  assumed
              to be <b>1</b>.

              The second argument consists of flags controlling the frameskip mode:

              <b>play</b> <b>(default)</b>
                     Play  the  video  forward  by the desired amount of frames and then pause.  This only works
                     with a positive value (i.e. frame stepping forwards).

              <b>seek</b>   Perform a very exact seek that attempts to  seek  by  the  desired  amount  of  frames.  If
                     <b>&lt;frames&gt;</b> is <b>-1</b>, this will go exactly to the previous frame.

              <b>mute</b>   The  same  as  <b>play</b>  but  mutes the audio stream if there is any during the duration of the
                     frame step.

              Note that the default frameskip mode, play, is more accurate but can be slow depending on how many
              frames you are skipping (i.e. skipping forward 100 frames will play 100  frames  of  video  before
              stopping). This mode only works when going forwards. Frame stepping back always performs a seek.

              When  using  seek  mode,  this  can  still  be  very  slow (it tries to be precise, not fast), and
              sometimes fails to behave as expected. How well this works  depends  on  whether  precise  seeking
              works  correctly  (e.g.  see  the  <b>--hr-seek-demuxer-offset</b>  option). Video filters or other video
              post-processing that modifies timing of frames (e.g. deinterlacing) should usually work, but might
              make framestepping silently behave  incorrectly  in  corner  cases.  Using  <b>--hr-seek-framedrop=no</b>
              should  help,  although  it  might  make  precise  seeking  slower.  Also  if  the  video  is VFR,
              framestepping using seeks will probably not work correctly except for the <b>-1</b> case.

              This does not work with audio-only playback.

       <b>frame-back-step</b>
              Calls <b>frame-step</b> with a value of <b>-1</b> and the <b>seek</b> flag.

              This does not work with audio-only playback.

       <b>stop</b> <b>[&lt;flags&gt;]</b>
              Stop playback and clear playlist. With default settings, this is essentially like <b>quit</b>. Useful for
              the client API: playback can be stopped without terminating the player.

              The first argument is optional, and supports the following flags:

              <b>keep-playlist</b>
                     Do not clear the playlist.

   <b>Property</b> <b>Manipulation</b>
       <b>set</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Set the given property or option to the given value.

       <b>del</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>
              Delete the given property. Most properties cannot be deleted.

       <b>add</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;value&gt;]</b>
              Add the given value to the property or option. On overflow or underflow, clamp the property to the
              maximum. If <b>&lt;value&gt;</b> is omitted, assume <b>1</b>.

              Whether or not key-repeat is enabled by default depends on  the  property.   Currently  properties
              with  continuous  values  are  repeatable  by default (like <b>volume</b>), while discrete values are not
              (like <b>osd-level</b>).

              This is a scalable command. See the documentation of <b>nonscalable</b> input  command  prefix  in  Input
              Command Prefixes for details.

       <b>multiply</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Similar to <b>add</b>, but multiplies the property or option with the numeric value.

       <b>cycle</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;value&gt;]</b>
              Cycle  the  given  property  or  option.  The  second  argument can be <b>up</b> or <b>down</b> to set the cycle
              direction. On overflow, set the property back to the minimum, on underflow set it to the  maximum.
              If <b>up</b> or <b>down</b> is omitted, assume <b>up</b>.

              Whether  or  not  key-repeat  is enabled by default depends on the property.  Currently properties
              with continuous values are repeatable by default (like <b>volume</b>),  while  discrete  values  are  not
              (like <b>osd-level</b>).

              This  is  a  scalable  command. See the documentation of <b>nonscalable</b> input command prefix in Input
              Command Prefixes for details.

       <b>cycle-values</b> <b>[&lt;"!reverse"&gt;]</b> <b>&lt;property&gt;</b> <b>&lt;value1&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;value2&gt;</b> <b>[...]]</b>
              Cycle through a list of values. Each invocation of the command will set the given property to  the
              next  value in the list. The command will use the current value of the property/option, and use it
              to determine the current position in the list of values. Once it has found it,  it  will  set  the
              next value in the list (wrapping around to the first item if needed).

              This command has a variable number of arguments, and cannot be used with named arguments.

              The  special  argument <b>!reverse</b> can be used to cycle the value list in reverse. The only advantage
              is that you don't need to reverse the value list yourself when adding a  second  key  binding  for
              cycling backwards.

       <b>change-list</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>&lt;operation&gt;</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
              This command changes list options as described in List Options. The <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> parameter is the normal
              option name, while <b>&lt;operation&gt;</b> is the suffix or action used on the option.

              Some operations take no value, but the command still requires the value parameter. In these cases,
              the value must be an empty string.

                 Example

                        <b>change-list</b> <b>glsl-shaders</b> <b>append</b> <b>file.glsl</b>

                        Add   a   filename   to   the   <b>glsl-shaders</b>   list.  The  command  line  equivalent  is
                        <b>--glsl-shaders-append=file.glsl</b> or alternatively <b>--glsl-shader=file.glsl</b>.

   <b>Playlist</b> <b>Manipulation</b>
       <b>playlist-next</b> <b>[&lt;flags&gt;]</b>
              Go to the next entry on the playlist.

              First argument:

              <b>weak</b> <b>(default)</b>
                     If the last file on the playlist is currently played, do nothing.

              <b>force</b>  Terminate playback if there are no more files on the playlist.

       <b>playlist-prev</b> <b>[&lt;flags&gt;]</b>
              Go to the previous entry on the playlist.

              First argument:

              <b>weak</b> <b>(default)</b>
                     If the first file on the playlist is currently played, do nothing.

              <b>force</b>  Terminate playback if the first file is being played.

       <b>playlist-next-playlist</b>
              Go to the next entry on the playlist with a different <b>playlist-path</b>.

       <b>playlist-prev-playlist</b>
              Go to the first of the previous entries on the playlist with a different <b>playlist-path</b>.

       <b>playlist-play-index</b> <b>&lt;integer|current|none&gt;</b>
              Start (or restart) playback of the given playlist index. In addition to the 0-based playlist entry
              index, it supports the following values:

              <b>&lt;current&gt;</b>
                     The current playlist entry (as in <b>playlist-current-pos</b>) will be played  again  (unload  and
                     reload).  If  none is set, playback is stopped.  (In corner cases, <b>playlist-current-pos</b> can
                     point to a playlist entry even if playback is currently inactive,

              <b>&lt;none&gt;</b> Playback is stopped. If idle mode (<b>--idle</b>) is enabled, the player  will  enter  idle  mode,
                     otherwise it will exit.

              This  command  is  similar to <b>loadfile</b> in that it only manipulates the state of what to play next,
              without waiting until the current file is unloaded, and the next one is loaded.

              Setting <b>playlist-pos</b> or similar properties can have a similar effect  to  this  command.  However,
              it's  more  explicit,  and  guarantees  that playback is restarted if for example the new playlist
              entry is the same as the previous one.

       <b>loadfile</b> <b>&lt;url&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;flags&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;index&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;options&gt;]]]</b>
              Load the given file or URL and play it. Technically, this is just a playlist manipulation  command
              (which  either  replaces  the  playlist  or  adds  an  entry  to  it). Actual file loading happens
              independently. For example, a <b>loadfile</b> command that replaces the  current  file  with  a  new  one
              returns before the current file is stopped, and the new file even begins loading.

              Second argument:

              <b>&lt;replace&gt;</b> <b>(default)</b>
                     Stop playback of the current file, and play the new file immediately.

              <b>&lt;append&gt;</b>
                     Append the file to the playlist.

              <b>&lt;append-play&gt;</b>
                     Append  the file, and if nothing is currently playing, start playback.  (Always starts with
                     the added file, even if the playlist was not empty before running this command.)

              <b>&lt;insert-next&gt;</b>
                     Insert the file into the playlist, directly after the current entry.

              <b>&lt;insert-next-play&gt;</b>
                     Insert the file next, and if nothing is currently playing, start playback.  (Always  starts
                     with the added file, even if the playlist was not empty before running this command.)

              <b>&lt;insert-at&gt;</b>
                     Insert the file into the playlist, at the index given in the third argument.

              <b>&lt;insert-at-play&gt;</b>
                     Insert  the  file  at  the  index  given in the third argument, and if nothing is currently
                     playing, start playback. (Always starts with the added file, even if the playlist  was  not
                     empty before running this command.)

              The  third  argument is an insertion index, used only by the <b>insert-at</b> and <b>insert-at-play</b> actions.
              When used with those actions, the new item will be inserted at the index position in the playlist,
              or appended to the end if index is less than 0 or greater than the  size  of  the  playlist.  This
              argument will be ignored for all other actions. This argument is added in mpv 0.38.0.

              The fourth argument is a list of options and values which should be set while the file is playing.
              It  is  of  the  form  <b>opt1=value1,opt2=value2,..</b>.   When  using  the  client  API,  this can be a
              <b>MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP</b> (or a Lua table), however the values themselves  must  be  strings  currently.
              These  options are set during playback, and restored to the previous value at end of playback (see
              Per-File Options).

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 Since mpv 0.38.0, an insertion index argument is added as the third argument.  This breaks  all
                 existing  uses of this command which make use of the argument to include the list of options to
                 be set while the file is playing. To address this problem, the third argument now needs  to  be
                 set to -1 if the fourth argument needs to be used.

       <b>loadlist</b> <b>&lt;url&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;flags&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;index&gt;]]</b>
              Load the given playlist file or URL (like <b>--playlist</b>).

              Second argument:

              <b>&lt;replace&gt;</b> <b>(default)</b>
                     Stop playback and replace the internal playlist with the new one.

              <b>&lt;append&gt;</b>
                     Append the new playlist at the end of the current internal playlist.

              <b>&lt;append-play&gt;</b>
                     Append  the  new  playlist,  and  if  nothing is currently playing, start playback. (Always
                     starts with the new playlist, even if the internal playlist was not  empty  before  running
                     this command.)

              <b>&lt;insert-next&gt;</b>
                     Insert  the  new  playlist  into  the current internal playlist, directly after the current
                     entry.

              <b>&lt;insert-next-play&gt;</b>
                     Insert the new playlist, and if nothing  is  currently  playing,  start  playback.  (Always
                     starts  with  the  new playlist, even if the internal playlist was not empty before running
                     this command.)

              <b>&lt;insert-at&gt;</b>
                     Insert the new playlist at the index given in the third argument.

              <b>&lt;insert-at-play&gt;</b>
                     Insert the new playlist at the index given  in  the  third  argument,  and  if  nothing  is
                     currently  playing,  start  playback.  (Always  starts  with  the new playlist, even if the
                     internal playlist was not empty before running this command.)

              The third argument is an insertion index, used only by the <b>insert-at</b> and  <b>insert-at-play</b>  actions.
              When  used  with  those  actions,  the  new playlist will be inserted at the index position in the
              internal playlist, or appended to the end if index is less than 0 or greater than the size of  the
              internal playlist. This argument will be ignored for all other actions.

       <b>playlist-clear</b>
              Clear the playlist, except the currently played file.

       <b>playlist-remove</b> <b>&lt;index&gt;</b>
              Remove  the  playlist  entry  at  the given index. Index values start counting with 0. The special
              value <b>current</b> removes the current entry. Note that removing the current entry also stops  playback
              and starts playing the next entry.

       <b>playlist-move</b> <b>&lt;index1&gt;</b> <b>&lt;index2&gt;</b>
              Move the playlist entry at index1, so that it takes the place of the entry index2. (Paradoxically,
              the  moved  playlist  entry  will not have the index value index2 after moving if index1 was lower
              than index2, because index2 refers to the target entry, not the index the entry  will  have  after
              moving.)

       <b>playlist-shuffle</b>
              Shuffle the playlist. This is similar to what is done on start if the <b>--shuffle</b> option is used.

       <b>playlist-unshuffle</b>
              Attempt to revert the previous <b>playlist-shuffle</b> command. This works only once (multiple successive
              <b>playlist-unshuffle</b>  commands  do nothing).  May not work correctly if new recursive playlists have
              been opened since a <b>playlist-shuffle</b> command.

   <b>Track</b> <b>Manipulation</b>
       <b>sub-add</b> <b>&lt;url&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;flags&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;title&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;lang&gt;]]]</b>
              Load the given subtitle file or stream. By default, it is  selected  as  current  subtitle   after
              loading.

              The <b>flags</b> argument is one of the following values:

              &lt;select&gt;
                 Select the subtitle immediately (default).

              &lt;auto&gt;
                 Don't  select  the  subtitle.  (Or in some special situations, let the default stream selection
                 mechanism decide.)

              &lt;cached&gt;
                 Select the subtitle. If a subtitle with the same  filename  was  already  added,  that  one  is
                 selected, instead of loading a duplicate entry.  (In this case, title/language are ignored, and
                 if the was changed since it was loaded, these changes won't be reflected.)

              Additionally the following flags can be added with a <b>+</b>:

              &lt;hearing-impaired&gt;
                 Marks the track as suitable for the hearing impaired.

              &lt;visual-impaired&gt;
                 Marks the track as suitable for the visually impaired.

              &lt;attached-picture&gt; (only for <b>video-add</b>)
                 Marks the track as an attached picture, same as <b>albumart</b> argument for <b>`video-add</b>.

              The <b>title</b> argument sets the track title in the UI.

              The  <b>lang</b> argument sets the track language, and can also influence stream selection with <b>flags</b> set
              to <b>auto</b>.

       <b>sub-remove</b> <b>[&lt;id&gt;]</b>
              Remove the given subtitle track. If the <b>id</b> argument is missing, remove the current  track.  (Works
              on external subtitle files only.)

       <b>sub-reload</b> <b>[&lt;id&gt;]</b>
              Reload  the given subtitle tracks. If the <b>id</b> argument is missing, reload the current track. (Works
              on external subtitle files only.)

              This works by unloading and re-adding the subtitle track.

       <b>sub-step</b> <b>&lt;skip&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;flags&gt;]</b>
              Change subtitle timing such, that the subtitle event after the  next  <b>&lt;skip&gt;</b>  subtitle  events  is
              displayed. <b>&lt;skip&gt;</b> can be negative to step backwards.

              Secondary argument:

              <b>primary</b> <b>(default)</b>
                     Steps through the primary subtitles.

              <b>secondary</b>
                     Steps through the secondary subtitles.

       <b>audio-add</b> <b>&lt;url&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;flags&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;title&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;lang&gt;]]]</b>
              Load the given audio file. See <b>sub-add</b> command.

       <b>audio-remove</b> <b>[&lt;id&gt;]</b>
              Remove the given audio track. See <b>sub-remove</b> command.

       <b>audio-reload</b> <b>[&lt;id&gt;]</b>
              Reload the given audio tracks. See <b>sub-reload</b> command.

       <b>video-add</b> <b>&lt;url&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;flags&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;title&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;lang&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;albumart&gt;]]]]</b>
              Load the given video file. See <b>sub-add</b> command for common options.

              <b>albumart</b> <b>(MPV_FORMAT_FLAG)</b>
                     If enabled, mpv will load the given video as album art.

       <b>video-remove</b> <b>[&lt;id&gt;]</b>
              Remove the given video track. See <b>sub-remove</b> command.

       <b>video-reload</b> <b>[&lt;id&gt;]</b>
              Reload the given video tracks. See <b>sub-reload</b> command.

       <b>rescan-external-files</b> <b>[&lt;mode&gt;]</b>
              Rescan  external files according to the current <b>--sub-auto</b>, <b>--audio-file-auto</b> and <b>--cover-art-auto</b>
              settings. This can be used to auto-load external files <u>after</u> the file was loaded.

              The <b>mode</b> argument is one of the following:

              <b>&lt;reselect&gt;</b> <b>(default)</b>
                     Select the default audio and subtitle streams, which typically selects external files  with
                     the  highest  preference.  (The  implementation  is  not  perfect, and could be improved on
                     request.)

              <b>&lt;keep-selection&gt;</b>
                     Do not change current track selections.

   <b>Text</b> <b>Manipulation</b>
       <b>print-text</b> <b>&lt;text&gt;</b>
              Print text to stdout. The string can contain properties (see Property Expansion). Take care to put
              the argument in quotes.

       <b>expand-text</b> <b>&lt;text&gt;</b>
              Property-expand the argument and return the expanded string. This can be  used  only  through  the
              client API or from a script using <b>mp.command_native</b>. (see Property Expansion).

       <b>expand-path</b> <b>&lt;text&gt;</b>
              Expand a path's double-tilde placeholders into a platform-specific path.  As <b>expand-text</b>, this can
              only be used through the client API or from a script using <b>mp.command_native</b>.

                 Example

                        <b>mp.osd_message(mp.command_native({"expand-path",</b> <b>"~~home/"}))</b>

                        This  line  of  Lua would show the location of the user's mpv configuration directory on
                        the OSD.

       <b>normalize-path</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Return a canonical representation of the path <b>filename</b> by  converting  it  to  an  absolute  path,
              removing  consecutive  slashes,  removing  <b>.</b>   components, resolving <b>..</b> components, and converting
              slashes to backslashes on Windows. Symlinks are not resolved unless the platform is Unix-like  and
              one of the path components is <b>..</b>. If <b>filename</b> is a URL, it is returned unchanged. This can only be
              used through the client API or from a script using <b>mp.command_native</b>.

                 Example

                        <b>mp.osd_message(mp.command_native({"normalize-path",</b> <b>"/foo//./bar"}))</b>

                        This line of Lua prints "/foo/bar" on the OSD.

       <b>escape-ass</b> <b>&lt;text&gt;</b>
              Modify  <b>text</b>  so  that  commands  and  functions  that interpret ASS tags, such as <b>osd-overlay</b> and
              <b>mp.create_osd_overlay</b>, will display it verbatim, and return it. This can only be used through  the
              client API or from a script using <b>mp.command_native</b>.

                 Example

                        <b>mp.osd_message(mp.command_native({"escape-ass",</b> <b>"foo</b> <b>{bar}"}))</b>

                        This line of Lua prints "foo \{bar}" on the OSD.

   <b>Configuration</b> <b>Commands</b>
       <b>apply-profile</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;mode&gt;]</b>
              Apply  the  contents  of a named profile. This is like using <b>profile=name</b> in a config file, except
              you can map it to a key binding to change it at runtime.

              The mode argument:

              <b>apply</b>  Apply the profile. Default if the argument is omitted.

              <b>restore</b>
                     Restore options set by a previous <b>apply-profile</b> command for this profile. Only works if the
                     profile has <b>profile-restore</b> set to a relevant mode. Prints a warning if  nothing  could  be
                     done. See Runtime profiles for details.

       <b>load-config-file</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Load  a configuration file, similar to the <b>--include</b> option. If the file was already included, its
              previous options are not reset before it is reparsed.

       <b>write-watch-later-config</b>
              Write the resume config file that the  <b>quit-watch-later</b>  command  writes,  but  continue  playback
              normally.

       <b>delete-watch-later-config</b> <b>[&lt;filename&gt;]</b>
              Delete   any   existing   resume   config   file   that   was   written   by  <b>quit-watch-later</b>  or
              <b>write-watch-later-config</b>. If a filename is specified, then the deleted config is  for  that  file;
              otherwise,  it is the same one as would be written by <b>quit-watch-later</b> or <b>write-watch-later-config</b>
              in the current circumstance.

   <b>OSD</b> <b>Commands</b>
       <b>show-text</b> <b>&lt;text&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;duration&gt;|-1</b> <b>[&lt;level&gt;]]</b>
              Show text on the OSD. The string can contain  properties,  which  are  expanded  as  described  in
              Property  Expansion.  This  can  be used to show playback time, filename, and so on. <b>no-osd</b> has no
              effect on this command.

              <b>&lt;duration&gt;</b>
                     The time in  ms  to  show  the  message  for.  By  default,  it  uses  the  same  value  as
                     <b>--osd-duration</b>.

              <b>&lt;level&gt;</b>
                     The minimum OSD level to show the text at (see <b>--osd-level</b>).

       <b>show-progress</b>
              Show  the progress bar, the elapsed time and the total duration of the file on the OSD. <b>no-osd</b> has
              no effect on this command.

       <b>overlay-add</b> <b>&lt;id&gt;</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b> <b>&lt;y&gt;</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> <b>&lt;offset&gt;</b> <b>&lt;fmt&gt;</b> <b>&lt;w&gt;</b> <b>&lt;h&gt;</b> <b>&lt;stride&gt;</b> <b>&lt;dw&gt;</b> <b>&lt;dh&gt;</b>
              Add an OSD overlay sourced from raw data. This  might  be  useful  for  scripts  and  applications
              controlling mpv, and which want to display things on top of the video window.

              Overlays  are usually displayed in screen resolution, but with some VOs, the resolution is reduced
              to that of the video's. You can read the  <b>osd-width</b>  and  <b>osd-height</b>  properties.  At  least  with
              <b>--vo-xv</b> and anamorphic video (such as DVD), <b>osd-par</b> should be read as well, and the overlay should
              be aspect-compensated.

              This  has the following named arguments. The order of them is not guaranteed, so you should always
              call them with named arguments, see Named arguments.

              <b>id</b> is an integer between 0 and 63 identifying the overlay element. The  ID  can  be  used  to  add
              multiple  overlay  parts,  update  a part by using this command with an already existing ID, or to
              remove a part with <b>overlay-remove</b>. Using a previously unused ID will  add  a  new  overlay,  while
              reusing an ID will update it.

              <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> specify the position where the OSD should be displayed.

              <b>file</b>  specifies  the  file  the  raw image data is read from. It can be either a numeric UNIX file
              descriptor prefixed with <b>@</b> (e.g. <b>@4</b>), or a filename. The file will  be  mapped  into  memory  with
              <b>mmap()</b>, copied, and unmapped before the command returns (changed in mpv 0.18.1).

              It  is  also  possible  to  pass a raw memory address for use as bitmap memory by passing a memory
              address as integer prefixed with an <b>&amp;</b> character.  Passing the wrong  thing  here  will  crash  the
              player. This mode might be useful for use with libmpv. The <b>offset</b> parameter is simply added to the
              memory address (since mpv 0.8.0, ignored before).

              <b>offset</b>  is  the  byte  offset  of the first pixel in the source file.  (The current implementation
              always mmap's the whole file from position 0 to the end of the image, so large offsets  should  be
              avoided.  Before mpv 0.8.0, the offset was actually passed directly to <b>mmap</b>, but it was changed to
              make using it easier.)

              <b>fmt</b> is a string identifying the image format. Currently, only <b>bgra</b> is defined. This format  has  4
              bytes  per pixels, with 8 bits per component.  The least significant 8 bits are blue, and the most
              significant 8 bits are alpha (in little endian, the components are B-G-R-A, with B as first byte).
              This uses premultiplied alpha:  every  color  component  is  already  multiplied  with  the  alpha
              component.  This  means  the numeric value of each component is equal to or smaller than the alpha
              component. (Violating this rule will  lead  to  different  results  with  different  VOs:  numeric
              overflows  resulting  from  blending  broken  alpha  values is considered something that shouldn't
              happen, and consequently implementations don't ensure that you get predictable  behavior  in  this
              case.)

              <b>w</b>,  <b>h</b>,  and  <b>stride</b>  specify the size of the overlay. <b>w</b> is the visible width of the overlay, while
              <b>stride</b> gives the width in bytes in  memory.  In  the  simple  case,  and  with  the  <b>bgra</b>  format,
              <b>stride==4*w</b>.   In  general,  the total amount of memory accessed is <b>stride</b> <b>*</b> <b>h</b>.  (Technically, the
              minimum size would be <b>stride</b> <b>*</b> <b>(h</b> <b>-</b> <b>1)</b> <b>+</b> <b>w</b> <b>*</b> <b>4</b>, but for simplicity, the  player  will  access  all
              <b>stride</b> <b>*</b> <b>h</b> bytes.)

              <b>dw</b>  and <b>dh</b> specify the (optional) display size of the overlay.  The overlay visible portion of the
              overlay (<b>w</b> and <b>h</b>) is scaled to in display to <b>dw</b> and <b>dh</b>.  If parameters are not present, the values
              for <b>w</b> and <b>h</b> are used.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Before mpv 0.18.1, you had to  do  manual  "double  buffering"  when  updating  an  overlay  by
                 replacing  it with a different memory buffer. Since mpv 0.18.1, the memory is simply copied and
                 doesn't reference any of the memory indicated by the  command's  arguments  after  the  command
                 returns.   If  you want to use this command before mpv 0.18.1, reads the old docs to see how to
                 handle this correctly.

       <b>overlay-remove</b> <b>&lt;id&gt;</b>
              Remove an overlay added with <b>overlay-add</b> and the same ID. Does nothing if no overlay with this  ID
              exists.

       <b>osd-overlay</b>
              Add/update/remove an OSD overlay.

              (Although  this sounds similar to <b>overlay-add</b>, <b>osd-overlay</b> is for text overlays, while <b>overlay-add</b>
              is for bitmaps. Maybe <b>overlay-add</b> will be merged into <b>osd-overlay</b> to remove this oddity.)

              You can use this to add text overlays in ASS format. ASS has advanced  positioning  and  rendering
              tags, which can be used to render almost any kind of vector graphics.

              This command accepts the following parameters:

              <b>id</b>     Arbitrary  integer  that  identifies the overlay. Multiple overlays can be added by calling
                     this command with different <b>id</b> parameters. Calling this command with the same  <b>id</b>  replaces
                     the previously set overlay.

                     There  is a separate namespace for each libmpv client (i.e. IPC connection, script), so IDs
                     can be made up and assigned by the API user without conflicting with other API users.

                     If the libmpv client is destroyed, all overlays associated with it  are  also  deleted.  In
                     particular,  connecting  via  <b>--input-ipc-server</b>, adding an overlay, and disconnecting will
                     remove the overlay immediately again.

              <b>format</b> String that gives the type of the overlay. Accepts the following values (HTML rendering  of
                     this is broken, view the generated manpage instead, or the raw RST source):

                     <b>ass-events</b>
                            The  <b>data</b> parameter is a string. The string is split on the newline character. Every
                            line is turned into the <b>Text</b> part of a <b>Dialogue</b> ASS event.  Timing  is  unused  (but
                            behavior of timing dependent ASS tags may change in future mpv versions).

                            Note  that  it's  better to put multiple lines into <b>data</b>, instead of adding multiple
                            OSD overlays.

                            This provides 2 ASS <b>Styles</b>. <b>OSD</b> contains the text style as defined  by  the  current
                            <b>--osd-...</b> options. <b>Default</b> is similar, and contains style that <b>OSD</b> would have if all
                            options were set to the default.

                            In  addition,  the <b>res_x</b> and <b>res_y</b> options specify the value of the ASS <b>PlayResX</b> and
                            <b>PlayResY</b> header fields. If <b>res_y</b>  is  set  to  0,  <b>PlayResY</b>  is  initialized  to  an
                            arbitrary  default value (but note that the default for this command is 720, not 0).
                            If <b>res_x</b> is set to 0, <b>PlayResX</b> is set based on <b>res_y</b> such that a virtual  ASS  pixel
                            has a square pixel aspect ratio.

                     <b>none</b>   Special  value  that causes the overlay to be removed. Most parameters other than <b>id</b>
                            and <b>format</b> are mostly ignored.

              <b>data</b>   String defining the overlay contents according to the <b>format</b> parameter.

              <b>res_x,</b> <b>res_y</b>
                     Used if <b>format</b> is set to <b>ass-events</b> (see description there).  Optional, defaults to 0/720.

              <b>z</b>      The Z order of the overlay. Optional, defaults to 0.

                     Note that Z order between different overlays of different formats is static, and cannot  be
                     changed  (currently, this means that bitmap overlays added by <b>overlay-add</b> are always on top
                     of the ASS overlays added by <b>osd-overlay</b>). In addition,  the  builtin  OSD  components  are
                     always  below  any  of the custom OSD. (This includes subtitles of any kind as well as text
                     rendered by <b>show-text</b>.)

                     It's possible that future mpv versions will randomly change how Z order  between  different
                     OSD formats and builtin OSD is handled.

              <b>hidden</b> If set to true, do not display this (default: false).

              <b>compute_bounds</b>
                     If set to true, attempt to determine bounds and write them to the command's result value as
                     <b>x0</b>, <b>x1</b>, <b>y0</b>, <b>y1</b> rectangle (default: false). If the rectangle is empty, not known, or somehow
                     degenerate,  it  is  not set. <b>x1</b>/<b>y1</b> is the coordinate of the bottom exclusive corner of the
                     rectangle.

                     The result value may depend on the VO window size, and is based on the  last  known  window
                     size at the time of the call. This means the results may be different from what is actually
                     rendered.

                     For <b>ass-events</b>, the result rectangle is recomputed to <b>PlayRes</b> coordinates (<b>res_x</b>/<b>res_y</b>). If
                     window size is not known, a fallback is chosen.

                     You should be aware that this mechanism is very inefficient, as it renders the full result,
                     and then uses the bounding box of the rendered bitmap list (even if <b>hidden</b> is set). It will
                     flush various caches.  Its results also depend on the used libass version.

                     This feature is experimental, and may change in some way again.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Always    use    named   arguments   (<b>mpv_command_node()</b>).   Lua   scripts   should   use   the
                 <b>mp.create_osd_overlay()</b> helper instead of invoking this command directly.

   <b>Input</b> <b>and</b> <b>Keybind</b> <b>Commands</b>
       <b>mouse</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b> <b>&lt;y&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;button&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;mode&gt;]]</b>
              Send a mouse event with given coordinate (<b>&lt;x&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;y&gt;</b>).

              Second argument:

              <b>&lt;button&gt;</b>
                     The button number of clicked mouse button. This should be one  of  0-19.   If  <b>&lt;button&gt;</b>  is
                     omitted, only the position will be updated.

              Third argument:

              <b>&lt;single&gt;</b> <b>(default)</b>
                     The mouse event represents regular single click.

              <b>&lt;double&gt;</b>
                     The mouse event represents double-click.

       <b>keypress</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;scale&gt;]</b>
              Send  a  key event through mpv's input handler, triggering whatever behavior is configured to that
              key. <b>name</b> uses the <b>input.conf</b> naming scheme for  keys  and  modifiers.  <b>scale</b>  is  used  to  scale
              numerical  change effected by the bound command (same mechanism as precise scrolling).  Useful for
              the client API: key events can be sent to libmpv to handle internally.

       <b>keydown</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>
              Similar to <b>keypress</b>, but sets the <b>KEYDOWN</b> flag so that  if  the  key  is  bound  to  a  repeatable
              command, it will be run repeatedly with mpv's key repeat timing until the <b>keyup</b> command is called.

       <b>keyup</b> <b>[&lt;name&gt;]</b>
              Set  the  <b>KEYUP</b> flag, stopping any repeated behavior that had been triggered. <b>name</b> is optional. If
              <b>name</b> is not given or is an empty string, <b>KEYUP</b> will be set on all keys. Otherwise, <b>KEYUP</b> will only
              be set on the key specified by <b>name</b>.

       <b>keybind</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>&lt;cmd&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;comment&gt;]</b>
              Binds a key to an input command. <b>cmd</b> must  be  a  complete  command  containing  all  the  desired
              arguments  and  flags.  Both <b>name</b> and <b>cmd</b> use the <b>input.conf</b> naming scheme. <b>comment</b> is an optional
              string which can be read as the <b>comment</b> entry of <b>input-bindings</b>.  This is primarily useful for the
              client API.

       <b>enable-section</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;flags&gt;]</b>
              This command is deprecated, except for mpv-internal uses.

              Enable all key bindings in the named input section.

              The enabled input sections form a stack. Bindings  in  sections  on  the  top  of  the  stack  are
              preferred to lower sections. This command puts the section on top of the stack. If the section was
              already  on the stack, it is implicitly removed beforehand. (A section cannot be on the stack more
              than once.)

              The <b>flags</b> parameter can be a combination (separated by <b>+</b>) of the following flags:

              <b>&lt;exclusive&gt;</b>
                     All sections enabled  before  the  newly  enabled  section  are  disabled.   They  will  be
                     re-enabled  as  soon  as all exclusive sections above them are removed. In other words, the
                     new section shadows all previous sections.

              <b>&lt;allow-hide-cursor&gt;</b>
                     This feature can't be used through the public API.

              <b>&lt;allow-vo-dragging&gt;</b>
                     Same.

       <b>disable-section</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>
              This command is deprecated, except for mpv-internal uses.

              Disable the named input section. Undoes <b>enable-section</b>.

       <b>define-section</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>&lt;contents&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;flags&gt;]</b>
              This command is deprecated, except for mpv-internal uses.

              Create a named input section, or replace the contents of an already existing  input  section.  The
              <b>contents</b>  parameter  uses  the  same  syntax as the <b>input.conf</b> file (except that using the section
              syntax in it is not allowed), including the need to separate bindings with a newline character.

              If the <b>contents</b> parameter is an empty string, the section is removed.

              The section with the name <b>default</b> is the normal input section.

              In general, input sections have to be  enabled  with  the  <b>enable-section</b>  command,  or  they  are
              ignored.

              The last parameter has the following meaning:

              <b>&lt;default&gt;</b> <b>(also</b> <b>used</b> <b>if</b> <b>parameter</b> <b>omitted)</b>
                     Use a key binding defined by this section only if the user hasn't already bound this key to
                     a command.

              <b>&lt;force&gt;</b>
                     Always  bind a key. (The input section that was made active most recently wins if there are
                     ambiguities.)

              This command can be used to dispatch arbitrary keys to a script or a client API user. If the input
              section defines <b>script-binding</b> commands, it is  also  possible  to  get  separate  events  on  key
              up/down,  and  relatively  detailed information about the key state. The special key name <b>unmapped</b>
              can be used to match any unmapped key.

       <b>load-input-conf</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Load an input configuration file, similar to the <b>--input-conf</b> option.  If  the  file  was  already
              included, its previous bindings are not reset before it is reparsed.

   <b>Execution</b> <b>Commands</b>
       <b>run</b> <b>&lt;command&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;arg1&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;arg2&gt;</b> <b>[...]]]</b>
              Run  the  given command. Unlike in MPlayer/mplayer2 and earlier versions of mpv (0.2.x and older),
              this doesn't call the shell. Instead, the command is  run  directly,  with  each  argument  passed
              separately. Each argument is expanded like in Property Expansion.

              This command has a variable number of arguments, and cannot be used with named arguments.

              The  program  is  run  in  a  detached  way.  mpv doesn't wait until the command is completed, but
              continues playback right after spawning it.

              To get the old behavior, use <b><a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a></b> and <b>-c</b> as the first two arguments.

                 Example

                        <b>run</b> <b>"<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>"</b> <b>"-c"</b> <b>"echo</b> <b>${title}</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>/tmp/playing"</b>

                        This is not a particularly good example, because  it  doesn't  handle  escaping,  and  a
                        specially  prepared file might allow an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands. It
                        is recommended to write a small shell script, and call that with <b>run</b>.

       <b>subprocess</b>
              Similar to <b>run</b>, but gives more control about process execution to the caller, and does not  detach
              the process.

              You  can  avoid blocking until the process terminates by running this command asynchronously. (For
              example <b>mp.command_native_async()</b> in Lua scripting.)

              This has the following named arguments. The order of them is not guaranteed, so you should  always
              call them with named arguments, see Named arguments.

              <b>args</b> <b>(MPV_FORMAT_NODE_ARRAY[MPV_FORMAT_STRING])</b>
                     Array  of strings with the command as first argument, and subsequent command line arguments
                     following. This is just like the <b>run</b> command argument list.

                     The first array entry is either an absolute path to the executable, or a filename  with  no
                     path  components,  in  which case the executable is searched in the directories in the <b>PATH</b>
                     environment variable. On Unix, this is equivalent to <b>posix_spawnp</b> and <b>execvp</b> behavior.

              <b>playback_only</b> <b>(MPV_FORMAT_FLAG)</b>
                     Boolean indicating whether the process should  be  killed  when  playback  of  the  current
                     playlist  entry  terminates  (optional,  default: true). If enabled, stopping playback will
                     automatically kill the process, and you can't start it outside of playback.

              <b>capture_size</b> <b>(MPV_FORMAT_INT64)</b>
                     Integer setting the maximum number of  stdout  plus  stderr  bytes  that  can  be  captured
                     (optional,  default:  64MB). If the number of bytes exceeds this, capturing is stopped. The
                     limit is per captured stream.

              <b>capture_stdout</b> <b>(MPV_FORMAT_FLAG)</b>
                     Capture all data the process outputs  to  stdout  and  return  it  once  the  process  ends
                     (optional, default: no).

              <b>capture_stderr</b> <b>(MPV_FORMAT_FLAG)</b>
                     Same as <b>capture_stdout</b>, but for stderr.

              <b>detach</b> <b>(MPV_FORMAT_FLAG)</b>
                     Whether  to  run  the  process  in detached mode (optional, default: no). In this mode, the
                     process is run in a new process session, and the command does not wait for the  process  to
                     terminate.  If neither <b>capture_stdout</b> nor <b>capture_stderr</b> have been set to true, the command
                     returns immediately after the new process has been started, otherwise the command will read
                     as long as the pipes are open.

              <b>env</b> <b>(MPV_FORMAT_NODE_ARRAY[MPV_FORMAT_STRING])</b>
                     Set a list of environment variables for the new process (default: empty).  If an empty list
                     is passed, the environment of the mpv process is used instead. (Unlike  the  underlying  OS
                     mechanisms,  the  mpv  command  cannot start a process with empty environment. Fortunately,
                     that is completely useless.) The format of the list is as in  the  <b>execle()</b>  syscall.  Each
                     string item defines an environment variable as in <b>NAME=VALUE</b>.

                     On  Lua,  you  may use <b>utils.get_env_list()</b> to retrieve the current environment if you e.g.
                     simply want to add a new variable.

              <b>stdin_data</b> <b>(MPV_FORMAT_STRING)</b>
                     Feed the given string to the new process' stdin. Since this is a string,  you  cannot  pass
                     arbitrary  binary  data.  If  the  process terminates or closes the pipe before all data is
                     written, the remaining data is silently discarded. Probably does not work on win32.

              <b>passthrough_stdin</b> <b>(MPV_FORMAT_FLAG)</b>
                     If enabled, wire the new process' stdin to mpv's stdin (default: no).  Before  mpv  0.33.0,
                     this argument did not exist, but the behavior was as if this was set to true.

              The command returns the following result (as <b>MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP</b>):

              <b>status</b> <b>(MPV_FORMAT_INT64)</b>
                     Typically this is the process exit code (0 or positive) if the process terminates normally,
                     or negative for other errors (failed to start, terminated by mpv, and others).  The meaning
                     of  negative  values  is undefined, other than meaning error (and does not correspond to OS
                     low level exit status values).

                     On Windows, it can happen that a negative return value is  returned  even  if  the  process
                     terminates normally, because the win32 <b>UINT</b> exit code is assigned to an <b>int</b> variable before
                     being set as <b>int64_t</b> field in the result map. This might be fixed later.

              <b>stdout</b> <b>(MPV_FORMAT_BYTE_ARRAY)</b>
                     Captured stdout stream, limited to <b>capture_size</b>.

              <b>stderr</b> <b>(MPV_FORMAT_BYTE_ARRAY)</b>
                     Same as <b>stdout</b>, but for stderr.

              <b>error_string</b> <b>(MPV_FORMAT_STRING)</b>
                     Empty  string  if  the  process  terminated  normally. The string <b>killed</b> if the process was
                     terminated in an unusual way. The string <b>init</b> if the process could not be started.

                     On Windows, <b>killed</b> is only returned when the process has been killed by mpv as a result  of
                     <b>playback_only</b> being set to true.

              <b>killed_by_us</b> <b>(MPV_FORMAT_FLAG)</b>
                     Whether  the process has been killed by mpv, for example as a result of <b>playback_only</b> being
                     set to true, aborting the command (e.g. by <b>mp.abort_async_command()</b>), or if the  player  is
                     about to exit.

              Note  that  the  command  itself will always return success as long as the parameters are correct.
              Whether the process could be spawned or whether it was somehow killed or returned an error  status
              has to be queried from the result value.

              This  command  can  be asynchronously aborted via API. Also see Asynchronous command details. Only
              the <b>run</b> command can start processes in a truly detached way.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 The subprocess will always be terminated on player exit if it wasn't started in detached  mode,
                 even if <b>playback_only</b> is false.

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 Don't  forget  to set the <b>playback_only</b> field to false if you want the command to run while the
                 player is in idle mode, or if you don't want the end of playback to kill the command.

                 Example

                     local r = mp.command_native({
                         name = "subprocess",
                         playback_only = false,
                         capture_stdout = true,
                         args = {"cat", "<a href="file:/proc/cpuinfo">/proc/cpuinfo</a>"},
                     })
                     if r.status == 0 then
                         print("result: " .. r.stdout)
                     end

                 This is a fairly useless Lua example, which demonstrates how to run a  process  in  a  blocking
                 manner, and retrieving its stdout output.

       <b>quit</b> <b>[&lt;code&gt;]</b>
              Exit the player. If an argument is given, it's used as process exit code.

       <b>quit-watch-later</b> <b>[&lt;code&gt;]</b>
              Exit  player,  and  store  current  playback  position.  Playing  that file later will seek to the
              previous position on start. The (optional) argument  is  exactly  as  in  the  <b>quit</b>  command.  See
              RESUMING PLAYBACK.

   <b>Scripting</b> <b>Commands</b>
       <b>script-message</b> <b>[&lt;arg1&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;arg2&gt;</b> <b>[...]]]</b>
              Send  a  message  to  all clients, and pass it the following list of arguments.  What this message
              means, how many arguments it takes, and what the arguments mean is fully up to  the  receiver  and
              the  sender.  Every  client  receives  the  message,  so  be  careful  about  name clashes (or use
              <b>script-message-to</b>).

              This command has a variable number of arguments, and cannot be used with named arguments.

       <b>script-message-to</b> <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;arg1&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;arg2&gt;</b> <b>[...]]]</b>
              Same as <b>script-message</b>, but send it only to the client named <b>&lt;target&gt;</b>. Each client (scripts  etc.)
              has a unique name. For example, Lua scripts can get their name via <b>mp.get_script_name()</b>. Note that
              client names only consist of alphanumeric characters and <b>_</b>.

              This command has a variable number of arguments, and cannot be used with named arguments.

       <b>script-binding</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;arg&gt;]</b>
              Invoke  a script-provided key binding. This can be used to remap key bindings provided by external
              Lua scripts.

              <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> is the name of the binding. <b>&lt;arg&gt;</b> is a user-provided arbitrary string which can be used  to
              provide extra information.

              It  can  optionally  be  prefixed  with  the  name  of  the  script,  using  <b>/</b>  as separator, e.g.
              <b>script-binding</b> <b>scriptname/bindingname</b>.  Note  that  script  names  only  consist  of  alphanumeric
              characters and <b>_</b>.

              For completeness, here is how this command works internally. The details could change any time. On
              any  matching  key  event, <b>script-message-to</b> or <b>script-message</b> is called (depending on whether the
              script name is included), with the following arguments in string format:

              1. The string <b>key-binding</b>.

              2. The name of the binding (as established above).

              3. The key state as string (see below).

              4. The key name (since mpv 0.15.0).

              5. The text the key would produce, or empty string if not applicable.

              6. The scale of the key, such as the ones produced by <b>WHEEL_*</b> keys.  The scale is 1 if the key  is
                 nonscalable.

              7. The user-provided string <b>&lt;arg&gt;</b>, or empty string if the argument is not used.

              The  5th  argument  is  only set if no modifiers are present (using the shift key with a letter is
              normally not emitted as having a modifier, and results  in  upper  case  text  instead,  but  some
              backends may mess up).

              The key state consists of 3 characters:

              1. One of <b>d</b> (key was pressed down), <b>u</b> (was released), <b>r</b> (key is still down, and was repeated; only
                 if  key  repeat  is  enabled for this binding), <b>p</b> (key was pressed; happens if up/down can't be
                 tracked).

              2. Whether the event originates from the mouse, either <b>m</b> (mouse button) or <b>-</b> (something else).

              3. Whether the event results from a cancellation (e.g. the  key  is  logically  released  but  not
                 physically released), either <b>c</b> (canceled) or <b>-</b> (something else). Not all types of cancellations
                 set this flag.

              Future  versions  can  add  more  arguments  and  more  key state characters to support more input
              peculiarities.

              This is a scalable command. See the documentation of <b>nonscalable</b> input  command  prefix  in  Input
              Command Prefixes for details.

       <b>load-script</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Load  a  script,  similar  to  the  <b>--script</b>  option.  Whether this waits for the script to finish
              initialization or not changed multiple times, and the future behavior is left undefined.

              On success,  returns  a  <b>mpv_node</b>  with  a  <b>client_id</b>  field  set  to  the  return  value  of  the
              <b>mpv_client_id()</b> API call of the newly created script handle.

   <b>Screenshot</b> <b>Commands</b>
       <b>screenshot</b> <b>[&lt;flags&gt;]</b>
              Take a screenshot.

              Multiple flags are available (some can be combined with <b>+</b>):

              <b>&lt;subtitles&gt;</b> <b>(default)</b>
                     Save  the  video image, in its original resolution, and with subtitles.  Some video outputs
                     may still include the OSD in the output under certain circumstances.

              <b>&lt;video&gt;</b>
                     Like <b>subtitles</b>, but typically without OSD or subtitles. The exact behavior depends  on  the
                     selected video output.

              <b>&lt;window&gt;</b>
                     Save  the  contents  of the mpv window. Typically scaled, with OSD and subtitles. The exact
                     behavior depends on the selected video output.

              <b>&lt;each-frame&gt;</b>
                     Take a screenshot each frame. Issue this command again to  stop  taking  screenshots.  Note
                     that  you  should  disable  frame-dropping  when  using  this  mode  - or you might receive
                     duplicate images in cases when a frame was dropped. This flag  can  be  combined  with  the
                     other flags, e.g. <b>video+each-frame</b>.

              Older  mpv  versions  required  passing <b>single</b> and <b>each-frame</b> as second argument (and did not have
              flags). This syntax is still understood, but deprecated and might be removed in the future.

              If you combine this command with another one  using  <b>;</b>,  you  can  use  the  <b>async</b>  flag  to  make
              encoding/writing  the  image  file  asynchronous.  For  normal standalone commands, this is always
              asynchronous, and the flag has no effect. (This behavior changed with mpv 0.29.0.)

              On success, returns a <b>mpv_node</b> with a <b>filename</b> field set to the saved screenshot location.

       <b>screenshot-to-file</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;flags&gt;]</b>
              Take a screenshot and save it to a given file. The format of the  file  will  be  guessed  by  the
              extension  (and  <b>--screenshot-format</b>  is  ignored  - the behavior when the extension is missing or
              unknown is arbitrary).

              The second argument is like the first  argument  to  <b>screenshot</b>  and  supports  <b>subtitles</b>,  <b>video</b>,
              <b>window</b>.

              If the file already exists, it's overwritten.

              Like  all  input command parameters, the filename is subject to property expansion as described in
              Property Expansion.

       <b>screenshot-raw</b> <b>[&lt;flags&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;format&gt;]]</b>
              Return  a  screenshot  in  memory.  This  can  be  used  only  through   the   client   API.   The
              MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP returned by this command has the <b>w</b>, <b>h</b>, <b>stride</b> fields set to obvious contents.

              The <b>format</b> field is set to the format of the screenshot image data.  This can be controlled by the
              <b>format</b> argument. The format can be one of the following:

              <b>bgr0</b> <b>(default)</b>
                     This  format  is organized as <b>B8G8R8X8</b> (where <b>B</b> is the LSB).  The contents of the padding <b>X</b>
                     are undefined.

              <b>bgra</b>   This format is organized as <b>B8G8R8A8</b> (where <b>B</b> is the LSB).

              <b>rgba</b>   This format is organized as <b>R8G8B8A8</b> (where <b>R</b> is the LSB).

              <b>rgba64</b> This format is organized as <b>R16G16B16A16</b> (where <b>R</b> is the LSB).  Each component  occupies  2
                     bytes  per  pixel.   When  this  format is used, the image data will be high bit depth, and
                     <b>--screenshot-high-bit-depth</b> is ignored.

              The <b>data</b> field is of type MPV_FORMAT_BYTE_ARRAY with the actual image data. The image is freed  as
              soon  as  the result mpv_node is freed. As usual with client API semantics, you are not allowed to
              write to the image data.

              The <b>stride</b> is the number of bytes from a pixel at <b>(x0,</b> <b>y0)</b> to the pixel at <b>(x0,</b> <b>y0</b> <b>+</b> <b>1)</b>. This  can
              be  larger  than  <b>w</b>  <b>*</b>  <b>bpp</b>  if  the image was cropped, or if there is padding. This number can be
              negative as well.  You access a pixel with <b>byte_index</b> <b>=</b> <b>y</b> <b>*</b> <b>stride</b> <b>+</b> <b>x</b> <b>*</b> <b>bpp</b>.  Here,  <b>bpp</b>  is  the
              number of bytes per pixel, which is 8 for <b>rgba64</b> format and 4 for other formats.

              The <b>flags</b> argument is like the first argument to <b>screenshot</b> and supports <b>subtitles</b>, <b>video</b>, <b>window</b>.

   <b>Filter</b> <b>Commands</b>
       <b>af</b> <b>&lt;operation&gt;</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Change audio filter chain. See <b>vf</b> command.

       <b>vf</b> <b>&lt;operation&gt;</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Change video filter chain.

              The  semantics  are  exactly the same as with option parsing (see VIDEO FILTERS). As such the text
              below is a redundant and incomplete summary.

              The first argument decides what happens:

              <b>&lt;set&gt;</b>  Overwrite the previous filter chain with the new one.

              <b>&lt;add&gt;</b>  Append the new filter chain to the previous one.

              <b>&lt;toggle&gt;</b>
                     Check if the given filter (with the exact parameters) is already in the video chain. If  it
                     is,  remove the filter. If it isn't, add the filter.  (If several filters are passed to the
                     command, this is done for each filter.)

                     A special variant is combining this with labels, and using <b>@name</b> without  filter  name  and
                     parameters as filter entry. This toggles the enable/disable flag.

              <b>&lt;remove&gt;</b>
                     Like <b>toggle</b>, but always remove the given filter from the chain.

              <b>&lt;clr&gt;</b>  Remove  all  filters.  Note  that  like  the  other  sub-commands,  this  does  not control
                     automatically inserted filters.

              The argument is always needed. E.g. in case of <b>clr</b> use <b>vf</b> <b>clr</b> <b>""</b>.

              You can assign labels to filter by prefixing  them  with  <b>@name:</b>  (where  <b>name</b>  is  a  user-chosen
              arbitrary  identifier).  Labels can be used to refer to filters by name in all of the filter chain
              modification commands.  For <b>add</b>, using an already used label will replace the existing filter.

              The <b>vf</b> command shows the list of requested filters on the OSD after  changing  the  filter  chain.
              This  is  roughly  equivalent  to  <b>show-text</b>  <b>${vf}</b>.  Note  that  auto-inserted filters for format
              conversion are not shown on the list, only what was requested by the user.

              Normally, the commands will check whether the video chain is recreated successfully, and will undo
              the operation on failure. If the command is run before video is  configured  (can  happen  if  the
              command  is  run immediately after opening a file and before a video frame is decoded), this check
              can't be run. Then it can happen that creating the video chain fails.

                 Example for input.conf

                 • <b>a</b> <b>vf</b> <b>set</b> <b>vflip</b> turn the video upside-down on the <b>a</b> key

                 • <b>b</b> <b>vf</b> <b>set</b> <b>""</b> remove all video filters on <b>b</b>

                 • <b>c</b> <b>vf</b> <b>toggle</b> <b>gradfun</b> toggle debanding on <b>c</b>

                 Example how to toggle disabled filters at runtime

                 • Add something like <b>vf-add=@deband:!gradfun</b> to  <b>mpv.conf</b>.   The  <b>@deband:</b>  is  the  label,  an
                   arbitrary,  user-given  name for this filter entry. The <b>!</b> before the filter name disables the
                   filter by default. Everything after this is  the  normal  filter  name  and  possibly  filter
                   parameters, like in the normal <b>--vf</b> syntax.

                 • Add  <b>a</b>  <b>vf</b> <b>toggle</b> <b>@deband</b> to <b>input.conf</b>. This toggles the "disabled" flag for the filter with
                   the label <b>deband</b> when the <b>a</b> key is hit.

       <b>vf-command</b> <b>&lt;label&gt;</b> <b>&lt;command&gt;</b> <b>&lt;argument&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;target&gt;]</b>
              Send a command to the filter. Note that currently, this only works with the <b>lavfi</b> filter. Refer to
              the libavfilter documentation for the list of supported commands for each filter.

              <b>&lt;label&gt;</b> is a mpv filter label, use <b>all</b> to send it to all filters at once.

              <b>&lt;command&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;argument&gt;</b> are filter-specific strings.

              <b>&lt;target&gt;</b> is a filter or filter instance name and defaults to <b>all</b>.  Note  that  the  target  is  an
              additional specifier for filters that support them, such as complex <b>lavfi</b> filter chains.

       <b>af-command</b> <b>&lt;label&gt;</b> <b>&lt;command&gt;</b> <b>&lt;argument&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;target&gt;]</b>
              Same as <b>vf-command</b>, but for audio filters.

   <b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>Commands</b>
       <b>ignore</b> Use  this  to  "block"  keys  that should be unbound, and do nothing. Useful for disabling default
              bindings, without disabling all bindings with <b>--input-default-bindings=no</b>.

       <b>drop-buffers</b>
              Drop audio/video/demuxer buffers, and restart from fresh. Might help with unseekable streams  that
              are going out of sync.  This command might be changed or removed in the future.

       <b>dump-cache</b> <b>&lt;start&gt;</b> <b>&lt;end&gt;</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Dump  the  current  cache  to the given filename. The <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> file is overwritten if it already
              exists. <b>&lt;start&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;end&gt;</b> give the time range of what to dump. If no data is cached at  the  given
              time range, nothing may be dumped (creating a file with no packets).

              Dumping a larger part of the cache will freeze the player. No effort was made to fix this, as this
              feature was meant mostly for creating small excerpts.

              See  <b>--stream-record</b>  for  various  caveats that mostly apply to this command too, as both use the
              same underlying code for writing the output file.

              If <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> is an empty string, an ongoing <b>dump-cache</b> is stopped.

              If <b>&lt;end&gt;</b> is <b>no</b>, then continuous dumping is enabled. Then, after dumping the existing parts of  the
              cache,  anything  read  from  network  is  appended  to the cache as well. This behaves similar to
              <b>--stream-record</b> (although it does not conflict with that option, and they can be  both  active  at
              the same time).

              If the <b>&lt;end&gt;</b> time is after the cache, the command will _not_ wait and write newly received data to
              it.

              The end of the resulting file may be slightly damaged or incomplete at the end. (Not enough effort
              was made to ensure that the end lines up properly.)

              Note  that  this  command  will  finish only once dumping ends. That means it works similar to the
              <b>screenshot</b> command, just that it can block much longer. If continuous dumping is used, the command
              will not finish until playback is stopped, an error happens, another <b>dump-cache</b> command is run, or
              an API like <b>mp.abort_async_command</b> was called to explicitly stop the command. See Synchronous  vs.
              Asynchronous.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This  was mostly created for network streams. For local files, there may be much better methods
                 to create excerpts and such. There are tons of much more user-friendly Lua scripts,  that  will
                 re-encode parts of a file by spawning a separate instance of <b>ffmpeg</b>. With network streams, this
                 is  not  that  easily  possible,  as  the  stream  would  have  to be downloaded again. Even if
                 <b>--stream-record</b> is used to record the stream to the local filesystem, there  may  be  problems,
                 because the recorded file is still written to.

              This command is experimental, and all details about it may change in the future.

       <b>ab-loop</b>
              Cycle  through  A-B  loop states. The first command will set the <b>A</b> point (the <b>ab-loop-a</b> property);
              the second the <b>B</b> point, and the third will clear both points.

       <b>ab-loop-dump-cache</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Essentially calls <b>dump-cache</b> with the current AB-loop points as arguments. Like  <b>dump-cache</b>,  this
              will  overwrite  the  file  at  <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>.  Likewise,  if the B point is set to <b>no</b>, it will enter
              continuous dumping after the existing cache was dumped.

              The author reserves the right to remove this command if enough motivation is found  to  move  this
              functionality to a trivial Lua script.

       <b>ab-loop-align-cache</b>
              Re-adjust the A/B loop points to the start and end within the cache the <b>ab-loop-dump-cache</b> command
              will  (probably)  dump.  Basically,  it  aligns  the  times  on  keyframes. The guess might be off
              especially at the end (due to granularity issues due to remuxing). If the  cache  shrinks  in  the
              meantime, the points set by the command will not be the effective parameters either.

              This command has an even more uncertain future than <b>ab-loop-dump-cache</b> and might disappear without
              replacement if the author decides it's useless.

       <b>begin-vo-dragging</b>
              Begin  window  dragging if supported by the current VO. This command should only be called while a
              mouse button is being pressed, otherwise it will be ignored. The  exact  effect  of  this  command
              depends  on  the  VO implementation of window dragging. For example, on Windows and macOS only the
              left mouse button can begin window dragging, while X11 and Wayland allow other mouse buttons.

       <b>context-menu</b>
              Show context menu on the video window. See Context Menu section for details.

       Undocumented commands: <b>ao-reload</b> (experimental/internal).

   <b>List</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b>
       This is a partial list of events. This section describes what <b>mpv_event_to_node()</b> returns, and  which  is
       what  scripting  APIs  and  the JSON IPC sees. Note that the C API has separate C-level declarations with
       <b>mpv_event</b>, which may be slightly different.

       Note that events are asynchronous: the player core  continues  running  while  events  are  delivered  to
       scripts and other clients. In some cases, you can use hooks to enforce synchronous execution.

       All events can have the following fields:

       <b>event</b>  Name as the event (as returned by <b>mpv_event_name()</b>).

       <b>id</b>     The <b>reply_userdata</b> field (opaque user value). If <b>reply_userdata</b> is 0, the field is not added.

       <b>error</b>  Set  to  an  error  string  (as returned by <b>mpv_error_string()</b>). This field is missing if no error
              happened, or the event type does not report error.  Most events leave this unset.

       This list uses the event name field value, and the C API symbol in brackets:

       <b>start-file</b> <b>(MPV_EVENT_START_FILE)</b>
              Happens right before a new file is loaded. When you receive this, the player is loading  the  file
              (or possibly already done with it).

              This has the following fields:

              <b>playlist_entry_id</b>
                     Playlist entry ID of the file being loaded now.

       <b>end-file</b> <b>(MPV_EVENT_END_FILE)</b>
              Happens  after  a  file was unloaded. Typically, the player will load the next file right away, or
              quit if this was the last file.

              The event has the following fields:

              <b>reason</b> Has one of these values:

                     <b>eof</b>    The file has ended. This can (but doesn't  have  to)  include  incomplete  files  or
                            broken network connections under circumstances.

                     <b>stop</b>   Playback was ended by a command.

                     <b>quit</b>   Playback was ended by sending the quit command.

                     <b>error</b>  An error happened. In this case, an <b>error</b> field is present with the error string.

                     <b>redirect</b>
                            Happens  with playlists and similar. Details see <b>MPV_END_FILE_REASON_REDIRECT</b> in the
                            C API.

                     <b>unknown</b>
                            Unknown. Normally doesn't happen, unless the Lua API is out of sync with the C  API.
                            (Likewise,  it  could happen that your script gets reason strings that did not exist
                            yet at the time your script was written.)

              <b>playlist_entry_id</b>
                     Playlist entry ID of the file that was being played or attempted to be played. This has the
                     same value as the <b>playlist_entry_id</b> field in the corresponding <b>start-file</b> event.

              <b>file_error</b>
                     Set to mpv error string describing the approximate reason why playback failed. Unset if  no
                     error  known.  (In  Lua  scripting, this value was set on the <b>error</b> field directly. This is
                     deprecated since mpv 0.33.0.  In the future, this  <b>error</b>  field  will  be  unset  for  this
                     specific event.)

              <b>playlist_insert_id</b>
                     If  loading  ended, because the playlist entry to be played was for example a playlist, and
                     the current playlist entry is replaced with a number of other entries. This may  happen  at
                     least  with  MPV_END_FILE_REASON_REDIRECT  (other  event types may use this for similar but
                     different purposes in the future). In this case, playlist_insert_id  will  be  set  to  the
                     playlist entry ID of the first inserted entry, and playlist_insert_num_entries to the total
                     number  of  inserted  playlist entries. Note this in this specific case, the ID of the last
                     inserted entry is playlist_insert_id+num-1.  Beware that depending  on  circumstances,  you
                     may  observe  the new playlist entries before seeing the event (e.g. reading the "playlist"
                     property or getting a property change notification before receiving the event).  If this is
                     0 in the C API, this field isn't added.

              <b>playlist_insert_num_entries</b>
                     See playlist_insert_id. Only present if playlist_insert_id is present.

       <b>file-loaded</b> <b>(MPV_EVENT_FILE_LOADED)</b>
              Happens after a file was loaded and begins playback.

       <b>seek</b> <b>(MPV_EVENT_SEEK)</b>
              Happens on seeking. (This might include cases when the player seeks internally, even without  user
              interaction. This includes e.g. segment changes when playing ordered chapters Matroska files.)

       <b>playback-restart</b> <b>(MPV_EVENT_PLAYBACK_RESTART)</b>
              Start of playback after seek or after file was loaded.

       <b>shutdown</b> <b>(MPV_EVENT_SHUTDOWN)</b>
              Sent  when  the player quits, and the script should terminate. Normally handled automatically. See
              Details on the script initialization and lifecycle.

       <b>log-message</b> <b>(MPV_EVENT_LOG_MESSAGE)</b>
              Receives messages enabled with <b>mpv_request_log_messages()</b> (Lua: <b>mp.enable_messages</b>).

              This contains, in addition to the default event fields, the following fields:

              <b>prefix</b> The module prefix, identifies the sender of the message. This is what the  terminal  player
                     puts  in  front of the message text when using the <b>--v</b> option, and is also what is used for
                     <b>--msg-level</b>.

              <b>level</b>  The log level as string. See <b>msg.log</b>  for  possible  log  level  names.   Note  that  later
                     versions of mpv might add new levels or remove (undocumented) existing ones.

              <b>text</b>   The  log  message.  The  text  will  end with a newline character. Sometimes it can contain
                     multiple lines.

              Keep in mind that these messages are meant to be hints for humans. You should not parse them,  and
              prefix/level/text of messages might change any time.

       <b>hook</b>   The event has the following fields:

              <b>hook_id</b>
                     ID  to  pass to <b>mpv_hook_continue()</b>. The Lua scripting wrapper provides a better API around
                     this with <b>mp.add_hook()</b>.

       <b>get-property-reply</b> <b>(MPV_EVENT_GET_PROPERTY_REPLY)</b>
              See C API.

       <b>set-property-reply</b> <b>(MPV_EVENT_SET_PROPERTY_REPLY)</b>
              See C API.

       <b>command-reply</b> <b>(MPV_EVENT_COMMAND_REPLY)</b>
              This is one of the commands for which the <b>`error</b> field is meaningful.

              JSON IPC and Lua and possibly other backends treat this specially and  may  not  pass  the  actual
              event to the user. See C API.

              The event has the following fields:

              <b>result</b> The result (on success) of any <b>mpv_node</b> type, if any.

       <b>client-message</b> <b>(MPV_EVENT_CLIENT_MESSAGE)</b>
              Lua  and  possibly  other  backends  treat this specially and may not pass the actual event to the
              user.

              The event has the following fields:

              <b>args</b>   Array of strings with the message data.

       <b>video-reconfig</b> <b>(MPV_EVENT_VIDEO_RECONFIG)</b>
              Happens on video output or filter reconfig.

       <b>audio-reconfig</b> <b>(MPV_EVENT_AUDIO_RECONFIG)</b>
              Happens on audio output or filter reconfig.

       <b>property-change</b> <b>(MPV_EVENT_PROPERTY_CHANGE)</b>
              Happens when a property that is being observed changes value.

              The event has the following fields:

              <b>name</b>   The name of the property.

              <b>data</b>   The new value of the property.

       The following events also happen,  but  are  deprecated:  <b>idle</b>,  <b>tick</b>  Use  <b>mpv_observe_property()</b>  (Lua:
       <b>mp.observe_property()</b>) instead.

   <b>Hooks</b>
       Hooks  are  synchronous  events  between  player core and a script or similar. This applies to client API
       (including the Lua scripting interface). Normally, events are supposed to be asynchronous, and  the  hook
       API provides an awkward and obscure way to handle events that require stricter coordination. There are no
       API  stability  guarantees  made. Not following the protocol exactly can make the player freeze randomly.
       Basically, nobody should use this API.

       The C API is described in the header files. The Lua API is described in the Lua section.

       Before a hook is actually invoked on an API clients, it  will  attempt  to  return  new  values  for  all
       observed  properties that were changed before the hook. This may make it easier for an application to set
       defined "barriers" between property change notifications by registering hooks. (That  means  these  hooks
       will have an effect, even if you do nothing and make them continue immediately.)

       The following hooks are currently defined:

       <b>on_load</b>
              Called when a file is to be opened, before anything is actually done.  For example, you could read
              and write the <b>stream-open-filename</b> property to redirect an URL to something else (consider support
              for  streaming  sites  which  rarely  give the user a direct media URL), or you could set per-file
              options with by setting the property <b>file-local-options/&lt;option</b> <b>name&gt;</b>. The player will wait  until
              all hooks are run.

              Ordered after <b>start-file</b> and before <b>playback-restart</b>.

       <b>on_load_fail</b>
              Called  after  after a file has been opened, but failed to. This can be used to provide a fallback
              in case native demuxers failed to recognize the file, instead of always running before the  native
              demuxers like <b>on_load</b>. Demux will only be retried if <b>stream-open-filename</b> was changed. If it fails
              again, this hook is _not_ called again, and loading definitely fails.

              Ordered after <b>on_load</b>, and before <b>playback-restart</b> and <b>end-file</b>.

       <b>on_preloaded</b>
              Called after a file has been opened, and before tracks are selected and decoders are created. This
              has some usefulness if an API users wants to select tracks manually, based on the set of available
              tracks. It's also useful to initialize <b>--lavfi-complex</b> in a specific way by API, without having to
              "probe" the available streams at first.

              Note  that  this  does not yet apply default track selection. Which operations exactly can be done
              and not be done, and what information is available and what is  not  yet  available  yet,  is  all
              subject to change.

              Ordered after <b>on_load_fail</b> etc. and before <b>playback-restart</b>.

       <b>on_unload</b>
              Run  before  closing  a  file, and before actually uninitializing everything. It's not possible to
              resume playback in this state.

              Ordered before <b>end-file</b>. Will also happen in the error case (then after <b>on_load_fail</b>).

       <b>on_before_start_file</b>
              Run before a <b>start-file</b> event is sent. (If any client changes the current playlist entry, or sends
              a quit command to the player, the corresponding event will not  actually  happen  after  the  hook
              returns.)  Useful to drain property changes before a new file is loaded.

       <b>on_after_end_file</b>
              Run after an <b>end-file</b> event. Useful to drain property changes after a file has finished.

   <b>Input</b> <b>Command</b> <b>Prefixes</b>
       These  prefixes  are  placed between key name and the actual command. Multiple prefixes can be specified.
       They are separated by whitespace.

       <b>osd-auto</b>
              Use the default behavior for this command. This is  the  default  for  <b>input.conf</b>  commands.  Some
              libmpv/scripting/IPC APIs do not use this as default, but use <b>no-osd</b> instead.

       <b>no-osd</b> Do not use any OSD for this command.

       <b>osd-bar</b>
              If  possible,  show  a  bar  with this command. Seek commands will show the progress bar, property
              changing commands may show the newly set value.

       <b>osd-msg</b>
              If possible, show an OSD message with this command. Seek command show the current  playback  time,
              property changing commands show the newly set value as text.

       <b>osd-msg-bar</b>
              Combine osd-bar and osd-msg.

       <b>raw</b>    Do  not expand properties in string arguments. (Like <b>"${property-name}"</b>.)  This is the default for
              some libmpv/scripting/IPC APIs.

       <b>expand-properties</b>
              All string arguments are expanded as described in Property Expansion.  This  is  the  default  for
              <b>input.conf</b> commands.

       <b>repeatable</b>
              For  some  commands, keeping a key pressed doesn't run the command repeatedly.  This prefix forces
              enabling key repeat in any case. For  a  list  of  commands:  the  first  command  determines  the
              repeatability of the whole list (up to and including version 0.33 - a list was always repeatable).

       <b>nonrepeatable</b>
              For  some  commands,  keeping  a  key  pressed  runs  the  command repeatedly.  This prefix forces
              disabling key repeat in any case.

       <b>nonscalable</b>
              When some commands (e.g. <b>add</b>) are bound to scalable keys  associated  to  a  high-precision  input
              device  like  a  touchpad (e.g. <b>WHEEL_UP</b>), the value specified in the command is scaled to smaller
              steps based on the high resolution input data if available.  This  prefix  forces  disabling  this
              behavior, so the value is always changed in the discrete unit specified in the key binding.

       <b>async</b>  Allow  asynchronous  execution  (if  possible).  Note  that  only a few commands will support this
              (usually this is explicitly documented). Some commands are asynchronous  by  default  (or  rather,
              their  effects  might  manifest after completion of the command). The semantics of this flag might
              change in the future. Set it only if you don't rely on the effects of  this  command  being  fully
              realized when it returns. See Synchronous vs. Asynchronous.

       <b>sync</b>   Allow  synchronous execution (if possible). Normally, all commands are synchronous by default, but
              some are asynchronous by default for compatibility with older behavior.

       All of the osd prefixes are still overridden by the global <b>--osd-level</b> settings.

   <b>Synchronous</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>Asynchronous</b>
       The <b>async</b> and <b>sync</b> prefix matter only for how the issuer of the command waits on the  completion  of  the
       command. Normally it does not affect how the command behaves by itself. There are the following cases:

       • Normal input.conf commands are always run asynchronously. Slow running commands are queued up or run in
         parallel.

       • "Multi"  input.conf commands (1 key binding, concatenated with <b>;</b>) will be executed in order, except for
         commands that are async (either prefixed with <b>async</b>, or async by default for some commands). The  async
         commands are run in a detached manner, possibly in parallel to the remaining sync commands in the list.

       • Normal  Lua  and  libmpv  commands  (e.g. <b>mpv_command()</b>) are run in a blocking manner, unless the <b>async</b>
         prefix is used, or the command is async by default. This means in the sync case the caller will  block,
         even if the core continues playback. Async mode runs the command in a detached manner.

       • Async  libmpv  command  API (e.g. <b>mpv_command_async()</b>) never blocks the caller, and always notify their
         completion with a message. The <b>sync</b> and <b>async</b> prefixes make no difference.

       • Lua also provides APIs for running async commands, which behave similar to the C counterparts.

       • In all cases, async mode can still run commands in a synchronous manner, even in  detached  mode.  This
         can for example happen in cases when a command does not have an  asynchronous implementation. The async
         libmpv API still never blocks the caller in these cases.

       Before  mpv  0.29.0,  the  <b>async</b>  prefix was only used by screenshot commands, and made them run the file
       saving code in a detached manner. This is the default now, and <b>async</b> changes behavior only  in  the  ways
       mentioned above.

       Currently  the  following  commands  have different waiting characteristics with sync vs. async: sub-add,
       audio-add, sub-reload, audio-reload, rescan-external-files, screenshot,  screenshot-to-file,  dump-cache,
       ab-loop-dump-cache.

   <b>Asynchronous</b> <b>command</b> <b>details</b>
       On  the  API  level, every asynchronous command is bound to the context which started it. For example, an
       asynchronous command started by <b>mpv_command_async</b> is bound to the <b>mpv_handle</b> passed to the function. Only
       this <b>mpv_handle</b> receives the completion notification (<b>MPV_EVENT_COMMAND_REPLY</b>), and only this handle  can
       abort a still running command directly. If the <b>mpv_handle</b> is destroyed, any still running async. commands
       started by it are terminated.

       The scripting APIs and JSON IPC give each script/connection its own implicit <b>mpv_handle</b>.

       If  the  player  is  closed,  the  core  may  abort all pending async. commands on its own (like a forced
       <b>mpv_abort_async_command()</b> call for each pending command on behalf of the API user). This happens  at  the
       same time <b>MPV_EVENT_SHUTDOWN</b> is sent, and there is no way to prevent this.

   <b>Input</b> <b>Sections</b>
       Input  sections  group  a  set  of bindings, and enable or disable them at once.  In <b>input.conf</b>, each key
       binding is assigned to an input section, rather than actually having explicit text sections.

       See also: <b>enable-section</b> and <b>disable-section</b> commands.

       Predefined bindings:

       <b>default</b>
              Bindings without input section are implicitly assigned to this section. It is enabled  by  default
              during normal playback.

       <b>encode</b> Section  which  is  active  in  encoding  mode. It is enabled exclusively, so that bindings in the
              <b>default</b> sections are ignored.

   <b>Properties</b>
       Properties are used to set mpv options during runtime, or to query arbitrary  information.  They  can  be
       manipulated  with  the  <b>set</b>/<b>add</b>/<b>cycle</b>  commands, and retrieved with <b>show-text</b>, or anything else that uses
       property expansion. (See Property Expansion.)

       If an option is referenced, the property will normally take/return exactly the same values as the option.
       In these cases, properties are merely a way to change an option at runtime.

       Note that many properties are unavailable at startup.  See  Details  on  the  script  initialization  and
       lifecycle.

   <b>Property</b> <b>list</b>
       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Most  options can be set at runtime via properties as well. Just remove the leading <b>--</b> from the option
          name. These are not documented below, see OPTIONS instead. Only  properties  which  do  not  exist  as
          option  with  the  same  name,  or  which have very different behavior from the options are documented
          below.

          Properties marked as (RW) are writeable, while those that aren't are read-only.

       <b>audio-speed-correction,</b> <b>video-speed-correction</b>
              Factor multiplied with <b>speed</b> at which the player attempts to play the file. Usually  it's  exactly
              1. (Display sync mode will make this useful.)

              OSD formatting will display it in the form of <b>+1.23456%</b>, with the number being <b>(raw</b> <b>-</b> <b>1)</b> <b>*</b> <b>100</b> for
              the given raw property value.

       <b>display-sync-active</b>
              Whether <b>--video-sync=display</b> is actually active.

       <b>filename</b>
              Currently  played  file,  with  path  stripped. If this is an URL, try to undo percent encoding as
              well. (The result is not necessarily correct, but looks better for display purposes. Use the  <b>path</b>
              property to get an unmodified filename.)

              This has a sub-property:

              <b>filename/no-ext</b>
                     Like  the <b>filename</b> property, but if the text contains a <b>.</b>, strip all text after the last <b>.</b>.
                     Usually this removes the file extension.

       <b>file-size</b>
              Length  in  bytes  of  the  source  file/stream.  (This  is  the  same   as   <b>${stream-end}</b>.   For
              segmented/multi-part  files,  this  will return the size of the main or manifest file, whatever it
              is.)

       <b>estimated-frame-count</b>
              Total number of frames in current file.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This is only an estimate. (It's  computed  from  two  unreliable  quantities:  fps  and  stream
                 length.)

       <b>estimated-frame-number</b>
              Number of current frame in current stream.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This  is  only  an  estimate.  (It's  computed from two unreliable quantities: fps and possibly
                 rounded timestamps.)

       <b>pid</b>    Process-id of mpv.

       <b>path</b>   Full absolute path of the currently played file.

       <b>stream-open-filename</b>
              The full path to the currently played media. This is different from <b>path</b> only in special cases. In
              particular, if <b>--ytdl=yes</b> is used, and the URL is detected by <b>youtube-dl</b>, then the script will set
              this property to the actual media URL. This property should be set  only  during  the  <b>on_load</b>  or
              <b>on_load_fail</b>  hooks,  otherwise it will have no effect (or may do something implementation defined
              in the future). The property is reset if playback of the current media ends.

       <b>media-title</b>
              If the currently played file has a <b>title</b> tag, use that.

              Otherwise, return the <b>filename</b> property.

       <b>file-format</b>
              Symbolic name of the file format. In some cases, this is a comma-separated list of  format  names,
              e.g. mp4 is <b>mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2</b> (the list may grow in the future for any format).

       <b>current-demuxer</b>
              Name of the current demuxer. (This is useless.)

              (Renamed from <b>demuxer</b>.)

       <b>stream-path</b>
              Filename  (full  path) of the stream layer filename. (This is probably useless and is almost never
              different from <b>path</b>.)

       <b>stream-pos</b>
              Raw byte position in source stream. Technically, this returns the  position  of  the  most  recent
              packet passed to a decoder.

       <b>stream-end</b>
              Raw end position in bytes in source stream.

       <b>duration</b>
              Duration  of the current file in seconds. If the duration is unknown, the property is unavailable.
              Note that the file duration is not always exactly known, so this is an estimate.

              This replaces the <b>length</b> property, which was deprecated after the mpv 0.9 release. (The  semantics
              are the same.)

              This has a sub-property:

              <b>duration/full</b>
                     <b>duration</b> with milliseconds.

       <b>avsync</b> Last A/V synchronization difference. Unavailable if audio or video is disabled.

       <b>total-avsync-change</b>
              Total A-V sync correction done. Unavailable if audio or video is disabled.

       <b>decoder-frame-drop-count</b>
              Video   frames   dropped   by  decoder,  because  video  is  too  far  behind  audio  (when  using
              <b>--framedrop=decoder</b>). Sometimes, this may be incremented in  other  situations,  e.g.  when  video
              packets  are  damaged,  or  the  decoder  doesn't  follow the usual rules. Unavailable if video is
              disabled.

       <b>frame-drop-count</b>
              Frames dropped by VO (when using <b>--framedrop=vo</b>).

       <b>mistimed-frame-count</b>
              Number of video frames that were not timed correctly in display-sync mode for the sake of  keeping
              A/V  sync. This does not include external circumstances, such as video rendering being too slow or
              the graphics driver somehow skipping a vsync. It does not include rounding  errors  either  (which
              can  happen  especially  with  bad  source timestamps). For example, using the <b>display-desync</b> mode
              should never change this value from 0.

       <b>vsync-ratio</b>
              For how many vsyncs a frame is displayed on average. This is available if display-sync  is  active
              only.  For  30  FPS  video  on  a 60 Hz screen, this will be 2. This is the moving average of what
              actually has been scheduled, so 24 FPS on 60 Hz will never  remain  exactly  on  2.5,  but  jitter
              depending on the last frame displayed.

       <b>vo-delayed-frame-count</b>
              Estimated  number  of frames delayed due to external circumstances in display-sync mode. Note that
              in general, mpv has to guess that this is happening, and the guess can be inaccurate.

       <b>percent-pos</b> <b>(RW)</b>
              Position in current file (0-100). The advantage over using this instead of calculating it  out  of
              other  properties is that it properly falls back to estimating the playback position from the byte
              position, if the file duration is not known.

       <b>time-pos</b> <b>(RW)</b>
              Position in current file in seconds.

              This has a sub-property:

              <b>time-pos/full</b>
                     <b>time-pos</b> with milliseconds.

       <b>time-start</b>
              Deprecated. Always returns 0. Before mpv 0.14, this used to return the  start  time  of  the  file
              (could affect e.g. transport streams). See <b>--rebase-start-time</b> option.

       <b>time-remaining</b>
              Remaining  length of the file in seconds. Note that the file duration is not always exactly known,
              so this is an estimate.

              This has a sub-property:

              <b>time-remaining/full</b>
                     <b>time-remaining</b> with milliseconds.

       <b>audio-pts</b>
              Current audio playback position in current file in seconds. Unlike  <b>time-pos</b>,  this  updates  more
              often  than  once per frame. This is mostly equivalent to <b>time-pos</b> for audio-only files however it
              also takes into account the audio driver delay. This can lead to negative values in certain cases,
              so in general you probably want to simply use <b>time-pos</b>.

              This has a sub-property:

              <b>audio-pts/full</b>
                     <b>audio-pts</b> with milliseconds.

       <b>playtime-remaining</b>
              <b>time-remaining</b> scaled by the current <b>speed</b>.

              This has a sub-property:

              <b>playtime-remaining/full</b>
                     <b>playtime-remaining</b> with milliseconds.

       <b>playback-time</b> <b>(RW)</b>
              Alias for <b>time-pos</b>.

              Prior to mpv 0.39.0, <b>time-pos</b> and <b>playback-time</b> could report  different  values  in  certain  edge
              cases.

              This has a sub-property:

              <b>playback-time/full</b>
                     <b>playback-time</b> with milliseconds.

       <b>remaining-file-loops</b>
              How  many more times the current file is going to be looped. This is initialized from the value of
              <b>--loop-file</b>. This counts the number of times it causes the player to seek to the beginning of  the
              file, so it is 0 the last the time is played. -1 corresponds to infinity.

       <b>remaining-ab-loops</b>
              How  many  more  times  the  current  A-B  loop  is  going to be looped, if one is active. This is
              initialized from the value of <b>--ab-loop-count</b>. This counts the  number  of  times  it  causes  the
              player  to seek to <b>--ab-loop-a</b>, so it is 0 the last the time the loop is played. -1 corresponds to
              infinity.

       <b>chapter</b> <b>(RW)</b>
              Current chapter number. The number of the first chapter is 0.  A value of -1  indicates  that  the
              current playback position is before the start of the first chapter,

              Setting  this  property  results  in an absolute seek to the start of the chapter. However, if the
              property is changed with <b>add</b> or <b>cycle</b> command which results in a decrement in value, it may go  to
              the  start  of  the current chapter instead of the previous chapter.  See <b>--chapter-seek-threshold</b>
              for details.

       <b>edition</b> <b>(RW)</b>
              Current edition number. Setting this property to a different  value  will  restart  playback.  The
              number of the first edition is 0.

              For Matroska files, this is the edition. For DVD/Blu-ray, this is the title.

              Before  mpv  0.31.0,  this  showed  the  actual edition selected at runtime, if you didn't set the
              option or property manually. With mpv 0.31.0 and later, this strictly returns the user-set  option
              or  property  value,  and  the  <b>current-edition</b>  property was added to return the runtime selected
              edition (this matters with <b>--edition=auto</b>, the default).

       <b>current-edition</b>
              Currently selected edition. This property is unavailable if no file is loaded, or the file has  no
              editions. (Matroska files make a difference between having no editions and a single edition, which
              will be reflected by the property, although in practice it does not matter.)

       <b>chapters</b>
              Number of chapters.

       <b>editions</b>
              Number of editions.

       <b>edition-list</b>
              List of editions, current entry marked.

              This has a number of sub-properties. Replace <b>N</b> with the 0-based edition index.

              <b>edition-list/count</b>
                     Number  of  editions.  If there are no editions, this can be 0 or 1 (1 if there's a useless
                     dummy edition).

              <b>edition-list/N/id</b>
                     Edition ID as integer. Currently, this is the same as the edition index.

              <b>edition-list/N/default</b>
                     Whether this is the default edition.

              <b>edition-list/N/title</b>
                     Edition title as stored in the file. Not always available.

              When  querying  the  property  with  the  client  API   using   <b>MPV_FORMAT_NODE</b>,   or   with   Lua
              <b>mp.get_property_native</b>, this will return a mpv_node with the following contents:

                 MPV_FORMAT_NODE_ARRAY
                     MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP (for each edition)
                         "id"                MPV_FORMAT_INT64
                         "title"             MPV_FORMAT_STRING
                         "default"           MPV_FORMAT_FLAG

       <b>metadata</b>
              Metadata key/value pairs.

              If  the property is accessed with Lua's <b>mp.get_property_native</b>, this returns a table with metadata
              keys mapping to metadata  values.  If  it  is  accessed  with  the  client  API,  this  returns  a
              <b>MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP</b>, with tag keys mapping to tag values.

              For  OSD,  it  returns  a formatted list. Trying to retrieve this property as a raw string doesn't
              work.

              This has a number of sub-properties:

              <b>metadata/by-key/&lt;key&gt;</b>
                     Value of metadata entry <b>&lt;key&gt;</b>.

              <b>metadata/list/count</b>
                     Number of metadata entries.

              <b>metadata/list/N/key</b>
                     Key name of the Nth metadata entry. (The first entry is <b>0</b>).

              <b>metadata/list/N/value</b>
                     Value of the Nth metadata entry.

              <b>metadata/&lt;key&gt;</b>
                     Old version of <b>metadata/by-key/&lt;key&gt;</b>. Use is discouraged, because the metadata  key  string
                     could conflict with other sub-properties.

              The  layout  of this property might be subject to change. Suggestions are welcome how exactly this
              property should work.

              When  querying  the  property  with  the  client  API   using   <b>MPV_FORMAT_NODE</b>,   or   with   Lua
              <b>mp.get_property_native</b>, this will return a mpv_node with the following contents:

                 MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP
                     (key and string value for each metadata entry)

       <b>filtered-metadata</b>
              Like  <b>metadata</b>, but includes only fields listed in the <b>--display-tags</b> option. This is the same set
              of tags that is printed to the terminal.

       <b>chapter-metadata</b>
              Metadata of current chapter. Works similar to <b>metadata</b> property. It also allows  the  same  access
              methods (using sub-properties).

              Per-chapter metadata is very rare. Usually, only the chapter name (<b>title</b>) is set.

              For accessing other information, like chapter start, see the <b>chapter-list</b> property.

       <b>vf-metadata/&lt;filter-label&gt;</b>
              Metadata  added by video filters. Accessed by the filter label, which, if not explicitly specified
              using the <b>@filter-label:</b> syntax, will be <b>&lt;filter-name&gt;.NN</b>.

              Works similar to <b>metadata</b> property. It allows the same access methods (using sub-properties).

              An example of this kind of metadata are the cropping parameters added by <b>--vf=lavfi=cropdetect</b>.

       <b>af-metadata/&lt;filter-label&gt;</b>
              Equivalent to <b>vf-metadata/&lt;filter-label&gt;</b>, but for audio filters.

       <b>deinterlace-active</b>
              Returns <b>yes</b>/true if mpv's deinterlacing filter is  active.  Note  that  it  will  not  detect  any
              manually inserted deinterlacing filters done via <b>--vf</b>.

       <b>idle-active</b>
              Returns  <b>yes</b>/true  if  no  file  is loaded, but the player is staying around because of the <b>--idle</b>
              option.

              (Renamed from <b>idle</b>.)

       <b>core-idle</b>
              Whether the playback core is paused. This can differ from <b>pause</b> in  special  situations,  such  as
              when the player pauses itself due to low network cache.

              This  also  returns  <b>yes</b>/true  if playback is restarting or if nothing is playing at all. In other
              words, it's only <b>no</b>/false if there's actually video playing. (Behavior since mpv 0.7.0.)

       <b>cache-speed</b>
              Current I/O read speed between the cache and the lower  layer  (like  network).   This  gives  the
              number  bytes  per  seconds over a 1 second window (using the type <b>MPV_FORMAT_INT64</b> for the client
              API).

              This is the same as <b>demuxer-cache-state/raw-input-rate</b>.

       <b>demuxer-cache-duration</b>
              Approximate duration of video buffered in the demuxer, in seconds. The guess is  very  unreliable,
              and often the property will not be available at all, even if data is buffered.

       <b>demuxer-cache-time</b>
              Approximate  time of video buffered in the demuxer, in seconds. Same as <b>demuxer-cache-duration</b> but
              returns the last timestamp of buffered data in demuxer.

       <b>demuxer-cache-idle</b>
              Whether the demuxer is idle, which means that the demuxer cache is filled to the requested amount,
              and is currently not reading more data.

       <b>demuxer-cache-state</b>
              Each entry in <b>seekable-ranges</b> represents a region in the demuxer cache that can be seeked to, with
              a <b>start</b> and <b>end</b> fields containing the  respective  timestamps.  If  there  are  multiple  demuxers
              active,  this only returns information about the "main" demuxer, but might be changed in future to
              return unified information about all demuxers. The ranges are in arbitrary  order.  Often,  ranges
              will  overlap for a bit, before being joined.  In broken corner cases, ranges may overlap all over
              the place.

              The end of a seek range is usually smaller than  the  value  returned  by  the  <b>demuxer-cache-time</b>
              property,  because  that  property  returns  the  guessed  buffering amount, while the seek ranges
              represent the buffered data that can actually be used for cached seeking.

              <b>bof-cached</b> indicates whether the seek range with the lowest timestamp points to the  beginning  of
              the  stream  (BOF). This implies you cannot seek before this position at all. <b>eof-cached</b> indicates
              whether the seek range with the highest timestamp points to the end of the stream (EOF).  If  both
              <b>bof-cached</b> and <b>eof-cached</b> are true, and there's only 1 cache range, the entire stream is cached.

              <b>fw-bytes</b>  is  the  number  of  bytes  of  packets  buffered in the range starting from the current
              decoding position. This is a rough estimate (may not account correctly for various overhead),  and
              stops at the demuxer position (it ignores seek ranges after it).

              <b>file-cache-bytes</b>  is the number of bytes stored in the file cache. This includes all overhead, and
              possibly unused data (like pruned data). This member is missing if the file cache  wasn't  enabled
              with <b>--cache-on-disk=yes</b>.

              <b>cache-end</b> is <b>demuxer-cache-time</b>. Missing if unavailable.

              <b>reader-pts</b>  is  the  approximate  timestamp  of  the  start  of  the  buffered  range.  Missing if
              unavailable.

              <b>cache-duration</b> is <b>demuxer-cache-duration</b>. Missing if unavailable.

              <b>raw-input-rate</b> is the estimated input rate of the network layer (or any other byte-oriented  input
              layer) in bytes per second. May be inaccurate or missing.

              <b>ts-per-stream</b>  is  an  array containing an entry for each stream type: video, audio, and subtitle.
              For each stream type, the details for the demuxer cache for that  stream  type  are  available  as
              <b>cache-duration</b>, <b>reader-pts</b> and <b>cache-end</b>.

              When   querying   the   property   with   the  client  API  using  <b>MPV_FORMAT_NODE</b>,  or  with  Lua
              <b>mp.get_property_native</b>, this will return a mpv_node with the following contents:

                 MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP
                     "seekable-ranges"   MPV_FORMAT_NODE_ARRAY
                         MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP
                             "start"             MPV_FORMAT_DOUBLE
                             "end"               MPV_FORMAT_DOUBLE
                     "bof-cached"        MPV_FORMAT_FLAG
                     "eof-cached"        MPV_FORMAT_FLAG
                     "fw-bytes"          MPV_FORMAT_INT64
                     "file-cache-bytes"  MPV_FORMAT_INT64
                     "cache-end"         MPV_FORMAT_DOUBLE
                     "reader-pts"        MPV_FORMAT_DOUBLE
                     "cache-duration"    MPV_FORMAT_DOUBLE
                     "raw-input-rate"    MPV_FORMAT_INT64
                     "ts-per-stream"     MPV_FORMAT_NODE_ARRAY
                         MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP
                               "type"            MPV_FORMAT_STRING
                               "cache-duration"  MPV_FORMAT_DOUBLE
                               "reader-pts"      MPV_FORMAT_DOUBLE
                               "cache-end"       MPV_FORMAT_DOUBLE

              Other fields (might be changed or removed in the future):

              <b>eof</b>    Whether the reader thread has hit the end of the file.

              <b>underrun</b>
                     Whether the reader thread could not satisfy a decoder's request for a new packet.

              <b>idle</b>   Whether the thread is currently not reading.

              <b>total-bytes</b>
                     Sum of packet bytes (plus some overhead estimation) of the entire packet  queue,  including
                     cached seekable ranges.

       <b>demuxer-via-network</b>
              Whether  the  stream  demuxed  via  the  main  demuxer  is  most  likely  played via network. What
              constitutes "network" is not always clear, might be used for other  types  of  untrusted  streams,
              could  be wrong in certain cases, and its definition might be changing. Also, external files (like
              separate audio files or streams) do not influence the value of this property (currently).

       <b>demuxer-start-time</b>
              The start time reported by the demuxer in fractional seconds.

       <b>paused-for-cache</b>
              Whether playback is paused because of waiting for the cache.

       <b>cache-buffering-state</b>
              The percentage (0-100) of the cache  fill  status  until  the  player  will  unpause  (related  to
              <b>paused-for-cache</b>).

       <b>eof-reached</b>
              Whether the end of playback was reached. Note that this is usually interesting only if <b>--keep-open</b>
              is  enabled, since otherwise the player will immediately play the next file (or exit or enter idle
              mode), and in these cases the <b>eof-reached</b> property will logically  be  cleared  immediately  after
              it's set.

       <b>seeking</b>
              Whether  the  player is currently seeking, or otherwise trying to restart playback. (It's possible
              that it returns <b>yes</b>/true while a file is loaded. This is because the same underlying code is  used
              for seeking and resyncing.)

       <b>mixer-active</b>
              Whether the audio mixer is active.

              This  option  is  relatively useless. Before mpv 0.18.1, it could be used to infer behavior of the
              <b>volume</b> property.

       <b>ao-volume</b> <b>(RW)</b>
              System volume. This property is available only if mpv audio output is currently active,  and  only
              if  the underlying implementation supports volume control. What this option does, or how the value
              is interpreted depends on the API. For example, on ALSA this  usually  changes  system-wide  audio
              volume  on  a  linear curve, while with PulseAudio this controls per-application volume on a cubic
              curve.

       <b>ao-mute</b> <b>(RW)</b>
              Similar to <b>ao-volume</b>, but controls the mute state. May be unimplemented even if <b>ao-volume</b> works.

       <b>audio-params</b>
              Audio format as output by the audio decoder.  This has a number of sub-properties:

              <b>audio-params/format</b>
                     The sample format as string. This uses the same names as used in other places of mpv.

              <b>audio-params/samplerate</b>
                     Samplerate.

              <b>audio-params/channels</b>
                     The channel layout as a string. This is similar to what the <b>--audio-channels</b> accepts.

              <b>audio-params/hr-channels</b>
                     As <b>channels</b>, but instead of the possibly cryptic actual layout sent to  the  audio  device,
                     return  a  hopefully  more human readable form.  (Usually only <b>audio-out-params/hr-channels</b>
                     makes sense.)

              <b>audio-params/channel-count</b>
                     Number of audio channels. This is redundant to the <b>channels</b> field described above.

              When  querying  the  property  with  the  client  API   using   <b>MPV_FORMAT_NODE</b>,   or   with   Lua
              <b>mp.get_property_native</b>, this will return a mpv_node with the following contents:

                 MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP
                     "format"            MPV_FORMAT_STRING
                     "samplerate"        MPV_FORMAT_INT64
                     "channels"          MPV_FORMAT_STRING
                     "channel-count"     MPV_FORMAT_INT64
                     "hr-channels"       MPV_FORMAT_STRING

       <b>audio-out-params</b>
              Same as <b>audio-params</b>, but the format of the data written to the audio API.

       <b>colormatrix</b>
              Redirects  to <b>video-params/colormatrix</b>. This parameter (as well as similar ones) can be overridden
              with the <b>format</b> video filter.

       <b>colormatrix-input-range</b>
              See <b>colormatrix</b>.

       <b>colormatrix-primaries</b>
              See <b>colormatrix</b>.

       <b>hwdec</b> <b>(RW)</b>
              Reflects the <b>--hwdec</b> option.

              Writing to it may change the currently used  hardware  decoder,  if  possible.   (Internally,  the
              player  may  reinitialize the decoder, and will perform a seek to refresh the video properly.) You
              can watch the other hwdec properties to see whether this was successful.

              Unlike in mpv 0.9.x and before, this does not return the currently active hardware decoder.  Since
              mpv 0.18.0, <b>hwdec-current</b> is available for this purpose.

       <b>hwdec-current</b>
              The  current hardware decoding in use. If decoding is active, return one of the values used by the
              <b>hwdec</b> option/property. <b>no</b>/false indicates software decoding. If no decoder is loaded, the property
              is unavailable.

       <b>hwdec-interop</b>
              This returns the currently loaded hardware decoding/output interop driver.   This  is  known  only
              once  the  VO has opened (and possibly later). With some VOs (like <b>gpu</b>), this might be never known
              in advance, but only when the decoder attempted to create  the  hw  decoder  successfully.  (Using
              <b>--gpu-hwdec-interop</b>  can  load  it  eagerly.)  If  there are multiple drivers loaded, they will be
              separated by <b>,</b>.

              If no VO is active or no interop driver is known, this property is unavailable.

              This does not necessarily use the same values as <b>hwdec</b>. There can be multiple interop drivers  for
              the same hardware decoder, depending on platform and VO.

       <b>width,</b> <b>height</b>
              Video size. This uses the size of the video as decoded, or if no video frame has been decoded yet,
              the (possibly incorrect) container indicated size.

       <b>video-params</b>
              Video  parameters,  as output by the decoder (with overrides like aspect etc. applied). This has a
              number of sub-properties:

              <b>video-params/pixelformat</b>
                     The pixel format as string. This uses the same names as used in other places of mpv.

              <b>video-params/hw-pixelformat</b>
                     The underlying pixel format as string. This is relevant for some cases of hardware decoding
                     and unavailable otherwise.

              <b>video-params/average-bpp</b>
                     Average bits-per-pixel as integer. Subsampled planar formats use  a  different  resolution,
                     which  is  the reason this value can sometimes be odd or confusing. Can be unavailable with
                     some formats.

              <b>video-params/w,</b> <b>video-params/h</b>
                     Video size as integers, with no aspect correction applied.

              <b>video-params/dw,</b> <b>video-params/dh</b>
                     Video size as integers, scaled for correct aspect ratio.

              <b>video-params/crop-x,</b> <b>video-params/crop-y</b>
                     Crop offset of the source video frame.

              <b>video-params/crop-w,</b> <b>video-params/crop-h</b>
                     Video size after cropping.

              <b>video-params/aspect</b>
                     Display aspect ratio as double.

              <b>video-params/aspect-name</b>
                     Display aspect ratio name as string. The name corresponds to  motion  picture  film  format
                     that introduced given aspect ratio in film.

              <b>video-params/par</b>
                     Pixel aspect ratio.

              <b>video-params/sar</b>
                     Storage aspect ratio.

              <b>video-params/sar-name</b>
                     Storage aspect ratio name as string.

              <b>video-params/colormatrix</b>
                     The colormatrix in use as string. (Exact values subject to change.)

              <b>video-params/colorlevels</b>
                     The colorlevels as string. (Exact values subject to change.)

              <b>video-params/primaries</b>
                     The primaries in use as string. (Exact values subject to change.)

              <b>video-params/gamma</b>
                     The gamma function in use as string. (Exact values subject to change.)

              <b>video-params/sig-peak</b> <b>(deprecated)</b>
                     The video file's tagged signal peak as float.

              <b>video-params/light</b>
                     The light type in use as a string. (Exact values subject to change.)

              <b>video-params/chroma-location</b>
                     Chroma location as string. (Exact values subject to change.)

              <b>video-params/rotate</b>
                     Intended display rotation in degrees (clockwise).

              <b>video-params/stereo-in</b>
                     Source file stereo 3D mode. (See the <b>format</b> video filter's <b>stereo-in</b> option.)

              <b>video-params/alpha</b>
                     Alpha  type.  If  the  format has no alpha channel, this will be unavailable (but in future
                     releases, it could change to <b>no</b>). If alpha is present, this is set to <b>straight</b> or <b>premul</b>.

              <b>video-params/min-luma</b>
                     Minimum luminance, as reported by HDR10 metadata (in cd/m²)

              <b>video-params/max-luma</b>
                     Maximum luminance, as reported by HDR10 metadata (in cd/m²)

              <b>video-params/max-cll</b>
                     Maximum content light level, as reported by HDR10 metadata (in cd/m²)

              <b>video-params/max-fall</b>
                     Maximum frame average light level, as reported by HDR10 metadata (in cd/m²)

              <b>video-params/scene-max-r</b>
                     MaxRGB of a scene for R component, as reported by HDR10+ metadata (in cd/m²)

              <b>video-params/scene-max-g</b>
                     MaxRGB of a scene for G component, as reported by HDR10+ metadata (in cd/m²)

              <b>video-params/scene-max-b</b>
                     MaxRGB of a scene for B component, as reported by HDR10+ metadata (in cd/m²)

              <b>video-params/max-pq-y</b>
                     Maximum PQ luminance of a frame, as reported by peak detection (in PQ, 0-1)

              <b>video-params/avg-pq-y</b>
                     Average PQ luminance of a frame, as reported by peak detection (in PQ, 0-1)

              When  querying  the  property  with  the  client  API   using   <b>MPV_FORMAT_NODE</b>,   or   with   Lua
              <b>mp.get_property_native</b>, this will return a mpv_node with the following contents:

                     "avg-pq-y"          MPV_FORMAT_DOUBLE

       <b>dwidth,</b> <b>dheight</b>
              Video display size. This is the video size after filters and aspect scaling have been applied. The
              actual  video  window  size  can  still be different from this, e.g. if the user resized the video
              window manually.

              These have the same values as <b>video-out-params/dw</b> and <b>video-out-params/dh</b>.

       <b>video-dec-params</b>
              Exactly like <b>video-params</b>, but no overrides applied.

       <b>video-out-params</b>
              Same as <b>video-params</b>, but after video filters have been applied. If there are no video filters  in
              use,  this  will  contain the same values as <b>video-params</b>. Note that this is still not necessarily
              what the video window uses, since the user can change the window size, and all real VOs  do  their
              own scaling independently from the filter chain.

              Has the same sub-properties as <b>video-params</b>.

       <b>video-target-params</b>
              Same as <b>video-params</b>, but with the target properties that VO outputs to.

              Has the same sub-properties as <b>video-params</b>.

       <b>video-frame-info</b>
              Approximate  information  of  the  current  frame.  Note that if any of these are used on OSD, the
              information might be off by a few frames due to OSD redrawing and  frame  display  being  somewhat
              disconnected, and you might have to pause and force a redraw.

              This has a number of sub-properties:

              <b>video-frame-info/picture-type</b>
                     The  type of the picture. It can be "I" (intra), "P" (predicted), "B" (bi-dir predicted) or
                     unavailable.

              <b>video-frame-info/interlaced</b>
                     Whether the content of the frame is interlaced.

              <b>video-frame-info/tff</b>
                     If the content is interlaced, whether the top field is displayed first.

              <b>video-frame-info/repeat</b>
                     Whether the frame must be delayed when decoding.

              <b>video-frame-info/gop-timecode</b>
                     String with the GOP timecode encoded in the frame.

              <b>video-frame-info/smpte-timecode</b>
                     String with the SMPTE timecode encoded in the frame.

              <b>video-frame-info/estimated-smpte-timecode</b>
                     Estimated timecode based on the current playback position and frame count.

       <b>container-fps</b>
              Container FPS. This can easily contain bogus values. For videos that use modern container  formats
              or video codecs, this will often be incorrect.

              (Renamed from <b>fps</b>.)

       <b>estimated-vf-fps</b>
              Estimated/measured FPS of the video filter chain output. (If no filters are used, this corresponds
              to  decoder output.) This uses the average of the 10 past frame durations to calculate the FPS. It
              will be inaccurate if frame-dropping is involved (such as when framedrop is explicitly enabled, or
              after precise seeking). Files with imprecise timestamps (such as Matroska) might lead to  unstable
              results.

       <b>current-window-scale</b> <b>(RW)</b>
              The  <b>window-scale</b>  value  calculated  from  the  current  window  size. This has the same value as
              <b>window-scale</b> if the window size was not changed since setting the option, and the window size  was
              not  restricted  in  other  ways.  If the window is fullscreened, this will return the scale value
              calculated from the last non-fullscreen size of the window. The  property  is  unavailable  if  no
              video is active.

              It is also possible to write to this property. This has the same behavior as writing <b>window-scale</b>.
              Note that writing to <b>current-window-scale</b> will not affect the value of <b>window-scale</b>.

       <b>focused</b>
              Whether the window has focus. Might not be supported by all VOs.

       <b>ambient-light</b>
              Ambient lighting condition in lux. (macOS only)

       <b>display-names</b>
              Names  of  the  displays  that  the  mpv window covers. On X11, these are the xrandr names (LVDS1,
              HDMI1, DP1, VGA1, etc.). On Windows, these are the GDI names (\.DISPLAY1,  \.DISPLAY2,  etc.)  and
              the  first  display  in the list will be the one that Windows considers associated with the window
              (as determined by the MonitorFromWindow API.) On macOS these are the Display Product Names as used
              in the System Information with a serial number  in  parentheses  and  only  one  display  name  is
              returned  since  a  window can only be on one screen. On Wayland, these are the wl_output names if
              protocol version &gt;= 4 is used (LVDS-1, HDMI-A-1, X11-1, etc.), or the wl_output model reported  by
              the geometry event if protocol version &lt; 4 is used.

       <b>display-fps</b>
              The  refresh rate of the current display. Currently, this is the lowest FPS of any display covered
              by the video, as retrieved by the underlying system APIs (e.g. xrandr  on  X11).  It  is  not  the
              measured  FPS.  It's not necessarily available on all platforms. Note that any of the listed facts
              may change any time without a warning.

       <b>estimated-display-fps</b>
              The actual rate at which display refreshes seem to occur, measured by system time. Only  available
              if display-sync mode (as selected by <b>--video-sync</b>) is active.

       <b>vsync-jitter</b>
              Estimated deviation factor of the vsync duration.

       <b>display-width,</b> <b>display-height</b>
              The  current  display's  horizontal and vertical resolution in pixels. Whether or not these values
              update as the mpv window changes displays  depends  on  the  windowing  backend.  It  may  not  be
              available on all platforms.

       <b>display-hidpi-scale</b>
              The HiDPI scale factor as reported by the windowing backend. If no VO is active, or if the VO does
              not  report  a  value,  this  property is unavailable.  It may be saner to report an absolute DPI,
              however,  this  is  the  way  HiDPI  support  is  implemented  on   most   OS   APIs.   See   also
              <b>--hidpi-window-scale</b>.

       <b>osd-width,</b> <b>osd-height</b>
              Last  known  OSD  width  (can be 0). This is needed if you want to use the <b>overlay-add</b> command. It
              gives you the actual OSD/window size (not including decorations drawn by the OS window manager).

              Alias to <b>osd-dimensions/w</b> and <b>osd-dimensions/h</b>.

       <b>osd-par</b>
              Last known OSD display pixel aspect (can be 0).

              Alias to <b>osd-dimensions/osd-par</b>.

       <b>osd-dimensions</b>
              Last known OSD dimensions.

              Has the following sub-properties  (which  can  be  read  as  <b>MPV_FORMAT_NODE</b>  or  Lua  table  with
              <b>mp.get_property_native</b>):

              <b>osd-dimensions/w</b>
                     Size  of  the  VO window in OSD render units (usually pixels, but may be scaled pixels with
                     VOs like <b>xv</b>).

              <b>osd-dimensions/h</b>
                     Size of the VO window in OSD render units,

              <b>osd-dimensions/par</b>
                     Pixel aspect ratio of the OSD (usually 1).

              <b>osd-dimensions/aspect</b>
                     Display aspect ratio of the VO window. (Computing from the properties above.)

              <b>osd-dimensions/mt,</b> <b>osd-dimensions/mb,</b> <b>osd-dimensions/ml,</b> <b>osd-dimensions/mr</b>
                     OSD to video margins (top, bottom, left, right). This describes the  area  into  which  the
                     video is rendered.

              Any  of these properties may be unavailable or set to dummy values if the VO window is not created
              or visible.

       <b>term-size</b>
              The current terminal size.

              This has two sub-properties.

              <b>term-size/w</b>
                     width of the terminal in cells

              <b>term-size/h</b>
                     height of the terminal in cells

              This property is not observable. Reacting to size changes requires polling.

       <b>window-id</b>
              Read-only - mpv's window id. May not always be available, i.e due to window not being  opened  yet
              or not being supported by the VO.

       <b>mouse-pos</b>
              Read-only - last known mouse position, normalized to OSD dimensions.

              Has  the  following  sub-properties  (which  can  be  read  as  <b>MPV_FORMAT_NODE</b>  or Lua table with
              <b>mp.get_property_native</b>):

              <b>mouse-pos/x,</b> <b>mouse-pos/y</b>
                     Last known coordinates of the mouse pointer.

              <b>mouse-pos/hover</b>
                     Boolean - whether the mouse pointer hovers the video  window.  The  coordinates  should  be
                     ignored  when  this  value  is  false, because the video backends update them only when the
                     pointer hovers the window.

       <b>touch-pos</b>
              Read-only - last known touch point positions, normalized to OSD dimensions.

              This has a number of sub-properties. Replace <b>N</b> with the 0-based touch point index. Whenever a  new
              finger  touches  the  screen,  a  new  touch  point  is added to the list of touch points with the
              smallest unused <b>N</b> available.

              <b>touch-pos/count</b>
                     Number of active touch points.

              <b>touch-pos/N/x,</b> <b>touch-pos/N/y</b>
                     Position of the Nth touch point.

              <b>touch-pos/N/id</b>
                     Unique identifier of the touch point. This can be used to identify individual touch  points
                     when their indexes change.

              When   querying   the   property   with   the  client  API  using  <b>MPV_FORMAT_NODE</b>,  or  with  Lua
              <b>mp.get_property_native</b>, this will return a mpv_node with the following contents:

                 MPV_FORMAT_NODE_ARRAY
                     MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP (for each touch point)
                         "x"        MPV_FORMAT_INT64
                         "y"        MPV_FORMAT_INT64
                         "id"       MPV_FORMAT_INT64

       <b>sub-ass-extradata</b>
              The current ASS subtitle track's extradata.  There  is  no  formatting  done.   The  extradata  is
              returned as a string as-is. This property is not available for non-ASS subtitle tracks.

       <b>sub-text</b>
              The current subtitle text regardless of sub visibility. Formatting is stripped. If the subtitle is
              not text-based (i.e. DVD/BD subtitles), an empty string is returned.

              This has sub-properties for different formats:

              <b>sub-text/ass</b>
                     Like  <b>sub-text</b>,  but  return  the  text  in ASS format. Text subtitles in other formats are
                     converted. For native ASS subtitles, events that  do  not  contain  any  text  (but  vector
                     drawings  etc.)  are  not  filtered out. If multiple events match with the current playback
                     time, they are concatenated with line breaks. Contains only the "Text" part of the events.

                     This property is not enough to render ASS  subtitles  correctly,  because  ASS  header  and
                     per-event metadata are not returned. Use <b>/ass-full</b> for that.

              <b>sub-text/ass-full</b>
                     Like  <b>sub-text-ass</b>, but return the full event with all fields, formatted as lines in a .ass
                     text file. Use with <b>sub-ass-extradata</b> for style information.

       <b>sub-text-ass</b> <b>(deprecated)</b>
              Deprecated alias for <b>sub-text/ass</b>.

       <b>secondary-sub-text</b>
              Same as <b>sub-text</b> (with the same sub-properties), but for the secondary subtitles.

       <b>sub-start</b>
              The current subtitle start time (in seconds). If there's multiple current subtitles,  returns  the
              first start time. If no current subtitle is present null is returned instead.

              This has a sub-property:

              <b>sub-start/full</b>
                     <b>sub-start</b> with milliseconds.

       <b>secondary-sub-start</b>
              Same as <b>sub-start</b>, but for the secondary subtitles.

       <b>sub-end</b>
              The current subtitle end time (in seconds). If there's multiple current subtitles, return the last
              end  time.  If  no  current  subtitle  is present, or if it's present but has unknown or incorrect
              duration, null is returned instead.

              This has a sub-property:

              <b>sub-end/full</b>
                     <b>sub-end</b> with milliseconds.

       <b>secondary-sub-end</b>
              Same as <b>sub-end</b>, but for the secondary subtitles.

       <b>playlist-pos</b> <b>(RW)</b>
              Current position on playlist. The first entry is on position 0. Writing to this property may start
              playback at the new position.

              In some cases, this is not necessarily the currently playing file. See explanation of <b>current</b>  and
              <b>playing</b> flags in <b>playlist</b>.

              If  there  the  playlist  is empty, or if it's non-empty, but no entry is "current", this property
              returns -1. Likewise, writing -1 will put the player into idle mode (or exit playback if idle mode
              is not enabled). If an out of range index is written to the property, this behaves as  if  writing
              -1.   (Before  mpv  0.33.0,  instead of returning -1, this property was unavailable if no playlist
              entry was current.)

              Writing the current value back to the property will have no effect.   Use  <b>playlist-play-index</b>  to
              restart the playback of the current entry if desired.

       <b>playlist-pos-1</b> <b>(RW)</b>
              Same as <b>playlist-pos</b>, but 1-based.

       <b>playlist-current-pos</b> <b>(RW)</b>
              Index  of the "current" item on playlist. This usually, but not necessarily, the currently playing
              item (see <b>playlist-playing-pos</b>). Depending on the exact internal state of the player, it may refer
              to the playlist item to play next, or the playlist item used to determine what to play next.

              For reading, this is exactly the same as <b>playlist-pos</b>.

              For writing, this <u>only</u> sets the position of the "current" item, without stopping playback  of  the
              current  file  (or  starting playback, if this is done in idle mode). Use -1 to remove the current
              flag.

              This property is only vaguely useful. If set during playback, it will typically cause the playlist
              entry <u>after</u> it to be played next. Another possibly odd observable state is that  if  <b>playlist-next</b>
              is  run  during  playback,  this  property  is  set to the playlist entry to play next (unlike the
              previous case). There is an internal flag that decides whether the current playlist entry  or  the
              next  one  should  be played, and this flag is currently inaccessible for API users. (Whether this
              behavior will kept is possibly subject to change.)

       <b>playlist-playing-pos</b>
              Index of the "playing" item on playlist. A playlist  item  is  "playing"  if  it's  being  loaded,
              actually  playing,  or  being  unloaded.  This  property  is  set  during the <b>MPV_EVENT_START_FILE</b>
              (<b>start-file</b>) and the <b>MPV_EVENT_START_END</b> (<b>end-file</b>) events. Outside of that, it returns -1. If the
              playlist entry was somehow removed during playback, but playback hasn't  stopped  yet,  or  is  in
              progress  of  being  stopped,  it  also  returns  -1.   (This  can  happen  at  least during state
              transitions.)

              In the "playing" state, this is usually the same as <b>playlist-pos</b>, except during state changes,  or
              if <b>playlist-current-pos</b> was written explicitly.

       <b>playlist-count</b>
              Number of total playlist entries.

       <b>playlist-path</b>
              The  original  path  of  the  playlist  for  the  current  entry  before mpv expanded the entries.
              Unavailable if the file was not originally associated with a playlist in some way.

       <b>playlist</b>
              Playlist, current entry marked. Currently, the raw property value is useless.

              This has a number of sub-properties. Replace <b>N</b> with the 0-based playlist entry index.

              <b>playlist/count</b>
                     Number of playlist entries (same as <b>playlist-count</b>).

              <b>playlist/N/filename</b>
                     Filename of the Nth entry.

              <b>playlist/N/playing</b>
                     <b>yes</b>/true if the <b>playlist-playing-pos</b> property points to this entry, <b>no</b>/false or unavailable
                     otherwise.

              <b>playlist/N/current</b>
                     <b>yes</b>/true if the <b>playlist-current-pos</b> property points to this entry, <b>no</b>/false or unavailable
                     otherwise.

              <b>playlist/N/title</b>
                     Name of the Nth entry. Available if the playlist file contains such fields and mpv's parser
                     supports it for the given playlist format, or if the playlist entry has been opened  before
                     and a media-title other than filename has been acquired.

              <b>playlist/N/id</b>
                     Unique  ID  for this entry. This is an automatically assigned integer ID that is unique for
                     the entire life time of the current mpv core instance. Other  commands,  events,  etc.  use
                     this as <b>playlist_entry_id</b> fields.

              <b>playlist/N/playlist-path</b>
                     The original path of the playlist for this entry before mpv expanded it. Unavailable if the
                     file was not originally associated with a playlist in some way.

              When   querying   the   property   with   the  client  API  using  <b>MPV_FORMAT_NODE</b>,  or  with  Lua
              <b>mp.get_property_native</b>, this will return a mpv_node with the following contents:

                 MPV_FORMAT_NODE_ARRAY
                     MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP (for each playlist entry)
                         "filename"  MPV_FORMAT_STRING
                         "current"   MPV_FORMAT_FLAG (might be missing; since mpv 0.7.0)
                         "playing"   MPV_FORMAT_FLAG (same)
                         "title"     MPV_FORMAT_STRING (optional)
                         "id"        MPV_FORMAT_INT64

       <b>track-list</b>
              List of audio/video/sub tracks, current entry marked.

              This has a number of sub-properties. Replace <b>N</b> with the 0-based track index.

              <b>track-list/count</b>
                     Total number of tracks.

              <b>track-list/video</b>
                     The list of video tracks. This  is  only  usable  for  printing  and  its  value  can't  be
                     retrieved.

              <b>track-list/audio</b>
                     The  list  of  audio  tracks.  This  is  only  usable  for  printing and its value can't be
                     retrieved.

              <b>track-list/sub</b>
                     The list of sub tracks. This is only usable for printing and its value can't be retrieved.

              <b>track-list/N/id</b>
                     The ID as it's used for <b>--sid</b>/<b>--aid</b>/<b>--vid</b>. This is unique within tracks of  the  same  type
                     (sub/audio/video), but otherwise not.

              <b>track-list/N/type</b>
                     String describing the media type. One of <b>audio</b>, <b>video</b>, <b>sub</b>.

              <b>track-list/N/src-id</b>
                     Track ID as used in the source file. Not always available. (It is missing if the format has
                     no  native ID, if the track is a pseudo-track that does not exist in this way in the actual
                     file, or if the format is handled by libavformat, and the format  was  not  whitelisted  as
                     having track IDs.)

              <b>track-list/N/title</b>
                     Track title as it is stored in the file. Not always available.

              <b>track-list/N/lang</b>
                     Track language as identified by the file. Not always available.

              <b>track-list/N/image</b>
                     <b>yes</b>/true  if  this  is  a  video  track  that  consists  of  a  single picture, <b>no</b>/false or
                     unavailable otherwise. The heuristic used to determine if a  stream  is  an  image  doesn't
                     attempt to detect images in codecs normally used for videos. Otherwise, it is reliable.

              <b>track-list/N/albumart</b>
                     <b>yes</b>/true  if  this is an image embedded in an audio file or external cover art, <b>no</b>/false or
                     unavailable otherwise.

              <b>track-list/N/default</b>
                     <b>yes</b>/true if the track has the default  flag  set  in  the  file,  <b>no</b>/false  or  unavailable
                     otherwise.

              <b>track-list/N/forced</b>
                     <b>yes</b>/true  if  the  track  has  the  forced  flag  set  in the file, <b>no</b>/false or unavailable
                     otherwise.

              <b>track-list/N/dependent</b>
                     <b>yes</b>/true if the track has the dependent flag set  in  the  file,  <b>no</b>/false  or  unavailable
                     otherwise.

              <b>track-list/N/visual-impaired</b>
                     <b>yes</b>/true if the track has the visual impaired flag set in the file, <b>no</b>/false or unavailable
                     otherwise.

              <b>track-list/N/hearing-impaired</b>
                     <b>yes</b>/true  if  the  track  has  the  hearing  impaired  flag  set  in  the file, <b>no</b>/false or
                     unavailable otherwise.

              <b>track-list/N/hls-bitrate</b>
                     The bitrate of the HLS stream, if available.

              <b>track-list/N/program-id</b>
                     The program ID of the HLS stream, if available.

              <b>track-list/N/codec</b>
                     The codec name used by this track, for example <b>h264</b>. Unavailable in some rare cases.

              <b>track-list/N/codec-desc</b>
                     The codec descriptive name used by this track.

              <b>track-list/N/codec-profile</b>
                     The codec profile used by this track. Available only if the track has been already decoded.

              <b>track-list/N/external</b>
                     <b>yes</b>/true if the track is an external file, <b>no</b>/false or unavailable otherwise. This  is  set
                     for separate subtitle files.

              <b>track-list/N/external-filename</b>
                     The filename if the track is from an external file, unavailable otherwise.

              <b>track-list/N/selected</b>
                     <b>yes</b>/true if the track is currently decoded, <b>no</b>/false or unavailable otherwise.

              <b>track-list/N/main-selection</b>
                     It  indicates the selection order of tracks for the same type.  If a track is not selected,
                     or is selected by the  <b>--lavfi-complex</b>,  it  is  not  available.  For  subtitle  tracks,  <b>0</b>
                     represents the <b>sid</b>, and <b>1</b> represents the <b>secondary-sid</b>.

              <b>track-list/N/ff-index</b>
                     The stream index as usually used by the FFmpeg utilities. Note that this can be potentially
                     wrong  if  a  demuxer  other  than libavformat (<b>--demuxer=lavf</b>) is used. For mkv files, the
                     index will usually match even if the default (builtin) demuxer is used,  but  there  is  no
                     hard guarantee.

              <b>track-list/N/decoder</b>

                     particular, the track could be decoded as a different number of channels.)

              <b>track-list/N/demux-channels</b>
                     Channel layout as indicated by the container. (Not always accurate.)

              <b>track-list/N/format-name</b>
                     Short name for format from ffmpeg. If the track is audio, this will  be  the  name  of  the
                     sample format. If the track is video, this will be the name of the pixel format.

              <b>track-list/N/audio-channels</b> <b>(deprecated)</b>

                     per-album values will be copied from the per-track values  currently.  It's  possible  that
                     future mpv versions will make these properties unavailable instead in this case.

              <b>track-list/N/dolby-vision-profile,</b> <b>track-list/N/dolby-vision-level</b>
                     Dolby Vision profile and level. May not be available if the container does not provide this
                     information.

              <b>track-list/N/metadata,</b>
                     Works  like  the  <b>metadata</b>  property, but it accesses metadata that is set per track/stream

       <b>current-tracks/...</b>
              This gives access to currently selected tracks. It redirects to the correct entry in <b>track-list</b>.

              The following sub-entries are defined: <b>video</b>, <b>audio</b>, <b>sub</b>, <b>sub2</b>

              For  example, <b>current-tracks/audio/lang</b> returns the current audio track's language field (the same
              value as <b>track-list/N/lang</b>).

              If tracks of the requested type are selected via <b>--lavfi-complex</b>, the first one is returned.

       <b>chapter-list</b> <b>(RW)</b>
              List of chapters, current entry marked.

              This has a number of sub-properties. Replace <b>N</b> with the 0-based chapter index.

              <b>chapter-list/count</b>
                     Number of chapters.

              <b>chapter-list/N/title</b>
                     Chapter title as stored in the file. Not always available.

              <b>chapter-list/N/time</b>
                     Chapter start time in seconds as float.

              When  querying  the  property  with  the  client  API   using   <b>MPV_FORMAT_NODE</b>,   or   with   Lua
              <b>mp.get_property_native</b>, this will return a mpv_node with the following contents:

                 MPV_FORMAT_NODE_ARRAY
                     MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP (for each chapter)
                         "title" MPV_FORMAT_STRING
                         "time"  MPV_FORMAT_DOUBLE

       <b>af,</b> <b>vf</b> <b>(RW)</b>
              See <b>--vf</b>/<b>--af</b> and the <b>vf</b>/<b>af</b> command.

              When   querying   the   property   with   the  client  API  using  <b>MPV_FORMAT_NODE</b>,  or  with  Lua
              <b>mp.get_property_native</b>, this will return a mpv_node with the following contents:

                 MPV_FORMAT_NODE_ARRAY
                     MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP (for each filter entry)
                         "name"      MPV_FORMAT_STRING
                         "label"     MPV_FORMAT_STRING [optional]
                         "enabled"   MPV_FORMAT_FLAG [optional]
                         "params"    MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP [optional]
                             "key"   MPV_FORMAT_STRING
                             "value" MPV_FORMAT_STRING

              It's also possible to write the property using this format.

       <b>seekable</b>
              Whether it's generally possible to seek in the current file.

       <b>partially-seekable</b>
              Whether the current file is considered seekable, but only because the cache is active. This  means
              small relative seeks may be fine, but larger seeks may fail anyway. Whether a seek will succeed or
              not is generally not known in advance.

              If this property returns <b>yes</b>/true, so will <b>seekable</b>.

       <b>playback-abort</b>
              Whether playback is stopped or is to be stopped. (Useful in obscure situations like during <b>on_load</b>
              hook  processing,  when  the  user  can  stop  playback,  but  the  script  has  to explicitly end
              processing.)

       <b>cursor-autohide</b> <b>(RW)</b>
              See <b>--cursor-autohide</b>. Setting this to a new value will always update the cursor,  and  reset  the
              internal timer.

       <b>term-clip-cc</b>
              Inserts  the  symbol to force line truncation to the current terminal width.  This can be used for
              <b>show-text</b> and other OSD messages. It must be the first character in  the  line.  It  takes  effect
              until the end of the line.

       <b>osd-sym-cc</b>
              Inserts  the  current  OSD  symbol as opaque OSD control code (cc). This makes sense only with the
              <b>show-text</b> command or options which set OSD messages.  The control code is implementation  specific
              and is useless for anything else.

       <b>osd-ass-cc</b>
              <b>${osd-ass-cc/0}</b>  disables escaping ASS sequences of text in OSD, <b>${osd-ass-cc/1}</b> enables it again.
              By default, ASS sequences are escaped to  avoid  accidental  formatting,  and  this  property  can
              disable  this  behavior.  Note  that  the properties return an opaque OSD control code, which only
              makes sense for the <b>show-text</b> command or options which set OSD messages.

                 Example

                 • <b>--osd-msg3='This</b> <b>is</b> <b>${osd-ass-cc/0}{\\b1}bold</b> <b>text'</b>

                 • <b>show-text</b> <b>"This</b> <b>is</b> <b>${osd-ass-cc/0}{\\b1}bold</b> <b>text"</b>

              Any ASS override tags as understood by libass can be used.

              Note that you need to escape the <b>\</b> character,  because  the  string  is  processed  for  C  escape
              sequences before passing it to the OSD code. See Flat command syntax for details.

              A list of tags can be found here:
               &lt;https://aegisub.org/docs/latest/ass_tags/&gt;

       <b>vo-configured</b>
              Whether  the  VO  is configured right now. Usually this corresponds to whether the video window is
              visible. If the <b>--force-window</b> option is used, this usually always returns <b>yes</b>/true.

       <b>vo-passes</b>
              Contains introspection about the  VO's  active  render  passes  and  their  execution  times.  Not
              implemented by all VOs.

              This  is  further subdivided into two frame types, <b>vo-passes/fresh</b> for fresh frames (which have to
              be uploaded, scaled, etc.) and  <b>vo-passes/redraw</b>  for  redrawn  frames  (which  only  have  to  be
              re-painted).   The  number  of  passes  for  any given subtype can change from frame to frame, and
              should not be relied upon.

              Each frame type has a number of further sub-properties. Replace <b>TYPE</b> with the frame type,  <b>N</b>  with
              the 0-based pass index, and <b>M</b> with the 0-based sample index.

              <b>vo-passes/TYPE/count</b>
                     Number of passes.

              <b>vo-passes/TYPE/N/desc</b>
                     Human-friendy description of the pass.

              <b>vo-passes/TYPE/N/last</b>
                     Last measured execution time, in nanoseconds.

              <b>vo-passes/TYPE/N/avg</b>
                     Average  execution  time  of  this pass, in nanoseconds. The exact timeframe varies, but it
                     should generally be a handful of seconds.

              <b>vo-passes/TYPE/N/peak</b>
                     The peak execution time (highest value) within this averaging range, in nanoseconds.

              <b>vo-passes/TYPE/N/count</b>
                     The number of samples for this pass.

              <b>vo-passes/TYPE/N/samples/M</b>
                     The raw execution time of a specific sample for this pass, in nanoseconds.

              When  querying  the  property  with  the  client  API   using   <b>MPV_FORMAT_NODE</b>,   or   with   Lua
              <b>mp.get_property_native</b>, this will return a mpv_node with the following contents:

                 MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP
                 "TYPE" MPV_FORMAT_NODE_ARRAY
                     MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP
                         "desc"    MPV_FORMAT_STRING
                         "last"    MPV_FORMAT_INT64
                         "avg"     MPV_FORMAT_INT64
                         "peak"    MPV_FORMAT_INT64
                         "count"   MPV_FORMAT_INT64
                         "samples" MPV_FORMAT_NODE_ARRAY
                              MP_FORMAT_INT64

              Note  that  directly  accessing  this  structure  via subkeys is not supported, the only access is
              through aforementioned <b>MPV_FORMAT_NODE</b>.

       <b>perf-info</b>
              Further performance data. Querying this property triggers internal collection of  some  data,  and
              may  slow down the player. Each query will reset some internal state. Property change notification
              doesn't and won't work.  All of this may change in the future, so  don't  use  this.  The  builtin
              <b>stats</b>  script  is supposed to be the only user; since it's bundled and built with the source code,
              it can use knowledge of mpv  internal  to  render  the  information  properly.  See  <b>stats</b>  script
              description for some details.

       <b>video-bitrate,</b> <b>audio-bitrate,</b> <b>sub-bitrate</b>
              Bitrate  values calculated on the packet level. This works by dividing the bit size of all packets
              between two keyframes by their presentation timestamp distance.  (This  uses  the  timestamps  are
              stored in the file, so e.g. playback speed does not influence the returned values.) In particular,
              the video bitrate will update only per keyframe, and show the "past" bitrate. To make the property
              more UI friendly, updates to these properties are throttled in a certain way.

              The  unit  is  bits  per  second.  OSD  formatting turns these values in kilobits (or megabits, if
              appropriate), which can be prevented by using the raw property value, e.g. with <b>${=video-bitrate}</b>.

              Note that the accuracy of these properties is influenced by a  few  factors.   If  the  underlying
              demuxer  rewrites  the  packets  on  demuxing  (done  for some file formats), the bitrate might be
              slightly off. If timestamps are bad or jittery (like in Matroska), even constant  bitrate  streams
              might show fluctuating bitrate.

              How exactly these values are calculated might change in the future.

              In  earlier versions of mpv, these properties returned a static (but bad) guess using a completely
              different method.

       <b>audio-device-list</b>
              The list of discovered audio devices. This is mostly for use with the  client  API,  and  reflects
              what <b>--audio-device=help</b> with the command line player returns.

              When   querying   the   property   with   the  client  API  using  <b>MPV_FORMAT_NODE</b>,  or  with  Lua
              <b>mp.get_property_native</b>, this will return a mpv_node with the following contents:

                 MPV_FORMAT_NODE_ARRAY
                     MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP (for each device entry)
                         "name"          MPV_FORMAT_STRING
                         "description"   MPV_FORMAT_STRING

              The <b>name</b> is what is to be passed to the <b>--audio-device</b> option (and often a  rather  cryptic  audio
              API-specific  ID),  while  <b>description</b> is human readable free form text. The description is set to
              the device name (minus mpv-specific <b>&lt;driver&gt;/</b> prefix)  if  no  description  is  available  or  the
              description would have been an empty string.

              The  special  entry  with  the  name  set  to <b>auto</b> selects the default audio output driver and the
              default device.

              The property can be watched with the property observation mechanism in the client API and  in  Lua
              scripts. (Technically, change notification is enabled the first time this property is read.)

       <b>audio-device</b> <b>(RW)</b>
              Set the audio device. This directly reads/writes the <b>--audio-device</b> option, but on write accesses,
              the audio output will be scheduled for reloading.

              Writing  this  property while no audio output is active will not automatically enable audio. (This
              is also true in the case when audio was disabled due to reinitialization failure after a  previous
              write access to <b>audio-device</b>.)

              This property also doesn't tell you which audio device is actually in use.

              How these details are handled may change in the future.

       <b>current-vo</b>
              Current video output driver (name as used with <b>--vo</b>).

       <b>current-gpu-context</b>
              Current  GPU context of video output driver (name as used with <b>--gpu-context</b>).  Valid for <b>--vo=gpu</b>
              and <b>--vo=gpu-next</b>.

       <b>current-ao</b>
              Current audio output driver (name as used with <b>--ao</b>).

       <b>user-data</b> <b>(RW)</b>
              This is a recursive key/value map of arbitrary nodes shared between clients for general use  (i.e.
              scripts,  IPC  clients,  host  applications,  etc).  The player itself does not use any data in it
              (although some builtin scripts may).  The property is not preserved across player restarts.

              Sub-paths can be accessed directly; e.g. <b>user-data/my-script/state/a</b>  can  be  read,  written,  or
              observed.

              The top-level object itself cannot be written directly; write to sub-paths instead.

              Converting  this  property  or  its  sub-properties to strings will give a JSON representation. If
              converting a leaf-level object (i.e. not a map or array) and not using raw  mode,  the  underlying
              content   will  be  given  (e.g.  strings  will  be  printed  directly,  rather  than  quoted  and
              JSON-escaped).

              The following sub-paths are reserved for internal uses or have special  semantics:  <b>user-data/osc</b>,
              <b>user-data/mpv</b>.  Unless  noted otherwise, the semantics of any properties under these sub-paths can
              change at any time and may not be relied upon, and writing to these properties may prevent builtin
              scripts from working properly.

              Currently, the following properties have defined special semantics:

              <b>user-data/osc/margins</b>
                     This property is written by an OSC implementation to indicate the margins that it occupies.
                     Its sub-properties <b>l</b>, <b>r</b>, <b>t</b>, and <b>b</b> should all be set to the left,  right,  top,  and  bottom
                     margins respectively.  Values are between 0.0 and 1.0, normalized to window width/height.

              <b>user-data/mpv/ytdl</b>
                     Data shared by the builtin ytdl hook script.

                     <b>user-data/mpv/ytdl/path</b>
                            Path  to  the ytdl executable, if found, or an empty string otherwise.  The property
                            is not set until the script attempts to find the ytdl executable, i.e. until an  URL
                            is being loaded by the script.

                     <b>user-data/mpv/ytdl/json-subprocess-result</b>
                            Result  of  executing  ytdl  to  retrieve the JSON data of the URL being loaded. The
                            format is the same as <b>subprocess</b>'s result, capturing stdout and stderr.

              <b>user-data/mpv/console/open</b>
                     Whether the console is open.

       <b>menu-data</b> <b>(RW)</b>
              This property stores the raw menu definition. See Context Menu section for details.

              <b>type</b>   Menu item type. Can be: <b>separator</b>, <b>submenu</b>, or empty.

              <b>title</b>  Menu item title. Required if type is not <b>separator</b>.

              <b>cmd</b>    Command to execute when the menu item is clicked.

              <b>shortcut</b>
                     Menu item shortcut key which appears to the right of the menu item.  A  shortcut  key  does
                     not have to be functional; it's just a visual hint.

              <b>state</b>  Menu item state. Can be: <b>checked</b>, <b>disabled</b>, <b>hidden</b>, or empty.

              <b>submenu</b>
                     Submenu items, which is required if type is <b>submenu</b>.

              When   querying   the   property   with   the  client  API  using  <b>MPV_FORMAT_NODE</b>,  or  with  Lua
              <b>mp.get_property_native</b>, this will return a mpv_node with the following contents:

                 MPV_FORMAT_NODE_ARRAY
                     MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP (menu item)
                         "type"           MPV_FORMAT_STRING
                         "title"          MPV_FORMAT_STRING
                         "cmd"            MPV_FORMAT_STRING
                         "shortcut"       MPV_FORMAT_STRING
                         "state"          MPV_FORMAT_NODE_ARRAY[MPV_FORMAT_STRING]
                         "submenu"        MPV_FORMAT_NODE_ARRAY[menu item]

              Writing  to  this  property  with   the   client   API   using   <b>MPV_FORMAT_NODE</b>   or   with   Lua
              <b>mp.set_property_native</b>  will  trigger  an  immediate  update  of  the  menu if mpv video output is
              currently active. You may observe the <b>current-vo</b> property to check if this is the case.

       <b>working-directory</b>
              The working directory of the mpv process. Can be useful for JSON IPC users,  because  the  command
              line player usually works with relative paths.

       <b>current-watch-later-dir</b>
              The directory in which watch later config files are stored. This returns <b>--watch-later-dir</b>, or the
              default directory if <b>--watch-later-dir</b> has not been modified, with tilde placeholders expanded.

       <b>protocol-list</b>
              List of protocol prefixes potentially recognized by the player. They are returned without trailing
              <b>://</b>  suffix  (which  is  still always required).  In some cases, the protocol will not actually be
              supported (consider <b>https</b> if ffmpeg is not compiled with TLS support).

       <b>decoder-list</b>
              List of decoders supported. This lists decoders which can be passed to <b>--vd</b> and <b>--ad</b>.

              <b>codec</b>  Canonical codec name, which identifies the format the decoder can handle.

              <b>driver</b> The name of the decoder itself. Often, this is the same as  <b>codec</b>.   Sometimes  it  can  be
                     different. It is used to distinguish multiple decoders for the same codec.

              <b>description</b>
                     Human readable description of the decoder and codec.

              When   querying   the   property   with   the  client  API  using  <b>MPV_FORMAT_NODE</b>,  or  with  Lua
              <b>mp.get_property_native</b>, this will return a mpv_node with the following contents:

                 MPV_FORMAT_NODE_ARRAY
                     MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP (for each decoder entry)
                         "codec"         MPV_FORMAT_STRING
                         "driver"        MPV_FORMAT_STRING
                         "description"   MPV_FORMAT_STRING

       <b>encoder-list</b>
              List of libavcodec encoders. This has the same format as <b>decoder-list</b>.  The encoder names  (<b>driver</b>
              entries) can be passed to <b>--ovc</b> and <b>--oac</b> (without the <b>lavc:</b> prefix required by <b>--vd</b> and <b>--ad</b>).

       <b>demuxer-lavf-list</b>
              List  of  available  libavformat  demuxers'  names.  This  can  be used to check for support for a
              specific format or use with <b>--demuxer-lavf-format</b>.

       <b>input-key-list</b>
              List of Key names, same as output by <b>--input-keylist</b>.

       <b>mpv-version</b>
              The mpv version/copyright string. Depending on how the binary was built, it might contain either a
              release version, or just a git hash.

       <b>mpv-configuration</b>
              The configuration arguments that were passed to the build system. If the  meson  version  used  to
              compile  mpv is older than 1.1.0, then a hardcoded string of a few, arbitrary options is displayed
              instead.

       <b>ffmpeg-version</b>
              The contents of the <b>av_version_info()</b> API call. This is a string which  identifies  the  build  in
              some  way, either through a release version number, or a git hash. This property is unavailable if
              mpv is linked against older FFmpeg versions.

       <b>libass-version</b>
              The value of <b>ass_library_version()</b>.  This  is  an  integer,  encoded  in  a  somewhat  weird  form
              (apparently "hex BCD"), indicating the release version of the libass library linked to mpv.

       <b>platform</b>
              Returns a string describing what target platform mpv was built for. The value of this is dependent
              on  what  the underlying build system detects. Some of the most common values are: <b>windows</b>, <b>darwin</b>
              (macos or ios), <b>linux</b>, <b>android</b>, and <b>freebsd</b>. Note that this is not a complete listing.

       <b>options/&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>(RW)</b>
              The value of option <b>--&lt;name&gt;</b>. Most options can be changed at runtime by writing to this  property.
              Note  that  many  options  require  reloading  the file for changes to take effect. If there is an
              equivalent property, prefer setting the property instead.

              There shouldn't be any reason to access <b>options/&lt;name&gt;</b> instead of <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>, except in situations  in
              which the properties have different behavior or conflicting semantics.

       <b>file-local-options/&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>(RW)</b>
              Similar  to  <b>options/&lt;name&gt;</b>, but when setting an option through this property, the option is reset
              to its old value once the current file has stopped playing. Trying to write  an  option  while  no
              file is playing (or is being loaded) results in an error.

              (Note  that  if  an option is marked as file-local, even <b>options/</b> will access the local value, and
              the <b>old</b> value, which will be restored on end of playback, cannot be read or written until  end  of
              playback.)

       <b>option-info/&lt;name&gt;</b>
              Additional per-option information.

              This  has  a  number  of  sub-properties.  Replace  <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> with the name of a top-level option. No
              guarantee of stability is given to any of these sub-properties - they may change radically in  the
              future.

              <b>option-info/&lt;name&gt;/name</b>
                     The name of the option.

              <b>option-info/&lt;name&gt;/type</b>
                     The  name  of  the  option type, like <b>String</b> or <b>Integer</b>. For many complex types, this isn't
                     very accurate.

              <b>option-info/&lt;name&gt;/set-from-commandline</b>
                     Whether the option was set from the mpv command line. What this is set to if the option  is
                     e.g. changed at runtime is left undefined (meaning it could change in the future).

              <b>option-info/&lt;name&gt;/set-locally</b>
                     Whether  the  option was set per-file. This is the case with automatically loaded profiles,
                     file-dir configs, and other cases. It means the option value will be restored to the  value
                     before playback start when playback ends.

              <b>option-info/&lt;name&gt;/expects-file</b>
                     Whether the option takes file paths as arguments.

              <b>option-info/&lt;name&gt;/default-value</b>
                     The default value of the option. May not always be available.

              <b>option-info/&lt;name&gt;/min,</b> <b>option-info/&lt;name&gt;/max</b>
                     Integer  minimum  and  maximum values allowed for the option. Only available if the options
                     are numeric, and the minimum/maximum has been set internally. It's also possible that  only
                     one of these is set.

              <b>option-info/&lt;name&gt;/choices</b>
                     If  the  option  is a choice option, the possible choices. Choices that are integers may or
                     may not be included (they can be implied by <b>min</b> and <b>max</b>). Note that  options  which  behave
                     like  choice  options, but are not actual choice options internally, may not have this info
                     available.

       <b>property-list</b>
              The list of top-level properties.

       <b>profile-list</b>
              The list of profiles and their contents. This is highly implementation-specific,  and  may  change
              any time. Currently, it returns an array of options for each profile. Each option has a name and a
              value,  with  the value currently always being a string. Note that the options array is not a map,
              as order matters and duplicate entries are possible. Recursive profiles are not expanded, and show
              up as special <b>profile</b> options.

              The <b>profile-restore</b> field is currently missing if it holds the default value  (either  because  it
              was not set, or set explicitly to <b>default</b>), but in the future it might hold the value <b>default</b>.

       <b>command-list</b>
              The  list  of  input  commands.  This  returns  an array of maps, where each map node represents a
              command. This map currently only has a single entry: <b>name</b> for  the  name  of  the  command.  (This
              property  is  supposed  to  be  a  replacement  for  <b>--input-cmdlist</b>.  The  option dumps some more
              information, but it's a valid feature request to extend this property if needed.)

       <b>input-bindings</b>
              The list of current input key bindings. This returns  an  array  of  maps,  where  each  map  node
              represents a binding for a single key/command. This map has the following entries:

              <b>key</b>    The  key name. This is normalized and may look slightly different from how it was specified
                     in the source (e.g. in input.conf).

              <b>cmd</b>    The command mapped to the key. (Currently, this is exactly the same string as specified  in
                     the  source,  other  than  stripping whitespace and comments. It's possible that it will be
                     normalized in the future.)

              <b>is_weak</b>
                     If set to true, any existing and active user bindings will take priority.

              <b>owner</b>  If this entry exists, the name of the script (or similar) which added this binding.

              <b>section</b>
                     Name of the section this binding is part of. This is a rarely used  mechanism.  This  entry
                     may be removed or change meaning in the future.

              <b>priority</b>
                     A  number.  Bindings with a higher value are preferred over bindings with a lower value. If
                     the value is negative, this binding is inactive and will not be triggered  by  input.  Note
                     that  mpv  does  not  use this value internally, and matching of bindings may work slightly
                     differently in some cases. In addition, this value is dynamic  and  can  change  around  at
                     runtime.

              <b>comment</b>
                     If  available,  the  comment  following  the  command  on  the same line. (For example, the
                     input.conf entry <b>f</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>bla</b> <b>#</b> <b>toggle</b> <b>bla</b> would result in an entry with <b>comment</b>  <b>=</b>  <b>"toggle</b>
                     <b>bla",</b> <b>cmd</b> <b>=</b> <b>"cycle</b> <b>bla"</b>.)

              This property is read-only, and change notification is not supported.

       <b>clipboard</b>
              The  clipboard contents, only works when native clipboard (<b>--clipboard-enable</b>) is supported on the
              platform.  Depending on the platform,  some  sub-properties,  writing  to  properties,  or  change
              notifications are not currently functional.

              This has a number of sub-properties:

              <b>clipboard/text</b> <b>(RW)</b>
                     The  text  content  in  the  clipboard  (Windows, Wayland and macOS only).  Writing to this
                     property sets the text clipboard content (Windows only).

              <b>clipboard/text-primary</b>
                     The text content in the primary selection (Wayland only).

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 On Wayland with the <b>vo</b> clipboard backend, the  clipboard  content  is  only  updated  when  the
                 compositor  sends  a  selection  data  offer (typically when VO window is focused). The <b>wayland</b>
                 backend typically does not have this limitation.  See  <b>current-clipboard-backend</b>  property  for
                 more details.

       <b>current-clipboard-backend</b>
              A  string  containing the currently active clipboard backend.  See <b>--clipboard-backends</b> option for
              the list of available backends.

       <b>clock</b>  The current local time in hour:minutes format.

   <b>Inconsistencies</b> <b>between</b> <b>options</b> <b>and</b> <b>properties</b>
       You can access (almost) all options as properties, though there are some  caveats  with  some  properties
       (due to historical reasons):

       <b>vid,</b> <b>aid,</b> <b>sid</b>
              While  playback is active, these return the actually active tracks. For example, if you set <b>aid=5</b>,
              and the currently played file contains no audio track with ID 5, the <b>aid</b> property will return <b>no</b>.

              Before mpv 0.31.0, you could set existing tracks at runtime only.

       <b>display-fps</b>
              This inconsistent behavior is deprecated. Post-deprecation, the  reported  value  and  the  option
              value are cleanly separated (<b>override-display-fps</b> for the option value).

       <b>vf,</b> <b>af</b> If  you set the properties during playback, and the filter chain fails to reinitialize, the option
              will be set, but the runtime filter chain does not change. On the other hand, the next video to be
              played will fail, because the initial filter chain cannot be created.

              This behavior changed in mpv 0.31.0. Before this, the new value was rejected <u>iff</u> a video (for  <b>vf</b>)
              or  an  audio  (for <b>af</b>) track was active. If playback was not active, the behavior was the same as
              the current one.

       <b>playlist</b>
              The property is read-only and returns the current internal playlist. The  option  is  for  loading
              playlist  during  command  line  parsing. For client API uses, you should use the <b>loadlist</b> command
              instead.

       <b>profile,</b> <b>include</b>
              These are write-only, and will perform actions as they are written to, exactly  as  if  they  were
              used  on  the  mpv  CLI  commandline. Their only use is when using libmpv before <b>mpv_initialize()</b>,
              which in turn is probably only useful in encoding mode.  Normal  libmpv  users  should  use  other
              mechanisms,  such  as  the <b>apply-profile</b> command, and the <b>mpv_load_config_file</b> API function. Avoid
              these properties.

   <b>Property</b> <b>Expansion</b>
       All string arguments to input commands as well as certain options (like <b>--term-playing-msg</b>)  are  subject
       to property expansion. Note that property expansion does not work in places where e.g. numeric parameters
       are  expected.   (For  example,  the  <b>add</b>  command  does not do property expansion. The <b>set</b> command is an
       exception and not a general rule.)

          Example for input.conf

          <b>i</b> <b>show-text</b> <b>"Filename:</b> <b>${filename}"</b>
                 shows the filename of the current file when pressing the <b>i</b> key

       Whether property expansion is enabled by default depends on which API is used (see Flat  command  syntax,
       Commands   specified   as   arrays  and  Named  arguments),  but  it  can  always  be  enabled  with  the
       <b>expand-properties</b> prefix or disabled with the <b>raw</b> prefix, as described in Input Command Prefixes.

       The following expansions are supported:

       <b>${NAME}</b>
              Expands to the value of the property <b>NAME</b>. If retrieving the property fails, expand  to  an  error
              string.  (Use  <b>${NAME:}</b>  with  a  trailing  <b>:</b>  to  expand to an empty string instead.)  If <b>NAME</b> is
              prefixed with <b>=</b>, expand to the raw value of the property (see section below).

       <b>${NAME:STR}</b>
              Expands to the value of the property <b>NAME</b>, or <b>STR</b> if the property  cannot  be  retrieved.  <b>STR</b>  is
              expanded recursively.

       <b>${?NAME:STR}</b>
              Expands to <b>STR</b> (recursively) if the property <b>NAME</b> is available.

       <b>${!NAME:STR}</b>
              Expands to <b>STR</b> (recursively) if the property <b>NAME</b> cannot be retrieved.

       <b>${?NAME==VALUE:STR}</b>
              Expands  to  <b>STR</b>  (recursively)  if  the property <b>NAME</b> expands to a string equal to <b>VALUE</b>. You can
              prefix <b>NAME</b> with <b>=</b> in order to compare the raw value of a property (see  section  below).  If  the
              property  is unavailable, or other errors happen when retrieving it, the value is never considered
              equal.  Note that <b>VALUE</b> can't contain any of the characters <b>:</b> or <b>}</b>.  Also,  it  is  possible  that
              escaping with <b>"</b> or <b>%</b> might be added in the future, should the need arise.

       <b>${!NAME==VALUE:STR}</b>
              Same  as  with  the  <b>?</b>  variant,  but  <b>STR</b>  is expanded if the value is not equal. (Using the same
              semantics as with <b>?</b>.)

       <b>$$</b>     Expands to <b>$</b>.

       <b>$}</b>     Expands to <b>}</b>. (To produce this character inside recursive expansion.)

       <b>$&gt;</b>     Disable property expansion and special handling of <b>$</b> for the rest of the string.

       In places where property expansion is allowed, C-style escapes are often accepted as well. Example:

          • <b>\n</b> becomes a newline character

          • <b>\\</b> expands to <b>\</b>

   <b>Raw</b> <b>and</b> <b>Formatted</b> <b>Properties</b>
       Normally, properties are formatted as human-readable text, meant  to  be  displayed  on  OSD  or  on  the
       terminal.  It  is  possible  to retrieve an unformatted (raw) value from a property by prefixing its name
       with <b>=</b>. These raw values can be parsed by other programs and follow the same conventions as  the  options
       associated  with  the  properties.  Additionally, there is a <b>&gt;</b> prefix to format human-readable text, with
       fixed precision for floating-point values. This is useful for printing values where a constant  width  is
       important.

          Examples

          • <b>${time-pos}</b> expands to <b>00:14:23</b> (if playback position is at 14 minutes 23 seconds)

          • <b>${=time-pos}</b>  expands  to  <b>863.4</b>  (same  time, plus 400 milliseconds - milliseconds are normally not
            shown in the formatted case)

          • <b>${avsync}</b> expands to <b>+0.003</b>

          • <b>${&gt;avsync}</b> expands to <b>+0.0030</b>

          • <b>${=avsync}</b> expands to <b>0.003028</b>

       Sometimes, the difference in amount of information carried by raw and formatted property  values  can  be
       rather  big.  In  some  cases,  raw values have more information, like higher precision than seconds with
       <b>time-pos</b>. Sometimes it is the other way around, e.g. <b>aid</b> shows track title and language in the  formatted
       case, but only the track number if it is raw.

</pre><h4><b>ON</b> <b>SCREEN</b> <b>CONTROLLER</b></h4><pre>
       The   On  Screen  Controller  (short:  OSC)  is  a  minimal  GUI  integrated  with  mpv  to  offer  basic
       mouse-controllability. It is intended to make interaction easier for new users and to enable precise  and
       direct seeking.

       The OSC is enabled by default if mpv was compiled with Lua support. It can be disabled entirely using the
       <b>--osc=no</b> option.

   <b>Using</b> <b>the</b> <b>OSC</b>
       By  default,  the  OSC will show up whenever the mouse is moved inside the player window and will hide if
       the mouse is not moved outside the OSC for 0.5 seconds or if the mouse leaves the window.

       Since  mpv  0.40.0,  it is possible to configure the commands to run with mouse actions on some interface
       elements, and the default behaviors of several elements were changed. If you miss some  older  behaviors,
       look at <b>etc/restore-osc-bindings.conf</b> in the mpv git repository.

   <b>Key</b> <b>Bindings</b>
       These  key  bindings  are  active  by  default if nothing else is already bound to these keys. In case of
       collision, the function needs to be bound to a different key. See the Script Commands section.

   <b>Configuration</b>
       This  script  can be customized through a config file <b>script-opts/osc.conf</b> placed in mpv's user directory
       and through the <b>--script-opts</b> command-line option. The configuration syntax is  described  in  mp.options
       functions.

   <b>Command-line</b> <b>Syntax</b>
       To avoid collisions with other scripts, all options need to be prefixed with <b>osc-</b>.

       Example:

          --script-opts=osc-optionA=value1,osc-optionB=value2

   <b>Configurable</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>layout</b> Default: bottombar

              The  layout  for  the OSC. Currently available are: box, slimbox, bottombar, topbar, slimbottombar
              and slimtopbar. Default pre-0.21.0 was 'box'.

       <b>seekbarstyle</b>
              Default: bar

              Sets the style of the playback position marker and overall shape of the seekbar: <b>bar</b>,  <b>diamond</b>  or
              <b>knob</b>.

       <b>seekbarhandlesize</b>
              Default: 0.6

              Size  ratio  of the seek handle if <b>seekbarstyle</b> is set to <b>diamond</b> or <b>knob</b>. This is relative to the
              full height of the seekbar.

       <b>seekbarkeyframes</b>
              Default: yes

              Controls the mode used to seek when dragging the seekbar. If set to <b>yes</b>, default seeking  mode  is
              used (usually keyframes, but player defaults and heuristics can change it to exact). If set to <b>no</b>,
              exact seeking on mouse drags will be used instead. Keyframes are preferred, but exact seeks may be
              useful  in cases where keyframes cannot be found. Note that using exact seeks can potentially make
              mouse dragging much slower.

       <b>seekrangestyle</b>
              Default: inverted

              Display seekable ranges on the seekbar. <b>bar</b> shows them on the full height of the bar,  <b>line</b>  as  a
              thick  line and <b>inverted</b> as a thin line that is inverted over playback position markers. <b>none</b> will
              hide them. Additionally, <b>slider</b> will show a permanent handle inside the seekbar with cached ranges
              marked inside. Note that these will look differently  based  on  the  seekbarstyle  option.  Also,
              <b>slider</b> does not work with <b>seekbarstyle</b> set to <b>bar</b>.

       <b>seekrangeseparate</b>
              Default: yes

              Controls  whether  to  show  line-style  seekable  ranges  on  top of the seekbar or separately if
              <b>seekbarstyle</b> is set to <b>bar</b>.

       <b>seekrangealpha</b>
              Default: 20

              Alpha of the seekable ranges, 0 (opaque) to 255 (fully transparent).

       <b>scrollcontrols</b>
              Default: yes

              By default, going up or down with the mouse wheel can trigger certain actions (such as seeking) if
              the mouse is hovering an OSC element.  Set to <b>no</b> to disable any special mouse wheel behavior.

       <b>deadzonesize</b>
              Default: 0.5

              Size of the deadzone. The deadzone is an area that makes the mouse act like  leaving  the  window.
              Movement there won't make the OSC show up and it will hide immediately if the mouse enters it. The
              deadzone  starts  at  the  window border opposite to the OSC and the size controls how much of the
              window it will span. Values between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0 means the  OSC  will  always  popup  with
              mouse  movement  in  the  window,  and 1 means the OSC will only show up when the mouse hovers it.
              Default pre-0.21.0 was 0.

       <b>minmousemove</b>
              Default: 0

              Minimum amount of pixels the mouse has to move between ticks to make  the  OSC  show  up.  Default
              pre-0.21.0 was 3.

       <b>showwindowed</b>
              Default: yes

              Enable the OSC when windowed

       <b>showfullscreen</b>
              Default: yes

              Enable the OSC when fullscreen

       <b>idlescreen</b>
              Default: yes

              Show the mpv logo and message when idle

       <b>scalewindowed</b>
              Default: 1.0

              Scale factor of the OSC when windowed.

       <b>scalefullscreen</b>
              Default: 1.0

              Scale factor of the OSC when fullscreen

       <b>vidscale</b>
              Default: auto

              Scale  the  OSC with the video.  <b>no</b> tries to keep the OSC size constant as much as the window size
              allows.  <b>auto</b> scales the OSC with the OSD, which is scaled with the window or kept at  a  constant
              size, depending on the <b>--osd-scale-by-window</b> option.

       <b>valign</b> Default: 0.8

              Vertical alignment in box and slimbox layouts, -1 (top) to 1 (bottom).

       <b>halign</b> Default: 0.0

              Horizontal alignment in box and slimbox layouts, -1 (left) to 1 (right).

       <b>barmargin</b>
              Default: 0

              Margin from bottom (bottombar, slimbottombar) or top (topbar, slimtopbar), in pixels.

       <b>boxalpha</b>
              Default: 80

              Alpha of the background box, 0 (opaque) to 255 (fully transparent)

       <b>hidetimeout</b>
              Default: 500

              Duration in ms until the OSC hides if no mouse movement, must not be negative

       <b>fadeduration</b>
              Default: 200

              Duration of fade effects in ms, 0 = no fade.

       <b>fadein</b> Default: no

              Enable fade-in.

       <b>title</b>  Default: ${!playlist-count==1:[${playlist-pos-1}/${playlist-count}] }${media-title}

              String that supports property expansion that will be displayed as OSC title.  ASS tags are escaped
              and newlines are converted to spaces.

       <b>tooltipborder</b>
              Default: 1

              Size of the tooltip outline when using bottombar or topbar layouts

       <b>timetotal</b>
              Default: no

              Show total time instead of time remaining

       <b>remaining_playtime</b>
              Default: yes

              Whether the time-remaining display takes speed into account.  <b>yes</b> - how much playback time remains
              at the current speed.  <b>no</b> - how much video-time remains.

       <b>timems</b> Default: no

              Display timecodes with milliseconds

       <b>tcspace</b>
              Default: 100 (allowed: 50-200)

              Adjust  space reserved for timecodes (current time and time remaining) in the <b>bottombar</b> and <b>topbar</b>
              layouts. The timecode width depends on the  font,  and  with  some  fonts  the  spacing  near  the
              timecodes  becomes  too  small.   Use  values  above 100 to increase that spacing, or below 100 to
              decrease it.

       <b>visibility</b>
              Default: auto (auto hide/show on mouse move)

              Also supports <b>never</b> and <b>always</b>

       <b>visibility_modes</b>
              Default: never_auto_always

              The list of visibility modes to  cycle  through  when  calling  the  osc-visibility  cycle  script
              message. Modes are separated by <b>_</b>.

       <b>boxmaxchars</b>
              Default: 80

              Max  chars  for the osc title at the box layout. mpv does not measure the text width on screen and
              so it needs to limit it by number of chars. The default is conservative to allow wide fonts to  be
              used without overflow.  However, with many common fonts a bigger number can be used. YMMV.

       <b>boxvideo</b>
              Default: no

              Whether  to  overlay the osc over the video (<b>no</b>), or to box the video within the areas not covered
              by the osc (<b>yes</b>). If this option is set, the osc may overwrite the <b>--video-margin-ratio-*</b> options,
              even if the user has set them. (It will not overwrite them if all  of  them  are  set  to  default
              values.) Additionally, <b>visibility</b> must be set to <b>always</b>.  Otherwise, this option does nothing.

              Currently, this is supported for the <b>bottombar</b>, <b>slimbottombar</b>, <b>topbar</b> and <b>slimtopbar</b> layouts only.
              The  other layouts do not change if this option is set. Separately, if window controls are present
              (see below), they will be affected regardless of which osc layout is in use.

              The border is static and  appears  even  if  the  OSC  is  configured  to  appear  only  on  mouse
              interaction. If the OSC is invisible, the border is simply filled with the background color (black
              by default).

              This  currently still makes the OSC overlap with subtitles (if the <b>--sub-use-margins</b> option is set
              to <b>yes</b>, the default). This may be fixed later.

              This does not work correctly with video outputs like <b>--vo=xv</b>, which render OSD into  the  unscaled
              video.

       <b>windowcontrols</b>
              Default: auto (Show window controls if there is no window border)

              Whether  to show window management controls over the video, and if so, which side of the window to
              place them. This may be desirable when the window has no decorations,  either  because  they  have
              been  explicitly  disabled  (<b>border=no</b>)  or because the current platform doesn't support them (eg:
              gnome-shell with wayland).

              The set of window controls is fixed, offering <b>minimize</b>, <b>maximize</b>,  and  <b>quit</b>.  Not  all  platforms
              implement <b>minimize</b> and <b>maximize</b>, but <b>quit</b> will always work.

       <b>windowcontrols_alignment</b>
              Default: right

              If window controls are shown, indicates which side should they be aligned to.

              Supports <b>left</b> and <b>right</b> which will place the controls on those respective sides.

       <b>windowcontrols_title</b>
              Default: ${media-title}

              String  that  supports property expansion that will be displayed as the windowcontrols title.  ASS
              tags are escaped, and newlines and trailing slashes are stripped.

       <b>greenandgrumpy</b>
              Default: no

              Set to <b>yes</b> to reduce festivity (i.e. disable santa hat in December.)

       <b>livemarkers</b>
              Default: yes

              Update chapter markers positions  on  duration  changes,  e.g.  live  streams.   The  updates  are
              unoptimized - consider disabling it on very low-end systems.

       <b>chapter_fmt</b>
              Default: <b>Chapter:</b> <b>%s</b>

              Template  for  the  chapter-name  display  when  hovering  the seekbar.  Use <b>no</b> to disable chapter
              display on hover. Otherwise it's a lua <b>string.format</b> template and <b>%s</b> is replaced with  the  actual
              name.

       <b>unicodeminus</b>
              Default: no

              Use a Unicode minus sign instead of an ASCII hyphen when displaying the remaining playback time.

       <b>background_color</b>
              Default: #000000

              Sets the background color of the OSC.

       <b>timecode_color</b>
              Default: #FFFFFF

              Sets the color of the timecode and seekbar, of the OSC.

       <b>title_color</b>
              Default: #FFFFFF

              Sets the color of the video title. Formatted as #RRGGBB.

       <b>time_pos_color</b>
              Default: #FFFFFF

              Sets the color of the timecode at hover position in the seekbar.

       <b>time_pos_outline_color</b>
              Default: #FFFFFF

              Sets  the  color  of  the  timecode's  outline at hover position in the seekbar.  Also affects the
              timecode in the slimbox layout.

       <b>buttons_color</b>
              Default: #FFFFFF

              Sets the colors of the big buttons.

       <b>top_buttons_color</b>
              Default: #FFFFFF

              Sets the colors of the top buttons.

       <b>small_buttonsL_color</b>
              Default: #FFFFFF

              Sets the colors of the small buttons on the left in the box layout.

       <b>small_buttonsR_color</b>
              Default: #FFFFFF

              Sets the colors of the small buttons on the right in the box layout.

       <b>held_element_color</b>
              Default: #999999

              Sets the colors of the elements that are being pressed or held down.

       <b>tick_delay</b>
              Default: 1/60

              Sets the minimum interval between OSC redraws in seconds. This can be decreased on fast systems to
              make OSC rendering smoother.

              Ignored if <b>tick_delay_follow_display_fps</b> is set  to  yes  and  the  VO  supports  the  <b>display-fps</b>
              property.

       <b>tick_delay_follow_display_fps</b>
              Default: no

              Use display fps to calculate the interval between OSC redraws.

       The following options configure what commands are run when the buttons are clicked. <b>mbtn_mid</b> commands are
       also triggered with <b>shift+mbtn_left</b>.

   <b>Script</b> <b>Commands</b>
       The OSC script listens to certain script commands. These commands can bound in  <b>input.conf</b>,  or  sent  by
       other scripts.

       <b>osc-visibility</b>
              Controls visibility mode <b>never</b> / <b>auto</b> (on mouse move) / <b>always</b> and also <b>cycle</b> to cycle between the
              modes. If a second argument is passed (any value), then the output on the OSD will be silenced.

       <b>osc-show</b>
              Triggers the OSC to show up, just as if user moved mouse.

       <b>osc-hide</b>
              Hide the OSC when <b>visibility</b> is <b>auto</b>.

       Example

       You could put this into <b>input.conf</b> to hide the OSC with the <b>a</b> key and to set auto mode (the default) with
       <b>b</b>:

          a script-message osc-visibility never
          b script-message osc-visibility auto

       <b>osc-idlescreen</b>
              Controls  the visibility of the mpv logo on idle. Valid arguments are <b>yes</b>, <b>no</b>, and <b>cycle</b> to toggle
              between yes and no. If a second argument is passed (any value), then the output on the OSD will be
              silenced.

</pre><h4><b>STATS</b></h4><pre>
       This builtin script displays information and statistics for the currently played file. It is  enabled  by
       default   if   mpv   was   compiled   with   Lua   support.   It  can  be  disabled  entirely  using  the
       <b>--load-stats-overlay=no</b> option.

   <b>Usage</b>
       The following key bindings are active by default unless something else is already bound to them:
                                    ┌───┬───────────────────────────────────────┐

              text  and  graphs  with  the  OSD,  which  is  scaled  with the window or kept at a constant size,
              depending on the <b>--osd-scale-by-window</b> option.

       Note: colors are given as hexadecimal values and use ASS tag order: BBGGRR (blue green red).

   <b>Different</b> <b>key</b> <b>bindings</b>
       Additional keys can be configured in <b>input.conf</b> to display the stats:

          e script-binding stats/display-stats
          E script-binding stats/display-stats-toggle

       And to display a certain page directly:

          i script-binding stats/display-page-1
          h script-binding stats/display-page-4-toggle

   <b>Active</b> <b>key</b> <b>bindings</b> <b>page</b>
       Lists the active key bindings and the commands they're bound to, excluding the interactive  keys  of  the
       stats script itself. See also <b>--input-test</b> for more detailed view of each binding.

       The  keys  are  grouped  automatically  using a simple analysis of the command string, and one should not
       expect documentation-level grouping accuracy, however, it should still be reasonably useful.

       Using <b>--idle</b> <b>--script-opt=stats-bindlist=yes</b> will print the list to the terminal  and  quit  immediately.
       Long    lines    are    clipped    to    the    terminal    width    unless   this   is   disabled   with
       <b>--script-opt=stats-term_clip=no</b>.  Escape  sequences  can  be  disabled  by  adding  <b>-</b>  before  <b>yes</b>,  i.e.
       <b>--script-opt=stats-bindlist=-yes</b>.

       Like with <b>--input-test</b>, the list includes bindings from <b>input.conf</b> and from user scripts. Use <b>--no-config</b>
       to list only built-in bindings.

   <b>Internal</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>page</b>
       Most  entries  shown on this page have rather vague meaning. Likely none of this is useful for you. Don't
       attempt to use it. Forget its existence.

       Selecting this for the first time will start  collecting  some  internal  performance  data.  That  means
       performance  will  be  slightly lower than normal for the rest of the time the player is running (even if
       the stats page is closed).  Note that the stats page itself uses a lot of CPU and even GPU resources, and
       may have a heavy impact on performance.

       The displayed information is accumulated over the redraw delay (shown as <b>poll-time</b> field).

       This adds entries for each Lua script. If there are too many scripts running,  parts  of  the  list  will
       simply be out of the screen, but it can be scrolled.

       If  the  underlying  platform does not support pthread per thread times, the displayed times will be 0 or
       something random (I suspect that at time of this writing, only Linux provides  the  correct  via  pthread
       APIs for per thread times).

       Most  entries  are added lazily and only during data collection, which is why entries may pop up randomly
       after some time. It's also why the memory usage entries for scripts that have  been  inactive  since  the
       start of data collection are missing.

       Memory usage is approximate and does not reflect internal fragmentation.

       JS  scripts  memory  reporting  is  disabled by default because collecting the data at the JS side has an
       overhead and will increase memory usage. It can be  enabled  by  setting  the  <b>--js-memory-report</b>  option
       before starting mpv.

       If  entries  have  <b>/time</b>  and  <b>/cpu</b> variants, the former gives the real time (monotonic clock), while the
       latter the thread CPU time (only if the corresponding pthread API works and is supported).

</pre><h4><b>CONSOLE</b></h4><pre>
       This script provides the ability to process the  user's  textual  input  to  other  scripts  through  the
       <b>mp.input</b>  API. It can be displayed on both the video window and the terminal. It can be disabled entirely
       using the <b>--load-console=no</b> option.

       Console can either process free-form text or select from a predefined list of items.

   <b>Configuration</b>
       This  script  can  be  customized  through  a  config  file <b>script-opts/console.conf</b> placed in mpv's user
       directory and through the <b>--script-opts</b> command-line option. The configuration  syntax  is  described  in
       mp.options functions.

   <b>Configurable</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>font</b>   The font name.

              When  necessary  to align completions in a grid, a monospace font depending on the platform is the
              default. When there are no completions, <b>--osd-font</b> is the default.

       <b>font_size</b>
              Default: 24

              The font size. This will be multiplied by <b>display-hidpi-scale</b> when the console is not scaled  with
              the window.

       <b>border_size</b>

       <b>padding</b>
              Default: 10

              The padding of the menu.

       <b>menu_outline_size</b>

              The color of the menu's border.

       <b>corner_radius</b>
              Default: 8

              The radius of the menu's corners.

       <b>margin_x</b>
              Default: same as <b>--osd-margin-x</b>

              The margin from the left of the window.

       <b>margin_y</b>
              Default: same as <b>--osd-margin-y</b>

              The margin from the bottom of the window.

       <b>scale_with_window</b>
              Default: <b>auto</b>

              Whether  to  scale  the console with the window height. Can be <b>yes</b>, <b>no</b>, or <b>auto</b>, which follows the
              value of <b>--osd-scale-by-window</b>.

              Remove duplicate entries in history as to only keep the latest one.

       <b>font_hw_ratio</b>
              Default: auto

              The ratio of font height to font width.  Adjusts grid width of completions.  Values in  the  range
              1.8..2.5 make sense for common monospace fonts.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       This  script  allows  running  and  completing input commands in the console interactively, and also adds
       mpv's log to the console's log.

   <b>Keybindings</b>
       <b>`</b>      Open the console to enter commands.

   <b>Commands</b>
       <b>script-binding</b> <b>commands/open</b>
          Open the console to enter commands.

       <b>script-message-to</b> <b>commands</b> <b>type</b> <b>&lt;text&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;cursor_pos&gt;]</b>
              Show the console and pre-fill it with the provided text, optionally specifying the initial  cursor
              position  as a positive integer starting from 1. The console is automatically closed after running
              the command.

                 Examples for input.conf

                 <b>%</b> <b>script-message-to</b> <b>commands</b> <b>type</b> <b>"seek</b> <b>absolute-percent"</b> <b>6</b>
                        Enter a percent position to seek to.

                 <b>Ctrl+o</b> <b>script-message-to</b> <b>console</b> <b>type</b> <b>"loadfile</b> <b>''"</b> <b>11</b>
                        Enter a file or URL to play, with autocompletion of paths in the filesystem.

   <b>Configuration</b>
       This script can be customized through a  config  file  <b>script-opts/commands.conf</b>  placed  in  mpv's  user
       directory  and  through  the  <b>--script-opts</b> command-line option. The configuration syntax is described in
       mp.options functions.

   <b>Configurable</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>persist_history</b>
              Default: no

              Whether to save the command history to a file and load it.

       <b>history_path</b>
              Default: <b>~~state/command_history.txt</b>

              The file path for <b>persist_history</b> (see PATHS).

</pre><h4><b>SELECT</b></h4><pre>
       console can present a list of items to browse and select from with the <b>mp.input.select</b> API. <b>select.lua</b> is
       a builtin client of this API providing script bindings that gather and format the data to be selected  in
       the console and do operations on the selected item. It can be disabled using the <b>--load-select=no</b> option.

   <b>Key</b> <b>bindings</b>
       When  using  <b>mp.input.select</b>, typing printable characters does a fuzzy search of the presented items, and
       key bindings listed in CONSOLE are extended with the following:

       <b>ENTER,</b> <b>Ctrl+j</b> <b>and</b> <b>Ctrl+m</b>
              Confirm the selection of the highlighted item.

       <b>UP</b> <b>and</b> <b>Ctrl+p</b>
              Select the item above, or the last one when the first item is selected.

       <b>DOWN</b> <b>and</b> <b>Ctrl+n</b>
              Select the item below, or the first one when the last item is selected.

       <b>PGUP</b> <b>and</b> <b>Ctrl+b</b>
              Scroll up one page.

       <b>PGDN</b> <b>and</b> <b>Ctrl+f</b>
              Scroll down one page.

       <b>MBTN_LEFT</b>
              Confirm the selection of the highlighted item, or close the console if  clicking  outside  of  the
              menu rectangle.

       <b>WHEEL_UP</b>
              Scroll up.

       <b>WHEEL_DOWN</b>
              Scroll down.

   <b>Script</b> <b>bindings</b>
       By  default  select.lua's  script  bindings are bound to key sequences starting with <b>g</b> listed in Keyboard
       Control. The names of the script bindings listed below can be used to bind them to different keys.

          Example to rebind playlist selection in input.conf

                 Ctrl+p script-binding select/select-playlist

       Available script bindings are:

       <b>select-playlist</b>
              Select a playlist entry. <b>--osd-playlist-entry</b> determines how playlist entries are formatted.

       <b>select-sid</b>
              Select a subtitle track, or disable the current one.

       <b>select-secondary-sid</b>
              Select a secondary subtitle track, or disable the current one.

       <b>select-aid</b>
              Select an audio track, or disable the current one.

       <b>select-vid</b>
              Select a video track, or disable the current one.

       <b>select-track</b>
              Select a track of any type, or disable a selected track.

       <b>select-chapter</b>
              Select a chapter.

       <b>select-edition</b>
              Select an MKV edition or DVD/Blu-ray title.

       <b>select-subtitle-line</b>
              Select a subtitle line to seek to. This doesn't work with image subtitles.

              This currently requires <b>ffmpeg</b> in <b>PATH</b>, or in the same folder as mpv on Windows.

       <b>select-audio-device</b>
              Select an audio device.

       <b>select-watch-history</b>
              Select a file from the watch history. Requires <b>--save-watch-history</b>.

              If you don't already use <b>--autocreate-playlist</b>, it is recommended to enable it  with  this  script
              binding to populate the playlist with the other files in the entry's directory.

                 Example for input.conf to play files adjacent to the history entry

                        g-h script-binding select/select-watch-history; no-osd set autocreate-playlist filter

       <b>select-watch-later</b>
              Select  a  file  from watch later config files (see RESUMING PLAYBACK) to resume playing. Requires
              <b>--write-filename-in-watch-later-config</b>.          This          doesn't          work          with
              <b>--ignore-path-in-watch-later-config</b>.

              If  you  don't  already use <b>--autocreate-playlist</b>, it is recommended to enable it with this script
              binding to populate the playlist with the other files in the entry's directory.

                 Example for input.conf to play files adjacent to the watch later entry

                        g-w script-binding select/select-watch-later; no-osd set autocreate-playlist filter

       <b>select-binding</b>
              List the defined input bindings. You can also select one to run the associated command.

       <b>show-properties</b>
              List the names and values of all properties. You can also select one to print  its  value  on  the
              OSD, which is useful for long values that get clipped.

       <b>menu</b>   Show a menu with miscellaneous entries.

   <b>Configuration</b>
       This  script  can  be  customized  through  a  config  file  <b>script-opts/select.conf</b> placed in mpv's user
       directory and through the <b>--script-opts</b> command-line option. The configuration  syntax  is  described  in
       mp.options functions.

   <b>Configurable</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>history_date_format</b>
              Default: %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S

              The  format  of  dates  of  history  entries. This is passed to Lua's <b>os.date</b>, which uses the same
              formats as <b><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a>(3)</b>.

       <b>hide_history_duplicates</b>
              Default: yes

              Whether to show only the last of history entries with the same path.

</pre><h4><b>POSITIONING</b></h4><pre>
       This script  provides  script  bindings  to  pan  videos  and  images.  It  can  be  disabled  using  the
       <b>--load-positioning=no</b> option.

   <b>Script</b> <b>bindings</b>
       <b>pan-x</b> <b>&lt;amount&gt;</b>
              Adjust <b>--video-align-x</b> relatively to the OSD width, rather than relatively to the video width like
              the option. This is useful to pan large images consistently.

              <b>amount</b> is a number such that an amount of 1 scrolls as much as the OSD width.

       <b>pan-y</b> <b>&lt;amount&gt;</b>
              Adjust  <b>--video-align-y</b>  relatively  to the OSD height, rather than relatively to the video height
              like the option.

              <b>amount</b> is a number such that an amount of 1 scrolls as much as the OSD height.

       <b>drag-to-pan</b>
              Pan the video while holding a mouse button, keeping the  clicked  part  of  the  video  under  the
              cursor.

       <b>align-to-cursor</b>
              Pan   through  the  whole  video  while  holding  a  mouse  button,  or  after  clicking  once  if
              <b>toggle_align_to_cursor</b> is <b>yes</b>.

       <b>cursor-centric-zoom</b> <b>&lt;amount&gt;</b>
              Increase <b>--video-zoom</b> by <b>amount</b> while keeping the part of the video hovered by  the  cursor  under
              it, or the average position of touch points if known.

   <b>Configuration</b>
       This  script  can  be  customized through a config file <b>script-opts/positioning.conf</b> placed in mpv's user
       directory and through the <b>--script-opts</b> command-line option. The configuration  syntax  is  described  in
       mp.options functions.

   <b>Configurable</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>toggle_align_to_cursor</b>
              Default: no

              Whether <b>align-to-cursor</b> requires holding down a mouse button to pan. If <b>no</b>, dragging pans. If <b>yes</b>,
              clicking the first time makes pan follow the cursor, and clicking a second time disables this.

       <b>suppress_osd</b>
              Default: no

              Whether to not print the new value of <b>--video-zoom</b> when using <b>cursor-centric-zoom</b>.

</pre><h4><b>LUA</b> <b>SCRIPTING</b></h4><pre>
       mpv can load Lua scripts. (See Script location.)

       mpv  provides  the  built-in  module <b>mp</b>, which contains functions to send commands to the mpv core and to
       retrieve information about playback state, user settings, file information, and so on.

       These scripts can be used to control mpv in a similar way to slave mode.  Technically, the Lua code  uses
       the client API internally.

   <b>Example</b>
       A script which leaves fullscreen mode when the player is paused:

          function on_pause_change(name, value)
              if value == true then
                  mp.set_property("fullscreen", "no")
              end
          end
          mp.observe_property("pause", "bool", on_pause_change)

   <b>Script</b> <b>location</b>
       Scripts  can be passed to the <b>--script</b> option, and are automatically loaded from the <b>scripts</b> subdirectory
       of the mpv configuration directory (usually <b><a href="file:~/.config/mpv/scripts/">~/.config/mpv/scripts/</a></b>).

       A script can be a single file. The file extension is used to select the scripting backend to use for  it.
       For  Lua,  it is <b>.lua</b>. If the extension is not recognized, an error is printed. (If an error happens, the
       extension is either mistyped, or the backend was not compiled into your mpv binary.)

       mpv internally loads the script's name by stripping the <b>.lua</b> extension and replacing all  nonalphanumeric
       characters  with <b>_</b>. E.g., <b>my-tools.lua</b> becomes <b>my_tools</b>. If there are several scripts with the same name,
       it is made unique by appending a number. This is the name returned by <b>mp.get_script_name()</b>.

       Entries with <b>.disable</b> extension are always ignored.

       If a script is a directory (either if a directory is passed to <b>--script</b>, or any  sub-directories  in  the
       script  directory, such as for example <b><a href="file:~/.config/mpv/scripts/something/">~/.config/mpv/scripts/something/</a></b>), then the directory represents a
       single script. The player will try to load a file named  <b>main.x</b>,  where  <b>x</b>  is  replaced  with  the  file
       extension. For example, if <b>main.lua</b> exists, it is loaded with the Lua scripting backend.

       You  must  not  put  any  other  files  or  directories that start with <b>main.</b> into the script's top level
       directory. If the script directory contains for example both <b>main.lua</b> and <b>main.js</b>, only one of them  will
       be  loaded  (and  which one depends on mpv internals that may change any time). Likewise, if there is for
       example <b>main.foo</b>, your script will break as soon as mpv adds a backend that uses the <b>.foo</b> file extension.

       mpv also appends the top level directory of the script to the start of Lua's  package  path  so  you  can
       import  scripts  from  there  too. Be aware that this will shadow Lua libraries that use the same package
       path. (Single file scripts do not include mpv specific directories in the  Lua  package  path.  This  was
       silently changed in mpv 0.32.0.)

       Using  a  script  directory  is  the recommended way to package a script that consists of multiple source
       files, or requires other files (you can use <b>mp.get_script_directory()</b> to get the location and  e.g.  load
       data files).

       Making  a  script  a  git  repository,  basically a repository which contains a <b>main.lua</b> file in the root
       directory, makes scripts easily updateable (without the dangers of auto-updates). Another  suggestion  is
       to use git submodules to share common files or libraries.

   <b>Details</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>script</b> <b>initialization</b> <b>and</b> <b>lifecycle</b>
       Your script will be loaded by the player at program start from the <b>scripts</b> configuration subdirectory, or
       from  a  path  specified  with the <b>--script</b> option. Some scripts are loaded internally (like <b>--osc</b>). Each
       script runs in its own thread. Your script is first run "as is", and once that is done, the event loop is
       entered. This event loop will dispatch events received by mpv and call your own event handlers which  you
       have  registered  with <b>mp.register_event</b>, or timers added with <b>mp.add_timeout</b> or similar. Note that since
       the script starts execution concurrently with player initialization, some properties may not be populated
       with meaningful values until the relevant subsystems  have  initialized.  Rather  than  retrieving  these
       properties at the top of scripts, you should use <b>mp.observe_property</b> or read them within event handlers.

       When  the  player quits, all scripts will be asked to terminate. This happens via a <b>shutdown</b> event, which
       by default will make the event loop return. If your script got into an endless loop,  mpv  will  probably
       behave fine during playback, but it won't terminate when quitting, because it's waiting on your script.

       Internally, the C code will call the Lua function <b>mp_event_loop</b> after loading a Lua script. This function
       is  normally defined by the default prelude loaded before your script (see <b>player/lua/defaults.lua</b> in the
       mpv sources).  The event loop will wait for events and dispatch events registered with <b>mp.register_event</b>.
       It will also handle timers added with <b>mp.add_timeout</b> and similar (by waiting with a timeout).

       Since mpv 0.6.0, the player will  wait  until  the  script  is  fully  loaded  before  continuing  normal
       operation.  The player considers a script as fully loaded as soon as it starts waiting for mpv events (or
       it exits). In practice this means the player will more or less hang until the  script  returns  from  the
       main  chunk  (and  <b>mp_event_loop</b>  is  called),  or  the  script calls <b>mp_event_loop</b> or <b>mp.dispatch_events</b>
       directly. This is done to make it possible for a  script  to  fully  setup  event  handlers  etc.  before
       playback  actually  starts.  In  older  mpv versions, this happened asynchronously. With mpv 0.29.0, this
       changes slightly, and it merely waits for scripts to be loaded in this manner before starting playback as
       part of the player initialization phase. Scripts run though initialization in parallel. This might change
       again.

   <b>mp</b> <b>functions</b>
       The <b>mp</b> module is preloaded, although it can be loaded manually with <b>require</b> <b>'mp'</b>. It  provides  the  core
       client API.

       <b>mp.command(string)</b>
              Run  the  given  command.  This  is similar to the commands used in input.conf.  See List of Input
              Commands.

              By default, this will show something on the OSD (depending on the command), as if it was  used  in
              <b>input.conf</b>. See Input Command Prefixes how to influence OSD usage per command.

              Returns <b>true</b> on success, or <b>nil,</b> <b>error</b> on error.

       <b>mp.commandv(arg1,</b> <b>arg2,</b> <b>...)</b>
              Similar  to  <b>mp.command</b>,  but  pass  each  command  argument  as  separate parameter. This has the
              advantage that you don't have to care about quoting and escaping in some cases.

              Example:

                 mp.command("loadfile " .. filename .. " append")
                 mp.commandv("loadfile", filename, "append")

              These two commands are equivalent, except that the first version breaks if the  filename  contains
              spaces or certain special characters.

              Note  that  properties  are  <u>not</u>  expanded.   You can use either <b>mp.command</b>, the <b>expand-properties</b>
              prefix, or the <b>mp.get_property</b> family of functions.

              Unlike <b>mp.command</b>, this will  not  use  OSD  by  default  either  (except  for  some  OSD-specific
              commands).

       <b>mp.command_native(table</b> <b>[,def])</b>
              Similar  to  <b>mp.commandv</b>,  but  pass the argument list as table. This has the advantage that in at
              least some cases, arguments can be passed as native  types.  It  also  allows  you  to  use  named
              argument.

              If  the  table  is  an  array,  each array item is like an argument in <b>mp.commandv()</b> (but can be a
              native type instead of a string).

              If the table contains string keys, it's interpreted as command with named arguments. This requires
              at least an entry with the key <b>name</b> to be present, which  must  be  a  string,  and  contains  the
              command  name.  The  special  entry  <b>_flags</b> is optional, and if present, must be an array of Input
              Command Prefixes to apply. All other entries are interpreted as arguments.

              Returns a result table on success (usually empty), or <b>def,</b> <b>error</b>  on  error.  <b>def</b>  is  the  second
              parameter provided to the function, and is nil if it's missing.

       <b>mp.command_native_async(table</b> <b>[,fn])</b>
              Like  <b>mp.command_native()</b>,  but  the  command is ran asynchronously (as far as possible), and upon
              completion, fn is called. fn has three arguments: <b>fn(success,</b> <b>result,</b> <b>error)</b>:

                     <b>success</b>
                            Always a Boolean and is true if the command was successful, otherwise false.

                 <b>result</b> The result value (can be nil)  in  case  of  success,  nil  otherwise  (as  returned  by
                        <b>mp.command_native()</b>).

                 <b>error</b>  The error string in case of an error, nil otherwise.

              Returns a table with undefined contents, which can be used as argument for <b>mp.abort_async_command</b>.

              If  starting  the  command  failed  for  some  reason,  <b>nil,</b>  <b>error</b>  is returned, and <b>fn</b> is called
              indicating failure, using the same error value.

              <b>fn</b> is always called asynchronously, even if the command failed to start.

       <b>mp.abort_async_command(t)</b>
              Abort a <b>mp.command_native_async</b> call. The argument is the return  value  of  that  command  (which
              starts  asynchronous  execution of the command).  Whether this works and how long it takes depends
              on the command and the situation. The abort call itself is asynchronous. Does not return anything.

       <b>mp.del_property(name)</b>
              Delete the  given  property.  See  <b>mp.get_property</b>  and  Properties  for  more  information  about
              properties. Most properties cannot be deleted.

              Returns true on success, or <b>nil,</b> <b>error</b> on error.

       <b>mp.get_property(name</b> <b>[,def])</b>
              Return  the  value  of  the  given  property  as  string. These are the same properties as used in
              input.conf. See Properties for a list of properties. The returned string is formatted  similar  to
              <b>${=name}</b> (see Property Expansion).

              Returns the string on success, or <b>def,</b> <b>error</b> on error. <b>def</b> is the second parameter provided to the
              function, and is nil if it's missing.

       <b>mp.get_property_osd(name</b> <b>[,def])</b>
              Similar  to  <b>mp.get_property</b>,  but  return  the property value formatted for OSD. This is the same
              string as printed with <b>${name}</b> when used in input.conf.

              Returns the string on success, or <b>def,</b> <b>error</b> on error. <b>def</b> is the second parameter provided to the
              function, and is an empty string if it's missing.  Unlike  <b>get_property()</b>,  assigning  the  return
              value to a variable will always result in a string.

       <b>mp.get_property_bool(name</b> <b>[,def])</b>
              Similar to <b>mp.get_property</b>, but return the property value as Boolean.

              Returns a Boolean on success, or <b>def,</b> <b>error</b> on error.

       <b>mp.get_property_number(name</b> <b>[,def])</b>
              Similar to <b>mp.get_property</b>, but return the property value as number.

              Note  that  while  Lua  does  not  distinguish between integers and floats, mpv internals do. This
              function simply request a double float from mpv, and mpv will  usually  convert  integer  property
              values to float.

              Returns a number on success, or <b>def,</b> <b>error</b> on error.

       <b>mp.get_property_native(name</b> <b>[,def])</b>
              Similar  to  <b>mp.get_property</b>,  but  return  the  property  value  using  the best Lua type for the
              property. Most time, this will return a string, Boolean, or number. Some properties  (for  example
              <b>chapter-list</b>) are returned as tables.

              Returns a value on success, or <b>def,</b> <b>error</b> on error. Note that <b>nil</b> might be a possible, valid value
              too in some corner cases.

       <b>mp.set_property(name,</b> <b>value)</b>
              Set  the  given  property  to  the given string value. See <b>mp.get_property</b> and Properties for more
              information about properties.

              Returns true on success, or <b>nil,</b> <b>error</b> on error.

       <b>mp.set_property_bool(name,</b> <b>value)</b>
              Similar to <b>mp.set_property</b>, but set the given property to the given Boolean value.

       <b>mp.set_property_number(name,</b> <b>value)</b>
              Similar to <b>mp.set_property</b>, but set the given property to the given numeric value.

              Note that while Lua does not distinguish between integers  and  floats,  mpv  internals  do.  This
              function  will  test  whether the number can be represented as integer, and if so, it will pass an
              integer value to mpv, otherwise a double float.

       <b>mp.set_property_native(name,</b> <b>value)</b>
              Similar to <b>mp.set_property</b>, but set the given property using its native type.

              Since there are several data types which cannot represented natively in Lua, this might not always
              work as expected. For example, while the Lua wrapper can do some guesswork to decide whether a Lua
              table is an array or a map, this would fail with empty tables. Also, there are not many properties
              for  which  it  makes  sense  to   use   this,   instead   of   <b>set_property</b>,   <b>set_property_bool</b>,
              <b>set_property_number</b>.   For these reasons, this function should probably be avoided for now, except
              for properties that use tables natively.

       <b>mp.get_time()</b>
              Return the current mpv internal time in seconds as a number. This is basically  the  system  time,
              with an arbitrary offset.

       <b>mp.add_key_binding(key,</b> <b>name|fn</b> <b>[,fn</b> <b>[,flags]])</b>
              Register  callback  to be run on a key binding. The binding will be mapped to the given <b>key</b>, which
              is a string describing the physical key. This uses the same key names as in input.conf,  and  also
              allows  combinations (e.g. <b>ctrl+a</b>). If the key is empty or <b>nil</b>, no physical key is registered, but
              the user still can create own bindings (see below).

              After calling this function, key presses will cause the function <b>fn</b> to be called (unless the  user
              remapped  the  key  with another binding).  However, if the key binding is canceled , the function
              will not be called, unless <b>complex</b> flag is set to <b>true</b>, where the function will be called with the
              <b>canceled</b> entry set to <b>true</b>.

              For example, a canceled key binding can happen in the following situations:

              • If key A is pressed while key B is being held down, key B is logically released  ("canceled"  by
                key A), which stops the current autorepeat action key B has.

              • If  key  A  is  pressed  while  a mouse button is being held down, the mouse button is logically
                released, but the mouse button's action will not be called, unless <b>complex</b> flag is set to <b>true</b>.

              The <b>name</b> argument should be a short symbolic string. It allows the user to remap the  key  binding
              via input.conf using the <b>script-message</b> command, and the name of the key binding (see below for an
              example).  The  name  should  be  unique  across  other  bindings in the same script - if not, the
              previous binding with the same name will be overwritten. You can omit the name, in  which  case  a
              random name is generated internally. (Omitting works as follows: either pass <b>nil</b> for <b>name</b>, or pass
              the  <b>fn</b>  argument  in  place  of  the  name.  The  latter  is  not  recommended and is handled for
              compatibility only.)

              The <b>flags</b> argument is used for optional parameters. This is a table, which can have the  following
              entries:

                 <b>repeatable</b>
                        If  set  to  <b>true</b>, enables key repeat for this specific binding.  This option only makes
                        sense when <b>complex</b> is not set to <b>true</b>.

                 <b>scalable</b>
                        If set to <b>true</b>, enables key scaling for this specific binding.  This option  only  makes
                        sense  when  <b>complex</b> is set to <b>true</b>.  Note that this has no effect if the key binding is
                        invoked  by  <b>script-binding</b>  command,  where  the  scalability  of  the  command   takes
                        precedence.

                 <b>complex</b>
                        If  set  to  <b>true</b>,  then  <b>fn</b> is called on key down, repeat and up events, with the first
                        argument being  a  table.  This  table  has  the  following  entries  (and  may  contain
                        undocumented ones):

                            <b>event</b>  Set  to  one  of  the  strings  <b>down</b>,  <b>repeat</b>, <b>up</b> or <b>press</b> (the latter if key
                                   up/down/repeat can't be tracked), which indicates the key's logical state.

                            <b>is_mouse</b>
                                   Boolean: Whether the event was caused by a mouse button.

                            <b>canceled</b>
                                   Boolean: Whether the event was canceled.  Not all types of cancellations  set
                                   this flag.

                            <b>key_name</b>
                                   The  name of they key that triggered this, or <b>nil</b> if invoked artificially. If
                                   the key name is unknown, it's an empty string.

                            <b>key_text</b>
                                   Text  if  triggered  by  a  text  key,  otherwise  <b>nil</b>.  See  description  of
                                   <b>script-binding</b>  command  for  details  (this  field  is equivalent to the 5th
                                   argument).

                            <b>scale</b>  The scale of the key, such as the ones produced by <b>WHEEL_*</b> keys. The scale is
                                   1 if the key is nonscalable.

                            <b>arg</b>    User-provided string in the <b>arg</b> argument in the <b>script-binding</b> command if the
                                   key binding is invoked by that command.

              Internally, key bindings are dispatched via the <b>script-message-to</b> or <b>script-binding</b> input commands
              and <b>mp.register_script_message</b>.

              Trying to map multiple commands to a key will essentially prefer a random binding, while the other
              bindings are not called. It is guaranteed that user defined bindings in the central input.conf are
              preferred over bindings added with this function (but see <b>mp.add_forced_key_binding</b>).

              Example:

                 function something_handler()
                     print("the key was pressed")
                 end
                 mp.add_key_binding("x", "something", something_handler)

              This will print the message <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>was</b> <b>pressed</b> when <b>x</b> was pressed.

              The user can remap these key bindings.  Then  the  user  has  to  put  the  following  into  their
              input.conf to remap the command to the <b>y</b> key:

                 y script-binding something

              This  will print the message when the key <b>y</b> is pressed. (<b>x</b> will still work, unless the user remaps
              it.)

              You can also explicitly send a message to a named script only. Assume the above script  was  using
              the filename <b>fooscript.lua</b>:

                 y script-binding fooscript/something

       <b>mp.add_forced_key_binding(...)</b>
              This works almost the same as <b>mp.add_key_binding</b>, but registers the key binding in a way that will
              overwrite  the  user's custom bindings in their input.conf. (<b>mp.add_key_binding</b> overwrites default
              key bindings only, but not those by the user's input.conf.)

       <b>mp.remove_key_binding(name)</b>
              Remove a key binding added with <b>mp.add_key_binding</b> or <b>mp.add_forced_key_binding</b>. Use the same name
              as you used when adding the bindings. It's not possible to remove bindings for which  you  omitted
              the name.

       <b>mp.register_event(name,</b> <b>fn)</b>
              Call a specific function when an event happens. The event name is a string, and the function fn is
              a Lua function value.

              Some  events  have associated data. This is put into a Lua table and passed as argument to fn. The
              Lua table by default contains a <b>name</b> field, which is a string containing the event  name.  If  the
              event has an error associated, the <b>error</b> field is set to a string describing the error, on success
              it's not set.

              If multiple functions are registered for the same event, they are run in registration order, which
              the first registered function running before all the other ones.

              Returns true if such an event exists, false otherwise.

              See Events and List of events for details.

       <b>mp.unregister_event(fn)</b>
              Undo  <b>mp.register_event(...,</b>  <b>fn)</b>.  This  removes  all  event  handlers  that  are equal to the <b>fn</b>
              parameter. This uses normal Lua <b>==</b> comparison, so be careful when dealing with closures.

       <b>mp.observe_property(name,</b> <b>type,</b> <b>fn)</b>
              Watch a property for changes. If the property <b>name</b> is changed, then the function <b>fn(name)</b> will  be
              called.  <b>type</b>  can be <b>nil</b>, or be set to one of <b>none</b>, <b>native</b>, <b>bool</b>, <b>string</b>, or <b>number</b>.  <b>none</b> is the
              same as <b>nil</b>. For all other values, the new value of the property will be passed as second argument
              to <b>fn</b>, using <b>mp.get_property_&lt;type&gt;</b> to retrieve it. This means if <b>type</b> is for example  <b>string</b>,  <b>fn</b>
              is roughly called as in <b>fn(name,</b> <b>mp.get_property_string(name))</b>.

              If possible, change events are coalesced. If a property is changed a bunch of times in a row, only
              the  last  change  triggers  the  change function. (The exact behavior depends on timing and other
              things.)

              If  a  property  is  unavailable,  or  on  error,  the  value  argument  to  <b>fn</b>   is   <b>nil</b>.   (The
              <b>observe_property()</b> call always succeeds, even if a property does not exist.)

              In  some  cases  the  function  is  not  called even if the property changes.  This depends on the
              property, and it's a valid feature request to  ask  for  better  update  handling  of  a  specific
              property.

              If  the  <b>type</b>  is  <b>none</b>  or  <b>nil</b>,  the  change function <b>fn</b> will be called sporadically even if the
              property doesn't actually change. You should therefore avoid using these types.

              You always get an initial change notification. This is meant to initialize the user's state to the
              current value of the property.

       <b>mp.unobserve_property(fn)</b>
              Undo <b>mp.observe_property(...,</b> <b>fn)</b>. This removes all property handlers that are  equal  to  the  <b>fn</b>
              parameter. This uses normal Lua <b>==</b> comparison, so be careful when dealing with closures.

       <b>mp.add_timeout(seconds,</b> <b>fn</b> <b>[,</b> <b>disabled])</b>
              Call  the given function fn when the given number of seconds has elapsed.  Note that the number of
              seconds can be fractional. For now, the timer's resolution may be as low as 50 ms,  although  this
              will be improved in the future.

              If  the  <b>disabled</b>  argument  is  set to <b>true</b> or a truthy value, the timer will wait to be manually
              started with a call to its <b>resume()</b> method.

              This is a one-shot timer: it will be removed when it's fired.

              Returns a timer object. See <b>mp.add_periodic_timer</b> for details.

       <b>mp.add_periodic_timer(seconds,</b> <b>fn</b> <b>[,</b> <b>disabled])</b>
              Call the given function periodically. This is like <b>mp.add_timeout</b>, but the timer is re-added after
              the function fn is run.

              <b>Returns</b> <b>a</b> <b>timer</b> <b>object.</b> <b>The</b> <b>timer</b> <b>object</b> <b>provides</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>methods:</b>

                     <b>stop()</b> Disable the timer. Does nothing  if  the  timer  is  already  disabled.   This  will
                            remember  the  current  elapsed  time  when  stopping,  so that <b>resume()</b> essentially
                            unpauses the timer.

                     <b>kill()</b> Disable the timer. Resets the elapsed time. <b>resume()</b> will restart the timer.

                     <b>resume()</b>
                            Restart the timer. If the timer was disabled with <b>stop()</b>, this will  resume  at  the
                            time  it was stopped. If the timer was disabled with <b>kill()</b>, or if it's a previously
                            fired one-shot timer (added with <b>add_timeout()</b>), this  starts  the  timer  from  the
                            beginning, using the initially configured timeout.

                     <b>is_enabled()</b>
                            Whether the timer is currently enabled or was previously disabled (e.g. by <b>stop()</b> or
                            <b>kill()</b>).

                     <b>timeout</b> <b>(RW)</b>
                            This  field  contains  the current timeout period. This value is not updated as time
                            progresses. It's only used to calculate when the timer should  fire  next  when  the
                            timer expires.

                            If  you  write this, you can call <b>t:kill()</b> <b>;</b> <b>t:resume()</b> to reset the current timeout
                            to the new one. (<b>t:stop()</b> won't use the new timeout.)

                     <b>oneshot</b> <b>(RW)</b>
                            Whether the timer is periodic (<b>false</b>) or fires just once (<b>true</b>). This value is  used
                            when the timer expires (but before the timer callback function fn is run).

              Note  that  these  are  methods,  and  you  have  to  call  them  using  <b>:</b>  instead of <b>.</b> (Refer to
              &lt;https://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#3.4.9&gt;  .)

              Example:

                 seconds = 0
                 timer = mp.add_periodic_timer(1, function()
                     print("called every second")
                     -- stop it after 10 seconds
                     seconds = seconds + 1
                     if seconds &gt;= 10 then
                         timer:kill()
                     end
                 end)

       <b>mp.get_opt(key)</b>
              Return a setting from the <b>--script-opts</b> option. It's up to  the  user  and  the  script  how  this
              mechanism  is used. Currently, all scripts can access this equally, so you should be careful about
              collisions.

       <b>mp.get_script_name()</b>
              Return the name of the current script. The name is usually made of the  filename  of  the  script,
              with  directory and file extension removed. If there are several scripts which would have the same
              name, it's made unique by appending a number. Any nonalphanumeric characters are replaced with <b>_</b>.

                 Example

                        The script <b>/path/to/foo-script.lua</b> becomes <b>foo_script</b>.

       <b>mp.get_script_directory()</b>
              Return the directory if this is a  script  packaged  as  directory  (see  Script  location  for  a
              description). Return nothing if this is a single file script.

       <b>mp.osd_message(text</b> <b>[,duration])</b>
              Show an OSD message on the screen. <b>duration</b> is in seconds, and is optional (uses <b>--osd-duration</b> by
              default).

   <b>Advanced</b> <b>mp</b> <b>functions</b>
       These  also  live  in  the  <b>mp</b>  module,  but are documented separately as they are useful only in special
       situations.

       <b>mp.get_wakeup_pipe()</b>
              Calls <b>mpv_get_wakeup_pipe()</b> and returns the read end of the wakeup pipe. This is  deprecated,  but
              still works. (See <b>client.h</b> for details.)

       <b>mp.get_next_timeout()</b>
              Return  the  relative time in seconds when the next timer (<b>mp.add_timeout</b> and similar) expires. If
              there is no timer, return <b>nil</b>.

       <b>mp.dispatch_events([allow_wait])</b>
              This can be used to run custom event loops. If you want to have direct control what the Lua script
              does (instead of being called by the  default  event  loop),  you  can  set  the  global  variable
              <b>mp_event_loop</b>  to  your own function running the event loop. From your event loop, you should call
              <b>mp.dispatch_events()</b> to dequeue and dispatch mpv events.

              If the <b>allow_wait</b> parameter is set to <b>true</b>, the function  will  block  until  the  next  event  is
              received  or  the  next timer expires. Otherwise (and this is the default behavior), it returns as
              soon as the event loop is emptied. It's strongly  recommended  to  use  <b>mp.get_next_timeout()</b>  and
              <b>mp.get_wakeup_pipe()</b>  if  you're  interested  in  properly  working notification of new events and
              working timers.

       <b>mp.register_idle(fn)</b>
              Register an event loop idle handler. Idle handlers are called before  the  script  goes  to  sleep
              after handling all new events. This can be used for example to delay processing of property change
              events:  if  you're  observing  multiple  properties  at  once,  you might not want to act on each
              property change, but only when all change notifications have been received.

       <b>mp.unregister_idle(fn)</b>
              Undo <b>mp.register_idle(fn)</b>. This removes all idle handlers that are equal to the <b>fn</b> parameter. This
              uses normal Lua <b>==</b> comparison, so be careful when dealing with closures.

       <b>mp.enable_messages(level)</b>
              Set the minimum log level of which mpv message output to  receive.  These  messages  are  normally
              printed  to  the terminal. By calling this function, you can set the minimum log level of messages
              which should be received with the <b>log-message</b>  event.  See  the  description  of  this  event  for
              details.  The level is a string, see <b>msg.log</b> for allowed log levels.

       <b>mp.register_script_message(name,</b> <b>fn)</b>
              This  is a helper to dispatch <b>script-message</b> or <b>script-message-to</b> invocations to Lua functions. <b>fn</b>
              is called if <b>script-message</b> or <b>script-message-to</b> (with this script as  destination)  is  run  with
              <b>name</b>  as first parameter. The other parameters are passed to <b>fn</b>.  If a message with the given name
              is already registered, it's overwritten.

              Used by <b>mp.add_key_binding</b>, so be careful about name collisions.

       <b>mp.unregister_script_message(name)</b>
              Undo a previous registration with <b>mp.register_script_message</b>. Does  nothing  if  the  <b>name</b>  wasn't
              registered.

       <b>mp.create_osd_overlay(format)</b>
              Create  an  OSD  overlay. This is a very thin wrapper around the <b>osd-overlay</b> command. The function
              returns a table, which mostly contains fields that will  be  passed  to  <b>osd-overlay</b>.  The  <b>format</b>
              parameter  is  used to initialize the <b>format</b> field. The <b>data</b> field contains the text to be used as
              overlay. For details, see the <b>osd-overlay</b> command.

              In addition, it provides the following methods:

              <b>update()</b>
                     Commit the OSD overlay to the screen, or in other words, run the <b>osd-overlay</b>  command  with
                     the  current  fields  of  the overlay table.  Returns the result of the <b>osd-overlay</b> command
                     itself.

              <b>remove()</b>
                     Remove the overlay from the screen. A <b>update()</b> call will add it again.

              Example:

                 ov = mp.create_osd_overlay("ass-events")
                 ov.data = "{\\an5}{\\b1}hello world!"
                 ov:update()

              The advantage of using this wrapper (as opposed to running <b>osd-overlay</b> directly) is  that  the  <b>id</b>
              field is allocated automatically.

       <b>mp.get_osd_size()</b>
              Returns  a  tuple  of  <b>osd_width,</b>  <b>osd_height,</b>  <b>osd_par</b>. The first two give the size of the OSD in
              pixels (for video outputs like <b>--vo=xv</b>, this may be "scaled" pixels). The  third  is  the  display
              pixel aspect ratio.

              May return invalid/nonsense values if OSD is not initialized yet.

       <b>exit()</b> <b>(global)</b>
              Make  the  script exit at the end of the current event loop iteration. This does not terminate mpv
              itself or other scripts.

              This can be polyfilled to support mpv versions older than 0.40 with:

                 if not _G.exit then
                     function exit()
                         mp.keep_running = false
                     end
                 end

   <b>mp.msg</b> <b>functions</b>
       This module allows outputting messages to the terminal, and can be loaded with <b>require</b> <b>'mp.msg'</b>.

       <b>msg.log(level,</b> <b>...)</b>
              The level parameter is the message priority. It's a string and one of <b>fatal</b>, <b>error</b>, <b>warn</b>, <b>info</b>, <b>v</b>,
              <b>debug</b>, <b>trace</b>. The user's settings  will  determine  which  of  these  messages  will  be  visible.
              Normally, all messages are visible, except <b>v</b>, <b>debug</b> and <b>trace</b>.

              The  parameters  after that are all converted to strings. Spaces are inserted to separate multiple
              parameters.

              You don't need to add newlines.

       <b>msg.fatal(...),</b> <b>msg.error(...),</b> <b>msg.warn(...),</b> <b>msg.info(...),</b> <b>msg.verbose(...),</b> <b>msg.debug(...),</b>
       <b>msg.trace(...)</b>
              All of these are shortcuts and equivalent to the corresponding <b>msg.log(level,</b> <b>...)</b> call.

   <b>mp.options</b> <b>functions</b>
       mpv comes with a built-in module to manage options from config-files and the command-line. All  you  have
       to do is to supply a table with default options to the read_options function. The function will overwrite
       the default values with values found in the config-file and the command-line (in that order).

       <b>options.read_options(table</b> <b>[,</b> <b>identifier</b> <b>[,</b> <b>on_update]])</b>
              A  <b>table</b>  with  key-value  pairs.  The  type of the default values is important for converting the
              values read from the config file or command-line back. Do not use <b>nil</b> as a default value!

              The <b>identifier</b> is used to identify the config-file and the command-line options.  These  needs  to
              unique  to avoid collisions with other scripts.  Defaults to <b>mp.get_script_name()</b> if the parameter
              is <b>nil</b> or missing.

              The <b>on_update</b> parameter enables run-time updates of all matching option values via the <b>script-opts</b>
              option/property. If any of the matching options changes,  the  values  in  the  <b>table</b>  (which  was
              originally  passed  to  the  function) are changed, and <b>on_update(list)</b> is called. <b>list</b> is a table
              where each updated option has a <b>list[option_name]</b> <b>=</b> <b>true</b> entry.  There is no  initial  <b>on_update()</b>
              call.  This  never re-reads the config file.  <b>script-opts</b> is always applied on the original config
              file, ignoring previous <b>script-opts</b> values (for example, if an option is removed from  <b>script-opts</b>
              at runtime, the option will have the value in the config file). <b>table</b> entries are only written for
              option  values  whose  values  effectively  change  (this is important if the script changes <b>table</b>
              entries independently).

       Example implementation:

          local options = {
              optionA = "defaultvalueA",
              optionB = -0.5,
              optionC = true,
          }

          require "mp.options".read_options(options, "myscript")
          print(options.optionA)

       The config file will be stored in <b>script-opts/identifier.conf</b> in mpv's user folder. Comment lines can  be
       started with # and stray spaces are not removed.  Boolean values will be represented with yes/no.

       Example config:

          # comment
          optionA=Hello World
          optionB=9999
          optionC=no

       Command-line  options are read from the <b>--script-opts</b> parameter. To avoid collisions, all keys have to be
       prefixed with <b>identifier-</b>.

       Example command-line:

          --script-opts=myscript-optionA=TEST,myscript-optionB=0,myscript-optionC=yes

   <b>mp.utils</b> <b>functions</b>
       This built-in module provides generic helper functions for Lua, and have strictly speaking nothing to  do
       with  mpv  or  video/audio  playback. They are provided for convenience. Most compensate for Lua's scarce
       standard library.

       Be warned that any of these functions might disappear any  time.  They  are  not  strictly  part  of  the
       guaranteed API.

       <b>utils.getcwd()</b>
              Returns the directory that mpv was launched from. On error, <b>nil,</b> <b>error</b> is returned.

       <b>utils.readdir(path</b> <b>[,</b> <b>filter])</b>
              Enumerate all entries at the given path on the filesystem, and return them as array. Each entry is
              a  directory  entry  (without  the  path).   The list is unsorted (in whatever order the operating
              system returns it).

              If the <b>filter</b> argument is given, it must be one of the following strings:

                 <b>files</b>  List regular files only. This excludes directories,  special  files  (like  UNIX  device
                        files or FIFOs), and dead symlinks. It includes UNIX symlinks to regular files.

                 <b>dirs</b>   List directories only, or symlinks to directories. <b>.</b> and <b>..</b>  are not included.

                 <b>normal</b> Include the results of both <b>files</b> and <b>dirs</b>. (This is the default.)

                 <b>all</b>    List all entries, even device files, dead symlinks, FIFOs, and the <b>.</b> and <b>..</b> entries.

              On error, <b>nil,</b> <b>error</b> is returned.

       <b>utils.file_info(path)</b>
              Stats the given path for information and returns a table with the following entries:

                 <b>mode</b>   protection  bits  (on  Windows,  always  755 (octal) for directories and 644 (octal) for
                        files)

                 <b>size</b>   size in bytes

                 <b>atime</b>  time of last access

                 <b>mtime</b>  time of last modification

                 <b>ctime</b>  time of last metadata change

                 <b>is_file</b>
                        Whether <b>path</b> is a regular file (boolean)

                 <b>is_dir</b> Whether <b>path</b> is a directory (boolean)

              <b>mode</b> and <b>size</b> are integers.  Timestamps (<b>atime</b>, <b>mtime</b> and <b>ctime</b>) are  integer  seconds  since  the
              Unix  epoch  (Unix time).  The booleans <b>is_file</b> and <b>is_dir</b> are provided as a convenience; they can
              be and are derived from <b>mode</b>.

              On error (e.g. path does not exist), <b>nil,</b> <b>error</b> is returned.

       <b>utils.split_path(path)</b>
              Split a path into directory component and filename component, and return them.  The  first  return
              value  is  always  the  directory.  The  second return value is the trailing part of the path, the
              directory entry.

       <b>utils.join_path(p1,</b> <b>p2)</b>
              Return the concatenation of the 2 paths. Tries to be clever. For example, if  <b>p2</b>  is  an  absolute
              path, <b>p2</b> is returned without change.

       <b>utils.subprocess(t)</b>
              Runs an external process and waits until it exits. Returns process status and the captured output.
              This is a legacy wrapper around calling the <b>subprocess</b> command with <b>mp.command_native</b>. It does the
              following things:

              • copy the table <b>t</b>

              • rename <b>cancellable</b> field to <b>playback_only</b>

              • rename <b>max_size</b> to <b>capture_size</b>

              • set <b>capture_stdout</b> field to <b>true</b> if unset

              • set <b>name</b> field to <b>subprocess</b>

              • call <b>mp.command_native(copied_t)</b>

              • if the command failed, create a dummy result table

              • copy <b>error_string</b> to <b>error</b> field if the string is non-empty

              • return the result table

              It is recommended to use <b>mp.command_native</b> or <b>mp.command_native_async</b> directly, instead of calling
              this legacy wrapper. It is for compatibility only.

              See the <b>subprocess</b> documentation for semantics and further parameters.

       <b>utils.subprocess_detached(t)</b>
              Runs an external process and detaches it from mpv's control.

              The parameter <b>t</b> is a table. The function reads the following entries:

                 <b>args</b>   Array of strings of the same semantics as the <b>args</b> used in the <b>subprocess</b> function.

              The function returns <b>nil</b>.

              This is a legacy wrapper around calling the <b>run</b> command with <b>mp.commandv</b> and other functions.

       <b>utils.getpid()</b>
              Returns  the  process  ID of the running mpv process. This can be used to identify the calling mpv
              when launching (detached) subprocesses.

       <b>utils.get_env_list()</b>
              Returns the C environment as a list of strings. (Do not confuse this with the  Lua  "environment",
              which is an unrelated concept.)

       <b>utils.parse_json(str</b> <b>[,</b> <b>trail])</b>
              Parses  the  given  string argument as JSON, and returns it as a Lua table. On error, returns <b>nil,</b>
              <b>error</b>. (Currently, <b>error</b> is just a string reading <b>error</b>, because there is  no  fine-grained  error
              reporting of any kind.)

              The  returned  value  uses  similar  conventions  as <b>mp.get_property_native()</b> to distinguish empty
              objects and arrays.

              If the <b>trail</b> parameter is <b>true</b> (or any value equal to <b>true</b>), then trailing non-whitespace text  is
              tolerated  by the function, and the trailing text is returned as 3rd return value. (The 3rd return
              value is always there, but with <b>trail</b> set, no error is raised.)

       <b>utils.format_json(v)</b>
              Format the given Lua table (or value) as a JSON string and  return  it.  On  error,  returns  <b>nil,</b>
              <b>error</b>. (Errors usually only happen on value types incompatible with JSON.)

              The  argument  value  uses  similar  conventions  as <b>mp.set_property_native()</b> to distinguish empty
              objects and arrays.

       <b>utils.to_string(v)</b>
              Turn the given value into a string. Formats tables and their contents. This  doesn't  do  anything
              special; it is only needed because Lua is terrible.

   <b>mp.input</b> <b>functions</b>
       This module lets scripts get textual input from the user using the console REPL.

       <b>input.get(table)</b>
              Show the console to let the user enter text.

              The following entries of <b>table</b> are read:

              <b>prompt</b> The string to be displayed before the input field.

              <b>submit</b> A  callback  invoked  when  the  user  presses Enter. The first argument is the text in the
                     console.

              <b>keep_open</b>
                     Whether to keep the console open on submit. Defaults to <b>false</b>.

              <b>opened</b> A callback invoked when the console is shown. This can be used to present a list of options
                     with <b>input.set_log()</b>.

              <b>edited</b> A callback invoked when the text changes. The first argument is the text in the console.

              <b>complete</b>
                     A callback invoked when the user edits the text or moves the cursor. The first argument  is
                     the  text  before  the  cursor.  The callback should return a table of the string candidate
                     completion values and the 1-based cursor position from which the completion starts. console
                     will show the completions that fuzzily match the text between this position and the  cursor
                     and allow selecting them.

                     The  third  and  optional  return value is a string that will be appended to the input line
                     without displaying it in the completions.

              <b>autoselect_completion</b>
                     Whether to automatically select the first  completion  on  submit  if  one  wasn't  already
                     manually selected. Defaults to <b>false</b>.

              <b>closed</b> A callback invoked when the console is hidden, either because <b>input.terminate()</b> was invoked
                     from  the  other  callbacks,  or  because  the user closed it with a key binding. The first
                     argument is the text in the console, and the second argument is the cursor position.

              <b>default_text</b>
                     A string to pre-fill the input field with.

              <b>cursor_position</b>
                     The initial cursor position, starting from 1.

              <b>history_path</b>
                     If specified, the path to save and load the history of the entered lines.

              <b>id</b>     An identifier that determines which input history and log buffer  to  use  among  the  ones
                     stored for <b>input.get()</b> calls. Defaults to the calling script name with <b>prompt</b> appended.

       <b>input.terminate()</b>
              Close the console.

       <b>input.log(message,</b> <b>style,</b> <b>terminal_style)</b>
              Add  a  line  to  the  log  buffer. <b>style</b> can contain additional ASS tags to apply to <b>message</b>, and
              <b>terminal_style</b> can contain escape sequences that are used when the console  is  displayed  in  the
              terminal.

       <b><a href="../manmessage/input.log_error.message.html">input.log_error</a>(message)</b>
              Helper  to  add  a  line  to  the log buffer with the same color as the one used for commands that
              error. Useful when the user submits invalid input.

       <b>input.set_log(log)</b>
              Replace the entire log buffer.

              <b>log</b> is a table of strings, or tables with <b>text</b>, <b>style</b> and <b>terminal_style</b> keys.

              Example:

                 input.set_log({
                     "regular text",
                     {
                         text = "error text",
                         style = "{\\c&amp;H7a77f2&amp;}",
                         terminal_style = "\027[31m",
                     }
                 })

       <b>input.select(table)</b>
              Specify a list of items that are presented to the user for selection.

              The following entries of <b>table</b> are read:

              <b>prompt</b> The string to be displayed before the input field.

              <b>items</b>  The table of the entries to choose from.

              <b>default_item</b>
                     The 1-based integer index of the preselected item.

              <b>submit</b> The callback invoked when the user presses Enter. The first argument is the  1-based  index
                     of the selected item.

              <b>keep_open</b>
                     Whether to keep the console open on submit. Defaults to <b>false</b>.

              Example:

                     input.select({
                         items = {
                             "First playlist entry",
                             "Second playlist entry",
                         },
                         submit = function (id)
                             mp.commandv("playlist-play-index", id - 1)
                         end,
                     })

   <b>Events</b>
       Events  are  notifications  from  player  core  to  scripts.  You  can  register  an  event  handler with
       <b>mp.register_event</b>.

       Note that all scripts (and other parts of the player) receive events equally, and there's no  such  thing
       as blocking other scripts from receiving events.

       Example:

          function my_fn(event)
              print("start of playback!")
          end

          mp.register_event("file-loaded", my_fn)

       For the existing event types, see List of events.

   <b>Extras</b>
       This documents experimental features, or features that are "too special" to guarantee a stable interface.

       <b>mp.add_hook(type,</b> <b>priority,</b> <b>fn)</b>
              Add  a hook callback for <b>type</b> (a string identifying a certain kind of hook). These hooks allow the
              player to call script functions and wait for their result (normally, the Lua  scripting  interface
              is  asynchronous from the point of view of the player core). <b>priority</b> is an arbitrary integer that
              allows ordering among hooks of the same kind. Using the value 50 is recommended as neutral default
              value.

              <b>fn(hook)</b> is the function that will be called during execution of the hook. The parameter passed to
              it (<b>hook</b>) is a Lua object that can control further aspects about the currently  invoked  hook.  It
              provides the following methods:

                 <b>defer()</b>
                        Returning  from  the  hook function should not automatically continue the hook. Instead,
                        the API user wants to call <b>hook:cont()</b> on its own at a later point in  time  (before  or
                        after the function has returned).

                 <b>cont()</b> Continue the hook. Doesn't need to be called unless <b>defer()</b> was called.

              See  Hooks  for  currently  existing  hooks  and what they do - only the hook list is interesting;
              handling hook execution is done by the Lua script function automatically.

</pre><h4><b>JAVASCRIPT</b></h4><pre>
       JavaScript support in mpv is near identical to  its  Lua  support.  Use  this  section  as  reference  on
       differences  and  availability  of  APIs, but otherwise you should refer to the Lua documentation for API
       details and general scripting in mpv.

   <b>Example</b>
       JavaScript code which leaves fullscreen mode when the player is paused:

          function on_pause_change(name, value) {
              if (value == true)
                  mp.set_property("fullscreen", "no");
          }
          mp.observe_property("pause", "bool", on_pause_change);

   <b>Similarities</b> <b>with</b> <b>Lua</b>
       mpv tries to load a script file as JavaScript if it has a <b>.js</b> extension, but  otherwise,  the  documented
       Lua options, script directories, loading, etc apply to JavaScript files too.

       Script initialization and lifecycle is the same as with Lua, and most of the Lua functions in the modules
       <b>mp</b>, <b>mp.utils</b>, <b>mp.msg</b>, <b>mp.options</b> and <b>mp.input</b> are available to JavaScript with identical APIs - including
       running commands, getting/setting properties, registering events/key-bindings/hooks, etc.

   <b>Differences</b> <b>from</b> <b>Lua</b>
       No  need  to  load modules. <b>mp</b>, <b>mp.utils</b>,  <b>mp.msg</b>, <b>mp.options</b> and <b>mp.input</b> are preloaded, and you can use
       e.g. <b>var</b> <b>cwd</b> <b>=</b> <b>mp.utils.getcwd();</b> without prior setup.

       Errors are slightly different. Where the Lua APIs return  <b>nil</b>  for  error,  the  JavaScript  ones  return
       <b>undefined</b>.  Where  Lua  returns  <b>something,</b>  <b>error</b>  JavaScript  returns  only <b>something</b> - and makes <b>error</b>
       available via <b>mp.last_error()</b>. Note that only some of the functions have this additional  <b>error</b>  value  -
       typically the same ones which have it in Lua.

       Standard APIs are preferred. For instance <b>setTimeout</b> and <b>JSON.stringify</b> are available, but <b>mp.add_timeout</b>
       and <b>mp.utils.format_json</b> are not.

       No standard library. This means that interaction with anything outside of mpv is limited to the available
       APIs,  typically via <b>mp.utils</b>. However, some file functions were added, and CommonJS <b>require</b> is available
       too - where the loaded modules have the same privileges as normal scripts.

   <b>Language</b> <b>features</b> <b>-</b> <b>ECMAScript</b> <b>5</b>
       The scripting backend which mpv currently uses is MuJS - a compatible minimal ES5 interpreter.  As  such,
       <b>String.substring</b>  is  implemented  for  instance, while the common but non-standard <b>String.substr</b> is not.
       Please consult the MuJS pages on language features and platform support -  &lt;https://mujs.com&gt;  .

              succeeded, or a non-empty error reason string otherwise.

       <b>Error.stack</b> <b>(string)</b>
              When  using <b>try</b> <b>{</b> <b>...</b> <b>}</b> <b>catch(e)</b> <b>{</b> <b>...</b> <b>}</b>, then <b>e.stack</b> is the stack trace of the error - if it was
              created using the <b>Error(...)</b> constructor.

       <b>print</b> <b>(global)</b>
              A convenient alias to <b>mp.msg.info</b>.

       <b>dump</b> <b>(global)</b>
              Like <b>print</b> but also expands objects and arrays recursively.

       <b>mp.utils.getenv(name)</b>
              Returns the value of the host environment variable <b>name</b>, or  <b>undefined</b>  if  the  variable  is  not
              defined.

       <b>mp.utils.get_user_path(path)</b>
              Trivial  wrapper  of  the  <b>expand-path</b>  mpv  command,  returns  a  string.  <b>read_file</b>, <b>write_file</b>,
              <b>append_file</b> and <b>require</b> already  expand  the  path  internally  and  accept  mpv  meta-paths  like
              <b>~~desktop/foo</b>.

       <b>mp.utils.read_file(fname</b> <b>[,max])</b>
              Returns  the  content of file <b>fname</b> as string. If <b>max</b> is provided and not negative, limit the read
              to <b>max</b> bytes.

       <b>mp.utils.write_file(fname,</b> <b>str)</b>
              (Over)write file <b>fname</b> with text content <b>str</b>. <b>fname</b>  must  be  prefixed  with  <b>file://</b>  as  simple
              protection  against  accidental  arguments  switch,  e.g.  <b>mp.utils.write_file("file://<a href="file:~/abc.txt">~/abc.txt</a>",</b>
              <b>"hello</b> <b>world")</b>.

       <b>mp.utils.append_file(fname,</b> <b>str)</b>
              Same as <b>mp.utils.write_file</b> if the file <b>fname</b> does not exist. If it does exist then append instead
              of overwrite.

       Note: <b>read_file</b>, <b>write_file</b> and <b>append_file</b> throw on errors, allow text content only.

       <b>mp.get_time_ms()</b>
              Same as <b>mp.get_time()</b> but in ms instead of seconds.

       <b>mp.get_script_file()</b>
              Returns the file name of the current script.

       <b>mp.utils.compile_js(fname,</b> <b>content_str)</b>
              Compiles the  JS  code  <b>content_str</b>  as  file  name  <b>fname</b>  (without  loading  anything  from  the
              filesystem),  and  returns  it as a function. Very similar to a <b>Function</b> constructor, but shows at
              stack traces as <b>fname</b>.

       <b>mp.module_paths</b>
              Global modules search paths array for the <b>require</b> function (see below).

   <b>Timers</b> <b>(global)</b>
       The standard HTML/node.js timers are available:

       <b>id</b> <b>=</b> <b>setTimeout(fn</b> <b>[,duration</b> <b>[,arg1</b> <b>[,arg2...]]])</b>

       <b>id</b> <b>=</b> <b>setTimeout(code_string</b> <b>[,duration])</b>

       <b>clearTimeout(id)</b>

       <b>id</b> <b>=</b> <b>setInterval(fn</b> <b>[,duration</b> <b>[,arg1</b> <b>[,arg2...]]])</b>

       <b>id</b> <b>=</b> <b>setInterval(code_string</b> <b>[,duration])</b>

       <b>clearInterval(id)</b>

       <b>setTimeout</b> and <b>setInterval</b> return id, and later call <b>fn</b>  (or  execute  <b>code_string</b>)  after  <b>duration</b>  ms.
       Interval also repeat every <b>duration</b>.

       <b>duration</b>  has  a  minimum  and default value of 0, <b>code_string</b> is a plain string which is evaluated as JS
       code, and <b>[,arg1</b> <b>[,arg2..]]</b> are used as arguments (if provided) when calling back <b>fn</b>.

       The <b>clear...(id)</b> functions cancel timer <b>id</b>, and are irreversible.

       Note: timers always call back asynchronously, e.g. <b>setTimeout(fn)</b> will never call <b>fn</b> before returning. <b>fn</b>
       will be called either at the end of this event loop iteration or at a later event loop iteration. This is
       true also for intervals - which also never call back twice at the same event loop iteration.

       Additionally, timers are processed after the event queue is empty, so it's valid to use <b>setTimeout(fn)</b> as
       a one-time idle observer.

   <b>CommonJS</b> <b>modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>require(id)</b>
       CommonJS Modules are a standard system where scripts  can  export  common  functions  for  use  by  other
       scripts.  Specifically,  a  module is a script which adds properties (functions, etc) to its pre-existing
       <b>exports</b> object, which another script can access with <b>require(module-id)</b>. This runs the module and returns
       its <b>exports</b> object. Further calls to <b>require</b> for the same module will return its  cached  <b>exports</b>  object
       without running the module again.

       Modules  and  <b>require</b>  are supported, standard compliant, and generally similar to node.js. However, most
       node.js modules won't run due to missing modules such as <b>fs</b>, <b>process</b>, etc, but some node.js modules  with
       minimal dependencies do work. In general, this is for mpv modules and not a node.js replacement.

       A  <b>.js</b> file extension is always added to <b>id</b>, e.g. <b>require("./foo")</b> will load the file <b>./foo.js</b> and return
       its <b>exports</b> object.

       An id which starts with <b>./</b> or <b>../</b> is relative to the script or module which <b>require</b>  it.  Otherwise  it's
       considered a top-level id (CommonJS term).

       Top-level  id  is  evaluated  as  absolute  filesystem path if possible, e.g. <b>/x/y</b> or <b><a href="file:~/x">~/x</a></b>. Otherwise it's
       considered a global module id and searched according to  <b>mp.module_paths</b>  in  normal  array  order,  e.g.
       <b>require("x")</b> tries to load <b>x.js</b> at one of the array paths, and id <b>foo/x</b> tries to load <b>x.js</b> inside dir <b>foo</b>
       at one of the paths.

       The <b>mp.module_paths</b> array is empty by default except for scripts which are loaded as a directory where it
       contains  one item - <b>&lt;directory&gt;/modules/</b> .  The array may be updated from a script (or using custom init
       - see below) which will affect future calls to <b>require</b> for global  module  id's  which  are  not  already
       loaded/cached.

       No  <b>global</b>  variable,  but a module's <b>this</b> at its top lexical scope is the global object - also in strict
       mode. If you have a module which needs <b>global</b> as the global object, you  could  do  <b>this.global</b>  <b>=</b>  <b>this;</b>
       before <b>require</b>.

       Functions and variables declared at a module don't pollute the global object.

   <b>Custom</b> <b>initialization</b>
       After  mpv  initializes the JavaScript environment for a script but before it loads the script - it tries
       to run the file <b>init.js</b> at the root of the mpv configuration directory. Code at this file can update  the
       environment further for all scripts. E.g. if it contains <b>mp.module_paths.push("/foo")</b> then <b>require</b> at all
       scripts  will  search global module id's also at <b>/foo</b> (do NOT do <b>mp.module_paths</b> <b>=</b> <b>["/foo"];</b> because this
       will remove existing paths - like <b>&lt;script-dir&gt;/modules</b> for scripts which load from a directory).

       The custom-init file is ignored if mpv is invoked with <b>--no-config</b>.

       Before mpv 0.34, the file name was <b>.init.js</b> (with dot) at the same dir.

   <b>The</b> <b>event</b> <b>loop</b>
       The event loop poll/dispatch mpv events as long as the queue is not empty,  then  processes  the  timers,
       then waits for the next event, and repeats this forever.

       You  could  put  this  code at your script to replace the built-in event loop, and also print every event
       which mpv sends to your script:

          function mp_event_loop() {
              var wait = 0;
              do {
                  var e = mp.wait_event(wait);
                  dump(e);  // there could be a lot of prints...
                  if (e.event != "none") {
                      mp.dispatch_event(e);
                      wait = 0;
                  } else {
                      wait = mp.process_timers() / 1000;
                      if (wait != 0) {
                          mp.notify_idle_observers();
                          wait = mp.peek_timers_wait() / 1000;
                      }
                  }
              } while (mp.keep_running);
          }

       <b>mp_event_loop</b> is a name which mpv tries to call after the script loads.  The internal  implementation  is
       similar to this (without <b>dump</b> though..).

       <b>e</b> <b>=</b> <b>mp.wait_event(wait)</b> returns when the next mpv event arrives, or after <b>wait</b> seconds if positive and no
       mpv events arrived. <b>wait</b> value of 0 returns immediately (with <b>e.event</b> <b>==</b> <b>"none"</b> if the queue is empty).

       <b>mp.dispatch_event(e)</b>  calls  back the handlers registered for <b>e.event</b>, if there are such (event handlers,
       property observers, script messages, etc).

       <b>mp.process_timers()</b> calls back the already-added, non-canceled due timers, and returns the duration in ms
       till the next due timer (possibly 0), or  -1  if  there  are  no  pending  timers.  Must  not  be  called
       recursively.

       <b>mp.notify_idle_observers()</b>  calls back the idle observers, which we do when we're about to sleep (wait !=
       0), but the observers may add timers or take non-negligible duration to complete, so we re-calculate <b>wait</b>
       afterwards.

       <b>mp.peek_timers_wait()</b> returns the same values as <b>mp.process_timers()</b> but without doing anything.  Invalid
       result if called from a timer callback.

       Note:   <b>exit()</b>  is  also  registered  for  the  <b>shutdown</b>  event,  and  its  implementation  is  a  simple
       <b>mp.keep_running</b> <b>=</b> <b>false</b>.

</pre><h4><b>JSON</b> <b>IPC</b></h4><pre>
       mpv can be controlled by external programs using the JSON-based IPC  protocol.   It  can  be  enabled  by
       specifying  the  path  to  a unix socket or a named pipe using the option <b>--input-ipc-server</b>, or the file
       descriptor number of a unix socket or a named pipe using <b>--input-ipc-client</b>.  Clients can connect to this
       socket and send commands to the player or receive events from it.

       <b>WARNING:</b>
          This is not intended to be a  secure  network  protocol.  It  is  explicitly  insecure:  there  is  no
          authentication,  no  encryption,  and  the  commands themselves are insecure too. For example, the <b>run</b>
          command is exposed, which can run arbitrary system commands. The use-case is  controlling  the  player
          locally. This is not different from the MPlayer slave protocol.

   <b>Socat</b> <b>example</b>
       You  can  use  the  <b>socat</b>  tool  to  send commands (and receive replies) from the shell. Assuming mpv was
       started with:

          mpv file.mkv --input-ipc-server=/tmp/mpvsocket

       Then you can control it using socat:

          &gt; echo '{ "command": ["get_property", "playback-time"] }' | socat - /tmp/mpvsocket
          {"data":190.482000,"error":"success"}

       In this case, socat copies data between stdin/stdout and the mpv socket connection.

       See the <b>--idle</b> option how to make mpv start without exiting immediately or playing a file.

       It's also possible to send input.conf style text-only commands:

          &gt; echo 'show-text ${playback-time}' | socat - /tmp/mpvsocket

       But you won't get a reply over the socket. (This particular  command  shows  the  playback  time  on  the
       player's OSD.)

   <b>Command</b> <b>Prompt</b> <b>example</b>
       Unfortunately,  it's  not  as  easy to test the IPC protocol on Windows, since Windows ports of socat (in
       Cygwin and MSYS2) don't understand named pipes. In the absence of a simple tool to send and receive  from
       bidirectional  pipes,  the  <b>echo</b>  command  can be used to send commands, but not receive replies from the
       command prompt.

       Assuming mpv was started with:

          mpv file.mkv --input-ipc-server=\\.\pipe\mpvsocket

       You can send commands from a command prompt:

          echo show-text ${playback-time} &gt;\\.\pipe\mpvsocket

       To be able to simultaneously read and write from the IPC pipe, like on Linux, it's necessary to write  an
       external program that uses overlapped file I/O (or some wrapper like .NET's NamedPipeClientStream.)

       You  can open the pipe in PuTTY as "serial" device. This is not very comfortable, but gives a way to test
       interactively without having to write code.

   <b>Protocol</b>
       The protocol uses UTF-8-only JSON as defined by RFC-8259. Unlike standard JSON, "u" escape sequences  are
       not  allowed  to  construct  surrogate  pairs.  To  avoid  getting  conflicts, encode all text characters
       including and above codepoint U+0020 as UTF-8. mpv might output broken UTF-8 in corner cases (see "UTF-8"
       section below).

       Clients can execute commands on the player by sending JSON messages of the following form:

          { "command": ["command_name", "param1", "param2", ...] }

       where <b>command_name</b> is the name of the  command  to  be  executed,  followed  by  a  list  of  parameters.
       Parameters must be formatted as native JSON values (integers, strings, booleans, ...). Every message <b>must</b>
       be  terminated  with  <b>\n</b>.  Additionally, <b>\n</b> must not appear anywhere inside the message. In practice this
       means that messages should be minified before being sent to mpv.

       mpv will then send back a reply indicating whether the command was run correctly, and an additional field
       holding the command-specific return data (it can also be null).

          { "error": "success", "data": null }

       mpv will also send events to clients with JSON messages of the following form:

          { "event": "event_name" }

       where <b>event_name</b> is the name of the event. Additional event-specific fields can also be present. See List
       of events for a list of all supported events.

       Because events can occur at any time, it may be difficult at times to determine which response goes  with
       which  command.  Commands  may optionally include a <b>request_id</b> which, if provided in the command request,
       will be copied verbatim into the response. mpv does not interpret the <b>request_id</b> in any way; it is solely
       for the use of the requester. The only requirement is that the <b>request_id</b> field must  be  an  integer  (a
       number  without  fractional  parts  in the range <b>-2^63..2^63-1</b>). Using other types is deprecated and will
       currently show a warning. In the future, this will raise an error.

       For example, this request:

          { "command": ["get_property", "time-pos"], "request_id": 100 }

       Would generate this response:

          { "error": "success", "data": 1.468135, "request_id": 100 }

       If you don't specify a <b>request_id</b>, command replies will set it to 0.

       All commands, replies, and events are separated from each other with a line break character (<b>\n</b>).

       If the first character (after skipping whitespace) is not <b>{</b>, the command will be interpreted as  non-JSON
       text  command,  as they are used in input.conf (or <b>mpv_command_string()</b> in the client API). Additionally,
       lines starting with <b>#</b> and empty lines are ignored.

       Currently, embedded 0 bytes terminate the current line, but you should not rely on this.

   <b>Data</b> <b>flow</b>
       Currently, the mpv-side IPC implementation does not service the socket while a command  is  executed  and
       the  reply  is  written.  It  is  for  example  not  possible that other events, that happened during the
       execution of the command, are written to the socket before the reply is written.

       This might change in the future. The only guarantee is that replies to IPC messages are sent in sequence.

       Also, since socket I/O is inherently asynchronous, it is possible that you read unrelated event  messages
       from  the  socket, before you read the reply to the previous command you sent. In this case, these events
       were queued by the mpv side before it read and started processing your command message.

       If the mpv-side IPC implementation switches away from blocking writes and blocking command execution,  it
       may attempt to send events at any time.

       You  can  also  use  asynchronous  commands,  which  can  return in any order, and which do not block IPC
       protocol interaction at all while the command is executed in the background.

   <b>Asynchronous</b> <b>commands</b>
       Command can be run asynchronously. This behaves exactly as with normal  command  execution,  except  that
       execution is not blocking. Other commands can be sent while it's executing, and command completion can be
       arbitrarily reordered.

       The <b>async</b> field controls this. If present, it must be a boolean. If missing, <b>false</b> is assumed.

       For example, this initiates an asynchronous command:

          { "command": ["screenshot"], "request_id": 123, "async": true }

       And this is the completion:

          {"request_id":123,"error":"success","data":null}

       By  design,  you  will not get a confirmation that the command was started. If a command is long running,
       sending the message will not lead to any reply until much later when the command finishes.

       Some commands execute synchronously, but these will  behave  like  asynchronous  commands  that  finished
       execution immediately.

       Cancellation of asynchronous commands is available in the libmpv API, but has not yet been implemented in
       the IPC protocol.

   <b>Commands</b> <b>with</b> <b>named</b> <b>arguments</b>
       If  the  <b>command</b>  field  is  a  JSON object, named arguments are expected. This is described in the C API
       <b>mpv_command_node()</b> documentation (the <b>MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP</b> case). In some cases, this  may  make  commands
       more readable, while some obscure commands basically require using named arguments.

       Currently, only "proper" commands (as listed by List of Input Commands) support named arguments.

   <b>Commands</b>
       In addition to the commands described in List of Input Commands, a few extra commands can also be used as
       part of the protocol:

       <b>client_name</b>
              Return the name of the client as string. This is the string <b>ipc-N</b> with N being an integer number.

       <b>get_time_us</b>
              Return  the  current  mpv  internal time in microseconds as a number. This is basically the system
              time, with an arbitrary offset.

       <b>get_property</b>
              Return the value of the given property. The value will be sent in the data  field  of  the  replay
              message.

              Example:

                 { "command": ["get_property", "volume"] }
                 { "data": 50.0, "error": "success" }

       <b>get_property_string</b>
              Like <b>get_property</b>, but the resulting data will always be a string.

              Example:

                 { "command": ["get_property_string", "volume"] }
                 { "data": "50.000000", "error": "success" }

       <b>set_property</b>
              Set the given property to the given value. See Properties for more information about properties.

              Example:

                 { "command": ["set_property", "pause", true] }
                 { "error": "success" }

       <b>set_property_string</b>
              Alias for <b>set_property</b>. Both commands accept native values and strings.

       <b>observe_property</b>
              Watch  a  property  for  changes.  If  the  given  property  is  changed,  then  an  event of type
              <b>property-change</b> will be generated

              Example:

                 { "command": ["observe_property", 1, "volume"] }
                 { "error": "success" }
                 { "event": "property-change", "id": 1, "data": 52.0, "name": "volume" }

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 If the connection is  closed,  the  IPC  client  is  destroyed  internally,  and  the  observed
                 properties  are  unregistered.  This happens for example when sending commands to a socket with
                 separate <b>socat</b> invocations.  This can make it seem like property observation does not work. You
                 must keep the IPC connection open to make it work.

       <b>observe_property_string</b>
              Like <b>observe_property</b>, but the resulting data will always be a string.

              Example:

                 { "command": ["observe_property_string", 1, "volume"] }
                 { "error": "success" }
                 { "event": "property-change", "id": 1, "data": "52.000000", "name": "volume" }

       <b>unobserve_property</b>
              Undo <b>observe_property</b> or <b>observe_property_string</b>. This requires  the  numeric  id  passed  to  the
              observed command as argument.

              Example:

                 { "command": ["unobserve_property", 1] }
                 { "error": "success" }

       <b>request_log_messages</b>
              Enable  output of mpv log messages. They will be received as events. The parameter to this command
              is the log-level (see <b>mpv_request_log_messages</b> C API function).

              Log message output is meant for humans  only  (mostly  for  debugging).   Attempting  to  retrieve
              information  by  parsing  these  messages  will  just  lead to breakages with future mpv releases.
              Instead, make a feature request, and ask for a proper event that returns the information you need.

       <b>enable_event,</b> <b>disable_event</b>
              Enables or disables the named event. Mirrors the <b>mpv_request_event</b> C API function. If  the  string
              <b>all</b> is used instead of an event name, all events are enabled or disabled.

              By default, most events are enabled, and there is not much use for this command.

       <b>get_version</b>
              Returns the client API version the C API of the remote mpv instance provides.

              See also: <b>DOCS/client-api-changes.rst</b>.

   <b>UTF-8</b>
       Normally,  all  strings  are  in  UTF-8. Sometimes it can happen that strings are in some broken encoding
       (often happens with file tags and such, and filenames on many Unixes are not  required  to  be  in  UTF-8
       either).  This  means  that  mpv  sometimes  sends  invalid  JSON.  If  that  is a problem for the client
       application's parser, it should filter the raw data for invalid UTF-8 sequences and perform  the  desired
       replacement, before feeding the data to its JSON parser.

       mpv will not attempt to construct invalid UTF-8 with broken "u" escape sequences. This includes surrogate
       pairs.

   <b>JSON</b> <b>extensions</b>
       The following non-standard extensions are supported:

          • a list or object item can have a trailing ","

          • object syntax accepts "=" in addition of ":"

          • object keys can be unquoted, if they start with a character in "A-Za-z_" and contain only characters
            in "A-Za-z0-9_"

          • byte escapes with "xAB" are allowed (with AB being a 2 digit hex number)

       Example:

          { objkey = "value\x0A" }

       Is equivalent to:

          { "objkey": "value\n" }

   <b>Alternative</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>starting</b> <b>clients</b>
       You  can  create  an  anonymous IPC connection without having to set <b>--input-ipc-server</b>. This is achieved
       through a mpv pseudo scripting backend that starts processes.

       You can put <b>.run</b> file extension in the mpv scripts directory in its   config  directory  (see  the  FILES
       section  for  details),  or load them through other means (see Script location). These scripts are simply
       executed with the OS native mechanism (as if you ran them in the shell). They must have a proper  shebang
       and have the executable bit set.

       When  executed,  a socket (the IPC connection) is passed to them through file descriptor inheritance. The
       file descriptor is indicated as the special command line argument <b>--mpv-ipc-fd=N</b>, where <b>N</b> is the  numeric
       file descriptor.

       The  rest is the same as with a normal <b>--input-ipc-server</b> IPC connection. mpv does not attempt to observe
       or other interact with the started script process.

       This does not work in Windows yet.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGELOG</b></h4><pre>
       There is no real changelog, but you can look at the following things:

       • The release changelog, which should contain most user-visible changes, including new features  and  bug
         fixes:

          &lt;https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/releases&gt;

       • The git log, which is the "real" changelog

       • The  file  &lt;https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/DOCS/interface-changes.rst&gt; documents changes
         to the command and user interface, such as options and properties.

       • C API changes are listed in
          &lt;https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/DOCS/client-api-changes.rst&gt;

       • The file <b>mplayer-changes.rst</b> in the <b>DOCS</b> sub directory on the git repository, which used to be in place
         of this section. It documents some changes that  happened  since  mplayer2  forked  off  MPlayer.  (Not
         updated anymore.)

</pre><h4><b>EMBEDDING</b> <b>INTO</b> <b>OTHER</b> <b>PROGRAMS</b> <b>(LIBMPV)</b></h4><pre>
       mpv  can be embedded into other programs as video/audio playback backend. The recommended way to do so is
       using libmpv. See <b>include/mpv/client.h</b> in the mpv source code repository. This provides a C API. Bindings
       for other languages might be available (see wiki).

       Since libmpv merely allows access to underlying mechanisms that can control mpv, further documentation is
       spread over a few places:

</pre><h4><b>C</b> <b>PLUGINS</b></h4><pre>
       You can write C plugins for mpv. These use the libmpv API, although they do not use  the  libmpv  library
       itself.

       They  are enabled by default if compiler supports linking with the <b>-rdynamic</b> flag on Linux/BSD platforms.
       On Windows the are always enabled.

   <b>C</b> <b>plugins</b> <b>location</b>
       C plugins are put into the mpv scripts directory in its config  directory  (see  the  FILES  section  for
       details).  They  must  have  a  <b>.so</b>  or  <b>.dll</b> file extension. They can also be explicitly loaded with the
       <b>--script</b> option.

   <b>API</b>
       A C plugin must export the following function:

          int mpv_open_cplugin(mpv_handle *handle)

       The plugin function will be called on loading time. This function does not return as long as your  plugin
       is  loaded  (it  runs  in  its own thread). The <b>handle</b> will be deallocated as soon as the plugin function
       returns.

       The return value is interpreted as error status. A value of <b>0</b> is interpreted as success, while <b>-1</b> signals
       an error. In the latter case, the player prints an uninformative error message that loading failed.

       Return values other than <b>0</b> and <b>-1</b> are reserved, and trigger undefined behavior.

       Within  the  plugin  function,  you  can  call  libmpv  API  functions.  The   <b>handle</b>   is   created   by
       <b>mpv_create_client()</b>   (or   actually   an  internal  equivalent),  and  belongs  to  you.  You  can  call
       <b>mpv_wait_event()</b> to wait for things happening, and so on.

       Note that the player might block until your plugin calls <b>mpv_wait_event()</b> for the first time. This  gives
       you a chance to install initial hooks etc.  before playback begins.

       The details are quite similar to Lua scripts.

   <b>Linkage</b> <b>to</b> <b>libmpv</b>
       The  current  implementation  requires that your plugins are <b>not</b> linked against libmpv. What your plugins
       use are not symbols from a libmpv binary, but symbols from the mpv host binary.

       On Windows to make symbols from the host binary available, you  have  to  define  MPV_CPLUGIN_DYNAMIC_SYM
       when compiling cplugin. This will load symbols dynamically, before calling <b>mpv_open_cplugin()</b>.

   <b>Examples</b>
       See:

       •
          &lt;https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv-examples/tree/master/cplugins&gt;

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       There are a number of environment variables that can be used to control the behavior of mpv.

       <b>HOME,</b> <b>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</b>
              Used to determine mpv config directory. If <b>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</b> is not set, <b>$HOME/.config/mpv</b> is used.

              <b>$HOME/.mpv</b> is always added to the list of config search paths with a lower priority.

       <b>MPV_HOME</b>
              Directory  where  mpv looks for user settings. Overrides <b>HOME</b>, and mpv will try to load the config
              file as <b>$MPV_HOME/mpv.conf</b>.

       <b>MPV_VERBOSE</b> <b>(see</b> <b>also</b> <b>-v</b> <b>and</b> <b>--msg-level)</b>
              Set the initial verbosity level across all message modules (default: 0).  This is an integer,  and
              the resulting verbosity corresponds to the number of <b>--v</b> options passed to the command line.

       <b>MPV_LEAK_REPORT</b>
              If  set  to  <b>1</b>,  enable  internal  talloc  leak  reporting.  If set to another value, disable leak
              reporting.

       <b>LADSPA_PATH</b>
              Specifies the search path for LADSPA plugins. If it is unset, fully qualified path names  must  be
              used.

       <b>DISPLAY</b>
              Standard X11 display name to use.

       <b>FFmpeg:</b>
              This  library  accesses various environment variables. However, they are not centrally documented,
              and documenting them is not our job. Therefore, this list is incomplete.

              Notable environment variables:

              <b>http_proxy</b>
                     URL to proxy for <b>http://</b> and <b>https://</b> URLs.

              <b>no_proxy</b>
                     List of domain patterns for which no proxy should be used.  List entries are  separated  by
                     <b>,</b>. Patterns can include <b>*</b>.

       <b>libdvdcss:</b>

              <b>DVDCSS_CACHE</b>
                     Specify  a directory in which to store title key values. This will speed up descrambling of
                     DVDs which are in the cache. The <b>DVDCSS_CACHE</b> directory is created if it  does  not  exist,
                     and  a  subdirectory  is  created  named  after  the  DVD's title or manufacturing date. If
                     <b>DVDCSS_CACHE</b> is not set or is  empty,  libdvdcss  will  use  the  default  value  which  is
                     <b>${HOME}/.dvdcss/</b>  under  Unix  and the roaming application data directory (<b>%APPDATA%</b>) under
                     Windows. The special value "off" disables caching.

              <b>DVDCSS_METHOD</b>
                     Sets the authentication and decryption method that libdvdcss will  use  to  read  scrambled
                     discs. Can be one of <b>title</b>, <b>key</b> or <b>disc</b>.

                     <b>key</b>    is  the default method. libdvdcss will use a set of calculated player keys to try to
                            get the disc key. This can fail if the drive does not recognize any  of  the  player
                            keys.

                     <b>disc</b>   is  a  fallback  method when key has failed. Instead of using player keys, libdvdcss
                            will crack the disc key using a brute force algorithm. This process is CPU intensive
                            and requires 64 MB of memory to store temporary data.

                     <b>title</b>  is the fallback when all other methods have failed.  It  does  not  rely  on  a  key
                            exchange with the DVD drive, but rather uses a crypto attack to guess the title key.
                            On  rare  cases this may fail because there is not enough encrypted data on the disc
                            to perform a statistical attack, but on the other hand it is the only way to decrypt
                            a DVD stored on a hard disc, or a DVD with the wrong region on an RPC2 drive.

              <b>DVDCSS_RAW_DEVICE</b>
                     Specify the raw device to use. Exact usage will depend on your operating system, the  Linux
                     utility  to  set  up raw devices is <a href="../man8/raw.8.html">raw</a>(8) for instance. Please note that on most operating
                     systems, using a raw device requires highly aligned buffers: Linux requires  a  2048  bytes
                     alignment (which is the size of a DVD sector).

              <b>DVDCSS_VERBOSE</b>
                     Sets the libdvdcss verbosity level.

                     <b>0</b>      Outputs no messages at all.

                     <b>1</b>      Outputs error messages to stderr.

                     <b>2</b>      Outputs error messages and debug messages to stderr.

              <b>DVDREAD_NOKEYS</b>
                     Skip retrieving all keys on startup. Currently disabled.

              <b>HOME</b>   FIXME: Document this.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       Normally  <b>mpv</b>  returns  0  as  exit  code  after  finishing playback successfully.  If errors happen, the
       following exit codes can be returned:

          <b>1</b>      Error initializing mpv. This is also returned if unknown options are passed to mpv.

          <b>2</b>      The file passed to mpv couldn't be played. This is somewhat fuzzy:  currently,  playback  of  a
                 file  is  considered to be successful if initialization was mostly successful, even if playback
                 fails immediately after initialization.

          <b>3</b>      There were some files that could be played, and some files which couldn't (using the definition
                 of success from above).

          <b>4</b>      Quit due to a signal, Ctrl+c in a VO window (by default), or from the default quit key bindings
                 in encoding mode.

       Note that quitting the player manually will always lead to exit code 0, overriding  the  exit  code  that
       would  be  returned normally. Also, the <b>quit</b> input command can take an exit code: in this case, that exit
       code is returned.

</pre><h4><b>OPTICAL</b> <b>DRIVES</b></h4><pre>
       Depending on the OS, mpv will choose a different disc device by default.  This applies  for  all  optical
       disc playback (CDDA, DVD, and BD).

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Note  that  this  section  assumes  Linux/BSD.  On  other  platforms  the  paths  may  be different.  For
       Windows-specifics, see FILES ON WINDOWS section.

       All configuration files should be encoded in UTF-8.

       <b>/usr/local/etc/mpv/mpv.conf</b>
              mpv system-wide settings (depends on <b>--prefix</b> passed to configure - mpv in  default  configuration
              will  use  <b>/usr/local/etc/mpv/</b>  as config directory, while most Linux distributions will set it to
              <b>/etc/mpv/</b>).

       <b><a href="file:~/.cache/mpv">~/.cache/mpv</a></b>
              The standard cache directory. Certain options within mpv may cause it  to  write  cache  files  to
              disk. This can be overridden by environment variables, in ascending order:

              <b>1</b>      If <b>$XDG_CACHE_HOME</b> is set, then the derived cache directory will be <b>$XDG_CACHE_HOME/mpv</b>.

              <b>2</b>      If <b>$MPV_HOME</b> is set, then the derived cache directory will be <b>$MPV_HOME</b>.

              If the directory does not exist, mpv will try to create it automatically.

       <b><a href="file:~/.config/mpv">~/.config/mpv</a></b>
              The  standard  configuration  directory.  This  can  be  overridden  by  environment variables, in
              ascending order:

              <b>1</b>      If  <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</b>  is  set,  then  the   derived   configuration   directory   will   be
                     <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mpv</b>.

              <b>2</b>      If <b>$MPV_HOME</b> is set, then the derived configuration directory will be <b>$MPV_HOME</b>.

              If this directory, nor the original configuration directory (see below) do not exist, mpv tries to
              create this directory automatically.

       <b><a href="file:~/.mpv/">~/.mpv/</a></b>
              The  original (pre 0.5.0) configuration directory. It will continue to be read if present. If this
              directory is present and the standard configuration directory is not present, then cache files and
              watch later config files will also be written to this directory.

              If both this directory and the standard configuration directory are present, configuration will be
              read from both with the standard configuration directory content taking precedence.  However,  you
              should fully migrate to the standard directory and a warning will be shown in this situation.

       <b><a href="file:~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf">~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf</a></b>
              mpv user settings (see CONFIGURATION FILES section)

       <b><a href="file:~/.config/mpv/input.conf">~/.config/mpv/input.conf</a></b>
              key bindings (see INPUT.CONF section)

       <b><a href="file:~/.config/mpv/fonts.conf">~/.config/mpv/fonts.conf</a></b>
              Fontconfig  fonts.conf  that  is  customized for mpv. You should include system fonts.conf in this
              file or mpv would not know about fonts that you already have in the system.

              Only available when libass is built with fontconfig.

       <b><a href="file:~/.config/mpv/subfont.ttf">~/.config/mpv/subfont.ttf</a></b>
              fallback subtitle font

       <b><a href="file:~/.config/mpv/fonts/">~/.config/mpv/fonts/</a></b>
              Default location for <b>--sub-fonts-dir</b> (see Subtitles) and <b>--osd-fonts-dir</b> (see OSD).

       <b><a href="file:~/.config/mpv/scripts/">~/.config/mpv/scripts/</a></b>
              All files in this directory are loaded as if they were passed to the  <b>--script</b>  option.  They  are
              loaded in alphabetical order.

              The <b>--load-scripts=no</b> option disables loading these files.

              See Script location for details.

       <b><a href="file:~/.local/state/mpv/watch_later/">~/.local/state/mpv/watch_later/</a></b>
              Contains  temporary  config  files  needed  for  resuming  playback  of files with the watch later
              feature. See for example the <b>Q</b> key binding, or the <b>quit-watch-later</b> input command.

              This can be overridden by environment variables, in ascending order:

              <b>1</b>      If  <b>$XDG_STATE_HOME</b>  is  set,  then   the   derived   watch   later   directory   will   be
                     <b>$XDG_STATE_HOME/mpv/watch_later</b>.

              <b>2</b>      If <b>$MPV_HOME</b> is set, then the derived watch later directory will be <b>$MPV_HOME/watch_later</b>.

              Each  file  is  a  small config file which is loaded if the corresponding media file is loaded. It
              contains the playback position and some (not necessarily all) settings that  were  changed  during
              playback.  The  filenames  are  hashed from the full paths of the media files. It's in general not
              possible  to  extract  the  media  filename  from  this   hash.   However,   you   can   set   the
              <b>--write-filename-in-watch-later-config</b>  option,  and the player will add the media filename to the
              contents of the resume config file.

       <b><a href="file:~/.config/mpv/script-opts/osc.conf">~/.config/mpv/script-opts/osc.conf</a></b>
              This is loaded by the OSC script. See the ON SCREEN CONTROLLER docs for details.

              Other files in this directory are specific to the corresponding scripts as well, and the mpv  core
              doesn't touch them.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b> <b>ON</b> <b>WINDOWS</b></h4><pre>
       On  win32 (if compiled with MinGW, but not Cygwin), the default config file locations are different. They
       are generally located under <b>%APPDATA%/mpv/</b>.  For example, the path to mpv.conf is <b>%APPDATA%/mpv/mpv.conf</b>,
       which maps to a system and user-specific path, for example
          <b>C:\users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\mpv\mpv.conf</b>

       You can find the exact path by running <b>echo</b> <b>%APPDATA%\mpv\mpv.conf</b> in cmd.exe.

       Other config files (such as <b>input.conf</b>) are in the same directory. See the FILES section above.

       The cache directory is located at <b>%LOCALAPPDATA%/mpv/cache</b>.

       The watch_later directory is located at <b>%LOCALAPPDATA%/mpv/watch_later</b>.

       The environment variable <b>$MPV_HOME</b> completely overrides these, like on UNIX.

       If a directory named <b>portable_config</b> next to the mpv.exe exists, all config  will  be  loaded  from  this
       directory  only.  Watch  later  config files and cache files are written to this directory as well. (This
       exists on Windows only and is  redundant  with  <b>$MPV_HOME</b>.  However,  since  Windows  is  very  scripting
       unfriendly,  a  wrapper script just setting <b>$MPV_HOME</b>, like you could do it on other systems, won't work.
       <b>portable_config</b> is provided for convenience to get around this restriction.)

       Config files located in the same directory as <b>mpv.exe</b> are loaded with lower priority. Some  config  files
       are loaded only once, which means that e.g. of 2 <b>input.conf</b> files located in two config directories, only
       the one from the directory with higher priority will be loaded.

       A  third  config  directory  with the lowest priority is the directory named <b>mpv</b> in the same directory as
       <b>mpv.exe</b>. This used to be the directory with the highest priority, but is now discouraged to use and might
       be removed in the future.

       Note that mpv likes to mix <b>/</b> and <b>\</b> path  separators  for  simplicity.   kernel32.dll  accepts  this,  but
       cmd.exe does not.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b> <b>ON</b> <b>MACOS</b></h4><pre>
       On  macOS  the  watch later directory is located at <b><a href="file:~/.config/mpv/watch_later/">~/.config/mpv/watch_later/</a></b> and the cache directory is
       set to <b><a href="file:~/Library/Caches/io.mpv/">~/Library/Caches/io.mpv/</a></b>.  These  directories  can't  be  overwritten  by  environment  variables.
       Everything else is the same as FILES.

</pre><h4><b>COPYRIGHT</b></h4><pre>
