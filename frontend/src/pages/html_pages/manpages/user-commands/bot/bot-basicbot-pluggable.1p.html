</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       bot-basicbot-pluggable - A standard Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable script

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.30

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This script acts as standard interface for Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable, a generic framework for writing
       pluggable IRC bots in perl.  It enables the user to administrate a full-fledged bot without writing any
       perl code.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         bot-basicbot-pluggable --nick MyBot --server irc.perl.org

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --server
           The server to connect to. Defaults to <u>localhost</u>.

       --configfile FILE
           Read  config  options from specified FILE. For a discussion of possible value and format refer to the
           section CONFIGFILE. The default to read the configfile found by Config::Find.

       --logconfig FILE
           The  logging  configuration  will   be   read   from   the   specified   file.    Please   refer   to
           Log::Log4perl::Config  for  its  format.  The  parameter  loglevel will be ignored if this options is
           supplied.

       --loglevel LEVEL
           Sets the bots loglevel to one of the following levels in decreasing order of  output:  trace,  debug,
           info, warn, error or fatal. Defaults to warn.

       --nick NICKNAME
           Nickname to use. Defaults to <u>basicbot</u>.

       --channel CHANNELNAME
           Channel  to  connect to. This parameter may be provided several times.  You do not have to prefix the
           channel name with a hash symbol, which would have to be escaped in shell.  It's  automatically  added
           for you.

       --password
           Sets  the  admin  password  of the <u>Auth</u> module. This also loads the <u>Auth</u> module implicitly. Please be
           warned that this password will probably been seen on any process listing as on <u>ps</u> or <u>top</u>.

       --module
           Modules to load. This parameter may be provided several times. You can call --list-modules to  get  a
           list  of  all available modules. If you do not define any module via this option, <u>Auth</u> and <u>Loader</u> are
           loaded by default.

       --list-modules
           Lists all installed modules and exits afterwards. No bot is started.

       --list-stores
           Lists all installed storage modules and exits afterwards. No bot is started.

       --store
           Defines which storage module is used to save module settings. The default is <u>Memory</u>, which  does  not
           save any settings between sessions but does neither leave any files nor need any special settings.

           This  options  take  a string in the form <u>key</u>=<u>value</u> and can be specified multiple times. The value of
           the key <u>type</u> define which storage backend to load, all other parameters  are  passed  to  the  object
           constructor as hash reference.

           For example:

             ./bot --store type=Deep --store file=foo.deep

           That   command  will  create  an  Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Store::Deep  object  and  pass  "file  =&gt;
           'foo.deep'" to its constructor.

       --charset
           Charset to use for the bot. Defaults to <u>utf8</u>, but you can use any encoding listed in Encode. The  IRC
           protocol doesn't define a specific character-set to use.  This presents a big problem, because if you
           do not use the same as everybody else in the channel you just receive garbage.

       --port
           Port  to  connect  to  on target host. This defaults to the irc standard port 6667. You won't need to
           define this in most cases.

       --command-line
           The bot does not connect to any irc server, but will wait on stdin on commands from  the  user.  This
           mode won't actually work with a lot of irc related modules like ChanOp.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGFILE</b></h4><pre>
       The  bot read a configfile either found by Config::Find (usually named <a href="file:~/.bot-basicbot-pluggable.yaml">~/.bot-basicbot-pluggable.yaml</a>) or
       specified on the command line via <u>--configfile</u> on startup. The file should be a syntactical correct  yaml
       file  with  a  hash  as its first level element. It understands every option listed above and the special
       settings parameter, which is a hash, where the keys  are  module  names  and  the  value  is  a  hash  of
       configurable module settings. Easier to show than to explain:

        ---
        server: host
        nick: bot
        settings:
          Karma:
            self_ignore: 0
        store:
          type: Deep
          file: foo.deep

       All modules listed under settings are also loaded on startup.

       Please remember that you have to escape hash (or pound) signs in YAML:

        ---
        channel:
          - '#botzone'
