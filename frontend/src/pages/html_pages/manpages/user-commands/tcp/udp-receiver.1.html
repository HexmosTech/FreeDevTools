</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       udp-receiver - receive files broadcast by udp-sender

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       ./udp-receiver [--file <u>file</u>] [--pipe <u>pipe</u>] [--portbase <u>portbase</u>] [--interface <u>net-interface</u>] [--log <u>file</u>]
       [--ttl <u>time-to-live</u>] [--mcast-rdv-address <u>mcast-rdv-address</u>] [--nokbd] [--exitWait milliseconds]
       [--stat-period <u>n</u>] [--print-uncompressed-position <u>flag</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "Udp-receiver" is used to receive files sent by "udp-sender" (for instance a disk image).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Basic</b> <b>options</b>
       --file <u>file</u>
           Writes  received  data to <u>file</u>. If this parameter is not supplied, received data is written to stdout
           instead.

       --pipe <u>command</u>
           Sends data through <u>pipe</u> after receiving it. This is useful for decompressing the data, or for filling
           in unused filesystem blocks that may have been stripped out by udp-sender. The <u>command</u> gets a  direct
           handle  on  the  output file or device, and thus may seek inside it, if needed. "Udpcast" itself also
           keeps a handle on the file, which is used for an informational progress display. The <u>command</u>'s  stdin
           is a pipe from udp-receiver. Example: "udp-receiver -p "gzip -dc""

       --log <u>file</u>
           Logs some stuff into <u>file</u>.

       --nosync
           Do not open target in synchronous mode. This is the default when writing to a file or a pipe.

       --sync
           Write  to  target  in  synchronous  mode.  This is the default when writing to a device (character or
           block)

       --nokbd
           Do not read start signal from keyboard, and do not display any message telling the user to press  any
           key to start.

       --start-timeout <u>sec</u>
           receiver aborts at start if it doesn't see a sender within this many seconds. Furthermore, the sender
           needs  to  start transmission of data within this delay. Once transmission is started, the timeout no
           longer applies.

       --receive-timeout <u>sec</u>
           receiver aborts during transmission if it doesn't see a packet  from  the  sender  within  this  many
           seconds. This timeout only applies once transmission has started.

   <b>Networking</b> <b>options</b>
       --portbase <u>portbase</u>
           Default  ports  to use for udpcast. Two ports are used: <u>portbase</u> and <u>portbase+1</u> . Thus, <u>Portbase</u> must
           be  even.  Default  is  9000.  The  same  <u>portbase</u>  must  be  specified  for  both  "udp-sender"  and
           "udp-receiver".

       --interface <u>interface</u>
           Network interface used to send out the data. Default is "eth0"

       --ttl <u>ttl</u>
           Time  to  live for connection request packet (by default connection request is broadcast to the LAN's
           broadcast address. If ttl is set, the connection request is multicast instead to 224.0.0.1  with  the
           given ttl, which should enable udpcast to work between LANs. Not tested though.

       --mcast-rdv-address <u>address</u>
           Uses  a  non-standard  multicast  address for the control connection (which is used by the sender and
           receivers to "find" each other). This is <b>not</b> the address that  is  used  to  transfer  the  data.  By
           default "mcast-rdv-address" is the Ethernet broadcast address if "ttl" is 1, and 224.0.0.1 otherwise.
           This  setting  should not be used except in very special situations, such as when 224.0.0.1 cannot be
           used for policy reasons.

       --exit-wait <u>milliseconds</u>
           When transmission is over, receiver will wait for this time after receiving the final REQACK. This is
           done in order to guard against loss of the final ACK. Is 500 milliseconds by default.

       --ignore-lost-data
           Do not stop reception when data loss is detected, but instead fill with random data. This  is  useful
           for multimedia transmission where 100% integrity is not need.

   <b>Statistics</b> <b>options</b>
       --stat-period <u>seconds</u>
           Every  so  much  milliseconds,  print  some statistics to stderr: how much bytes received so far log,
           position in uncompressed file (if applicable), overall bitrate... By default, this is  printed  every
           half second.

       --print-uncompressed-position <u>flag</u>
           By  default, udp-receiver only prints the position in uncompressed file if the 2 following conditions
           are met:

           •   Output is piped via a compressor ("-p " option).

           •   The final output is seekable (file or device)

           With the "--print-uncompressed-position", options, you can change this behavior:

           •   If flag is 0, uncompressed position will <b>never</b> be printed, even if above conditions are met

           •   If flag is 1, uncompressed position will <b>always</b> be printed, even if above conditions are <b>not</b> met
