       sympathy - client/server terminal emulator with logging

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sympathy</b> <b>-t</b> [ <u>terminal_options</u> ] [ <u>display_options</u> ]
       <b>sympathy</b> <b>-s</b> [ <u>terminal_options</u> ] [ <u>server_options</u> ]

       <b>sympathy</b> <b>-v</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Sympathy</u>  is a replacement for <a href="../man1/screen.1.html">screen</a>(1), <a href="../man1/minicom.1.html">minicom</a>(1) and <a href="../man1/consolidate.1.html">consolidate</a>(1). It is a VT52/VT100/ANSI terminal
       emulator with some special features. In normal use <u>sympathy</u> would sit between a terminal device (a serial
       port or a pseudo-tty) and the user's usual terminal emulator (eg <a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a>(1)).  <u>Sympathy</u> renders  data  from
       the  terminal device into an internal frame buffer and then expresses changes in this frame buffer to the
       outer terminal emulator using a small subset of ANSI  escape  codes.   <u>Sympathy</u>  always  generates  valid
       escape  codes  to  the outer terminal, and will reset the state of its internal terminal emulator when it
       detects receive errors on the terminal device.

       <u>Sympathy</u>, unlike <a href="../man1/screen.1.html">screen</a>(1), takes care to  preserve  the  scroll-back  features  of  the  outer  terminal
       emulator:  lines  that  scroll  off  the top of the internal frame buffer are scrolled off the top of the
       outer terminal emulator. When <u>sympathy</u> is used in client/server mode, some history is added to the  outer
       terminal emulator when the client connects.

       <u>Sympathy</u>  also  supports  automatic  baud-rate  detection,  and advanced logging features.  <u>Sympathy</u> logs
       whenever any of the modem control lines change state, receive errors, and the contents of any line on the
       frame buffer as the cursor moves off it.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>major</u> <u>mode</u> <u>options</u><b>:</b>

       <b>-C</b>   clear lock files <u>sympathy</u> will remove inactive lockfiles for the specified serial device,  and  then
            exit.

       <b>-c</b> or <b>-r</b> <u>id</u>
            act  as client only: <u>sympathy</u> connects to a <u>sympathy</u> server process and injects the history into the
            outer terminal emulator, and connects the user with the terminal  device.  One  server  process  can
            support multiple client processes. This mode can also be used to obtain a dump of the current screen
            in HTML format (see the -<b>H</b> option), inject key-presses (see -<b>I</b>) or allow control via a dumb terminal
            (see -<b>N</b>).  The -<b>r</b> option connects to a server process socket called <u>id</u>, or if <u>id</u> is an integer <u>host-</u>
            <u>name</u>.<u>id</u>  mimicking  the  behaviour  of <a href="../man1/screen.1.html">screen</a>(1).  <u>Sympathy</u> searches for the socket in the following
            directories: <u><a href="file:~/.sympathy">~/.sympathy</a></u>, <u><a href="file:~/sympathy">~/sympathy</a></u>, <u>/etc/sympathy</u>, <u>/var/sympathy</u>.  With the -<b>c</b> option  the  socket
            must be specified with the -<b>k</b> option.

       [ <b>-c</b> <b>-s</b> ]
            act  as both client and server: <u>sympathy</u> forks. The child process becomes a server, and the original
            process becomes a client which then connects to the server. This is the default  major  mode  if  no
            other  is  specified.   Since  the default terminal device is a pseudo-tty, running <u>sympathy</u> with no
            arguments will start a new shell in a daemonised process and connect to it  as  a  client  from  the
            original process, mimicking the behaviour of <a href="../man1/screen.1.html">screen</a>(1)

       <b>-l</b> or <b>-ls</b>
            show active sockets: <u>sympathy</u> will show active sockets, ones to which a call to <a href="../man2/connect.2.html">connect</a>(2) succeeds,
            in  <a href="file:~/.sympathy.">~/.sympathy.</a>  If  the  socket  name  begins  with  the host-name of the machine, and the call to
            <a href="../man2/connect.2.html">connect</a>(2) fails, then socket will be unlinked.

       <b>-s</b>   act as server only: <u>sympathy</u> opens the terminal device and renders into an  internal  frame  buffer,
            listens  for  clients on the socket and logs activity. By default the server will fork into a daemon
            process but can be forced to remain in the foreground with the -<b>F</b> option.

       <b>-t</b>   act as terminal emulator only: <u>sympathy</u> opens  the  terminal  device  and  outputs  into  the  outer
            terminal  emulator.  When  <u>sympathy</u>  <u>exits</u> <u>the</u> device is closed and no process remains. In this mode
            <u>sympathy</u> behaves like a traditional terminal emulator such as <a href="../man1/cu.1.html">cu</a>(1) or <a href="../man1/minicom.1.html">minicom</a>(1).

       <b>-v</b>   show current version: <u>sympathy</u> will print the the version number of the code it was compiled from.

       <b>-h</b>   show help: <u>sympathy</u> will show brief usage instructions

       <u>terminal_options</u><b>:</b>

       <b>-d</b> <u>serialdev</u>
            connect to terminal device <u>serialdev</u>, eg /dev/ttyS0.  By default <u>sympathy</u> doesn't lock the  terminal
            device,  but checks periodically for lock files of other processes. If <u>sympathy</u> detects another lock
            file it displays <b>Locked</b> in the status line and refuses I/O on the device  until  the  lock  file  is
            removed  or becomes invalid.  To lock the device use the -<b>K</b> option.  <u>Sympathy</u> will in addition check
            that the name of the device does not occur in <a href="file:/proc/cmdline">/proc/cmdline</a> as an argument  to  the  <u>console</u>  kernel
            parameter.  The -<b>d</b> option is incompatible with the -<b>p</b> option.

       <b>-p</b>   connect to a pseudo-tty instead of a terminal device, and fork a login shell in it. The -<b>p</b> option is
            incompatible with the -<b>d</b> option. This is the default terminal device if none is specified. The first
            non-option  command  line  arugment  is  considered  to  be  the  a binary to run in the pseudo-tty,
            subsequent arguments are parsed to the binary. The current value of PATH is searched for the  binary
            if  it  does not start with '/'. If no binary is specified then '<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>' is called with <u>argv[0]</u> set
            to '-'.

       <b>-K</b>   lock the terminal device specified in the -<b>d</b> option.  <u>Sympathy</u> generates lock files in a  staggering
            variety  of  formats  and  places. For locks based on the name of the device <u>sympathy</u> generates lock
            files for all devices with the same major and minor in <a href="file:/dev">/dev</a>, /dev/usb and  /dev/tts,  it  uses  both
            normal  and  lower  case  and  replaces occurrences of `/' in the device name with both `.' and `_'.
            <u>Sympathy</u> also generates locks based on the device major and minor numbers, and  for  all  lock  file
            names  generates  them  in  any  of  the  following  directories  that are writable: /var/lock/uucp,
            /var/spool/lock, /var/spool/uucp, /etc/locks,  /usr/spool/uucp,  /var/spool/locks,  /usr/spool/lock,
            /usr/spool/locks, /usr/spool/uucp/LCK, /var/lock.  Lock files are assumed to be in HDB format.

       <b>-b</b> <u>baud-rate</u>
            set  the  baud-rate  of the terminal device specified in the -<b>d</b> to <u>baud-rate</u>, if omitted the current
            baud-rate of the serial port will be used.

       <b>-f</b>   turn on flow control on the terminal device. This option adds <u>CRTSCTS</u> to <u>sympathy</u>'s default <u>c_cflag</u>s
            of <u>CS8|CREAD|CLOCAL</u>.

       <b>-L</b> <u>logfile</u>
            log activity to the file <u>logfile</u>. If <u>logfile</u> is `-' then log to <u>stdout</u>. Note that logging to  <u>stdout</u>
            only  makes  sense with the -<b>F</b> <u>server_option</u>.  <u>Sympathy</u> will also close and reopen its log file when
            it receives a <b>SIGHUP</b>, which with the <b>-P</b> allows the use of <a href="../man8/logrotate.8.html">logrotate</a>(8).

       <b>-P</b> <u>pidfile</u>
            write the pid of the server/terminal process to <u>pidfile</u>, which is removed on clean exit.

       <b>-R</b>   rotate log files. When the log-file specified with the <b>-L</b> option grows large <u>sympathy</u> will rotate it
            and compress old log-files.

       <b>-w</b> <u>width</u><b>[x</b><u>height</u><b>]</b>
            set the initial size of the terminal emulator's frame buffer to be <u>width</u> columns by <u>height</u> rows.  If
            <u>height</u>  is  omitted it defaults to 24, the default width is 80. These values may be overridden later
            by terminal escape sequences. If -<b>p</b> is also specified the pseudo-tty will have its window  size  set
            to match.

       <u>display_options</u><b>:</b>

       <b>-u</b>   attempt  to render Unicode characters in the internal frame buffer to the outer terminal emulator by
            using ISO-2202 sequences.  <u>Sympathy</u> currently only checks to see if an appropriate character appears
            in the VT102 US character set, or in the VT102 `special characters and line drawing' character  set.
            If the character appears in neither of these then it will be rendered on the outer terminal emulator
            as a `?'.

       <b>-H</b>   render the current state of the internal frame buffer to <u>stdout</u> as HTML, then quit.

       <b>-N</b>   don't  render  the  internal  frame  buffer using ANSI characters, but instead write characters that
            would be written to the screen to stdout. Take characters from stdin and send them  to  the  device.
            This feature is useful when you wish to use sympathy in conjunction with programs like <a href="../man1/expect.1.html">expect</a>(1).

       <b>-B</b>   Write the actual bytes read from the device to the logfile, rather than the rendered version.

       <u>client_options</u><b>:</b>

       <b>-k</b> <u>socket</u>
            set  the  name  in  the  file-system  of the socket to which <u>sympathy</u> should connect. This option is
            <b>mandatory</b> unless the -<b>s</b> or -<b>r</b> options have also been given. If -<b>s</b> is given then it will  default  to
            the  socket  which  the  forked server process opens. See the discussion of the -<b>r</b> option above, for
            information on how <u>sympathy</u> chooses a socket name if -<b>r</b> is specified.

       <b>-I</b> <b>string</b>
            Inject <u>string</u> to the device as if it had been typed at the keyboard.  Each character in  the  string
            is treated as a key-press.  <u>Sympathy</u> recognizes various common escapes for control characters. Other
            keys,  for example the arrow keys, are mapped to character codes between 128 and 255, see src/keys.h
            for details.

       <u>server_options</u><b>:</b>

       <b>-F</b>   tells the <u>sympathy</u> server process not to become a daemon but to  remain  the  the  foreground.  This
            option is incompatible with the -<b>c</b> -<b>s</b> major mode.

       <b>-k</b> <u>socket</u>
            set  the  name in the file-system of the socket on which <u>sympathy</u> should listen for clients. If this
            option is omitted <u>sympathy</u>  will  create  a  socket  in  <a href="file:~/.sympathy">~/.sympathy</a>,  creating  that  directory  if
            necessary,  and named <u>host-name</u>.<u>pid</u> where <u>pid</u> is the process id of the <u>sympathy</u> process that created
            the socket.

       <b>-n</b> <u>nlines</u>
            sets the number of lines of history that the server process stores to <u>nlines</u>. When a client connects
            <u>nlines</u> of history are injected into the outer terminal emulator  so  that  they  can  be  seen  when
            scrolling back. By default the server stores 200 lines of history.

       <b>-S</b>   tells the <u>sympathy</u> server process to log errors to syslog.

</pre><h4><b>OPERATION</b></h4><pre>
       When <u>sympathy</u> is relaying data to the outer terminal emulator a reverse video status line will be visible
       at  the  bottom  of  the  screen. The status line shows pertinent information. The first item on the line
       reminds you what the current escape character is, the second  indicates  the  terminal  device  to  which
       <u>sympathy</u> is connected, and the third shows the current baud-rate. Other messages are:

       <b>Flow</b> indicates that that RTS/CTS flow control is in operation on the terminal device.

       <b>RTS</b>  indicates  that  the terminal device is asserting the RTS line which indicates that the local system
            is ready to accept data from the remote system. If RTS/CTS flow control is  in  operation  then  the
            operating  system or hardware may de-assert RTS even if RTS is shown. See the section on SERIAL PORT
            THEORY for more information.

       <b>CTS</b>  indicates that the terminal device has detected that the local system's CTS line is being  asserted,
            indicating that the remote system is ready to receive data from the local system. See the section on
            SERIAL PORT THEORY for more information.

       <b>DTR</b>  indicates  that the terminal device is asserting the DTR line indicating that the local system would
            like the local DCE to establish a connection to the remote DCE.  See  the  section  on  SERIAL  PORT
            THEORY for more information.

       <b>DSR</b>  indicates  that the terminal device has detected that the local system's DSR line is being asserted,
            indicating that the local DCE is ready. See the section on SERIAL PORT THEORY for more information.

       <b>CD</b>   indicates that the terminal device has detected that the local system's CD line is  being  asserted,
            indicating  that  the  local DCE has a connection to the remote DCE.  See the section on SERIAL PORT
            THEORY for more information.

       <b>RI</b>   indicates that the terminal device has detected that the local system's RI line is  being  asserted,
            indicating that the DCE has detected a ringing signal or incoming connexion.

       <b>n</b> <b>clients</b>
            shows the number of connected client processes. In the -<b>t</b> major mode, this will always be zero.

       <b>Locked</b>
            the terminal device was opened without the -K flag and another process is currently using it. I/O to
            the device is currently suspended until the process dies or removes its lock file.

       <b>n</b> <b>errs</b>
            indicates  the  number  of  frames received by the terminal device with errors (indicating the wrong
            parity, baud-rate or framing). The count resets if no errors are  detected  by  the  device  for  10
            seconds.

       <b>try</b> <b>higher</b>
            <u>Sympathy</u>  thinks that you have set the wrong baud-rate and is unable to determine the correct one as
            the current baud-rate is lower than the correct baud-rate. Use the <b>baud</b>  command  to  set  a  higher
            baud-rate (eg 115200) and <u>sympathy</u> will try again.

       <b>try</b> <u>rate</u><b>b</b>
            <u>Sympathy</u> thinks that you have set the wrong baud-rate and thinks that the correct baud-rate is <u>rate</u>.
            Use the <b>baud</b> command to change the current baud-rate.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       Commands  are  entered  by  sending  the escape character, <a href="../man7/ascii.7.html">ascii</a>(7) STX, from the outer terminal emulator
       (usually by pressing CTRL-B), typing the command and pressing return. Whilst the command is  entered  the
       status  line changes to `:' and rudimentary line editing is available.  Whilst the command is entered the
       cursor <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>move</b> but remains where the terminal emulator has placed it. Pressing the escape character
       whilst in command mode will send the escape character to the terminal  and  cancel  command  mode.  Valid
       commands are:

       <b>ansi</b>   switch  from  VT102  behaviour  to ANSI behaviour. The most noticeable difference is the so-called
              `xn' glitch.

       <b>noansi</b> switch from ANSI behaviour to VT102 behaviour.

       <b>baud</b> <u>nnnn</u>
              set the current baud-rate to nnnn

       <b>break</b>  send the break signal by asserting the TX line for longer than a frame period.

       <b>flow</b>   enable RTS/CTS flow control

       <b>noflow</b> disable RTS/CTS flow control

       <b>hangup</b> de-assert DTR for one second.

       <b>width</b> <u>nn</u>
              set the current width of the screen to <u>nn</u>, and reset the terminal emulator.

       <b>height</b> <u>nn</u>
              set the current height of the screen to <u>nn</u>, and reset the terminal emulator.

       <b>reset</b>  reset the terminal emulator

       <b>expand</b> expand the size of the screen to fit the size of the current outer terminal emulator window

       <b>quit</b>   exit this instance of <u>sympathy</u> (disconnect from the server if present)

</pre><h4><b>CHARACTER</b> <b>ENCODINGS</b></h4><pre>
       For characters between 32 and 126 <u>sympathy</u> interprets them as would a VT102  terminal  by  following  the
       subset  of  ISO-2202  that  the VT102 supports. Characters 128 thru 255 are assumed to be in <a href="../man7/UTF-8.7.html">UTF-8</a>(7), if
       however the UTF-8 is invalid they will instead be interpreted as characters from <a href="../man7/ISO_8859-1.7.html">ISO_8859-1</a>(7). Character
       155 (0x9b) when not part of a valid UTF-8 sequence will be interpreted as the one byte CSI character.

       For the outer terminal emulator <u>sympathy</u> by default issues the ESC % G sequence to select UTF-8 mode  and
       emits  valid  UTF-8.  If  the  outer terminal does not, however, support UTF-8 use the -<b>u</b> switch to force
       <u>sympathy</u> to use the VT102 subset of ISO-2202.

</pre><h4><b>LOG</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Log files are made exclusively in the UTF-8 encoding. Each line in the log file starts with the date  and
       time at which the entry was made - for example:

              Feb 27 23:24:42.509440

       <u>Sympathy</u> logs a line to the file whenever the cursor leaves the line. Additionally <u>sympathy</u>

       •  logs certain other events to the file:

       •  serial port parameter changes: baud-rate and flow control.

       •  serial port control line state changes.

       •  serial port line discipline errors.

       •  serial port errors.

       •  suggested baud rates and bit frequency analyses.

       •  transmission of breaks.

       •  sending of the hangup signal (dropping the DTR line).

       •  unknown or un-handled messages sent on the socket.

       •  connexion and disconnexion of clients.

       •  reception of SIGHUP.

       •  invalid UTF-8 sequences.

       •  terminal size changes

       •  un-handled terminal command sequences

       The  log  file  is  rotated when it gets too large if the <u>-R</u> option is specified, and the log file is re-
       opened on receipt of a <b>SIGHUP</b> which together with the  <b>-P</b>  allows  the  use  of  of  a  program  such  as
       <a href="../man8/logrotate.8.html">logrotate</a>(8)

</pre><h4><b>AUTOMATIC</b> <b>BAUD</b> <b>RATE</b> <b>ALGORITHM</b></h4><pre>
       If  <u>sympathy</u>  detects  a  framing  error on the serial port it displays the count of errors on the status
       line, and logs the error.

              &lt;tty reports error: \377 \000 \000&gt;

       The count is reset to zero after ten seconds have elapsed during which no errors have occurred.  <u>Sympathy</u>
       looks at bit patterns of the characters received, and measures the length  (in  units  of  the  receiving
       UART's  bit  period)  of  any  runs  of  '1's  delimited  by  '0's and vice-versa. It then calculates the
       statistics on the length of these runs, and logs these.

              &lt;tty_bit_analyse: 0000000001  [0,0,0,0,0,0,110,0,0,80]&gt;

       For a typical stream of ASCII data, the most common run length will be the correct bit period.   <u>Sympathy</u>
       uses this together with the current bit period to calculate the most probable correct baud-rate, which is
       displayed  in the status line, and logged.  If the correct baudirate is higher than the current baud-rate
       then the most common bit frequency will be '0' or '1' and the correct baud-rate cannot be determined.  In
       this case sympathy will display and log the message 'try higher'.

              &lt;tty_analyse:     80 errors, current rate 115200b, suggest 19200b&gt;

       The  algorithm  only  works  well  if  the  data stream is normal. If the data stream is generated by the
       reception, at the wrong baud-rate, of characters emitted by <u>sympathy</u> then the algorithm  will  be  biased
       towards  suggesting  that  the  baud-rate  is  too  low.  Noise  on the line will also result in sympathy
       concluding that the baud-rate is too low.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Sympathy</u> reacts to a set of signals. You can use the <b>-P</b>  option  to  easily  determine  the  PID  of  the
       <u>sympathy</u> process to which you would like to send a signal.

       <b>SIGINT</b>  <u>Sympathy</u>  will  immediately  try to restore the outer terminal emulator to its original state and
               then exit.

       <b>SIGHUP</b>  <u>Sympathy</u> will close and reopen the log-file specified with the -L option, which allows the use of
               programs like <a href="../man8/logrotate.8.html">logrotate</a>(8)

       <b>SIGWINCH</b>
               <u>Sympathy</u> will redraw the display in the outer terminal emulator so that it will  fit  within  the
               new display size.

       <b>SIGCHLD</b> <u>Sympathy</u> will wait for children if some were born (for example from compressing rotated logs)

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <u>sympathy</u> uses the <b>HOME</b> environment variable to determine the default location for sockets.
       <u>sympathy</u> sets the value of <b>TERM</b> in pseudo-ttys spawned using the -<b>p</b> argument to `xterm'.
       <u>Sympathy</u>  will  use  <b>CSI</b> <b>]</b> <b>0</b> <b>;</b> to set the window title to the name of the socket or device if <b>TERM</b> starts
       with <u>xterm</u> or <u>rxvt</u>.
       The <b>PATH</b> enviroment variable is searched for the binary to be run in the pseudo-tty.

</pre><h4><b>EMULATION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Sympathy</u> completely emulates a VT102 terminal (including the VT52 emulation).  <u>Sympathy</u> also  emulates  a
       few  extra  sequences:  the  <a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a>(1)  ESC  ]  ... sequences, and the ANSI CSI @ and CSI b sequences. The
       numeric keypad follows exactly the sequences produced by an  xterm  rather  than  the  exact  VT102/VT220
       sequences.  <u>Sympathy</u> also recognises the ESC % G and the ESC % @ sequences to switch between ISO-2202 and
       UTF-8 but ignores them (see CHARACTER ENCODING below)

</pre><h4><b>SERIAL</b> <b>PORT</b> <b>THEORY</b></h4><pre>
       A  serial  connexion  was  originally envisaged to connect a DTE (Data Terminal Equipment) to a DCE (Data
       Circuit-terminating Equipment). The DCE (some sort of modem) would assert  the  DTE's  (the  computer  or
       terminal)  DSR  line  to  indicate  it was ready. The DTE would assert DTR to indicate to the DCE that it
       should attempt a connexion to the remote DCE.  Once a connexion was established the DCE would assert  the
       DTE's  CD pin. Data could then flow between the DTR and the remote DTE via the two DCEs. Flow control was
       provided via the RTS and CTS lines. The DTE asserts RTS when it is capable of  receiving  new  data,  and
       pauses  its  transmission  of  data  when the CTS line is de-asserted. The local DCE asserts CTS when the
       remote DCE detects RTS, and vice versa.

       In modern usage the signals are slightly different, for a typical connexion using  modems  DSR  indicates
       that  the  modem is ready, a drop DTR is used to indicate to the modem that it should break the connexion
       to the remote modem.  CD indicates that the local modem is connected to the remote modem, and CTS and RTS
       behave as before. Connexion is established by in-band signalling before CD is asserted.

       For a <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> cable local DSR and DTR are wired to remote CD, local CTS to remote RTS, and  local  RTS
       to  remote CTS. Thus asserting local DTR asserts local DSR and remote CD, and asserting local RTS asserts
       remote CTS.

       When RTS/CTS flow control is in operation and the receive buffer becomes full, the operating  system,  or
       the hardware, de-asserts RTS, causing (via the DCEs or the null modem cable) a de-assertion of remote CTS
       which in turn causes the remote DTE to cease transmission.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       using <u>sympathy</u> to mimic <a href="../man1/screen.1.html">screen</a>(1):

              [foo@barhost ~]$ sympathy

              <u>Sympathy</u>  forks.  The  child becomes a daemon server and launches a new shell in a pseudo-tty, the
              original process becomes a client and connects to the server and shows the output. The  user  then
              uses  the  new  shell and after some time either hangs up on the client or issues CTRL-B quit, and
              the client detaches from the server.

              Later the user wishes to retrieve her session and to determine which sympathy sessions are  active
              and issues:

              [foo@barhost ~]$ sympathy -ls
                      /home/foo/.sympathy/barhost.8843       (Active)
              [foo@barhost ~]$

              The user then issues:

              [foo@barhost ~]$ sympathy -r 8843

              and is reconnected to her session.

       using sympathy to mimic <a href="../man1/minicom.1.html">minicom</a>(1):

              [foo@barhost ~]$ sympathy -t -d /dev/modem -b 9600 -K

              <u>Sympathy</u>  opens  the  device /dev/modem and locks it, sets the baud-rate to 9600 baud and disables
              flow control. A VT102 terminal emulator then displays the data from the modem. The user quits  the
              emulator by issuing CTRL-B quit, which unlocks the modem and exits <u>sympathy.</u>

       using <u>sympathy</u> to mimic <a href="../man1/consolidate.1.html">consolidate</a>(1):

              [foo@barhost   ~]$   sympathy   -s   -d   /dev/ttyS13   -b   19200   -K   -k  /var/sympathy/13  -L
              /var/sympathy/13.log -R

              <u>Sympathy</u> becomes a daemon and detaches from the current tty. It then opens the device  /dev/ttyS13
              and  locks  it, sets the baud-rate to 19200 baud and disables flow control.  <u>Sympathy</u> then listens
              for clients connecting on the socket <u>/var/sympathy/13</u>, whilst logging completed lines and  changes
              in status to the file <u>/var/sympathy/13.log</u>, rotating the log file when it gets too large.

              A user wishing to see the current status of /dev/ttyS13 issues:

              [foo@barhost ~]$ sympathy -c -k /var/sympathy/13
              or
              [foo@barhost ~]$ sympathy -r 13

              and the last 200 lines of history are injected into the history of her outer terminal emulator and
              she is connected to /dev/ttyS13. The user disconnects from the server by issuing CTRL-B quit.

       using <u>sympathy</u> to mimic <a href="../man1/script.1.html">script</a>(1):

              [foo@barhost ~]$ sympathy -t -L typescript

              <u>Sympathy</u>  starts a shell in a ptty and logs completed lines to the file typescript. When the shell
              exits <u>sympathy</u> will terminate, or the user can press CTRL-B which will close the ptty and  send  a
              hangup to its controlling process.
