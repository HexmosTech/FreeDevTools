       <b>makeppclean</b> [ -b ] [ -l ] [ -R ] [ -r ] [ -v ] [ <u>path</u> ... ]

       Makeppclean efficiently removes files that were knowingly generated through makepp.  For each <u>path</u>, if
       <u>path</u> is not a directory and was known to be generated by makepp by virtue of having a build info file
       with a matching signature, then remove <u>path</u> and its build info file; and if <u>path</u> is a directory, do the
       same for every file in <u>path</u>, and then remove the build info directory below <u>path</u>.  <u>path</u> defaults to ".".

       The traditional approach to removing generated files is to create a "clean" target in your makefiles
       whose action is to remove all of the targets.  This approach has some fundamental limitations:

       • It requires that all the relevant makefiles be loaded before cleaning. This can take quite a while.

       • If  the  clean  target  in  one  makefile  depends  on the clean target in another makefile, then it is
         possible that a file that must be built in order to load one  of  the  makefiles  (e.g.  because  of  a
         prebuild  statement) has already been built and cleaned by the time it needs to be built again.  Makepp
         wisely fails in this situation, rather than potentially building the same file many  times  during  the
         course of a single build.

       Provided  that  your intention is to remove all the generated files without regard for which makefile (if
       any) currently generates them, then these limitations are avoided by using makeppclean.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -A <u>filename</u>
       --args-file=<u>filename</u>
       --arguments-file=<u>filename</u>
           Read the file and parse it as possibly quoted whitespace- and/or newline-separated options.

       -b
       --build-cache-links
       --only-build-cache-links
           Remove only links or files from a build cache.

       -d
       --empty-directories
           Remove directories that became empty after removing their content.  Since directories are not usually
           created by rules, makepp does not keep track of which one it  created.   Therefore  this  applies  to
           those, where makepp created something, whether the directory was created manually or automatically.

       -?
       -h
       --help
           Print out a brief summary of the options.

       -k
       --keep-src-info
       --leave-src-info
           Leave the build info directory below each named directory.

       -l
       --log
       --only-logs
           Remove only the raw logfiles, which can be many in case of traditional recursion.

       -m
       --meta
       --only-meta
       --makepp
           Remove only the meta information subdirectories.

       -R
       --repository-links
       --only-repository-links
           Remove only links pointing to a repository.

       -r
       --recurse
       --recursive
           Descend each named directory recursively.  Symbolic links are not followed.

       -v
       --verbose
           Enable verbose output to STDERR.

       -V
       --version
           Print out the version number.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Makeppclean looks at the following environment variable:

       $MAKEPPCLEANFLAGS
           Any  flags  in  this environment variable are interpreted as command line options before any explicit
           options.  Quotes are interpreted like in makefiles.
