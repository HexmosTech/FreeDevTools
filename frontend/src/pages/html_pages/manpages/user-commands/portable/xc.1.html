       xc - portable IRAF compile/link utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xc</b> [<u>flags</u>] <u>files</u>...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>XC</b>  is  a  machine independent utility for compiling and linking IRAF tasks or files.  The XC utility may
       also be used to compile and/or link non-IRAF files and tasks. It can be used to generate fortran from xpp
       or ratfor code, to compile any number of files, and then link them if desired.  XC accepts and maps  IRAF
       virtual  filenames,  but  since it is a standalone bootstrap utility the environment is not passed, hence
       logical directories cannot be used.

       It is suggested that everyone stick with the iraf virtual file name extensions.  These are : .x, .r,  .f,
       .c, .s, .o, .a, .e. The meaning of these is:

            .x   SPP code
            .r   Ratfor code
            .f   Fortran code
            .c   C code
            .s   Macro assembler code
            .o   Object module
            .a   Library file
            .e   Executable Image

       XC is available both in the CL and as a standalone task.  Usage is equivalent in either case.

</pre><h4><b>FLAGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c</b>     Tells <b>xc</b> not to link, i.e., not to create an executable.

       <b>-d</b>     Causes debug messages to be printed during execution.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>-f</b> Do not delete the Fortran translation of an SPP source file.

       <b>-h</b>     Causes  the  executable  to  be  linked as a host program, i.e., without the IRAF main and without
              searching the IRAF libraries, unless explicitly referenced on the command line.  Used  to  compile
              and link host (e.g., Fortran) programs which may or may not reference the IRAF libraries.

       <b>-H</b>     Link a host program as with "-h", but include the VOS libraries.

       <b>-A</b>     Force architecture specific include files.

       <b>-C</b>     Link  a  host program which has a C main.  We may need to tweak the command line as a special case
              here since we normally assume Fortran sources.

       <b>-/</b><u>flag</u>, <b>-//</b><u>foo</u>
              Pass <u>flag</u> to host compiler without  further  interpretation.  "-/<u>flag</u>"  becomes  "-<u>foo</u>",  "-//<u>foo</u>"
              becomes "<u>foo</u>".

       <b>-D</b><u>define</u>
              Pass a -D<u>define</u> flag on to the host compiler.

       <b>-I</b><u>dir</u>  Pass  a -I<u>dir</u> flag on to the host compiler.  A special case is "-Inolibc" which disables automatic
              inclusion of the IRAF LIBC includes (hlib$libc).

       <b>-l</b><u>lib</u>, <b>-L</b><u>dir</u>
              This tells the linker which library files or library directories  besides  the  standard  ones  to
              include.   These  must  be  either on the current directory, or in an IRAF system library (lib$ or
              hlib$).  The library specification must be immediately after the  option  as  in  "-lxtools".   No
              other option may follow the 'l' option in the same argument as in -lxtoolsO.

       <b>-N</b>     Generates  the  output temp file in <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> during the link, then moves it to the output directory in
              one operation when done.  For cases such as linking in an NFS-mounted directory, where all the NFS
              i/o may slow the link down excessively.

       <b>-Nh</b> [<u>filename</u>]
              This tells xpp that the foreign definitions in the file specified should be used in preference  to
              standard include files.

       <b>-o</b>     This  flag  redirects the output of the compile if used in conjunction with -c option or specifies
              where the executable or object is to be placed.  If not given the  first  file  name  is  used  to
              obtain the name for the executable or object.

       <b>-O</b>     Optimize  object  code  produced;  this  is now the default, but this switch is still provided for
              backwards compatibility.

       <b>-p</b> <u>pkgname</u>
              Load the package environment for the named external package, e.g., "xc -c -p noao file.x".  If the
              same package is always specified the environment variable or logical name PKGENV may be defined at
              the host level to accomplish the same thing.  The  package  name  <u>must</u>  be  specified  when  doing
              software development in an external or layered package.

       <b>-q</b>     Disable optimization.  Opposite of -O.  Object code will be optimized by default.

       <b>-w</b>     Suppress warnings. Forwarded to the compiler and linker.

       <b>-x</b>     Compile and link for debugging.

       <b>-z</b>, <b>-e</b>, <b>-t</b>, <b>-T</b>, <b>-s</b>
              Ignored. Provided for backward compatibility.

       <b>-V</b>     Print XC version identification.
