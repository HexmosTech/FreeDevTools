</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xpdf - Portable Document Format (PDF) file viewer for X (xpopple)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xpdf</b> [options] [<u>PDF-file</u> [<u>page</u> | +<u>dest</u>]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xpopple</b>  is  a  viewer  for  Portable Document Format (PDF) files.  (These are also sometimes also called
       'Acrobat' files, from the name of Adobe's PDF software.)  xpopple runs under the X Window System on UNIX.

       xpopple uses the Poppler library to process PDF files.  Poppler was originally derived from version 3  of
       Glyph  &amp;  Cog,  LLC's Xpdf suite, but Poppler doesn't include the Xpdf viewer program itself.  xpopple is
       the Xpdf program, modified to use Poppler.

       To run xpopple, simply type:

              xpdf file.pdf

       where <u>file.pdf</u> is your PDF file.  The file name can be followed by a number  specifying  the  page  which
       should be displayed first, e.g.:

              xpdf file.pdf 18

       You  can  also  give  a  named destination, prefixed with '+' in place of the page number.  (This is only
       useful with PDF files that provide named destination targets.)

       You can also start xpdf without opening any files:

              xpdf

       Various compressed formats (gz, bz2, xz, and Z) are also supported, for example::

              xpdf file.pdf.gz

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       Xpdf reads a configuration file at startup.  It first tries to  find  the  user's  private  config  file,
       <a href="file:~/.xpdfrc.">~/.xpdfrc.</a>   If  that  doesn't  exist, it looks for a system-wide config file, /etc/xpdf/xpdfrc.  See the
       <b><a href="../man5/xpdfrc.5.html">xpdfrc</a></b>(5) man page for details.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Many of the following options can be set with configuration file commands  or  X  resources.   These  are
       listed in square brackets with the description of the corresponding command line option.

       <b>-g</b> <u>geometry</u>
              Set the initial window geometry.  (<b>-geometry</b> is equivalent.)  [X resource: <b>Xpdf.geometry</b>]

       <b>-title</b> <u>title</u>
              Set the window title.  By default, the title will be "xpdf: foo.pdf".  [X resource: <b>Xpdf.title</b>]

       <b>-cmap</b>  Install a private colormap.  This is ignored on TrueColor visuals.  [X resource: <b>Xpdf.installCmap</b>]

       <b>-rgb</b> <u>number</u>
              Set  the size of largest RGB cube xpdf will try to allocate.  The default is 5 (for a 5x5x5 cube);
              set to a smaller number to conserve color table entries.  This is ignored with  private  colormaps
              and on TrueColor visuals.  [X resource: <b>Xpdf.rgbCubeSize</b>]

       <b>-rv</b>    Set  reverse video mode.  This reverses the colors of everything except images.  It may not always
              produce great results for PDF files which do weird things with color.  This also causes the  paper
              color to default to black.  [X resource: <b>Xpdf.reverseVideo</b>]

       <b>-papercolor</b> <u>color</u>
              Set the "paper color", i.e., the background of the page display.  This will not work too well with
              PDF files that do things like filling in white behind the text.  [X resource: <b>Xpdf.paperColor</b>]

       <b>-mattecolor</b> <u>color</u>
              Set  the matte color, i.e., the color used for background outside the actual page area.  (There is
              a  separate   setting,   Xpdf.fullScreenMatteColor,   for   full-screen   mode.)    [X   resource:
              <b>Xpdf.matteColor</b>]

       <b>-z</b> <u>zoom</u>
              Set  the  initial zoom factor.  A number specifies a zoom percentage, where 100 means 72 dpi.  You
              may also specify 'page', to fit the page to the window size, or 'width', to fit the page width  to
              the  window  width,  or  'height',  to  fit  the  page  height  to the window height [config file:
              <b>initialZoom</b>; or X resource: <b>Xpdf.initialZoom</b>]

       <b>-cont</b>  Start in continuous view mode, i.e., with one vertical scroll bar for the whole document.  [config
              file: <b>continuousView</b>]

       <b>-ps</b> <u>PS-file</u>
              Set the default file name for PostScript output (i.e., the name which will  appear  in  the  print
              dialog).   This  can  also  be  of  the form '| command' to pipe the PostScript through a command.
              [config file: <b>psFile</b>]

       <b>-paper</b> <u>size</u>
              Set the paper size to one of "letter", "legal", "A4", or "A3".  This can also be set  to  "match",
              which  will  set  the  paper  size  to  match  the  size specified in the PDF file.  [config file:
              <b>psPaperSize</b>]

       <b>-paperw</b> <u>size</u>
              Set the paper width, in points.  [config file: <b>psPaperSize</b>]

       <b>-paperh</b> <u>size</u>
              Set the paper height, in points.  [config file: <b>psPaperSize</b>]

       <b>-level1</b>
              Generate Level 1 PostScript.  The resulting PostScript files will be significantly larger (if they
              contain images), but will print on Level 1 printers.  This also converts all images to  black  and
              white.  [config file: <b>psLevel</b>]

       <b>-enc</b> <u>encoding-name</u>
              Sets  the  encoding to use for text output.  The <u>encoding-name</u> must be defined with the unicodeMap
              command (see <b><a href="../man5/xpdfrc.5.html">xpdfrc</a></b>(5)).  This defaults to "Latin1" (which is a built-in encoding).  [config file:
              <b>textEncoding</b>]

       <b>-opw</b> <u>password</u>
              Specify  the  owner  password  for  the  PDF  file.   Providing  this  will  bypass  all  security
              restrictions.

       <b>-upw</b> <u>password</u>
              Specify the user password for the PDF file.

       <b>-fullscreen</b>
              Open xpdf in full-screen mode, useful for presentations.

       <b>-pagecmd</b> <u>command</u>
              Run  a shell command each time a new page is displayed, with the page number as an argument.  This
              can be used for presentation recording.  [config file: <b>pageCommand</b>]

       <b>-remote</b> <u>name</u>
              Start/contact xpdf remote server with specified name (see the <b>REMOTE</b> <b>SERVER</b> <b>MODE</b> section below).

       <b>-exec</b> <u>command</u>
              Execute a command (see the <b>COMMANDS</b> section below) in an xpdf remote server window  (with  -remote
              only).

       <b>-reload</b>
              Reload xpdf remote server window (with -remote only).

       <b>-raise</b> Raise xpdf remote server window (with -remote only).

       <b>-quit</b>  Kill xpdf remote server (with -remote only).

       <b>-cmd</b>   Print commands as they're executed (useful for debugging).  [config file: <b>printCommands</b>]

       <b>-q</b>     Don't print any messages or errors.  [config file: <b>errQuiet</b>]

       <b>-cfg</b> <u>config-file</u>
              Read <u>config-file</u> in place of <a href="file:~/.xpdfrc">~/.xpdfrc</a> or the system-wide config file.

       <b>-v</b>     Print copyright and version information.

       <b>-h</b>     Print usage information.  (<b>-help</b>, <b>--help</b> and <b>-?</b>  are equivalent.)

       <b>-m</b> <u>file1</u> <u>file2</u> <u>...</u>
              Open  multiple  pdf  files:  <u>file1</u>  <u>file2</u> <u>...</u>  etc.  NOTE: The list of files is terminated once an
              argument starting with a dash is encountered.  In order to view file names starting with  a  dash,
              simply prepend "./".  <b>-m</b> may be used multiple times.

       Several other standard X options and resources will work as expected:

       <b>-display</b> <u>display</u>
              [X resource: <b>Xpdf.display</b>]

       <b>-fg</b> <u>color</u>
              (<b>-foreground</b> is equivalent.)  [X resource: <b>xpdf*Foreground</b>]

       <b>-bg</b> <u>color</u>
              (<b>-background</b> is equivalent.)  [X resource: <b>xpdf*Background</b>]

       <b>-font</b> <u>font</u>
              Override  the  fonts  used  for  the  user interface.  This uses a single X core font for all user
              interface elements, which is not ideal; see the <b>USER</b> <b>INTERFACE</b>  <b>FONTS</b>  section  below  for  better
              approaches.  (<b>-fn</b> is equivalent.)  [X resource: <b>xpdf*font</b>]

       The color and font options only affect the user interface elements, not the PDF display (the 'paper').

       The following X resources do not have command line option equivalents:

       <b>Xpdf.toolTipEnable</b>
              Enables (if set to true) or disables (if set to false) the tool-tips on the toolbar buttons.

       <b>Xpdf.fullScreenMatteColor</b>
              Sets the matte color to be used in full-screen mode.  The default setting is "black".

</pre><h4><b>OBSOLETE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  command line options were accepted by earlier versions of Xpdf but are no longer allowed.
       In most cases, this is because they control rendering options that Poppler does not support.

       <b>-aa</b> <u>yes</u> <u>|</u> <u>no</u>
              Obsolete.  Controlled the use of font anti-aliasing in the PDF rasterizer.

       <b>-aaVector</b> <u>yes</u> <u>|</u> <u>no</u>
              Obsolete.  Controlled the use of vector anti-aliasing in the PDF rasterizer.

       <b>-eol</b> <u>unix</u> <u>|</u> <u>dos</u> <u>|</u> <u>mac</u>
              Obsolete.  Set the end-of-line convention to use for text output.

       <b>-freetype</b> <u>yes</u> <u>|</u> <u>no</u>
              Obsolete.  Controlled whether FreeType was used for font rasterization.

       <b>-t1lib</b> <u>yes</u> <u>|</u> <u>no</u>
              Obsolete.  Controlled whether t1lib was used for font rasterization.

</pre><h4><b>CONTROLS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>On-screen</b> <b>controls,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>xpdf</b> <b>window</b>
       <b>left/right</b> <b>arrow</b> <b>buttons</b>
              Move to the previous/next page.

       <b>double</b> <b>left/right</b> <b>arrow</b> <b>buttons</b>
              Move backward or forward by ten pages.

       <b>dashed</b> <b>left/right</b> <b>arrow</b> <b>buttons</b>
              Move backward or forward along the history path.

       <b>'Page'</b> <b>entry</b> <b>box</b>
              Move to a specific page number.  Click in the box to activate it, type the page number,  then  hit
              return.

       <b>zoom</b> <b>popup</b> <b>menu</b>
              Change the zoom factor (see the description of the -z option above).

       <b>binoculars</b> <b>button</b>
              Find a text string.

       <b>print</b> <b>button</b>
              Bring up a dialog for generating a PostScript file.  The dialog has options to set the pages to be
              printed  and the PostScript file name.  The file name can be '-' for stdout or '| command' to pipe
              the PostScript through a command, e.g., '| lpr'.

       <b>'?'</b> <b>button</b>
              Bring up the 'about xpdf' window.

       <b>link</b> <b>info</b>
              The space between the '?' and 'Quit' buttons is used to show the URL or external  file  name  when
              the mouse is over a link.

       <b>'Quit'</b> <b>button</b>
              Quit xpdf.

   <b>Menu</b>
       Pressing the right mouse button will post a popup menu with the following commands:

       <b>Open...</b>
              Open a new PDF file via a file requester.

       <b>Open</b> <b>in</b> <b>new</b> <b>window...</b>
              Create a new window and open a new PDF file via a file requester.

       <b>Reload</b> Reload  the current PDF file.  Note that Xpdf will reload the file automatically (on a page change
              or redraw) if it has changed since it was last loaded.

       <b>Save</b> <b>as...</b>
              Save the current file via a file requester.

       <b>Continuous</b> <b>view</b>
              Toggles between single page and continuous view modes.

       <b>Rotate</b> <b>counterclockwise</b>
              Rotate the page 90 degrees counterclockwise.

       <b>Rotate</b> <b>clockwise</b>
              Rotate the page 90 degrees clockwise.  The two rotate commands  are  intended  primarily  for  PDF
              files where the rotation isn't correctly specified in the file.

       <b>Zoom</b> <b>to</b> <b>selection</b>
              Zoom in to the currently selected rectangle.

       <b>Close</b>  Close the current window.  If this is the only open window, the document is closed, but the window
              is left open (i.e., this menu command won't quit xpdf).

       <b>Quit</b>   Quit xpdf.

   <b>Outline</b>
       If the PDF contains an outline (a.k.a., bookmarks), there will be an outline pane on the left side of the
       window.   The  width  of  the  outline pane is adjustable with a vertical split bar via the knob near its
       bottom end.

   <b>Text</b> <b>selection</b>
       Dragging the mouse with the left button held down will highlight an arbitrary rectangle.  Any text inside
       this rectangle will be copied to the X selection buffer.

   <b>Links</b>
       Clicking on a hyperlink will jump to the link's destination.  A link to another PDF  document  will  make
       xpdf  load  that  document.   A  'launch' link to an executable program will display a dialog, and if you
       click 'ok', execute the program.  URL links call an  external  command  (see  the  <b>WEB</b>  <b>BROWSERS</b>  section
       below).

   <b>Panning</b>
       Dragging the mouse with the middle button held down pans the window.

   <b>Key</b> <b>bindings</b>
       <b>o</b>      Open a new PDF file via a file requester.

       <b>r</b>      Reload  the current PDF file.  Note that Xpdf will reload the file automatically (on a page change
              or redraw) if it has changed since it was last loaded.

       <b>s</b>      Save the current PDF file via a file requester.

       <b>control-L</b>
              Redraw the current page.

       <b>control-W</b>
              Close the current window.

       <b>f</b> or <b>control-F</b> or <b>/</b>
              Find a text string.

       <b>control-G</b>
              Find next occurrence.

       <b>control-shift-G</b>
              Find previous occurrence.

       <b>control-P</b>
              Print.

       <b>n</b>      Move to the next page.  Scrolls to the top of the page, unless scroll lock is turned on.

       <b>p</b>      Move to the previous page.  Scrolls to the top of the page, unless scroll lock is turned on.

       <b>&lt;Space&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;PageDown&gt;</b>
              Scroll down on the current page; if already at bottom, move to next page.

       <b>&lt;Backspace&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;Delete&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;PageUp&gt;</b>
              Scroll up on the current page; if already at top, move to previous page.

       <b>v</b>      Move forward along the history path.

       <b>b</b>      Move backward along the history path.

       <b>&lt;Home&gt;</b> Scroll to top of current page.

       <b>&lt;End&gt;</b>  Scroll to bottom of current page.

       <b>control-&lt;Home&gt;</b>

       <b>-</b>      Zoom out (decrement the zoom factor by 1).

       <b>z</b>      Set the zoom factor to 'page' (fit page to window).

       <b>w</b>      Set the zoom factor to 'width' (fit page width to window).

       <b>h</b>      Set the zoom factor to 'height' (fit page height to window).

       <b>alt-F</b>  Toggle full-screen mode.

       <b>?</b>      Open the 'about' dialog.

       <b>q</b> or <b>&lt;Escape&gt;</b>
              Quit xpdf.

</pre><h4><b>WEB</b> <b>BROWSERS</b></h4><pre>
       If you want to run xpdf automatically from netscape or mosaic (and  probably  other  browsers)  when  you
       click  on  a  link to a PDF file, you need to edit (or create) the files <u>.mime.types</u> and <u>.mailcap</u> in your
       home directory.  In <u>.mime.types</u> add the line:

              application/pdf pdf

       In <u>.mailcap</u> add the lines:

              # Use xpdf to view PDF files.
              application/pdf; xpdf -q %s

       Make sure that xpdf is on your executable search path.

       When you click on a URL link in a PDF file, xpdf will execute the command  specified  by  the  urlCommand
       config file option, replacing an occurrence of '%s' with the URL.  For example, to call netscape with the
       URL, add this line to your config file:

              urlCommand "netscape -remote 'openURL(%s)'"

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       Xpdf's key and mouse bindings are user-configurable, using the bind and unbind options in the config file
       (see  <b><a href="../man5/xpdfrc.5.html">xpdfrc</a></b>(5)).  The bind command allows you to bind a key or mouse button to a sequence of one or more
       commands.

   <b>Available</b> <b>Commands</b>
       The following commands are supported:

       <b>gotoPage(</b><u>page</u><b>)</b>

                  %% =&gt; %

              The external command string will often contain spaces, so the whole command must be quoted in  the

              mouse button binding.)

       <b>followLinkInNewWinNoSel</b>
              Same  as  followLinkInNewWin, but does nothing if there is a non-empty selection.  (This is useful

       Previous versions of xpdf included a "viKeys" X resource.  It is no longer available, but  the  following
       bindings are equivalent:

           bind h any <a href="../man16/scrollLeft.16.html">scrollLeft</a>(16)
           bind l any <a href="../man16/scrollRight.16.html">scrollRight</a>(16)
           bind k any <a href="../man16/scrollUp.16.html">scrollUp</a>(16)
           bind j any <a href="../man16/scrollDown.16.html">scrollDown</a>(16)

</pre><h4><b>REMOTE</b> <b>SERVER</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       Xpdf  can  be started in remote server mode by specifying a server name (in addition to the file name and
       page number).  For example:

              xpdf -remote myServer file.pdf

       If there is currently no xpdf running in server mode with the name 'myServer', a new xpdf window will  be
       opened.  If another command:

              xpdf -remote myServer another.pdf 9

       is  issued,  a  new  copy  of  xpdf  will not be started.  Instead, the first xpdf (the server) will load
       <u>another.pdf</u> and display page nine.  If the file name is the same:

              xpdf -remote myServer another.pdf 4

       the xpdf server will simply display the specified page.

       The -raise option tells the server to raise its window; it can be specified with or without a  file  name
       and page number.

       The -quit option tells the server to close its window and exit.

</pre><h4><b>USER</b> <b>INTERFACE</b> <b>FONTS</b></h4><pre>
       In  order  to  support international text in user interface elements, xpdf uses the support for UTF-8 and
       Xft fonts that was introduced in OpenMotif 2.3.

       The user interface makes use of four fonts which are specified using Motif  Render  Tables:  <b>default</b>  for
       most text, <b>mono</b> for text in a monospaced font, and <b>helpHuge</b> and <b>helpBig</b> for headings in the About dialog.
       The fonts used can be customised using X resources. By default, they are configured as follows:

           Xpdf*renderTable.default.fontType: FONT_IS_XFT
           Xpdf*renderTable.default.fontName: Sans-Serif
           Xpdf*renderTable.default.fontSize: 12
           Xpdf*renderTable.default.fontEncoding: iso10646-1
           Xpdf*renderTable.helpHuge.fontType: FONT_IS_XFT
           Xpdf*renderTable.helpHuge.fontName: Serif
           Xpdf*renderTable.helpHuge.fontStyle: bold
           Xpdf*renderTable.helpHuge.fontSize: 20
           Xpdf*renderTable.helpHuge.fontEncoding: iso10646-1
           Xpdf*renderTable.helpBig.fontType: FONT_IS_XFT
           Xpdf*renderTable.helpBig.fontName: Serif
           Xpdf*renderTable.helpBig.fontSize: 16
           Xpdf*renderTable.helpBig.fontEncoding: iso10646-1
           Xpdf*renderTable.mono.fontType: FONT_IS_XFT
           Xpdf*renderTable.mono.fontName: Monospace
           Xpdf*renderTable.mono.fontSize: 12
           Xpdf*renderTable.mono.fontEncoding: iso10646-1

       If  you  prefer  to  use  X  core  fonts,  as  in  earlier  versions of xpdf, you can specify these using
       conventional resources, provided that you use fonts with the "iso10646-1" Unicode charset:

           Xpdf*font: -*-helvetica-medium-r-normal-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-iso10646-1
           Xpdf*XmTextField.font: -*-courier-medium-r-normal-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-iso10646-1

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       Xpdf uses the following exit codes:

       0      No error.

       1      Error opening a PDF file.

       99     Other error.
