       arch-test - detect architectures your kernel can run binaries of

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>arch-test</b> [<b>-n</b>]
              enumerates the architectures

       <b>arch-test</b> [<b>-n</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>&lt;chroot&gt;</u>] <u>&lt;arch&gt;</u>
              tests a single arch

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       When  called  without an argument, <b>arch-test</b> outputs the list of architectures executable by your running
       kernel, one per line, using Debian arch names.  <u>Libc</u> or other libraries are neither needed nor checked  —
       an arch is listed if its machine code can be executed and the appropriate syscall ABI is supported by the
       kernel.   This  means,  you  can  run  these architectures in a <u>chroot</u> or a container, execute them using
       multiarch, run static binaries, etc.  The ability to run  additional  architectures  can  be  gained  via
       <u>binfmt</u>s on Linux, Linux emulation on BSD, etc.

       An  architecture  is  considered  runnable only if your kernel can run <u>unmodified</u> binaries, without extra
       steps such as recompiling (Raspbian armhf) or using <b>brandelf</b> on  binaries  you'd  want  to  run  (FreeBSD
       emulation  of  Linux).   Also,  as  Debian requires 686 on i386 as of the stretch release, 686 support is
       checked for.

       If <b>-n</b> is specified, <b>arch-test</b> will try to disable known emulators (currently <b>qemu</b> and <b>wine</b>).  Note that a
       whole-machine emulator appears to be native as far as the kernel is concerned.

       With <b>-c</b> <u>&lt;chroot&gt;</u>, the test is done inside a given chroot (qemu-user before 2.12 required the  interpreter
       to live <u>inside</u> the chroot).  Root privileges are required here.

       When  called  with  an  arch  name  as an argument, <b>arch-test</b> tests the specified architecture.  A human-
       friendly message will be printed, and the exit code can be:

       <b>0</b>      congratulations, the arch can be run on your kernel

       <b>1</b>      failure

       <b>2</b>      cannot check — <b>arch-test</b> lacks a helper for this arch

       (Shell hint: with <u>set</u> <u>-e</u> you write: <u>ret=0;</u> <u>arch-test</u> <u>$ARCH</u> <u>||</u> <u>ret=$?</u>)

   <b>Helper</b> <b>programs</b>
       The detection is done by small programs located in <u>/usr/lib/arch-test/</u>.  These programs check whether the
       running kernel can execute binaries of a given architecture.  When run, if successful, each such  program
       prints <u>"ok"</u> on stdout and returns exit code 0.

       When the check fails, these helper programs may die horribly — always with a non-zero exit code.  Usually
       the  kernel will notice the incompatibility and nicely abort the attempt, but in some near-miss cases the
       failure is more messy, such as <u>SIGILL</u> or <u>SIGSEGV</u>.  If you want to run the helpers directly, you'd want to
       redirect <u>stderr</u> to <u>/dev/null</u> and to disable core dumps (<b>ulimit</b> <b>-c</b> <b>0</b>).

                                                                                                    <u><a href="../man1/arch-test.1.html">arch-test</a></u>(1)
