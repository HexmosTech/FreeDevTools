</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Motion</u>  uses  a  video4linux device or network camera to detect motion. If motion is detected both normal
       and motion pictures can be taken. Motion can also take actions to  notify  you  if  needed.  Creation  of
       automated snapshots is also possible.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c</b>     Full  path  and  filename  of  config  file.   For example:  <u>/home/kurt/motion.conf</u> The default is
              <u>/usr/local/etc/motion</u> unless specified differently when building Motion.   Many  RPMs  and  Debian
              packages will use <u><a href="file:/etc">/etc</a></u> or <u>/etc/motion</u> as the default.

       <b>-h</b>     Show help screen.

       <b>-b</b>     Run in daemon mode.

       <b>-n</b>     Run in non-daemon mode.

       <b>-s</b>     Run in setup mode. Also forces non-daemon mode.

       <b>-d</b>     Run with message log level 1-9.

       <b>-k</b>     Run with message log type 1-9.

       <b>-l</b>     Full path and file name for the log file.

       <b>-p</b>     Full  path  and  filename  for process id file (pid file). E.g /var/run/motion.pid. Default is not

                     can be listed multiple times.  Each camera file should contain the options that are  unique
                     to  that  camera/video  device.   Common options are obtained from the motion.conf file and
                     values are overwritten from each camera file.  While the motion.conf includes  four  sample
                     camera  files, the actual limit of cameras is only dependent upon the machine capabilities.
                     Remember: If you have more than one camera you must have one camera file for each one.  For
                     example,  2  cameras  would  require  3  files:  The  motion.conf file AND camera1.conf and
                     camera2.conf.  only put the options that are unique to each camera  in  the  camera  config

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       Motion responds to the following signals:

       <b>SIGHUP</b> The config file will be reread.

       <b>SIGTERM</b>
              If needed motion will create an movie file of the last event and exit

       <b>SIGUSR1</b>
              Motion will create an movie file of the current event.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Snapshot</b>
              A snapshot is a picture taken at regular intervals independently of any movement in the picture.

       <b>Motion</b> <b>image</b>
              A  "motion"  image/movie shows the pixels that have actually changed during the last frames. These
              pictures are not very useful for normal presentation to the public but they are quite  useful  for
              testing  and  tuning  and  making  mask  files  as you can see exactly where motion sees something
              moving. Motion is shown in greytones. If labelling is enabled the largest area is marked as  blue.
              Smart mask is shown in read.

       <b>Normal</b> <b>image</b>
              A "normal" image is the real image taken by the camera with text overlayed.

       <b>Cameras</b> <b>and</b> <b>config</b> <b>files</b>
              If  Motion  was invoked with command line option -c pathname Motion will expect the config file to
              be as specified. When you specify the config file on the command line with  -c  you  can  call  it
              anything.
              If  you  do  not specify -c or the filename you give Motion does not exist, Motion will search for
              the configuration file called 'motion.conf' in the following order:
              1. Current directory from where motion was invoked
              2. Then in a directory called '.motion' in the current users  home  directory  (shell  environment
              variable $HOME). E.g. /home/goofy/.motion/motion.conf
              3.  The  motion/  subdirectory  inside  the directory defined by the --sysconfdir=DIR when running
              .configure during installation  of  Motion  (If  this  option  was  not  defined  the  default  is
              <a href="file:/usr/local/etc/">/usr/local/etc/</a>)
              If  you  have  write  access  to  /usr/local/etc/motion then the editor recommends having only one
              motion.conf file in the default /usr/local/etc/motion directory.
              Motion has a configuration file in the distribution package called motion-dist.conf. When you  run
              'make install' this files gets copied to the /usr/local/etc/motion directory.
              The configuration file needs to be renamed from motion-dist.conf to motion.conf. The original file
              is  called  motion-dist.conf so that your perfectly working motion.conf file does not accidentally
              get overwritten when you re-install or upgrade to a newer version of Motion.
              If you have more than one camera you should not try and invoke Motion more times. Motion  is  made
              to work with more than one camera in a very elegant way and the way to do it is to create a number
              of  camera config files. Motion will then create an extra thread of itself for each camera. If you
              only have one camera you only need the motion.conf file. The minute you have two or  more  cameras
              you must have one camera config file per camera besides the motion.conf file.
              So  if you have for example two cameras you need motion.conf and two camera config files. Total of
              3 config files.
              An option that is common to all cameras can be placed  in  motion.conf.  (You  can  also  put  all
              parameters in the camera files but that makes a lot of editing when you change a common thing).
              An option that is unique to a camera must be defined in each camera file.
              The  first  camera  is defined in the first camera file called from motion.conf. The 2nd camera is
              defined in the 2nd camera file called from motion.conf etc.
              Any option defined in motion.conf will be used for all cameras except for the cameras in which the
              same option is defined in a camera config file.
              Motion reads its configuration parameters in the following sequence. If the same parameter  exists
              more than one place the last one read wins.
              1.  Motion reads the configuration file motion.conf from the beginning of the file going down line
              by line.
              2. If the option "camera" is defined in motion.conf, the  camera  configuration  file(s)  is/(are)
              read.
              3.  Motion continues reading the rest of the motion.conf file. Any options from here will overrule
              the same option previously defines in a camera config file.
              4. Motion reads the command line option again overruling any previously defined options.
              So always call the camera config files in the end of the motion.conf file. If you  define  options
              in  motion.conf  AFTER  the  camera file calls, the same options in the camera files will never be
              used. So always put the camera file call at the end of motion.conf.
              If motion is built without specific features such as ffmpeg, mysql etc it will ignore the  options
              that belongs to these features. You do not have to remove them or comment them out.
              If  you  run  the  http  control command <a href="http://host">http://host</a>:port/0/config/writeyes, motion will overwrite
              motion.conf and all the camera.conf files by autogenerated config files neatly formatted and  only
              with  the  features  included  that  Motion was built with. If you later re-build Motion with more
              features or upgrade to a new version, you can use your old config files, run the motion.conf.write
              command, and you will have new config files with the new options included all set to their default
