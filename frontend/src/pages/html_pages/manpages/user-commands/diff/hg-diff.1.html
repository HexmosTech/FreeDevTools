</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       hg diff - diff repository (or selected files)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       hg diff [OPTION]... ([-c REV] | [--from REV1] [--to REV2]) [FILE]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Show differences between revisions for the specified files.

       Differences between files are shown using the unified diff format.

       Note   <b>hg</b>  <b>diff</b> may  generate  unexpected results for merges, as it will default to comparing against the
              working directory's first parent changeset if no revisions are specified.   To  diff  against  the
              conflict regions, you can use <u>--config</u> <u>diff.merge=yes</u>.

       By  default,  the  working  directory files are compared to its first parent. To see the differences from
       another revision, use --from. To see the difference to another revision, use --to. For example,  <b>hg</b>  <b>diff</b>
       <b>--from</b> <b>.^</b> will show the differences from the working copy's grandparent to the working copy, <b>hg</b> <b>diff</b> <b>--to</b>
       <b>.</b> will  show  the diff from the working copy to its parent (i.e. the reverse of the default), and <b>hg</b> <b>diff</b>
       <b>--from</b> <b>1.0</b> <b>--to</b> <b>1.2</b> will show the diff between those two revisions.

       Alternatively you can specify -c/--change with a revision to see the changes in that  changeset  relative
       to its first parent (i.e. <b>hg</b> <b>diff</b> <b>-c</b> <b>42</b> is equivalent to <b>hg</b> <b>diff</b> <b>--from</b> <b>42^</b> <b>--to</b> <b>42</b>)

       Without  the  -a/--text  option, diff will avoid generating diffs of files it detects as binary. With -a,
       diff will generate a diff anyway, probably with undesirable results.

       Use the -g/--git option to generate diffs in the git extended diff format. For more information, read  <b>hg</b>
       <b>help</b> <b>diffs</b>.

       Examples:

       • compare a file in the current working directory to its parent:

         hg diff foo.c

       • compare two historical versions of a directory, with rename info:

         hg diff --git --from 1.0 --to 1.2 lib/

       • get change stats relative to the last change on some date:

         hg diff --stat --from "date('may 2')"

       • diff all newly-added files that contain a keyword:

         hg diff "set:added() and grep(GNU)"

       • compare a revision and its parents:

         hg diff -c 9353                  # compare against first parent
         hg diff --from 9353^ --to 9353   # same using revset syntax
         hg diff --from 9353^2 --to 9353  # compare against the second parent

         Returns 0 on success.
