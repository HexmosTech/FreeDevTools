</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       Similar to its <b>git</b> <b>diff</b> counterpart, this command will print diff patches
       of files for packages published to the npm registry.

        • <b>npm</b> <b>diff</b> <b>--diff=&lt;spec-a&gt;</b> <b>--diff=&lt;spec-b&gt;</b>

        Compares two package versions using their registry specifiers, e.g:
        <b>npm</b> <b>diff</b> <b>--diff=<a href="mailto:pkg@1.0.0">pkg@1.0.0</a></b> <b>--diff=pkg@^2.0.0</b>. It's also possible to
        compare across forks of any package,
        e.g: <b>npm</b> <b>diff</b> <b>--diff=<a href="mailto:pkg@1.0.0">pkg@1.0.0</a></b> <b>--diff=<a href="mailto:pkg-fork@1.0.0">pkg-fork@1.0.0</a></b>.

        Any valid spec can be used, so that it's also possible to compare
        directories or git repositories,
        e.g: <b>npm</b> <b>diff</b> <b>--diff=pkg@latest</b> <b>--diff=./packages/pkg</b>

        Here's an example comparing two different versions of a package named
        <b>abbrev</b> from the registry:
          npm diff --diff=<a href="mailto:abbrev@1.1.0">abbrev@1.1.0</a> --diff=<a href="mailto:abbrev@1.1.1">abbrev@1.1.1</a>

        On success, output looks like:
          diff --git a/package.json b/package.json
          index v1.1.0..v1.1.1 100644
          --- a/package.json
          +++ b/package.json
          @@ -1,6 +1,6 @@
           {
             "name": "abbrev",
          -  "version": "1.1.0",
          +  "version": "1.1.1",
             "description": "Like ruby's abbrev module, but in js",
             "author": "Isaac Z. Schlueter &lt;<a href="mailto:i@izs.me">i@izs.me</a>&gt;",
             "main": "abbrev.js",

        Given the flexible nature of npm specs, you can also target local
        directories or git repos just like when using <b>npm</b> <b>install</b>:
          npm diff --diff=https://github.com/npm/libnpmdiff --diff=./local-path

        In the example above we can compare the contents from the package installed
        from the git repo at <b>github.com/npm/libnpmdiff</b> with the contents of the
        <b>./local-path</b> that contains a valid package, such as a modified copy of
        the original.

        • <b>npm</b> <b>diff</b> (in a package directory, no arguments):

        If the package is published to the registry, <b>npm</b> <b>diff</b> will fetch the
        tarball version tagged as <b>latest</b> (this value can be configured using the
        <b>tag</b> option) and proceed to compare the contents of files present in that
        tarball, with the current files in your local file system.

        This workflow provides a handy way for package authors to see what
        package-tracked files have been changed in comparison with the latest
        published version of that package.

        • <b>npm</b> <b>diff</b> <b>--diff=&lt;pkg-name&gt;</b> (in a package directory):

        When using a single package name (with no version or tag specifier) as an
        argument, <b>npm</b> <b>diff</b> will work in a similar way to

        <u>`npm-outdated`</u> and reach for the registry to figure out
        what current published version of the package named <b>&lt;pkg-name&gt;</b>
        will satisfy its dependent declared semver-range. Once that specific
        version is known <b>npm</b> <b>diff</b> will print diff patches comparing the
        current version of <b>&lt;pkg-name&gt;</b> found in the local file system with
        that specific version returned by the registry.

        Given a package named <b>abbrev</b> that is currently installed:
          npm diff --diff=abbrev

        That will request from the registry its most up to date version and
        will print a diff output comparing the currently installed version to this
        newer one if the version numbers are not the same.

        • <b>npm</b> <b>diff</b> <b>--diff=&lt;spec-a&gt;</b> (in a package directory):

        Similar to using only a single package name, it's also possible to declare
        a full registry specifier version if you wish to compare the local version
        of an installed package with the specific version/tag/semver-range provided
        in <b>&lt;spec-a&gt;</b>.

        An example: assuming <b><a href="mailto:pkg@1.0.0">pkg@1.0.0</a></b> is installed in the current <b>node_modules</b>
        folder, running:
          npm diff --diff=<a href="mailto:pkg@2.0.0">pkg@2.0.0</a>

        It will effectively be an alias to
        <b>npm</b> <b>diff</b> <b>--diff=<a href="mailto:pkg@1.0.0">pkg@1.0.0</a></b> <b>--diff=<a href="mailto:pkg@2.0.0">pkg@2.0.0</a></b>.

        • <b>npm</b> <b>diff</b> <b>--diff=&lt;semver-a&gt;</b> <b>[--diff=&lt;semver-b&gt;]</b> (in a package directory):

        Using <b>npm</b> <b>diff</b> along with semver-valid version numbers is a shorthand
        to compare different versions of the current package.

        It needs to be run from a package directory, such that for a package named
        <b>pkg</b> running <b>npm</b> <b>diff</b> <b>--diff=1.0.0</b> <b>--diff=1.0.1</b> is the same as running
        <b>npm</b> <b>diff</b> <b>--diff=<a href="mailto:pkg@1.0.0">pkg@1.0.0</a></b> <b>--diff=<a href="mailto:pkg@1.0.1">pkg@1.0.1</a></b>.

        If only a single argument <b>&lt;version-a&gt;</b> is provided, then the current local
        file system is going to be compared against that version.

        Here's an example comparing two specific versions (published to the
        configured registry) of the current project directory:
          npm diff --diff=1.0.0 --diff=1.1.0

       Note that tag names are not valid <b>--diff</b> argument values, if you wish to
       compare to a published tag, you must use the <b>pkg@tagname</b> syntax.

   <b>Filtering</b> <b>files</b>
       It's possible to also specify positional arguments using file names or globs
       pattern matching in order to limit the result of diff patches to only a subset
       of files for a given package, e.g:
         npm diff --diff=pkg@2 .<a href="file:/lib/">/lib/</a> CHANGELOG.md

       In the example above the diff output is only going to print contents of files
       located within the folder <b>.<a href="file:/lib/">/lib/</a></b> and changed lines of code within the
       <b>CHANGELOG.md</b> file.
