</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mPNGWWTExec - None

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       mPNGWWTExec [-d lev] colorTable tileLevel baseName grayDir gray.hist pngDir

       mPNGWWTExec  -c  [-d  lev]  trueColor  tileLevel  baseName  blueTileDir blue.hist greenTileDir green.hist
       redTileDir red.hist pngDir

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Runs mViewer for all the tiles needed for a WWT TOAST set.  FITS tile  files  should  already  have  been
       generated using mProjWWTExec.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -c     Switches to color mode (different argument set)

       -d <u>level</u>
              Turns on debugging to some level

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       colorTable
              The grayscale color table.  See mViewer docs for details.

       tileLevel
              The depth of WWT TOAST tiles desired.  This should be no bigger than the depth to which FITS files
              were created.

       baseName
              Base  name  for  tiles.  For  instance,  an  output  tile named "planck3102.png" has the base name
              "planck".

       grayDir
              Directory containing grayscale FITS TOAST files, previously created with mProjWWTExec.

       gray.hist
              Histogram used for stretching grayscale FITS files, previously created with mHistogram.

       pngDir Directory for output PNGs.

       trueColor
              Color enhancement  parameter.   See  mViewer  docs  for  details;  set  to  zero  for  no  special
              enhancement.

       tileLevel
              The depth of WWT TOAST tiles desired.  This should be no bigger than the depth to which FITS files
              were created.

       baseName
              Base  name  for  tiles.  For  instance,  an  output  tile named "planck3102.png" has the base name
              "planck".

       blueDir
              Directory containing blue FITS TOAST files, previously created with mProjWWTExec.

       blue.hist
              Histogram used for stretching blue FITS files, previously created with mHistogram.

       greenDir
              Directory containing green FITS TOAST files, previously created with mProjWWTExec.

       green.hist
              Histogram used for stretching green FITS files, previously created with mHistogram.

       redDir Directory containing red FITS TOAST files, previously created with mProjWWTExec.

       red.hist
              Histogram used for stretching red FITS files, previously created with mHistogram.

       pngDir Directory for output PNGs.

</pre><h4><b>RESULT</b></h4><pre>
       Like mProjWWTExec, this utility has a limitation: all the output files are put  in  a  single  directory.
       This  may become unworkable if the tiles go deep enough.  This shortcoming can be easily overcome but the
       details will depend on the details of the input data so we have opted for a simple initial approach.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       OK     [struct stat="OK", level=<u>level</u>, nimage=<u>count</u>]

       ERROR  Problem with FITS file.

       ERROR  Cannot find histogram file [<u>histfile</u>].

       ERROR  [<u>dir</u>] is not a directory.

       ERROR  Problem creating output PNG directory.

       ERROR  Problem with output PNG directory.

       ERROR  <u>mViewer</u> <u>error</u> <u>message</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       $ mPNGWWTExec -d 1 4 4 Planck fits gray.hist pngs
              [struct stat="OK", level=4, nimage=341]

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The drizzle algorithm has been implemented but has not been tested in this release.

       If a header template contains carriage returns (i.e., created/modified on a Windows machine), the cfitsio
       library will be unable to read it properly, resulting in the  error:  [struct  stat="ERROR",  status=207,
       msg="illegal character in keyword"]

       It  is  best  for  the  background  correction  algorithms  if  the area described in the header template
       completely encloses all of the input images in their entirety. If parts of input images are "chopped off"
       by the header template, the background correction will be affected. We  recommend  you  use  an  expanded
       header  for  the  reprojection  and background modeling steps, returning to the originally desired header
       size for the final coaddition. The default background matching  assumes  that  there  are  no  non-linear
       background  variations  in  the individual images (and therefore in the overlap differences). If there is
       any uncertainty in this regard, it is safer to turn on the "level only"  background  matching  (the  "-l"
       flag in mBgModel.
