</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gendiff - utility to aid in error-free diff file generation

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gendiff</b> &lt;directory&gt; &lt;diff-extension&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gendiff</b> is a rather simple script which aids in generating a diff file from a single directory.  It takes
       a  directory  name  and  a "diff-extension" as its only arguments.  The diff extension should be a unique
       sequence of characters added to the end of all original, unmodified files.  The output of the program  is
       a diff file which may be applied with the <b>patch</b> program to recreate the changes.

       The  usual sequence of events for creating a diff is to create two identical directories, make changes in
       one directory, and then use the <b>diff</b> utility to create a list of  differences  between  the  two.   Using
       gendiff  eliminates  the  need  for the extra, original and unmodified directory copy.  Instead, only the
       individual files that are modified need to be saved.

       Before editing a file, copy the file, appending the extension you have chosen to the filename.  I.e.   if
       you  were  going  to  edit  somefile.cpp and have chosen the extension "fix", copy it to somefile.cpp.fix
       before editing it.  Then edit the first copy (somefile.cpp).

       After editing all the files you need to edit in this fashion, enter the directory one level  above  where
       your source code resides, and then type

                  $ gendiff somedirectory .fix &gt; mydiff-fix.patch

       You should redirect the output to a file (as illustrated) unless you want to see the results on stdout.
