</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       diff - differential file comparator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>diff</b> [ <b>-acefmnbwr</b> ] file1 ... file2

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Diff</u>  tells  what  lines  must  be  changed  in two files to bring them into agreement.  If one file is a
       directory, then a file in that directory with basename the same as that of the other file  is  used.   If
       both  files  are  directories, similarly named files in the two directories are compared by the method of
       <u>diff</u> for text files and <u><a href="../man1/cmp.1.html">cmp</a></u>(1) otherwise.  If more than two file names are given, then each  argument  is
       compared  to  the  last  argument  as  above.   The  <b>-r</b>  option  causes  <u>diff</u>  to process similarly named
       subdirectories recursively.  When processing more than one file, <u>diff</u> prefixes file  differences  with  a
       single line listing the two differing files, in the form of a <u>diff</u> command line.  The <b>-m</b> flag causes this
       behavior even when processing single files.

       The normal output contains lines of these forms:

            <u>n1</u> <b>a</b> <u>n3,n4</u>
            <u>n1,n2</u> <b>d</b> <u>n3</u>
            <u>n1,n2</u> <b>c</b> <u>n3,n4</u>

       These  lines  resemble <u>ed</u> commands to convert <u>file1</u> into <u>file2</u>.  The numbers after the letters pertain to
       <u>file2</u>.  In fact, by exchanging `a' for `d' and reading backward one may ascertain equally how to  convert
       <u>file2</u> into <u>file1</u>.  As in <u>ed</u>, identical pairs where <u>n1</u> = <u>n2</u> or <u>n3</u> = <u>n4</u> are abbreviated as a single number.

       Following each of these lines come all the lines that are affected in the first file flagged by `&lt;', then
       all the lines that are affected in the second file flagged by `&gt;'.

       The  <b>-b</b>  option  causes  trailing  blanks  (spaces and tabs) to be ignored and other strings of blanks to
       compare equal.  The <b>-w</b> option causes all white-space to be removed from input lines before  applying  the
       difference algorithm.

       The  <b>-n</b>  option  prefixes each range with <u>file</u><b>:</b> and inserts a space around the <b>a</b>, <b>c</b>, and <b>d</b> verbs.  The <b>-e</b>
       option produces a script of <u>a,</u> <u>c</u> and <u>d</u> commands for the editor <u>ed</u>, which will recreate <u>file2</u> from  <u>file1</u>.
       The  <b>-f</b>  option produces a similar script, not useful with <u>ed</u>, in the opposite order. It may, however, be
       useful as input to a stream-oriented post-processor.

       The <b>-c</b> option includes three lines of context around each change, merging changes whose contexts overlap.
       The <b>-a</b> flag displays the entire file as context.

       Except in rare circumstances, <u>diff</u> finds a smallest sufficient set of file differences.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/tmp/diff[12]</b>

</pre><h4><b>SOURCE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/src/cmd/diff</b>

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="../man1/cmp.1.html">cmp</a></u>(1), <u><a href="../man1/comm.1.html">comm</a></u>(1), <u><a href="../man1/ed.1.html">ed</a></u>(1)

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Exit status is the empty string for no differences, for some, and for trouble.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Editing scripts produced under the <b>-e</b> or <b>-f</b> option are naive about creating lines consisting of a  single
       `<b>.</b>'.

       When running <u>diff</u> on directories, the notion of what is a text file is open to debate.

                                                                                                    <u><a href="../man1plan9/DIFF.1plan9.html">DIFF</a></u>(1plan9)
