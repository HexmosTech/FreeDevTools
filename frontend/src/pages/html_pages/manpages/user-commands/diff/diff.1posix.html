</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       diff — compare two files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       diff <b>[</b>-c|-e|-f|-u|-C <u>n</u>|-U <u>n</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b>-br<b>]</b> <u>file1</u> <u>file2</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>diff</u>  utility  shall  compare the contents of <u>file1</u> and <u>file2</u> and write to standard output a list of
       changes necessary to convert <u>file1</u> into <u>file2</u>.  This list should be minimal. No output shall be  produced
       if the files are identical.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>diff</u>  utility  shall  conform  to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>12.2</u>, <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-b</b>        Cause any amount of white space at the end of a line to be treated as a single &lt;newline&gt;  (that
                 is, the white-space characters preceding the &lt;newline&gt; are ignored) and other strings of white-
                 space characters, not including &lt;newline&gt; characters, to compare equal.

       <b>-c</b>        Produce output in a form that provides three lines of copied context.

       <b>-C</b> <u>n</u>      Produce  output in a form that provides <u>n</u> lines of copied context (where <u>n</u> shall be interpreted
                 as a positive decimal integer).

       <b>-e</b>        Produce output in a form suitable as input for the <u>ed</u>  utility,  which  can  then  be  used  to
                 convert <u>file1</u> into <u>file2</u>.

       <b>-f</b>        Produce output in an alternative form, similar in format to <b>-e</b>, but not intended to be suitable
                 as input for the <u>ed</u> utility, and in the opposite order.

       <b>-r</b>        Apply  <u>diff</u> recursively to files and directories of the same name when <u>file1</u> and <u>file2</u> are both
                 directories.

                 The <u>diff</u> utility shall detect infinite loops; that is, entering a previously visited  directory
                 that is an ancestor of the last file encountered.  When it detects an infinite loop, <u>diff</u> shall
                 write  a  diagnostic  message  to  standard  error and shall either recover its position in the
                 hierarchy or terminate.

       <b>-u</b>        Produce output in a form that provides three lines of unified context.

       <b>-U</b> <u>n</u>      Produce output in a form that provides <u>n</u> lines of unified context (where <u>n</u> shall be interpreted
                 as a non-negative decimal integer).

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <u>file1</u>, <u>file2</u>
                 A pathname of a file to be compared. If either the <u>file1</u> or <u>file2</u> operand is <b>'-'</b>, the  standard
                 input shall be used in its place.

       If  both  <u>file1</u>  and <u>file2</u> are directories, <u>diff</u> shall not compare block special files, character special
       files, or FIFO special files to any files and shall not compare regular files  to  directories.   Further
       details  are  as specified in <u>Diff</u> <u>Directory</u> <u>Comparison</u> <u>Format</u>.  The behavior of <u>diff</u> on other file types
       is implementation-defined when found in directories.

       If only one of <u>file1</u> and <u>file2</u> is a directory, <u>diff</u> shall be applied to the non-directory  file  and  the
       file  contained  in the directory file with a filename that is the same as the last component of the non-
       directory file.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       The standard input shall be used only if one of the <u>file1</u> or <u>file2</u> operands  references  standard  input.
       See the INPUT FILES section.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The input files may be of any type.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>diff</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> for the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used  to affect the format and contents of diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error and informative messages written to standard output.

       <u>LC_TIME</u>   Determine the locale for affecting the format of file timestamps written with  the  <b>-C</b>  and  <b>-c</b>
                 options.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

       <u>TZ</u>        Determine  the  timezone used for calculating file timestamps written with a context format. If
                 <u>TZ</u> is unset or null, an unspecified default timezone shall be used.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Diff</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Comparison</b> <b>Format</b>
       If both <u>file1</u> and <u>file2</u> are directories, the following output formats shall be used.

       In the POSIX locale, each file that is present  in  only  one  directory  shall  be  reported  using  the
       following format:

           "Only in %s: %s\n", &lt;<u>directory</u> <u>pathname</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>filename</u>&gt;

       In  the  POSIX  locale,  subdirectories  that  are common to the two directories may be reported with the
       following format:

           "Common subdirectories: %s and %s\n", &lt;<u>directory1</u> <u>pathname</u>&gt;,
               &lt;<u>directory2</u> <u>pathname</u>&gt;

       For each file common to the two directories, if the two files are not to be compared: if  the  two  files
       have  the  same  device ID and file serial number, or are both block special files that refer to the same
       device, or are both character special files that refer to the same device, in the POSIX locale the output
       format is unspecified.  Otherwise, in the POSIX locale an unspecified format shall be used that  contains
       the pathnames of the two files.

       For each file common to the two directories, if the files are compared and are identical, no output shall
       be written. If the two files differ, the following format is written:

           "diff %s %s %s\n", &lt;<u>diff_options</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>filename1</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>filename2</u>&gt;

       where &lt;<u>diff_options</u>&gt; are the options as specified on the command line.

       All  directory pathnames listed in this section shall be relative to the original command line arguments.
       All other names of files listed in this section shall be filenames (pathname components).

   <b>Diff</b> <b>Binary</b> <b>Output</b> <b>Format</b>
       In the POSIX locale, if one or both of the files being compared are not text files, it is implementation-
       defined whether <u>diff</u> uses the binary file output format or the other  formats  as  specified  below.  The
       binary  file  output  format  shall  contain  the  pathnames  of  two files being compared and the string
       <b>"differ"</b>.

       If both files being compared are text files, depending on the options specified,  one  of  the  following
       formats shall be used to write the differences.

   <b>Diff</b> <b>Default</b> <b>Output</b> <b>Format</b>
       The  default (without <b>-e</b>, <b>-f</b>, <b>-c</b>, <b>-C</b>, <b>-u</b>, or <b>-U</b> options) <u>diff</u> utility output shall contain lines of these
       forms:

           "%da%d\n", &lt;<u>num1</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>num2</u>&gt;

           "%da%d,%d\n", &lt;<u>num1</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>num2</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>num3</u>&gt;

           "%dd%d\n", &lt;<u>num1</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>num2</u>&gt;

           "%d,%dd%d\n", &lt;<u>num1</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>num2</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>num3</u>&gt;

           "%dc%d\n", &lt;<u>num1</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>num2</u>&gt;

           "%d,%dc%d\n", &lt;<u>num1</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>num2</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>num3</u>&gt;

           "%dc%d,%d\n", &lt;<u>num1</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>num2</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>num3</u>&gt;

           "%d,%dc%d,%d\n", &lt;<u>num1</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>num2</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>num3</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>num4</u>&gt;

       These lines resemble <u>ed</u> subcommands to convert <u>file1</u> into <u>file2</u>.  The  line  numbers  before  the  action
       letters  shall  pertain  to  <u>file1</u>;  those after shall pertain to <u>file2</u>.  Thus, by exchanging <u>a</u> for <u>d</u> and
       reading the line in reverse order, one can also determine how to convert <u>file2</u> into  <u>file1</u>.   As  in  <u>ed</u>,
       identical pairs (where <u>num1</u>= <u>num2</u>) are abbreviated as a single number.

       Following  each  of these lines, <u>diff</u> shall write to standard output all lines affected in the first file
       using the format:

           "&lt; %s", &lt;<u>line</u>&gt;

       and all lines affected in the second file using the format:

           "&gt; %s", &lt;<u>line</u>&gt;

       If there are lines affected in both <u>file1</u> and <u>file2</u> (as with the <b>c</b> subcommand), the changes are separated
       with a line consisting of three &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; characters:

           "---\n"

   <b>Diff</b> <b>-e</b> <b>Output</b> <b>Format</b>
       With the <b>-e</b> option, a script shall be produced that shall, when provided as input to <u>ed</u>,  along  with  an
       appended  <b>w</b>  (write)  command,  convert <u>file1</u> into <u>file2</u>.  Only the <b>a</b> (append), <b>c</b> (change), <b>d</b> (delete), <b>i</b>
       (insert), and <b>s</b> (substitute) commands of <u>ed</u> shall be used  in  this  script.  Text  lines,  except  those
       consisting of the single character &lt;period&gt; (<b>'.'</b>), shall be output as they appear in the file.

   <b>Diff</b> <b>-f</b> <b>Output</b> <b>Format</b>
       With  the <b>-f</b> option, an alternative format of script shall be produced. It is similar to that produced by
       <b>-e</b>, with the following differences:

        1. It is expressed in reverse sequence; the output of <b>-e</b> orders changes from the end of the file to  the
           beginning; the <b>-f</b> from beginning to end.

        2. The  command  form &lt;<u>lines</u>&gt; &lt;<u>command-letter</u>&gt; used by <b>-e</b> is reversed. For example, 10<u>c</u> with <b>-e</b> would be
           <u>c</u>10 with <b>-f</b>.

        3. The form used for ranges of line numbers is &lt;space&gt;-separated, rather than &lt;comma&gt;-separated.

   <b>Diff</b> <b>-c</b> <b>or</b> <b>-C</b> <b>Output</b> <b>Format</b>
       With the <b>-c</b> or <b>-C</b> option, the output format shall consist of affected lines along with surrounding  lines
       of  context.  The  affected lines shall show which ones need to be deleted or changed in <u>file1</u>, and those
       added from <u>file2</u>.  With the <b>-c</b> option, three lines of context, if available, shall be written before  and
       after the affected lines. With the <b>-C</b> option, the user can specify how many lines of context are written.
       The exact format follows.

       The name and last modification time of each file shall be output in the following format:

           "*** %s %s\n", <u>file1</u>, &lt;<u>file1</u> <u>timestamp</u>&gt;
           "--- %s %s\n", <u>file2</u>, &lt;<u>file2</u> <u>timestamp</u>&gt;

       Each  &lt;<u>file</u>&gt;  field  shall be the pathname of the corresponding file being compared. The pathname written
       for standard input is unspecified.

       In the POSIX locale, each &lt;<u>timestamp</u>&gt; field shall be equivalent to the output from the following command:

           date "+%a %b %e %T %Y"

       without the trailing &lt;newline&gt;, executed at the time of last modification of the corresponding  file  (or
       the current time, if the file is standard input).

       Then, the following output formats shall be applied for every set of changes.

       First, a line shall be written in the following format:

           "***************\n"

       Next,  the  range of lines in <u>file1</u> shall be written in the following format if the range contains two or
       more lines:

           "*** %d,%d ****\n", &lt;<u>beginning</u> <u>line</u> <u>number</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>ending</u> <u>line</u> <u>number</u>&gt;

       and the following format otherwise:

           "*** %d ****\n", &lt;<u>ending</u> <u>line</u> <u>number</u>&gt;

       The ending line number of an empty range shall be the number of the preceding line, or 0 if the range  is
       at the start of the file.

       Next,  the  affected  lines  along  with lines of context (unaffected lines) shall be written. Unaffected
       lines shall be written in the following format:

           "  %s", &lt;<u>unaffected_line</u>&gt;

       Deleted lines shall be written as:

           "- %s", &lt;<u>deleted_line</u>&gt;

       Changed lines shall be written as:

           "! %s", &lt;<u>changed_line</u>&gt;

       Next, the range of lines in <u>file2</u> shall be written in the following format if the range contains  two  or
       more lines:

           "--- %d,%d ----\n", &lt;<u>beginning</u> <u>line</u> <u>number</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>ending</u> <u>line</u> <u>number</u>&gt;

       and the following format otherwise:

           "--- %d ----\n", &lt;<u>ending</u> <u>line</u> <u>number</u>&gt;

       Then,  lines  of  context  and changed lines shall be written as described in the previous formats. Lines
       added from <u>file2</u> shall be written in the following format:

           "+ %s", &lt;<u>added_line</u>&gt;

   <b>Diff</b> <b>-u</b> <b>or</b> <b>-U</b> <b>Output</b> <b>Format</b>
       The <b>-u</b> or <b>-U</b> options behave like the <b>-c</b> or <b>-C</b> options, except that the context lines  are  not  repeated;
       instead,  the  context,  deleted,  and  added  lines  are  shown together, interleaved.  The exact format
       follows.

       The name and last modification time of each file shall be output in the following format:

           "--- %s\t%s%s %s\n", file1, &lt;file1 timestamp&gt;, &lt;file1 frac&gt;, &lt;file1 zone&gt;
           "+++ %s\t%s%s %s\n", file2, &lt;file2 timestamp&gt;, &lt;file2 frac&gt;, &lt;file2 zone&gt;

       Each &lt;<u>file</u>&gt; field shall be the pathname of the corresponding file being compared, or the single character
       <b>'-'</b> if standard input is being compared. However, if the pathname contains a &lt;tab&gt; or a &lt;newline&gt;, or  if
       it  does  not  consist  entirely  of  characters  taken  from the portable character set, the behavior is
       implementation-defined.

       Each &lt;<u>timestamp</u>&gt; field shall be equivalent to the output from the following command:

           date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'

       without the trailing &lt;newline&gt;, executed at the time of last modification of the corresponding  file  (or
       the current time, if the file is standard input).

       Each  &lt;<u>frac</u>&gt;  field  shall  be  either  empty, or a decimal point followed by at least one decimal digit,
       indicating the fractional-seconds part (if any) of the file timestamp. The number  of  fractional  digits
       shall be at least the number needed to represent the file's timestamp without loss of information.

       Each  &lt;<u>zone</u>&gt;  field shall be of the form <b>"shhmm"</b>, where <b>"shh"</b> is a signed two-digit decimal number in the
       range -24 through +25, and <b>"mm"</b> is an unsigned two-digit decimal number in the range 00 through  59.   It
       represents  the  timezone  of the timestamp as the number of hours (hh) and minutes (mm) east (+) or west
       (-) of UTC for the timestamp.  If the hours and minutes are both zero, the sign shall be  <b>'+'</b>.   However,
       if  the  timezone is not an integral number of minutes away from UTC, the &lt;<u>zone</u>&gt; field is implementation-
       defined.

       Then, the following output formats shall be applied for every set of changes.

       First, the range of lines in each file shall be written in the following format:

           "@@ -%s +%s @@", &lt;file1 range&gt;, &lt;file2 range&gt;

       Each &lt;<u>range</u>&gt; field shall be of the form:

           "%1d", &lt;beginning line number&gt;

       or:

           "%1d,1", &lt;beginning line number&gt;

       if the range contains exactly one line, and:

           "%1d,%1d", &lt;beginning line number&gt;, &lt;number of lines&gt;

       otherwise. If a range is empty, its beginning line number shall be the number of the line just before the
       range, or 0 if the empty range starts the file.

       Next, the affected lines along with lines of context shall be written.  Each  non-empty  unaffected  line
       shall be written in the following format:

           " %s", &lt;unaffected_line&gt;

       where  the  contents  of  the  unaffected  line  shall be taken from <u>file1</u>.  It is implementation-defined
       whether an empty unaffected line is written as an empty line  or  a  line  containing  a  single  &lt;space&gt;
       character.  This  line  also  represents  the  same  line  of <u>file2</u>, even though <u>file2</u>'s line may contain
       different contents due to the <b>-b</b>.  Deleted lines shall be written as:

           "-%s", &lt;deleted_line&gt;

       Added lines shall be written as:

           "+%s", &lt;added_line&gt;

       The order of lines written shall be the same as that of the corresponding  file.  A  deleted  line  shall
       never be written immediately after an added line.

       If  <b>-U</b>  <u>n</u> is specified, the output shall contain no more than 2<u>n</u> consecutive unaffected lines; and if the
       output contains an affected line and this line is adjacent to up to <u>n</u> consecutive unaffected lines in the
       corresponding file, the output shall contain these unaffected lines.  <b>-u</b> shall act like <b>-U</b>3.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    No differences were found.

        1    Differences were found.

       &gt;1    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       If lines at the end of a file are changed and other lines are added, <u>diff</u>  output  may  show  this  as  a
       delete  and  add,  as  a  change, or as a change and add; <u>diff</u> is not expected to know which happened and
       users should not care about the difference in output as long as it clearly shows the differences  between
       the files.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       If  <b>dir1</b>  is a directory containing a directory named <b>x</b>, <b>dir2</b> is a directory containing a directory named
       <b>x</b>, <b>dir1/x</b> and <b>dir2/x</b> both contain files named <b>date.out</b>, and <b>dir2/x</b> contains a file named <b>y</b>, the command:

           diff -r dir1 dir2

       could produce output similar to:

           Common subdirectories: dir1/x and dir2/x
           Only in dir2/x: y
           diff -r dir1/x/date.out dir2/x/date.out

           &gt; Tue Jun 19 21:41:39 PDT 1990

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>-h</b> option was omitted because it was insufficiently  specified  and  does  not  add  to  applications
       portability.

       Historical  implementations  employ  algorithms that do not always produce a minimum list of differences;
       the current language about making every effort is the best this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 can do,  as  there
       is  no  metric  that  could  be employed to judge the quality of implementations against any and all file
       contents. The statement ``This list should be minimal'' clearly  implies  that  implementations  are  not
       expected  to  provide  the  following  output  when  comparing two 100-line files that differ in only one
       character on a single line:

           1,100c1,100
           all 100 lines from file1 preceded with "&lt; "
           ---
           all 100 lines from file2 preceded with "&gt; "

       The ``Only in'' messages required when the <b>-r</b> option  is  specified  are  not  used  by  most  historical
       implementations  if  the  <b>-e</b>  option  is  also  specified. It is required here because it provides useful
       information that must be provided to update a target directory hierarchy to match a source hierarchy. The
       ``Common subdirectories'' messages are written by System V and 4.3 BSD when the <b>-r</b> option  is  specified.
       They  are allowed here but are not required because they are reporting on something that is the same, not
       reporting a difference, and are not needed to update a target hierarchy.

       The <b>-c</b> option, which writes output in a format using lines of context, has been included. The  format  is
       useful for a variety of reasons, among them being much improved readability and the ability to understand
       difference  changes  when the target file has line numbers that differ from another similar, but slightly
       different, copy. The <u>patch</u> utility is most valuable when working with difference listings using a context
       format. The BSD version of <b>-c</b> takes an optional argument specifying the amount of  context.  Rather  than
       overloading  <b>-c</b>  and  breaking the Utility Syntax Guidelines for <u>diff</u>, the standard developers decided to
       add a separate option for specifying a context diff with a specified amount of context (<b>-C</b>).   Also,  the
       format  for  context  <u>diff</u>s  was  extended  slightly in 4.3 BSD to allow multiple changes that are within
       context lines from each other to be merged together.  The  output  format  contains  an  additional  four
       &lt;asterisk&gt; characters after the range of affected lines in the first filename. This was to provide a flag
       for old programs (like old versions of <u>patch</u>) that only understand the old context format. The version of
       context described here does not require that multiple changes within context lines be merged, but it does
       not  prohibit  it either. The extension is upwards-compatible, so any vendors that wish to retain the old
       version of <u>diff</u> can do so by adding the  extra  four  &lt;asterisk&gt;  characters  (that  is,  utilities  that
       currently use <u>diff</u> and understand the new merged format will also understand the old unmerged format, but
       not <u>vice</u> <u>versa</u>).

       The  <b>-u</b>  and  <b>-U</b>  options of GNU <u>diff</u> have been included. Their output format, designed by Wayne Davison,
       takes up less space than <b>-c</b> and <b>-C</b> format, and in many cases is easier to read. The  format's  timestamps
       do not vary by locale, so <u>LC_TIME</u> does not affect it. The format's line numbers are rendered with the <b>%1d</b>
       format,  not  <b>%d</b>,  because  the file format notation rules would allow extra &lt;blank&gt; characters to appear
       around the numbers.

       The substitute command was added as an additional format for the <b>-e</b> option. This  was  added  to  provide
       implementations  with  a  way  to fix the classic ``dot alone on a line'' bug present in many versions of
       <u>diff</u>.  Since many implementations have fixed this bug, the standard developers decided not to standardize
       broken behavior, but rather to provide the necessary tool for fixing the bug. One way to fix this bug  is
       to  output two periods whenever a lone period is needed, then terminate the append command with a period,
       and then use the substitute command to convert the two periods into one period.

       The BSD-derived <b>-r</b> option was added to provide a mechanism for using <u>diff</u>  to  compare  two  file  system
       trees.  This  behavior  is  useful,  is  standard  practice on all BSD-derived systems, and is not easily
       reproducible with the <u>find</u> utility.

       The requirement that <u>diff</u> not compare files in some circumstances, even though they have the  same  name,
       is  based  on  the  actual  output  of  historical implementations.  The specified behavior precludes the
       problems arising from running into FIFOs and other files that would cause <u>diff</u> to hang waiting for  input
       with  no  indication  to  the  user that <u>diff</u> was hung. An earlier version of this standard specified the
       output format more precisely, but in practice this requirement was widely  ignored  and  the  benefit  of
       standardization  seemed  small,  so  it is now unspecified. In most common usage, <u>diff</u> <b>-r</b> should indicate
       differences in the file hierarchies, not the  difference  of  contents  of  devices  pointed  to  by  the
       hierarchies.

       Many  early  implementations  of  <u>diff</u>  require  seekable  files.  Since  the System Interfaces volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 supports  named  pipes,  the  standard  developers  decided  that  such  a  restriction  was
       unreasonable.  Note also that the allowed filename <b>-</b> almost always refers to a pipe.

       No  directory  search  order is specified for <u>diff</u>.  The historical ordering is, in fact, not optimal, in
       that it prints out all of the differences at the current level, including the statements about all common
       subdirectories before recursing into those subdirectories.

       The message:

           "diff %s %s %s\n", &lt;<u>diff_options</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>filename1</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>filename2</u>&gt;

       does not vary by locale because it is the representation of a command, not an English sentence.
