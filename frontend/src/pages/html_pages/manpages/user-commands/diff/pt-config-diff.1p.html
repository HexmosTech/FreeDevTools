</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pt-config-diff - Diff MySQL configuration files and server variables.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: pt-config-diff [OPTIONS] CONFIG CONFIG [CONFIG...]

       pt-config-diff diffs MySQL configuration files and server variables.  CONFIG can be a filename or a DSN.
       At least two CONFIG sources must be given.  Like standard Unix diff, there is no output if there are no
       differences.

       Diff host1 config from SHOW VARIABLES against host2:

         pt-config-diff h=host1 h=host2

       Diff config from [mysqld] section in my.cnf against host1 config:

         pt-config-diff /etc/my.cnf h=host1

       Diff the [mysqld] section of two option files:

          pt-config-diff /etc/my-small.cnf /etc/my-large.cnf

</pre><h4><b>RISKS</b></h4><pre>
       Percona Toolkit is mature, proven in the real world, and well tested, but all database tools can pose a
       risk to the system and the database server.  Before using this tool, please:

       •   Read the tool's documentation

       •   Review the tool's known "BUGS"

       •   Test the tool on a non-production server

       •   Backup your production server and verify the backups

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       pt-config-diff  diffs MySQL configurations by examining the values of server system variables from two or
       more CONFIG sources specified on the command line.  A CONFIG source can be a DSN or a filename containing
       the output of "mysqld --help --verbose", "my_print_defaults", "SHOW VARIABLES", or an option  file  (e.g.
       my.cnf).

       For  each  DSN  CONFIG, pt-config-diff connects to MySQL and gets variables and values by executing "SHOW
       /*!40103 GLOBAL*/ VARIABLES".  This is an "active config" because it shows what server  values  MySQL  is
       actively (currently) running with.

       Only  variables  that  all  CONFIG sources have are compared because if a variable is not present then we
       cannot know or safely guess its value.  For example, if you compare an option file (e.g.  my.cnf)  to  an
       active  config  (i.e.  SHOW  VARIABLES  from a DSN CONFIG), the option file will probably only have a few
       variables, whereas the active config has every variable.  Only values of the variables  present  in  both
       configs are compared.

       Option file and DSN configs provide the best results.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       There  is  no  output when there are no differences.  When there are differences, pt-config-diff prints a
       report to STDOUT that looks similar to the following:

         2 config differences
         Variable                  my.master.cnf   my.slave.cnf
         ========================= =============== ===============
         datadir                   /tmp/12345/data /tmp/12346/data
         port                      12345           12346

       Comparing MySQL variables is difficult because there are many variations and subtleties across  the  many
       versions  and distributions of MySQL.  When a comparison fails, the tool prints a warning to STDERR, such
       as the following:

         Comparing log_error values (mysqld.log, /tmp/12345/data/mysqld.log)
         caused an error: Argument "/tmp/12345/data/mysqld.log" isn't numeric
         in numeric eq (==) at ./pt-config-diff line 2311.

       Please report these warnings so the comparison functions can be improved.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       pt-config-diff exits with a zero exit status when there are no differences, and 1 if there are.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This tool accepts additional command-line arguments.  Refer to the "SYNOPSIS" and usage  information  for
       details.

       --ask-pass
           Prompt for a password when connecting to MySQL.

       --charset
           short form: -A; type: string

           Default  character  set.   If  the  value  is utf8, sets Perl's binmode on STDOUT to utf8, passes the
           mysql_enable_utf8 option to DBD::mysql, and runs SET NAMES UTF8 after connecting to MySQL.  Any other
           value sets binmode on STDOUT without the utf8 layer, and runs SET NAMES after connecting to MySQL.

       --config
           type: Array

           Read this comma-separated list of config files; if specified, this must be the first  option  on  the
           command line.  (This option does not specify a CONFIG; it's equivalent to "--defaults-file".)

       --database
           short form: -D; type: string

           Connect to this database.

       --defaults-file
           short form: -F; type: string

           Only read mysql options from the given file.  You must give an absolute pathname.

       --help
           Show help and exit.

       --host
           short form: -h; type: string

           Connect to host.

       --[no]ignore-case
           default: yes

           Compare the variables case-insensitively.

       --ignore-variables
           type: array

           Ignore, do not compare, these variables.

       --password
           short form: -p; type: string

           Password to use for connection.

       --pid
           type: string

           Create  the  given  PID  file.   The  tool  won't start if the PID file already exists and the PID it
           contains is different than the current PID.  However, if the PID file exists and the PID it  contains
           is  no  longer  running,  the tool will overwrite the PID file with the current PID.  The PID file is
           removed automatically when the tool exits.

       --port
           short form: -P; type: int

           Port number to use for connection.

       --[no]report
           default: yes

           Print the MySQL config diff report to STDOUT.  If you just want to check if  the  given  configs  are
           different  or  not  by  examining  the tool's exit status, then specify "--no-report" to suppress the
           report.

       --report-width
           type: int; default: 78

           Truncate report lines to this many characters.  Since some variable  values  can  be  long,  or  when
           comparing  multiple  configs,  it  may  help to increase the report width so values are not truncated
           beyond readability.

       --set-vars
           type: Array

           Set the MySQL variables in this comma-separated list of "variable=value" pairs.

           By default, the tool sets:

              wait_timeout=10000

           Variables specified on the command line override these defaults.  For example, specifying "--set-vars
           wait_timeout=500" overrides the defaultvalue of 10000.

           The tool prints a warning and continues if a variable cannot be set.

       --socket
           short form: -S; type: string

           Socket file to use for connection.

       --user
           short form: -u; type: string

           MySQL user if not current user.

       --version
           Show version and exit.

       --[no]version-check
           default: yes

           Check for the latest version of Percona Toolkit, MySQL, and other programs.

           This is a standard "check for updates automatically" feature, with two additional  features.   First,
           the  tool  checks  its own version and also the versions of the following software: operating system,
           Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM), MySQL, Perl, MySQL driver for Perl (DBD::mysql), and Percona
           Toolkit. Second, it checks for and warns about versions  with  known  problems.  For  example,  MySQL
           5.5.25 had a critical bug and was re-released as 5.5.25a.

           A  secure connection to Percona's Version Check database server is done to perform these checks. Each
           request is logged by the server, including software version numbers and  unique  ID  of  the  checked
           system.  The  ID  is  generated  by the Percona Toolkit installation script or when the Version Check
           database call is done for the first time.

           Any updates or known problems are printed to STDOUT before the tool's normal  output.   This  feature
           should never interfere with the normal operation of the tool.

</pre><h4><b>DSN</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These  DSN  options are used to create a DSN.  Each option is given like "option=value".  The options are
       case-sensitive, so P and p are not the same option.  There cannot be whitespace before or after  the  "="
       and  if  the  value  contains  whitespace  it  must be quoted.  DSN options are comma-separated.  See the
       percona-toolkit manpage for full details.

       •   A

           dsn: charset; copy: yes

           Default character set.

       •   D

           dsn: database; copy: yes

           Default database.

       •   F

           dsn: mysql_read_default_file; copy: yes

           Only read default options from the given file

       •   h

           dsn: host; copy: yes

           Connect to host.

       •   p

           dsn: password; copy: yes

           Password to use when connecting.  If password contains commas they must be escaped with a  backslash:
           "exam\,ple"

       •   P

           dsn: port; copy: yes

           Port number to use for connection.

       •   S

           dsn: mysql_socket; copy: yes

           Socket file to use for connection.

       •   u

           dsn: user; copy: yes

           User for login if not current user.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The  environment  variable "PTDEBUG" enables verbose debugging output to STDERR.  To enable debugging and
       capture all output to a file, run the tool like:

          PTDEBUG=1 pt-config-diff ... &gt; FILE 2&gt;&amp;1

       Be careful: debugging output is voluminous and can generate several megabytes of output.

</pre><h4><b>SYSTEM</b> <b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       You need Perl, DBI, DBD::mysql, and some core packages that ought to be installed in any  reasonably  new
       version of Perl.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       For a list of known bugs, see &lt;<a href="http://www.percona.com/bugs/pt-config-diff">http://www.percona.com/bugs/pt-config-diff</a>&gt;.

       Please  report bugs at &lt;https://jira.percona.com/projects/PT&gt;.  Include the following information in your
       bug report:

       •   Complete command-line used to run the tool

       •   Tool "--version"

       •   MySQL version of all servers involved

       •   Output from the tool including STDERR

       •   Input files (log/dump/config files, etc.)

       If possible, include debugging output by running the tool with "PTDEBUG"; see "ENVIRONMENT".
