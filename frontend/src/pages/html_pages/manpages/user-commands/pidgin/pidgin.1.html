</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pidgin - Instant Messaging client

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pidgin</b> <u>[options]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pidgin</b> is a graphical modular messaging client based on libpurple which is capable of connecting to XMPP,
       IRC,  SILC,  Novell  GroupWise, Lotus Sametime, Zephyr, Gadu-Gadu, and QQ all at once. It has many common
       features found in other clients, as well as many unique features.

       Pidgin can be extended by plugins written in multiple programming languages and controlled  through  DBus
       or <b>purple-remote</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are provided by Pidgin using the standard GNU command line syntax:

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--config=</b><u>DIR</u>
              Use <u>DIR</u> as the directory for config files instead of <u><a href="file:~/.purple">~/.purple</a></u>.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--debug</b>
              Print  debugging  messages to stdout.  These are the same debugging messages that are displayed in
              the <b>Debug</b> <b>Window</b>.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--force-online</b>
              Try to be online even if the network is reported (by Windows, or NetworkManager on  Linux)  to  be
              unavailable.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Print a summary of command line options and exit.

       <b>-m,</b> <b>--multiple</b>
              Allow multiple instances of Pidgin to run.

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--nologin</b>
              Don't automatically login when Pidgin starts.  Sets the global status to <b>Offline</b>.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--login[=</b><u>NAME</u>,<u>NAME</u>,...]
              Enable  the  comma-separated list of accounts provided, disabling all other accounts.  If the user
              does not specify such a comma-separated list, the first account in accounts.xml will be enabled.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Print the current version and exit.

</pre><h4><b>TERMS</b></h4><pre>
       Pidgin uses a few terms differently from other applications.  For convenience they are defined here:

       <b>Buddy</b> <b>List</b>
              The list of other users who the user wants to see status information for and have quick access  to
              for messaging.

       <b>Buddy</b>  A user who has been added to the Buddy List.

       <b>Contact</b>
              A grouping of more than one buddy who are all the same person.  A contact may contain buddies from
              any protocol and may contain as many buddies as the user desires.  Contact arrangements are stored
              locally only.

       <b>Alias</b>  A  private "nickname" that may be set for Buddies or the user himself.  On some protocols, aliases
              are saved on the server but not visible to other users.  On other  protocols,  aliases  are  saved
              only locally.

       <b>Protocol</b>
              A  messaging  service.   XMPP, Zephyr, etc. are protocols.  Others may call these "service types,"
              "account types," "services," and so on.

</pre><h4><b>BUDDY</b> <b>LIST</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>Buddy</b> <b>List</b> window is Pidgin's main interface window.  Using this window  a  user  can  see  which  of
       his/her buddies is online, away, idle, etc.  The user can also add buddies to and remove buddies from the
       buddy list.

       The  <b>Buddy</b>  <b>List</b> window contains a list of the user's buddies who are online and have allowed the user to
       be notified of their presence.  The icon to the left of each buddy indicates the buddy's current  status.
       Double clicking a buddy will open a new <b>Conversation</b> window.  Right clicking will pop up a menu:

       <b>Get</b> <b>Info</b>
              Retrieves and displays information about the buddy.  This information is also known as a Profile.

       <b>IM</b>     Opens a new <b>Conversation</b> window to the selected buddy.

       <b>Send</b> <b>File</b>
              Sends a file to the selected buddy (only available on protocols that support file transfer).

       <b>Add</b> <b>Buddy</b> <b>Pounce</b>
              A  Buddy Pounce is a configurable automated action to be performed when the buddy's state changes.
              This will open the <b>Buddy</b> <b>Pounce</b> dialog, which will be discussed later.

       <b>View</b> <b>Log</b>
              Pidgin is capable of automatically logging messages.  These logs are either plain text files (with
              a .txt extension) or html  files  (with  a  .html  extension)  located  under  the  <u><a href="file:~/.purple/logs">~/.purple/logs</a></u>
              directory.   This menu command will display Pidgin's log viewer with logs loaded for that buddy or
              chat.

       <b>Alias</b>  Create an alias for this buddy.  This will show an editable text field where the buddy's name  was
              displayed.   In  this  field one can give this buddy an alternate, more friendly name to appear on
              the buddy list and in conversations.

              For example, if a buddy's name was jsmith1281xx and his real name was 'John Q. Smith,'  one  could
              create an alias as to identify the buddy by his common name.

       The  remainder  of the menu will consist of protocol specific commands.  These commands vary depending on
       the protocol.

       <b>Status</b> <b>Selector</b>
              At the bottom of the <b>Buddy</b> <b>List</b> is a status selector which allows one to  change  his/her  status.
              This will be discussed further in the <b>STATUS</b> <b>MESSAGES</b> section below.

</pre><h4><b>ACCOUNT</b> <b>EDITOR</b></h4><pre>
       The  account  editor  consists  of  a list of accounts and information about them.  It can be accessed by
       selecting <b>Manage</b> from the Accounts menu.  Clicking <u>Delete</u> will delete  the  currently  selected  account.
       Clicking  <u>Add</u>  or  <u>Modify</u>  will invoke a <b>Modify</b> <b>Account</b> window.  Here, the user  can add or alter account
       information.  When creating a new account, the user will submit a username and password.  The  user  will
       also choose the protocol for the account.

       If  <u>Remember</u>  <u>Password</u>  is  chosen,  the  password  will  be  saved  in  Pidgin's  <u><a href="file:~/.purple/accounts.xml">~/.purple/accounts.xml</a></u>
       configuration file.

       If <u>Enabled</u> is checked in the accounts dialog, this account will follow the status currently  selected  in
       the status selector.  If it is not checked, the account will always be offline.

       Each protocol has its own specific options that can be found in the modify screen.

</pre><h4><b>PREFERENCES</b></h4><pre>
       All options take effect immediately.

</pre><h4><b>Interface</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Show</b> <b>system</b> <b>tray</b> <b>icon</b>
              Specifies  when  to  show  a  Pidgin  icon  in the notification area of the user's panel (commonly
              referred to as the System Tray).

       <b>Hide</b> <b>new</b> <b>IM</b> <b>conversations</b>
              Specifies when to hide new IM messages.  Messages will queue under the specified  condition  until
              shown.   Clicking  the Pidgin icon in the notification area or system tray will display the queued
              messages.  An icon also appears in the buddy list's menu bar;  this  icon  may  also  be  used  to
              display queued messages.

       <b>Show</b> <b>IMs</b> <b>and</b> <b>chats</b> <b>in</b> <b>tabbed</b> <b>windows</b>
              When checked, this option will cause IM and chat sessions to appear in windows with multiple tabs.
              One  tab  will  represent one conversation or chat.  Where tabs are placed will be dictated by the
              preferences below.

       <b>Show</b> <b>close</b> <b>buttons</b> <b>on</b> <b>tabs</b>
              When checked, this option will cause a clickable "U+2715 MULTIPLICATION X"  unicode  character  to
              appear at the right edge of each tab.  Clicking this will cause the tab to be closed.

       <b>Placement</b>
              Specifies  where  to  place tabs in the window.  Some tab orientations may allow some users to fit
              more tabs into a single window comfortably.

       <b>New</b> <b>conversations</b>
              Specifies under which conditions tabs are placed into existing windows or into new windows.  For a
              single window, select <u>Last</u> <u>created</u> <u>window</u> here.

</pre><h4><b>Conversations</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Enable</b> <b>buddy</b> <b>icon</b> <b>animation</b>
              If a buddy's icon happens to be animated, this option will enable the  animation,  otherwise  only
              the first frame will be displayed.

       <b>Notify</b> <b>buddies</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>typing</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b>
              Some protocols allow clients to tell their buddies when they are typing.  This option enables this
              feature for protocols that supports it.

       <b>Default</b> <b>Formatting</b>
              Allows  specifying  the  default  formatting to apply to all outgoing messages (only applicable to
              protocols that support formatting in messages).

</pre><h4><b>Smiley</b> <b>Themes</b></h4><pre>
       Allows the user to choose between different smiley  themes.  The  "none"  theme  will  disable  graphical
       emoticons - they will be displayed as text instead.  The <b>Add</b> and <b>Remove</b> buttons may be used to install or
       uninstall  smiley  themes.   Themes  may also be installed by dragging and dropping them onto the list of
       themes.

</pre><h4><b>Sounds</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Method</b> Lets the user choose between different playback methods.  The  user  can  also  manually  enter  a
              command to be executed when a sound is to be played(<u>%s</u> expands to the full path to the file name).

       <b>Sounds</b> <b>when</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>has</b> <b>focus</b>
              When  checked,  sounds  will  play for events in the active conversation if the window is focused.
              When unchecked, sounds will not play for the active conversation when the window is focused.

       <b>Enable</b> <b>Sounds</b>
              Determines when to play sounds.

       <b>Sound</b> <b>Events</b>
              Lets the user choose when and what sounds are to be played.

</pre><h4><b>Network</b></h4><pre>
       <b>STUN</b> <b>server</b>
              This allows specifying a server which uses the STUN protocol  to  determine  a  host's  public  IP
              address.  This can be particularly useful for some protocols.

       <b>Autodetect</b> <b>IP</b> <b>address</b>
              When  checked,  causes  Pidign  to attempt to determine the public IP address of the host on which
              Pidgin is running and disables the <b>Public</b> <b>IP</b> text field listed below.

       <b>Public</b> <b>IP</b>
              If <b>Autodetect</b> <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> is disabled, this field allows manually specifying the public IP  address
              for  the  host  on which Pidgin is running.  This is mainly useful for users with multiple network
              interfaces or behind NATs.

       <b>Manually</b> <b>specify</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>ports</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>on</b>
              Specify a range ports to listen on, overriding any defaults.  This is sometimes  useful  for  file
              transfers and Direct IM.

       <b>Proxy</b> <b>Server</b>
              The  configuration  section  to enable Pidgin to operate through a proxy server.  Pidgin currently
              supports SOCKS 4/5 and HTTP proxies.

</pre><h4><b>Browser</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Browser</b>
              Allows the user to select Pidgin's default web  browser.   Firefox,  Galeon,  Konqueror,  Mozilla,
              Netscape  and  Opera  are  supported  natively.   The user can also manually enter a command to be
              executed when a link is clicked (<u>%s</u> expands to the URL).  For example, <u>xterm</u>  <u>-e</u>  <u>lynx</u>  <u>"%s"</u>  will
              open the link with lynx.

       <b>Open</b> <b>link</b> <b>in</b>
              Allows  the  user to specify whether to use an existing window, a new tab, a new window, or to let
              the browser to decide what to do when calling the browser to  open  a  link.   Which  options  are
              available will depend on which browser is selected.

</pre><h4><b>Logging</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Log</b> <b>format</b>
              Specifies  how to log.  Pidgin supports HTML and plain text, but plugins can provide other logging
              methods.

       <b>Log</b> <b>all</b> <b>instant</b> <b>messages</b>
              When enabled, all IM conversations are logged.  This can be overridden on a per-conversation basis
              in the conversation window.

       <b>Log</b> <b>all</b> <b>chats</b>
              When enabled, all chat conversations are logged.  This can be  overridden  on  a  per-conversation
              basis in the conversation window.

       <b>Log</b> <b>all</b> <b>status</b> <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>system</b> <b>log</b>
              When enabled, status changes are logged.

</pre><h4><b>Status</b> <b>/</b> <b>Idle</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Report</b> <b>idle</b> <b>time</b>
              Determines  under  which  conditions  to  report  idle time.  <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>keyboard</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>use</b> uses
              keyboard and mouse activity to determine idle time.  <b>From</b> <b>last</b> <b>sent</b> <b>message</b> uses the time at which
              the user last sent a message in Pidgin to determine idle.  <b>Never</b> disables idle reporting.

       <b>Change</b> <b>status</b> <b>when</b> <b>idle</b>
              When enabled, this uses the  <b>Minutes</b>  <b>before</b>  <b>becoming</b>  <b>idle</b>  and  <b>Change</b>  <b>status</b>  <b>to</b>  preferences
              described below to set status on idle.

       <b>Minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>idle</b>
              Specifies how many minutes of inactivity are required before considering the user to be idle.

       <b>Change</b> <b>status</b> <b>to</b>
              Specifies which "primitive" or "saved" status to use when setting status on idle.

       <b>Use</b> <b>status</b> <b>from</b> <b>last</b> <b>exit</b> <b>at</b> <b>startup</b>
              If  this  is  checked, Pidgin will remember what status was active when the user closed Pidgin and
              restore it at the next run.  When disabled, Pidgin will always set the status selected  in  <b>Status</b>
              <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>at</b> <b>startup</b> at startup.

       <b>Status</b> <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>at</b> <b>startup</b>
              When <b>Use</b> <b>status</b> <b>from</b> <b>last</b> <b>exit</b> <b>at</b> <b>startup</b> is disabled, this specifies which "primitive" or "saved"
              status to use at startup.

</pre><h4><b>CONVERSATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       When  starting  a new conversation, the user is presented with the <b>Conversation</b> window.  The conversation
       appears in the upper text box and the user types his/her message in the lower text box.  Between the  two
       is  a  row  of options, represented by icons.  Some or all buttons may not be active if the protocol does
       not support the specific formatting. From left to right:

       <b>Font</b>   This menu provides font control options for the current conversation.  Size, style, and  face  may
              be configured here.

       <b>Insert</b> This  menu  provides  the ability to insert images, horizontal rules, and links where the protocol
              supports each of these features.

       <b>Smile!</b> Allows the insertion of graphical smileys via the mouse.  This button shows the user a dialog with
              the available smileys for the current conversation.

</pre><h4><b>CHATS</b></h4><pre>
       For protocols that allow it, <b>Chats</b> can be entered through the <u>Buddies</u> menu.

       Additional features available in chat, depending on the protocol are:

       <b>Whisper</b>
              The text will appear in the chat conversation, but it will only be visible to the sender  and  the
              receiver.

       <b>Invite</b> Invite other people to join the chat room.

       <b>Ignore</b> Ignore anything said by the chosen person

       <b>Set</b> <b>Topic</b>
              Set  the  topic  of  the chat room.  This is usually a brief sentence describing the nature of the
              chat--an explanation of the chat room's name.

       <b>Private</b> <b>Message</b> <b>(IM)</b>
              Send a message to a specific person in the chat.  Messages sent this way will not  appear  in  the
              chat window, but instead open a new IM conversation.

</pre><h4><b>STATUS</b> <b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       Most  protocols  allow  for  status  messages.  By using status messages, a user can leave an informative
       message for others to see.  Status and status messages are configured via  the  status  selector  at  the
       bottom of the Buddy List window.  By default the menu shown here is divided into sections for "primitive"
       status  types,  such  as <u>Available</u>, <u>Away</u>, etc.; a few "popular" statuses (including "transient" statuses)
       which have been recently used, and a section which shows <b>New</b> <b>Status...</b> and <b>Saved</b> <b>Statuses...</b> options  for
       more advanced status manipulation.

       <b>Primitive</b> <b>Statuses</b>
              A  primitive  status  is a basic status supported by the protocol.  Examples of primitive statuses
              would be Available, Away, Invisible, etc.  A primitive status can be used to  create  a  <b>Transient</b>
              <b>Status</b>  <b>or</b>  <b>a</b>  <b>Saved</b>  <b>Status</b>,  both explained below.  Essentially, primitive statuses are building
              blocks of more complicated statuses.

       <b>Transient</b> <b>Statuses</b>
              When one of the statuses from the topmost section of the status selector's menu is selected,  this
              creates a transient, or temporary, status.  The status will show in the "popular statuses" section
              in  the menu until it has not been used for a sufficiently long time.  A transient status may also
              be created by selecting <u>New</u> <u>Status...</u> from the status selector's menu, then clicking <u>Use</u> once  the
              user has entered the message.

       <b>Saved</b> <b>Statuses</b>
              Saved  statuses  are  permanent--once  created, they will exist until deleted.  Saved statuses are
              useful for statuses and status messages that will be used on  a  regular  basis.   They  are  also
              useful  for creating complex statuses in which some accounts should always have a different status
              from others.  For example, one might wish to create  a  status  called  "Sleeping"  that  has  all
              accounts set to "Away", then create another status called "Working" that has three accounts set to
              "Away" and another account set to "Available."

       <b>New</b> <b>Status</b> <b>Window</b>
              When the user selects <u>New</u> <u>Status...</u> from the status selector menu, Pidgin presents the user with a
              dialog asking for status-related information.  That information is discussed below:

              <u>Title</u>  - The name of the status that will appear in the status selctor's menu.  If the user clicks
              the <u>Save</u> or <u>Save</u> <u>&amp;</u> <u>Use</u> button, this name will also be shown in the <b>Saved</b> <b>Status</b> <b>Window</b>.  The title
              should be a short description of the status.

              <u>Status</u> - The type of status being created, such as Available, Away, etc.

              <u>Message</u> - The content of the status message.  This is  what  is  visible  to  other  users.   Some
              protocols will allow formatting in some status messages; where formatting is not supported it will
              be stripped to the bare text entered.

              <u>Use</u>  <u>a</u>  <u>different</u> <u>status</u> <u>for</u> <u>some</u> <u>accounts</u> - This allows the creation of complex statuses in which
              some accounts' status differs from that of other accounts.  To use this, the user will  click  the
              expander  to  the  left  of  the text, then select individual accounts which will have a different
              status and/or status message.  When the user selects  an  account,  Pidgin  will  present  another
              status dialog asking for a status and a message just for the selected account.

       <b>Saved</b> <b>Status</b> <b>Window</b>
              When  the user selects <u>Saved</u> <u>Statuses...</u> from the status selector's menu, Pidgin presents a dialog
              that lists all saved statuses.  "Transient" statuses, discussed above, are <u>NOT</u> shown  here.   This
              window  provides  the ability to manage saved statuses by allowing the creation, modification, and
              deletion of saved statuses.  The <u>Use</u>, <u>Modify</u>, and <u>Delete</u>  buttons  here  allow  operation  on  the
              status  selected from the list; the dd button allows creation of a new saved status, and the <u>Close</u>
              button closes the window.

</pre><h4><b>BUDDY</b> <b>POUNCE</b></h4><pre>
       A Buddy Pounce is an automated trigger that occurs when a buddy returns to a normal state  from  an  away
       state.   The <b>Buddy</b> <b>Pounce</b> dialog box can be activated by selecting the <u>Buddy</u> <u>Pounce</u> option from the <b>Tools</b>
       menu. From this dialog, new pounces can be created with the  <b>Add</b>  button  and  existing  pounces  can  be
       removed  with  the  <b>Delete</b> button.  A pounce can be set to occur on any combination of the events listed,
       and any combination of actions can result.  If <u>Pounce</u> <u>only</u> <u>when</u> <u>my</u> <u>status</u> <u>is</u> <u>not</u>  <u>Available</u>  is  checked,
       the  pounce  will  occur  only  if  the  user is set to a non-available status, such as invisible, do not
       disturb, away, etc.  If <u>Recurring</u> is checked, the pounce will remain until removed by the <b>Delete</b> button.

</pre><h4><b>CUSTOM</b> <b>SMILIES</b></h4><pre>
       Pidgin 2.5.0 introduced support for custom smilies on those protocols for which  interested  contributors
       have  developed  support.   The  custom smiley manager can be accessed by selecting <u>Smiley</u> from the <u>Tools</u>
       menu.  From here, custom smilies may be added, edited, or deleted by clicking the <u>Add</u>,  <u>Edit</u>,  or  <u>Delete</u>
       buttons, respectively.

       During a conversation with another user, that user's custom smileys may be added to the user's own custom
       smiley  list  directly from the conversation window by right-clicking the new custom smiley and selecting
       <u>Add</u> <u>Custom</u> <u>Smiley...</u>

</pre><h4><b>PLUGINS</b></h4><pre>
       Pidgin allows for dynamic loading of plugins to add extra functionality to Pidgin.  See <u>plugins/HOWTO</u>  or
       <u><a href="http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/CHowTo">http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/CHowTo</a></u> for information on writing plugins.

       The  plugins  dialog  can  be  accessed  by  selecting <u>Plugins</u> from the <u>Tools</u> menu. Each plugin available
       appears in this dialog with its name, version, and a short summary of its functionality. Plugins  can  be
       enabled  with  the  checkbox  beside  the  name and short description.  More information on the currently
       selected plugin is available by clicking the expander beside the text <u>Plugin</u> <u>Details</u>.   If  the  selected
       plugin  has  preferences  or configuration options, the <u>Configure</u> <u>Plugin</u> button will present the plugin's
       preferences dialog.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b></h4><pre>
       Pidgin allows for plugins to be written in the perl scripting language.  See <u>Perl</u> <u>Scripting</u> <u>HOWTO</u> in  the
       Pidgin documentation for more information about perl scripting.

</pre><h4><b>TCL</b></h4><pre>
       Pidgin allows for plugins to be written in the Tcl scripting language. See <u>plugins/tcl/TCL-HOWTO</u> for more
       information about Tcl scripting.

</pre><h4><b>D-Bus</b></h4><pre>
