</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gcobol</b>  compiles COBOL source code to object code, and optionally produces an executable binary or shared
       object.  As a GCC component, it accepts all options that affect  code-generation  and  linking.   Options
       specific to COBOL are listed below.

       <b>-main</b> <u>filename</u>
                <b>gcobol</b>  will  generate  a  <b>main</b>()  function  as  an  entry point calling the first PROGRAM-ID in
                <u>filename</u>.

                <b>-main</b> is the default.  When none of <b>-nomain</b>, <b>-c</b>, or <b>-shared</b>, is present, an  implicit  <b>-main</b>  is
                inserted into the command line ahead of the first source file name.

       <b>-main=</b><u>filename</u>
                The .o object module for <u>filename</u> will include a <b>main</b>() entry point calling the first PROGRAM-ID
                in <u>filename</u>

       <b>-main=</b><u>filename:program-id</u>
                The  .o  object  module for <u>filename</u> will include a <b>main</b>() entry point that calls the <u>program-id</u>
                entry point

       <b>-nomain</b>  No <b>main</b>() entry point will be generated by this compilation. The <b>-nomain</b> option is  incompatible
                with <b>-main</b>, and is implied by <b>-shared</b>.  It is also implied by <b>-c</b> when there is no <b>-main</b> present.

                See below for examples showing the use of <b>-main</b> and <b>-nomain.</b>

       <b>-D</b> <u>name</u>[<b>=</b><u>expr</u>]
                Define a CDF name (for use with <b>&gt;&gt;IF</b>) to have the value of <u>expr</u>.

       <b>-E</b>       Write  the  CDF-processed COBOL input to standard output in free-form reference format.  Certain
                non-COBOL  markers are included in the output to indicate where copybook  files  were  included.
                For line-number consistency with the input, blank lines are retained.

                Unlike  the  C  compiler, This option does not prevent compilation.  To prevent compilation, use
                the option
                      <b>-fsyntax-only</b>
                also.

       <b>-fdefaultbyte=</b><u>value</u>
                Use <u>value</u>, a number between 0 and 255, as the default value for all WORKING-STORAGE  data  items
                that have no VALUE clause.  By default, alphanumeric data items are initialized with blanks, and
                numeric data items are initialized to zero.  This option overrides the default with <u>value</u>.

       <b>-fsyntax-only</b>
                Invoke only the parser. Check the code for syntax errors, but don't do anything beyond that.

       <b>-copyext</b> <u>ext</u>
                For the CDF directive
                      COPY <u>name</u>
                if  <u>name</u>  is  unquoted, several varieties of <u>name</u> are tried, as described below under <u>Copybooks</u>.
                The <b>-copyext</b> option extends the names searched to include <u>ext</u>.  If <u>ext</u> is all uppercase  or  all
                lowercase,  both  forms  are  tried, with preference given to the one supplied. If <u>ext</u> is mixed-
                case, only that version is tried.  For example, with
                      <b>-copyext</b> <u>.abc</u>
                given the CDF directive
                      COPY name
                <b>gcobol</b> will add to possible names searched ‘name.abc’ and ‘name.ABC’ in that order.

       <b>-ffixed-form</b>
                Use strict <u>Reference</u> <u>Format</u> in reading the COBOL input: 72-character lines, with  a  6-character
                sequence area, and an indicator column.  Data past column 72 are ignored.

       <b>-ffree-form</b>
                Force  the  COBOL input to be interpreted as <u>free</u> <u>format</u>.  Line breaks are insignificant, except
                that ‘*’ at the start of a line acts as a comment marker.  Equivalent to <b>-indicator-column</b> <u>0</u>.

       <b>-findicator-column</b>
                describes the location of the Indicator Area in a COBOL file  in  <u>Reference</u>  <u>Format</u>,  where  the
                first  6  columns  — known as the “Sequence Number Area” — are ignored, and the 7th column — the
                Indicator Area — may hold a character of significance to the compiler.

                Although <u>reference</u> <u>format</u>, strictly speaking, ignores data after column  72,  with  this  option
                <b>gcobol</b> accepts long COBOL lines, sometimes known as <u>extended</u> <u>source</u> <u>format</u>.  Text past column 72
                is  treated  as ordinary COBOL text.  (Line continuation remains in effect, however, provided no
                text appears <u>past</u> column 72.)

                There is no maximum line length.  Regardless of source code format,  the  entire  program  could
                appear on one line.

                By  default, <b>gcobol</b> auto-detects the source code format by examining the <u>sequence</u> <u>number</u> <u>area</u> of
                the first line of the first file: if those characters are all digits  or  blanks,  the  file  is
                assumed to be in <u>reference</u> <u>format</u>, with the indicator area in column 7.

       <b>-fcobol-exceptions</b> <u>exception</u> [,<u>exception</u>...]
                By  default,  no  exception condition is enabled (including fatal ones), and by the ISO standard
                exception conditions are enabled only via the CDF <b>TURN</b> directive.  This option  enables  one  or
                more exception conditions by default, as though <b>TURN</b> had appeared at the top of the first source
                code file.  This option may also appear more than once on the command line.

                The  value  of <u>exception</u> is a Level 1, 2, or 3 exception condition name, as described by ISO/IEC
                1989:2023.  ‘EC-ALL’ means enable all exceptions.

                The <b>-fno-cobol-exceptions</b> form turns off <u>exception</u>, just as though
                      &gt;&gt;TURN <u>exception</u> <u>CHECKING</u> <u>OFF</u>
                had appeared.

                Not all exception conditions are implemented.  Any that are not produce a warning message.

       <b>-fmax-errors</b> <u>nerror</u>
                <u>nerror</u> represents the number of error messages produced.  Without this option,  <b>gcobol</b>  attempts
                to  recover  from a syntax error by resuming compilation at the next statement, continuing until
                end-of-file.  With it, <b>gcobol</b> counts the messages as they're produced, and stops when <u>nerror</u>  is
                reached.

       <b>-fstatic-call</b>, <b>-fno-static-call</b>
                With <b>-fno-static-call</b>, <b>gcobol</b> never uses static linking for
                      <b>CALL</b> <u>program</u>
                By  default,  or  with  <b>-fstatic-call</b>, if <u>program</u> is an alphanumeric literal, <b>gcobol</b> uses static
                linkage, meaning the compiler produces an external symbol <u>program</u> for  the  linker  to  resolve.
                (In  the future, that will work with <b>CONSTANT</b> data items, too.)  With static linkage, if <u>program</u>
                is not supplied by the source code module or another object file or library at build  time,  the
                linker  will  produce  an  “unresolved symbol” error.  With <b>-fno-static-call</b>, <b>gcobol</b> always uses
                dynamic linking.

                This option affects the <b>CALL</b> statement for literals only.  If <u>program</u>  is  a  non-constant  data
                item,  it  is  always  resolved  using  dynamic  linking,  with  <u><a href="../man3/dlsym.3.html">dlsym</a></u>(3),  because its value is
                determined at run time.

       <b>-dialect</b> <u>dialect-name</u>
                By default, <b>gcobol</b> accepts COBOL syntax as defined by ISO/IEC 1989:2023,  with  some  extensions
                for  backward  compatibility  with  COBOL-85.   To make the compiler more generally useful, some
                additional syntax is supported by this option.

                The value of <u>dialect-name</u> may be
                ibm     to indicate IBM COBOL 6.3 syntax, specifically
                              STOP &lt;number&gt;.
                gnu     to indicate GnuCOBOL syntax
                mf      to indicate MicroFocus syntax, specifically <b>LEVEL</b> <b>78</b> constants.

                Only a few such non-standard constructs are accepted, and <b>gcobol</b> makes no claim to emulate other
                compilers.  But to the extent that a feature is popular but nonstandard, this option provides  a
                way to support it, or add it.

       <b>-include</b> <u>filename</u>
                Process <u>filename</u> as if
                      COPY “<u>filename</u>”
                appeared as the first line of the primary source file.  If <u>filename</u> is not an absolute path, the
                directory  searched  is  the  current  working  directory, not the directory containing the main
                source file.  The name is used  verbatim.  No  permutations  are  applied,  and  no  directories
                searched.

                If  multiple  <b>-include</b> options are given, the files are included in the order they appear on the
                command line.

       <b>-preprocess</b> <u>preprocess-filter</u>
                After all CDF text-manipulation has been applied, and before the prepared COBOL is sent  to  the
                <b>cobol1</b>  compiler,  the input may be further altered by one or more filters.  In the tradition of
                <u><a href="../man1/sed.1.html">sed</a></u>(1), each <u>preprocess-filter</u> reads from standard input and writes to standard output.

                To supply options to <u>preprocess-filter</u>, use a comma-separated  string,  similar  to  how  linker
                options  are  supplied  to <b>-Wl</b>.  (Do not put any spaces after the commas, because the shell will
                treat  it  as  an  option  separator.)   <b>gcobol</b>  replaces  each  comma   with   a   space   when
                <u>preprocess-filter</u> is invoked.  For example,
                      <b>-preprocess</b> <b>tee,output.cbl</b>
                invokes  <u><a href="../man1/tee.1.html">tee</a></u>(1)  with the output filename argument <u>output.cbl</u>, causing a copy of the input to be
                written to the file.

                <b>gcobol</b> searches the current working directory and the PATH environment variable directories  for
                an  executable file whose name matches <u>preprocess-filter</u>.  The first one found is used.  If none
                is found, an error is reported and the compiler is not invoked.

                The <b>-preprocess</b> option may appear more than once on the command line.  Each <u>preprocess-filter</u> is
                applied in turn, in order of appearance.

                The <u>preprocess-filter</u> should return a zero exit status, indicating success.   If  it  returns  a
                nonzero exit status, an error is reported and the compiler is not invoked.

       <b>-fflex-debug</b>, <b>-fyacc-debug</b>
                produce  messages useful for compiler development.  The <b>-fflex-debug</b> option prints the tokenized
                input stream.  The <b>-fyacc-debug</b> option shows the shift and reduce actions taken by the parser.

</pre><h4><b>COMPILATION</b> <b>SCENARIOS</b></h4><pre>
             gcobol <u>xyz.cob</u>
             gcobol -main <u>xyz.cob</u>
             gcobol -main=<u>xyz.cob</u> <u>xyz.cob</u>
       These are equivalent.  The <u>xyz.cob</u> code is compiled and a <b>main</b>() function  is  inserted  that  calls  the
       first PROGRAM-ID in the <u>xyz.cob</u> source file.

             gcobol -nomain <u>xyz.cob</u> <u>elsewhere.o</u>
       The  <b>-nomain</b>  option  prevents  a  <b>main</b>() function from being generated by the gcobol compiler.  A <b>main</b>()
       entry point must be present in the <u>elsewhere.o</u> module; without it the linker will report a “missing main”
       error.

             gcobol <u>aaa.cob</u> <u>bbb.cob</u> <u>ccc.cob</u>
             gcobol -main <u>aaa.cob</u> <u>bbb.cob</u> <u>ccc.cob</u>
       The two commands are equivalent. The three source code modules are compiled  and  linked  together  along
       with a generated <b>main</b>() function that calls the first PROGRAM-ID in the <u>aaa.cob</u> module.

             gcobol <u>aaa.cob</u> <u>bbb.cob</u> <b>-main</b> <u>ccc.cob</u>
             gcobol -main=<u>ccc.cob</u> <u>aaa.cob</u> <u>bbb.cob</u> <u>ccc.cob</u>
       These  two  commands  have  the  same result: An <u>a.out</u> executable is created that starts executing at the
       first PROGRAM-ID in <u>ccc.cob</u>.

             gcobol -main=<u>bbb.cob:b-entry</u> <u>aaa.cob</u> <u>bbb.cob</u> <u>ccc.cob</u>
       An <u>a.out</u> executable is created that starts executing at the PROGRAM-ID <u>b-entry</u>.

             gcobol -c <u>aaa.cob</u>
             gcobol -c -main <u>bbb.cob</u>
             gcobol -c <u>ccc.cob</u>
             gcobol <u>aaa.o</u> <u>bbb.o</u> <u>ccc.o</u>
       The first three commands each create a .o file. The <u>bbb.o</u> file will contain a  <b>main</b>()  entry  point  that
       calls the first PROGRAM-ID in <u>bbb</u>.  The fourth links the three .o files into an <u>a.out</u>.

</pre><h4><b>EBCDIC</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>-finternal-ebcdic</b>  option  is useful when working with mainframe COBOL programs intended for EBCDIC-
       encoded files.  With this option, while the COBOL text remains in ASCII, the character literals and field
       initial values produce EBCDIC strings in the compiled binary, and any character data read from a file are
       interpreted as EBCDIC data.  The file data are not <u>converted</u>; rather, the file is assumed to  use  EBCDIC
       representation.  String  literals  in  the  COBOL  text  <u>are</u>  converted,  so  that  they  can be compared
       meaningfully with data in the file.

       Only file data and character literals are affected.  Data read from and written to  the  environment,  or
       taken  from the command line, are interpreted according the <u><a href="../man7/locale.7.html">locale</a></u>(7) in force during execution. The same
       is true of <b>ACCEPT</b> and <b>DISPLAY</b>.  Names known to the operating system, such as file names and the names  of
       environment variables, are processed verbatim.

       At the present time, this is an all-or-nothing setting.  Support for <b>USAGE</b> and <b>CODESET</b>, which would allow
       conversion between encodings, remains a future goal.

       See also “Feature-set Variables”, below.

</pre><h4><b>REDEFINES</b> <b>...</b> <b>USAGE</b> <b>POINTER</b></h4><pre>
       Per  ISO,  an  item that <b>REDEFINES</b> another may not be larger than the item it redefines, unless that item
       has LEVEL 01 and is not EXTERNAL.  In <b>gcobol</b>, using <b>-dialect</b> <u>ibm</u>, this rule is relaxed for <b>REDEFINES</b> with
       <b>USAGE</b> <b>POINTER</b> whose redefined member is a 4-byte <b>USAGE</b> <b>COMP-5</b> (usually <b>PIC</b>  <b><a href="../man8/S9.8.html">S9</a>(8)</b>),  or  vice-versa.   In
       that  case,  the  redefined  member  is re-sized to be 8 bytes, to accommodate the pointer.  This feature
       allows pointer arithmetic on a 64-bit system with source code targeted at a 32-bit system.

       See also “Feature-set Variables”, below.

</pre><h4><b>IMPLEMENTATION</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gcobol</b> is a gcc compiler, and follows gcc conventions where applicable.  Sometimes those conventions (and
       user expectations) conflict with common Mainframe practice.  Unless required of the compiler by  the  ISO
       specification, any such conflicts are resolved in favor of gcc.

   <b>Linking</b>
       Unlike, C, the COBOL <b>CALL</b> statement implies dynamic linking, because for
             <b>CALL</b> <u>program</u>
       <u>program</u>  can  be  a  variable  whose  value is determined at runtime.  However, the parameter may also be
       compile-time constant, either an alphanumeric literal, or a <b>CONSTANT</b> data item.

       <b>gcobol</b> supports static linking where possible, unless defeated by  <b>-fno-static-call</b>.   If  the  parameter
       value is known at compile time, the compiler produces an external reference to be resolved by the linker.
       The  referenced  program is normally supplied via an object module, a static library, or a shared object.
       If it is not supplied, the linker will report an “unresolved symbol” error, either at build time  or,  if
       using a shared object, when the program is executed.  This feature informs the programmer of the error at
       the earliest opportunity.

       Programs  that are expected to execute correctly in the presence of an unresolved symbol (perhaps because
       the program logic won't require that particular <b>CALL</b>) can use the <b>-no-static-call</b>  option.   That  forces
       all <b>CALL</b> statements to be resolved dynamically, at runtime.

   <b>Implemented</b> <b>Exception</b> <b>Conditions</b>
       Not  all  Exception Conditions are implemented.  Any attempt to enable an EC that that is not implemented
       produces a warning message.  The following are implemented:

            EC-FUNCTION-ARGUMENT
                    for the following functions:
                    ACOS
                    ANNUITY
                    ASIN
                    LOG
                    LOG10
                    PRESENT-VALUE
                    SQRT
            EC-SORT-MERGE-FILE-OPEN
            EC-BOUND-SUBSCRIPT
                    subscript not an integer, less than 1, or greater than occurs
            EC-BOUND-REF-MOD
                    refmod start not an integer, start less than 1, start greater than variable size, length not
                    an integer, length less than 1, and start+length exceeds variable size
            EC-BOUND-ODO
                    DEPENDING not an integer,  greater than occurs upper limit, less than  occurs  lower  limit,
                    and subscript greater than DEPENDING for sending item
            EC-SIZE-ZERO-DIVIDE
                    for both fixed-point and floating-point division
            EC-SIZE-TRUNCATION
            EC-SIZE-EXPONENTIATION

       As  of this writing, no COBOL compiler documents a complete implementation of ISO/IEC 1989:2023 Exception
       Conditions.  <b>gcobol</b> will give priority to those ECs that the user community deems most valuable.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENSIONS</b> <b>TO</b> <b>ISO</b> <b>COBOL</b></h4><pre>
       Standard COBOL has no provision for environment variables as defined by Unix and Windows, or command-line
       arguments.  <b>gcobol</b> supports them using syntax similar to that of  GnuCOBOL.   ISO  and  IBM  also  define
       incompatible  ways  to  return  the  program's  exit status to the operating system.  <b>gcobol</b> supports IBM
       syntax.

   <b>Environment</b> <b>Variables</b>
       To read an environment variable:

             ACCEPT <u>target</u> <b>FROM</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <u>envar</u>

       where <u>target</u> is a data item defined in <b>DATA</b> <b>DIVISION</b>, and <u>envar</u> names an environment variable.  <u>envar</u> may
       be a string literal or alphanumeric data item whose value is the name of  an  environment  variable.  The
       value of the named environment variable is moved to <u>target</u>.  The rules are the same as for <b>MOVE</b>.

       To write an environment variable:

             SET ENVIRONMENT <u>envar</u> <b>TO</b> <u>source</u>

       where  <u>source</u>  is  a  data item defined in <b>DATA</b> <b>DIVISION</b>, and <u>envar</u> names an environment variable.  <u>envar</u>
       again may be a string literal or alphanumeric data item  whose  value  is  the  name  of  an  environment
       variable. The value of the named environment variable is set to the value of <u>source</u>.

   <b>Command-line</b> <b>Arguments</b>
       To  read  command-line  arguments,  use  the  registers  <b>COMMAND-LINE</b> and <b>COMMAND-LINE-COUNT</b> in an <b>ACCEPT</b>
       statement (only).  Used without a subscript, <b>COMMAND-LINE</b> returns the whole  command  line  as  a  single
       string.   With  a  subscript,  <b>COMMAND-LINE</b>  is  a  table of command-line arguments.  For example, if the
       program is invoked as

             <b>./program</b> <b>-i</b> <u>input</u> <u>output</u>

       then

             ACCEPT target FROM <a href="../man3/COMMAND-LINE.3.html">COMMAND-LINE</a>(3)

       moves <u>input</u> into <u>target</u>.  The program name is the first thing in the whole command line and is  found  in
       <a href="../man1/COMMAND-LINE.1.html">COMMAND-LINE</a>(1) <b>COMMAND-LINE</b> table.

       To discover how many arguments were provided on the command line, use

             ACCEPT <u>target</u> <b>FROM</b> <b>COMMAND-LINE-COUNT</b>

       If  <b>ACCEPT</b>  refers  to  a nonexistent environment variable or command-line argument, the target is set to
       <b>LOW-VALUES</b>.

       The system command line parameters can also be accessed through the LINKAGE SECTION in the program  where
       execution starts.  The data structure looks like this:

               linkage         section.
               01   argc       pic 999.
               01   argv.
                02  argv-table   occurs 1 to 100 times depending on argc.
                 03 argv-element pointer.
               01   argv-string  pic <a href="../man100/x.100.html">x</a>(100) .
       and the code to access the third parameter looks like this

               procedure division using by value argc by reference argv.
               set address of argv-string to <a href="../man3/argv-element.3.html">argv-element</a>(3)
               display argv-string

   <b>#line</b> <b>directive</b>
       The parser accepts lines in the form
             #line <u>lineno</u> “<u>filename</u>”.
       The  effect  is  to  set  the  current  line number to <u>lineno</u> and the current input filename to <u>filename</u>.
       Preprocessors may use this directive to control the filename and line numbers reported in error  messages
       and in the debugger.

   <b>SELECT</b> <b>...</b> <b>ASSIGN</b> <b>TO</b>
       In the phrase

             ASSIGN TO <u>filename</u>

       <u>filename</u>  may  appear  in  quotes  or not.  If quoted, it represents a filename as known to the operating
       system.  If unquoted, it names either a data element or an environment variable containing the name of  a
       file.   If  <u>filename</u>  matches  the  name  of a data element, that element is used.  If not, resolution of
       <u>filename</u> is deferred until runtime, when the name must appear in the program's environment.

   <b>Exit</b> <b>Status</b>
       <b>gcobol</b> supports the ISO syntax for returning an exit status to the operating system,

       In  addition,  <b>gcobol</b>  also supports the IBM syntax for returning an exit status to the operating system.
       Use the <b>RETURN-CODE</b> register:

                    <u>convention</u> may be one of:
                    <b>COBOL</b>   Use  standard COBOL case-insensitive symbol-name matching.  For <b>CALL</b> “<u>name</u>”, <u>name</u> is
                            rendered by the compiler in lowercase.

                    makes <u>alias</u> a synonym for <u>keyword</u>.

       &gt;&gt;<b>COBOL-WORDS</b> <b>UNDEFINE</b> <u>keyword</u>
                    <u>keyword</u>  is  removed  from  the  COBOL grammar. Use of it in a program will provoke a syntax
                    error from the compiler.

       &gt;&gt;<b>COBOL-WORDS</b> <b>SUBSTITUTE</b> <u>keyword</u> <b>BY</b> <u>new-word</u>
                    <u>keyword</u> is deleted as a keyword  from  the  grammar,  replaced  by  <u>new-word</u>.   <u>keyword</u>  may
                    thereafter be used as a user-defined word.

       &gt;&gt;<b>COBOL-WORDS</b> <b>RESERVE</b> <u>new-word</u>
                    Treat <u>new-word</u> as a COBOL keyword.  It cannot be used by the program, either as a keyword or
                    as a user-defined word.

       &gt;&gt;<b>DISPLAY</b> <u>string</u> <u>...</u>
                    Write <u>string</u> to standard error as a warning message.

       &gt;&gt;<b>SOURCE</b> <u>format</u>

                    connectors  <u>file</u>.   If  <b>LOCATION</b> is specified, <b>gcobol</b> reports at runtime the source filename
                    and line number of the statement that triggered the exception condition.

   <b>Feature-set</b> <b>Variables</b>
       Some command-line options affect CDF <u>feature-set</u> variables that are special to <b>gcobol</b>.  They can  be  set
       and  tested  using  <b>&gt;&gt;DEFINE</b>  and  <b>&gt;&gt;IF</b>,  and  are  distinguished  by a leading ‘%’ in the name, which is
       otherwise invalid in a COBOL identifier:

       <b>%EBCDIC-MODE</b>
               is set by <b>-finternal-ebcdic</b>.
       <b>%64-BIT-POINTER</b>
               is implied by <b>-dialect</b> <b>ibm</b>.

       To set a feature-set variable, use
             <b>&gt;&gt;SET</b> <u>feature</u> <b>[AS]</b> <b>{ON</b> | <b>OFF}</b>
       If <u>feature</u> is <b>%EBCDIC-MODE</b>, the directive must appear before <b>PROGRAM-ID</b>.

       To test a feature-set variable, use
             <b>&gt;&gt;IF</b> <u>feature</u> <b>DEFINED</b>

   <b>Copybooks</b>
       <b>gcobol</b> supports the CDF <b>COPY</b> statement, with or without its <b>REPLACING</b> component.  For any statement

             COPY <u>copybook</u>

       <b>gcobol</b> looks first for an environment variable named <u>copybook</u> and, if found, uses the  contents  of  that
       variable  as the name of the copybook file.  If that file does not exist, it continues looking for a file
       named one of:

            <b>•</b>   <u>copybook</u> (literally)
            <b>•</b>   <u>copybook.cpy</u>
            <b>•</b>   <u>copybook.CPY</u>
            <b>•</b>   <u>copybook.cbl</u>
            <b>•</b>   <u>copybook.CBL</u>
            <b>•</b>   <u>copybook.cob</u>
            <b>•</b>   <u>copybook.COB</u>

       in that order.  It looks first in  the  same  directory  as  the  source  code  file,  and  then  in  any
       <u>copybook-path</u>  named  with the <b>-I</b> option.  <u>copybook-path</u> may (like the shell's PATH variable) be a colon-
       separated list.  The  <b>-I</b>  option  may  occur  multiple  times  on  the  command  line.   Each  successive
       <u>copybook-path</u>  is  concatenated  to  previous  ones.  Relative paths (having no leading ‘/’) are searched
       relative to the compiler's current working directory.

       For example,

             <b>-I</b> <b><a href="file:/usr/local/include">/usr/local/include</a>:include</b>

       searches first the directory where the COBOL program is found, next in <u><a href="file:/usr/local/include">/usr/local/include</a></u>, and finally in
       an <u>include</u> subdirectory of the directory from which <b>gcobol</b> was invoked.

   <b>Intrinsic</b> <b>functions</b>

   <b>Binary</b> <b>floating</b> <b>point</b> <b>DISPLAY</b>
       How the DISPLAY presents binary floating point numbers depends on the value.

       When a value has six or fewer decimal digits to the left  of  the  decimal  point,  it  is  expressed  as
       <u>123456.789...</u>.

       When  a  value  is less than 1 and has no more than three zeroes to the right of the decimal point, it is
       expressed as <u>0.0001234...</u>.

       Otherwise, exponential notation is used: <u>1.23456E+7</u>.

       In all cases, trailing zeroes on the right of the number are removed from the displayed value.

       COMP-1          displayed with 9 decimal digits.
       COMP-2          displayed with 17 decimal digits.
       FLOAT-EXTENDED  displayed with 36 decimal digits.

       Those digit counts are consistent with the IEEE 754 requirements for  information  interchange.   As  one
       example, the description for COMP-2 binary64 values (per Wikipedia).

       If  an  IEEE  754  double-precision  number is converted to a decimal string with at least 17 significant
       digits, and then converted back to double-precision representation,  the  final  result  must  match  the
       original number.

       17 digits was chosen so that the <b>DISPLAY</b> statement shows the contents of a COMP-2 variable without hiding
       any information.

   <b>Binary</b> <b>floating</b> <b>point</b> <b>MOVE</b>
       During  a  <b>MOVE</b>  statement,  a floating-point value may be truncated.  It will not be unusual for Numeric
       Display values to be altered when moved through a floating-point value.

       This program:

           01 PICV999 PIC 9999V999.
           01 COMP2 COMP-2.
          PROCEDURE DIVISION.
           MOVE 1.001 to PICV999
           MOVE PICV999 TO COMP2
           DISPLAY "The result of MOVE " PICV999 " TO COMP2 is   " COMP2
           MOVE COMP2 to PICV999
           DISPLAY "The result of MOVE COMP2    TO PICV999 is " PICV999

       generates this result:

           The result of MOVE 0001.001 TO COMP2 is   1.00099999999999989
           The result of MOVE COMP2    TO PICV999 is 0001.000

       However, the internal implementation can produce results that might be seem surprising:

           The result of MOVE 0055.110 TO COMP2 is   55.1099999999999994
           The result of MOVE COMP2    TO PICV999 is 0055.110

       The source of this inconsistency is the way <b>gcobol</b> stores and converts numbers.  Converting the floating-
       point value to the numeric display value 0055110 is done by multiplying 55.109999... by  1,000  and  then
       truncating  the  result  to  an integer.  And it turns out that even though 55.11 can’t be represented in
       floating-point as an exact value, the product of the multiplication, 55110, is an exact value.

       In cases where it is important for conversions to have predictable results, we need to be able  to  apply
       rounding, which can be done with an arithmetic statement:

           MOVE 1.001 to PICV999
           MOVE PICV999 TO COMP2
           DISPLAY "The result of MOVE " PICV999 " TO COMP2 is   " COMP2
           MOVE COMP2 to PICV999
           DISPLAY "The result of MOVE COMP2    TO PICV999 is " PICV999
           ADD COMP2 to ZERO GIVING PICV999 ROUNDED
           DISPLAY "The result of ADD COMP2 to ZERO GIVING PICV999 ROUNDED is " PICV999

           The result of MOVE 0001.001 TO COMP2 is   1.00099999999999989
           The result of MOVE COMP2    TO PICV999 is 0001.000
           The result of ADD COMP2 to ZERO GIVING PICV999 ROUNDED is 0001.001

   <b>Binary</b> <b>floating</b> <b>point</b> <b>computation</b>
       <b>gcobol</b> attempts to do internal computations using binary integers when possible.  Thus, simple arithmetic
       between binary values and numeric display values conclude with binary intermediate results.

       If  a  floating-point  value  gets included in the mix of variables specified for a calculation, then the
       intermediate result becomes a 128-bit floating-point value.

   <b>A</b> <b>warning</b> <b>about</b> <b>binary</b> <b>floating</b> <b>point</b> <b>comparison</b>
       The cardinal rule when doing comparisons involving floating-point values: Never, ever, test for equality.
       It’s just not worth the hassle.

       For example:

          WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
           01 COMP1 COMP-1 VALUE 555.11.
           01 COMP2 COMP-2 VALUE 555.11.
          PROCEDURE DIVISION.
           DISPLAY "COMPARE " COMP1 " with " COMP2
           IF COMP1 EQUAL COMP2 DISPLAY "Equal" ELSE DISPLAY "Not equal" END-IF

           MOVE COMP1 to COMP2
           DISPLAY "COMPARE " COMP1 " with " COMP2
           IF COMP1 EQUAL COMP2 DISPLAY "Equal" ELSE DISPLAY "Not equal" END-IF

       the results:

           COMPARE 555.1099854 with 555.110000000000014
           Not equal
           COMPARE 555.1099854 with 555.1099853515625
           Equal

       Why?  Again, it has to do with the internals of <b>gcobol</b>.  When  differently  sized  floating-point  values
       need  to  be compared, they are first converted to 128-bit floats.  And it turns out that when a COMP1 is
       moved to a COMP2, and they are both converted to FLOAT-EXTENDED, the two resulting values are  (probably)
       equal.

       Avoid  testing  for equality unless you really know what you are doing and you really test the code.  And
       then avoid it anyway.

       Finally, it is observably the case that the <b>gcobol</b>  implementations  of  floating-point  conversions  and
       comparisons don’t precisely match the behavior of other COBOL compilers.

       You have been warned.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       COBPATH  If  defined,  specifies  the  directory  paths  to  be  used  by  the  <b>gcobol</b>  runtime  library,
                <u>libgcobol.so</u>, to locate shared objects.  Like LD_LIBRARY_PATH, it may contain several  directory
                names separated by a colon (‘:’).  COBPATH is searched first, followed by LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

                Each directory is searched for files whose name ends in ‘.so’.  For each such file, <u><a href="../man3/dlopen.3.html">dlopen</a></u>(3) is
                attempted,  and,  if  successful <u><a href="../man3/dlsym.3.html">dlsym</a></u>(3).  No relationship is defined between the symbol's name
                and the filename.

                Without COBPATH, binaries produced by <b>gcobol</b> behave as one might expect of any program  compiled
                with  gcc.   Any  shared  objects needed by the program are mentioned on the command line with a
                <b>-l</b><u>library</u> option, and are found by  following  the  executable's  <u>RPATH</u>  or  otherwise  per  the
                configuration of the runtime linker, <u><a href="../man8/ld.so.8.html">ld.so</a></u>(8).

       UPSI     COBOL  defines  a  User Programmable Status Indicator (UPSI) switch. In <b>gcobol</b>, the settings are
                denoted <b>UPSI-0</b> through <b>UPSI-7</b>, where 0-7 indicates a  bit  position.   The  value  of  the  UPSI
                switches is taken from the UPSI environment variable, whose value is a string of up to eight 1's
                and 0's.  The first character represents the value of <b>UPSI-0</b>, and missing values are assigned 0.
                For  example, <b>UPSI=1000011</b> in the environment sets bits 0, 5, and 6 on, which means that <b>UPSI-0</b>,
                <b>UPSI-5</b>, and <b>UPSI-6</b> are on.

       GCOBOL_TEMPDIR
                causes any temporary files created during CDF processing to be written to a file whose  name  is
                specified  in  the  value of GCOBOL_TEMPDIR.  If the value is just “/”, the effect is different:
                each copybook read is reported on standard error.   This  feature  is  meant  to  help  diagnose
                mysterious copybook errors.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Executables produced by <b>gcobol</b> require the runtime support library <u>libgcobol</u>, which is provided both as a
       static library and as a shared object.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       The ISO standard leaves the default file organization up to the implementation; in <b>gcobol</b>, the default is
       <b>SEQUENTIAL</b>.

   <b>On-Disk</b> <b>Format</b>
       Any  ability to use files produced by other COBOL compilers, or for those compilers to use files produced
       by <b>gcobol</b>, is the  product  of  luck  and  intuition.   Various  compilers  interpret  the  ISO  standard
       differently, and the standard's text is not always definitive.

       For  <b>ORGANIZATION</b> <b>IS</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>SEQUENTIAL</b> files (explicitly or by default), <b>gcobol</b>, absent specific direction,
       produces an ordinary Linux text file: for each WRITE, the data are written, followed by an ASCII NL  (hex
       0A) character.  On READ, the record is read up to the size of the specified record or NL, whichever comes
       first.  The  NL  is not included in the data brought into the record buffer; it serves only as an on-disk
       record-termination marker.  Consequently, <b>SEQUENTIAL</b> and <b>LINE</b> <b>SEQUENTIAL</b> files work  the  same  way:  the
       COBOL program never sees the record terminator.

       When  <b>READ</b>  and <b>WRITE</b> are used with <b>ADVANCING</b>, however, the game changes.  If <b>ADVANCING</b> is used with <b>LINE</b>
       <b>SEQUENTIAL</b> files, it is honored by <b>gcobol</b>.

       Other compilers may not do likewise.  According to ISO, in <b>WRITE</b> (14.9.47.3 General rules)  <b>ADVANCING</b>  is
       <u>ignored</u> for files for which “the physical file does not support vertical positioning”.  It further states
       that,  in  the absence of <b>ADVANCING</b>, <b>WRITE</b> proceeds as if “as if the user has specified AFTER ADVANCING 1
       LINE”.  Some other implementations interpret that to mean that the first <b>WRITE</b> to a <b>LINE</b> <b>SEQUENTIAL</b>  file
       results in a leading NL on the first line, and no trailing NL on the last line. Some furthermore <u>prohibit</u>
       the use of <b>ADVANCING</b> with <b>LINE</b> <b>SEQUENTIAL</b> files.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       The reference standard for <b>gcobol</b> is ISO/IEC 1989:2023.
       <b>•</b>   If  <b>gcobol</b>  compiles  code  consistent  with  that  standard,  the  resulting  program should execute
           correctly; any other result is a bug.
       <b>•</b>   If <b>gcobol</b> compiles code that does not comply with that standard, but runs correctly according to some
           other specification, that represents a non-standard extension.  One day, the  <b>-pedantic</b>  option  will
           produce diagnostic messages for such code.
       <b>•</b>   If  <b>gcobol</b> rejects code consistent with that standard, that represents an aspect of COBOL that is (or
           is not) on the To Do list.  If you would like to see  it  compile,  please  get  in  touch  with  the
           developers.

       Where  <b>gcobol</b> passes 100% of the tests in a module, we exclude the (few) tests for obsolete features. The
       authors regard features that were obsolete in 1985 to be well and  truly  obsolete  today,  and  did  not
       implement them.

   <b>Notable</b> <b>deferred</b> <b>features</b>
       CCVS-85  modules not marked with above with any status (CM, and SG) are on the “hard maybe” list, meaning
       they await an interested party with real code using the feature.

       <b>gcobol</b> does not implement Report Writer or Screen Section.

   <b>Beyond</b> <b>COBOL/85</b>
       <b>gcobol</b> increasingly implements ISO/IEC 1989:2023.  For example, <b>DECLARATIVES</b> is not  tested  by  CCVS-85,
       but  are  implemented  by  <b>gcobol</b>.   Similarly, Exception Conditions were not defined in 1985, and <b>gcobol</b>
       contains a growing number of them.

       The authors are well aware that a complete, pure COBOL-85 compiler  won't  compile  most  existing  COBOL
       code.   Every  vendor  offered  (and  offers)  extensions,  and  most  environments  rely on a variety of
       preprocessors and ancillary systems defined outside the standard.  The express  goal  of  adding  an  ISO
       COBOL front-end to GCC is to establish a foundation on which any needed extensions can be built.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       COBOL,  the language, may well be older than the reader.  To the author's knowledge, free COBOL compilers
       first began to appear in 2000.  Around that time an earlier COBOL for GCC project
       <u>cobolforgcc</u>: https://cobolforgcc.sourceforge.net/ met with some success, but was never officially  merged
       into GCC.

       This  compiler,  <b>gcobol</b>,  was  begun  by  <u>COBOLworx</u>:  https://www.cobolworx.com/ in the fall of 2021. The
       project announced a complete implementation of the core language features in December 2022.

       James K. Lowden
               (<a href="mailto:jklowden@cobolworx.com">jklowden@cobolworx.com</a>) is responsible for the parser.
       Robert Dubner
               (<a href="mailto:rdubner@cobolworx.com">rdubner@cobolworx.com</a>) is responsible for producing the GIMPLE tree, which is input to  the  GCC
               back-end.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>•</b>   <b>gcobol</b> has been tested only on x64 and Apple M1 processors running Linux in 64-bit mode.
       <b>•</b>   The  I/O  support  has  not  been extensively tested, and does not implement or emulate many features
           related to VSAM and other mainframe subsystems.  While LINE-SEQUENTIAL files are ordinary text  files
           that  can  be  manipulated with standard utilities, INDEXED and RELATIVE files produced by <b>gcobol</b> are
           not compatible with that of any other COBOL compiler. Enhancements to the I/O support will be readily
           available to the paying customer.
