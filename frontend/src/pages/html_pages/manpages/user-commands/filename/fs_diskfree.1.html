</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fs_diskfree - Shows data about the partition housing a directory or file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fs</b> <b>diskfree</b> [<b>-path</b> &lt;<u>dir/file</u> <u>path</u>&gt;+] [<b>-human</b>] [<b>-help</b>]

       <b>fs</b> <b>df</b> [<b>-p</b> &lt;<u>dir/file</u> <u>path</u>&gt;+] [<b>-hu</b>] [<b>-he</b>]

       <b>fs</b> <b>di</b> [<b>-p</b> &lt;<u>dir/file</u> <u>path</u>&gt;+] [<b>-hu</b>] [<b>-he</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>fs</b> <b>diskfree</b> command formats and displays information about the partition that houses the volume
       containing the specified directory or file, including its size and how much space is currently used.

       To display information about the volume itself, use the <b>fs</b> <b>examine</b> command. The <b>fs</b> <b>examine</b> and <b>fs</b> <b>quota</b>
       commands also display information about a volume.

</pre><h4><b>CAUTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The partition-related statistics in this command's output do not always agree with the corresponding
       values in the output of the standard UNIX <b>df</b> command. The statistics reported by this command can be up
       to five minutes old, because the Cache Manager polls the File Server for partition information at that
       frequency. Also, on some operating systems, the <b>df</b> command's report of partition size includes reserved
       space not included in this command's calculation, and so is likely to be about 10% larger.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-path</b> &lt;<u>dir/file</u> <u>path</u>&gt;+
           Names  a  file  or  directory  that  resides  on the partition about which to produce output. Partial
           pathnames are interpreted relative to the current working directory, which is also the default  value
           if this argument is omitted.

       <b>-human</b>
           Print  space  in  a "human-readable" format. Instead of always printing space in kilobytes, show disk
           space in kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes, or petabytes, as appropriate.

       <b>-help</b>
           Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       The output reports the following information about the volume and partition  that  houses  each  file  or
       directory:

       Volume Name
           The name of the volume.

       total
           The partition's total size. If <b>-human</b> is not specified, this value is in kilobytes.

       used
           The amount of space used on the partition. If <b>-human</b> is not specified, this value is in kilobytes.

       avail
           The  amount  of  space  available  on  the  partition.  If  <b>-human</b> is not specified, this value is in
           kilobytes.

       %used
           The percentage of the partition's total space that is used  (the  "used"  statistic  divided  by  the
           "kbytes" statistic, times 100).

       If the %used statistic is greater than 90%, it is marked with the string "&lt;&lt;WARNING" at the right margin.

       If  the  volume  is  a read-only volume, the output includes information about only one of the partitions
       that houses it, generally the one on the file server machine with the lowest preference rank.  To  verify
       which  machine  the  output is referring to, use the <b>vos</b> <b>listvldb</b> command to list the volume's locations,
       and the <b>vos</b> <b>partinfo</b> command to display the size of each one.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following example  shows  the  output  for  the  partitions  housing  the  volumes  "user.smith"  and
       "sun4x_56.bin":

         % fs diskfree -path /afs/example.com/usr/smith /afs/example.com/sun4x_56/bin
         Volume Name      total    used   avail     %used
         user.smith     4177920 3841258  336662       92% &lt;&lt;WARNING
         sun4x_56.bin   4423680 3174500 1249180       72%

</pre><h4><b>PRIVILEGE</b> <b>REQUIRED</b></h4><pre>
       The issuer must have the "r" (read) permission on the ACL of the root directory of the volume that houses
       the file or directory named by the <b>-path</b> argument, and "l" (list) permission on the ACL of each directory
       that precedes it in the pathname.
