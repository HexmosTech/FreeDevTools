</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       GraphicsMagick's  <b>gm</b>  provides  a  suite  of  utilities for creating, comparing, converting, editing, and
       displaying images.  All of the utilities are provided as sub-commands of a single <b>gm</b> executable.  The  <b>gm</b>
       executable returns the exit code 0 to indicate success, or 1 to indicate failure:

       <b>animate</b> displays an animation (e.g. a GIF file) on any workstation display running an <u>X</u> server.

       <b>batch</b>  executes an arbitrary number of the utility commands (e.g. <b>convert</b>) in the form of a simple linear
       batch script in order to improve execution efficiency, and/or to allow use as  a  subordinate  co-process
       under the control of an arbitrary script or program.

       <b>benchmark</b> executes one of the other utility commands (e.g. <b>convert</b>) for a specified number of iterations,
       or  execution  time,  and reports execution time and other profiling information such as CPU utilization.
       <b>Benchmark</b> provides various operating modes including executing the  command  with  a  varying  number  of
       threads, and alternate reporting formats such as comma-separated value (CSV).

       <b>compare</b>  compares  two  images  and  reports  difference statistics according to specified metrics and/or
       outputs an image with a visual representation of the differences.  It may also be used to test if  images
       are  similar  within  a  particular  range and specified metric, returning a truth value to the executing
       environment.

       <b>composite</b> composites images (blends or merges images together) to create new images.

       <b>conjure</b> interprets and executes scripts in the Magick Scripting Language (MSL).

       <b>convert</b> converts an input file using one image format to an output file with the same or differing  image
       format while applying an arbitrary number of image transformations.

       <b>display</b>  is  a  machine architecture independent image processing and display facility. It can display an
       image on any workstation display running an <u>X</u> server.

       <b>identify</b> describes the format and characteristics of one or more image files. It will also report  if  an
       image is incomplete or corrupt.

       <b>import</b>  reads  an  image  from any visible window on an <u>X</u> server and outputs it as an image file. You can
       capture a single window, the entire screen, or any rectangular portion of the screen.

       <b>mogrify</b> transforms an image or a sequence of  images.  These  transforms  include  <b>image</b>  <b>scaling</b>,  <b>image</b>
       <b>rotation</b>, <b>color</b> <b>reduction</b>, and others. The transmogrified image <b>overwrites</b> the original image.

       <b>montage</b>  creates  a composite by combining several separate images. The images are tiled on the composite
       image with the name of the image optionally appearing just below the individual tile.

       <b>time</b> executes a subcommand and reports the user, system, and total execution time consumed.

       <b>version</b> reports the GraphicsMagick release version, maximum  sample-depth,  copyright  notice,  supported
       features, and the options used while building the software.

       The <b>GraphicsMagick</b> utilities recognize the following image formats:

           Modes:

                     w   Write
                     +   Multi-image

       <u>Support</u>  <u>for</u>  <u>some</u>  <u>of</u>  <u>these</u> <u>formats</u> <u>require</u> <u>additional</u> <u>programs</u> <u>or</u> <u>libraries.</u>  <u>See</u> <u>README</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>source</u>
       <u>package</u> <u>for</u> <u>where</u> <u>to</u> <u>find</u> <u>optional</u> <u>additional</u> <u>software</u>.

       Note, a format delineated with + means that if more than one image is specified, frames are combined into
       a single multi-image file. Use <b>+adjoin</b> if you want a single image produced for each frame.

       Your installation might not support all of the formats in the list.  To get an accurate  listing  of  the
       formats supported by your particular configuration, run "gm convert -list format".

       Raw  images  are  expected  to have one byte per pixel unless <b>gm</b> is compiled in 16-bit quantum mode or in
       32-bit quantum mode. Here, the raw  data  is  expected  to  be  stored  two  or  four  bytes  per  pixel,
       respectively,  in  most-significant-byte-first  order.   For  example, you can tell if <b>gm</b> was compiled in
       16-bit mode by typing "gm version" without any options, and looking for  "Q:16"  in  the  first  line  of
       output.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       By default, the image format is determined by its magic number, i.e., the first few bytes of the file. To
       specify  a  particular  image  format,  precede  the  filename  with  an  image  format  name and a colon
       (<u>i.e.</u><b>ps:image</b>) or specify the image type as the filename suffix (<u>i.e.</u><b>image.ps</b>).  The magic  number  takes
       precedence  over the filename suffix and the prefix takes precedence over the magic number and the suffix
       in input files.  When a file is read, its magic number is  stored  in  the  "image-&gt;magick"  string.   In
       output  files,  the  prefix  takes  precedence  over  the  filename suffix, and the filename suffix takes
       precedence over the "image-&gt;magick" string.

       To read the "built-in" formats (GRANITE, H, LOGO, NETSCAPE, PLASMA, and ROSE) use a prefix (including the
       colon) without a filename or suffix.  To read the XC format, follow the colon with a color specification.
       To read the CAPTION format, follow the colon with a text string or with a filename prefixed with  the  at
       symbol (<b>@</b>).

       When  you specify <b>X</b> as your image type, the filename has special meaning. It specifies an X window by <b>id,</b>
       <b>name</b>, or <b>root</b>. If no filename is specified, the window is selected by clicking the mouse in  the  desired
       window.

       Specify  <u>input_file</u> as <b>-</b> for standard input, <u>output_file</u> as <b>-</b> for standard output.  If <u>input_file</u> has the
       extension <b>.Z</b> or <b>.gz</b>, the file is uncompressed with <b>uncompress</b> or <b>gunzip</b> respectively.  If <u>output_file</u> has
       the extension <b>.Z</b> or <b>.gz</b>, the file is compressed using with <u>compress</u> or <u>gzip</u> respectively.

       Use an optional index enclosed in brackets after an input file name to specify a desired  subimage  of  a
       multi-resolution  image  format  like  Photo  CD (e.g. "img0001.pcd[4]") or a range for MPEG images (e.g.
       "video.mpg[50-75]"). A subimage specification can be disjoint (e.g. "image.tiff[2,7,4]"). For raw images,
       specify a subimage with a geometry (e.g. -size 640x512 "image.rgb[320x256+50+50]").  Surround  the  image
       name  with quotation marks to prevent your shell from interpreting the square brackets. Single images are
       written with the filename you specify. However, multi-part images (e.g., a multi-page PostScript document
       with <b>+adjoin</b> specified) may be written with the scene number included as part of the filename.  In  order
       to  include  the  scene  number  in  the  filename,  it  is necessary to include a printf-style %d format
       specification in the file name and use the +adjoin option. For example,

           image%02d.miff

       writes files <u>image00.miff,</u> <u>image01.miff,</u> etc. Only a single specification is  allowed  within  an  output
       filename.  If  more  than one specification is present, it will be ignored. It is best to embed the scene
       number in the base part of the file name, not in the extension, because  the  extension  will  not  be  a
       recognizable image type.

       When  running  a  commandline utility, you can prepend an at sign @ to a filename to read a list of image
       filenames from that file. This is convenient in the event you have too many image filenames to fit on the
       command line.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options are processed in command line order. Any option you specify on the command line remains in effect
       for the set of images that follows, until the set is terminated by the appearance of any option or <b>-noop</b>.
       Some options only affect the decoding of images and others only the  encoding.   The  latter  can  appear
       after the final group of input images.

       This  is  a  combined  list  of  the  command-line options used by the GraphicsMagick utilities (<u>animate</u>,
       <u>compare</u>, <u>composite</u>, <u>convert</u>, <u>display</u>, <u>identify</u>, <u>import</u>, <u>mogrify</u> and <u>montage</u>).

       In this document, angle brackets ("&lt;&gt;") enclose variables and  curly  brackets  ("{}")  enclose  optional
       parameters. For example, "<b>-fuzz</b> <b>&lt;distance&gt;{%}</b>" means you can use the option "-fuzz 10" or "-fuzz 2%".

       <b>-adjoin</b>
              join images into a single multi-image file

              By  default,  all  images  of an image sequence are stored in the same file. However, some formats
              (e.g. JPEG) do not support storing more than one image per file and only the  first  frame  in  an
              image  sequence  will  be saved unless the result is saved to separate files. Use <b>+adjoin</b> to force
              saving multiple frames to multiple numbered files. If <b>+adjoin</b> is used, then  the  output  filename
              must  include  a  printf style formatting specification for the numeric part of the filename.  For
              example,

                  image%02d.miff

       <b>-affine</b> <u>&lt;matrix&gt;</u>
              drawing transform matrix

              This option provides a transform  matrix  {sx,rx,ry,sy,tx,ty}  for  use  by  subsequent  <b>-draw</b>  or
              <b>-transform</b> options.

       <b>-antialias</b>
              remove pixel aliasing

              By  default antialiasing algorithms are used when drawing objects (e.g. lines) or rendering vector
              formats (e.g. WMF and Postscript). Use +antialias  to  disable  use  of  antialiasing  algorithms.
              Reasons  to  disable  antialiasing  include  avoiding increasing colors in the image, or improving
              rendering speed.

       <b>-append</b>
              append a set of images

              This option creates a single image where the images in the original set are stacked top-to-bottom.
              If they are not of the same width, any narrow images will be expanded to fit using the  background
              color.   Use  <b>+append</b>  to  stack  images  left-to-right.   The  set of images is terminated by the
              appearance of any option.  If the <b>-append</b> option appears after all of the input images, all images
              are appended.

       <b>-asc-cdl</b> <u>&lt;spec&gt;</u>
              apply ASC CDL color transform

              Applies ("bakes in") the ASC CDL, which is a format  for  the  exchange  of  basic  primary  color
              grading  information  between  equipment  and  software  from  different manufacturers. The format
              defines the math for three functions: slope, offset and power. Each function uses a number for the
              red, green, and blue color channels for  a  total  of  nine  numbers  comprising  a  single  color
              decision. The tenth number (optional) is for chromiance (saturation) as specified by ASC CDL 1.2.

              The  argument  string  is  comma  delimited  and is in the following form (but without invervening
              spaces or line breaks)

                  redslope,redoffset,redpower:
                  greenslope,greenoffset,greenpower:
                  blueslope,blueoffset,bluepower:
                  saturation

              with the unity (no change) specification being:

                  "1.0,0.0,1.0:1.0,0.0,1.0:1.0,0.0,1.0:1.0"

       <b>-authenticate</b> <u>&lt;string&gt;</u>
              decrypt image with this password

              Use this option to supply a password for decrypting an image or an image sequence, if it is  being
              read  from  a format such as PDF that supports encryption.  Encrypting images being written is not
              supported.

       <b>-auto-orient</b>
              orient (rotate) image so it is upright

              Adjusts the image orientation so that it is  suitable  for  viewing.   Uses  the  orientation  tag
              obtained from the image file or as supplied by the <b>-orient</b> option.

       <b>-average</b>
              average a set of images

              The  set  of images is terminated by the appearance of any option.  If the <b>-average</b> option appears
              after all of the input images, all images are averaged.

       <b>-backdrop</b>
              display the image centered on a backdrop.

              This backdrop covers the entire workstation screen  and  is  useful  for  hiding  other  X  window
              activity  while  viewing the image. The color of the backdrop is specified as the foreground color
              (X11 default is black).  Refer to "X Resources", below, for details.

       <b>-background</b> <u>&lt;color&gt;</u>
              the background color

              The color is specified using the format described under the <b>-fill</b> option.

       <b>-black-threshold</b> <u>red[,green][,blue][,opacity]</u>
              pixels below the threshold become black

              Use <b>-black-threshold</b> to set pixels with values below the  specified  threshold  to  minimum  value
              (black).  If  only  one  value is supplied, or the red, green, and blue values are identical, then
              intensity thresholding is used. If the color threshold values are not identical then channel-based
              thresholding is used, and color distortion will occur. Specify a negative value (e.g. -1)  if  you
              want  a  channel  to  be  ignored  but  you do want to threshold a channel later in the list. If a
              percent (%) symbol is appended, then the values are treated as a percentage of maximum range.

       <b>-blue-primary</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;,&lt;y&gt;</u>
              blue chromaticity primary point

       <b>-blur</b> <u>&lt;radius&gt;{x&lt;sigma&gt;}</u>
              blur the image with a Gaussian operator

              Blur with the given radius and standard deviation (sigma).

       <b>-border</b> <u>&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;</u>
              surround the image with a border of color

              See <b>-geometry</b> for details about the geometry specification.

       <b>-bordercolor</b> <u>&lt;color&gt;</u>
              the border color

              The color is specified using the format described under the <b>-fill</b> option.

       <b>-borderwidth</b> <u>&lt;geometry&gt;</u>
              the border width

       <b>-box</b> <u>&lt;color&gt;</u>
              set the color of the annotation bounding box

              The color is specified using the format described under the <b>-fill</b> option.

              See <b>-draw</b> for further details.

       <b>-channel</b> <u>&lt;type&gt;</u>
              the type of channel

              Choose from: <b>Red</b>, <b>Green</b>, <b>Blue</b>, <b>Opacity</b>, <b>Matte</b>, <b>Cyan</b>, <b>Magenta</b>, <b>Yellow</b>, <b>Black</b>, or <b>Gray</b>.

              Use this option to extract a particular <u>channel</u> from the image.  <b>Opacity</b>, for example,  is  useful
              for extracting the opacity values from an image.

       <b>-charcoal</b> <u>&lt;factor&gt;</u>
              simulate a charcoal drawing

       <b>-chop</b> <u>&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;{+-}&lt;x&gt;{+-}&lt;y&gt;{%}</u>
              remove pixels from the interior of an image

              <u>Width</u>  and <u>height</u> give the number of columns and rows to remove, and <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> are offsets that give
              the location of the leftmost column and topmost row to remove.

              The <u>x</u> offset normally specifies the leftmost column to remove.  If the <b>-gravity</b> option is  present
              with  <u>NorthEast,</u> <u>East,</u> or <u>SouthEast</u> gravity, it gives the distance leftward from the right edge of
              the image to the rightmost column to remove.  Similarly,  the  <u>y</u>  offset  normally  specifies  the
              topmost  row  to remove, but if the <b>-gravity</b> option is present with <u>SouthWest,</u> <u>South,</u> or <u>SouthEast</u>
              gravity, it specifies the distance upward from the bottom edge of the image to the bottom  row  to
              remove.

              The  <b>-chop</b>  option removes entire rows and columns, and moves the remaining corner blocks leftward
              and upward to close the gaps.

       <b>-clip</b>  apply the clipping path, if one is present

              If a clipping path is present, it will be applied to subsequent operations.

              For example, if you type the following command:

                  gm convert -clip -negate cockatoo.tif negated.tif

              only the pixels within the clipping path are negated.

              The <b>-clip</b> feature requires the XML library.  If the XML library is  not  present,  the  option  is
              ignored.

       <b>-coalesce</b>
              merge a sequence of images

              Each image N in the sequence after Image 0 is replaced with the image created by flattening images
              0 through N.

              The  set of images is terminated by the appearance of any option.  If the <b>-coalesce</b> option appears
              after all of the input images, all images are coalesced.

       <b>-colorize</b> <u>&lt;value&gt;</u>
              colorize the image with the pen color

              Specify the amount of colorization as a percentage. You can apply separate colorization values  to
              the  red,  green,  and  blue  channels  of the image with a colorization value list delimited with
              slashes (e.g. 0/0/50).

              The <b>-colorize</b> option may be used in conjunction with <b>-modulate</b> to produce a nice sepia toned image
              like:

                  gm convert input.ppm -modulate 115,0,100 \
                            -colorize 7,21,50 output.ppm.

       <b>-colormap</b> <u>&lt;type&gt;</u>
              define the colormap type

              Choose between <b>shared</b> or <b>private</b>.

              This option only applies when the default X server visual is <u>PseudoColor</u> or  <u>GRAYScale</u>.  Refer  to
              <b>-visual</b> for more details. By default, a shared colormap is allocated. The image shares colors with
              other  X  clients.   Some  image  colors could be approximated, therefore your image may look very
              different than intended. Choose <b>Private</b> and the image colors appear exactly as they  are  defined.
              However, other clients may go <u>technicolor</u> when the image colormap is installed.

       <b>-colors</b> <u>&lt;value&gt;</u>
              preferred number of colors in the image

              The actual number of colors in the image may be less than your request, but never more. Note, this
              is  a  color reduction option. Images with less unique colors than specified with this option will
              have any duplicate or unused colors removed. The ordering of an  existing  color  palette  may  be
              altered.  When  converting  an  image  from  color  to  grayscale,  convert  the image to the gray
              colorspace before reducing the number of colors since doing so is  most  efficient.  Refer  to  &lt;a
              href="quantize.html"&gt;quantize for more details.

              Note, options <b>-dither</b>, <b>-colorspace</b>, and <b>-treedepth</b> affect the color reduction algorithm.

       <b>-colorspace</b> <u>&lt;value&gt;</u>
              the type of colorspace

              Choices  are:  <b>CineonLog</b>,  <b>CMYK</b>,  <b>GRAY</b>,  <b>HSL</b>, <b>HWB</b>, <b>OHTA</b>, <b>RGB</b>, <b>Rec601Luma</b>, <b>Rec709Luma</b>, <b>Rec601YCbCr</b>,
              <b>Rec709YCbCr</b>, <b>Transparent</b>, <b>XYZ</b>, <b>YCbCr</b>, <b>YIQ</b>, <b>YPbPr</b>, or <b>YUV</b>.

              Color reduction, by default, takes place in the RGB color space. Empirical evidence suggests  that
              distances  in  color  spaces  such  as  YUV or YIQ correspond to perceptual color differences more
              closely than do distances in RGB space.  These color spaces may give  better  results  when  color
              reducing  an  image.  Refer to quantize for more details.  Two gray colorspaces are supported. The
              <b>Rec601Luma</b> space is based on the recommendations for legacy NTSC television (ITU-R BT.601-5).  The
              <b>Rec709Luma</b> space is based on the recommendations for HDTV (Rec. ITU-R BT.709-5)  and  is  suitable
              for  use  with computer graphics, and for contemporary CRT displays. The <b>GRAY</b> colorspace currently
              selects the <b>Rec601Luma</b> colorspace by default for backwards compatibly reasons. This default may be
              re-considered in the future.

              Two YCbCr colorspaces are supported. The <b>Rec601YCbCr</b> space is based  on  the  recommendations  for
              legacy  NTSC television (ITU-R BT.601-5). The <b>Rec709CbCr</b> space is based on the recommendations for
              HDTV (Rec.  ITU-R BT.709-5) and is suitable for suitable for use with computer graphics,  and  for
              contemporary CRT displays. The <b>YCbCr</b> colorspace specification is equivalent to<b>Rec601YCbCr</b>.

              The  <b>Transparent</b>  color space behaves uniquely in that it preserves the matte channel of the image
              if it exists.

              The <b>-colors</b> or <b>-monochrome</b> option, or saving to a file format which requires color  reduction,  is
              required for this option to take effect.

       <b>-comment</b> <u>&lt;string&gt;</u>
              annotate an image with a comment

              Use  this  option  to assign a specific comment to the image, when writing to an image format that
              supports comments. You can include the  image  filename,  type,  width,  height,  or  other  image
              attribute  by embedding special format characters listed under the <b>-format</b> option.  The comment is
              not drawn on the image, but is embedded in the image datastream via a  "Comment"  tag  or  similar
              mechanism.   If  you  want  the  comment  to  be visible on the image itself, use the <b>-draw</b> option
              instead.

              For example,

                   -comment "%m:%f %wx%h"

              produces an image comment of <b>MIFF:bird.miff</b> <b>512x480</b> for an image titled <b>bird.miff</b> and whose  width
              is 512 and height is 480.

              If  the  first  character  of  <u>string</u>  is  <u>@</u>,  the image comment is read from a file titled by the
              remaining characters in the string.  Please note that if the string comes from an untrusted source
              that it should be sanitized before use since otherwise the content of an arbitrary  readable  file
              could be incorporated in a comment in the output file (a security risk).

              If the -comment option appears multiple times, only the last comment is stored.

              In PNG images, the comment is stored in a <b>tEXt</b> or <b>zTXt</b> chunk with the keyword "comment".

       <b>-compose</b> <u>&lt;operator&gt;</u>
              the type of image composition

              The  description of composition uses abstract terminology in order to allow the the description to
              be more  clear,  while  avoiding  constant  values  which  are  specific  to  a  particular  build
              configuration. Each image pixel is represented by red, green, and blue levels (which are equal for
              a gray pixel). MaxRGB is the maximum integral value which may be stored in the red, green, or blue
              channels  of  the  image.  Each  image  pixel  may  also optionally (if the image matte channel is
              enabled) have an associated level of opacity (ranging from opaque to transparent),  which  may  be
              used  to  determine the influence of the pixel color when compositing the pixel with another image
              pixel. If the image matte channel is disabled, then all pixels in the image are treated as opaque.
              The color of an <u>opaque</u> pixel is fully visible while the color of  a  <u>transparent</u>  pixel  color  is
              entirely absent (pixel color is ignored).

              By definition, raster images have a rectangular shape. All image rows are of equal length, and all
              image columns have the same number of rows. By treating the opacity channel as a visual "mask" the
              rectangular  image  may  be given a "shape" by treating the opacity channel as a cookie-cutter for
              the image. Pixels within the shape are opaque, while pixels outside  the  shape  are  transparent.
              Pixels  on  the  boundary  of  the shape may be between opaque and transparent in order to provide
              antialiasing (visually smooth edges). The  description  of  the  composition  operators  use  this
              concept  of  image "shape" in order to make the description of the operators easier to understand.
              While it is convenient to describe the operators in terms of "shapes" they are by no means limited
              to mask-style operations since they are based on continuous floating-point mathematics rather than
              simple boolean operations.

              By default, the <u>Over</u> composite operator is used. The following composite operators are available:

                   Over
                   In
                   Out
                   Atop
                   Xor
                   Plus
                   Minus
                   Add
                   Subtract
                   Difference
                   Divide
                   Multiply
                   Bumpmap
                   Copy
                   CopyRed
                   CopyGreen
                   CopyBlue
                   CopyOpacity
                   CopyCyan
                   CopyMagenta
                   CopyYellow
                   CopyBlack

              The behavior of each operator is described below.

               <b>Over</b>

                    The result will be the union of the two image shapes,  with  opaque  areas  of  <u>change-image</u>
                    obscuring <u>base-image</u> in the region of overlap.

               <b>In</b>

                    The  result is simply <u>change-image</u> cut by the shape of <u>base-image</u>. None of the image data of
                    <u>base-image</u> will be in the result.

               <b>Out</b>

                    The resulting image is <u>change-image</u> with the shape of <u>base-image</u> cut out.

               <b>Atop</b>

                    The result is the same shape as <u>base-image</u>, with <u>change-image</u> obscuring <u>base-image</u> where the
                    image shapes overlap. Note this differs  from  <b>over</b>  because  the  portion  of  <u>change-image</u>
                    outside <u>base-image</u>'s shape does not appear in the result.

               <b>Xor</b>

                    The  result  is  the  image  data  from both <u>change-image</u> and <u>base-image</u> that is outside the
                    overlap region. The overlap region will be blank.

               <b>Plus</b>

                    The result is just the sum of the image data.  Output  values  are  cropped  to  MaxRGB  (no
                    overflow). This operation is independent of the matte channels.

               <b>Minus</b>

                    The  result  of <u>change-image</u> - <u>base-image</u>, with underflow cropped to zero. The matte channel
                    is ignored (set to opaque, full coverage).

               <b>Add</b>

                    The result of <u>change-image</u> + <u>base-image</u>, with overflow wrapping around (<u>mod</u> MaxRGB+1).

               <b>Subtract</b>

                    The result of <u>change-image</u> - <u>base-image</u>, with underflow wrapping around (<u>mod</u> MaxRGB+1).  The
                    <b>add</b> and <b>subtract</b> operators can be used to perform reversible transformations.

               <b>Difference</b>

                    The  result of abs(<u>change-image</u> - <u>base-image</u>). This is useful for comparing two very similar
                    images.

               <b>Divide</b>

                    The result of <u>change-image</u> / <u>base-image</u>. This is useful for  improving  the  readability  of
                    text  on  unevenly  illuminated  photos (by using a gaussian blurred copy of change-image as
                    base-image).

               <b>Multiply</b>

                    The result of <u>change-image</u> * <u>base-image</u>. This is useful for the creation of drop-shadows.

               <b>Bumpmap</b>

                    The result <u>base-image</u> shaded by <u>change-image</u>.

               <b>Copy</b>

                    The resulting image is <u>base-image</u> replaced with <u>change-image</u>. Here the matte information  is
                    ignored.

               <b>CopyRed</b>

                    The  resulting  image  is  the  red  channel  in <u>base-image</u> replaced with the red channel in
                    <u>change-image</u>. The other channels are copied untouched.

               <b>CopyGreen</b>

                    The resulting image is the green channel in <u>base-image</u> replaced with the  green  channel  in
                    <u>change-image</u>. The other channels are copied untouched.

               <b>CopyBlue</b>

                    The  resulting  image  is  the  blue channel in <u>base-image</u> replaced with the blue channel in
                    <u>change-image</u>. The other channels are copied untouched.

               <b>CopyOpacity</b>

                    The resulting image is the opacity channel in <u>base-image</u> replaced with the  opacity  channel
                    in <u>change-image</u>. The other channels are copied untouched.

               <b>CopyCyan</b>

                    The  resulting  image  is  the  cyan channel in <u>base-image</u> replaced with the cyan channel in
                    <u>change-image</u>. The other channels are copied untouched. Use of this  operator  requires  that
                    base-image be in CMYK(A) colorspace.

               <b>CopyMagenta</b>

                    The  resulting  image is the magenta channel in <u>base-image</u> replaced with the magenta channel
                    in <u>change-image</u>. The other channels are copied untouched. Use of this operator requires that
                    base-image be in CMYK(A) colorspace.

               <b>CopyYellow</b>

                    The resulting image is the yellow channel in <u>base-image</u> replaced with the yellow channel  in
                    <u>change-image</u>.  The  other  channels are copied untouched. Use of this operator requires that
                    base-image be in CMYK(A) colorspace.

               <b>CopyBlack</b>

                    The resulting image is the black channel in <u>base-image</u> replaced with the  black  channel  in
                    <u>change-image</u>.  The  other  channels are copied untouched. Use of this operator requires that
                    base-image be in CMYK(A) colorspace. If change-image is not in CMYK space, then the  change-
                    image pixel intensities are used.

       <b>-compress</b> <u>&lt;type&gt;</u>
              the type of image compression

              Choices  are:  <u>None</u>,  <u>BZip</u>,  <u>Fax</u>,  <u>Group3</u>,  <u>Group4</u>, <u>JPEG</u>, <u>Lossless</u>, <u>LZW</u>, <u>RLE</u>, <u>Zip</u>, <u>LZMA</u>, <u>JPEG2000</u>,
              <u>JPEG2000</u>, <u>JBIG</u>, <u>JBIG2</u>, <u>WebP</u>, or <u>ZSTD</u>.

              Specify <b>+compress</b> to store the binary image  in  an  uncompressed  format.   The  default  is  the
              compression type of the specified image file.

              <u>"Lossless"</u>  refers  to lossless JPEG, which is only available if the JPEG library has been patched
              to support it. Use of lossless JPEG is generally not recommended.

              Use the <b>-quality</b> option to set the compression level to be used by the JPEG, JPEG-2000, PNG, MIFF,
              MPEG, and TIFF encoders. Use the <b>-sampling-factor</b> option to set the sampling factor to be used  by
              the DPX, JPEG, MPEG, and YUV encoders for downsampling the chroma channels.

       <b>-contrast</b>
              enhance or reduce the image contrast

              This  option  enhances  the  intensity  differences between the lighter and darker elements of the
              image. Use <b>-contrast</b> to enhance the image or <b>+contrast</b> to reduce the image contrast.

              For a more pronounced effect you can repeat the option:

                  gm convert rose: -contrast -contrast rose_c2.png

       <b>-convolve</b> <u>&lt;kernel&gt;</u>
              convolve image with the specified convolution kernel

              The kernel is specified as a comma-separated list of floating point values, ordered left-to right,
              starting with the top row. The order of the kernel is determined by the square root of the  number
              of entries.  Presently only square kernels are supported.

       <b>-create-directories</b>
              create output directory if required

              Use this option with <b>-output-directory</b> if the input paths contain subdirectories and it is desired
              to  create similar subdirectories in the output directory.  Without this option, <b>mogrify</b> will fail
              if the required output directory does not exist.

       <b>-crop</b> <u>&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;{+-}&lt;x&gt;{+-}&lt;y&gt;{%}</u>
              preferred size and location of the cropped image

              See <b>-geometry</b> for details about the geometry specification.

              The width and height give the size of the image that remains after  cropping,  and  <u>x</u>  and  <u>y</u>  are
              offsets  that  give  the  location of the top left corner of the cropped image with respect to the
              original image.  To specify the amount to be removed, use <b>-shave</b> instead.

              If the <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> offsets are present, a single image is generated, consisting of the pixels from the
              cropping region.  The offsets specify the location of the upper left corner of the cropping region
              measured downward and rightward with respect to the upper  left  corner  of  the  image.   If  the
              <b>-gravity</b>  option  is  present  with  <u>NorthEast,</u>  <u>East,</u> or <u>SouthEast</u> gravity, it gives the distance
              leftward from the right edge of the image to the right edge of the cropping region.  Similarly, if
              the <b>-gravity</b> option is present with <u>SouthWest,</u>  <u>South,</u>  or  <u>SouthEast</u>  gravity,  the  distance  is
              measured upward between the bottom edges.

              If  the <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> offsets are omitted, a set of tiles of the specified geometry, covering the entire
              input image, is generated.  The rightmost tiles and the bottom tiles are smaller if the  specified
              geometry extends beyond the dimensions of the input image.

       <b>-cycle</b> <u>&lt;amount&gt;</u>
              displace image colormap by amount

              <u>Amount</u> defines the number of positions each colormap entry isshifted.

       <b>-debug</b> <u>&lt;events&gt;</u>
              enable debug printout

              The  events  parameter  specifies which events are to be logged.  It can be either None, All, or a
              comma-separated list consisting of one or more of the following domains:  Annotate,  Blob,  Cache,
              Coder,  Configure,  Deprecate,  Error, Exception, FatalError, Information, Locale, Option, Render,
              Resource, TemporaryFile, Transform, User, Warning, or X11, For example,  to  log  cache  and  blob
              events, use

                  gm convert -debug "Cache,Blob" rose: rose.png

              The "User" domain is normally empty, but developers can log "User" events in their private copy of
              GraphicsMagick.

              Use the <b>-log</b> option to specify the format for debugging output.

              Use <b>+debug</b> to turn off all logging.

              An alternative to using <b>-debug</b> is to use the <b>MAGICK_DEBUG</b> environment variable. The allowed values
              for the <b>MAGICK_DEBUG</b> environment variable are the same as for the <b>-debug</b> option.

       <b>-deconstruct</b>
              break down an image sequence into constituent parts

              This  option  compares  each  image  with  the next in a sequence and returns the maximum bounding
              region of any pixel differences it discovers.  This method can undo a coalesced sequence  returned
              by  the  <b>-coalesce</b>  option,  and  is  useful  for removing redundant information from a GIF or MNG
              animation.

              The sequence of images is terminated by the appearance of any option.  If the <b>-deconstruct</b>  option
              appears after all of the input images, all images are deconstructed.

       <b>-define</b> <u>&lt;key&gt;{=&lt;value&gt;},...</u>
              add  coder/decoder  specific  options  This  option creates one or more definitions for coders and
              decoders to use while reading and writing image data. Definitions may  be  passed  to  coders  and
              decoders  to control options that are specific to certain image formats. If <u>value</u> is missing for a
              definition, an empty-valued definition of a flag will be created with that name. This is  used  to
              control  on/off  options.  Use  +define  &lt;key&gt;,...  to  remove definitions previously created. Use
              +define "*" to remove all existing definitions.

              The following definitions may be created:

               <b>bmp:allow-jpeg={true|false}</b>

                    If the bmp:allow-jpeg value is set to true, then enable BMP files  using  JPEG  compression,
                    under  control  of  the  compression  option (which may be JPEG already if the input file is
                    JPEG).  JPEG-compressed BMP files are very rare so this option acts as a safeguard to assure
                    that the current compression setting does not accidentally produce JPEG-compressed BMP files
                    which most other software is unable to read.

               <b>cineon:colorspace={rgb|cineonlog}</b>

                    Use the cineon:colorspace option when reading a Cineon file to specify  the  colorspace  the
                    Cineon file uses. This overrides the colorspace type implied by the DPX header (if any).

               <b>dpx:bits-per-sample=&lt;value&gt;</b>

                    If  the  dpx:bits-per-sample  key  is defined, GraphicsMagick will write DPX images with the
                    specified bits per sample, overriding any existing  depth  value.  If  this  option  is  not
                    specified, then the value is based on the existing image depth value from the original image
                    file.  The  DPX  standard  supports bits per sample values of 1, 8, 10, 12, and 16. Many DPX
                    readers demand a sample size of 10 bits with type A padding (see below).

               <b>dpx:colorspace={rgb|cineonlog}</b>

                    Use the dpx:colorspace option when reading a DPX file to specify the colorspace the DPX file
                    uses. This overrides the colorspace type implied by the DPX header (if any).

               <b>dpx:packing-method={packed|a|b|lsbpad|msbpad}</b>

                    DPX samples are output within 32-bit words. They may be tightly packed end-to-end within the
                    words ("packed"), padded with null bits to the right of the sample  ("a"  or  "lsbpad"),  or
                    padded  with  null bits to the left of the sample ("b" or "msbpad"). This option only has an
                    effect for sample sizes of 10 or 12 bits. If  samples  are  not  packed,  the  DPX  standard
                    recommends  type  A  padding.  Many  DPX readers demand a sample size of 10 bits with type A
                    padding.

               <b>dpx:pixel-endian={lsb|msb}</b>

                    Allows the user to specify the endian order of the pixels when reading or  writing  the  DPX
                    files.  Sometimes this is useful if the file is (or must be) written incorrectly so that the
                    file header and the pixels use different endianness.

               <b>dpx:swap-samples={true|false}</b>

               <b>dpx:swap-samples-read={true|false}</b>

               <b>dpx:swap-samples-write={true|false}</b>

                    GraphicsMagick strives to adhere to the DPX standard but certain aspects of the standard can
                    be quite confusing. As a result, some 10-bit DPX files have Red and Blue interchanged, or Cb
                    and Cr interchanged due to an different interpretation of the standard, or getting the wires
                    crossed. The swap-samples option may be supplied when reading or writing in order to read or
                    write using the necessary sample order.  Use swap-samples-read  when  swapping  should  only
                    occur in the reader, or swap-samples-write when swapping should only occur in the writer.

               <b>heif:ignore-transformations={true|false}</b>

                    Return HEIF (e.g. HEIC/AVIF) image without any transformations (e.g. rotation) applied.

               <b>gradient:direction={South|North|West|East|NorthWest|NorthEast|SouthWest|SouthEast}</b>

                    By  default,  the  gradient  coder  produces a gradient from top to bottom ("South").  Since
                    GraphicsMagick 1.3.35, the gradient direction may be specified to produce  gradient  vectors
                    according  to  a gravity-like specification.  The arguments are <b>South</b> (Top to Bottom), <b>North</b>
                    (Bottom to Top), <b>West</b> (Right to Left), <b>East</b> (Left to Right), <b>NorthWest</b> (Bottom-Right to Top-
                    Left),  <b>NorthEast</b>  (Bottom-Left  to  Top-Right),  <b>SouthWest</b>  (Top-Right  Bottom-Left),   and
                    <b>SouthEast</b> (Top-Left to Bottom-Right).

               <b>jp2:rate=&lt;value&gt;</b>

                    Specify  the compression factor to use while writing JPEG-2000 files. The compression factor
                    is the reciprocal of the compression ratio.  The  valid  range  is  0.0  to  1.0,  with  1.0
                    indicating  lossless compression. If defined, this value overrides the -quality setting. The
                    default quality setting of 75 results in a rate value of 0.06641.

               <b>jpeg:arithmetic-coding={true|false}</b>

                    Enables or disables arithmetic encoding if the JPEG library supports it (default  disabled).
                    When this is enabled, optimize-coding is necessarily disabled.

               <b>jpeg:block-smoothing={true|false}</b>

                    Enables or disables block smoothing when reading a JPEG file (default enabled).

               <b>jpeg:dct-method=&lt;value&gt;</b>

                    Selects the IJG JPEG library DCT implementation to use. The encoding implementations vary in
                    speed  and  encoding error. The available choices for <b>value</b> are <b>islow</b>, <b>ifast</b>, <b>float</b>, <b>default</b>
                    and <b>fastest</b>. Note that <b>fastest</b> might not necessarily be fastest on your  CPU,  depending  on
                    the choices made when the JPEG library was built and how your CPU behaves.

               <b>jpeg:fancy-upsampling={true|false}</b>

                    Enables or disables fancy upsampling when reading a JPEG file (default enabled).

               <b>jpeg:data-precision=&lt;value&gt;</b>

                    Selects  the  JPEG sample storage size.  Normal JPEG uses 8. Turbo-jpeg and some variants of
                    IJG JPEG also support 12 and 16 bits.

               <b>jpeg:lossless-precision=&lt;value&gt;</b>

                    Selects a degree of precision to use while performing DPCM-based compression.  The available
                    range 0 to precision-1.  For example, if the output depth is 16, then the available range is
                    0 to 15.  When the precision is non-zero, then the pixels are right-shifted  to  effectively
                    support  fewer bits (fewer colors), but offering an improved compression ratio.  Use a value
                    of 0 to achieve lossless compression.

               <b>jpeg:lossless-predictor=&lt;value&gt;</b>

                    Selects the predictor to use for lossless compression.  The  supported  values  are  in  the
                    range  of  1  to  7  and  select  a  pre-defined predictor algorithm to use, which considers
                    surrounding pixels. The best predictor for a particular image depends on the image.

               <b>jpeg:max-scan-number=&lt;value&gt;</b>

                    Specifies an integer value for the maximum number of progressive scans  allowed  in  a  JPEG
                    file.   The  default  maximum  is 100 scans.  This limit is imposed due to a weakness in the
                    JPEG standard which allows small JPEG files to take many minutes or hours to be read.

               <b>jpeg:max-warnings=&lt;value&gt;</b>

                    Specifies an integer value for how many warnings are allowed for any given error type before
                    being promoted to a hard error.  JPEG files producing excessive warnings indicate a  problem
                    with the file.

               <b>jpeg:optimize-coding={true|false}</b>

                    Selects  if huffman encoding should be used. Huffman encoding is enabled by default, but may
                    be disabled for very large images since it  encoding  requires  that  the  entire  image  be
                    buffered  in  memory.  Huffman  encoding produces smaller JPEG files at the expense of added
                    compression time and memory consumption.

               <b>jpeg:preserve-settings</b>

                    If the jpeg:preserve-settings flag is defined, the JPEG encoder will use the same  "quality"
                    and  "sampling-factor"  settings that were found in the input file, if the input was in JPEG
                    format. These settings are also preserved if the input is a JPEG file and the  output  is  a
                    JNG  file.   If  the  colorspace of the output file differs from that of the input file, the
                    quality setting is preserved but the sampling-factors are not.

               <b>pcl:fit-to-page</b>

                    If the pcl:fit-to-page flag is defined, then the printer is requested to scale the image  to
                    fit the page size (width and/or height).
               <b>png:chunk-malloc-max=&lt;value&gt;</b>

                    png:chunk-malloc-max  specifies  the maximum chunk size that libpng will be allowed to read.
                    Libpng's default is normally  8,000,000  bytes.  Very  rarely,  a  valid  PNG  file  may  be
                    encountered  where the error is reported "chunk data is too large".  In this case, the limit
                    may be increased using  this  option.   Take  care  when  increasing  this  limit  since  an
                    excessively large limit could allow untrusted files to use excessive memory.

               <b>mng:maximum-loops=&lt;value&gt;</b>

                    mng:maximum-loops  specifies  the  maximum  number of loops allowed to be specified by a MNG
                    LOOP chunk. Without an imposed limit, a MNG file could request up to 2147483647 loops, which
                    could run for a very long time.  The current default limit is 512 loops.

               <b>pdf:use-cropbox={true|false}</b>

                    If the pdf:use-cropbox flag is set to <b>true</b>, then Ghostscript is requested to apply  the  PDF
                    crop box.

               <b>pdf:stop-on-error={true|false}</b>

                    If  the  pdf:stop-on-error  flag  is  set  to  <b>true</b>,  then  Ghostscript is requested to stop
                    processing the PDF when the first error  is  encountered.   Otherwise  it  will  attempt  to
                    process all requested pages.

               <b>ps:imagemask</b>

                    If  the  ps:imagemask  flag is defined, the PS3 and EPS3 coders will create Postscript files
                    that render bilevel images with the Postscript  imagemask  operator  instead  of  the  image
                    operator.

               <b>ptif:minimum-geometry=&lt;geometry&gt;</b>

                    If  the  ptif:minimum-geometry  key  is defined, GraphicsMagick will use it to determine the
                    minimum frame size to output when writing a pyramid TIFF file  (a  TIFF  file  containing  a
                    succession of reduced versions of the first frame). The default minimum geometry is 32x32.

               <b>tiff:alpha={unspecified|associated|unassociated}</b>

                    Specify  the  TIFF  alpha  channel  type  when reading or writing TIFF files, overriding the
                    normal value. The default alpha channel type for new files is  unspecified  alpha.  Existing
                    alpha settings are preserved when converting from one TIFF file to another. When a TIFF file
                    uses  associated  alpha,  the  image pixels are pre-multiplied (i.e. altered) with the alpha
                    channel. Files with "associated" alpha appear as if they were alpha composited  on  a  black
                    background  when  the matte channel is disabled. If the unassociated alpha type is selected,
                    then the alpha channel is saved without altering the pixels. Photoshop recognizes associated
                    alpha as transparency information, if the file is saved with unassociated alpha,  the  alpha
                    information  is loaded as an independent channel.  Note that for many years, ImageMagick and
                    GraphicsMagick marked TIFF files as using associated alpha, without properly pre-multiplying
                    the pixels.

               <b>tiff:fill-order={msb2lsb|lsb2msb}</b>

                    If the tiff:fill-order key is defined, GraphicsMagick will use it to determine the bit  fill
                    order  used  while  writing  TIFF  files. The normal default is "msb2lsb", which matches the
                    native bit order of all modern CPUs. The only exception to this is when Group3 or Group4 FAX
                    compression is requested since FAX machines send data in bit-reversed  order  and  therefore
                    RFC 2301 recommends using reverse order.

               <b>tiff:group-three-options=&lt;value&gt;</b>

                    If the tiff:group-three-options key is defined, GraphicsMagick will use it to set the group3
                    options  tag when writing group3-compressed TIFF.  Please see the TIFF specification for the
                    usage of this tag.  The default value is 4.

               <b>tiff:ignore-tags=&lt;tags&gt;</b>

                    If the tiff:ignore-tags key is defined, then it is used as a list of comma-delimited integer
                    TIFF tag values to ignore while reading the TIFF file.  This is useful in order to  be  able
                    to  read files which which otherwise fail to read due to problems with TIFF tags.  Note that
                    some TIFF tags are required in order to be able to read the image data at all.

               <b>tiff:photometric={minisblack|miniswhite}</b>

                    For grayscale and bilevel images, GraphicsMagick normally chooses the photometric  based  on
                    bit  depth and compression.  If the tiff:photometric key is defined, GraphicsMagick will use
                    it to determine the photometric used while writing grayscale and bilevel  images.   Normally
                    bilevel images are miniswhite and grayscale images are minisblack.

               <b>tiff:report-warnings={false|true}</b>

                    If  the tiff:report-warnings key is defined and set to <b>true</b>, then TIFF warnings are reported
                    as a warning exception rather than as a coder log message.  Such warnings are reported after
                    the image has been read or written.  Most TIFF warnings are benign but  sometimes  they  may
                    help  deduce  problems  with  the  TIFF  file,  or help detect that the TIFF file requires a
                    special application to read successfully due  to  the  use  of  proprietary  or  specialized
                    extensions.

               <b>tiff:sample-format={unsigned|ieeefp}</b>

                    If the tiff:sample-format key is defined, GraphicsMagick will use it to determine the sample
                    format  used  while writing TIFF files. The default is "unsigned". Specify "ieeefp" in order
                    to write floating-point TIFF files with float (32-bit) or double (64-bit)  values.  Use  the
                    tiff:bits-per-sample define to determine the type of floating-point value to use.

               <b>tiff:max-sample-value=&lt;value&gt;</b>

                    If  the  tiff:max-sample-value key is defined, GraphicsMagick will use the assigned value as
                    the maximum floating point value  while  reading  or  writing  IEEE  floating  point  TIFFs.
                    Otherwise the maximum value is 1.0 or the value obtained from the file's SMaxSampleValue tag
                    (if  present).  The  floating  point data is currently not scanned in advance to determine a
                    best maximum sample value so if the range is not 1.0, or  the  SMaxSampleValue  tag  is  not
                    present, it may be necessary to (intelligently) use this parameter to properly read a file.

               <b>tiff:min-sample-value=&lt;value&gt;</b>

                    If  the  tiff:min-sample-value key is defined, GraphicsMagick will use the assigned value as
                    the minimum floating point value  while  reading  or  writing  IEEE  floating  point  TIFFs.
                    Otherwise the minimum value is 0.0 or the value obtained from the file's SMinSampleValue tag
                    (if present).

               <b>tiff:bits-per-sample=&lt;value&gt;</b>

                    If  the  tiff:bits-per-sample  key  is  defined,  GraphicsMagick  will write images with the
                    specified bits per sample, overriding any existing depth value. Value  may  be  any  in  the
                    range  of  1  to  32, or 64 when the default ´unsigned' format is written, or 16/32/24/64 if
                    IEEEFP format is written.  Please  note  that  the  baseline  TIFF  6.0  specification  only
                    requires readers to handle certain powers of two, and the values to be handled depend on the
                    nature of the image (e.g. colormapped, grayscale, RGB, CMYK).

               <b>tiff:samples-per-pixel=&lt;value&gt;</b>

                    If  the  tiff:samples-per-pixel  key  is  defined to a value, the TIFF coder will write TIFF
                    images with the defined samples per pixel, overriding any value stored in  the  image.  This
                    option should not normally be used.

               <b>tiff:rows-per-strip=&lt;value&gt;</b>

                    Allows  the  user to specify the number of rows per TIFF strip.  Rounded up to a multiple of
                    16 when using JPEG compression. Ignored when using tiles.

               <b>tiff:strip-per-page=true</b>

                    Requests that the image is written in a single TIFF strip. This is normally the default when
                    group3 or group4 compression is requested within  reasonable  limits.  Requesting  a  single
                    strip  for  large  images may result in failure due to resource consumption in the writer or
                    reader.

               <b>tiff:tile</b>

                    Enable writing tiled TIFF (rather than stripped) using the default  tile  size.  Tiled  TIFF
                    organizes the image as an array of smaller images (tiles) in order to enable random access.

               <b>tiff:tile-geometry=&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;</b>

                    Specify the tile size to use while writing tiled TIFF. Width and height should be a multiple
                    of  16.  If  the  value is not a multiple of 16, then it will be rounded down. Enables tiled
                    TIFF if it has  not  already  been  enabled.  GraphicsMagick  does  not  use  tiled  storage
                    internally  so tiles need to be converted back and forth from the internal scanline-oriented
                    storage to tile-oriented storage. Testing with typical RGB images shows that  useful  square
                    tile  size  values range from 128x128 to 1024x1024. Large images which require using a disk-
                    based pixel cache benefit from large tile sizes while images which fit in memory  work  well
                    with smaller tile sizes.

               <b>tiff:tile-width=&lt;width&gt;</b>

                    Specify the tile width to use while writing tiled TIFF. The tile height is then defaulted to
                    an appropriate size. Width should be a multiple of 16. If the value is not a multiple of 16,
                    then it will be rounded down.  Enables tiled TIFF if it has not already been enabled.

               <b>tiff:tile-height=&lt;height&gt;</b>

                    Specify the tile height to use while writing tiled TIFF. The tile width is then defaulted to
                    an  appropriate  size.  Height should be a multiple of 16. If the value is not a multiple of
                    16, then it will be rounded down.  Enables tiled TIFF if it has not already been enabled.

               <b>tiff:webp-lossless={TRUE|FALSE}</b>

                    Specify a value of <b>TRUE</b> to enable lossless mode while writing  WebP-compressed  TIFF  files.
                    The  WebP  <b>webp:lossless</b>  option  may  also be used.  The quality factor set by the <b>-quality</b>
                    option may be used to influence the level of effort expended while compressing.

               <b>tiff:zstd-compress-level=&lt;value&gt;</b>

                    Specify the compression level to use while writing Zstd-compressed  TIFF  files.  The  valid
                    range  is  1  to  22. If this define is not specified, then the 'quality' value is used such
                    that the default quality setting of 75 is translated to a compress  level  of  9  such  that
                    ´quality' has a useful range of 10-184 if used for this purpose.

               <b>webp:exact={true|false}</b>

                    Preserve exact RGB values under transparent areas.  Default false.

               <b>webp:lossless={true|false}</b>

                    Enable lossless encoding. Also enables 'exact' mode.

               <b>webp:method={0-6}</b>

                    Quality/speed trade-off.

               <b>webp:image-hint={default,graph,photo,picture}</b>

                    Hint for image type.

               <b>webp:target-size=&lt;integer&gt;</b>

                    Target size in bytes.

               <b>webp:target-psnr=&lt;float&gt;</b>

                    Minimal distortion to try to achieve.

               <b>webp:segments={1-4}</b>

                    Maximum number of segments to use.

               <b>webp:sns-strength={0-100}</b>

                    Spatial Noise Shaping.

               <b>webp:filter-strength={0-100}</b>

                    Filter strength.

               <b>webp:filter-sharpness={0-7}</b>

                    Filter sharpness.

               <b>webp:filter-type={0,1}</b>

                    Filtering  type.  0  = simple, 1 = strong (only used if filter-strength &gt; 0 or autofilter is
                    enabled).

               <b>webp:auto-filter={true|false}</b>

                    Auto adjust filter's strength.

               <b>webp:alpha-compression=&lt;integer&gt;</b>

                    Algorithm for encoding the alpha plane (0 =  none,  1  =  compressed  with  WebP  lossless).
                    Default is 1.

               <b>webp:alpha-filtering=&lt;integer&gt;</b>

                    Predictive filtering method for alpha plane. 0: none, 1: fast, 2: best. Default is 1.

               <b>webp:alpha-quality={0-100}</b>

                    Between 0 (smallest size) and 100 (lossless). Default is 100.

               <b>webp:pass=[1..10]</b>

                    Number of entropy-analysis passes.

               <b>webp:show-compressed={true|false}</b>

                    Export the compressed picture back.  In-loop filtering is not applied.

               <b>webp:preprocessing=[0,1,2]</b>

                    0=none, 1=segment-smooth, 2=pseudo-random dithering

               <b>webp:partitions=[0-3]</b>

                    log2(number of token partitions) in [0..3].  Default is 0 for easier progressive decoding.

               <b>webp:partition-limit={0-100}</b>

                    Quality  degradation  allowed  to  fit  the  512k  limit  on  prediction modes coding (0: no
                    degradation, 100: maximum possible degradation).

               <b>webp:emulate-jpeg-size={true|false}</b>

                    If true, compression parameters will be remapped to better match the  expected  output  size
                    from  JPEG  compression. Generally, the output size will be similar but the degradation will
                    be lower.

               <b>webp:thread-level=&lt;integer&gt;</b>

                    If non-zero, try and use multi-threaded encoding.

               <b>webp:low-memory={true|false}</b>

                    If set, reduce memory usage (but increase CPU use)

               <b>webp:use-sharp-yuv={true|false}</b>

                    If set, if needed, use sharp (and slow) RGB-&gt;YUV conversion

               For example, to create a postscript file that will render only the  black  pixels  of  a  bilevel
               image, use:

                   gm convert bilevel.tif -define ps:imagemask eps3:stencil.ps

       <b>-delay</b> <u>&lt;1/100ths</u> <u>of</u> <u>a</u> <u>second&gt;</u>
              display the next image after pausing

              This  option  is  useful  for  regulating  the animation of image sequences <u>Delay/100</u> seconds must
              expire before the display of the next image. The default is no delay between each showing  of  the
              image sequence. The maximum delay is 65535.

              You can specify a delay range (e.g. <u>-delay</u> <u>10-500</u>) which sets the minimum and maximum delay.

       <b>-density</b> <u>&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;</u>
              horizontal  and  vertical  resolution  in  pixels  of  the  image  This option specifies the image
              resolution to store while encoding a  raster  image  or  the  canvas  resolution  while  rendering
              (reading)  vector  formats  such  as  Postscript,  PDF,  WMF,  and  SVG into a raster image. Image
              resolution provides the unit of measure to apply when rendering to  an  output  device  or  raster
              image.  The  default  unit  of measure is in dots per inch (DPI). The <b>-units</b> option may be used to
              select dots per centimeter instead.
               The default resolution is 72 dots per inch, which is equivalent to one point per pixel (Macintosh
              and Postscript standard). Computer screens are normally 72 or 96  dots  per  inch  while  printers
              typically  support  150,  300,  600,  or  1200  dots per inch. To determine the resolution of your
              display, use a ruler to measure the width of your screen in inches, and divide by  the  number  of
              horizontal  pixels  (1024 on a 1024x768 display).  If the file format supports it, this option may
              be used to update the stored image resolution.  Note  that  Photoshop  stores  and  obtains  image
              resolution  from  a  proprietary embedded profile. If this profile is not stripped from the image,
              then Photoshop will continue to treat the image using its former resolution,  ignoring  the  image
              resolution specified in the standard file header.  The density option is an attribute and does not
              alter  the  underlying  raster  image.  It  may  be  used  to adjust the rendered size for desktop
              publishing purposes by adjusting the scale applied to the pixels. To resize the image so  that  it
              is the same size at a different resolution, use the <b>-resample</b> option.

       <b>-depth</b> <u>&lt;value&gt;</u>
              depth of the image

              This is the number of bits of color to preserve in the image. Any value between 1 and <b>QuantumDepth</b>
              (build  option)  may be specified, although 8 or 16 are the most common values. Use this option to
              specify the depth of raw images whose depth is unknown such as GRAY, RGB, or CMYK,  or  to  change
              the depth of any image after it has been read.

              See  the  -operator  option  for a way (via '-operator All Depth N') to apply a depth limit to the
              pixels immediately rather than setting an image attribute.

       <b>-descend</b>
              obtain image by descending window hierarchy

       <b>-despeckle</b>
              reduce the speckles within an image

       <b>-displace</b> <u>&lt;horizontal</u> <u>scale&gt;x&lt;vertical</u> <u>scale&gt;</u>
              shift image pixels as defined by a displacement map

              With this option, <u>composite</u> <u>image</u> is used as a displacement map.  Black, within  the  displacement
              map, is a maximum positive displacement.  White is a maximum negative displacement and middle gray
              is  neutral.   The  displacement  is  scaled  to  determine  the  pixel  shift.   By  default, the
              displacement applies in both the horizontal and vertical  directions.   However,  if  you  specify
              <u>mask</u>, <u>composite</u> <u>image</u> is the horizontal X displacement and <u>mask</u> the vertical Y displacement.

       <b>-display</b> <u>&lt;host:display[.screen]&gt;</u>
              specifies the X server to contact

              This option is used with convert for obtaining image or font from this X server.  See <u><a href="../man1/X.1.html">X</a>(1)</u>.

       <b>-dispose</b> <u>&lt;method&gt;</u>
              GIF disposal method

              The Disposal Method indicates the way in which the graphic is to be treated after being displayed.

              Here are the valid methods:

                  Undefined       No disposal specified.
                  None            Do not dispose between frames.
                  Background      Overwrite the image area with
                                  the background color.
                  Previous        Overwrite the image area with
                                  what was there prior to rendering
                                  the image.

       <b>-dissolve</b> <u>&lt;percent&gt;</u>
              dissolve an image into another by the given percent

              The  opacity of the composite image is multiplied by the given percent, then it is composited over
              the main image.

       <b>-dither</b>
              apply Floyd/Steinberg error diffusion to the image

              The basic strategy of dithering is  to  trade  intensity  resolution  for  spatial  resolution  by
              averaging  the  intensities  of  several  neighboring  pixels.   Images  which  suffer from severe
              contouring when reducing colors can be improved with this option.

              The <b>-colors</b> or <b>-monochrome</b> option is required for this option to take effect.

              Use <b>+dither</b> to turn off dithering and to render  PostScript  without  text  or  graphic  aliasing.
              Disabling dithering often (but not always) leads to decreased processing time.

       <b>-draw</b> <u>&lt;string&gt;</u>
              annotate an image with one or more graphic primitives

              Use  this option to annotate an image with one or more graphic primitives.  The primitives include
              shapes, text, transformations, and pixel operations.  The shape primitives are

                   point           x,y
                   line            x0,y0 x1,y1
                   rectangle       x0,y0 x1,y1
                   roundRectangle  x0,y0 x1,y1 wc,hc
                   arc             x0,y0 x1,y1 a0,a1
                   ellipse         x0,y0 rx,ry a0,a1
                   circle          x0,y0 x1,y1
                   polyline        x0,y0  ...  xn,yn
                   polygon         x0,y0  ...  xn,yn
                   Bezier          x0,y0  ...  xn,yn
                   path            path specification
                   image           operator x0,y0 w,h filename

              The text primitive is

                   text            x0,y0 string

              The text gravity primitive is

                   gravity         NorthWest, North, NorthEast, West, Center,
                                   East, SouthWest, South, or SouthEast

              The text gravity primitive only affects the placement of text and does not interact with the other
              primitives.  It is equivalent to using the <b>-gravity</b> commandline option, except that it is  limited
              in scope to the <b>-draw</b> option in which it appears.

              The transformation primitives are

                   rotate          degrees
                   translate       dx,dy
                   scale           sx,sy
                   skewX           degrees
                   skewY           degrees

              The pixel operation primitives are

                   color           x0,y0 method
                   matte           x0,y0 method

              The  shape primitives are drawn in the color specified in the preceding <b>-stroke</b> option. Except for
              the <b>line</b> and <b>point</b> primitives, they are filled with the color specified  in  the  preceding  <b>-fill</b>
              option.  For unfilled shapes, use -fill none.

              <b>Point</b> requires a single coordinate.

              <b>Line</b> requires a start and end coordinate.

              <b>Rectangle</b> expects an upper left and lower right coordinate.

              <b>RoundRectangle</b>  has  the  upper  left  and lower right coordinates and the width and height of the
              corners.

              <b>Circle</b> has a center coordinate and a coordinate for the outer edge.

              Use <b>Arc</b> to inscribe an elliptical arc within a rectangle.  Arcs require a start and end  point  as
              well as the degree of rotation (e.g. 130,30 200,100 45,90).

              Use  <b>Ellipse</b>  to  draw  a  partial  ellipse centered at the given point with the x-axis and y-axis
              radius and start and end of arc in degrees (e.g. 100,100 100,150 0,360).

              Finally, <b>polyline</b> and <b>polygon</b>  require  three  or  more  coordinates  to  define  its  boundaries.
              Coordinates are integers separated by an optional comma.  For example, to define a circle centered
              at 100,100 that extends to 150,150 use:

                   -draw 'circle 100,100 150,150'

              <b>Paths</b> (See Paths) represent an outline of an object which is defined in terms of moveto (set a new
              current  point),  lineto  (draw a straight line), curveto (draw a curve using a cubic Bezier), arc
              (elliptical or circular arc) and closepath (close the current shape by drawing a line to the  last
              moveto)  elements.  Compound paths (i.e., a path with subpaths, each consisting of a single moveto
              followed by one or more line or curve operations) are possible to allow  effects  such  as  "donut
              holes" in objects.

              Use  <b>image</b>  to  composite an image with another image. Follow the image keyword with the composite
              operator, image location, image size, and filename:

                   -draw 'image Over 100,100 225,225 image.jpg'

              You can use 0,0 for the image size, which means to use the actual dimensions found  in  the  image
              header.  Otherwise,  it will be scaled to the given dimensions.  See <b>-compose</b> for a description of
              the composite operators.

              Use <b>text</b> to annotate an image with text. Follow the text coordinates with a string. If the  string
              has  embedded  spaces, enclose it in single or double quotes. Optionally you can include the image
              filename, type, width, height, or other image attribute by embedding special format character. See
              <b>-comment</b> for details.

              For example,

                   -draw 'text 100,100 "%m:%f %wx%h"'

              annotates the image with MIFF:bird.miff 512x480 for an image titled
              bird.miff
              and whose width is 512 and height is 480.

              If the first character of <u>string</u> is <u>@</u>, the text is read
              from a file titled by the remaining characters in the string.  Please
              note that if the string comes from an untrusted source that it should
              be sanitized before use (a security risk).

              <b>Rotate</b> rotates subsequent shape primitives and text primitives about
              the origin of the main image. If the <b>-region</b> option precedes the
              <b>-draw</b> option, the origin for transformations is the upper left
              corner of the region.

              <b>Translate</b> translates them.

              <b>Scale</b> scales them.

              <b>SkewX</b> and <b>SkewY</b> skew them with respect to the origin of
              the main image or the region.

              The transformations modify the current affine matrix, which is initialized
              from the initial affine matrix defined by the <b>-affine</b> option.
              Transformations are cumulative within the <b>-draw</b> option.
              The initial affine matrix is not affected; that matrix is only changed by the
              appearance of another <b>-affine</b> option.  If another <b>-draw</b>
              option appears, the current affine matrix is reinitialized from
              the initial affine matrix.

              Use <b>color</b> to change the color of a pixel to the fill color (see
              <b>-fill</b>). Follow the pixel coordinate
              with a method:

                   point
                   replace
                   floodfill
                   filltoborder
                   reset

              Consider the target pixel as that specified by your coordinate.  The  <b>point</b>  method  recolors  the
              target  pixel.  The  <b>replace</b> method recolors any pixel that matches the color of the target pixel.
              <b>Floodfill</b> recolors any pixel that matches the color of the target pixel and is a neighbor, whereas
              <b>filltoborder</b> recolors any neighbor pixel that is not the border color. Finally, <b>reset</b> recolors all
              pixels.

              Use <b>matte</b> to the change the pixel matte value to transparent. Follow the pixel coordinate  with  a
              method  (see the <b>color</b> primitive for a description of methods). The <b>point</b> method changes the matte
              value of the target pixel. The <b>replace</b> method changes the matte value of any  pixel  that  matches
              the  color  of  the  target pixel. <b>Floodfill</b> changes the matte value of any pixel that matches the
              color of the target pixel and is a neighbor, whereas <b>filltoborder</b> changes the matte value  of  any
              neighbor pixel that is not the border color (<b>-bordercolor</b>).  Finally <b>reset</b> changes the matte value
              of all pixels.

              You  can  set  the  primitive color, font, and font bounding box color with <b>-fill</b>, <b>-font</b>, and <b>-box</b>
              respectively. Options are processed in command line order so be sure to use these  options  <u>before</u>
              the <b>-draw</b> option.

       <b>-edge</b> <u>&lt;radius&gt;</u>
              detect edges within an image

       <b>-emboss</b> <u>&lt;radius&gt;</u>
              emboss an image

       <b>-encoding</b> <u>&lt;type&gt;</u>
              specify the text encoding

              Choose  from  <u>AdobeCustom,</u>  <u>AdobeExpert,</u>  <u>AdobeStandard,</u>  <u>AppleRoman,</u> <u>BIG5,</u> <u>GB2312,</u> <u>Latin</u> <u>2,</u> <u>None,</u>
              <u>SJIScode,</u> <u>Symbol,</u> <u>Unicode,</u> <u>Wansung.</u>

       <b>-endian</b> <u>&lt;type&gt;</u>
              specify endianness (MSB, LSB, or Native) of image

              <u>MSB</u> indicates big-endian (e.g. SPARC, Motorola 68K) while <u>LSB</u> indicates little-endian (e.g.  Intel
              'x86,  VAX) byte ordering.  <u>Native</u> indicates to use the normal ordering for the current CPU.  This
              option currently only influences the CMYK, DPX, GRAY, RGB, and TIFF, formats.

              Use <b>+endian</b> to revert to unspecified endianness.

       <b>-enhance</b>
              apply a digital filter to enhance a noisy image

       <b>-equalize</b>
              perform histogram equalization to the image

       <b>-extent</b> <u>&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;{+-}&lt;x&gt;{+-}&lt;y&gt;</u>
              composite image on background color canvas image

              This option composites the image on a new background color  (<b>-background</b>)  canvas  image  of  size
              &lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;. The existing image content is composited at the position specified by geometry x
              and  y offset and/or desired gravity (<b>-gravity</b>) using the current image compose (<b>-compose</b>) method.
              Image content which falls outside the bounds of the new image dimensions is discarded.

              For example, this command creates a thumbnail of an image, and centers it on a red color  backdrop
              image,  offsetting  the  canvas  ten  pixels  to  the left and five pixels up, with respect to the
              thumbnail:

                  gm convert infile.jpg -thumbnail 120x80 -background red -gravity center \
                            -extent 140x100-10-5 outfile.jpg

              This command reduces or expands a JPEG image to fit on an 800x600 display:

                  gm convert -size 800x600 input.jpg \
                            -resize 800x600 -background black \
                            -compose Copy -gravity center \
                            -extent 800x600 \
                            -quality 92 output.jpg

              If the aspect ratio of the input image isn't exactly 4:3, then the image is centered on an 800x600
              black canvas.

       <b>-file</b> <u>&lt;filename&gt;</u>
              write annotated difference image to file

              If <b>-file</b> is specified, then an  annotated  difference  image  is  generated  and  written  to  the
              specified  file.  Pixels  which  differ between the <b>reference</b> and <b>compare</b> images are modified from
              those in the <b>compare</b> image so that the changed  pixels  become  more  obvious.   Some  images  may
              require  use  of  an  alternative  highlight  style (see <b>-highlight-style</b>) or highlight color (see
              <b>-highlight-color</b>) before the changes are obvious.

       <b>-fill</b> <u>&lt;color&gt;</u>
              color to use when filling a graphic primitive
               Numeric colors specifications in GraphicsMagick are similar to RGB and RGBA color values as  used
              by  SVG  and  CSS  Color  Module  Level  3 (https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-3/#numerical). Use "gm
              convert -list color" to list named colors:

                  name                              (named color)
                  #RGB                              (hex numbers, 4 bits each)
                  #RRGGBB                           (8 bits each)
                  #RRRGGGBBB                        (12 bits each)
                  #RRRRGGGGBBBB                     (16 bits each)
                  #RRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGBBBBBBBB         (32 bits each)
                  #RGBA                             (4 bits each)
                  #RRGGBBAA                         (8 bits each)
                  #RRRRRRGGGGGGBBBBBB               (12 bits each)
                  #RRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGBBBBBBBBAAAAAAAA (32 bits each)
                  rgb(r,g,b)                        (r,g,b are decimal numbers, range 0 to QuantumDepth)
                  rgb(r%,g%,b%)                     (r,g,b are decimal numbers, range 0 to 100%)
                  rgba(r,g,b,a)                     (r,g,b,a are decimal numbers, range 0 to QuantumDepth)
                  rgba(r%,g%,b%,a%)                 (r,g,b,a are decimal numbers, range 0 to 100%)

              Enclose the color specification in quotation marks to prevent the  "#"  or  the  parentheses  from
              being interpreted by your shell.

              For example,

                  gm convert -fill blue ...
                  gm convert -fill "#ddddff" ...
                  gm convert -fill "rgb(65000,65000,65535)" ...

              The shorter forms are scaled up, if necessary by replication.  For example,
               #3af, #33aaff, and #3333aaaaffff are all equivalent.

              See <b>-draw</b> for further details.

       <b>-filter</b> <u>&lt;type&gt;</u>
              use this type of filter when resizing an image

              Use  this  option to affect the resizing operation of an image (see <b>-geometry</b>).  Choose from these
              filters (ordered by approximate increasing CPU time):

                   Point
                   Box
                   Triangle
                   Hermite
                   Hanning
                   Hamming
                   Blackman
                   Gaussian
                   Quadratic
                   Cubic
                   Catrom
                   Mitchell
                   Lanczos
                   Bessel
                   Sinc

              The default filter is automatically selected  to  provide  the  best  quality  while  consuming  a
              reasonable amount of time. The <b>Mitchell</b> filter is used if the image supports a palette, supports a
              matte channel, or is being enlarged, otherwise the <b>Lanczos</b> filter is used.

       <b>-flatten</b>
              flatten a sequence of images

              In  some  file  formats  (e.g.  Photoshop's  PSD)  complex  images  may be represented by "layers"
              (independent images) which must be composited  in  order  to  obtain  the  final  rendition.   The
              <b>-flatten</b>  option  accomplishes  this  composition.  The sequence of images is replaced by a single
              image created by compositing each image in turn, while respecting composition operators  and  page
              offsets.   While  <b>-flatten</b>  is  immediately  useful for eliminating layers, it is also useful as a
              general-purpose composition tool.

              The sequence of images is terminated by the appearance of any  option.   If  the  <b>-flatten</b>  option
              appears  after  all  of  the  input  images,  all images are flattened.  Also see <b>-mosaic</b> which is
              similar to <b>-flatten</b> except that it adds a suitably-sized canvas base image.

              For example, this composites an image on top of a 640x400 transparent black canvas image:

                  gm convert -size 640x300 xc:transparent \
                            -compose over -page +0-100 \
                            frame.png -flatten output.png

              and this flattens a Photoshop PSD file:

                  gm convert input.psd -flatten output.png

       <b>-flip</b>  create a "mirror image"

              reflect the scanlines in the vertical direction.

       <b>-flop</b>  create a "mirror image"

              reflect the scanlines in the horizontal direction.

       <b>-font</b> <u>&lt;name&gt;</u>
              use this font when annotating the image with text

              You can tag a font to specify whether it is a PostScript, TrueType, or  X11  font.   For  example,
              Arial.ttf is a TrueType font, ps:helvetica is PostScript, and x:fixed is X11.

       <b>-foreground</b> <u>&lt;color&gt;</u>
              define the foreground color

              The color is specified using the format described under the <b>-fill</b> option.

       <b>-format</b> <u>&lt;type&gt;</u>
              the image format type

              When  used  with  the  <b>mogrify</b> utility, this option will convert any image to the image format you
              specify.  See <u><a href="../man1/GraphicsMagick.1.html">GraphicsMagick</a>(1)</u> for a list of image format types supported by  <b>GraphicsMagick</b>,  or
              see the output of 'gm -list format'.

              By default the file is written to its original name.  However, if the filename extension matches a
              supported  format,  the  extension  is replaced with the image format type specified with <b>-format</b>.
              For example, if you specify <u>tiff</u> as the format type and the input image filename is <u>image.gif</u>, the
              output image filename becomes <u>image.tiff</u>.

       <b>-format</b> <u>&lt;string&gt;</u>
              output formatted image characteristics

              When used with the <b>identify</b> utility, or the <b>convert</b> utility with output written  to  the  'info:-'
              file  specification,  use  this  option  to  print information about the image in a format of your
              choosing.  You can include the image filename, type, width, height,  Exif  data,  or  other  image
              attributes by embedding special format characters:

                   %b   file size
                   %c   comment
                   %d   directory
                   %e   filename extension
                   %f   filename
                   %g   page dimensions and offsets
                   %h   height
                   %i   input filename

                   %H   page height
                   %M   original filename specification
                   %O   page offset (x,y)
                   %P   page dimensions (width,height)
                   %Q   compression quality
                   %T   time delay (in centi-seconds)
                   %U   resolution units
                   %W   page width
                   %X   page horizontal offset (x)
                   %Y   page vertical offset (y)
                   %@   trim bounding box
                   %#   signature
                   \n   newline
                   \r   carriage return
                   %%   %

              For example,

                   -format "%m:%f %wx%h"

              displays <b>MIFF:bird.miff</b> <b>512x480</b> for an image titled <b>bird.miff</b> and whose width is 512 and height is
              480.

              If  the  first  character  of  <u>string</u> is <b>@</b>, the format is read from a file titled by the remaining
              characters in the string.  Please note that if the string comes from an untrusted source  that  it
              should  be  sanitized  before  use  since this may be used to incorporate any readable file on the
              system (a security risk).

              The values of image type (<b>%r</b>) which may be returned include:

                   Bilevel
                   Grayscale
                   GrayscaleMatte
                   Palette

                   ColorSeparationMatte
                   Optimize

              You can also use the following special formatting syntax to print Exif  information  contained  in
              the file:

                   %[EXIF:&lt;tag&gt;]

              Where "&lt;tag&gt;" may be one of the following:

                   *  (print all Exif tags, in keyword=data format)
                   !  (print all Exif tags, in tag_number format)

              JPEG specific information (from reading a JPEG file) may be obtained like this:

                   %[JPEG-&lt;tag&gt;]

              Where "&lt;tag&gt;" may be one of the following:

                   *                 (all JPEG-related tags, in
                                      keyword=data format)
                   Quality           IJG JPEG "quality" estimate
                   Colorspace        JPEG colorspace numeric ID
                   Colorspace-Name   JPEG colorspace name
                   Sampling-factors  JPEG sampling factors

              Please  note  that  JPEG  has  no  notion  of  "quality"  and that the quality metric used by, and
              estimated by the software is based on the quality  metric  established  by  IJG  JPEG  6b.   Other
              encoders (e.g. that used by Adobe Photoshop) use different encoding metrics.

              Surround  the format specification with quotation marks to prevent your shell from misinterpreting
              any spaces and square brackets.

       <b>-frame</b> <u>&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;+&lt;outer</u> <u>bevel</u> <u>width&gt;+&lt;inner</u> <u>bevel</u> <u>width&gt;</u>
              surround the image with an ornamental border

              See <b>-geometry</b> for details about the geometry specification.  The <b>-frame</b> option is not affected  by
              the <b>-gravity</b> option.

              The color of the border is specified with the <b>-mattecolor</b> command line option.

       <b>-frame</b> include the X window frame in the imported image

       <b>-fuzz</b> <u>&lt;distance&gt;{%}</u>
              colors within this Euclidean distance are considered equal

              A  number  of  algorithms  search for a target color. By default the color must be exact. Use this
              option to match colors that are close (in Euclidean distance) to the target color in RGB 3D space.
              For example, if you want to automatically trim the edges of an image with <b>-trim</b> but the image  was
              scanned  and the target background color may differ by a small amount. This option can account for
              these differences.

              The <u>distance</u> can be in absolute intensity units or, by appending  <u>"%"</u>,  as  a  percentage  of  the
              maximum possible intensity (255, 65535, or 4294967295).

       <b>-gamma</b> <u>&lt;value&gt;</u>
              level of gamma correction

              The same color image displayed on two different workstations may look different due to differences
              in  the  display  monitor.  Use  gamma  correction to adjust for this color difference. Reasonable
              values extend from <b>0.8</b> to <b>2.3</b>. Gamma less than 1.0 darkens the image and gamma  greater  than  1.0
              lightens  it. Large adjustments to image gamma may result in the loss of some image information if
              the pixel quantum size is only eight bits (quantum range 0 to 255).

              You can apply separate gamma values to the red, green, and blue channels of the image with a gamma
              value list delimited with slashes (e.g., <b>1.7</b>/<b>2.3</b>/<b>1.2</b>).

              Use <b>+gamma</b> <u>value</u> to set the image gamma level without actually adjusting the  image  pixels.  This
              option  is  useful  if  the  image is of a known gamma but not set as an image attribute (e.g. PNG
              images).

       <b>-gaussian</b> <u>&lt;radius&gt;{x&lt;sigma&gt;}</u>
              blur the image with a Gaussian operator

              Use the given radius and standard deviation (sigma).

       <b>-geometry</b> <u>&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;{+-}&lt;x&gt;{+-}&lt;y&gt;{%}{@}{!}{^}{&lt;}{&gt;}</u>
              Specify dimension, offset, and resize options.

              The <b>-geometry</b> option is used for a number of different purposes, depending on the  utility  it  is
              used with.

              For  the  X11  commands  ('animate', 'display', and 'import'), it specifies the preferred size and
              location of the Image window.  By default, the window size is the image size and the  location  is
              chosen by you (or your window manager) when it is mapped.
               For  the  'import',  'convert',  'mogrify' utility commands it may be used to specify the desired
              size when resizing an image.  In this case, symbols representing resize options may be appended to
              the geometry string to influence how the resize request is treated.

              See later notes corresponding to usage by particular commands.  The following notes apply to  when
              <b>-geometry</b>  is  used to express a resize request, taking into account the current properties of the
              image.

              By default, the width and height are maximum values. That is, the image is expanded or  contracted
              to fit the width and height value while maintaining the aspect ratio of the image.

              Append a ^ to the geometry so that the image aspect ratio is maintained when the image is resized,
              but the resulting width or height are treated as minimum values rather than maximum values.

              Append  a  !  (exclamation  point) to the geometry to force the image size to exactly the size you
              specify. For example, if you specify 640x480! the image width is set to 640 pixels and  height  to
              480.

              If  only  the  width  is  specified,  without the trailing 'x', then height is set to width (e.g.,
              -geometry 100 is the same as -geometry 100x100).  If only the width  is  specified  but  with  the
              trailing  'x',  then width assumes the value and the height is chosen to maintain the aspect ratio
              of the image.  Similarly, if only the height is specified prefixed by 'x' (e.g., -geometry  x256),
              the width is chosen to maintain the aspect ratio.

              To  specify  a  percentage  width or height instead, append %. The image size is multiplied by the
              width and height percentages to obtain the final image dimensions. To  increase  the  size  of  an
              image,  use  a  value  greater than 100 (e.g. 125%). To decrease an image's size, use a percentage
              less than 100.

              Use @ to specify the maximum area in pixels of an image.

              Use &gt; to change the dimensions of the image <u>only</u> if its  width  or  height  exceeds  the  geometry
              specification.  &lt;  resizes  the  image  <u>only</u>  if both of its dimensions are less than the geometry
              specification. For example, if you specify '640x480&gt;' and the image size  is  256x256,  the  image
              size  does  not  change.  However, if the image is 512x512 or 1024x1024, it is resized to 480x480.
              Enclose the geometry specification in quotation marks to prevent the &lt; or &gt; from being interpreted
              by your shell as a file redirection.

              When used with <u>animate</u> and <u>display</u>, offsets are handled in the same manner  as  in  <u><a href="../man1/X.1.html">X</a>(1)</u>  and  the
              <b>-gravity</b> option is not used.  If the <u>x</u> is negative, the offset is measured leftward from the right
              edge  of  the  screen  to  the  right edge of the image being displayed.  Similarly, negative <u>y</u> is
              measured between the bottom edges.  The offsets are not affected by "%"; they are always  measured
              in pixels.

              When used as a <u>composite</u> option, <b>-geometry</b> gives the dimensions of the image and its location with
              respect  to  the  composite  image.   If  the  <b>-gravity</b> option is present with <u>NorthEast,</u> <u>East,</u> or
              <u>SouthEast</u> gravity, the <u>x</u> represents the distance from the right edge of the  image  to  the  right
              edge  of the composite image.  Similarly, if the <b>-gravity</b> option is present with <u>SouthWest,</u> <u>South,</u>
              or <u>SouthEast</u> gravity, <u>y</u> is measured between the bottom edges. Accordingly, a positive offset  will
              never  point in the direction outside of the image.  The offsets are not affected by "%"; they are
              always measured in pixels.  To specify the dimensions of the  composite  image,  use  the  <b>-resize</b>
              option.

              When  used  as  a  <u>convert</u>,  <u>import</u>  or  <u>mogrify</u>  option, <b>-geometry</b> is synonymous with <b>-resize</b> and
              specifies the size of the output image.  The offsets, if present, are ignored.

              When used as a <u>montage</u> option, <b>-geometry</b> specifies the image size and border size for  each  tile;
              default  is  256x256+0+0.   Negative  offsets  (border  dimensions) are meaningless.  The <b>-gravity</b>
              option affects the placement of the image within the tile; the default gravity for this purpose is
              <u>Center</u>.  If the "%" sign appears in the geometry specification, the tile  size  is  the  specified
              percentage  of  the  original  dimensions  of  the  first  tile.  To specify the dimensions of the
              montage, use the <b>-resize</b> option.

       <b>-gravity</b> <u>&lt;type&gt;</u>
              direction primitive  gravitates to when annotating the image.

              Choices are: NorthWest, North, NorthEast, West, Center, East, SouthWest, South, SouthEast.

              The direction you choose specifies where to position the  text  when  annotating  the  image.  For
              example  <u>Center</u>  gravity  forces  the  text to be centered within the image. By default, the image
              gravity is <u>NorthWest</u>.  See <b>-draw</b> for  more  details  about  graphic  primitives.   Only  the  text
              primitive is affected by the <b>-gravity</b> option.

              The  <b>-gravity</b> option is also used in concert with the <b>-geometry</b> option and other options that take
              <b>&lt;geometry&gt;</b> as a parameter, such as the <b>-crop</b>  option.   See  <b>-geometry</b>  for  details  of  how  the
              <b>-gravity</b> option interacts with the <b>&lt;x&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;y&gt;</b> parameters of a geometry specification.

              When used as an option to <u>composite</u>, <b>-gravity</b> gives the direction that the image gravitates within
              the composite.

              When  used as an option to <u>montage</u>, <b>-gravity</b> gives the direction that an image gravitates within a
              tile.  The default gravity is <u>Center</u> for this purpose.

       <b>-green-primary</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;,&lt;y&gt;</u>
              green chromaticity primary point

       <b>-hald-clut</b> <u>&lt;clut&gt;</u>
              apply a Hald CLUT to the image

              A Hald CLUT ("Color Look-Up Table") is a special square color image which contains a look-up table
              for red, green, and blue.  The size of the Hald CLUT image is determined by its order.  The  width
              (and  height)  of  a  Hald  CLUT is the cube of the order.  For example, a Hald CLUT of order 8 is
              512x512 pixels (262,144 colors) and of order 16 is 4096x4096 (16,777,216 colors).  A special  CLUT
              is  the  identity  CLUT which which causes no change to the input image.  In order to use the Hald
              CLUT, one takes an identity CLUT and adjusts its colors in some way.  The modified CLUT  can  then
              be used to transform any number of images in an identical way.

              GraphicsMagick  contains  a  built-in identity CLUT generator via the <b>IDENTITY</b> coder.  For example
              reading from the file name <b>IDENTITY:8</b> returns an identity CLUT of  order  8.   Typical  Hald  CLUT
              identity  images  have  an  order  of  between  8 and 16.  The default order for the <b>IDENTITY</b> CLUT
              generator is 8.  Interpolation is used so it is not usually necessary for CLUT images to  be  very
              large.   The PNG file format is ideal for storing Hald CLUT images because it compresses them very
              well.

       <b>-help</b>  print usage instructions

       <b>-highlight-color</b> <u>&lt;color&gt;</u>
              pixel annotation color

              Specifies the color to use when annotating difference pixels.

       <b>-highlight-style</b> <u>&lt;style&gt;</u>
              pixel annotation style

              Specifies the pixel difference annotation style used to draw attention to changed pixels.  May  be
              one  of  <b>Assign</b>, <b>Threshold</b>, <b>Tint</b>, or <b>XOR</b>; where <b>Assign</b> replaces the pixel with the highlight color
              (see <b>-highlight-color</b>), <b>Threshold</b> replaces the pixel with black or white based on  the  difference
              in intensity, <b>Tint</b> alpha tints the pixel with the highlight color, and <b>XOR</b> does an XOR between the
              pixel and the highlight color.

       <b>-iconGeometry</b> <u>&lt;geometry&gt;</u>
              specify the icon geometry

              Offsets, if present in the geometry specification, are handled in the same manner as the <b>-geometry</b>
              option, using X11 style to handle negative offsets.

       <b>-iconic</b>
              iconic animation

       <b>-immutable</b>
              make image immutable

       <b>-implode</b> <u>&lt;factor&gt;</u>
              implode image pixels about the center

       <b>-intent</b> <u>&lt;type&gt;</u>
              use this type of rendering intent when managing the image color

              Use  this  option to affect the the color management operation of an image (see <b>-profile</b>).  Choose
              from these intents: <b>Absolute,</b> <b>Perceptual,</b> <b>Relative,</b> <b>Saturation</b>.

              The default intent is undefined.

       <b>-interlace</b> <u>&lt;type&gt;</u>
              the type of interlacing scheme

              Choices are: <b>None,</b> <b>Line,</b> <b>Plane,</b> or <b>Partition</b>. The default is <b>None</b>.

              This option is used to specify the type of interlacing scheme for raw image formats such as <b>RGB</b> or
              <b>YUV</b>.  <b>None</b> means do not interlace (RGBRGBRGBRGBRGBRGB...),

              <b>Line</b> uses  scanline  interlacing  (RRR...GGG...BBB...RRR...GGG...BBB...),  and  <b>Plane</b>  uses  plane
              interlacing (RRRRRR...GGGGGG...BBBBBB...).

              <b>Partition</b>  is  like plane except the different planes are saved to individual files (e.g. image.R,
              image.G, and image.B).

              Use <b>Line</b> to create an <b>interlaced</b> <b>PNG</b> or  <b>GIF</b> or <b>progressive</b> <b>JPEG</b> image.

       <b>-label</b> <u>&lt;name&gt;</u>
              assign a label to an image

              Use this option to assign a specific label to the image, when writing  to  an  image  format  that
              supports  labels,  such as TIFF, PNG, MIFF, or PostScript. You can include the the image filename,
              type, width, height, or other image attribute by embedding special format character.  A  label  is
              not  drawn  on  the  image,  but  is embedded in the image datastream via a "Label" tag or similar
              mechanism.  If you want the label to be visible on the image itself, use the  <b>-draw</b>  option.   See
              <b>-comment</b> for details.

              For example,

                   -label "%m:%f %wx%h"

              produces an image label of <b>MIFF:bird.miff</b> <b>512x480</b> for an image titled <b>bird.miff</b> and whose width is
              512 and height is 480.

              If the first character of <u>string</u> is <u>@</u>, the image label is read from a file titled by the remaining
              characters  in  the string.  Please note that if the string comes from an untrusted source that it
              should be sanitized before use since otherwise the content of an arbitrary readable file might  be
              incorporated into the image label (a security risk).

              If the -label option appears multiple times, only the last label is stored.

              In PNG images, the label is stored in a <b>tEXt</b> or <b>zTXt</b> chunk with the keyword "label".

              When  converting  to  <u>PostScript</u>,  use  this  option to specify a header string to print above the
              image. Specify the label font with <b>-font</b>.

              When creating a montage, by default the label associated with  an  image  is  displayed  with  the
              corresponding tile in the montage.  Use the <b>+label</b> option to suppress this behavior.

       <b>-lat</b> <u>&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;{+-}&lt;offset&gt;{%}</u>
              perform local adaptive thresholding

              Perform  local adaptive thresholding using the specified width, height, and offset.  The offset is
              a distance in sample space from the mean, as an absolute integer ranging from  0  to  the  maximum
              sample  value  or as a percentage.  If the percent option is supplied, then the offset is computed
              as a percentage of the quantum range.  It is strongly recommended to use  the  percent  option  so
              that results are not sensitive to pixel quantum depth.

              For example,

                   -colorspace gray -lat "10x10-5%"

              will help clarify a scanned grayscale or color document, producing a bi-level equivalent.

       <b>-level</b> <u>&lt;black_point&gt;{,&lt;gamma&gt;}{,&lt;white_point&gt;}{%}</u>
              adjust the level of image contrast

              Give  one,  two  or  three  values  delimited  with  commas: black-point, gamma, white-point (e.g.
              10,1.0,250 or 2%,0.5,98%). The black and white points range from 0 to MaxRGB or from 0 to 100%; if
              the white point is omitted it is set to MaxRGB-black_point. If a "%" sign is present  anywhere  in
              the string, the black and white points are percentages of MaxRGB. Gamma is an exponent that ranges
              from  0.1  to  10.;  if  it  is omitted, the default of 1.0 (no gamma correction) is assumed. This
              interface works similar to Photoshop's "Image-&gt;Adjustments-&gt;Levels..."  "Input Levels" interface.

       <b>-limit</b> <u>&lt;type&gt;</u> <u>&lt;value&gt;</u>
              Disk, File, Map, Memory, Pixels, Width, Height, Read, Threads, or Write resource limit

              By default, resource limits are estimated based on the available resources and capabilities of the
              system. The resource limits are <b>Disk</b>, maximum total disk space consumed; <b>File</b>, maximum  number  of
              file  descriptors allowed to be open at once; <b>Map</b>, maximum total number of file bytes which may be
              memory mapped; <b>Memory</b>, maximum total number of bytes  of  heap  memory  used  for  image  storage;
              <b>Pixels</b>,  maximum  absolute  image  size  (per  image);  <b>Width</b>, maximum image pixels width; <b>Height</b>,
              maximum image pixels height; <b>Read</b>, maximum number of uncompressed bytes  to  read;  <b>Write</b>  maximum
              number  of  uncompressed  bytes to write; and <b>Threads</b>, the maximum number of worker threads to use
              per OpenMP thread team.

              The <b>Disk</b> and <b>Map</b> resource limits are used to decide if (for  a  given  image)  the  decoded  image
              ("pixel  cache") should be stored in heap memory (RAM), in a memory-mapped disk file, or in a disk
              file accessed via read/write I/O.

              The number of total pixels in one image (<b>Pixels</b>), and/or the width/height (<b>Width</b>/<b>Height</b>),  may  be
              limited  in order to force the reading, or creation of images larger than the limit (in pixels) to
              intentionally fail. The disk limit (<b>Disk</b>) establishes an overall limit since using the disk is the
              means of last resort. When the disk limit has been reached, no more images may be read.

              The amount of uncompressed data read when reading one image file may be limited by the <b>Read</b> limit.
              Reading the image fails when the limit is hit.  This option is useful if the data is read  from  a
              stream  (pipe) or from a compressed file such as a gzipped file.  Some files are very compressible
              and so a small compressed file can decompress to a huge amount of data.  This option also  defends
              against  files  which  produce  seemingly endless loops while decoding by seeking backwards in the
              file.

              The amount of uncompressed data written when writing one image file may be limited  by  the  <b>Write</b>
              limit.  Writing the image fails (similar to disk full) when the limit is hit.  If the output is to
              an ordinary file (rather than pipe) then any truncated output file is removed.  This option may be
              used  to  assure  that  unexpectedly large files are not written.  This option may also be used to
              simulate what will happen if the disk is full.

              The value argument is an absolute value, but may have standard binary  suffix  characters  applied
              ('K',  'M',  'G',  'T', 'P', 'E') to apply a scaling to the value (based on a multiplier of 1024).
              Any additional characters are ignored. For example, '-limit Pixels 10MP' limits the maximum  image
              size  to  10  megapixels  and '-limit memory 32MB -limit map 64MB' limits memory and memory mapped
              files to 32 megabytes and 64 megabytes respectively.

              Resource  limits  may  also  be  set  using  environment  variables.  The  environment   variables
              <b>MAGICK_LIMIT_DISK</b>, <b>MAGICK_LIMIT_FILES</b>, <b>MAGICK_LIMIT_MAP</b>, <b>MAGICK_LIMIT_MEMORY</b>, <b>MAGICK_LIMIT_PIXELS</b>,
              <b>MAGICK_LIMIT_WIDTH</b>,     <b>MAGICK_LIMIT_HEIGHT</b>.      <b>MAGICK_LIMIT_READ</b>,    <b>MAGICK_LIMIT_WRITE</b>,    and
              <b>OMP_NUM_THREADS</b> may be used to set the limits for disk space, open files, memory mapped size, heap
              memory, per-image pixels, image width, image height, bytes read from a file, bytes  written  to  a
              file, and OpenMP threads respectively.

              Use the option -list resource list the current limits.

       <b>-linewidth</b>
              the line width for subsequent draw operations

       <b>-list</b> <u>&lt;type&gt;</u>
              the type of list

              Choices  are: <b>Color</b>, <b>Delegate</b>, <b>Format</b>, <b>Magic</b>, <b>Module</b>, <b>Resource</b>, or <b>Type</b>. The <b>Module</b> option is only
              available if GraphicsMagick was built to support loadable modules.

              This option lists information about the GraphicsMagick configuration.

       <b>-log</b> <u>&lt;string&gt;</u>
              Specify format for debug log

              This option specifies the format for the log printed when the <b>-debug</b> option is active.

              You can display the following components by embedding special format characters:

                   %d   domain
                   %e   event
                   %f   function
                   %l   line
                   %m   module
                   %p   process ID
                   %r   real CPU time
                   %t   wall clock time
                   %u   user CPU time
                   %%   percent sign
                   \n   newline
                   \r   carriage return

              For example:

                  gm convert -debug coders -log "%u %m:%l %e" in.gif out.png

              The default behavior is to print all of the components.

       <b>-loop</b> <u>&lt;iterations&gt;</u>
              add Netscape loop extension to your GIF animation

              A value other than zero forces the animation to repeat itself up to <u>iterations</u> times.

       <b>-magnify</b>
              magnify the image

              The image size is doubled using linear interpolation.

       <b>-magnify</b> <u>&lt;factor&gt;</u>
              magnify the image

              The displayed image is magnified by <b>factor</b>.

       <b>-map</b> <u>&lt;filename&gt;</u>
              choose a particular set of colors from this image

              [<u>convert</u> or <u>mogrify</u>]

              By default, color reduction chooses an optimal set of colors  that  best  represent  the  original
              image.  Alternatively,  you  can  choose  a  particular set of colors from an image file with this
              option.

              Use <b>+map</b> to reduce all images in the image sequence that follows to a single optimal set of colors
              that best represent all the images.  The sequence of images is terminated by the appearance of any
              option.  If the <b>+map</b> option appears after all of the input images, all images are mapped.

       <b>-map</b> <u>&lt;type&gt;</u>
              display image using this type.

              [<u>animate</u> or <u>display</u>]

              Choose from these <u>Standard</u> <u>Colormap</u> types:

                   best
                   default
                   gray
                   red
                   green
                   blue

              The <u>X</u> <u>server</u> must support the <u>Standard</u> <u>Colormap</u> you choose, otherwise an error occurs. Use <b>list</b> as
              the type and <b>display</b> searches the list of colormap types  in  <b>top-to-bottom</b>  order  until  one  is
              located. See <u><a href="../man1/xstdcmap.1.html">xstdcmap</a>(1)</u> for one way of creating Standard Colormaps.

       <b>-mask</b> <u>&lt;filename&gt;</u>
              Specify a clipping mask

              The  image read from the file is used as a clipping mask.  It must have the same dimensions as the
              image being masked.

              If the mask image contains an opacity channel, the opacity of each pixel is  used  to  define  the
              mask.   Otherwise,  the intensity (gray level) of each pixel is used.  Unmasked (black) pixels are
              modified while masked pixels (not black) are protected from alteration.

              Use <b>+mask</b> to remove the clipping mask.

              It is not necessary to use <b>-clip</b> to activate the mask; <b>-clip</b> is implied by <b>-mask</b>.

       <b>-matte</b> store matte channel if the image has one

              If the image does not have a matte channel, create an opaque one.

              Use <b>+matte</b> to ignore the matte channel (treats it as opaque) and to avoid writing a matte  channel
              in the output file.

              For  the compare command, <b>-matte</b> will add an opaque matte channel to images if they do not already
              have a matte channel, and matte will be enabled for both images.  Likewise, if <b>+matte</b> is used, the
              matte channel is disabled for both images.  This makes it easier to compare images  regardless  of
              if they already have a matte channel.

       <b>-mattecolor</b> <u>&lt;color&gt;</u>
              specify the color to be used with the <b>-frame</b> option

              The color is specified using the format described under the <b>-fill</b> option.

       <b>-maximum-error</b> <u>&lt;limit&gt;</u>
              specifies the maximum amount of total image error

              Specifies  the  maximum amount of total image error (based on comparison using a specified metric)
              before an error ("image difference exceeds limit") is reported.  The error is reported via a  non-
              zero command execution return status.

       <b>-median</b> <u>&lt;radius&gt;</u>
              apply a median filter to the image

       <b>-metric</b> <u>&lt;metric&gt;</u>
              comparison metric (MAE, MSE, PAE, PSNR, RMSE)

       <b>-minify</b> <u>&lt;factor&gt;</u>
              minify the image

              The image size is halved using linear interpolation.

       <b>-mode</b> <u>&lt;value&gt;</u>
              mode of operation

              The  available  montage  modes  are <b>frame</b> to place the images in a rectangular grid while adding a
              decorative frame with dropshadow, <b>unframe</b> to place undecorated images in a rectangular  grid,  and
              <b>concatenate</b> to pack the images closely together without any well-defined grid or decoration.

       <b>-modulate</b> <u>brightness[,saturation[,hue]]</u>
              vary the brightness, saturation, and hue of an image

              Specify  the  percent change in brightness, color saturation, and hue separated by commas. Default
              argument values are 100 percent, resulting in no  change.  For  example,  to  increase  the  color
              brightness  by  20%  and  decrease  the  color saturation by 10% and leave the hue unchanged, use:
              <b>-modulate</b> <b>120,90</b>.

              Hue is the percentage of absolute rotation from the current position. For example 50 results in  a
              counter-clockwise  rotation of 90 degrees, 150 results in a clockwise rotation of 90 degrees, with
              0 and 200 both resulting in a rotation of 180 degrees.

       <b>-monitor</b>
              show progress indication

              A simple command-line progress indication is shown while  the  command  is  running.  The  process
              indication shows the operation currently being performed and the percent completed. Commands using
              X11  may  replace the command line progress indication with a graphical one once an image has been
              displayed.

       <b>-monochrome</b>
              transform the image to black and white

       <b>-morph</b> <u>&lt;frames&gt;</u>
              morphs an image sequence

              Both the image pixels and size are linearly  interpolated  to  give  the  appearance  of  a  meta-
              morphosis from one image to the next.

              The  sequence  of  images  is  terminated  by  the appearance of any option.  If the <b>-morph</b> option
              appears after all of the input images, all images are morphed.

       <b>-mosaic</b>
              create a mosaic from an image or an image sequence

              The <b>-mosaic</b> option provides a flexible way to composite one or  more  images  onto  a  solid-color
              canvas  image.  It  works  similar  to  <b>-flatten</b>  except that a base canvas image is automatically
              created with a suitable size given the image size, page dimensions, and page offsets of images  to
              be  composited.   The  color  of the base canvas image may be set via the <b>-background</b> option.  The
              default canvas color is 'white', but 'black' or 'transparent' may be more  suitable  depending  on
              the composition algorithm requested.

              The  <b>-compose</b>  option may be used to specify the composition algorithm to use when compositing the
              subsequent image on the base canvas.

              The <b>-page</b> option can be used to establish the  dimensions  of  the  mosaic  and  to  position  the
              subsequent image within the mosaic.  If the <b>-page</b> argument does not specify width and height, then
              the canvas dimensions are evaluated based on the image sizes and offsets.

              The  sequence  of  images  is  terminated  by the appearance of any option.  If the <b>-mosaic</b> option
              appears after all of the input images, all images are included in the mosaic.

              The following is an example of composing an image based on red, green, and blue  layers  extracted
              from a sequence of images and pasted on the canvas image at specified offsets:

                  gm convert -background black \
                            -compose CopyRed   -page +0-100 red.png \
                            -compose CopyGreen -page +0+40  green.png \
                            -compose CopyBlue  -page +0+180 blue.png \
                            -mosaic output.png

       <b>-motion-blur</b> <u>&lt;radius&gt;{x&lt;sigma&gt;}{+angle}</u>
              Simulate motion blur

              Simulate  motion  blur  by  convolving  the image with a Gaussian operator of the given radius and
              standard deviation (sigma). For reasonable results, radius should be larger than sigma. If  radius
              is  zero, then a suitable radius is automatically selected based on sigma. The angle specifies the
              angle that the object is coming from (side which is blurred).

       <b>-name</b>  name an image

       <b>-negate</b>
              replace every pixel with its complementary color

              The red, green, and blue intensities of an image are negated.  White becomes black, yellow becomes
              blue, etc.  Use <b>+negate</b> to only negate the grayscale pixels of the image.

       <b>-noise</b> <u>&lt;radius|type&gt;</u>
              add or reduce noise in an image

              The principal function of noise peak elimination filter is to smooth the objects within  an  image
              without losing edge information and without creating undesired structures. The central idea of the
              algorithm  is  to  replace  a pixel with its next neighbor in value within a pixel window, if this
              pixel has been found to be noise. A pixel is defined as noise if and  only  if  this  pixel  is  a
              maximum or minimum within the pixel window.

              Use <b>radius</b> to specify the width of the neighborhood.

              Use  <b>+noise</b>  followed  by  a  noise  type to add noise to an image.  The noise added modulates the
              existing image pixels. Choose from these noise types:

                   Uniform
                   Gaussian
                   Multiplicative
                   Impulse
                   Laplacian
                   Poisson
                   Random (uniform distribution)

       <b>-noop</b>  NOOP (no option)

              The <b>-noop</b> option can be used to terminate a group of images and reset all options to their default
              values, when no other option is desired.

       <b>-normalize</b>
              transform image to span the full range of color values

              This is a contrast enhancement technique based on the image histogram.

              When computing the contrast enhancement values, the histogram edges  are  truncated  so  that  the
              majority of the image pixels are considered in the contrast enhancement, and outliers (e.g. random
              noise  or  minute  details) are ignored.  The default is that 0.1 percent of the histogram entries
              are ignored.  The percentage of the histogram to ignore may be specified by using the <b>-set</b>  option
              with  the  <b>histogram-threshold</b>  parameter similar to <b>-set</b> <b>histogram-threshold</b> <b>0.01</b> to specify 0.01
              percent.   Use  0  percent  to  use  the  entire  histogram,  with  possibly  diminished  contrast
              enhancement.

       <b>-opaque</b> <u>&lt;color&gt;</u>
              change this color to the pen color within the image

              The  color  is specified using the format described under the <b>-fill</b> option.  The color is replaced
              if it is identical to the target color, or close enough to the target  color  in  a  3D  space  as
              defined by the Euclidean distance specified by <b>-fuzz</b>.

              See <b>-fill</b> and <b>-fuzz</b> for more details.

       <b>-operator</b> <u>channel</u> <u>operator</u> <u>rvalue[%]</u>
              apply a mathematical, bitwise, or value operator to an image channel

              Apply  a  low-level  mathematical,  bitwise,  or value operator to a selected image channel or all
              image channels. Operations which result in negative results are  reset  to  zero,  and  operations
              which overflow the available range are reset to the maximum possible value.

              Select  a  channel  from:  <b>Red</b>, <b>Green</b>, <b>Blue</b>, <b>Opacity</b>, <b>Matte</b>, <b>Cyan</b>, <b>Magenta</b>, <b>Yellow</b>, <b>Black</b>, <b>All</b>, or
              <b>Gray</b>. <b>All</b> only modifies the color channels and does not modify the <b>Opacity</b> channel. Except for the
              threshold operators, <b>All</b> operates on each channel independently so that operations are on  a  per-
              channel basis.

              <b>Gray</b>  treats  the  color channels as a grayscale intensity and performs the requested operation on
              the equivalent pixel intensity so the result is a gray image.  Select an operator from  <b>Add</b>,  <b>And</b>,
              <b>Assign</b>,  <b>Depth</b>, <b>Divide</b>, <b>Gamma</b>, <b>Negate</b>, <b>LShift</b>, <b>Log</b>, <b>Max</b>, <b>Min</b>, <b>Multiply</b>, <b>Or</b>, <b>Pow</b>, <b>RShift</b>, <b>Subtract</b>,
              <b>Threshold</b>, <b>Threshold-White</b>, <b>Threshold-White-Negate</b>, <b>Threshold-Black</b>, <b>Threshold-Black-Negate</b>,  <b>Xor</b>,
              <b>Noise-Gaussian</b>, <b>Noise-Impulse</b>, <b>Noise-Laplacian</b>, <b>Noise-Multiplicative</b>, <b>Noise-Poisson</b>, <b>Noise-Random</b>,
              and <b>Noise-Uniform</b>.

              Rvalue  may  be  any floating point or integer value. Normally rvalue will be in the range of 0 to
              MaxRGB, where MaxRGB is the largest quantum value supported  by  the  GraphicsMagick  build  (255,
              65535,  or  4294967295)  but  values outside this range are useful for some arithmetic operations.
              Arguments to logical or bit-wise operations are rounded to a positive integral value prior to use.
              If a percent (<b>%</b>) symbol is appended to the argument, then the argument has a range  of  0  to  100
              percent.

              The following is a description of the operators:

               <b>Add</b>

                    Result is rvalue added to channel value.

               <b>And</b>

                    Result is the logical AND of rvalue with channel value.

               <b>Assign</b>

                    Result is rvalue.

               <b>Depth</b>

                    Result  is  channel value adjusted so that it may be (approximately) stored in the specified
                    number of bits without additional loss.

               <b>Divide</b>

                    Result is channel value divided by rvalue.

               <b>Gamma</b>

                    Result is channel value gamma adjusted by rvalue.

               <b>LShift</b>

                    Result is channel value bitwise left shifted by rvalue bits.

               <b>Log</b>

                    Result is computed as log(value*rvalue+1)/log(rvalue+1).

               <b>Max</b>

                    Result is assigned to rvalue if rvalue is greater than value.

               <b>Min</b>

                    Result is assigned to rvalue if rvalue is less than value.

               <b>Multiply</b>

                    Result is channel value multiplied by rvalue.

               <b>Negate</b>

                    Result is inverse of channel value (like a film negative). An rvalue must be supplied but is
                    currently not used. Inverting the image twice results in the original image.

               <b>Or</b>

                    Result is the logical OR of rvalue with channel value.

               <b>Pow</b>

                    Result is computed as  pow(value,rvalue).  Similar  to  Gamma  except  that  rvalue  is  not
                    inverted.

               <b>RShift</b>

                    Result is channel value bitwise right shifted by rvalue bits.

               <b>Subtract</b>

                    Result is channel value minus rvalue.

               <b>Threshold</b>

                    Result  is maximum (white) if channel value is greater than rvalue, or minimum (black) if it
                    is less than or equal to rvalue. If <b>all</b> channels are specified, then  thresholding  is  done
                    based on computed pixel intensity.

               <b>Threshold-white</b>

                    Result  is maximum (white) if channel value is greater than rvalue and is unchanged if it is
                    less than or equal to rvalue. This can be used to remove  apparent  noise  from  the  bright
                    parts  of  an  image.  If  <b>all</b>  channels  are  specified, then thresholding is done based on
                    computed pixel intensity.

               <b>Threshold-White-Negate</b>

                    Result is set to black if channel value is greater than rvalue and is  unchanged  if  it  is
                    less than or equal to rvalue. If <b>all</b> channels are specified, then thresholding is done based
                    on computed pixel intensity.

               <b>Threshold-black</b>

                    Result  is  minimum (black) if channel value is less than than rvalue and is unchanged if it
                    is greater than or equal to rvalue. This can be used to remove apparent noise from the  dark
                    parts  of  an  image.  If  <b>all</b>  channels  are  specified, then thresholding is done based on
                    computed pixel intensity.

               <b>Threshold-Black-Negate</b>

                    Result is set to white if channel value is less than than rvalue and is unchanged if  it  is
                    greater  than  or  equal to rvalue. If <b>all</b> channels are specified, then thresholding is done
                    based on computed pixel intensity.

               <b>Xor</b>

                    Result is the logical XOR of rvalue with channel value. An interesting property  of  XOR  is
                    that performing the same operation twice results in the original value.

               <b>Noise-Gaussian</b>

                    Result is the current channel value modulated with gaussian noise according to the intensity
                    specified by rvalue.

               <b>Noise-Impulse</b>

                    Result  is the current channel value modulated with impulse noise according to the intensity
                    specified by rvalue.

               <b>Noise-Laplacian</b>

                    Result is the current  channel  value  modulated  with  laplacian  noise  according  to  the
                    intensity specified by rvalue.

               <b>Noise-Multiplicative</b>

                    Result  is  the current channel value modulated with multiplicative gaussian noise according
                    to the intensity specified by rvalue.

               <b>Noise-Poisson</b>

                    Result is the current channel value modulated with poisson noise according to the  intensity
                    specified by rvalue.

               <b>Noise-Random</b>

                    Result  is  the  current  channel  value  modulated with random (uniform distribution) noise
                    according to the intensity specified by rvalue.  The initial noise intensity (rvalue=1.0) is
                    the range of one pixel quantum span.

               <b>Noise-Uniform</b>

                    Result is the channel value with uniform noise applied according to the intensity  specified
                    by rvalue.

               As  an example, the <b>Assign</b> operator assigns a fixed value to a channel. For example, this command
               sets the red channel to the mid-range value:

                   gm convert in.bmp -operator red assign "50%" out.bmp

               The following applies 50% thresholding to the image and returns a gray image:

                   gm convert in.bmp -operator gray threshold "50%" out.bmp

       <b>-ordered-dither</b> <u>&lt;channeltype&gt;</u> <u>&lt;NxN&gt;</u>
              ordered dither the image

              The channel or channels specified in the <b>channeltype</b> argument are  reduced  to  binary,  using  an
              ordered  dither  method.  The  choices for <b>channeltype</b> are <b>All</b>, <b>Intensity</b>, <b>Red</b>, <b>Green</b>, <b>Blue</b>, <b>Cyan</b>,
              <b>Magenta</b>, <b>Yellow</b>, <b>Black</b>, and <b>Opacity</b>

              When <b>channeltype</b> is "All", the color samples are dithered into a gray level  and  then  that  gray
              level  is  stored in the three color channels.  Separately, the opacity channel is dithered into a
              bilevel opacity value which is stored in the opacity channel.

              When <b>channeltype</b> is "Intensity",  only  the  color  samples  are  dithered.  When  <b>channeltype</b>  is
              "opacity"  or  "matte",  only  the opacity channel is dithered. When a color channel is specified,
              only that channel is dithered.

              The choices for N are 2 through 7. The image is divided into NxN pixel tiles.  In each tile,  some
              or  all  pixels  are turned to white depending on their intensity.  For each N, (N**2)+1 levels of
              gray can be represented.  For N == 2, 3, or 4, the pixels are turned to white  in  an  order  that
              maximizes  dispersion  (i.e., reduces granularity), while for N == 5, 6, and 7, they are turned to
              white in an order that creates a roughly circular black blob in  the  middle  of  each  tile.   An
              attractive  "half-tone"  looking  image  can  be  obtained by first rotating the image 45 degrees,
              performing a 5x5 ordered-dither operation, then rotating it back to the original  orientation  and
              cropping  to  the  original  image  dimensions.   If  the  original  image is gamma-encoded, it is
              advisable to convert it to linear intensity first, e.g., with the "-gamma 0.45455" option.

       <b>-output-directory</b> <u>&lt;directory&gt;</u>
              output files to directory

              Use -output-directory to specify a directory under which  to  write  the  output  files.  Normally
              mogrify  overwrites  the  input  files,  but with this option the output files may be written to a
              different directory tree so that the input files are preserved. The algorithm used  preserves  all
              of  the  input  path  specification  in  the  output  path  so  that the user-specified input path
              (including any sub-directory part) is appended to the output path. If  the  input  file  lacks  an
              extension,  then  a  suitable  extension  is  automatically added to the output file.  The user is
              responsible for creating the output directory specified as an argument, but subdirectories will be
              created as needed if the <b>-create-directories</b> option is supplied.  This option may be used to apply
              transformations on files from one directory  and  write  the  transformed  files  to  a  different
              directory.    In  conjunction  with  <b>-create-directories</b>,  this  option  is  designed  to  support
              transforming whole directory trees of files provided that the relative path of the input  file  is
              included as part the list of filenames.

       <b>-orient</b> <u>&lt;orientation&gt;</u>
              Set the image orientation attribute

              Sets the image orientation attribute.  The image orientation attribute is compatible with the TIFF
              orientation tag (and the EXIF orientation tag).  Accepted values are <b>undefined</b>, <b>TopLeft</b>, <b>TopRight</b>,
              <b>BottomRight</b>,  <b>BottomLeft</b>,  <b>LeftTop</b>,  <b>RightTop</b>,  <b>RightBottom</b>,  <b>LeftBottom</b>,  and hyphenated versions
              thereof (e.g. <b>left-bottom</b>).  Please note that GraphicsMagick does not include an EXIF editor so if
              an EXIF profile is written to the output image, the value in the EXIF profile might not match  the
              image.   It  is  possible  for an image file to indicate its orientation in several different ways
              simultaneously.

       <b>-page</b> <u>&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;{+-}&lt;x&gt;{+-}&lt;y&gt;{%}{!}{&lt;}{&gt;}</u>
              size and location of an image canvas

              Use this option to specify the dimensions of the <u>PostScript</u> page in dots per inch or a  TEXT  page
              in pixels. The choices for a PostScript page are:

              For  convenience  you can specify the page size by media (e.g. A4, Ledger, etc.). Otherwise, <b>-page</b>
              behaves much like <b>-geometry</b> (e.g.  -page letter+43+43&gt;).

              This option is also used to place subimages when writing to a  multi-image  format  that  supports
              offsets,  such as GIF89 and MNG.  When used for this purpose the offsets are always  measured from
              the top left corner of the canvas and are not affected by the <b>-gravity</b> option.  To position a  GIF
              or  MNG image, use <b>-page</b><u>{+-}&lt;x&gt;{+-}&lt;y&gt;</u> (e.g. -page +100+200).  When writing to a MNG file, a <b>-page</b>
              option appearing ahead of the first image in the sequence with nonzero width  and  height  defines
              the  width  and  height  values  that are written in the <b>MHDR</b> chunk.  Otherwise, the MNG width and
              height are computed from the bounding box that contains all images in the sequence.  When  writing
              a GIF89 file, only the bounding box method is used to determine its dimensions.

              For  a  PostScript  page,  the image is sized as in <b>-geometry</b> and positioned relative to the lower
              left hand corner of the page by {+-}&lt;<b>x</b><u>offset</u>&gt;{+-}&lt;<b>y</b> <u>offset&gt;</u>. Use -page 612x792&gt;, for  example,  to
              center  the image within the page. If the image size exceeds the PostScript page, it is reduced to
              fit the page.  The default gravity for the <b>-page</b> option is  <u>NorthWest</u>,  i.e.,  positive  <b>x</b>  and  <b>y</b>
              <u>offset</u>  are  measured  rightward  and  downward  from  the top left corner of the page, unless the
              <b>-gravity</b> option is present with a value other than <u>NorthWest</u>.

              The default page dimensions for a TEXT image is 612x792.

              This option is used in concert with <b>-density</b>.

              Use <b>+page</b> to remove the page settings for an image.

       <b>-paint</b> <u>&lt;radius&gt;</u>
              simulate an oil painting

              Each pixel is replaced by the most frequent color  in  a  circular  neighborhood  whose  width  is
              specified with <u>radius</u>.

       <b>-pause</b> <u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u>
              pause between animation loops [animate]

              Pause for the specified number of seconds before repeating the animation.

       <b>-pause</b> <u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u>
              pause between snapshots [import]

              Pause for the specified number of seconds before taking the next snapshot.

       <b>-pen</b> <u>&lt;color&gt;</u>
              (This option has been replaced by the -fill option)

       <b>-ping</b>  efficiently determine image characteristics

              Use  this  option  to  disable  reading the image pixels so that image characteristics such as the
              image dimensions may be obtained very quickly. For identify, use +ping to force reading the  image
              pixels so that the pixel read rate may be included in the displayed information.

       <b>-pointsize</b> <u>&lt;value&gt;</u>
              pointsize of the PostScript, X11, or TrueType font

       <b>-preview</b> <u>&lt;type&gt;</u>
              image preview type

              Use this option to affect the preview operation of an image (e.g.  convert file.png -preview Gamma
              Preview:gamma.png). Choose from these previews:

                   Rotate
                   Shear
                   Roll
                   Hue
                   Saturation

                   OilPaint
                   CharcoalDrawing
                   JPEG

              The default preview is <b>JPEG</b>.

       <b>-process</b> <u>&lt;command&gt;</u>
              process a sequence of images using a process module

              The  command  argument has the form <b>module=arg1,arg2,arg3,...,argN</b> where <b>module</b> is the name of the
              module to invoke (e.g. "Analyze") and arg1,arg2,arg3,...,argN are an arbitrary number of arguments
              to pass to the process module.  The sequence of images is terminated  by  the  appearance  of  any
              option.

              If the <b>-process</b> option appears after all of the input images, all images are processed.

              For example:

                   gm convert logo: -process Analyze= \
                     -format "%[BrightnessMean],%[BrightnessStddev]" info:-
                   51952,23294

       <b>-profile</b> <u>&lt;filename&gt;</u>
              add ICM, IPTC, or generic profile  to image

              -profile filename adds an ICM (ICC color management), IPTC
              (newswire information), or a generic (including Exif) profile to the image

              Use +profile icm, +profile iptc, or
              +profile profile_name to remove the respective profile.
              Multiple profiles may be listed, separated by commas. Profiles may be
              excluded from subsequent listed matches by preceding their name with
              an exclamation point.  For example, +profile '!icm,*' strips
              all profiles except for the ICM profile.  Use identify
              -verbose to find out what profiles are in the image file.  Use
              +profile "*" to remove all profiles.
              Writing the image to a format that does not support profiles will
              of course also cause all profiles to be removed.  The JPEG and PNG
              formats will store any profiles that have been read and not removed.
              In JPEG they are stored in APP1 markers, and in PNG they are stored
              as hex-coded binary in compressed zTXt chunks, except for the iCC
              chunk which is stored in the iCCP chunk.

              To extract a profile, the <b>-profile</b> option is not used.  Instead,
              simply write the file to an image
              format such as <u>APP1,</u> <u>8BIM,</u> <u>ICM,</u> or <u>IPTC</u>.

              For example, to extract the Exif data (which is stored in JPEG files
              in the <u>APP1</u> profile), use

                  gm convert cockatoo.jpg exifdata.app1
              Note  that  GraphicsMagick  does  not attempt to update any profile to reflect changes made to the
              image, e.g., rotation from portrait to landscape orientation, so it is possible that the preserved
              profile may contain invalid data.

       <b>-preserve-timestamp</b>
              preserve the original timestamps of the file

              Use this option to preserve the original modification and access timestamps of the file,  even  if
              it has been modified.

       <b>+progress</b>
              disable progress monitor and busy cursor

              By  default, when an image is displayed, a progress monitor bar is shown in the top left corner of
              an existing image display window, and the current cursor is replaced with an hourglass cursor. Use
              <b>+progress</b> to disable the progress monitor and busy cursor during display  operations.   While  the
              progress  monitor is disabled for all operations, the busy cursor continues to be enabled for non-
              display operations such as image processing. This option is  useful  for  non-interactive  display
              operations, or when a "clean" look is desired.

       <b>-quality</b> <u>&lt;value&gt;</u>
              JPEG/MIFF/PNG/TIFF compression level
               For  the JPEG and MPEG image formats, quality is 0 (lowest image quality and highest compression)
              to 100 (best quality but least effective  compression).  The  default  quality  is  75.   Use  the
              <b>-sampling-factor</b>  option  to specify the factors for chroma downsampling.  To use the same quality
              value as that found by the JPEG decoder, use the -define jpeg:preserve-settings flag.

              For the MIFF image format, and the TIFF format while using ZIP compression, quality/10 is the zlib
              compression level, which is 0 (worst but fastest compression) to 9 (best but slowest). It  has  no
              effect on the image appearance, since the compression is always lossless.

              For  the  JPEG-2000 image format, quality is mapped using a non-linear equation to the compression
              ratio required by the Jasper library. This non-linear equation is intended to loosely  approximate
              the  quality provided by the JPEG v1 format. The default quality value 75 results in a request for
              16:1 compression. The quality value 100 results in a request for non-lossy compression.

              For the MNG and PNG image formats, the quality value sets the zlib compression  level  (quality  /
              10)  and  filter-type (quality % 10). Compression levels range from 0 (fastest compression) to 100
              (best but slowest). For compression level 0, the Huffman-only strategy is used, which  is  fastest
              but not necessarily the worst compression.

              If filter-type is 4 or less, the specified filter-type is used for all scanlines:

                   0: none
                   1: sub
                   2: up
                   3: average
                   4: Paeth

              If filter-type is 5, adaptive filtering is used when quality is greater than 50 and the image does
              not have a color map, otherwise no filtering is used.

              If filter-type is 6, adaptive filtering with <u>minimum-sum-of-absolute-values</u> is used.

              Only  if  the  output  is  MNG,  if  filter-type  is 7, the LOCO color transformation and adaptive
              filtering with <u>minimum-sum-of-absolute-values</u> are used.

              The default is quality is 75, which means nearly the best  compression  with  adaptive  filtering.
              The  quality  setting has no effect on the appearance of PNG and MNG images, since the compression
              is always lossless.

              For further information, see the PNG specification.

              When writing a JNG image with transparency, two quality values are  required,  one  for  the  main
              image  and  one  for the grayscale image that conveys the opacity channel.  These are written as a
              single integer equal to the main image quality plus 1000 times the opacity quality.  For  example,
              if  you want to use quality 75 for the main image and quality 90 to compress the opacity data, use
              -quality 90075.

              For the PNM family of formats (PNM, PGM, and PPM) specify a quality factor of  zero  in  order  to
              obtain  the ASCII variant of the format. Note that -compress <u>none</u> used to be used to trigger ASCII
              output but provided the opposite result of what was expected as compared with other formats.

              For the TIFF format, the JPEG, WebP, Zip, and Zstd compression algorithms are  influenced  by  the
              quality  value.   JPEG and WebP provide lossy compression so higher quality produces a larger file
              with less degradation.  The Zip and Zstd compression algorithms (and WebP in  lossless  mode)  are
              lossless  and  for  these  algorithms a higher ´quality' means to work harder to produce a smaller
              file, but with no difference in image quality.

       <b>-raise</b> <u>&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;</u>
              lighten or darken image edges

              This will create a 3-D effect. See <b>-geometry</b> for details details about the geometry specification.
              Offsets are not used.

              Use <b>-raise</b> to create a raised effect, otherwise use <b>+raise</b>.

       <b>-random-threshold</b> <u>&lt;channeltype&gt;</u> <u>&lt;LOWxHIGH&gt;</u>
              random threshold the image

              The channel or channels specified in the &lt;channeltype&gt; argument are reduced to  binary,  using  an
              random-threshold  method.  The choices for <b>channeltype</b> are <b>All</b>, <b>Intensity</b>, <b>Red</b>, <b>Green</b>, <b>Blue</b>, <b>Cyan</b>,
              <b>Magenta</b>, <b>Yellow</b>, <b>Black</b>, and <b>Opacity</b>

              When <b>channeltype</b> is "All", the color samples are thresholded into a graylevel and then  that  gray
              level is stored in the three color channels. Separately, the opacity channel is thresholded into a
              bilevel  opacity value which is stored in the opacity channel. For each pixel, a new random number
              is used to establish the threshold to be used. The threshold never exceeds the  specified  maximum
              (HIGH) and is never less than the specified minimum (LOW).

              When  <b>channeltype</b>  is  "intensity",  only  the  color samples are thresholded. When <b>channeltype</b> is
              "opacity" or "matte", only the opacity channel is  thresholded.  The  other  named  channels  only
              threshold the associated channel.

       <b>-recolor</b> <u>&lt;matrix&gt;</u>
              apply a color translation matrix to image channels

              A  user  supplied color translation matrix (expressed as a text string) is used to translate/blend
              the image channels based on weightings in a supplied  matrix  which  may  be  of  order  3  (color
              channels  only),  4  (color channels plus opacity), or 5 (color channels plus opacity and offset).
              Values in the columns of the matrix (red, green, blue, opacity) are used as multipliers  with  the
              existing channel values and added together according to the rows of the matrix.  Matrix values are
              floating point and may be negative.  The offset column (column 5) is purely additive and is scaled
              such  that  0.0  to  1.0  represents the maximum quantum range (but values are not limited to this
              range). The math for the color translation matrix is similar to that used by  Adobe  Flash  except
              that  the offset is scaled to 1.0 (divide Flash offset by 255 for use with GraphicsMagick) so that
              the results are independent of quantum depth.

              An <b>identity</b> matrix exists for each matrix order which results in no  change  to  the  image.   The
              translation matrix should be based on an alteration of the identity matrix.

              Identity matrix of order 3

                1 0 0
                0 1 0
                0 0 1

              which  may  be  formatted  into a convenient matrix argument similar to (comma is treated as white
              space):

                -recolor "1 0 0, 0 1 0, 0 0 1"

              Identity matrix of order 4

                1 0 0 0

                0 0 1 0
                0 0 0 1

              Identity matrix of order 5.  The last row is required to exist for the purpose of parsing, but  is
              otherwise not used.

                1 0 0 0 0
                0 1 0 0 0
                0 0 1 0 0
                0 0 0 1 0
                0 0 0 0 1

              As  an  example,  an  image wrongly in BGR channel order may be converted to RGB using this matrix
              (blue-&gt;red, red-&gt;blue):

                0 0 1
                0 1 0
                1 0 0

              and an RGB image using standard Rec.709 primaries may be converted to grayscale using this  matrix
              of standard weighting factors:

                0.2126 0.7152 0.0722
                0.2126 0.7152 0.0722
                0.2126 0.7152 0.0722

              and contrast may be reduced by scaling down by 80% and adding a 10% offset:

                0.8 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.1
                0.0 0.8 0.0 0.0 0.1
                0.0 0.0 0.8 0.0 0.1
                0.0 0.0 0.0 0.8 0.1
                0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0

       <b>-red-primary</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;,&lt;y&gt;</u>
              red chromaticity primary point

       <b>-region</b> <u>&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;{+-}&lt;x&gt;{+-}&lt;y&gt;</u>
              apply options to a portion of the image

              The <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> offsets are treated in the same manner as in <b>-crop</b>.

       <b>-remote</b>
              perform a X11 remote operation

              The  <b>-remote</b>  command  sends a command to a "gm display" or "gm animate" which is already running.
              The only command recognized at this time is the name of an image file to load. This capability  is
              very useful to load new images without needing to restart GraphicsMagick (e.g. for a slide-show or
              to  use  GraphicsMagick  as the display engine for a different GUI). Also see the <b>+progress</b> option
              for a way to disable progress indication for a clean look while loading new images.

       <b>-render</b>
              render vector operations

              Use <b>+render</b> to turn off rendering vector operations. This is useful  when  saving  the  result  to
              vector formats such as MVG or SVG.

       <b>-repage</b>  <u>&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;+xoff+yoff[!]</u>
              Adjust image page offsets

              Adjust  the  current  image page canvas and position based on a relative page specification.  This
              option may be used to change the location of a subframe (e.g.  part  of  an  animation)  prior  to
              composition.   If  the  geometry  specification  is  absolute  (includes  a  '!'), then the offset
              adjustment is absolute and there is no adjustment to page width and  height,  otherwise  the  page
              width  and  height values are also adjusted based on the current image dimensions.  Use <b>+repage</b> to
              set the image page offsets to default.

       <b>-resample</b> <u>&lt;horizontal&gt;x&lt;vertical&gt;</u>
              Resample image to specified horizontal and vertical resolution

              Resize the image so that its rendered size remains the same  as  the  original  at  the  specified
              target resolution. Either the current image resolution units or the previously set with <b>-units</b> are
              used to interpret the argument. For example, if a 300 DPI image renders at 3 inches by 2 inches on
              a  300  DPI  device,  when the image has been resampled to 72 DPI, it will render at 3 inches by 2
              inches on a 72 DPI device.  Note that only a small number of image formats (e.g.  JPEG,  PNG,  and
              TIFF)  are  capable  of  storing  the  image resolution. For formats which do not support an image
              resolution, the original resolution of the image must be specified via  <b>-density</b>  on  the  command
              line prior to specifying the resample resolution.

              Note  that  Photoshop  stores and obtains image resolution from a proprietary embedded profile. If
              this profile exists in the image, then Photoshop will continue to treat the image using its former
              resolution, ignoring the image resolution specified in the standard file header.

              Some image formats (e.g. PNG) require use of metric or english units so even if the original image
              used a particular unit system, if it is saved to a different format prior to resampling,  then  it
              may be necessary to specify the desired resolution units using <b>-units</b> since the original units may
              have  been lost. In other words, do not assume that the resolution units are restored if the image
              has been saved to a file.

       <b>-resize</b> <u>&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;{%}{@}{!}{&lt;}{&gt;}</u>
              resize an image

              This is an alias for the <b>-geometry</b> option and it behaves in the same manner. If the <b>-filter</b> option
              precedes the <b>-resize</b> option, the specified filter is used.

              There are some exceptions:

              When used as a <u>composite</u> option, <b>-resize</b> conveys the preferred size of  the  output  image,  while
              <b>-geometry</b> conveys the size and placement of the <u>composite</u> <u>image</u> within the main image.

              When  used as a <u>montage</u> option, <b>-resize</b> conveys the preferred size of the montage, while <b>-geometry</b>
              conveys information about the tiles.

       <b>-roll</b> <u>{+-}&lt;x&gt;{+-}&lt;y&gt;</u>
              roll an image vertically or horizontally

              See <b>-geometry</b> for details the geometry specification.  The <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> offsets are not affected by the
              <b>-gravity</b> option.

              A negative <u>x</u> offset rolls the image left-to-right. A negative <u>y</u> offset  rolls  the  image  top-to-
              bottom.

       <b>-rotate</b> <u>&lt;degrees&gt;{&lt;}{&gt;}</u>
              rotate the image

              Positive  angles  rotate  the image in a clockwise direction while negative angles rotate counter-
              clockwise.

              Use &gt; to rotate the image only if its width exceeds the height.  &lt; rotates the image <u>only</u>  if  its
              width  is  less  than the height. For example, if you specify -rotate "-90&gt;" and the image size is
              480x640, the image is not rotated.  However, if the  image  is  640x480,  it  is  rotated  by  -90
              degrees.  If you use &gt; or &lt;, enclose it in quotation marks to prevent it from being misinterpreted
              as a file redirection.

              Empty  triangles left over from rotating the image are filled with the color defined as <b>background</b>
              (class <b>backgroundColor</b>).  The color is specified  using  the  format  described  under  the  <b>-fill</b>
              option.

       <b>-sample</b> <u>&lt;geometry&gt;</u>
              scale image using pixel sampling

              See <b>-geometry</b> for details about the geometry specification.  <b>-sample</b> ignores the <b>-filter</b> selection
              if  the  <b>-filter</b>  option is present.  Offsets, if present in the geometry string, are ignored, and
              the <b>-gravity</b> option has no effect.

       <b>-sampling-factor</b> <u>&lt;horizontal_factor&gt;x&lt;vertical_factor&gt;</u>
              chroma subsampling factors

              This option specifies the sampling factors to be used by the DPX, JPEG, MPEG, or YUV encoders  for
              chroma  downsampling. The sampling factor must be specified while reading the raw YUV format since
              it is not preserved in the file header.  Industry-standard  video  subsampling  notation  such  as
              "4:2:2" may also be used to specify the sampling factors. "4:2:2" is equivalent to a specification
              of "2x1"

              The  JPEG decoder obtains the original sampling factors (and quality settings) when a JPEG file is
              read. To re-use the original sampling factors (and quality setting) when JPEG is output,  use  the
              -define jpeg:preserve-settings flag.

       <b>-scale</b> <u>&lt;geometry&gt;</u>
              scale the image.

              See  <b>-geometry</b>  for  details  about  the  geometry  specification.   <b>-scale</b> uses a simpler, faster
              algorithm, and it ignores the <b>-filter</b> selection if the <b>-filter</b> option  is  present.   Offsets,  if
              present in the geometry string, are ignored, and the <b>-gravity</b> option has no effect.

       <b>-scene</b> <u>&lt;value&gt;</u>
              set scene number

              This option sets the scene number of an image or the first image in an image sequence.

       <b>-scenes</b> <u>&lt;value-value&gt;</u>
              range of image scene numbers to read

              Each  image  in the range is read with the filename followed by a period (<b>.</b>) and the decimal scene
              number.  You can change this behavior by embedding a <b>%d,</b> <b>%0Nd,</b> <b>%o,</b> <b>%0No,</b> <b>%x,</b> <b>or</b> <b>%0Nx</b> <b>printf</b> format
              specification in the file name. For example,

                  gm montage -scenes 5-7 image.miff montage.miff

              makes a montage of files image.miff.5, image.miff.6, and image.miff.7, and

                  gm animate -scenes 0-12 image%02d.miff

              animates files image00.miff, image01.miff, through image12.miff.

       <b>-screen</b>
              specify the screen to capture

              This option indicates that the GetImage request used to obtain the image should  be  done  on  the
              root  window, rather than directly on the specified window.  In this way, you can obtain pieces of
              other windows that overlap the specified window, and more importantly, you can  capture  menus  or
              other popups that are independent windows but appear over the specified window.

       <b>-set</b> <u>&lt;attribute&gt;</u> <u>&lt;value&gt;</u>
              set an image attribute

              Set a named image attribute.  The attribute is set on the current (previously specified on command
              line) image.

       <b>+set</b> <u>&lt;attribute&gt;</u>
              unset an image attribute

              Unset a named image attribute.  The attribute is removed from the current (previously specified on
              command line) image.

       <b>-segment</b> <u>&lt;cluster</u> <u>threshold&gt;x&lt;smoothing</u> <u>threshold&gt;</u>
              segment an image

              Segment  an  image  by analyzing the histograms of the color components and identifying units that
              are homogeneous with the fuzzy c-means technique.

              Segmentation is a very useful fast and and approximate color quantization  algorithm  for  scanned
              printed  pages  or  scanned  cartoons.  It  may  also be used as a special effect. Specify <u>cluster</u>
              <u>threshold</u> as the minimum percentage of total pixels in a cluster before it  is  considered  valid.
              For  huge  images  containing small detail, this may need to be a tiny fraction of a percent (e.g.
              0.015) so that important detail is not lost.  <u>Smoothing</u> <u>threshold</u> eliminates noise in  the  second
              derivative  of  the  histogram.  As  the  value  is  increased,  you  can expect a smoother second
              derivative. The default is 1.5. Add the <u>-verbose</u> option to see a dump of cluster statistics  given
              the parameters used. The statistics may be used as a guide to help fine tune the options.

       <b>-shade</b> <u>&lt;azimuth&gt;x&lt;elevation&gt;</u>
              shade the image using a distant light source

              Specify  <u>azimuth</u>  and  <u>elevation</u>  as  the  position  of the light source. Use <b>+shade</b> to return the
              shading results as a grayscale image.

       <b>-shadow</b> <u>&lt;radius&gt;{x&lt;sigma&gt;}</u>
              shadow the montage

       <b>-shared-memory</b>
              use shared memory

              This option specifies whether the utility  should  attempt  to  use  shared  memory  for  pixmaps.
              GraphicsMagick  must be compiled with shared memory support, and the display must support the <u>MIT-</u>
              <u>SHM</u> extension.  Otherwise, this option is ignored.  The default is <b>True</b>.

       <b>-sharpen</b> <u>&lt;radius&gt;{x&lt;sigma&gt;}</u>
              sharpen the image

              Use a Gaussian operator of the given radius and standard deviation (sigma).

       <b>-shave</b> <u>&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;{%}</u>
              shave pixels from the image edges

              Specify the width of the region to be removed from both sides of the image and the height  of  the
              regions to be removed from top and bottom.

       <b>-shear</b> <u>&lt;x</u> <u>degrees&gt;x&lt;y</u> <u>degrees&gt;</u>
              shear the image along the X or Y axis

              Use the specified positive or negative shear angle.

              Shearing  slides  one  edge  of  an  image  along  the X or Y axis, creating a parallelogram. An X
              direction shear slides an edge along the X axis, while a Y direction shear slides  an  edge  along
              the  Y  axis.  The  amount  of the shear is controlled by a shear angle. For X direction shears, <u>x</u>
              <u>degrees</u> is measured relative to the Y axis, and similarly, for Y direction  shears  <u>y</u>  <u>degrees</u>  is
              measured relative to the X axis.

              Empty  triangles left over from shearing the image are filled with the color defined as <b>background</b>
              (class <b>backgroundColor</b>).  The color is specified  using  the  format  described  under  the  <b>-fill</b>
              option.

       <b>-silent</b>
              operate silently

       <b>-size</b> <u>&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;{+offset}</u>
              width and height of the image

              Use this option to specify the width and height of raw images whose dimensions are unknown such as
              <b>GRAY</b>,  <b>RGB</b>,  or <b>CMYK</b>. In addition to width and height, use <b>-size</b> with an offset to skip any header
              information in the image or  tell  the  number  of  colors  in  a  <b>MAP</b>  image  file,  (e.g.  -size
              640x512+256).

              For Photo CD images, choose from these sizes:

                   192x128
                   384x256
                   768x512
                   1536x1024
                   3072x2048

              Finally,  use  this  option  to choose a particular resolution layer of a JBIG or JPEG image (e.g.
              -size 1024x768).

       <b>-snaps</b> <u>&lt;value&gt;</u>
              number of screen snapshots

              Use this option to grab more than one image from the X  server  screen,  to  create  an  animation
              sequence.

       <b>-solarize</b> <u>&lt;factor&gt;</u>
              negate all pixels above the threshold level

              Specify <u>factor</u> as the percent threshold of the intensity (0 - 99.9%).

              This  option produces a <u>solarization</u> effect seen when exposing a photographic film to light during
              the development process.

       <b>-spread</b> <u>&lt;amount&gt;</u>
              displace image pixels by a random amount

              <u>Amount</u> defines the size of the neighborhood around each pixel to choose a candidate pixel to swap.

       <b>-stegano</b> <u>&lt;offset&gt;</u>
              hide watermark within an image

              Use an offset to start the image hiding some number of pixels from the  beginning  of  the  image.
              Note this offset and the image size.  You will need this information to recover the steganographic
              image (e.g. display -size 320x256+35 stegano:image.png).

       <b>-stereo</b>
              composite two images to create a stereo anaglyph

              The  left side of the stereo pair is saved as the red channel of the output image.  The right side
              is saved as the green channel.  Red-green stereo glasses are required to properly view the  stereo
              image.

       <b>-strip</b> remove all profiles and text attributes from the image

              All  embedded profiles and text attributes are stripped from the image.  This is useful for images
              used for the web, or when output files need to be as small as possible

              Be careful not to use this option to remove author, copyright, and license  information  that  you
              are required to retain when redistributing an image.

       <b>-stroke</b> <u>&lt;color&gt;</u>
              color to use when stroking a graphic primitive

              The color is specified using the format described under the <b>-fill</b> option.

              See <b>-draw</b> for further details.

       <b>-strokewidth</b> <u>&lt;value&gt;</u>
              set the stroke width

              See <b>-draw</b> for further details.

       <b>-swirl</b> <u>&lt;degrees&gt;</u>
              swirl image pixels about the center

              <u>Degrees</u> defines the tightness of the swirl.

       <b>-text-font</b> <u>&lt;name&gt;</u>
              font for writing fixed-width text

              Specifies  the  name of the preferred font to use in fixed (typewriter style) formatted text.  The
              default is 14 point <u>Courier</u>.

              You can tag a font to specify whether it is a PostScript, TrueType, or  X11  font.   For  example,
              Courier.ttf is a TrueType font and x:fixed is X11.

       <b>-texture</b> <u>&lt;filename&gt;</u>
              name of texture to tile onto the image background

       <b>-threshold</b> <u>&lt;value&gt;{%}</u>
              threshold the image

              Modify  the image such that any pixel sample with an intensity value greater than the threshold is
              assigned the maximum intensity (white), or otherwise is assigned the minimum intensity (black). If
              a percent prefix is applied, then the threshold is a percentage of the available range.

              To efficiently create a black and white image from a color image, use

                  gm convert -threshold 50% in.png out.png

              The optimum threshold value depends on the nature of the image.  In order to threshold  individual
              channels,  use  the  <b>-operator</b> subcommand with it's <b>Threshold</b>, <b>Threshold-White</b>, or <b>Threshold-Black</b>
              options.

       <b>-thumbnail</b> <u>&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;{%}{@}{!}{&lt;}{&gt;}</u>
              resize an image (quickly)

              The <b>-thumbnail</b> command resizes the image as quickly as possible, with more concern for speed  than
              resulting  image quality.  Regardless, resulting image quality should be acceptable for many uses.
              It is primarily intended to be used to generate smaller versions of the image,  but  may  also  be
              used to enlarge the image.  The <b>-thumbnail</b> <b>geometry</b> argument observes the same syntax and rules as
              it does for <b>-resize</b>.

       <b>-tile</b> <u>&lt;filename&gt;</u>
              tile image when filling a graphic primitive

       <b>-tile</b> <u>&lt;geometry&gt;</u>
              layout of images [<u>montage</u>]

       <b>-title</b> <u>&lt;string&gt;</u>
              assign title to displayed image [<u>animate,</u> <u>display,</u> <u>montage</u>]

              Use  this option to assign a specific title to the image. This is assigned to the image window and
              is typically displayed in the window title bar.  Optionally you can include  the  image  filename,
              type,  width,  height,  Exif data, or other image attribute by embedding special format characters
              described under the <b>-format</b> option.

              For example,

                   -title "%m:%f %wx%h"

              produces an image title of MIFF:bird.miff 512x480 for an image titled bird.miff and whose width is
              512 and height is 480.

       <b>-transform</b>
              transform the image

              This option applies the transformation matrix from a previous <b>-affine</b> option.

                  gm convert -affine 2,2,-2,2,0,0 -transform bird.ppm bird.jpg

       <b>-transparent</b> <u>&lt;color&gt;</u>
              make this color transparent within the image

              The color is specified using the format described under the <b>-fill</b> option.

       <b>-treedepth</b> <u>&lt;value&gt;</u>
              tree depth for the color reduction algorithm

              Normally, this integer value is zero or one. A value of zero or one causes the use of  an  optimal
              tree depth for the color reduction algorithm

              An  optimal  depth  generally  allows the best representation of the source image with the fastest
              computational speed and the least amount of memory.  However, the default depth  is  inappropriate
              for some images. To assure the best representation, try values between 2 and 8 for this parameter.
              Refer to quantize for more details.

              The  <b>-colors</b>  or <b>-monochrome</b> option, or writing to an image format which requires color reduction,
              is required for this option to take effect.

       <b>-trim</b>  trim an image

              This option removes any edges that are exactly the same color as the corner pixels.  Use <b>-fuzz</b>  to
              make <b>-trim</b> remove edges that are nearly the same color as the corner pixels.

       <b>-type</b> <u>&lt;type&gt;</u>
              the image type

              Choose    from:    <b>Bilevel</b>,   <b>Grayscale</b>,   <b>Palette</b>,   <b>PaletteMatte</b>,   <b>TrueColor</b>,   <b>TrueColorMatte</b>,
              <b>ColorSeparation</b>, <b>ColorSeparationMatte</b>, or <b>Optimize</b>.

              Normally, when a format  supports  different  subformats  such  as  bilevel,  grayscale,  palette,
              truecolor,  and  truecolor+alpha, the encoder will try to choose a suitable subformat based on the
              nature of the image. The <b>-type</b> option may be used to tailor the output subformat. By  default  the
              output  subformat  is  based  on readily available image information and is usually similar to the
              input format.

              Specify -type Optimize in order to enable inspecting all pixels (if necessary) in  order  to  find
              the  most  efficient  subformat.  Inspecting  all of the pixels may be slow for very large images,
              particularly if they are stored in a disk cache. If an RGB image contains only gray  pixels,  then
              every  pixel  in  the  image  must  be  inspected  in  order  to decide that the image is actually
              grayscale!

              Sometimes a specific subformat is desired. For example, to force a JPEG image  to  be  written  in
              TrueColor RGB format even though only gray pixels are present, use

                  gm convert bird.pgm -type TrueColor bird.jpg

              Similarly, using -type TrueColorMatte will force the encoder to write an alpha channel even though
              the image is opaque, if the output format supports transparency.

              Some  pseudo-formats  (e.g. the XC format) will respect the requested type if it occurs previously
              on the command line.  For example, to obtain a DirectClass solid color canvas  image  rather  than
              PsuedoClass, use

                  gm convert -size 640x480 -type TrueColor xc:red red.miff

              Likewise,  specify  <b>-type</b>  <b>Bilevel</b>,  <b>Grayscale</b>,  <b>TrueColor</b>,  or  <b>TrueColorMatte</b> prior to reading a
              Postscript (or PDF file) in order to influence the type of image that Ghostcript returns.  Reading
              performance  will be dramatically improved for black/white Postscript if <b>Bilevel</b> is specified, and
              will be considerably faster if <b>Grayscale</b> is specified.

       <b>-update</b> <u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u>
               detect when image file is modified and redisplay.

              Suppose that while you are displaying an image the file  that  is  currently  displayed  is  over-
              written.   <b>display</b>  will  automatically detect that the input file has been changed and update the
              displayed image accordingly.

       <b>-units</b> <u>&lt;type&gt;</u>
              the units of image resolution

              Choose from: <b>Undefined</b>, <b>PixelsPerInch</b>, or <b>PixelsPerCentimeter</b>. This option  is  normally  used  in
              conjunction with the <b>-density</b> option.

       <b>-unsharp</b> <u>&lt;radius&gt;{x&lt;sigma&gt;}{+&lt;amount&gt;}{+&lt;threshold&gt;}</u>
              sharpen the image with an unsharp mask operator

              The  <b>-unsharp</b>  option  sharpens  an  image. The image is convolved with a Gaussian operator of the
              given radius and standard deviation (sigma). For reasonable results, radius should be larger  than
              sigma. Use a radius of 0 to have the method select a suitable radius.

              The parameters are:

               <b>radius</b>

                    The radius of the Gaussian, in pixels, not counting the center pixel (default 0).

               <b>sigma</b>

                    The standard deviation of the Gaussian, in pixels (default 1.0).

               <b>amount</b>

                    The  percentage of the difference between the original and the blur image that is added back
                    into the original (default 1.0).

               <b>threshold</b>

                    The threshold, as a fraction of MaxRGB, needed  to  apply  the  difference  amount  (default
                    0.05).

       <b>-use-pixmap</b>
              use the pixmap

       <b>-verbose</b>
              print detailed information about the image

              This  information  is  printed:  image  scene  number;  image  name;  image  size; the image class
              (<u>DirectClass</u> or <u>PseudoClass</u>); the total number of unique colors; and the number of seconds to read
              and transform the image. If the image is <u>DirectClass</u>, the total number of  unique  colors  is  not
              displayed  unless  <b>-verbose</b>  is  specified  twice  since it may take quite a long time to compute,
              particularly for deep images.  If the image is <u>PseudoClass</u> then its pixels are defined by  indexes
              into  a  colormap. If the image is <u>DirectClass</u> then each pixel includes a complete and independent
              color specification.

              If <b>-colors</b> is also specified, the total unique colors in  the  image  and  color  reduction  error
              values are printed. Refer to quantize for a description of these values.

       <b>-version</b>
              print detailed GraphicsMagick version/build information

              Reports  the  release  version,  maximum  sample-depth,  web-site  URL,  copyright notice, feature
              support, and the options used while building the software.  This is the same output as produced by
              the 'version' sub-command.

       <b>-version</b>
              print compact GNU-style GraphicsMagick version information

              Reports the release version, maximum sample-depth, web-site URL, and copyright notice.

       <b>-view</b> <u>&lt;string&gt;</u>
              FlashPix viewing parameters

       <b>-virtual-pixel</b> <u>&lt;method&gt;</u>
              specify contents of "virtual pixels"

              This option defines "virtual pixels" for use in operations that  can  access  pixels  outside  the
              boundaries of an image.

              Choose from these methods:

               <b>Constant</b>

                    Use the image background color.

               <b>Edge</b>

                    Extend the edge pixel toward infinity (default).

               <b>Mirror</b>

                    Mirror the image.

               <b>Tile</b>

                    Tile the image.

               This option affects operations that use virtual pixels such as <b>-blur</b>, <b>-sharpen</b>, <b>-wave</b>, etc.

       <b>-visual</b> <u>&lt;type&gt;</u>
              animate images using this X visual type

              Choose from these visual classes:

                   StaticGray
                   GrayScale
                   StaticColor
                   PseudoColor
                   TrueColor
                   DirectColor
                   default
                   visual id

              The  X  server  must support the visual you choose, otherwise an error occurs.  If a visual is not
              specified, the visual class that can display the most simultaneous colors on the default screen is
              chosen.

       <b>-watermark</b> <u>&lt;brightness&gt;x&lt;saturation&gt;</u>
              percent brightness and saturation of a watermark

       <b>-wave</b> <u>&lt;amplitude&gt;x&lt;wavelength&gt;</u>
              alter an image along a sine wave

              Specify <u>amplitude</u> and <u>wavelength</u> of the wave.

       <b>-white-point</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;,&lt;y&gt;</u>
              chromaticity white point

       <b>-white-threshold</b> <u>red[,green][,blue][,opacity]</u>
              pixels above the threshold become white

              Use <b>-white-threshold</b> to set pixels with values above the  specified  threshold  to  maximum  value
              (white).  If  only  one  value is supplied, or the red, green, and blue values are identical, then
              intensity thresholding is used. If the color threshold values are not identical then channel-based
              thresholding is used, and color distortion will occur. Specify a negative value (e.g. -1)  if  you
              want  a  channel  to  be  ignored  but  you do want to threshold a channel later in the list. If a
              percent (%) symbol is appended, then the values are treated as a percentage of maximum range.

       <b>-window</b> <u>&lt;id&gt;</u>
              make image the background of a window

              <u>id</u> can be a window id or name.  Specify <b>root</b> to select X's root window as the target window.

              By default the image is tiled onto the background of the target window.   If <b>backdrop</b> or <b>-geometry</b>
              are specified, the image is surrounded by the background color.  Refer to <b>X</b> <b>RESOURCES</b> for details.

              The image will not display on the root window if the image has more unique colors than the  target
              window colormap allows.  Use <b>-colors</b> to reduce the number of colors.

       <b>-window-group</b>
              specify the window group

       <b>-write</b> <u>&lt;filename&gt;</u>
              write an intermediate image [<u>convert,</u> <u>composite</u>]

              The  current  image  is written to the specified filename and then processing continues using that
              image. The following is an example of how several sizes of  an  image  may  be  generated  in  one
              command (repeat as often as needed):

                  gm convert input.jpg -resize 50% -write input50.jpg \
                            -resize 25% input25.jpg

       <b>-write</b> <u>&lt;filename&gt;</u>
              write the image to a file [<u>display</u>]

              If <u>filename</u> already exists, you will be prompted as to whether it should be overwritten.

              By  default,  the  image is written in the format that it was read in as.  To specify a particular
              image format, prefix <u>filename</u> with the image type and a colon  (e.g.,  ps:image)  or  specify  the
              image type as the filename suffix (e.g., image.ps). Specify file as - for standard output. If file
              has  the  extension  <b>.Z</b>  or  <b>.gz</b>, the file size is <b>compressed</b> using compress or <b>gzip</b> respectively.
              Precede the image file name with | to pipe to a system command.

              Use <b>-compress</b> to specify the type of image compression.

              The equivalent X resource  for  this  option  is  <b>writeFilename</b>  (class  <b>WriteFilename</b>).   See  "X
              Resources", below, for details.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>COLUMNS</b>
              Output  screen  width. Used when formatting text for the screen. Many Unix systems keep this shell
              variable up to date, but it may need to be explicitly exported in order for GraphicsMagick to  see
              it.

       <b>DISPLAY</b>
              X11 display ID (host, display number, and screen in the form hostname:display.screen).

       <b>HOME</b>   Location of user's home directory. For security reasons, now only observed by "uninstalled" builds
              of  GraphicsMagick  which  do  not  have  their  location hard-coded or set by an installer.  When
              supported, GraphicsMagick searches for configuration  files  in  $HOME/.magick  if  the  directory
              exists. See <b>MAGICK_CODER_MODULE_PATH</b>, <b>MAGICK_CONFIGURE_PATH</b>, and <b>MAGICK_FILTER_MODULE_PATH</b> if more
              flexibility is needed.

       <b>MAGICK_ACCESS_MONITOR</b>
              When  set  to  <b>TRUE</b>, command line monitor mode (enabled by <b>-monitor</b>) will also show files accessed
              (including temporary files) and any external commands which  are  executed.  This  is  useful  for
              debugging,  but  also  illustrates arguments made available to an access handler registered by the
              <b>MagickSetConfirmAccessHandler()</b> C library function.

       <b>MAGICK_CODER_STABILITY</b>
              The minimum coder stability level before it will  be  used.  The  available  levels  are  <b>PRIMARY</b>,
              <b>STABLE</b>,  <b>UNSTABLE</b>,  and  <b>BROKEN</b>.   The  default  minimum  level  is <b>UNSTABLE</b>, which means that all
              available working coders will be used. The purpose of  this  option  is  to  reduce  the  security
              exposure  (or  apparent  complexity)  due  to  the huge number of formats supported. Coders at the
              <b>PRIMARY</b> level are commonly used formats with very well maintained implementations. Coders  at  the
              <b>STABLE</b>  level  are  reasonably  well  maintained  but  represent  less used formats. Coders at the
              <b>UNSTABLE</b> level either  have  weak  implementations,  the  file  format  itself  is  weak,  or  the
              probability the coder will be needed is vanishingly small. Coders at the <b>BROKEN</b> level are known to
              often not work properly or might not be useful in their current state at all.

       <b>MAGICK_CODER_MODULE_PATH</b>
              Search  path  to  use when searching for image format coder modules.  This path allows the user to
              arbitrarily extend the image formats supported by GraphicsMagick by adding loadable modules to  an
              arbitrary  location  rather  than copying them into the GraphicsMagick installation directory. The
              formatting of the search path is similar to operating system search paths  (i.e.  colon  delimited
              for Unix, and semi-colon delimited for Microsoft Windows). This user specified search path is used
              before trying the default search path.

       <b>MAGICK_CONFIGURE_PATH</b>
              Search  path  to  use when searching for configuration (.mgk) files.  The formatting of the search
              path is similar to operating system search paths (i.e. colon delimited for  Unix,  and  semi-colon
              delimited  for  Microsoft  Windows).  This  user  specified  search path is used before trying the
              default search path.

       <b>MAGICK_DEBUG</b>
              Debug options (see <b>-debug</b> for details).  Setting the configure debug  option  via  an  environment
              variable  (e.g.  <b>MAGICK_DEBUG=configure</b>)  is necessary to see the complete initialization process,
              which includes searching for configuration files.

       <b>MAGICK_FILTER_MODULE_PATH</b>
              Search path to use when searching for filter process modules (invoked  via  <b>-process</b>).  This  path
              allows  the  user  to arbitrarily extend GraphicsMagick's image processing functionality by adding
              loadable modules to an arbitrary  location  rather  than  copying  them  into  the  GraphicsMagick
              installation  directory.  The  formatting of the search path is similar to operating system search
              paths (i.e. colon delimited for Unix, and semi-colon delimited for Microsoft Windows).  This  user
              specified search path is used before trying the default search path.

       <b>MAGICK_GHOSTSCRIPT_PATH</b>
              For  Microsoft Windows, specify the path to the Ghostscript installation rather than searching for
              it via the Windows registry.  This helps in case Ghostscript is not installed via the  Ghostscript
              Windows installer or the user wants more control over the Ghostscript used.

       <b>MAGICK_HOME</b>
              Path  to  top  of  GraphicsMagick installation directory. Only observed by "uninstalled" builds of
              GraphicsMagick which do not have their location hard-coded or set by an installer.

       <b>MAGICK_MMAP_READ</b>
              If <b>MAGICK_MMAP_READ</b> is set to <b>TRUE</b>, GraphicsMagick will attempt to memory-map the input  file  for
              reading.  This  usually substantially improves repeated read performance since the file is already
              in memory after the first time it has been read. However, testing shows that  performance  may  be
              reduced  for  files accessed for the first time since data is accessed via page-faults (upon first
              access) and many operating systems fail to do sequential read-ahead of memory  mapped  files,  and
              particularly if those files are accessed over a network.  If many large input files are read, then
              enabling  this  option  may harm performance by overloading the operating system's VM system as it
              then needs to free unmapped pages and map new ones.

       <b>MAGICK_IO_FSYNC</b>
              If <b>MAGICK_IO_FSYNC</b> is set to <b>TRUE</b>, then GraphicsMagick will request that the output file is  fully
              flushed and synchronized to disk when it is closed. This incurs a performance penalty, but has the
              benefit  that if the power fails or the system crashes, the file should be valid on disk. If image
              files are referenced from a database, then this option helps assure that the files  referenced  by
              the database are valid.

       <b>MAGICK_IOBUF_SIZE</b>
              The  amount of I/O buffering (in bytes) to use when reading and writing encoded files. The default
              is 16384, which is observed to work well for many cases. The best value for a local filesystem  is
              usually  the  the native filesystem block size (e.g. 4096, 8192, or even 131,072 for ZFS) in order
              to minimize the number of physical disk I/O operations.  I/O performance to files accessed over  a
              network  may benefit significantly by tuning this option. Larger values are not necessarily better
              (they may be slower!), and there is rarely any benefit from using values larger  than  32768.  Use
              convert's  <b>-verbose</b>  option  in  order to evaluate read and write rates in pixels per second while
              keeping in mind that the operating system will try to cache files in RAM.

       <b>MAGICK_LIMIT_DISK</b>
              Maximum amount of disk space allowed for use by the pixel cache.

       <b>MAGICK_LIMIT_FILES</b>
              Maximum number of open files.

       <b>MAGICK_LIMIT_MAP</b>
              Maximum size of a memory mapped file allocation.  A memory mapped file consumes  memory  when  the
              file is accessed, although the system may reclaim such memory when needed.

       <b>MAGICK_LIMIT_MEMORY</b>
              Maximum amount of memory to allocate from the heap.

       <b>MAGICK_LIMIT_PIXELS</b>
              Maximum  number  of  total pixels (image rows times image columns) to allow for any image which is
              requested to be created or read.  This is useful to place a limit on how large an  image  may  be.
              If  the  input  image file has image dimensions larger than the pixel limit, then the image memory
              allocation is denied and an error is returned immediately.  This is a per-image limit and does not
              limit the total number of pixels due to multiple image frames/pages (e.g. multi-page  document  or
              an animation).

       <b>MAGICK_LIMIT_READ</b>
              Maximum  number of uncompressed bytes which may be read while decoding an image.  Each read by the
              software from the input file is counted against the total,  even  if  it  has  been  read  before.
              Decoding fails when the limit is reached.  This limit helps defend against highly compressed files
              (e.g.  via gzip), or files which use complex looping structures, or when data is being read from a
              stream (pipe).

       <b>MAGICK_LIMIT_WIDTH</b>
              Maximum pixel width of an image read, or created.

       <b>MAGICK_LIMIT_HEIGHT</b>
              Maximum pixel height of an image read, or created.

       <b>MAGICK_TMPDIR</b>
              Path to directory where GraphicsMagick should write temporary files. The default  is  to  use  the
              system default, or the location set by <b>TMPDIR</b>.

       <b>TMPDIR</b> For  POSIX-compatible  systems (Unix-compatible), the path to the directory where all applications
              should write temporary files.  Overridden by <b>MAGICK_TMPDIR</b> if it is set.

       <b>TMP</b> <u>or</u> <u>TEMP</u>
              For Microsoft Windows, the path to the directory where applications should write temporary  files.
              Overridden by <b>MAGICK_TMPDIR</b> if it is set.

       <b>OMP_NUM_THREADS</b>
              As  per the OpenMP standard, this specifies the number of threads to use in parallel regions. Some
              compilers default the number of threads to use to the number of processor  cores  available  while
              others default to just one thread. See the OpenMP specification for other standard adjustments and
              your compiler's manual for vendor-specific settings.

</pre><h4><b>GM</b> <b>ANIMATE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Animate</b>  displays  a  sequence  of  images  on any workstation display running an X server. <b>animate</b> first
       determines the hardware capabilities of the workstation. If the number of unique colors in  an  image  is
       less  than  or  equal  to  the number the workstation can support, the image is displayed in an X window.
       Otherwise the number of colors in the image is first  reduced  to  match  the  color  resolution  of  the
       workstation before it is displayed.

       This  means  that a continuous-tone 24 bits-per-pixel image can display on a 8 bit pseudo-color device or
       monochrome  device.  In  most  instances  the  reduced  color  image  closely  resembles  the   original.
       Alternatively,  a monochrome or pseudo-color image sequence can display on a continuous-tone 24 bits-per-
       pixel device.

       To help prevent color flashing on X server visuals that have colormaps, <b>animate</b> creates a single colormap
       from the image sequence. This can be rather time consuming. You can speed this operation up  by  reducing
       the  colors  in  the  image before you "animate" them. Use <b>mogrify</b> to color reduce the images to a single
       colormap. See <b><a href="../man1/mogrify.1.html">mogrify</a>(1)</b> for details. Alternatively, you can  use  a  Standard  Colormap;  or  a  static,
       direct,  or  true  color  visual.   You can define a Standard Colormap with <u>xstdcmap</u>. See <b><a href="../man1/xstdcmap.1.html">xstdcmap</a>(1)</b> for
       details. This method is recommended for colormapped X server because it eliminates the need to compute  a
       global colormap.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To animate a set of images of a cockatoo, use:

           gm animate cockatoo.*

       To animate a cockatoo image sequence while using the Standard Colormap <u>best</u>, use:

           xstdcmap -best
           gm animate -map best cockatoo.*

       To animate an image of a cockatoo without a border centered on a backdrop, use:

           gm animate +borderwidth -backdrop cockatoo.*

               <b>foreground</b> <b>(</b><u>class</u> <b>Foreground)</b>

                    Specifies the preferred color to use for text within  the  Image  window.   The  default  is
                    black.
               <b>geometry</b> <b>(</b><u>class</u> <b>geometry)</b>

                    Specifies  the preferred size and position of the image window. It is not necessarily obeyed
                    by all window managers.  Offsets, if present, are handled  in  <u><a href="../man1/X.1.html">X</a>(1)</u>  style.   A  negative  x
                    offset  is  measured  from the right edge of the screen to the right edge of the icon, and a
                    negative y offset is measured from the bottom edge of the screen to the bottom edge  of  the
                    icon.
               <b>iconGeometry</b> <b>(</b><u>class</u> <b>IconGeometry)</b>

                    Specifies  the  preferred  size  and  position of the application when iconified.  It is not
                    necessarily obeyed by all window managers.  Offsets, if present, are  handled  in  the  same
                    manner as in class Geometry.
               <b>iconic</b> <b>(</b><u>class</u> <b>Iconic)</b>

                    This  resource  indicates that you would prefer that the application's windows initially not
                    be visible as if the windows had be immediately iconified by you. Window managers may choose
                    not to honor the application's request.
               <b>matteColor</b> <b>(</b><u>class</u> <b>MatteColor)</b>

                    Specify the color of windows. It is used for the backgrounds of windows, menus, and notices.
                    A 3D effect is achieved by using highlight  and  shadow  colors  derived  from  this  color.
                    Default value: #ddd.
               <b>name</b> <b>(</b><u>class</u> <b>Name)</b>

                    This  resource specifies the name under which resources for the application should be found.
                    This resource  is  useful  in  shell  aliases  to  distinguish  between  invocations  of  an
                    application,  without  resorting  to  creating  links to alter the executable file name. The
                    default is the application name.
               <b>sharedMemory</b> <b>(</b><u>class</u> <b>SharedMemory)</b>

                    This resource specifies whether animate  should  attempt  use  shared  memory  for  pixmaps.
                    ImageMagick  must  be  compiled with shared memory support, and the display must support the
                    MIT-SHM extension. Otherwise, this resource is ignored. The default is True.
               <b>text_font</b> <b>(</b><u>class</u> <b>textFont)</b>

                    Specifies the name of the preferred font to use in fixed (typewriter style) formatted  text.
                    The default is 14 point <u>Courier</u>.
               <b>title</b> <b>(</b><u>class</u> <b>Title)</b>

                    This  resource  specifies  the  title  to  be used for the Image window. This information is
                    sometimes used by a window manager to provide some sort of header  identifying  the  window.
                    The default is the image file name.

</pre><h4><b>GM</b> <b>BATCH</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>batch</b>  executes an arbitrary number of the utility commands (e.g. <b>convert</b>) in the form of a simple linear
       batch script in order to improve execution efficiency, and/or to allow use as  a  subordinate  co-process
       under the control of an arbitrary script or program.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
        To drive <b>'gm</b> <b>batch'</b> using a shell script (or a program written in any language), have the script/program
       send  commands to 'gm batch' via its standard input.  Specify that standard input should be used by using
       <b>'-'</b> as the file name.  The following example converts all files matching '*.jpg'  to  TIFF  format  while
       rotating  each  file  by  90  degrees  and  stripping  all embedded profiles.  The shell script syntax is
       standard Unix shell:

         for file in *.jpg
         do
           outfile=`basename $file .jpg`.tiff
           echo convert -verbose "'$file'" -rotate 90 \
           +profile "'*'" "'$outfile'"
         done | gm batch -echo on -feedback on -

       We can accomplish the same as the previous example by putting all the commands in a text  file  and  then
       specifying the name of the text file as the script to execute:

         for file in *.jpg
         do
           outfile=`basename $file .jpg`.tiff
           echo convert -verbose "'$file'" -rotate 90 \
           +profile "'*'" "'$outfile'"
         done &gt; script.txt
         gm batch -echo on -feedback on script.txt

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options are processed from left to right and must appear before any filename argument.

       <b>-echo</b> <u>on|off</u>
              command echo on or off

              Specify  <b>on</b> to enable echoing commands to standard output as they are read or <b>off</b> to disable.  The
              default is <b>off</b>.

       <b>-escape</b> <u>unix|windows</u>
              Parse using unix or windows syntax

              Commands must be parsed from the input stream and escaping needs to be used to protect  spaces  or
              quoting  characters  in  the input. Specify <b>unix</b> to use unix-style command line parsing or <b>windows</b>
              for Microsoft Windows command shell style parsing. The default  depends  on  if  the  software  is
              compiled  for Microsoft Windows or for a Unix-type system (including Cygwin on Microsoft Windows).
              It is recommended to use unix syntax because it is more powerful and more portable.

       <b>-fail</b> <u>text</u>
              text to print if a command fails

              When feedback is enabled, this specifies the text to print when the command  fails.   The  default
              text is <b>FAIL</b>.

       <b>-feedback</b> <u>on|off</u>
              enable error feedback

              Print  text  (see -pass and -fail options) feedback after each command to indicate the result, the
              default is <b>off</b>.

       <b>-help</b>

              Prints batch command help.

       <b>-pass</b> <u>text</u>
              text to print if a command passes

              When feedback is enabled, this specifies the text to print when the command passes.   The  default
              text is <b>PASS</b>.

       <b>-prompt</b> <u>text</u>
              Prompt text to use for command line

              If  no  filename  argument  was  specified,  a  simple  command prompt appears where you may enter
              GraphicsMagick commands.  The default prompt is <b>GM&gt;</b>.  Use this option  to  change  the  prompt  to
              something else.

       <b>-stop-on-error</b> <u>on|off</u>
              Specify if command processing stops on error

              Normally command processing continues if a command encounters an error.  Specify <b>-stop-on-error</b> <b>on</b>
              to cause processing to quit immediately on error.

</pre><h4><b>GM</b> <b>BENCHMARK</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>benchmark</b>  executes  an  arbitrary  <b>gm</b>  utility  command  (e.g.  <b>convert</b>) for one or more loops, and/or a
       specified execution time, and reports many execution  metrics.   For  builds  using  OpenMP,  a  mode  is
       provided  to  execute  the benchmark with an increasing number of threads and provide a report of speedup
       and multi-thread execution efficiency.  If <b>benchmark</b> is used to execute a command without any  additional
       benchmark options, then the command is run once.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To obtain benchmark information for a single execution of a command:

           gm benchmark convert input.ppm -gaussian 0x1 output.ppm
       To obtain benchmark information from 100 iterations of the command:

           gm benchmark -iterations 100 convert input.ppm \
             -gaussian 0x1 output.ppm
       To  obtain  benchmark  information by iterating the command until a specified amount of time (in seconds)
       has been consumed:

           gm benchmark -duration 30 convert input.ppm \
             -gaussian 0x1 output.ppm
       To obtain a full performance report with an increasing number of  threads  (1-32  threads,  stepping  the
       number of threads by four each time):

           gm benchmark -duration 3 -stepthreads 4 convert \
             input.ppm -gaussian 0x2 output.ppm
       Here is the interpretation of the output:

           <b>threads</b> - number of threads used.
           <b>iter</b> - number of command iterations executed.
           <b>user</b> - total user time consumed.
           <b>total</b> - total elapsed time consumed.
           <b>iter/s</b> - number of command iterations per second.
           <b>iter/cpu</b> - amount of CPU time consumed per iteration.
           <b>speedup</b> - speedup compared with one thread.
           <b>karp-flatt</b> - Karp-Flatt measure of speedup efficiency.

       <u>Please</u> <u>note</u> <u>that</u> <u>the</u> <u>reported</u> <u>"speedup"</u> <u>is</u> <u>based</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>execution</u> <u>time</u> <u>of</u> <u>just</u> <u>one</u> <u>thread.</u>  <u>A</u> <u>preliminary</u>
       <u>warm-up</u>  <u>pass</u>  <u>is</u>  <u>used</u>  <u>before</u>  <u>timing</u>  <u>the</u> <u>first</u> <u>loop</u> <u>in</u> <u>order</u> <u>to</u> <u>ensure</u> <u>that</u> <u>the</u> <u>CPU</u> <u>is</u> <u>brought</u> <u>out</u> <u>of</u>
       <u>power-saving</u> <u>modes</u> <u>and</u> <u>that</u> <u>system</u> <u>caches</u> <u>are</u> <u>warmed</u> <u>up.</u>  <u>Most</u> <u>modern</u> <u>CPUs</u> <u>provide</u> <u>a</u> <u>"turbo"</u>  <u>mode</u>  <u>where</u>
       <u>the</u> <u>CPU</u> <u>clock</u> <u>speed</u> <u>is</u> <u>increased</u> <u>(e.g.</u> <u>by</u> <u>a</u> <u>factor</u> <u>of</u> <u>two)</u> <u>when</u> <u>only</u> <u>one</u> <u>or</u> <u>two</u> <u>cores</u> <u>are</u> <u>active.</u>  <u>If</u> <u>the</u>
       <u>CPU</u>  <u>grows</u> <u>excessively</u> <u>hot</u> <u>(due</u> <u>to</u> <u>insufficient</u> <u>cooling),</u> <u>then</u> <u>it</u> <u>may</u> <u>dial</u> <u>back</u> <u>its</u> <u>clock</u> <u>rates</u> <u>as</u> <u>a</u> <u>form</u>
       <u>of</u> <u>thermal</u> <u>management.</u>  <u>These</u> <u>factors</u> <u>result</u> <u>in</u> <u>an</u> <u>under-reporting</u> <u>of</u> <u>speedup</u> <u>compared</u> <u>to</u> <u>if</u> <u>"turbo"</u> <u>mode</u>
       <u>was</u> <u>disabled</u> <u>and</u> <u>the</u> <u>CPU</u> <u>does</u> <u>not</u> <u>need</u> <u>to</u> <u>worry</u> <u>about</u> <u>thermal</u> <u>management.</u>  <u>The</u> <b>powertop</b> <u>utility</u> <u>available</u>
       <u>under</u> <u>Linux</u> <u>and</u> <u>Solaris</u> <u>provides</u> <u>a</u> <u>way</u> <u>to</u> <u>observe</u> <u>CPU</u> <u>core</u> <u>clock</u> <u>rates</u> <u>while</u> <u>a</u> <u>benchmark</u> <u>is</u> <u>running.</u>

       <b>-stepthreads</b> <u>step</u>
              execute a per-thread benchmark ramp
               Execute a per-thread benchmark ramp, incrementing the number of  threads  at  each  step  by  the
              specified  value.   The  maximum  number  of  threads  is  taken from the standard OMP_NUM_THREADS
              environment variable.

</pre><h4><b>GM</b> <b>COMPARE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>compare</b> compares two similar images using a specified statistical method (see <b>-metric</b>) and/or by  writing

</pre><h4><b>GM</b> <b>COMPOSITE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>composite</b>  composites  (combines)  images to create new images.  <u>base-image</u> is the base image and <u>change-</u>
       <u>image</u> contains the changes.  <u>ouput-image</u> is the result, and normally has the  same  dimensions  as  <u>base-</u>
       <u>image</u>.

       The  optional  <u>mask-image</u> can be used to provide opacity information for <u>change-image</u> when it has none or
       if you want a different mask.  A mask image is typically grayscale and the same size  as  <b>base-image</b>.  If
       <u>mask-image</u>  is  not  grayscale,  it  is  converted to grayscale and the resulting intensities are used as
       opacity information.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To composite an image of a cockatoo with a perch, use:

           gm composite cockatoo.miff perch.ras composite.miff

       To compute the difference between images in a series, use:

           gm composite -compose difference series.2 series.1
                     difference.miff

       To composite an image of a cockatoo with a perch starting at location (100,150), use:

           gm composite -geometry +100+150 cockatoo.miff
                     perch.ras composite.miff

       To tile a logo across your image of a cockatoo, use

           gm convert +shade 30x60 cockatoo.miff mask.miff
           gm composite -compose bumpmap -tile logo.png
                     cockatoo.miff mask.miff composite.miff

       To composite a red, green, and blue color plane into a single composite image, try

           gm composite -compose CopyGreen green.png red.png
                     red-green.png

</pre><h4><b>GM</b> <b>CONJURE</b></h4><pre>
       The Magick scripting language (MSL) will primarily benefit those that want  to  accomplish  custom  image
       processing  tasks but do not wish to program, or those that do not have access to a Perl interpreter or a
       compiler.  The interpreter is called conjure and here is an example script:

           &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
           &lt;image size="400x400" &gt;
             &lt;read filename="image.gif" /&gt;
             &lt;get width="base-width" height="base-height" /&gt;
             &lt;resize geometry="%[dimensions]" /&gt;
             &lt;get width="width" height="height" /&gt;
             &lt;print output=
               "Image sized from %[base-width]x%[base-height]
                to %[width]x%[height].\n" /&gt;
             &lt;write filename="image.png" /&gt;
           &lt;/image&gt;

       invoked with

           gm conjure -dimensions 400x400 incantation.msl

       All operations will closely follow the key/value pairs defined in PerlMagick, unless otherwise noted.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options are processed in command line order. Any option you specify on the command line remains in effect
       until it is explicitly changed by specifying the option again with  a  different  effect,  or  if  it  is
       changed by a statement in the scripting language.

       You  can  define  your  own  keyword/value  pairs  on  the  command  line.   The script can then use this
       information when setting values by including %[keyword] in the string.   For  example,  if  you  included
       "-dimensions   400x400"   on  the  command  line,  as  illustrated  above,  then  any  string  containing
       "%[dimensions]" would have 400x400 substituted.  The "%[string]" can be used  either  an  entire  string,
       such as geometry="%[dimensions]" or as a part of a string such as filename="%[basename].png".

       The  keyword  can  be any string except for the following reserved strings (in any upper, lower, or mixed
       case variant): <b>debug</b>, <b>help</b>, and <b>verbose</b>, whose usage is described below.

       The value can be any string.  If either the keyword or the value contains white space or any symbols that
       have special meanings to your shell such as "#", "|", or "%", enclose the string in  quotation  marks  or
       use "\" to escape the white space and special symbols.

       Keywords and values are case dependent.  "Key", "key", and "KEY" would be three different keywords.

       For a more detailed description of each option, see Options, above.

       <b>-debug</b> <u>&lt;events&gt;</u>
              enable debug printout

       <b>-define</b> <u>&lt;key&gt;{=&lt;value&gt;},...</u>
              add coder/decoder specific options

       <b>-help</b>  print usage instructions

       <b>-log</b> <u>&lt;string&gt;</u>
              Specify format for debug log

       <b>-verbose</b>

       <b>-version</b>

       <b>-version</b>

</pre><h4><b>MAGICK</b> <b>SCRIPTING</b> <b>LANGUAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The Magick Scripting Language (MSL) presently defines the following elements and their attributes:

               <b>&lt;image&gt;</b>

                    background, color, id, size

                    Define  a new image object.  <b>&lt;/image&gt;</b> destroys it. Because of this, if you wish to reference
                    multiple "subimages" (aka pages or layers), you  can  embed  one  <b>image</b>  element  inside  of
                    another. For example:

                        &lt;image&gt;
                        &lt;read filename="input.png" /&gt;
                        &lt;get width="base-width" height="base-height" /&gt;
                        &lt;image height="base-height" width="base-width"&gt;
                        &lt;image /&gt;
                        &lt;write filename="output.mng" /&gt;
                        &lt;/image&gt;

                        &lt;image size="400x400" /&gt;

               <b>&lt;group&gt;</b>

                    Define  a  new  group  of  image objects.  By default, images are only valid for the life of
                    their <b>&lt;image&gt;</b>element.

                        &lt;image&gt;   -- creates the image
                        .....     -- do stuff with it
                        &lt;/image&gt;  -- dispose of the image

                    However, in a group, all images in that group will stay around for the life of the group:

                        &lt;group&gt;                           -- start a group
                            &lt;image&gt;                       -- create an image
                            ....                          -- do stuff
                            &lt;/image&gt;                      -- NOOP
                            &lt;image&gt;                       -- create another image
                            ....                          -- do more stuff
                            &lt;/image&gt;                      -- NOOP
                            &lt;write filename="image.mng" /&gt;  -- output
                        &lt;/group&gt;                          -- dispose of both images

               <b>&lt;read&gt;</b>

                        filename

                    Read a new image from a disk file.

                        &lt;read filename="image.gif" /&gt;

                    To read two images use

                        &lt;read filename="image.gif" /&gt;
                        &lt;read filename="image.png /&gt;

               <b>&lt;write&gt;</b>

                        filename
                    Write the image(s) to disk, either as a single  multiple-image  file  or  multiple  ones  if
                    necessary.

                         &lt;write filename=image.tiff" /&gt;
               <b>&lt;get&gt;</b>

                    Get  any  attribute  recognized  by  PerlMagick's  GetAttribute()  and stores it as an image
                    attribute for later use. Currently only <u>width</u> and <u>height</u> are supported.

                        &lt;get width="base-width" height="base-height" /&gt;
                        &lt;print output="Image size is %[base-width]x%[base-height].\n" /&gt;

               <b>&lt;set&gt;</b>

                    background, bordercolor, clip-mask, colorspace, density, magick, mattecolor,  opacity.   Set
                    an attribute recognized by PerlMagick's GetAttribute().
               <b>&lt;profile&gt;</b>

                        [profilename]

                    Read one or more IPTC, ICC or generic profiles from file and assign to image

                        &lt;profile iptc="profile.iptc" generic="generic.dat" /&gt;

                    To remove a specified profile use "!" as the filename eg

</pre><h4><b>GM</b> <b>CONVERT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Convert</b> converts an input file using one image format to an output file with a differing image format. In
       addition, various types of image processing can be performed on the converted image during the conversion
       process. <b>Convert</b> recognizes the image formats listed in <u><a href="../man1/GraphicsMagick.1.html">GraphicsMagick</a>(1)</u>.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To make a thumbnail of a JPEG image, use:

           gm convert -size 120x120 cockatoo.jpg -resize 120x120
                   +profile "*" thumbnail.jpg

       In  this  example,  '-size  120x120'  gives  a  hint  to  the  JPEG decoder that the image is going to be
       downscaled to 120x120, allowing it  to  run  faster  by  avoiding  returning  full-resolution  images  to
       GraphicsMagick  for  the  subsequent  resizing  operation.   The  ´-resize 120x120' specifies the desired
       dimensions of the output image.  It will be scaled so its largest dimension is 120 pixels.  The ´+profile
       "*"' removes any ICM, EXIF, IPTC, or other profiles that might be present in the input and aren't  needed
       in the thumbnail.

       To convert a <u>MIFF</u> image of a cockatoo to a SUN raster image, use:

           gm convert cockatoo.miff sun:cockatoo.ras

       To convert a multi-page <u>PostScript</u> document to individual FAX pages, use:

           gm convert -monochrome document.ps fax:page

       To convert a TIFF image to a <u>PostScript</u> A4 page with the image in the lower left-hand corner, use:

           gm convert -page A4+0+0 image.tiff document.ps

       To convert a raw Gray image with a 128 byte header to a portable graymap, use:

           gm convert -depth 8 -size 768x512+128 gray:raw
                   image.pgm

       In  this  example, "raw" is the input file.  Its format is "gray" and it has the dimensions and number of
       header bytes specified by the -size option and the sample depth specified  by  the  -depth  option.   The
       output file is "image.pgm".  The suffix ".pgm" specifies its format.

       To convert a Photo CD image to a TIFF image, use:

           gm convert -size 1536x1024 img0009.pcd image.tiff
           gm convert img0009.pcd[4] image.tiff

       To create a visual image directory of all your JPEG images, use:

           gm convert 'vid:*.jpg' directory.miff

       To annotate an image with blue text using font 12x24 at position (100,100), use:

           gm convert -font helvetica -fill blue
                   -draw "text 100,100 Cockatoo"
                   bird.jpg bird.miff

       To tile a 640x480 image with a JPEG texture with bumps use:

           gm convert -size 640x480 tile:bumps.jpg tiled.png

       To surround an icon with an ornamental border to use with <a href="../man1/Mosaic.1.html">Mosaic</a>(1), use:

           gm convert -mattecolor "#697B8F" -frame 6x6 bird.jpg
                   icon.png

       To create a MNG animation from a DNA molecule sequence, use:

           gm convert -delay 20 dna.* dna.mng

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options are processed in command line order. Any option you specify on the command line remains in effect
       for the set of images that follows, until the set is terminated by the appearance of any option or <b>-noop</b>.
       Some  options  only  affect  the  decoding of images and others only the encoding.  The latter can appear
       after the final group of input images.

</pre><h4><b>GM</b> <b>DISPLAY</b></h4><pre>
       Display is a machine architecture independent image processing and display program.  It  can  display  an
       image  on any workstation screen running an X server. <b>Display</b> can read and write <b>many</b> of the more popular
       image formats (e.g. <b>JPEG</b>, <b>TIFF</b>, <b>PNM</b>, <b>Photo</b> <b>CD</b>, etc.).

       With <b>display</b>, you can perform these functions on an image:

                o  load an image from a file
                o  display the next image
                o  display the former image
                o  display a sequence of images as a slide show
                o  write the image to a file
                o  print the image to a <u>PostScript</u> printer
                o  delete the image file
                o  create a Visual Image Directory

           About Display

       Menu items with a indented triangle have a sub-menu. They are represented above as the indented items. To
       access a sub-menu item, move the pointer to the appropriate menu and press button 1 and  drag.  When  you
       find  the  desired  sub-menu item, release the button and the command is executed.  Move the pointer away
       from the sub-menu if you decide not to execute a particular command.

</pre><h4><b>KEYBOARD</b> <b>ACCELERATORS</b></h4><pre>
       Accelerators are one or two key presses that effect a particular command.  The keyboard accelerators that
       <b>display</b> understands is:

           Ctl+O     Press to load an image from a file.
           space     Press to display the next image.

       If the image is a multi-paged document such as a <u>PostScript</u> document, you can skip ahead several pages by
       preceding this command with a number.  For example to display the fourth page beyond  the  current  page,
       press 4space.

           backspace Press to display the former image.

       If  the  image is a multi-paged document such as a <u>PostScript</u> document, you can skip behind several pages
       by preceding this command with a number.  For example to display the fourth page  preceding  the  current
       page, press 4n.

           Ctl-S    Press to save the image to a file.
           Ctl-P    Press to print the image to a
                    <u>PostScript</u> printer.
           Ctl-D    Press to delete an image file.
           Ctl-N    Press to create a blank canvas.
           Ctl-Q    Press to discard all images and exit program.
           Ctl+Z    Press to undo last image transformation.
           Ctl+R    Press to redo last image transformation.
           Ctl-X    Press to cut a region of
                    the image.
           Ctl-C    Press to copy a region of
                    the image.
           Ctl-V    Press to paste a region to
                    the image.
           &lt;        Press to halve the image size.
           .        Press to return to the original image size.
           &gt;        Press to double the image size.
           %        Press to resize the image to a width and height
                    you specify.
           Cmd-A    Press to make any image transformations
                    permanent.
                    By default, any image size transformations are
                    applied to the original image to create the
                    image displayed on the X server.  However, the
                    transformations are not permanent (i.e. the
                    original image does not change size only the
                    X image does). For example, if you press "&gt;"
                    the X image will appear to double in size, but
                    the original image will in fact remain the same
                    size.  To force the original image to double in
                    size, press "&gt;" followed by "Cmd-A".

       <b>confirmExit</b> <u>(class</u> <u>ConfirmExit)</u>
                <b>Display</b>  pops  up a dialog box to confirm exiting the program when exiting the program. Set this
              resource to False to exit without a confirmation.

       <b>displayGamma</b> <u>(class</u> <u>DisplayGamma)</u>
               Specifies the gamma of the X server.  You can apply separate gamma values to the red, green,  and
              blue  channels  of  the  image with a gamma value list delineated with slashes (i.e. 1.7/2.3/1.2).
              The default is 2.2.

       <b>displayWarnings</b> <u>(class</u> <u>DisplayWarnings)</u>
               <b>Display</b> pops up a dialog box whenever a warning message occurs.  Set this resource  to  False  to
              ignore warning messages.

       <b>font</b> <u>(class</u> <u>FontList)</u>
                Specifies  the  name  of  the preferred font to use in normal formatted text.  The default is 14
              point Helvetica.

       <b>font[1-9]</b> <u>(class</u> <u>Font[1-9])</u>
               Specifies the name of the preferred font to use when annotating the image window with  text.  The

       <b>gammaCorrect</b> <u>(class</u> <u>gammaCorrect)</u>
                This resource, if true, will lighten or darken an image of known gamma to match the gamma of the
              display (see resource <b>displayGamma</b>). The default is True.

       <b>geometry</b> <u>(class</u> <u>Geometry)</u>
               Specifies the preferred size and position of the image window. It is not  necessarily  obeyed  by
              all window managers.

              Offsets,  if  present,  are handled in <u><a href="../man1/X.1.html">X</a>(1)</u> style.  A negative x offset is measured from the right
              edge of the screen to the right edge of the icon, and a negative y offset  is  measured  from  the
              bottom edge of the screen to the bottom edge of the icon.

       <b>iconGeometry</b> <u>(class</u> <u>IconGeometry)</u>
                Specifies  the  preferred  size  and  position  of  the  application  when iconified.  It is not
              necessarily obeyed by all window managers.

              Offsets, if present, are handled in the same manner as in class Geometry.

       <b>iconic</b> <u>(class</u> <u>Iconic)</u>
               This resource indicates that you would prefer that the application's  windows  initially  not  be
              visible  as  if the windows had be immediately iconified by you. Window managers may choose not to
              honor the application's request.

       <b>magnify</b> <u>(class</u> <u>Magnify)</u>
               specifies an integral factor by which the image should be enlarged. The default is 3.  This value
              only affects the magnification window which is invoked with button number 3  after  the  image  is
              displayed.

       <b>matteColor</b> <u>(class</u> <u>MatteColor)</u>
               Specify the color of windows. It is used for the backgrounds of windows, menus, and notices. A 3D
              effect  is  achieved  by using highlight and shadow colors derived from this color. Default value:
              #697B8F.

       <b>name</b> <u>(class</u> <u>Name)</u>
               This resource specifies the name under which resources for the application should be found.  This
              resource  is useful in shell aliases to distinguish between invocations of an application, without
              resorting to creating links to alter the executable file name.  The  default  is  the  application
              name.

       <b>pen[1-9]</b> <u>(class</u> <u>Pen[1-9])</u>
                Specifies the color of the preferred font to use when annotating the image window with text. The
              default colors are black, blue, green, cyan, gray, red, magenta, yellow, and white.

       <b>printCommand</b> <u>(class</u> <u>PrintCommand)</u>
               This command is executed whenever Print is issued.  In  general,  it  is  the  command  to  print
              <u>PostScript</u> to your printer. Default value: lp -c -s %i.

       <b>sharedMemory</b> <u>(class</u> <u>SharedMemory)</u>
                This  resource  specifies  whether  display  should  attempt  use  shared  memory  for  pixmaps.
              GraphicsMagick must be compiled with shared memory support, and the display must support the  MIT-
              SHM extension. Otherwise, this resource is ignored. The default is True.

       <b>textFont</b> <u>(class</u> <u>textFont)</u>
                Specifies  the name of the preferred font to use in fixed (typewriter style) formatted text. The
              default is 14 point Courier.

       <b>title</b> <u>(class</u> <u>Title)</u>
               This resource specifies the title to be used for the image window. This information is  sometimes
              used by a window manager to provide a header identifying the window. The default is the image file
              name.

       <b>undoCache</b> <u>(class</u> <u>UndoCache)</u>
                Specifies, in mega-bytes, the amount of memory in the undo edit cache.  Each time you modify the
              image it is saved in the undo edit cache as long as memory is available. You can subsequently <u>undo</u>
              one or more of these transformations. The default is 16 Megabytes.

       <b>usePixmap</b> <u>(class</u> <u>UsePixmap)</u>
               Images are maintained as a XImage by default. Set this resource  to  True  to  utilize  a  server
              Pixmap  instead.  This option is useful if your image exceeds the dimensions of your server screen
              and you intend to pan the image. Panning is much faster with Pixmaps than with a  XImage.  Pixmaps
              are considered a precious resource, use them with discretion.

              To  set  the geometry of the Magnify or Pan or window, use the geometry resource.  For example, to
              set the Pan window geometry to 256x256, use:

                  gm display.pan.geometry: 256x256

</pre><h4><b>IMAGE</b> <b>LOADING</b></h4><pre>

       Choose a composite operation from the <b>Operators</b> sub-menu of the Command widget. How each operator behaves
       is described below. <u>image</u> <u>window</u> is the image currently displayed on your X server and <u>image</u> is the image
       obtained with the File Browser widget.

       <b>over</b>    The result is the union of the two image shapes, with <u>image</u> obscuring <u>image</u> <u>window</u> in the  region
              of overlap.

       <b>in</b>       The  result  is  simply <u>image</u> cut by the shape of <u>image</u> <u>window</u>.  None of the image data of image
              window is in the result.

       <b>out</b>     The resulting image is <u>image</u> with the shape of <u>image</u> <u>window</u> cut out.

       <b>atop</b>    The result is the same shape as <u>image</u> <u>window</u>, with <u>image</u> obscuring <u>image</u> <u>window</u> where  the  image
              shapes  overlap.  Note  this differs from over because the portion of image outside <u>image</u> <u>window</u>'s
              shape does not appear in the result.

       <b>xor</b>     The result is the image data from both <u>image</u> and <u>image</u> <u>window</u> that is outside the overlap region.
              The overlap region is blank.

       <b>plus</b>    The result is just the sum of the image data. Output values are cropped to the maximum value  (no
              overflow). This operation is independent of the matte channels.

       <b>minus</b>    The result of <u>image</u> - <u>image</u> <u>window</u>, with underflow cropped to zero. The matte channel is ignored
              (set to opaque, full coverage).

       <b>add</b>     The result of <u>image</u> + <u>image</u> <u>window</u>, with overflow wrapping around (mod MaxRGB+1).

       <b>subtract</b>
               The result of <u>image</u> - <u>image</u> <u>window</u>, with underflow wrapping around (mod MaxRGB+1).  The  add  and
              subtract operators can be used to perform reversible transformations.

       <b>difference</b>
               The result of abs(<u>image</u> - <u>image</u> <u>window</u>). This is useful for comparing two very similar images.

       <b>multiply</b>
               The result of <u>image</u> * <u>image</u> <u>window</u>. This is useful for the creation of drop-shadows.

       <b>bumpmap</b>
               The result of <u>image</u> <u>window</u> shaded by <u>window</u>.

       <b>replace</b>
              The resulting image is <u>image</u> <u>window</u> replaced with <u>image</u>.  Here the matte information is ignored.

              The  image  compositor  requires  a matte, or alpha channel in the image for some operations. This
              extra channel usually defines a mask which represents a sort of a  cookie-cutter  for  the  image.
              This  is the case when matte is 255 (full coverage) for pixels inside the shape, zero outside, and
              between zero and 255 on the boundary. If image does not have a matte channel,  it  is  initialized
              with  0  for any pixel matching in color to pixel location (0,0), otherwise 255. See Matte Editing
              for a method of defining a matte channel.

              Note that matte information for image window is not retained  for  colormapped  X  server  visuals
              (e.g. <u>StaticColor,</u> <u>StaticColor,</u> <u>GrayScale,</u> <u>PseudoColor</u>).  Correct compositing behavior may require
              a <u>TrueColor</u> or <u>DirectColor</u> visual or a <u>Standard</u> <u>Colormap</u>.

              Choosing  a  composite  operator  is optional. The default operator is replace.  However, you must
              choose a location to composite your image and press button 1. Press and  hold  the  button  before
              releasing and an outline of the image will appear to help you identify your location.

              The  actual  colors  of the pasted image is saved. However, the color that appears in image window
              may be different. For example, on a monochrome screen image window will appear black or white even
              though your pasted image may have many colors. If the image is saved to a file it is written  with
              the  correct  colors.  To  assure the correct colors are saved in the final image, any <u>PseudoClass</u>
              image is promoted to <u>DirectClass</u>.  To  force  a  <u>PseudoClass</u>  image  to  remain  <u>PseudoClass</u>,  use
              <b>-colors</b>.

           <b>Help</b>
           <b>Dismiss</b>

       If  the  you choose the horizontal direction (this is the default), the area of the image between the two
       horizontal endpoints of the chop line is removed.  Otherwise, the area  of  the  image  between  the  two
       vertical endpoints of the chop line is removed.

       Select  a  location within the image window to begin your chop, press and hold any button. Next, move the
       pointer to another location in the image.  As you move a line will connect the initial location  and  the
       pointer.  When you release the button, the area within the image to chop is determined by which direction
       you choose from the Command widget.

       To cancel the image chopping, move the pointer back to the starting point of the  line  and  release  the
       button.

</pre><h4><b>IMAGE</b> <b>ROTATION</b></h4><pre>
       Press  the  / key to rotate the image 90 degrees or \ to rotate -90 degrees.  To interactively choose the
       degree of rotation, choose <b>Rotate...</b>  of the <b>Transform</b> submenu from the Command  Widget.   Alternatively,

       to the desired color on the screen and press any button.

       Choose  a  point  in  the  image window and press this button and hold. Next, move the pointer to another
       location in the image. As you move a line connects the initial location and the pointer. When you release
       the button, the degree of image rotation is determined by the slope of the line you just drew. The  slope
       is relative to the direction you choose from the Direction sub-menu of the Command widget.

       To  cancel  the  image  rotation, move the pointer back to the starting point of the line and release the
       button.

</pre><h4><b>IMAGE</b> <b>ANNOTATION</b></h4><pre>
       An image is annotated interactively. There is no command line argument to annotate an  image.  To  begin,

       Choose a composite operation from the Operators sub-menu of the Command widget. How each operator behaves
       is described below. image window is the image currently displayed on your X server and image is the image
       obtained

       <b>over</b>     The result is the union of the two image shapes, with <u>image</u> obscuring <u>image</u> <u>window</u> in the region
              of overlap.

       <b>in</b>      The result is simply <u>image</u> cut by the shape of <u>image</u> <u>window</u>.  None of the  image  data  of  image
              window is in the result.

       <b>out</b>     The resulting image is <u>image</u> with the shape of <u>image</u> <u>window</u> cut out.

       <b>atop</b>     The  result is the same shape as <u>image</u> <u>window</u>, with <u>image</u> obscuring <u>image</u> <u>window</u> where the image
              shapes overlap. Note this differs from over because the portion of image  outside  <u>image</u>  <u>window</u>'s
              shape does not appear in the result.

       <b>xor</b>     The result is the image data from both <u>image</u> and <u>image</u> <u>window</u> that is outside the overlap region.
              The overlap region is blank.

       <b>plus</b>     The  result  is  just the sum of the image data. Output values are cropped to 255 (no overflow).
              This operation is independent of the matte channels.

       <b>minus</b>   The result of <u>image</u> - <u>image</u> <u>window</u>, with underflow cropped to zero. The matte channel is  ignored
              (set to 255, full coverage).

       <b>add</b>     The result of <u>image</u> + <u>image</u> <u>window</u>, with overflow wrapping around (mod 256).

       <b>subtract</b>
                The  result  of  <u>image</u>  -  <u>image</u>  <u>window</u>,  with underflow wrapping around (mod 256). The add and
              subtract operators can be used to perform reversible transformations.

       <b>difference</b>
               The result of abs(<u>image</u> - <u>image</u> <u>window</u>). This is useful for comparing two very similar images.

       <b>bumpmap</b>
               The result of <u>image</u> <u>window</u> shaded by <u>window</u>.

       <b>replace</b>
               The resulting image is <u>image</u> <u>window</u> replaced with <u>image</u>.  Here the matte information is ignored.

              The image compositor requires a matte, or alpha channel in the image  for  some  operations.  This
              extra  channel  usually  defines  a mask which represents a sort of a cookie-cutter for the image.
              This is the case when matte is 255 (full coverage) for pixels inside the shape, zero outside,  and
              between  zero  and  255 on the boundary. If image does not have a matte channel, it is initialized
              with 0 for any pixel matching in color to pixel location (0,0), otherwise 255. See  Matte  Editing
              for a method of defining a matte channel.

              If  you  choose  <b>blend</b>,  the  composite  operator  becomes  <b>over</b>.  The image matte channel percent
              transparency is initialized to factor.  The image window is  initialized  to  (100-factor).  Where
              factor is the value you specify in the Dialog widget.

              <b>Displace</b>  shifts  the  image  pixels as defined by a displacement map.  With this option, <u>image</u> is
              used  as  a  displacement  map.  Black,  within  the  displacement  map,  is  a  maximum  positive
              displacement.  White  is  a  maximum  negative  displacement  and  middle  gray  is  neutral.  The
              displacement is scaled to determine the pixel shift. By default, the displacement applies in  both
              the  horizontal  and  vertical directions. However, if you specify <u>mask</u>, <u>image</u> is the horizontal X
              displacement and <u>mask</u> the vertical Y displacement.

              Note that matte information for image window is not retained  for  colormapped  X  server  visuals
              (e.g.   <u>StaticColor,</u>  <u>StaticColor,</u>  <u>GrayScale,</u>  <u>PseudoColor</u>).   Correct  compositing  behavior may
              require a <u>TrueColor</u> or <u>DirectColor</u> visual or a <u>Standard</u> <u>Colormap</u>.

              Choosing a composite operator is optional. The default operator is  replace.   However,  you  must
              choose  a  location  to  composite your image and press button 1. Press and hold the button before
              releasing and an outline of the image will appear to help you identify your location.

              The actual colors of the composite image is saved. However, the color that appears in image window
              may be different. For example, on a monochrome screen Image window will appear black or white even
              though your composited image may have many colors. If the image is saved to a file it  is  written
              with  the  correct  colors.  To  assure  the  correct  colors  are  saved  in the final image, any
              PseudoClass image is promoted to <u>DirectClass</u> (see miff).  To force a <u>PseudoClass</u> image  to  remain

       The  actual  color  you  request for the pixels is saved in the image. However, the color that appears in
       your Image window may be different. For example, on a monochrome screen the pixel will  appear  black  or
       white even if you choose the color red as the pixel color. However, the image saved to a file with -write
       is written with red pixels. To assure the correct color text in the final image, any <u>PseudoClass</u> image is
       promoted to <u>DirectClass</u> To force a <u>PseudoClass</u> image to remain <u>PseudoClass</u>, use <b>-colors</b>.

</pre><h4><b>MATTE</b> <b>EDITING</b></h4><pre>
       Matte  information  within  an  image is useful for some operations such as image compositing. This extra
       channel usually defines a mask which represents a sort of a cookie-cutter for the image. This is the case
       when matte is 255 (full coverage) for pixels inside the shape, zero outside, and between zero and 255  on
       the boundary.

       Setting  the  matte  information  in an image is done interactively. There is no command line argument to
       edit a pixel. To begin, and choose <b>Matte</b> of the <b>Image</b> <b>Edit</b> sub-menu from the Command widget.

       Alternatively, press m in the image window.

       A small window appears showing the location of the cursor in the image window. You are now in matte  edit
       mode. To exit immediately, press Dismiss.  In matte edit mode, the Command widget has these options:

       <b>Method</b>

       <b>Dismiss</b>

       Choose  a  matte  editing method from the <b>Method</b> sub-menu of the Command widget. The <b>point</b> <b>method</b> changes
       the matte value of the any pixel selected with the pointer until the  button  is  released.  The  <b>replace</b>
       <b>method</b>  changes the matte value of any pixel that matches the color of the pixel you select with a button
       press. <b>Floodfill</b> changes the matte value of any pixel that matches the color of the pixel you select with
       a button press and is a neighbor. Whereas <b>filltoborder</b> recolors any neighbor pixel that is not the border
       color. Finally <b>reset</b> changes the entire image to the designated matte value.  Choose <b>Matte</b>  <b>Value</b>  and  a
       dialog  appears requesting a matte value.  Enter a value between <b>0</b> <b>and</b> <b>255</b>. This value is assigned as the
       matte value of the selected pixel or pixels.  Now, press any button to select a pixel  within  the  Image
       window  to  change its matte value. You can change the matte value of additional pixels by increasing the
       Delta value. The Delta value is first added then subtracted from the red, green, and blue of  the  target
       color. Any pixels within the range also have their matte value updated.  If the <b>Magnify</b> <b>widget</b> is mapped,
       it can be helpful in positioning your pointer within the image (refer to button 2). Alternatively you can
       select a pixel to change the matte value from within the <b>Magnify</b> <b>widget</b>.  Move the pointer to the <b>Magnify</b>
       <b>widget</b>  and  position the pixel with the cursor control keys. Finally, press a button to change the matte
       value of the selected pixel (or pixels).  Matte  information  is  only  valid  in  a  <u>DirectClass</u>  <u>image</u>.
       Therefore,  any <u>PseudoClass</u> image is promoted to <u>DirectClass</u>. Note that matte information for <u>PseudoClass</u>
       is not retained for colormapped X server visuals (e.g. <u>StaticColor,</u> <u>StaticColor,</u> <u>GrayScale,</u>  <u>PseudoColor</u>)
       unless  you  immediately  save  your image to a file (refer to Write). Correct matte editing behavior may
       require a <u>TrueColor</u> or <u>DirectColor</u> visual or a <u>Standard</u> <u>Colormap</u>.

</pre><h4><b>IMAGE</b> <b>DRAWING</b></h4><pre>
       An image is drawn upon interactively. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>command</b> <b>line</b> <b>argument</b> <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b>  <b>image</b>.  To  begin,
       choose  <b>Draw</b>  of  the  Image  <b>Edit</b> sub-menu from the Command widget.  Alternatively, press d in the image
       window.

       The cursor changes to a crosshair to indicate you are in draw mode. To exit immediately,  press  Dismiss.
       In draw mode, the Command widget has these options:

       Choose a drawing primitive from the <b>Primitive</b> sub-menu.

       Next,  choose a color from the <b>Color</b> sub-menu. Additional colors can be specified with the color browser.
       You can change the menu colors by setting the X  resources  pen1  through  pen9.  The  transparent  color
       updates the image matte channel and is useful for image compositing.

       If  you choose the color browser and press <b>Grab</b>, you can select the primitive color by moving the pointer
       to the desired color on the screen and press any button. The transparent color updates  the  image  matte
       channel and is useful for image compositing.

       Choose  a  stipple,  if appropriate, from the <b>Stipple</b> sub-menu. Additional stipples can be specified with
       the file browser. Stipples obtained from the file browser must be on disk in the X11 bitmap format.

       Choose a line width, if appropriate, from the <b>Width</b> sub-menu. To  choose  a  specific  width  select  the
       <b>Dialog</b> widget.

       Choose  a  point  in  the  image  window  and  press button 1 and hold. Next, move the pointer to another
       location in the image. As you move, a line connects the  initial  location  and  the  pointer.  When  you
       release  the  button,  the  image is updated with the primitive you just drew. For polygons, the image is
       updated when you press and release the button without moving the pointer.

       To cancel image drawing, move the pointer back to the starting point of the line and release the button.

</pre><h4><b>REGION</b> <b>OF</b> <b>INTEREST</b></h4><pre>
       To begin, press choose Region of Interest of the  Pixel  Transform  sub-menu  from  the  Command  widget.
       Alternatively, press R in the image window.

       A  small  window appears showing the location of the cursor in the image window. You are now in region of
       interest mode. In region of interest mode, the Command widget has these options:

       You can make adjustments to the region of interest by moving the pointer to one of the rectangle corners,
       pressing  a  button, and dragging. Finally, choose an image processing technique from the Command widget.
       You can choose more than one image processing technique to apply to an area. Alternatively, you can  move
       the region of interest before applying another image processing technique. To exit, press Dismiss.

</pre><h4><b>IMAGE</b> <b>PANNING</b></h4><pre>
       When  an image exceeds the width or height of the X server screen, display maps a small panning icon. The
       rectangle within the panning icon shows the area that is currently displayed in the the image window.  To
       pan  about  the  image, press any button and drag the pointer within the panning icon.  The pan rectangle
       moves with the pointer and the image window is updated to reflect the location of  the  rectangle  within
       the panning icon. When you have selected the area of the image you wish to view, release the button.

       Use the arrow keys to pan the image one pixel up, down, left, or right within the image window.

       The panning icon is withdrawn if the image becomes smaller than the dimensions of the X server screen.

</pre><h4><b>USER</b> <b>PREFERENCES</b></h4><pre>
       Preferences  affect  the default behavior of <b><a href="../man1/display.1.html">display</a>(1)</b>. The preferences are either true or false and are
       stored in your home directory as .displayrc:

                <b>display</b> <b>image</b> <b>centered</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>backdrop</b>"

                    This backdrop covers the entire workstation screen and is useful for hiding other  X  window
                    activity  while  viewing the image. The color of the backdrop is specified as the background
                    color. Refer to X Resources for details.
                <b>confirm</b> <b>on</b> <b>program</b> <b>exit</b>"

                    Ask for a confirmation before exiting the <b><a href="../man1/display.1.html">display</a>(1)</b> program.
                <b>correct</b> <b>image</b> <b>for</b> <b>display</b> <b>gamma</b>"

                    If the image has a known gamma, the gamma is corrected to match that of the  X  server  (see
                    the X Resource <b>displayGamma</b>).
                <b>display</b> <b>warning</b> <b>messages</b>"

                    Display any warning messages.
                <b>apply</b> <b>Floyd/Steinberg</b> <b>error</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>to</b> <b>image</b>"

                    The  basic  strategy of dithering is to trade intensity resolution for spatial resolution by
                    averaging the intensities of several neighboring pixels.  Images which  suffer  from  severe
                    contouring when reducing colors can be improved with this preference.
                <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>shared</b> <b>colormap</b> <b>for</b> <b>colormapped</b> <b>X</b> <b>visuals</b>"

                    This option only applies when the default X server visual is <u>PseudoColor</u> or <u>GRAYScale</u>. Refer
                    to  <b>-visual</b>  for  more details. By default, a shared colormap is allocated. The image shares
                    colors with other X clients.  Some image colors could be approximated, therefore your  image
                    may look very different than intended. Otherwise the image colors appear exactly as they are
                    defined. However, other clients may go technicolor when the image colormap is installed.
                <b>display</b> <b>images</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>X</b> <b>server</b> <b>pixmap</b>"

                    Images  are maintained as a XImage by default. Set this resource to True to utilize a server
                    Pixmap instead. This option is useful if your image exceeds the dimensions  of  your  server
                    screen  and  you  intend  to  pan the image. Panning is much faster with Pixmaps than with a
                    XImage. Pixmaps are considered a precious resource, use them with discretion.

       <b>GM</b> <b>IDENTIFY</b>

              <b>Identify</b> describes the format and characteristics  of  one  or  more  image  files  as  internally
              supported  by  the  software.  It  will  also  report  if  an image is incomplete or corrupt.  The
              information displayed includes the scene number, the file name, the width and height of the image,
              whether the image is colormapped or not, the number of colors in the image, the number of bytes in
              the image, the format of the image (JPEG, PNM, etc.), and finally the number of  seconds  in  both
              user  time  and  elapsed  time  it  took  to read and process the image.  If -verbose or +ping are
              provided as an option, the pixel read rate is also displayed. An example line output from <b>identify</b>
              follows:

</pre><h4><b>GM</b> <b>IMPORT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Import</b> reads an image from any visible window on an X server and outputs it as an  image  file.  You  can
       capture  a  single  window, the entire screen, or any rectangular portion of the screen.  Use <u>display</u> for
       redisplay, printing, editing, formatting, archiving, image processing, etc. of the captured image.

       The target window can be specified by id, name, or may be selected by clicking the mouse in  the  desired
       window.  If  you  press  a button and then drag, a rectangle will form which expands and contracts as the
       mouse moves. To save the portion of the screen defined by the rectangle, just  release  the  button.  The
       keyboard bell is rung once at the beginning of the screen capture and twice when it completes.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To  select  an X window or an area of the screen with the mouse and save it in the MIFF image format to a
       file entitled window.miff, use:

           gm import window.miff

       To select an X window or an area of the screen with the mouse and save it in the Encapsulated  PostScript
       format to include in another document, use:

           gm import figure.eps

       To  capture  the  entire  X  server screen in the JPEG image format in a file entitled root.jpeg, without
       using the mouse, use:

           gm import -window root root.jpeg

       To capture the 512x256 area at the upper right corner of the X server screen in the PNG image format in a
       well-compressed file entitled corner.png, without using the mouse,  use:

           gm import -window root -crop 512x256-0+0 -quality 90
                  corner.png

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options are processed in command line order. Any option you specify on the command line remains in effect
       until it is explicitly changed by specifying the option again with a different effect.

       <b>Import</b> options can appear on the command line or in your X resources  file.  See  <u><a href="../man1/X.1.html">X</a>(1)</u>.  Options  on  the

</pre><h4><b>GM</b> <b>MOGRIFY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Mogrify</b>  transforms  an  image  or  a  sequence  of images. These transforms include image scaling, image
       rotation, color reduction, and others. Each transmogrified image overwrites  the  corresponding  original
       image,  unless  an  option  such  as  <b>-format</b>  causes  the output filename to be different from the input
       filename.

       The graphics formats supported by <b>mogrify</b> are listed in <u><a href="../man1/GraphicsMagick.1.html">GraphicsMagick</a>(1)</u>.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To convert all the TIFF files in a particular directory to JPEG, use:

           gm mogrify -format jpeg *.tiff

       To convert a directory full of JPEG images to thumbnails, use:

           gm mogrify -size 120x120 *.jpg -resize 120x120 +profile "*"

       In this example, '-size 120x120' gives a hint to the JPEG  decoder  that  the  images  are  going  to  be
       downscaled  to  120x120,  allowing  it  to  run  faster  by  avoiding returning full-resolution images to
       GraphicsMagick for the subsequent resizing  operation.   The  ´-resize  120x120'  specifies  the  desired
       dimensions  of  the  output  images.   It  will  be  scaled  so its largest dimension is 120 pixels.  The
       ´+profile "*"' removes any ICM, EXIF, IPTC, or other profiles that might be  present  in  the  input  and
       aren't needed in the thumbnails.

       To scale an image of a cockatoo to exactly 640 pixels in width and 480 pixels in height, use:

           gm mogrify -resize 640x480! cockatoo.miff

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options are processed in command line order. Any option you specify on the command line remains in effect
       for the set of images that follows, until the set is terminated by the appearance of any option or <b>-noop</b>.

</pre><h4><b>GM</b> <b>MONTAGE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>montage</b>  creates  a  composite  image  by  combining several separate images. The images are tiled on the
       composite image with the name of the image optionally appearing just below the individual tile.

       The composite image is constructed in the following manner. First, each image specified  on  the  command
       line,  except  for  the last, is scaled to fit the maximum tile size. The maximum tile size by default is
       120x120.  It can be modified with the <b>-geometry</b> command line argument or X resource. See <b>Options</b> for more
       information on command line arguments. See <b><a href="../man1/X.1.html">X</a>(1)</b> for more information  on  X  resources.   Note  that  the
       maximum tile size need not be a square.

       Next the composite image is initialized with the color specified by the <b>-background</b> command line argument
       or  X  resource.  The  width  and height of the composite image is determined by the title specified, the
       maximum tile size, the number of tiles per row, the tile border width and height, the image border width,
       and the label height. The number of tiles per row specifies how many images are to appear in each row  of
       the  composite  image.  The  default  is  to  have  5 tiles in each row and 4 tiles in each column of the
       composite.  A specific value is specified with <b>-tile</b>. The tile border width and  height,  and  the  image
       border  width  defaults  to  the  value  of  the  X  resource  <b>-borderwidth</b>.  It  can be changed with the
       <b>-borderwidth</b> or <b>-geometry</b> command line argument or X resource. The label height is determined by the font
       you specify with the <b>-font</b> command line argument or X resource. If you do not specify a font, a  font  is
       chosen  that  allows the name of the image to fit the maximum width of a tiled area.  The label colors is
       determined by the <b>-background</b> and <b>-fill</b> command line argument or X resource. Note, that if the background
       and pen colors are the same, labels will not appear.

       Initially, the composite image title is placed at the top if one is specified  (refer  to  <b>-fill</b>).  Next,
       each  image  is set onto the composite image, surrounded by its border color, with its name centered just
       below it. The individual images are left-justified within the width of the tiled area.  The order of  the
       images  is the same as they appear on the command line unless the images have a scene keyword. If a scene
       number is specified in each image, then the images are tiled onto the composite in  the  order  of  their
       scene number. Finally, the last argument on the command line is the name assigned to the composite image.
       By default, the image is written in the <b>MIFF</b> format and can be viewed or printed with <u><a href="../man1/display.1.html">display</a>(1)</u>.

       Note,  that  if the number of tiles exceeds the default number of 20 (5 per row, 4 per column), more than
       one composite image is created. To ensure a single image is produced, use <b>-tile</b> to increase the number of
       tiles to meet or exceed the number of input images.

       Finally, to create one or more empty spaces in the sequence of tiles, use the <b>"NULL:"</b> image format.

       Note, a composite MIFF image displayed to an X server with <b>display</b> behaves differently than other images.
       You can think of the composite as a visual image directory. Choose a particular tile of the composite and
       press a button to display it. See <b><a href="../man1/display.1.html">display</a>(1)</b> and <b><a href="../man5/miff.5.html">miff</a>(5)</b>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To create a montage of a cockatoo, a parrot, and a hummingbird and write it to a file called birds, use:

           gm montage cockatoo.miff parrot.miff hummingbird.miff
                   birds.miff

       To tile several bird images so that they are at most 256 pixels  in  width  and  192  pixels  in  height,
       surrounded by a red border, and separated by 10 pixels of background color, use:

           gm montage -geometry 256x192+10+10 -bordercolor red
                   birds.* montage.miff

       To create an unlabeled parrot image, 640 by 480 pixels, and surrounded by a border of black, use:

           gm montage -geometry 640x480 -bordercolor black
                   -label "" parrot.miff bird.miff

       To create an image of an eagle with a textured background, use:

           gm montage -texture bumps.jpg eagle.jpg eagle.png

       To  join  several  GIF  images together without any extraneous graphics (e.g.  no label, no shadowing, no
       surrounding tile frame), use:

           gm montage +frame +shadow +label -tile 5x1
                   -geometry 50x50+0+0 *.png joined.png

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Any option you specify on the command line remains in effect for the group of images following it,  until
       the  group  is  terminated  by  the appearance of any option or <b>-noop</b>.  For example, to make a montage of
       three images, the first with 32 colors, the second with an unlimited number of colors, and the third with
       only 16 colors, use:

           gm montage -colors 32 cockatoo.1 -noop cockatoo.2
                    -colors 16 cockatoo.3 cockatoos.miff

</pre><h4><b>X</b> <b>RESOURCES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Montage</b> options can appear on the command line or in your X resource file. Options on  the  command  line
       supersede values specified in your X resource file. See <b><a href="../man1/X.1.html">X</a>(1)</b> for more information on X resources.

       All <b>montage</b> options have a corresponding X resource. In addition, <b>montage</b> uses the following X resources:

       <b>background</b> <u>(class</u> <u>Background)</u>
              background color

              Specifies the preferred color to use for the composite image background.  The default is #ccc.

       <b>borderColor</b> <u>(class</u> <u>BorderColor)</u>
              border color

              Specifies the preferred color to use for the composite image border. The default is #ccc.

       <b>borderWidth</b> <u>(class</u> <u>BorderWidth)</u>
              border width

              Specifies the width in pixels of the composite image border. The default is 2.

       <b>font</b> <u>(class</u> <u>Font)</u>
              font to use

              Specifies  the  name of the preferred font to use when displaying text within the composite image.
              The default is 9x15, fixed, or 5x8 determined by the composite image size.

       <b>matteColor</b> <u>(class</u> <u>MatteColor)</u>
              color of the frame

              Specify the color of an image frame. A 3D effect is achieved by using highlight and shadow  colors
              derived from this color. The default value is #697B8F.

       <b>pen</b> <u>(class</u> <u>Pen)</u>
              text color

              Specifies the preferred color to use for text within the composite image.  The default is black.

       <b>title</b> <u>(class</u> <u>Title)</u>
              composite image title

              This  resource  specifies the title to be placed at the top of the composite image. The default is
              not to place a title at the top of the composite image.

</pre><h4><b>GM</b> <b>TIME</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>time</b> executes an arbitrary <b>gm</b> utility command (e.g. <b>convert</b>) and reports the user and elapsed time.  This
       provides way to measure command execution times similar to the Unix ´time' command but in a portable  and
       consistent way.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To obtain time information for the execution of a command:

       % gm time convert input.ppm -gaussian 0x2 output.ppm
       convert input.ppm -gaussian 0x2 output.ppm    22.60s user 0.00s system 2354% cpu 0.960 total
       Here is the interpretation of the above output:

           <b>user</b> - the total user time consumed.
           <b>system</b> - the total system time consumed.
           <b>total</b> - the total elapsed time consumed.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The time command reqires no options other than the gm command to execute.

</pre><h4><b>GM</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>version</b>  displays  the  software  release  version,  build  quantum  (pixel  sample) depth, web site URL,
       copyright notice, enabled features support, configuration parameters, and final  build  options  used  to
       build  the  software.   The available information depends on how the software was configured and the host
