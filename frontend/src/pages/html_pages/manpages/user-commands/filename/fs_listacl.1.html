       fs_listacl - Displays ACLs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fs</b> <b>listacl</b> [<b>-path</b> &lt;<u>dir/file</u> <u>path</u>&gt;+] [<b>-id</b>] [<b>-if</b>] [<b>-cmd</b>] [<b>-help</b>]

       <b>fs</b> <b>la</b> [<b>-p</b> &lt;<u>dir/file</u> <u>path</u>&gt;+] [<b>-id</b>] [<b>-if</b>] [<b>-cmd</b>] [<b>-h</b>]

       <b>fs</b> <b>lista</b> [<b>-p</b> &lt;<u>dir/file</u> <u>path</u>&gt;+] [<b>-id</b>] [<b>-if</b>] [<b>-cmd</b>] [<b>-h</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>fs</b> <b>listacl</b> command displays the access control list (ACL) associated with each specified file,
       directory, or symbolic link. The specified element can reside in the DFS filespace if the issuer is using
       the AFS/DFS Migration Toolkit Protocol Translator to access DFS data (and DFS does implement per-file
       ACLs). To display the ACL of the current working directory, omit the <b>-path</b> argument.

       To alter an ACL, use the <b>fs</b> <b>setacl</b> command. To copy an ACL from one directory to another, use the <b>fs</b>
       <b>copyacl</b> command. To remove obsolete entries from an ACL, use the <b>fs</b> <b>cleanacl</b> command.

</pre><h4><b>CAUTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Placing a user or group on the "Negative rights" section of the ACL does not guarantee denial of
       permissions, if the "Normal rights" section grants the permissions to members of the system:anyuser
       group. In that case, the user needs only to issue the <b>unlog</b> command to obtain the permissions granted to
       the system:anyuser group.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-path</b> &lt;<u>dir/file</u> <u>path</u>&gt;+
           Names each directory or file for which to display the ACL. For AFS files, the output displays the ACL
           from  the  file's  parent  directory;  DFS  files  do  have  their  own ACL. Incomplete pathnames are
           interpreted relative to the current working directory, which  is  also  the  default  value  if  this
           argument is omitted.

       <b>-id</b> Displays  the  Initial  Container  ACL  of each DFS directory. This argument is supported only on DFS
           directories accessed via the AFS/DFS Migration Toolkit Protocol Translator.

       <b>-if</b> Displays the Initial Object ACL of each DFS  directory.  This  argument  is  supported  only  on  DFS
           directories accessed via the AFS/DFS Migration Toolkit Protocol Translator.

       <b>-cmd</b>
           Outputs  an  <b>fs</b>  <b>setacl</b>  command string that can be used to recreate the ACL applied to the specified
           file, directory or symbolic link.

       <b>-help</b>
           Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       The first line of the output for each file, directory, or symbolic link reads as follows:

          Access list for &lt;directory&gt; is

       If the issuer used shorthand notation in the pathname, such as the period (".") to represent the  current
       current directory, that notation sometimes appears instead of the full pathname of the directory.

       Next,  the  "Normal  rights"  header  precedes  a  list of users and groups who are granted the indicated
       permissions, with one pairing of user or group and permissions on each line. If negative permissions have
       been assigned to any user or group, those entries follow  a  "Negative  rights"  header.  The  format  of
       negative entries is the same as those on the "Normal rights" section of the ACL, but the user or group is
       denied rather than granted the indicated permissions.

       AFS  does  not  implement per-file ACLs, so for a file the command displays the ACL on its directory. The
       output for a symbolic link displays the ACL that applies to its target file or directory, rather than the
       ACL on the directory that houses the symbolic link.

       The permissions for AFS enable the possessor to perform the indicated action:

       a (administer)
           Change the entries on the ACL.

       d (delete)
           Remove files and subdirectories from the directory or move them to other directories.

       i (insert)
           Add files or subdirectories to the directory by copying, moving or creating.

       k (lock)
           Set read locks or write locks on the files in the directory.

       l (lookup)
           List the files and subdirectories in the directory, stat the  directory  itself,  and  issue  the  <b>fs</b>
           <b>listacl</b> command to examine the directory's ACL.

       r (read)
           Read  the  contents  of files in the directory; issue the "ls -l" command to stat the elements in the
           directory.

       w (write)
           Modify the contents of files in the directory, and issue the UNIX <b>chmod</b> command to change their  mode
           bits

       A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H
           Have  no  default meaning to the AFS server processes, but are made available for applications to use
           in controlling access to the directory's contents in additional ways. The letters must be uppercase.

       For DFS files and directories, the permissions are similar, except that the DFS "x" (execute)  permission
       replaces  the  AFS "l" (lookup) permission, DFS "c" (control) replaces AFS "a" (administer), and there is
       no DFS equivalent to the AFS "k" (lock) permission. The meanings of the various permissions  also  differ
       slightly, and DFS does not implement negative permissions. For a complete description of DFS permissions,
       see the DFS documentation.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  command  displays  the  ACL  on the home directory of the user "pat" (the current working
       directory), and on its "private" subdirectory.

          % fs listacl -path . private
          Access list for . is
          Normal rights:
             system:authuser rl
             pat rlidwka
             pat:friends rlid
          Negative rights:
             smith rlidwka
          Access list for private is
          Normal rights:
             pat rlidwka

       The following command generates the <b>fs</b> <b>setacl</b> command required to recreate the ACL on the home  directory
       of the user "pat" (the current working directory), and on its "private" subdirectory.

          % fs listacl -path . private -cmd
          fs setacl -dir . -acl system:authuser rl  pat rlidwka   pat:friends rlid
          fs setacl -dir . -acl smith rlidwka -negative
          fs setacl -dir private -acl pat rlidwka

</pre><h4><b>PRIVILEGE</b> <b>REQUIRED</b></h4><pre>
       If the <b>-path</b> argument names an AFS directory, the issuer must have the "l" (lookup) permission on its ACL
       and the ACL for every directory that precedes it in the pathname.

       If the <b>-path</b> argument names an AFS file, the issuer must have the "l" (lookup) and "r" (read) permissions
       on the ACL of the file's directory, and the <b>l</b> permission on the ACL of each directory that precedes it in
       the pathname.

       If the <b>-path</b> argument names a DFS directory or file, the issuer must have the "x" (execute) permission on
       its ACL and on the ACL of each directory that precedes it in the pathname.
