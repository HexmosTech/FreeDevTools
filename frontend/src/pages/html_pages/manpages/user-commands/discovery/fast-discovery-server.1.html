       fast-discovery-server - centralized broker for DDS service discovery

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fast-discovery-server</b> <b>-i</b> <u>ID</u> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       eProsima  Fast DDS, as a Data Distribution Service (DDS) middleware implementation, offers the feature of
       dynamically discovering communication entities within a  network.  The  DDS  standard  defines  a  Simple
       Discovery Protocol (SDP) to accomplish such a task, sharing the participants information using well known
       multicast  addresses  and  ports.  While  this  method  has  the  advantage of out-of-the-box participant
       discovery, it has the disadvantage of scalability,  since  the  number  of  exchanged  packets  increases
       exponentially  as  new  participants  are  added  to  the  system.  Furthermore, it requires multicasting
       capabilities, which may not work reliably (such as for the case of WiFi communication [1]),  or  may  not
       even be present at all. Therefore, eProsima Fast DDS implements the Discovery Server (DS) protocol, which
       is  a  new  discovery mechanism based on a centralized communications model. In this, a core participant,
       referred to as a Server, handles all the information exchanged between participants on the network.

       <b>fast-discovery-server</b> accepts the following arguments:

       <b>-i</b> <u>ID</u>
       <b>--server-id</b> <u>ID</u>
              This is a mandatory argument for the unique server identifier.  Specifies the  zero  based  server
              position in the <b>ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER</b> variable.

       <b>-l</b> <u>IP</u>
       <b>--ip-address</b> <u>IP</u>
              Server interface on which to listen to the clients. Defaults to any (0.0.0.0).

       <b>-p</b> <u>PORT</u>
       <b>--port</b> <u>PORT</u>
              UDP port on which to listen to the clients. Defaults to 11811

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--backup</b>
              Creates a server with a backup file associated
