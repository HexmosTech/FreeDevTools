       xd - eXtra fast Directory changer

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xd</b> [OPTIONS] <u>arguments</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The program <b>xd</b> is used to perform e<b>X</b>tra fast <b>D</b>irectory changes. Usually to change a directory the user is
       required to enter a command like, e.g., <u>cd</u> <u><a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a></u>, possibly using shell completion. Often this is
       a  tedious  task:  shell  completion  shows  all  entries, including files, when we’re only interested in
       directories and the full specification of our intented directory may  eventually  require  many  keyboard
       actions.

       <u>Xd</u>  was  designed  a long time ago (in the early 90s) to reduce the effort of changing directories. Often
       we’re well aware to which directory we want to change, and it’s easy to  provide  the  initial  directory
       characters  of  that  directory. E.g., if the intent is to <u>cd</u> to <u><a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a></u>, it’s easy to specify the
       letters <u>ulb</u>.

       <u>Xd</u> capitalizes on this capability. By providing  the  initial  directory  characters  of  directories  <u>xd</u>
       determines  the expansion(s) allowing you to do fast directory changes. So, after entering the command <u>xd</u>
       <u>ulb</u> <u>xd</u> may directly perform the change-directory to <u><a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a></u>.

       Often, however, multiple alternatives can match the specified series of characters. E.g.,  when  entering
       <u>xd</u> <u>ulb</u> <u>xd</u> may find several alternatives, like

        1: /usr/lib/base-config
        2: /usr/lib/bonobo
        3: /usr/lib/bonobo-activation
        4: <a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a>

       If these are the alternatives, then this is exactly what <u>xd</u> shows you. Then, by simply pressing the <u>4</u> key
       (<u>no</u> <u>Enter</u> key required) <u>xd</u> performs the required <u><a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a></u> (see also the section <b>DIRECT</b> <b>KEY</b> <b>ENTRY</b>).

       <u>Xd’s</u> behavior can be fine-tuned in various ways:

       o      by default (as specified by the configuration file, see below) <u>xd</u> looks for expansions starting at
              the user’s home directory or at the system’s root directory;

       o      initial  character <b>/</b>: if the first character of the command is <u>/</u> then all expansions are performed
              from the system’s root directory. E.g., <u>xd</u> <u>/t</u> produces <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u> but not <u>/home/user/tmp</u>;

       o      initial character <b>.</b>: if the first character of the command is <u>.</u> then by default all expansions are
              performed from the user’s home directory. E.g., <u>xd</u> <u>.t</u> results in <u>/home/user/tmp</u> but not  in  <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u>.
              The home directory recognition character can be altered using the <u>--homedir-char</u> option, see below
              (section <b>OPTIONS</b>). When merely specifying <u>xd</u> <u>.</u> then <u>xd</u> changes the current directory to the user’s
              home directory.

       o      initial  character <b>0</b>: If the first character of the command is <u>0</u>, then all expansions start at the
              current working directory. When merely specifying <u>xd</u>  <u>0</u>  then  <u>xd</u>  returns  leaving   the  current
              directory  unchanged. When additional characters are appended to 0 then this command operates like
              the following, starting from the current working directory;

       o      initial character <b>1..9</b>: If the first character of the command is a digit between <u>1</u> and <u>9</u> then  all
              expansions  start  at  that  parent  directory  level  of the current working directory (up to the
              system’s root directory). E.g., if the current working directory is  <u><a href="file:/usr/share/doc">/usr/share/doc</a></u>  then  <u>xd</u>  <u>2lb</u>
              will offer the alternative <u><a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a></u>: two steps up, then look for directories starting with <u>l</u>
              and therein directories starting with <u>b</u>. When merely specifying one of these characters <u>xd</u> changes
              the  current directory to the indicated parent, up to the root-directory (e.g., specifying <u>xd</u> <u>5</u> at
              <u><a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a></u> changes the current directory to the root-directory)

       o      separators (space, and the forward slash (`<u>/</u>’)):  sometimes  it  is  clear  that  there  are  many
              alternatives  and  the intention is to reduce that number. By using separators subsequently nested
              directories must start with the characters between the separators. E.g., <u>xd</u> <u>u</u> <u>l</u> <u>bi</u> doesn’t produce
              the alternative <u>/usr/lib/base-config</u> anymore, since <u>base-config</u> does not start with  <u>bi</u>.  In  this
              case  only  <u><a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a></u>  is  produced.  When used as initial character in a pattern the forward
              slash always indicates the root-directory;

       o      search patterns may contain dots (like <u>.s</u>). In such cases the dot represents  hidden  directories.
              However,  <u>xd</u> usually also finds patterns containing <u><a href="file:/./">/./</a></u>, as the current directory matches the dot.
              Such patterns are considered spurious and are not reported.

       If there’s only one solution, <u>Xd</u> prepares for a direct directory change to the solution’s directory.

       If there are multiple solutions, then by default lists of at most 62 alternatives  (10  for  the  numbers
       0..9,  26 for the letters a..z and 26 for the letters A..Z) are written to the standard error stream from
       which the user may select an alternative by simply pressing the key  associated  with  the  selection  of
       choice. If no selection is requested any other key may be pressed (e.g., the space bar or the <u>Enter</u> key).
       If there is no solutioon <u>xd</u> writes the text <u>No</u> <u>Solutions</u> to the standard error stream.

       When  <u>xd</u>  is given at least one argument, all its output is sent to the standard error stream, except for
       the selected directory name which should become the next working directory.

       <u>Xd</u> may insert the <u>cd</u> command directly into the command shell from where <u>xd</u> was called. See  also  section
       <b>SHELL</b>  <b>SCRIPTS</b>). In this mode of operation <u>xd</u> returns a single dot if no selection is made, preventing an
       unintended change of directory.

       If no selection is made or if the selection process is aborted a single dot is written  to  the  standard
       output stream. Usually <u>xd</u> will be called by a shell alias, providing the <u>cd</u> command with <u>xd</u>’s output (see
       below  at  the  <b>SHELL</b>  <b>SCRIPTS</b>  section) executing <u>cd</u> <u>`xd</u> <u>$*`</u>. The default dot produced by <u>xd</u> prevents an
       unintended change of directory.

       When <u>xd</u> is merely given an initial directory specification, like a single dot (<u>.</u>) or digit  (a  digit  in
       the  set  <u>[0..9]</u>)  then <u>xd</u> returns the implied path. Specifying a parent before the root-directory (E.g.,
       entering `<u>xd</u> <u>5</u>’ when the current working directory is `<u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u>’) results in writing the root directory (`<u>/</u>’)
       to the standard output stream.

       If <u>xd</u> is called without arguments its <u>usage</u> information is written to the standard error stream.

       <u>Xd</u> may be further configured using options and  a  configuration  file,  discussed  in  the  <b>OPTIONS</b>  and
       <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b> sections below.

</pre><h4><b>DIRECT</b> <b>KEY</b> <b>ENTRY</b></h4><pre>
       To  pass  the  directory  change command to the shell’s input buffer <b>xd</b> calls the function <b><a href="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl</a></b>(2). That
       function is still available, although it’s also considered  a  somewhat  deprecated  function.  But  even
       though  it’s  available,  by  default  it  may not work. The program <b><a href="../man8/sysctl.8.html">sysctl</a></b>(8) shows the values of system
       variables, among which <u>dev.tty.legacy_tiocsti</u>:

           sysctl -a | grep tiocsti
           dev.tty.legacy_tiocsti = 0

       If,   at   your   computer,   <u>sysctl</u>   shows   <u>dev.tty.legacy_tiocsti</u>   <u>=</u>   <u>0</u>   then   define   a    file
       <u>/etc/sysctl.d/tiocsti.conf</u> containing the line

           dev.tty.legacy_tiocsti=1

       Then, after rebooting <u>ioctl</u> will work as described in its man-page.

       Alternatively, a shell script or alias can be defined to pass the command to your shell. E.g., when using
       the <u>tcsh</u> shell program the following alias can be defined:

           alias xd ’cd `\xd --no-input \!*`’
       Or, when using <u>bash</u>, define a function <u>xd</u> calling, e.g., <u>/usr/bin/xd</u>:

           xd()
           {
               cd `/usr/bin/xd --no-input "$*"`
           }

</pre><h4><b>GENERALIZED</b> <b>DIRECTORY</b> <b>SEARCH</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Xd</u>  also  supports  generalized  directory search commands (GDS). When GDS is requested separators are no
       longer required,  and  <u>xd</u>  finds  all  possible  alternatives  resulting  from  all  possible  sequential
       combinations  of  the  initial  search command. GDS is activated either by specifying the <u>-g</u> option or by
       entering <u>generalized-search</u> in <u>xd</u>’s configuration file. Alternatively, when the latter is specified  then
       the <u>--traditional</u> command line option suppresses GDS.

       When  using  GDS each initial substring of the command to <u>xd</u> is considered as the initial characters of a
       directory. E.g., if the command <u>xd</u> <u>tmps</u> is entered using GDS  then  directories  matching  the  following
       search patterns will be found;

       o      <u>/t*/m*/p*/s*/</u>

       o      <u>/t*/m*/ps*/</u>

       o      <u>/t*/mp*/s*/</u>

       o      <u>/t*/mps*/</u>

       o      <u>/tm*/p*/s*/</u>

       o      <u>/tm*/ps*/</u>

       o      <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>*/s*/</u>

       o      <u>/tmps*/</u>  With  the traditional processing mode only the first one of these alternative patterns is
              considered.

       Multiple command line arguments, the slash, and the underscore can still be used with GDS. In  this  case
       they  force  a  directory  change  using  the  considered  patterns.  E.g., with the command <u>xd</u> <u>tm/ps</u> the
       following patterns will be considered:

       o      <u>/t*/m*/p*/s*/</u>

       o      <u>/t*/m*/ps*/</u>

       o      <u>/tm*/p*/s*/</u>

       o      <u>/tm*/ps*/</u> In this set all of the previous patterns showing the <u>...mp...</u>  combination were dropped,
              as a directory change is forced between the <u>m</u> and <u>p</u> characters.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Xd</u> may return the following values to its caller, allowing scripts calling  <u>xd</u>  to  make  decisions  that
       depend on the actually performed action by <u>xd</u>:

       o      0 is returned if <u>xd</u> issued a <u>cd</u> command;

       o      1  is  returned if <u>xd</u> received a non-space character, not selecting a directory to change to. When
              the <u>input</u> option has been specified this character is inserted  into  the  command  shell’s  input
              buffer;

       o      2  is  returned  if <u>xd</u> received a space (or Enter) character, indicating that <u>xd</u> should perform no
              further action;

       o      3 is returned if no directory was found matching the argument passed to <u>xd</u>;

       o      4 is returned if the <u>--help</u> or <u>--version</u> option was  specified  (see  their  descriptions  in  the
              <u>OPTIONS</u> section);

       o      5  is  returned  if  an  error  was  encountered  (e.g., when a non-existing configuration file is
              specified).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       If available, single letter options are listed between parentheses following their associated long-option
       variants. Single letter options require arguments if their associated long options require  arguments  as
       well.

       Most  options  can  also  be specified in <u>xd’s</u> configuration file, in which case the long option variants
       must be used, omitting the initial two dashes (see the section  <u>CONFIGURATION</u>  <u>FILE</u>  below  for  specific
       details about the configuration file.

       By default the options can also be specified in the configuration file. If an option cannot be specifiied
       in the configuration file it is explicitly stated at its description.

       Options  that  are  specified  as  command-line  options  take  priority  over  options  specified in the
       configuration file.

       o      <b>--add-root</b> <u>condition</u>
              If the search starts at the user’s home directory an additional search starting  at  the  system’s
              root directory may be performed as well, depending on the value specified for the <u>add-root</u> option.
              Conditions are

              o      <u>never</u> (no additional search is performed),

              o      <u>if-empty</u>  (an  additional  search  is  performed  if  the  initial search did not yield any
                     directory),

              o      <u>always</u> (an additional search is always performed);

       o      <b>--all</b> <b>-a</b>
              If the configuration file (see below) contains <u>ignore</u> directives then those directives are ignored
              when computing the alternatives from which the user may select a directory to change to;

       o      <b>--block-size</b>=<u>nr</u> (<b>-b</b>)
              The possible directories matching <u>xd’s</u> argument  are  listed  in  blocks  of  <u>&lt;nr&gt;</u>  elements.  the
              possible  directories  matching  <u>xd’s</u> argument are listed in blocks of <u>&lt;nr&gt;</u> elements. The built-in
              minimum block size is 5. If there are fewer alternatives  then  this  built-in  minimum  then  the
              actually available alternatives are displayed;

              When  alternatives  are split up in blocks, a <u>+</u> is displayed after listing the first block, a <u>-</u> is
              displayed after listing the last block, and <u>-+</u> is displayed after listing the intermediate blocks.
              In these cases, pressing - redisplays the previous block, pressing + displays the next block;

              Although these block-end prompts only show - and +, the characters , and &lt;  (usually  combined  in
              one  key)  can  be used instead of -, while . and &gt; (also usually combined in one key) can be used
              instead of +.

       o      <b>--config-file</b>=<u>filename</u> (<b>-c</b>)
              The name of an <u>xd</u> configuration file. By default <u>xd</u> looks for the file <u>.xdrc</u> in  the  user’s  home
              directory. The existence of the default file is optional.

              This option cannot be specified in the configuration file;

       o      <b>--directories</b> <u>inclusion</u>
              Directories may be also be reached via symbolic links. The (default) inclusion type <u>all</u> adds these
              symbolic links to the list of alternatives. The inclusion type <u>unique</u> prevents symbolic links from
              being added to the list of alternatives;

       o      <b>--generalized-search</b> <b>-g</b>
              When  specified  <u>xd</u>  uses  GDS  unless the directive <u>traditional</u> is specified in the configuration
              file;

       o      <b>--help</b> (<b>-h</b>)
              Basic usage information is written to the standard error stream, whereafter <u>xd</u> terminates.

              This option cannot be specified in the configuration file;

       o      <b>--homedir-char</b> <u>ch</u>
              By default an initial dot character (`<u>.</u>’) initiates a search from the user’s home directory. There
              is a slight disadvantage to using the dot, as it is also be  the  initial  character  of  `hidden’
              directories.  Assuming  that  you have a directory <u><a href="file:~/.ssh">~/.ssh</a></u> then the command to xd to that directory
              would be <u>xd</u> <u>..s</u>, the first dot being the home directory indicator, after which <u>.s</u> is used to  find
              <u>.ssh</u>.  The  option  <u>--homedir-char</u>  can  be  used to specify another character. Homedir characters
              cannot be digits or a slash (`<u>/</u>’) as these are used to specify, respectively,  parent  directories
              and  the  computer’s  root  directory.  Characters like ``<u>,</u> <u>@</u> <u>%</u> <u>^</u>’’ or maybe `<u>H</u>’ (assuming that it
              doesn’t  interfere  with  an  existing  directory   beginning   with   <u>H</u>)   could   be   used   as
              homedir-characters, other than the default dot character.

              Caveat:  command  shells  by  default  interpret  characters  like ``<u>~</u> <u>$</u> <u>’</u> <u>"</u> <u>`</u> <u>&lt;</u> <u>&gt;</u> <u>|</u>’’ etc., which
              therefore should probably not be specified as home directory specifiers;

       o      <b>--history</b> <u>[filename]</u>
              A history of previously made choices is kept in the file <u>filename</u>. If <u>--history</u> is specified,  but
              the  filename  is  left  empty  the  history  file <u>$HOME/.xd.his</u> is used. This file should only be
              modified by <u>xd</u> itself. If you can’t resist editing it then use the following example  showing  the
              format of the lines in the history file.

                  1292596154 1 /home/frank/svn/xd/

              The  first  field is the time (in seconds since the epoch) the entry was written, the second field
              is the number of times the entry has been selected and the third field is the associated path.

              The following <u>history-...</u> options are only interpreted if the <u>history</u> option is also specified.

       o      <b>--history-lifetime</b> <u>spec</u>
              The lifetime of the entries in the history file. The specification consists of a  number  followed
              by <u>D,</u> <u>W,</u> <u>M</u> or <u>Y</u>, representing, resp. days, weeks, months, or years. A month is considered a period
              of  30  days,  a  year a period of 365 days. If the specification is omitted a lifetime of <u>1M</u> (one
              month) is used. Entries older than <u>history-lifetime</u>  are  disregarded  as  history-items  and  are
              removed from the history file;

       o      <b>--history-maxsize</b> <u>nr</u>
              The  maximum  number  of  entries the history file may contain. By default there is no limit. When
              <u>history-maxsize</u> is specified and more than the maximum number of history items are  found  in  the
              history  file  then  the  <u>nr</u>  most  popular  choices  are  kept. Usually the cut-off point will be
              somewhere within a popularity category. In that  case  the  most  recently  selected  alternatives
              within that category are kept;

       o      <b>--history-position</b> <u>[top|bottom]</u>
              Previously  found alternatives are displayed either at the top of the list or at the bottom of the
              list. If this option is omitted  then  the  elements  in  the  history  are  intermixed  with  new
              alternatives. The next option <u>history-separate</u> is only used when this option is also specified. By
              merely specifying <u>history-position</u> the history items are shown at the top of the list;

       o      <b>--history-separate</b>
              When  specified a blank line is written between the items in the history and new alternatives (not
              previously selected). This option is only interpreted when the previous option is also specified;

       o      <b>--icase</b> <b>-i</b>
              Specify this option to use case-insensitive pattern matching. E.g., specifying <u>xd</u> <u>/ub</u> returns  the
              directory  <u><a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a></u>,  but  not  a  directory like <u>/UnSpecified/Books</u>, which is returned by <u>xd</u> <u>/UB</u>.
              However, <u>xd</u> <u>-i</u> <u>/ub</u> (using any letter casing for the specification) returns both  directories.  The
              option  <u>icase</u>  could  of  course  be  specified  in  the  configuration  file,  which  which  case
              case-insensitive matching is used by default. In the latter case specifying <u>-i</u> as a  command  line
              option  reverts  the  matching procedure to case-sensitive directory matching. In general, when an
              even number of <u>icase</u> specifications is provided <u>xd</u> uses case-sensitive directory  matching,  while
              an odd number of <u>icase</u> specifications results in case-insensitive directory matching;

       o      <b>ignore</b> <u>path</u>
              This  option  cannot  be  specified  as  command-line  option. Instead, the configuration file may
              contain multiple <u>ignore</u> directives which are (different from the way other directives are handled)
              all interpreted. Each <u>ignore</u> directive is followed by a path specification as shown in a  list  of
              alternatives  produced  by <u>xd</u> or an initial substring of such a path terminating in a <u>*</u> character.
              When <u>xd</u> encounters a path matching any of the <u>ignore</u> directives (interpreting the final <u>*</u> as  `any
              further directory name’ specification) it will not display that path in its list of alternatives.

              This directive is overruled by the <u>---all</u> command line option;

       o      <b>--input</b>
              <u>Xd</u>  itself  issues  the  <u>cd</u> command for the selected directory to the shell, and enters other (non
              alternative-selecting characters) into the shell’s input.

              By specifying this option (or by entering <u>input</u> in the configuration file) an extra shell alias or
              script is not necessary. In this <u>input</u> mode <u>xd</u> directly inserts the requested <u>cd</u> command into  the
              shell’s  input  buffer.  This  mode  has  an  additional  feature: if a key is pressed that is not
              assiciated with a possible directory then  the  current  directory  is  kept,  and  the  character
              corresponding to the pressed key is entered into the shell’s input buffer. E.g., if <u>xd</u> <u>ulb</u> shows a
              list  of  five  alternatives,  but  the <u>L</u> key is pressed then <u>xd</u> ends and the shell’s input buffer
              shows <u>l</u>. Merely pressing <u>s</u> + Enter will then show the current directory content. To merely end  <u>xd</u>
              in this mode the space bar or Enter key can be pressed;

              To merely end <u>xd</u> press the Enter key or space-bar;

       o      <b>--no-input</b>
              The  <u>no-input</u>  option  can  only  be  specified  as a command-line option and suppresses the <u>input</u>
              option. The <u>no-input</u> option has no effect if the <u>input</u> option is not specified.

              By suppressing the <u>input</u> mode <u>xd</u> writes the name of the directory to change  to  to  its  standard
              output  stream. This allows shell functions to process the directory returned by <u>xd</u>. An example of
              its use is the function <u>pxd</u> (<u>pushd</u> using <u>xd</u>) shown in section <u>SHELL</u> <u>SCRIPTS</u>;

       o      <b>--start-at</b> <u>origin</u>
              Defines the default start location of directory searches. Origin <u>home</u> (the default) results in all
              default searches to start at the user’s home directory. Origin <u>root</u> results in searches  to  begin
              at the disk’s root (<u>/</u>) directory;

       o      <b>--traditional</b>
              <u>Xd</u>  does  not  use  GDS but uses its traditional mode. It overrules a <u>generalized-search</u> directive
              specified in the configuration file as well as the <u>-g</u> option;

       o      <b>--verbose</b> (<b>-V</b>)
              More extensive information about the actions taken by the <u>xd</u> program is written  to  the  standard
              error stream.

              This option cannot be specified in the configuration file;

       o      <b>--version</b> (<b>-v</b>)
              <u>Xd</u>’s version number is written to the standard error stream whereafter <u>xd</u> terminates.

              This option cannot be specified in the configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>CONFGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The  default  configuration  file  is  <u>.xdrc</u>  in  the  user’s  home directory. It may be overruled by the
       program’s <u>--config-file</u> command-line option.

       Empty lines are ignored. Information at and beyond <u>#</u>-characters is interpreted as  comment  and  is  also
       ignored.

       Directives in <u>xd</u> configuration files follow the pattern

           directive value

       (for some directives there is no <u>value</u> term).

       A  line  may at most contain one directive, but white space (including comment at the end of the line) is
       OK. The same directive may be specified multiple times, in which case the <u>last</u>  directive  will  be  used
       (except  for  the  <u>ignore</u>  directive,  which  are  all  interpreted). All directives are interpreted <u>case</u>
       <u>sensitively</u> unless option <u>icase</u> is specified.  Non-empty lines not beginning with a recognized  directive
       are silently ignored.

</pre><h4><b>SHELL</b> <b>SCRIPTS</b></h4><pre>
       Assuming  <u>xd</u>  is  installed in <u><a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a></u> scripts can be defined around <u>xd</u> for various shell programs. This
       allows the shell to change directories under control of <u>xd</u>.

       o      Example 1.

              To use <u>xd</u> in combination with the <u>pushd</u> shell command  <u>xd</u>  itself  should  not  perform  directory
              changes.  In  such  cases  the <u>no-input</u> option should be specified in the shell function combining
              <u>pushd</u> and <u>xd</u>.

              To use <u>xd</u> with the <b><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a></b>(1)-shell, the following function can be used (which  could  be  added  to,
              e.g., <u>.bash_login</u>):

                pxd()                   # function to do `pushd` using `xd`
                {
                    pushd "`/usr/bin/xd --no-input $*`"
                }

              To use <u>xd</u> with the <b><a href="../man1/tcsh.1.html">tcsh</a></b>(1)-shell, the following alias can be defined in, e.g., the <u><a href="file:~/.alias">~/.alias</a></u> file:

                alias  pxd  ’pushd `\xd --no-input \!*`’

       o      Example 2.

              If  the <u>input</u> option is specified (as command-line or configuration file option) then this example
              can be ignored.

              To use <u>xd</u> with the <b><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a></b>(1)-shell, the following function can be used (which  could  be  added  to,
              e.g., <u>.bash_login</u>):

                xd()                    # function to do `cd` using `xd`
                {
                    cd "`/usr/bin/xd $*`"
                }

              To use <u>xd</u> with the <b><a href="../man1/tcsh.1.html">tcsh</a></b>(1)-shell, the following alias can be defined in, e.g., the <u><a href="file:~/.alias">~/.alias</a></u> file:

                alias  xd  ’cd `\xd \!*`’

              Having  defined  the  <u>xd</u>  alias  or  script <u>xd</u> <u>...</u> commands results in the automatic (or optional)
              change of the current working directory

       If your system uses blanks in directory names, the above tcsh-alias cannot be  used  as  the  blanks  are
       interpreted as argument-separaters. In that case the following alias can be defined as the <u>xd</u> alias:

         alias  xd  ’setenv XD "`\xd \!*`";cd "$XD"’

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
           xd ulb      - all directories starting subsequently,
                         with u, l and b origin is default, or
                         specified in .xdrc as  home or root

           xd 0t       - all directories starting with t below the cwd

           xd 2t       - all directories starting at the `grandparent’
                         (2 steps up) of the cwd

           xd --start-at root t
                       - all directories at the root starting with t

           xd ..       - all directories starting with a dot in the cwd

           xd .        - the user’s home directory

           xd 0        - the current working directory

           xd 1        - the current directory’s parent directory

       Assuming the following directories exist:

         /usr/lib/bonobo
         /usr/lib/bonobo-activation
         <a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a>

       then  the  following  two  <u>ignore</u>  specifications  in <u>xd</u>’s configuration file will result in ignoring the
       <u>bonobo</u> directory alternatives:

       First specification:

         ignore /usr/lib/bonobo
         ignore /usr/lib/bonobo-activation

       Second specification:

         ignore /usr/lib/bonobo*

</pre><h4><b>ABOUT</b> <b>xd</b></h4><pre>
       The program <u>xd</u> was initially (before 1994) written for the MS-DOS platform. In 1994 it was redesigned  to
       work  under  Unix (Linux, AIX) and it was converted to <b>C++</b>. The original <b>C++</b> code is still available from
       tag <u>start</u> (<u>https://gitlab.com/fbb-git/xd/tags</u>, find the <u>start</u> tag and download) and is funny to  look  at
       as  it  is a remarkable illustration of <b>C++</b> code written by <b>C</b> programmers who had just learned about <b>C++</b>.
       Versions <u>2.x</u> were used until 2008, and in late August 2008 I rewrote <u>xd</u> completely,  reflecting  my  then
       views  about  <b>C++</b>,  eventually  resulting  in  versions  <u>3.x.y</u>  and  beyond. The <u>3.x.y</u> and later versions
       extensively use the facilities offered by the <b><a href="../man7/bobcat.7.html">bobcat</a></b>(7) library.

</pre><h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       GDS was added to <u>xd</u> following a suggestion by Bram Neijt (bram at neijt dot nl).
