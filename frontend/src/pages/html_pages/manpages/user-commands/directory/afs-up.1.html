</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       up - Recursively copy directories, preserving AFS metadata

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>up</b> [<b>-v</b>] [<b>-1</b>] [<b>-f</b>] [<b>-r</b>] [<b>-x</b>] [<b>-m</b>]
           &lt;<u>source</u> <u>directory</u>&gt; &lt;<u>destination</u> <u>directory</u>&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>up</b> command recursively copies the files and subdirectories in a specified source directory to a
       specified destination directory.  The command interpreter changes the destination directory and the files
       and subdirectories in it in the following ways:

       •   It  copies  the  source  directory's  access  control list (ACL) to the destination directory and its
           subdirectories, overwriting any existing ACLs.

       •   If the issuer is logged on as the local superuser root and has AFS tokens as a member  of  the  group
           system:administrators,  then  the  source  directory's  owner  (as  reported by the "ls -ld" command)
           becomes the owner of the destination directory and all files and subdirectories in it. Otherwise, the
           issuer's user name is recorded as the owner.

       •   If a file or directory exists in both the source and  destination  directories,  the  source  version
           overwrites  the  destination  version.  The overwrite operation fails if the first (user) "w" (write)
           mode bit is turned off on the version in the destination directory, unless the <b>-f</b> flag is provided.

       •   The modification timestamp on a file (as displayed by the "ls -l" command) in  the  source  directory
           overwrites  the  timestamp on a file of the same name in the destination directory, but the timestamp
           on an existing subdirectory in the destination directory remains unchanged. If the command creates  a
           new subdirectory in the destination directory, the new subdirectory's timestamp is set to the time of
           the copy operation, rather than to the timestamp that the subdirectory has in the source directory.

       The  up command is idempotent, meaning that if its execution is interrupted by a network, server machine,
       or process outage, then a subsequent reissue of the same command continues from the  interruption  point,
       rather  than starting over at the beginning. This saves time and reduces network traffic in comparison to
       the UNIX commands that provide similar functionality.

       The <b>up</b> command returns a status code of 0 (zero) only if it succeeds. Otherwise, it returns a status code
       of 1 (one).

       This command does not use the syntax conventions of the AFS command suites. Provide the command name  and
       all option names in full.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-v</b>  Prints a detailed trace to the standard output stream as the command runs.

       <b>-1</b>  Copies  only  the  files  in the top level source directory to the destination directory, rather than
           copying  recursively  through  subdirectories.  The  source  directory's  ACL  still  overwrites  the
           destination directory's. (This is the number one, not the letter "l".)

       <b>-f</b>  Overwrites  existing directories, subdirectories, and files even if the first (user) "w" (write) mode
           bit is turned off on the version in the destination directory.

       <b>-m</b>  Recognize and copy mount points  rather  than  traversing  the  volumes  they  reference  during  the
           recursive  copy  operation.  Without <b>-m</b>, <b>up</b>'s default behavior is to copy the contents of all volumes
           and subvolumes mounted under  the  source  directory  into  the  volume  containing  the  destination
           directory.

       <b>-r</b>  Creates  a  backup copy of all files overwritten in the destination directory and its subdirectories,
           by adding a ".old" extension to each filename.

       <b>-x</b>  Sets the modification timestamp on each file to the time of the copying operation.

       <u>source</u> <u>directory</u>
           Names the directory to copy recursively.

       <u>destination</u> <u>directory</u>
           Names the directory to which to copy. It does not have to exist already.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following command copies the contents of the directory <u>dir1</u> to directory <u>dir2</u>:

          % up dir1 dir2

</pre><h4><b>PRIVILEGE</b> <b>REQUIRED</b></h4><pre>
       The issuer must have the "a" (administer) permission on the  ACL  of  both  the  source  and  destination
       directories.
