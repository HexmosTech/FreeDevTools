       fs_mkmount - Creates a mount point for a volume

           [<b>-cell</b> &lt;<u>cell</u> <u>name</u>&gt;] [<b>-rw</b>] [<b>-fast</b>] [<b>-help</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>fs</b> <b>mkmount</b> command creates a mount point for the volume named by the <b>-vol</b> argument at the location in
       the AFS file space specified by the <b>-dir</b> argument. The mount point looks like a standard directory
       element, and serves as the volume's root directory, but is actually a special file system object that
       refers to an AFS volume. When the Cache Manager first encounters a given mount point during pathname
       traversal, it contacts the VL Server to learn which file server machines house the indicated volume, then
       fetches a copy of the volume's root directory from the appropriate file server machine.

       It is possible, although not recommended, to create more than one mount point to a volume. The Cache
       Manager can become confused if a volume is mounted in two places along the same path through the
       filespace.

       The Cache Manager observes three basic rules as it traverses the AFS filespace and encounters mount
       points:

       Rule 1: Access Backup and Read-only Volumes When Specified
           When  the Cache Manager encounters a mount point that specifies a volume with either a ".readonly" or
           a ".backup" extension, it accesses that type of volume only. If a mount point does not have either  a
           ".backup" or ".readonly" extension, the Cache Manager uses Rules 2 and 3.

           For  example,  the Cache Manager never accesses the read/write version of a volume if the mount point
           names the backup version. If the specified version is inaccessible,  the  Cache  Manager  reports  an
           error.

       Rule 2: Follow the Read-only Path When Possible
           If  a  mount point resides in a read-only volume and the volume that it references is replicated, the
           Cache Manager attempts to access a read-only copy of the volume; if  the  referenced  volume  is  not
           replicated,  the Cache Manager accesses the read/write copy. The Cache Manager is thus said to prefer
           a <u>read-only</u> <u>path</u> through the filespace, accessing read-only volumes when they are available.

           The Cache Manager starts on the read-only path in the first place because it always accesses a  read-
           only  copy  of  the  <b>root.afs</b>  volume if it exists; the volume is mounted at the root of a cell's AFS
           filespace (named <u>/afs</u> by convention). That is, if the "root.afs"  volume  is  replicated,  the  Cache
           Manager  attempts  to  access  a read-only copy of it rather than the read/write copy. This rule then
           keeps the Cache Manager on a read-only path as long as each  successive  volume  is  replicated.  The
           implication  is  that  both  the  "root.afs" and "root.cell" volumes must be replicated for the Cache
           Manager to access replicated volumes mounted below  them  in  the  AFS  filespace.  The  volumes  are
           conventionally mounted at the <u>/afs</u> and <u>/afs/cellname</u> directories, respectively.

       Rule 3: Once on a Read/write Path, Stay There
           If  a mount point resides in a read/write volume and the volume name does not have a ".readonly" or a
           ".backup" extension, the Cache Manager attempts to access only the read/write version of the  volume.
           The access attempt fails with an error if the read/write version is inaccessible, even if a read-only
           version  is  accessible.  In  this situation the Cache Manager is said to be on a <u>read/write</u> <u>path</u> and
           cannot switch back to the read-only path  unless  mount  point  explicitly  names  a  volume  with  a
           ".readonly"  extension.  (Cellular mount points are an important exception to this rule, as explained
           in the following discussion.

       There are three types of mount points, each appropriate for a different purpose because of the manner  in
       which the Cache Manager interprets them.

       •   When the Cache Manager crosses a <u>regular</u> mount point, it obeys all three of the mount point traversal
           rules  previously described. To create a regular mount point, include only the required <b>-dir</b> and <b>-vol</b>
           arguments to the <b>fs</b> <b>mkmount</b> command.

       •   When the Cache Manager crosses a <u>read/write</u> mount point,  it  attempts  to  access  only  the  volume
           version  named  in  the  mount  point.  If  the  volume name is the base (read/write) form, without a
           ".readonly" or ".backup" extension, the Cache Manager accesses the read/write version of the  volume,
           even  if  it  is  replicated.  In  other  words,  the Cache Manager disregards the second mount point
           traversal rule when crossing a read/write mount point: it switches to the read/write path through the
           filespace.

           To create a read/write mount  point,  include  the  <b>-rw</b>  flag  on  the  <b>fs</b>  <b>mkmount</b>  command.  It  is
           conventional  to  create only one read/write mount point in a cell's filespace, using it to mount the
           cell's "root.cell" volume just below the AFS filespace root (by convention, <u>/afs/.cellname</u>). See  the
           <u>OpenAFS</u>  <u>Quick</u>  <u>Start</u>  <u>Guide</u>  for instructions and the chapter about volume management in the <u>OpenAFS</u>
           <u>Administration</u> <u>Guide</u> for further discussion.

           Creating a read/write mount point for a read-only or backup volume is  acceptable,  but  unnecessary.
           The first rule of mount point traversal already specifies that the Cache Manager accesses them if the
           volume name in a regular mount point has a ".readonly" or ".backup" extension.

       •   When  the  Cache  Manager  crosses  a  <u>cellular</u>  mount point, it accesses the indicated volume in the
           specified cell, which is normally a foreign cell. (If the mount point does not name a cell along with
           the volume, the Cache Manager accesses the volume in the cell where the  mount  point  resides.)  The
           Cache  Manager disregards the third mount point traversal rule when crossing a regular cellular mount
           point: it accesses a read-only version of the volume if it is replicated, even  if  the  volume  that
           houses  the  mount  point  is  read/write. Switching to the read-only path in this way is designed to
           avoid imposing undue load on the file server machines in foreign cells.

           To create a regular cellular mount point, include the <b>-cell</b> argument on the <b>fs</b> <b>mkmount</b> command. It is
           conventional to create cellular mount points only at the second level in a  cell's  filespace,  using
           them  to  mount foreign cells' <b>root.cell</b> volumes just below the AFS filespace root (by convention, at
           <u>/afs/foreign_cellname</u>). The mount point enables local users to access the foreign  cell's  filespace,
           assuming they have the necessary permissions on the ACL of the volume's root directory and that there
           is  an entry for the foreign cell in each local client machine's <u>/etc/openafs/CellServDB</u> file. In the
           output of the <b>fs</b> <b>lsmount</b> command, the cell name and a colon (":") appear between the  initial  number
           sign and the volume name in a regular cellular mount point name.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-dir</b> &lt;<u>directory</u>&gt;+
           Names  the  directory  to  create  as  a  mount point. The directory must not already exist. Relative
           pathnames are interpreted with respect to the current working directory.

           Specify the read/write path to the directory, to avoid the failure that results  from  attempting  to
           create  a  new  mount point in a read-only volume. By convention, the read/write path is indicated by
           placing  a  period  before  the  cell  name  at   the   pathname's   second   level   (for   example,
           <u>/afs/.example.com</u>).  For  further discussion of the concept of read/write and read-only paths through
           the filespace, see "DESCRIPTION".

       <b>-vol</b> &lt;<u>volume</u> <u>name</u>&gt;
           Specifies the name or volume ID number of the volume to mount. If appropriate, add the ".readonly" or
           ".backup" extension to the name, or specify the appropriate volume ID number.

       <b>-cell</b> &lt;<u>cell</u> <u>name</u>&gt;
           Names the cell in which the volume resides (creates  a  cellular  mount  point).  Provide  the  fully
           qualified  domain  name, or a shortened form that disambiguates it from the other cells listed in the
           local <u>/etc/openafs/CellServDB</u> file.

           If this argument is omitted, no cell indicator appears in the mount point.  When  the  Cache  Manager
           interprets  it,  it  assumes that the volume named in the mount point resides in the same cell as the
           volume that houses the mount point.

       <b>-rw</b> Creates a read/write mount point. Omit this flag to create a regular mount point.

       <b>-fast</b>
           Prevents the Volume Location (VL) Server from checking that the volume has a VLDB entry and  printing
           a  warning  message if it does not. Whether or not this flag is included, the File Server creates the
           mount point even when the volume has no VLDB entry.

       <b>-help</b>
           Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  command  creates  a  regular  mount  point,   mounting   the   volume   "user.smith"   at
       <u>/afs/example.com/usr/smith</u>:

          % cd /afs/example.com/usr
          % fs mkmount -dir smith -vol user.smith

       The  following  commands  create  a  read/write  mount  point  and  a regular mount point for the Example
       Corporation cell's "root.cell" volume in that cell's file tree. The second command follows the convention
       of putting a period at the beginning of the read/write mount point's name.

          % fs mkmount -dir /afs/example.com -vol root.cell
          % fs mkmount -dir /afs/.example.com -vol root.cell -rw

       The following  command  mounts  the  Example  Organization  cell's  "root.cell"  volume  in  the  Example
       Corporation  cell's  file  tree,  creating a regular cellular mount point called <u>/afs/example.org</u>. When a
       Example Corporation Cache Manager encounters this mount point, it crosses into the  Example  Organization
       cell on a read-only path.

          % fs mkmount -dir /afs/example.org -vol root.cell -c example.org

</pre><h4><b>PRIVILEGE</b> <b>REQUIRED</b></h4><pre>
       The  issuer  must have the "i" (insert) and "a" (administer) permissions on the ACL of the directory that
       is to house the mount point.
