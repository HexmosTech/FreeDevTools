       manilist - report status of files in a source directory

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>manilist</b>  [  <b>-abcdhnptV</b>  ] [ <b>-i</b> <u>extension</u> ] [ <b>-f</b> <u>manifest</u> ] [ <b>-p</b> <u>format</u> ] [ <b>-s</b> <u>string</u> ] [ <b>-w</b> <u>which</u> ] [ <b>-x</b>
       <u>extension</u> ] [ <b>-C</b> <u>separator</u> ] [ <b>-I</b> <u>included</u> ] [ <b>-L</b> <u>colsize</u> ] [ <b>-X</b> <u>excluded</u> ] [ <u>files</u> <u>or</u> <u>directories</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Manilist</u> scans a source directory and produces a report on the status of each file: whether it is  up-to-
       date  or  not  with  respect  to <u>patchlevel.h</u> <u>,</u> if it is missing from MANIFEST.new, and some other useful
       information which may be dynamically configured. It can be use to maintain a MANIFEST.new file, produce a
       detailed listing and status of a group of directories, etc... The rich set  of  options  concur  to  make
       <u>manilist</u> a perfect low-level tool.

       Under  its  simplest invocation form at the top level directory of a package, with no arguments, <u>manilist</u>
       will scan the MANIFEST.new and produce a report on the status of each file listed there. Each line starts
       with a single character flag which indicates the state of the file, followed by the name of the file.

       What happens in fact is more complex than that. <u>Manilist</u> scans the MANIFEST.new file and then loops  over
       all  the  files  listed  there.  Internally,  <u>manilist</u> maintains an inclusion and an exclusion list, both
       specifying extensions for files. For instance, the inclusion list could be ('.c', '.h') and the exclusion
       ('.o', ',v') so that C sources are included and object or RCS files excluded. By default, all  files  but
       those  excluded are used.  Some other selections may be applied at this stage, as will be explained later
       on. For those files which pass this selection process, a report is issued according to a  report  <u>format</u>,
       which  by  default  is "<u>A:%c</u> <u>%n</u>".  The letter <u>A</u> (or anything before the initial ':' character is the file
       selection specification we've been talking about. The remaining is the  formatting,  a  string  which  is
       printed  as-is,  modulo some escape sequences.  It so happens that <u>%c</u> is the character flag and <u>%n</u> is the
       name of the current file.

       Generally speaking, <u>manilist</u> should be regarded as a tool which emits configurable reports on  a  set  of
       files,  selectively  picking  them among a list or by directly scanning the directories to see what's out
       there...

       By specifying a set of directories or files as arguments on the command line, you restrict  the  scanning
       area,  limiting  to  reports  concerning  those files or directories. If you do not specify any, manilist
       restricts its report to the current directory and its subdirectories, unless the <b>-t</b> option is given.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Manilist</u> recognizes the following options:

       <b>-a</b>             Make a report for <u>all</u> the files, regardless of what  is  specified  by  the  <u>included</u>  and
                      <u>excluded</u> suffix lists.

       <b>-b</b>             Assume  current  directory is the base (root) of the package tree. When this option is not
                      specified, <u>manilist</u> will look for a <u>.package</u> file to indicate the root  directory  of  the
                      package (also called the top) and complain if it does not find it.

       <b>-c</b>             Check  files  against  those listed in MANIFEST.new (or whatever file specified via the <b>-f</b>
                      option) and report discrepancies via the <u>%c</u> macro.

       <b>-d</b>             Dump included and excluded suffix lists on stderr, extensions  being  space  separated.  A
                      good way to know the default lists is to run: <u>manilist</u> <u>-f</u> <u>/dev/null</u> <u>-bd.</u>

       <b>-f</b> <u>manifest</u>    Specify an alternate manifest file, the default being to use MANIFEST.new.

       <b>-h</b>             Print the usage help message and exit.

       <b>-i</b> <u>extensions</u>  Add  new  extensions  to  the  included suffix list. The <u>extensions</u> argument must list the
                      suffixes separated by spaces, as in <b>-i</b> <u>'.ph</u> <u>.pl'</u> to add both <u>.ph</u> and <u>.pl</u> to  the  existing
                      suffixes.  Note  that  the  argument  needs  to  be quoted to protect spaces against shell
                      interpretation.

       <b>-n</b>             Do not use any manifest file. Rather scan the directories and act as with  all  the  files
                      there were already listed in a manifest.

       <b>-p</b> <u>format</u>      Set  the  new printing format, which has the form <u>selection</u>:<u>string</u>, with <u>selection</u> being a
                      list of single letters specifying which files  from  the  manifest  are  to  be  used  for
                      reports,  and <u>string</u> being a message to print as report, with some macro substitutions. It
                      is also possible to have column formatting by  specifying  a  '|'  inside  the  string  to
                      delimit  the  different  columns  you  wish to see. See also <b>-C</b> and <b>-L</b> for more formatting
                      parameters.

       <b>-s</b> <u>string</u>      Specify the <u>string</u> part of the printing format (see <b>-p</b> for a general  description  of  the
                      <u>format</u>). Available macros are listed further down the manual page.

       <b>-t</b>             Start  from  the  top directory (the root directory of the distribution) regardless of the
                      current directory. There must be a <u>.package</u> file to indicate what the top directory is.

       <b>-w</b> <u>selection</u>   Specifiy the <u>selection</u> part of the printing format. Available selections will be discussed
                      later.

       <b>-x</b> <u>extensions</u>  Add new extensions to the excluded suffix list. The  <u>extensions</u>  argument  must  list  the
                      suffixes separated by spaces, as in <b>-x</b> <u>'.s</u> <u>.p'</u> to add both <u>.s</u> and <u>.p</u> to the existing list.
                      Note that the argument needs to be quoted to protect spaces against shell interpretation.

       <b>-C</b> <u>separator</u>   Give the column separator, which is to be used in place of the '|' character in the report
                      format string. By default, it is a single space.

       <b>-I</b> <u>included</u>    Specify  a new list of suffixes to be included in the reports. This overrides the original
                      default list (whereas <b>-i</b> is used to <u>add</u> suffixes to the  list).  Suffixes  must  be  space
                      separated.

       <b>-L</b> <u>colsize</u>     When using column formatting (the '|' character being used to denote columns), this option
                      may  be  used  to specify the maximum column width, separating each width by a single ','.
                      Leaving a width unspecified does not impose any limit on its width. For instance,  if  the
                      format  string  is  <u>%n|%d|%t</u>,  one  could  limit  the  middle  column  (descriptions  from
                      MANIFEST.new) to 40 characters and the name column (first one) to 15  characters,  leaving
                      the last one with no imposed limits, by using <b>-L</b> <u>15,40,</u>.

       <b>-V</b>             Print version number and exit.

       <b>-X</b> <u>excluded</u>    Specify  a new list of suffixes to be excluded in the reports. This overrides the original
                      default list (whereas <b>-x</b> is used to <u>add</u> suffixes to the  list).  Suffixes  must  be  space
                      separated.

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       The  flexibility  of  <u>manilist</u>  is  brought  by  its use of a dynamic formatting string for providing its
       reports. It is possible to specify a format via the <b>-p</b> option or just parts of it: the text string via <b>-s</b>
       and the file selection with <b>-w</b>.

   <b>File</b> <b>Selection</b>
       The leading part of the formatting string tells <u>manilist</u> which files you wish to see in the final report.
       Available selectors are:

       <b>A</b>    All the files but the excluded ones (i.e. those files whose suffix is listed in the exclusion list).
            This is the default action.
       <b>a</b>    All the files included and/or excluded (shortcut for <u>ix</u>). Note that files which are neither included
            nor excluded will not appear in the report.
       <b>d</b>    Report only for directories.
       <b>f</b>    Report only for files.
       <b>i</b>    Only included files are listed.
       <b>m</b>    Only those files or directories found in the manifest are listed.
       <b>n</b>    Only those files or directories <u>not</u> found in the manifest are listed.
       <b>x</b>    Only excluded files are listed.

       When you specify more than one letter, the resulting report depends on the nature of the  selection.  For
       <u>d</u>, <u>f</u>, <u>m</u> and <u>n</u>, a logical union is performed. This means specifying <u>fd</u> or <u>mn</u> is the same as not specifying
       anything,  but  it's  less  efficient  since  <u>manilist</u> is forced to perform the checks it would otherwise
       bypass. The <u>i</u> and <u>x</u> selectors are  special:  by  default,  all  the  files  not  excluded  are  reported.
       Specifying <u>x</u> also asks for excluded files. Specifying <u>i</u> restricts the report to the included files. Using
       both at the same time (<u>ix</u>) will force a report for files which are included or excluded.

   <b>Macro</b> <b>Substitution</b>
       The string part of the report format can make use of the following macros:

       %c   A character coding the status of the file.
       %d   Description from the manifest file, if any.
       %n   Name of the file (its path from the top directory).
       %s   Size of the file, in bytes.
       %t   Time stamp of the last modification.

   <b>File</b> <b>Status</b>
       The <u>%c</u> macro, giving a single character coding the file status, can expand into one of the following.
       .    The file is up to date (not newer than <u>patchlevel.h</u>).
       -    The file is present in the manifest but is missing.
       &gt;    The file has been modified since last patch (newer than <u>patchlevel.h</u>).
       +    The file exists but is not listed in the manifest.
       o    The file exists but is not listed in the manifest and is older than <u>patchlevel.h</u>
       x    The file is listed in the manifest and exists, but has been excluded. Naturally, this will appear in
            the report only if the <u>x</u> selector is given in the report format.
       ?    The file is listed in the manifest, does not exist, and was excluded.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The command

            <u>manilist</u> <u>-ct</u> <u>-p</u> <u>'ni:%n'</u>

       will  list  all  the  source files from your distribution which are not listed in your MANIFEST.new file.
       Note that this includes only "source" files, that is to say  files  whose  extension  is  listed  in  the
       inclusion  list.   If you do not wish this restriction, replace the formatting string with <u>n:%n</u> (only the
       excluded files will not appear).

       To build an initial MANIFEST file, use:

            <u>manilist</u> <u>-n</u> <u>-p</u> <u>'Af:%n'</u> <u>&gt;</u> <u>MANIFEST</u>

       from the top directory. You will eventually want to fill in descriptions for  each  file  listed  in  the
       manifest.
