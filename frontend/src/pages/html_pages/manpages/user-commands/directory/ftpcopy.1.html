</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ftpcopy - create and maintain a ftp mirror.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       ftpcopy [options] host[:port] remotedir [localdir]
          or: ftpcopy [options] <a href="ftp://host">ftp://host</a>[:port]/remotedir [localdir]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       ftpcopy  copies  a FTP site recursivly. It afterwards deletes all files in the local directory tree which
       were not found on the remote site.

       local-directory defaults to `.' - the current working directory - if  the  --no-delete  option  is  used.
       local-directory  is  not needed if the --interactive option is used.  Otherwise you must provide a local-
       directory argument.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Connect</b> <b>/</b> <b>login</b> <b>/</b> <b>username</b> <b>/</b> <b>password</b> <b>options:</b>
       -u, --user=NAME
              Use <u>NAME</u> to login on the ftp server.
              The default is `anonymous'. Use an empty name to force the program to not log in.

       -p, --pass=PASSWORD
              Use PASS as password to login on the ftp server.
              The default is `<a href="mailto:anonymous@invalid.example">anonymous@invalid.example</a>'. If an empty password is given the  programm  will  not
              send a password to the server.

       --account=ACCOUNT
              Send <u>ACCOUNT</u> as account name during login phase.
              Note:  this  is _not_ the user name, but the name of what could be called a subaccount implemented
              by a few servers. If you don't understand what it means you have a good chance to never need  this
              option anyway. If you think you need it please try the --user option first.

       --tries=ARG
              Number of tries to connect and log in.
              The default is 1, meaning that the program will give up after the first error.
              This option was added in version 0.3.0.

       --data-connect-retries=ARG
              Number of tries to connect to data port.
              The  program  will  try to reach the data port (for retrieval of listings or data) that many times
              and will give up after that many errors in a row. The default is 5, meaning that the program  will
              give up after the fifth error.
              This option was added in version 0.6.6. The old behaviour was to give up after the first error.

       --login-sleep=ARG
              Seconds to sleep after a failed login.
              More  precisely:  the  program  will fall to sleep for this many seconds after a try to connect or
              login has failed. The default is 5. A 0 is treated as  1,  and  abuse,  especially  together  with
              --tries, is likely to annory the servers adminstrators.
              This option was added in version 0.4.5.

       -4, --v4
              Only use IPv4, even if v6 is available.
              This option effectively disallows the use of IPv6, except for DNS queries.
              It was added in version 0.6.0.

       -6, --v6
              Only use IPv6, even if v4 is available.
              This option effectively disallows the use of IPv4, except for DNS queries.
              It was added in version 0.6.0.

   <b>Verbosity</b> <b>options:</b>
       -l, --loglevel=ARG
              Controls the amount of logging done.
                0: nothing except warnings and error messages.
                1: downloads and deletes (this is the default).
                2: links/symlinks created, files we already got.
                3: useless stuff.

       --bps  Log transfer rates.
              This  option  causes  ftpcopy  to  log  byte  /  kilobyte  / megabyte per second information after
              successful transfers.
              This option was added in version 0.3.9.

       --progress
              Report progress to stderr.
              This will print a report of the download every second: a short form of the file  name,  the  bytes
              got and expected and the percentage received.
              This option was added in version 0.6.0.

   <b>File</b> <b>selection</b> <b>options:</b>
       -m, --max-days=DAYS
              Download only files modified in the last <u>DAYS</u>.
              Locally  existing  copies of the not downloaded files will be kept. The default is not to restrict
              the age of files.

       --max-size=MAXBYTES
              Download only files up to <u>MAXBYTES</u> length.
              Locally existing copies of overlong files will be deleted during the clean-up step. The default is
              not to restrict the file size.
              This option was added in version 0.5.1.

       -x, --exclude=WILDCARD
              Exclude paths matching <u>WILDCARD</u>.
              If <u>WILDCARD</u> matches the full path of the remote  file  then  the  file  will  not  be  downloaded.
              <u>WILDCARD</u>  is  a  shell style wildcard expression, not a regular expression like those of grep. You
              can repeat this option as often as you want, and you can intermix it with the --include option.
              If both includes and excludes are used then the last matching one will be honored. The list starts
              with an implicit '--include *'.
              If the --tolower option is used together with --exclude or --include then the in/exclude  patterns
              have to be written in lower case.
              This option was added in version 0.3.0.

       -i, --include=WILDCARD
              Include paths matching <u>WILDCARD</u>.
              This is the opposite of the --exclude option.
              It was added in version 0.3.0.

       -X, --in-exclude-file=FILE
              Read in/exclude patterns from <u>FILE</u>.
              The  include  and exclude patterns are read from a file. If the first character of a line is a '+'
              the remainder of the line is treated as an argument of a --include optiona and if it is a  '-'  it
              is treated as an argument to a --exclude option. Lines starting with a '#' are ignored.
              <u>FILE</u>  will  be  read after any --include and --exclude options given on the command line have been
              read.
              This option was added in version 0.6.6.

       --ignore-size
              Ignore file size.
              Do not compare file sizes when checking the remote file has to be downloaded.
              This option was added in version 0.4.4.

       --ignore-time
              Ignore modification times.
              Do not compare file modification times when checking the remote file has to  be  downloaded.  This
              option  may  be  combined  with  --ignore-size,  in  which  case  a  file will never be downloaded
              regardless of changes in file size or modification time. In other words: ftpcopy will not download
              any updates.
              This option was added in version 0.4.4.

       --max-depth=ARG
              Descend at most LEVEL directories.
                0 means `do not enter sub directories at all',
                1 means `enter sub-directories, but not their sub-directories'.
              The default is 2^32-1 meaning `enter all'.

   <b>Deletion</b> <b>options:</b>
       -n, --no-delete
              Do not delete files.
              This influences the cleanup step when getting rid of things the server doesn't  have  anymore.  It
              does not stop ftpcopy from deleting files when it detects something in it's way during a download.

       -M, --max-deletes=COUNT
              Do not delete more then <u>COUNT</u> files.
              This option may be useful to limit the impact of a tempoary loss of files on the server. This only
              influences  the  cleanup  step  and  does  not  stop  ftpcopy to delete files in it's way during a
              download. The default is 0, meaning unlimited.
              This option was added in version 0.4.5.

   <b>Operational</b> <b>options:</b>
       -d, --directories-only
              Only create the directory hierarchie.
              Do not download files. Any file in the tree will be deleted unless the -n option is also given.
              This option will be removed in future versions, unless someone objects.

       --dry-run
              Don't do anything.
              ftpcopy will only show what would be done.
              This option was added in version 0.3.6.

       -T, --timeout=SECONDS
              Timeout to use for network read/write.
              The default is 30 seconds and is usually sufficient.
              This option was added in version 0.3.8.

       --rate-limit=BYTES_PER_SECOND
              Limit file download speed.
              Limit the transfer rate of file downloads to about that many bytes per seconds. The implementation
              is crude and simple, by sleeping up to one second between network reads, and  therefore  does  not
              even  try  to  limit  the  rate  exactly to that number. On the other hand it usually works and is
              unlikely to break things by causing timeouts.
              The default is unlimited.
              This option was added in version 0.4.7.

       --interactive
              Read directories from stdin.
              This option tells ftpcopy to ignore any directories  given  on  the  command  line,  and  to  read
              commands  from the standard input. Each command consists of two lines, the first being a directory
              on the remote server, and the second a local directory. ftpcopy will  print  an  END-OF-COPY  line
              after each operation.
              This  option  was  added  in  version 0.3.6 and will be removed in future versions, unless someone
              objects.

   <b>Workaround</b> <b>options:</b>
       --ascii-listings
              Do directory listings in ASCII mode.
              Use this option if the FTP server is unable to correctly list  directories  in  binary  mode,  for
              example, if you see a message like this (usually on one line):
              `fatal: received unwanted answer to LIST: 426 Data connection: Illegal seek.'
              This option was added in version 0.5.2.

       -L, --list-options=OPTS
              Add <u>OPTS</u> to LIST command.
              This  allows to pass arbitrary options to the FTP servers LIST command. Note that ftpcopy does not
              cope well with recursive directory listings.
              This option was added in version 0.3.0.

       -s, --symlink-hack
              Deal with symbolic links.
              This is only useful to mirror sites which create listings through <a href="file:/bin/ls">/bin/ls</a>, and will fail if a file
              name in a link contains a ` -&gt; ' sequence.

       --force-select
              Use select, not poll.
              Do not use the poll() system call even if it's available, but use select()  instead.  This  allows
              the program to be used together with runsocks from the socks5 reference implementation.
              Please  note that you will need a directly reachable name server anyway, as the DNS library in use
              does not support SOCKS (you can always use IP addresses).
              This option was added in version 0.3.8.

       --mdtm Use the MDTM command to get the remote time.
              The default is to take the times from the directory listings. This  doesn't  work  if  the  server
              implements  an  inferior  listing  format  (most  do)  and  doesn't  send time stamps in universal
              coordinated time (UTC). The damage caused by this is limited to file time stamps being wrong by  a
              few hours.
              This option makes ftpcopy send a MDTM command for any file it might want to download. The drawback
              is that this eats performance: ftpcopy usually sends just one command for a complete directory its
              traverses. With the --mdtm option it has to send an additional command for any file.
              This option was added in version 0.3.10.

       --allow-pasv-ip=IP4
              Allow data connections to the address <u>IP4</u>.
              Normally  ftpls  only accepts data connections to the IP addresses it received as an answer to the
              DNS request, or the IP address in the URL. Sometimes this is not enough, especially  when  NAT  or
              masquerading  are  active.  ftpcopy then prints an error message `illegal redirect by FTP server'.
              With this option, which may be given more than once, you  can  add  additional  addresses  to  the
              internal  list of allowed data connection targets. <u>IP4</u> has to be an IPv4 address or a list of IPv4
              addresses, separated by commas.
              The environment variable FTPCOPY_ALLOW_PASV_IP serves the same purpose.
              Note: Do not use this option without thinking: FTP redirects may  be  used  to  launch  denial  of
              service attacks against innocent targets.
              This option was added in version 0.6.1.

       --no-resume
              Do not try to resume downloads.
              The REST command, needed to resume a failed
              download,  is badly specified and likely to be misinterpreted and -implemented. Use this option in
              case of trouble.
              This option was added in version 0.6.0.

       --tolower
              Change all local file names to lowercase.
              Use this only if you are absolutely sure that the remote  side  does  not  contain  any  files  or
              directories  whose  lower  cased  names  collide with each other. Otherwise this option will waste
              bandwidth.
              If this option is used together with the  --exclude  or  --include  options  then  the  in/exclude
              patterns have to be written in lower case.
              This option was added in version 0.3.8.

   <b>Help</b> <b>options:</b>
       --include-exclude-help
              How --include and --exclude work.

       --examples
              Show usage examples.

       --see-also
              Where to find related information.

       --version
              Show version: ftpcopy (ftpcopy) 0.6.7.

       --help Show a list of options or the long help on one.
              The use with an argument shows the long help text
              of that option, without an argument it will list
              all options.

       --longhelp
              Show longer help texts for all or one option.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       mirror cr.yp.to:
         ftpcopy  \
         --exclude '*.cdb'  \
         --exclude '*software/precompiled*' \
         cr.yp.to / /private/file/0/mirror/cr.yp.to
       This means:
         * i'm not interested in .cdb files.
         * precompiled stuff is also not downloaded.
         * the host to connect to is cr.yp.to.
         * the remote directory is /, and
         * and /private/file/0/mirror/cr.yp.to is the local directory.

</pre><h4><b>IN/EXCLUDE</b></h4><pre>
       In- and exclude lists are internally mixed together, keeping the order in which they were given. The list
       starts with an implicit `include *'. ftpcopy honors the last match.

       The  wildcard matching is done against the full remote path of the file. The `/' character has no special
       meaning for the matching and is treated like any other.

       Note: you have to include top level directories of files or directories you want  to  include.  Something
       like this will NOT work:
           --exclude '*' --include '/w/h/e/r/e/file.c'
       You need to include /w, /w/h and so on.
