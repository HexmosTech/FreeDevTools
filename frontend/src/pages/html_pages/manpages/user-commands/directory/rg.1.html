</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       ripgrep  (rg)  recursively  searches the current directory for a regex pattern.  By default, ripgrep will
       respect your <b>.gitignore</b> and automatically skip hidden files/directories and binary files.

       ripgrep's default regex engine uses finite automata and guarantees  linear  time  searching.  Because  of
       this,  features  like  backreferences and arbitrary look-around are not supported. However, if ripgrep is
       built with PCRE2, then the <b>-P/--pcre2</b> flag can be used to enable backreferences and look-around.

       ripgrep supports configuration files. Set <b>RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH</b> to  a  configuration  file.  The  file  can
       specify  one  shell  argument  per  line.  Lines  starting  with  <b>#</b>  are  ignored.  For more details, see
       <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILES</b> below.

       ripgrep will automatically detect if stdin exists and search stdin for a regex pattern, e.g. <b>ls</b> <b>|</b> <b>rg</b> <b>foo</b>.
       In some environments, stdin may exist when it shouldn't. To turn off stdin detection, one can  explicitly
       specify the directory to search, e.g. <b>rg</b> <b>foo</b> <b>./</b>.

       Like  other tools such as <b>ls</b>, ripgrep will alter its output depending on whether stdout is connected to a
       tty. By default, when printing a tty, ripgrep will enable colors, line numbers and a heading format  that
       lists each matching file path once instead of once per matching line.

       Tip: to disable all smart filtering and make ripgrep behave a bit more like classical grep, use <b>rg</b> <b>-uuu</b>.

</pre><h4><b>REGEX</b> <b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       ripgrep     uses     Rust's     regex    engine    by    default,    which    documents    its    syntax:
       <u>https://docs.rs/regex/1.*/regex/#syntax</u>

       ripgrep    uses    byte-oriented    regexes,     which     has     some     additional     documentation:
       <u>https://docs.rs/regex/1.*/regex/bytes/index.html#syntax</u>

       To  a  first  approximation,  ripgrep  uses Perl-like regexes without look-around or backreferences. This
       makes them very similar to the "extended" (ERE) regular expressions supported by *egrep*, but with a  few
       additional features like Unicode character classes.

       If  you're  using ripgrep with the <b>-P/--pcre2</b> flag, then please consult <u>https://www.pcre.org</u> or the PCRE2
       man pages for documentation on the supported syntax.

</pre><h4><b>POSITIONAL</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>PATTERN</u>     A regular expression used for searching. To match a pattern beginning with a  dash,  use  the
                   <b>-e/--regexp</b> option.

       <u>PATH</u>        A  file  or  directory  to search. Directories are searched recursively. File paths specified
                   explicitly on the command line override glob and ignore rules.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This section documents all flags that ripgrep accepts. Flags are grouped into categories below  according
       to their function.

       Note  that  many  options  can be turned on and off. In some cases, those flags are not listed explicitly
       below. For example, the <b>--column</b> flag (listed below) enables column numbers in ripgrep's output, but  the
       <b>--no-column</b>  flag  (not  listed  below)  disables  them.  The  reverse  can  also exist. For example, the
       <b>--no-ignore</b> flag (listed below) disables ripgrep's <b>gitignore</b> logic, but the  <b>--ignore</b>  flag  (not  listed
       below)  enables  it. These flags are useful for overriding a ripgrep configuration file (or alias) on the
       command line. Each flag's documentation notes whether an inverted flag exists.  In all  cases,  the  flag
       specified last takes precedence.

   <b>INPUT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-e</b> <u>PATTERN</u>, <b>--regexp</b>=<u>PATTERN</u>
           A  pattern  to  search  for. This option can be provided multiple times, where all patterns given are
           searched, in addition to any patterns provided by <b>-f/--file</b>. Lines  matching  at  least  one  of  the
           provided  patterns  are  printed.   This flag can also be used when searching for patterns that start
           with a dash.

           For example, to search for the literal <b>-foo</b>:

               rg -e -foo

           You can also use the special <b>--</b> delimiter to indicate that no more flags will  be  provided.  Namely,
           the following is equivalent to the above:

               rg -- -foo

           When  <b>-f/--file</b>  or  <b>-e/--regexp</b>  is  used,  then ripgrep treats all positional arguments as files or
           directories to search.

       <b>-f</b> <u>PATTERNFILE</u>, <b>--file</b>=<u>PATTERNFILE</u>
           Search for patterns from the given file, with one pattern per line. When this flag is  used  multiple
           times  or  in  combination  with the <b>-e/--regexp</b> flag, then all patterns provided are searched. Empty
           pattern lines will match all input lines, and the newline is not counted as part of the pattern.

           A line is printed if and only if it matches at least one of the patterns.

           When <u>PATTERNFILE</u> is <b>-</b>, then <b>stdin</b> will be read for the patterns.

           When <b>-f/--file</b> or <b>-e/--regexp</b> is used, then ripgrep treats  all  positional  arguments  as  files  or
           directories to search.

       <b>--pre</b>=<u>COMMAND</u>
           For  each  input <u>PATH</u>, this flag causes ripgrep to search the standard output of <u>COMMAND</u> <u>PATH</u> instead
           of the contents of <u>PATH</u>.  This option expects the <u>COMMAND</u> program to  either  be  a  path  or  to  be
           available  in  your  <b>PATH</b>.  Either  an  empty  string  <u>COMMAND</u> or the <b>--no-pre</b> flag will disable this
           behavior.

           <b>WARNING</b>     When this flag is set, ripgrep will unconditionally spawn a process for every  file  that
                       is  searched. Therefore, this can incur an unnecessarily large performance penalty if you
                       don't otherwise need the flexibility offered by this flag.  One  possible  mitigation  to
                       this is to use the <b>--pre-glob</b> flag to limit which files a preprocessor is run with.

           A preprocessor is not run when ripgrep is searching stdin.

           When  searching over sets of files that may require one of several preprocessors, <u>COMMAND</u> should be a
           wrapper program which first classifies <u>PATH</u> based on magic numbers/content or based on the <u>PATH</u>  name
           and  then  dispatches  to  an  appropriate  preprocessor.  Each  <u>COMMAND</u>  also has its standard input
           connected to <u>PATH</u> for convenience.

           For example, a shell script for <u>COMMAND</u> might look like:

               case "$1" in
               *.pdf)
                   exec pdftotext "$1" -
                   ;;
               *)
                   case $(file "$1") in
                   *Zstandard*)
                       exec pzstd -cdq
                       ;;
                   *)
                       exec cat
                       ;;
                   esac
                   ;;
               esac

           The above script uses <b>pdftotext</b> to convert a PDF file to plain text. For all other files, the  script
           uses the <b>file</b> utility to sniff the type of the file based on its contents. If it is a compressed file
           in the Zstandard format, then <b>pzstd</b> is used to decompress the contents to stdout.

           This overrides the <b>-z/--search-zip</b> flag.

       <b>--pre-glob</b>=<u>GLOB</u>
           This  flag  works  in  conjunction with the <b>--pre</b> flag. Namely, when one or more <b>--pre-glob</b> flags are
           given, then only files that match the given set of globs will be handed to the command  specified  by
           the <b>--pre</b> flag. Any non-matching files will be searched without using the preprocessor command.

           This  flag  is useful when searching many files with the <b>--pre</b> flag.  Namely, it provides the ability
           to avoid process overhead for files that don't need preprocessing. For example, given  the  following
           shell script, <u>pre-pdftotext</u>:

               #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
               pdftotext "$1" -

           then  it is possible to use <b>--pre</b> <u>pre-pdftotext</u> <b>--pre-glob</b> <u>pre-pdftotext</u> command on files with a <u>.pdf</u>
           extension.

           Multiple <b>--pre-glob</b> flags may be used. Globbing rules match <b>gitignore</b> globs. Precede a glob with a  <b>!</b>
           to exclude it.

           This flag has no effect if the <b>--pre</b> flag is not used.

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--search-zip</b>
           This  flag  instructs  ripgrep  to  search in compressed files. Currently gzip, bzip2, xz, LZ4, LZMA,
           Brotli and Zstd files are supported. This option expects the decompression binaries (such as <b>gzip</b>) to
           be available in your <b>PATH</b>. If the required binaries are not found, then  ripgrep  will  not  emit  an
           error messages by default. Use the <b>--debug</b> flag to see more information.

           Note  that  this  flag does not make ripgrep search archive formats as directory trees. It only makes
           ripgrep detect compressed files and then decompress them before searching their contents as it  would
           any other file.

           This overrides the <b>--pre</b> flag.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--no-search-zip</b>.

   <b>SEARCH</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-s</b>, <b>--case-sensitive</b>
           Execute the search case sensitively. This is the default mode.

           This is a global option that applies to all patterns given to ripgrep.  Individual patterns can still
           be  matched  case insensitively by using inline regex flags. For example, <b>(?i)abc</b> will match <b>abc</b> case
           insensitively even when this flag is used.

           This flag overrides the <b>-i/--ignore-case</b> and <b>-S/--smart-case</b> flags.

       <b>--crlf</b>
           When enabled, ripgrep will treat CRLF (<b>\r\n</b>) as a line terminator instead of just <b>\n</b>.

           Principally, this permits the line anchor assertions <b>^</b> and <b>$</b> in regex patterns to treat CRLF,  CR  or
           LF  as  line  terminators instead of just LF.  Note that they will never match between a CR and a LF.
           CRLF is treated as one single line terminator.

           When using the default regex engine, CRLF support can also be enabled inside the pattern with  the  <b>R</b>
           flag. For example, <b>(?R:$)</b> will match just before either CR or LF, but never between CR and LF.

           This flag overrides <b>--null-data</b>.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--no-crlf</b>.

       <b>--dfa-size-limit</b>=<u>NUM+SUFFIX?</u>
           The upper size limit of the regex DFA. The default limit is something generous for any single pattern
           or  for  many  smallish  patterns.  This  should only be changed on very large regex inputs where the
           (slower) fallback regex engine may otherwise be used if the limit is reached.

           The input format accepts suffixes of  <b>K</b>,  <b>M</b>  or  <b>G</b>  which  correspond  to  kilobytes,  megabytes  and
           gigabytes, respectively. If no suffix is provided the input is treated as bytes.

       <b>-E</b> <u>ENCODING</u>, <b>--encoding</b>=<u>ENCODING</u>
           Specify  the  text  encoding  that ripgrep will use on all files searched. The default value is <b>auto</b>,
           which will cause ripgrep to do a best effort automatic detection of encoding  on  a  per-file  basis.
           Automatic  detection  in this case only applies to files that begin with a UTF-8 or UTF-16 byte-order
           mark (BOM). No other automatic detection is performed. One can also  specify  <b>none</b>  which  will  then
           completely disable BOM sniffing and always result in searching the raw bytes, including a BOM if it's
           present, regardless of its encoding.

           Other     supported     values     can     be     found    in    the    list    of    labels    here:
           <u>https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-encoding-get</u>.

           For more details on encoding and how ripgrep deals with it, see <b>GUIDE.md</b>.

           The encoding detection that ripgrep uses can be reverted to its automatic mode via the  <b>--no-encoding</b>
           flag.

       <b>--engine</b>=<u>ENGINE</u>
           Specify  which  regular  expression  engine  to  use. When you choose a regex engine, it applies that
           choice for every regex provided to ripgrep (e.g., via multiple <b>-e/--regexp</b> or <b>-f/--file</b> flags).

           Accepted values are <b>default</b>, <b>pcre2</b>, or <b>auto</b>.

           The default value is <b>default</b>, which is usually the fastest and should be good for most use cases. The
           <b>pcre2</b> engine is generally useful when you want to use features such as look-around or backreferences.
           <b>auto</b> will dynamically choose between supported regex engines depending on  the  features  used  in  a
           pattern on a best effort basis.

           Note  that the <b>pcre2</b> engine is an optional ripgrep feature. If PCRE2 wasn't included in your build of
           ripgrep, then using this flag will result in ripgrep printing an error message and exiting.

           This overrides previous uses of the <b>-P/--pcre2</b> and <b>--auto-hybrid-regex</b> flags.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--fixed-strings</b>
           Treat all patterns as literals instead of as regular expressions. When this  flag  is  used,  special
           regular expression meta characters such as <b>.(){}*+</b> should not need be escaped.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--no-fixed-strings</b>.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--ignore-case</b>
           When this flag is provided, all patterns will be searched case insensitively.  The case insensitivity
           rules used by ripgrep's default regex engine conform to Unicode's "simple" case folding rules.

           This is a global option that applies to all patterns given to ripgrep.  Individual patterns can still
           be  matched  case  sensitively by using inline regex flags. For example, <b>(?-i)abc</b> will match <b>abc</b> case
           sensitively even when this flag is used.

           This flag overrides <b>-s/--case-sensitive</b> and <b>-S/--smart-case</b>.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--invert-match</b>
           This flag inverts matching. That is, instead of printing lines that match, ripgrep will  print  lines
           that don't match.

           Note  that this only inverts line-by-line matching. For example, combining this flag with <b>-l/--files-</b>
           <b>with-matches</b> will emit files that contain any lines that do not match the patterns given. That's  not
           the  same  as,  for  example,  <b>--files-without-match</b>,  which  will emit files that do not contain any
           matching lines.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--no-invert-match</b>.

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--line-regexp</b>
           When enabled, ripgrep will only show matches surrounded by line boundaries.  This  is  equivalent  to
           surrounding  every pattern with <b>^</b> and <b>$</b>. In other words, this only prints lines where the entire line
           participates in a match.

           This overrides the <b>-w/--word-regexp</b> flag.

       <b>-m</b> <u>NUM</u>, <b>--max-count</b>=<u>NUM</u>
           Limit the number of matching lines per file searched to <u>NUM</u>.

           Note that <b>0</b> is a legal value but not likely to be useful. When used, ripgrep won't search anything.

       <b>--mmap</b>
           When enabled, ripgrep will search using memory maps when possible. This is enabled  by  default  when
           ripgrep thinks it will be faster.

           Memory  map  searching cannot be used in all circumstances. For example, when searching virtual files
           or streams likes <b>stdin</b>. In such cases, memory maps will not be used even when this flag is enabled.

           Note that ripgrep may abort unexpectedly when memory maps are used if it  searches  a  file  that  is
           simultaneously truncated. Users can opt out of this possibility by disabling memory maps.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--no-mmap</b>.

       <b>-U</b>, <b>--multiline</b>
           This flag enable searching across multiple lines.

           When  multiline mode is enabled, ripgrep will lift the restriction that a match cannot include a line
           terminator. For example, when multiline mode is not enabled (the default),  then  the  regex  <b>\p{any}</b>
           will  match any Unicode codepoint other than <b>\n</b>. Similarly, the regex <b>\n</b> is explicitly forbidden, and
           if you try to use it, ripgrep will return an error.  However, when multiline mode is enabled, <b>\p{any}</b>
           will match any Unicode codepoint, including <b>\n</b>, and regexes like <b>\n</b> are permitted.

           An important caveat is that multiline mode does not change the match semantics of <b>.</b>. Namely, in  most
           regex matchers, a <b>.</b> will by default match any character other than <b>\n</b>, and this is true in ripgrep as
           well.  In order to make <b>.</b> match <b>\n</b>, you must enable the "dot all" flag inside the regex. For example,
           both <b>(?s).</b> and <b>(?s:.)</b> have the same semantics, where  <b>.</b>  will  match  any  character,  including  <b>\n</b>.
           Alternatively,  the <b>--multiline-dotall</b> flag may be passed to make the "dot all" behavior the default.
           This flag only applies when multiline search is enabled.

           There is no limit on the number of the lines that a single match can span.

           <b>WARNING</b>: Because of how the underlying regex engine works, multiline  searches  may  be  slower  than
           normal  line-oriented searches, and they may also use more memory. In particular, when multiline mode
           is enabled, ripgrep requires that each file it searches is laid out contiguously in memory (either by
           reading it onto the heap or by memory-mapping it). Things  that  cannot  be  memory-mapped  (such  as
           <b>stdin</b>)  will be consumed until EOF before searching can begin. In general, ripgrep will only do these
           things when necessary.  Specifically, if the <b>-U/--multiline</b> flag is provided but the regex  does  not
           contain  patterns  that would match <b>\n</b> characters, then ripgrep will automatically avoid reading each
           file into memory before searching it.  Nevertheless, if you only care about matches spanning at  most
           one line, then it is always better to disable multiline mode.

           This overrides the <b>--stop-on-nonmatch</b> flag.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--no-multiline</b>.

       <b>--multiline-dotall</b>
           This  flag enables "dot all" mode in all regex patterns. This causes <b>.</b> to match line terminators when
           multiline searching is enabled. This flag has no effect if multiline searching isn't enabled with the
           <b>-U/--multiline</b> flag.

           Normally, a <b>.</b> will match any character except line terminators. While this behavior  typically  isn't
           relevant  for  line-oriented  matching  (since matches can span at most one line), this can be useful
           when searching with the <b>-U/--multiline</b> flag. By default, multiline mode runs without "dot  all"  mode
           enabled.

           This flag is generally intended to be used in an alias or your ripgrep config file if you prefer "dot
           all" semantics by default. Note that regardless of whether this flag is used, "dot all" semantics can
           still  be  controlled  via inline flags in the regex pattern itself, e.g., <b>(?s:.)</b> always enables "dot
           all" whereas <b>(?-s:.)</b> always disables "dot all". Moreover, you can use character classes like  <b>\p{any}</b>
           to match any Unicode codepoint regardless of whether "dot all" mode is enabled or not.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--no-multiline-dotall</b>.

       <b>--no-unicode</b>
           This flag disables Unicode mode for all patterns given to ripgrep.

           By  default,  ripgrep  will  enable  "Unicode  mode"  in  all  of  its  regexes. This has a number of
           consequences:

           •  <b>.</b> will only match valid UTF-8 encoded Unicode scalar values.

           •  Classes like <b>\w</b>, <b>\s</b>, <b>\d</b> are all Unicode aware and much bigger than their ASCII only versions.

           •  Case insensitive matching will use Unicode case folding.

           •  A large array of classes like <b>\p{Emoji}</b> are available.  (Although  the  specific  set  of  classes
              available  varies based on the regex engine. In general, the default regex engine has more classes
              available to it.)

           •  Word boundaries (<b>\b</b> and <b>\B</b>) use the Unicode definition of a word character.

           In some cases it can be desirable to turn these things off. This  flag  will  do  exactly  that.  For
           example,  Unicode  mode  can  sometimes have a negative impact on performance, especially when things
           like <b>\w</b> are used frequently (including via bounded repetitions like <b>\w{100}</b>) when  only  their  ASCII
           interpretation is needed.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--unicode</b>.

       <b>--null-data</b>
           Enabling this flag causes ripgrep to use <b>NUL</b> as a line terminator instead of the default of <b>\n</b>.

           This is useful when searching large binary files that would otherwise have very long lines if <b>\n</b> were
           used  as  the line terminator. In particular, ripgrep requires that, at a minimum, each line must fit
           into memory. Using <b>NUL</b> instead can be a useful stopgap to keep memory requirements low and avoid  OOM
           (out of memory) conditions.

           This  is  also  useful  for  processing NUL delimited data, such as that emitted when using ripgrep's
           <b>-0/--null</b> flag or <b>find</b>'s <b>--print0</b> flag.

           Using this flag implies <b>-a/--text</b>. It also overrides <b>--crlf</b>.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--pcre2</b>
           When this flag is present, ripgrep will use the PCRE2 regex  engine  instead  of  its  default  regex
           engine.

           This is generally useful when you want to use features such as look-around or backreferences.

           Using  this  flag is the same as passing <b>--engine=pcre2</b>. Users may instead elect to use <b>--engine=auto</b>
           to ask ripgrep to automatically select the right regex engine based on the patterns given. This  flag
           and the <b>--engine</b> flag override one another.

           Note  that  PCRE2  is an optional ripgrep feature. If PCRE2 wasn't included in your build of ripgrep,
           then using this flag will result in ripgrep printing an error message and  exiting.  PCRE2  may  also
           have  worse  user  experience  in  some  cases,  since it has fewer introspection APIs than ripgrep's
           default regex engine. For example, if you use a <b>\n</b> in a PCRE2 regex without the <b>-U/--multiline</b>  flag,
           then  ripgrep will silently fail to match anything instead of reporting an error immediately (like it
           does with the default regex engine).

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--no-pcre2</b>.

       <b>--regex-size-limit</b>=<u>NUM+SUFFIX?</u>
           The size limit of the compiled regex, where the compiled regex  generally  corresponds  to  a  single
           object  in  memory  that  can  match  all  of  the patterns provided to ripgrep. The default limit is
           generous enough that most reasonable patterns (or even a small number of them) should fit.

           This useful to change when you explicitly want to let ripgrep spend potentially much more time and/or
           memory building a regex matcher.

           The input format accepts suffixes of  <b>K</b>,  <b>M</b>  or  <b>G</b>  which  correspond  to  kilobytes,  megabytes  and
           gigabytes, respectively. If no suffix is provided the input is treated as bytes.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--smart-case</b>
           This  flag  instructs  ripgrep  to  searches  case  insensitively  if  the  pattern is all lowercase.
           Otherwise, ripgrep will search case sensitively.

           A pattern is considered all lowercase if both of the following rules hold:

           •  First, the pattern contains at least one literal character. For example, <b>a\w</b>  contains  a  literal
              (<b>a</b>) but just <b>\w</b> does not.

           •  Second,  of  the literals in the pattern, none of them are considered to be uppercase according to
              Unicode. For example, <b>foo\pL</b> has no uppercase literals but <b>Foo\pL</b> does.

           This overrides the <b>-s/--case-sensitive</b> and <b>-i/--ignore-case</b> flags.

       <b>--stop-on-nonmatch</b>
           Enabling this option will cause ripgrep to stop reading a file once it encounters a non-matching line
           after it has encountered a matching line.  This is useful if it is expected that  all  matches  in  a
           given file will be on sequential lines, for example due to the lines being sorted.

           This overrides the <b>-U/--multiline</b> flag.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--text</b>
           This  flag  instructs ripgrep to search binary files as if they were text. When this flag is present,
           ripgrep's binary file detection is disabled. This means that when a  binary  file  is  searched,  its
           contents may be printed if there is a match. This may cause escape codes to be printed that alter the
           behavior of your terminal.

           When  binary file detection is enabled, it is imperfect. In general, it uses a simple heuristic. If a
           <b>NUL</b> byte is seen during search, then the file is considered binary and searching stops  (unless  this
           flag  is  present).  Alternatively, if the <b>--binary</b> flag is used, then ripgrep will only quit when it
           sees a <b>NUL</b> byte after it sees a match (or searches the entire file).

           This flag overrides the <b>--binary</b> flag.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--no-text</b>.

       <b>-j</b> <u>NUM</u>, <b>--threads</b>=<u>NUM</u>
           This flag sets the approximate number of threads to use. A value of <b>0</b> (which is the  default)  causes
           ripgrep to choose the thread count using heuristics.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--word-regexp</b>
           When  enabled,  ripgrep  will only show matches surrounded by word boundaries.  This is equivalent to
           surrounding every pattern with <b>\b{start-half}</b> and <b>\b{end-half}</b>.

           This overrides the <b>-x/--line-regexp</b> flag.

       <b>--auto-hybrid-regex</b>
           DEPRECATED. Use <b>--engine</b> instead.

           When this flag is used, ripgrep will dynamically choose between supported regex engines depending  on
           the features used in a pattern. When ripgrep chooses a regex engine, it applies that choice for every
           regex provided to ripgrep (e.g., via multiple <b>-e/--regexp</b> or <b>-f/--file</b> flags).

           As  an example of how this flag might behave, ripgrep will attempt to use its default finite automata
           based regex engine whenever the pattern can be successfully compiled with that regex engine. If PCRE2
           is enabled and if the pattern given could not be compiled with the default regex engine,  then  PCRE2
           will  be  automatically  used  for  searching. If PCRE2 isn't available, then this flag has no effect
           because there is only one regex engine to choose from.

           In the future, ripgrep may adjust its heuristics for how it decides which regex  engine  to  use.  In
           general, the heuristics will be limited to a static analysis of the patterns, and not to any specific
           runtime behavior observed while searching files.

           The  primary  downside  of  using  this  flag is that it may not always be obvious which regex engine
           ripgrep uses, and thus, the match  semantics  or  performance  profile  of  ripgrep  may  subtly  and
           unexpectedly change. However, in many cases, all regex engines will agree on what constitutes a match
           and  it  can  be  nice  to  transparently  support  more advanced regex features like look-around and
           backreferences without explicitly needing to enable them.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--no-auto-hybrid-regex</b>.

       <b>--no-pcre2-unicode</b>
           DEPRECATED. Use <b>--no-unicode</b> instead.

           Note that Unicode mode is enabled by default.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--pcre2-unicode</b>.

   <b>FILTER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>--binary</b>
           Enabling this flag will cause ripgrep to  search  binary  files.  By  default,  ripgrep  attempts  to
           automatically  skip  binary  files  in  order to improve the relevance of results and make the search
           faster.

           Binary files are heuristically detected based on whether they contain a <b>NUL</b> byte or not.  By  default
           (without  this flag set), once a <b>NUL</b> byte is seen, ripgrep will stop searching the file. Usually, <b>NUL</b>
           bytes occur in the beginning of most binary files. If a <b>NUL</b> byte occurs after a match,  then  ripgrep
           will  not  print  the match, stop searching that file, and emit a warning that some matches are being
           suppressed.

           In contrast, when this flag is provided, ripgrep will continue searching a file even if a <b>NUL</b> byte is
           found. In particular, if a <b>NUL</b> byte is found then ripgrep will  continue  searching  until  either  a
           match  is  found or the end of the file is reached, whichever comes sooner. If a match is found, then
           ripgrep will stop and print a warning saying that the search stopped prematurely.

           If you want ripgrep to search a file without any special <b>NUL</b> byte handling at  all  (and  potentially
           print binary data to stdout), then you should use the <b>-a/--text</b> flag.

           The <b>--binary</b> flag is a flag for controlling ripgrep's automatic filtering mechanism. As such, it does
           not  need  to  be  used when searching a file explicitly or when searching stdin. That is, it is only
           applicable when recursively searching a directory.

           When the <b>-u/--unrestricted</b> flag is provided for  a  third  time,  then  this  flag  is  automatically
           enabled.

           This flag overrides the <b>-a/--text</b> flag.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--no-binary</b>.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--follow</b>
           This  flag  instructs ripgrep to follow symbolic links while traversing directories. This behavior is
           disabled by default. Note that ripgrep will check for symbolic link loops and  report  errors  if  it
           finds  one.  ripgrep  will  also  report errors for broken links. To suppress error messages, use the
           <b>--no-messages</b> flag.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--no-follow</b>.

       <b>-g</b> <u>GLOB</u>, <b>--glob</b>=<u>GLOB</u>
           Include or exclude files and directories for  searching  that  match  the  given  glob.  This  always
           overrides  any  other  ignore logic. Multiple glob flags may be used. Globbing rules match <b>.gitignore</b>
           globs. Precede a glob with a <b>!</b> to exclude it. If multiple globs match a file or directory,  the  glob
           given later in the command line takes precedence.

           As an extension, globs support specifying alternatives: <b>-g</b> <b>'</b><u>ab{c,d}*</u><b>'</b> is equivalent to <b>-g</b> <u>abc</u> <b>-g</b> <u>abd.</u>
           Empty  alternatives  like <b>-g</b> <b>'</b><u>ab{,c}</u><b>'</b> are not currently supported. Note that this syntax extension is
           also currently enabled in <b>gitignore</b> files, even though this syntax isn't  supported  by  git  itself.
           ripgrep may disable this syntax extension in gitignore files, but it will always remain available via
           the <b>-g/--glob</b> flag.

           When this flag is set, every file and directory is applied to it to test for a match. For example, if
           you  only want to search in a particular directory <u>foo</u>, then <b>-g</b> <u>foo</u> is incorrect because <u>foo/bar</u> does
           not match the glob <u>foo</u>. Instead, you should use <b>-g</b> <b>'</b><u>foo/**</u><b>'.</b>

       <b>--glob-case-insensitive</b>
           Process all glob patterns given with the <b>-g/--glob</b> flag case insensitively.  This effectively  treats
           <b>-g/--glob</b> as <b>--iglob</b>.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--no-glob-case-insensitive</b>.

       <b>-.</b>, <b>--hidden</b>
           Search  hidden files and directories. By default, hidden files and directories are skipped. Note that
           if a hidden file or a directory is whitelisted in an ignore file, then it will be  searched  even  if
           this flag isn't provided.  Similarly if a hidden file or directory is given explicitly as an argument
           to ripgrep.

           A  file  or  directory  is  considered  hidden  if  its base name starts with a dot character (<b>.</b>). On
           operating systems which support a "hidden" file attribute, like Windows, files  with  this  attribute
           are also considered hidden.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--no-hidden</b>.

       <b>--iglob</b>=<u>GLOB</u>
           Include  or  exclude  files  and  directories  for  searching  that match the given glob. This always
           overrides any other ignore logic. Multiple glob flags may be used. Globbing  rules  match  <b>.gitignore</b>
           globs.  Precede  a glob with a <b>!</b> to exclude it. If multiple globs match a file or directory, the glob
           given later in the command line  takes  precedence.  Globs  used  via  this  flag  are  matched  case
           insensitively.

       <b>--ignore-file</b>=<u>PATH</u>
           Specifies  a  path  to one or more <b>gitignore</b> formatted rules files.  These patterns are applied after
           the patterns found in <b>.gitignore</b>, <b>.rgignore</b> and <b>.ignore</b> are applied and are matched relative  to  the
           current  working  directory.  Multiple  additional  ignore  files can be specified by using this flag
           repeatedly. When specifying multiple ignore files, earlier files have  lower  precedence  than  later
           files.

           If  you  are  looking  for  a way to include or exclude files and directories directly on the command
           line, then use <b>-g/--glob</b> instead.

       <b>--ignore-file-case-insensitive</b>
           Process ignore files (<b>.gitignore</b>, <b>.ignore</b>, etc.) case insensitively. Note  that  this  comes  with  a
           performance penalty and is most useful on case insensitive file systems (such as Windows).

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--no-ignore-file-case-insensitive</b>.

       <b>-d</b> <u>NUM</u>, <b>--max-depth</b>=<u>NUM</u>
           This  flag limits the depth of directory traversal to <u>NUM</u> levels beyond the paths given. A value of <b>0</b>
           only searches the explicitly given paths themselves.

           For example, <b>rg</b> <b>--max-depth</b> <b>0</b> <u>dir/</u> is a no-op because <u>dir/</u> will not be descended into. <b>rg</b> <b>--max-depth</b>
           <b>1</b> <u>dir/</u> will search only the direct children of <u>dir</u>.

           An alternative spelling for this flag is <b>--maxdepth</b>.

       <b>--max-filesize</b>=<u>NUM+SUFFIX?</u>
           Ignore files larger than <u>NUM</u> in size. This does not apply to directories.

           The input format accepts suffixes of  <b>K</b>,  <b>M</b>  or  <b>G</b>  which  correspond  to  kilobytes,  megabytes  and
           gigabytes, respectively. If no suffix is provided the input is treated as bytes.

           Examples: <b>--max-filesize</b> <b>50K</b> or <b>--max-filesize</b> <b>80M</b>.

       <b>--no-ignore</b>
           When  set, ignore files such as <b>.gitignore</b>, <b>.ignore</b> and <b>.rgignore</b> will not be respected. This implies
           <b>--no-ignore-dot</b>, <b>--no-ignore-exclude</b>, <b>--no-ignore-global</b>, <b>--no-ignore-parent</b> and <b>--no-ignore-vcs</b>.

           This does not imply <b>--no-ignore-files</b>, since <b>--ignore-file</b> is specified explicitly as a command  line
           argument.

           When  given  only  once,  the <b>-u/--unrestricted</b> flag is identical in behavior to this flag and can be
           considered an alias. However, subsequent <b>-u/--unrestricted</b> flags have additional effects.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--ignore</b>.

       <b>--no-ignore-dot</b>
           Don't respect filter rules from <b>.ignore</b> or <b>.rgignore</b> files.

           This does not impact whether ripgrep will ignore files and directories whose names begin with a  dot.
           For  that,  see  the  <b>-./--hidden</b>  flag.  This  flag  also  does not impact whether filter rules from
           <b>.gitignore</b> files are respected.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--ignore-dot</b>.

       <b>--no-ignore-exclude</b>
           Don't respect filter rules from files that are manually configured for the repository.  For  example,
           this includes <b>git</b>'s <b>.git/info/exclude</b>.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--ignore-exclude</b>.

       <b>--no-ignore-files</b>
           When set, any <b>--ignore-file</b> flags, even ones that come after this flag, are ignored.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--ignore-files</b>.

       <b>--no-ignore-global</b>
           Don't  respect  filter  rules  from  ignore  files  that  come  from  "global"  sources such as <b>git</b>'s
           <b>core.excludesFile</b> configuration option (which defaults to <b>$HOME/.config/git/ignore</b>).

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--ignore-global</b>.

       <b>--no-ignore-parent</b>
           When this flag is set, filter rules from ignore files found in parent directories are not  respected.
           By  default,  ripgrep will ascend the parent directories of the current working directory to look for
           any applicable ignore files that should be applied. In some cases this may not be desirable.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--ignore-parent</b>.

       <b>--no-ignore-vcs</b>
           When given, filter rules from source control ignore files (e.g., <b>.gitignore</b>) are  not  respected.  By
           default,  ripgrep  respects  <b>git</b>'s ignore rules for automatic filtering. In some cases, it may not be
           desirable to respect the source control's ignore rules and instead only respect rules in  <b>.ignore</b>  or
           <b>.rgignore</b>.

           This flag implies <b>--no-ignore-parent</b> for source control ignore files as well.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--ignore-vcs</b>.

       <b>--no-require-git</b>
           When  this flag is given, source control ignore files such as <b>.gitignore</b> are respected even if no <b>git</b>
           repository is present.

           By default, ripgrep will only respect filter rules from source  control  ignore  files  when  ripgrep
           detects  that  the  search  is  executed inside a source control repository. For example, when a <b>.git</b>
           directory is observed.

           This flag relaxes the default restriction. For example, it might be useful when the contents of a <b>git</b>
           repository are stored or copied somewhere, but where the repository state is absent.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--require-git</b>.

       <b>--one-file-system</b>
           When enabled, ripgrep will not cross file system boundaries relative  to  where  the  search  started
           from.

           Note that this applies to each path argument given to ripgrep. For example, in the command

               rg --one-file-system /foo/bar /quux/baz

           ripgrep  will search both <u>/foo/bar</u> and <u>/quux/baz</u> even if they are on different file systems, but will
           not cross a file system boundary when traversing each path's directory tree.

           This is similar to <b>find</b>'s <b>-xdev</b> or <b>-mount</b> flag.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--no-one-file-system</b>.

       <b>-t</b> <u>TYPE</u>, <b>--type</b>=<u>TYPE</u>
           This flag limits ripgrep to searching files matching <u>TYPE</u>. Multiple <b>-t/--type</b> flags may be provided.

           This flag supports the special value <b>all</b>, which will behave as if <b>-t/--type</b> was  provided  for  every
           file  type  supported by ripgrep (including any custom file types). The end result is that <b>--type=all</b>
           causes ripgrep to search in "whitelist" mode, where it will only search files it recognizes  via  its
           type definitions.

           Note  that  this flag has lower precedence than both the <b>-g/--glob</b> flag and any rules found in ignore
           files.

           To see the list of available file types, use the <b>--type-list</b> flag.

       <b>-T</b> <u>TYPE</u>, <b>--type-not</b>=<u>TYPE</u>
           Do not search files matching <u>TYPE</u>. Multiple <b>-T/--type-not</b> flags may be provided. Use the  <b>--type-list</b>
           flag to list all available types.

           This  flag  supports  the  special  value <b>all</b>, which will behave as if <b>-T/--type-not</b> was provided for
           every file type supported by ripgrep (including any custom  file  types).  The  end  result  is  that
           <b>--type-not=all</b> causes ripgrep to search in "blacklist" mode, where it will only search files that are
           unrecognized by its type definitions.

           To see the list of available file types, use the <b>--type-list</b> flag.

       <b>--type-add</b>=<u>TYPESPEC</u>
           This  flag adds a new glob for a particular file type. Only one glob can be added at a time. Multiple
           <b>--type-add</b> flags can be provided. Unless <b>--type-clear</b> is used, globs are added to any existing  globs
           defined inside of ripgrep.

           Note  that  this  must be passed to every invocation of ripgrep. Type settings are not persisted. See
           <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILES</b> for a workaround.

           Example:

               rg --type-add 'foo:*.foo' -tfoo <u>PATTERN</u>

           This flag can also be used to include rules from other types with the special include directive.  The
           include  directive  permits  specifying one or more other type names (separated by a comma) that have
           been defined and its rules will automatically be imported into the type specified.  For  example,  to
           create a type called src that matches C++, Python and Markdown files, one can use:

               --type-add 'src:include:cpp,py,md'

           Additional glob rules can still be added to the src type by using this flag again:

               --type-add 'src:include:cpp,py,md' --type-add 'src:*.foo'

           Note that type names must consist only of Unicode letters or numbers.  Punctuation characters are not
           allowed.

       <b>--type-clear</b>=<u>TYPE</u>
           Clear  the  file type globs previously defined for <u>TYPE</u>. This clears any previously defined globs for
           the <u>TYPE</u>, but globs can be added after this flag.

           Note that this must be passed to every invocation of ripgrep. Type settings are  not  persisted.  See
           <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILES</b> for a workaround.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--unrestricted</b>
           This  flag reduces the level of "smart" filtering. Repeated uses (up to 3) reduces the filtering even
           more. When repeated three times, ripgrep will search every file in a directory tree.

           A single <b>-u/--unrestricted</b>  flag  is  equivalent  to  <b>--no-ignore</b>.  Two  <b>-u/--unrestricted</b>  flags  is
           equivalent  to  <b>--no-ignore</b>  <b>-./--hidden</b>.  Three <b>-u/--unrestricted</b> flags is equivalent to <b>--no-ignore</b>
           <b>-./--hidden</b> <b>--binary</b>.

           The only filtering ripgrep still does when <b>-uuu</b> is given is to  skip  symbolic  links  and  to  avoid
           printing  matches  from  binary  files.  Symbolic links can be followed via the <b>-L/--follow</b> flag, and
           binary files can be treated as text files via the <b>-a/--text</b> flag.

   <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-A</b> <u>NUM</u>, <b>--after-context</b>=<u>NUM</u>
           Show <u>NUM</u> lines after each match.

           This overrides the <b>--passthru</b> flag and partially overrides the <b>-C/--context</b> flag.

       <b>-B</b> <u>NUM</u>, <b>--before-context</b>=<u>NUM</u>
           Show <u>NUM</u> lines before each match.

           This overrides the <b>--passthru</b> flag and partially overrides the <b>-C/--context</b> flag.

       <b>--block-buffered</b>
           When enabled, ripgrep will use block buffering. That is, whenever a matching line is found,  it  will
           be  written  to  an  in-memory  buffer  and  will not be written to stdout until the buffer reaches a
           certain size. This is the default when ripgrep's stdout is redirected to a pipeline or a  file.  When
           ripgrep's  stdout  is  connected  to  a  tty,  line  buffering will be used by default. Forcing block
           buffering can be useful when dumping a large amount of contents to a tty.

           This overrides the <b>--line-buffered</b> flag.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--no-block-buffered</b>.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--byte-offset</b>
           Print the 0-based byte offset within the input file  before  each  line  of  output.   If  <b>-o/--only-</b>
           <b>matching</b> is specified, print the offset of the matched text itself.

           If  ripgrep  does  transcoding, then the byte offset is in terms of the result of transcoding and not
           the original data. This applies similarly to other transformations on the data, such as decompression
           or a <b>--pre</b> filter.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--no-byte-offset</b>.

       <b>--color</b>=<u>WHEN</u>
           This flag controls when to use colors. The default setting is <b>auto</b>, which means ripgrep will  try  to
           guess  when to use colors. For example, if ripgrep is printing to a tty, then it will use colors, but
           if it is redirected to a file or a pipe, then it will suppress color output.

           ripgrep will suppress color output by default in some other circumstances as well. These include, but
           are not limited to:

           •  When the <b>TERM</b> environment variable is not set or set to <b>dumb</b>.

           •  When the <b>NO_COLOR</b> environment variable is set (regardless of value).

           •  When flags that imply no use for colors are given. For example, <b>--vimgrep</b> and <b>--json</b>.

           The possible values for this flag are:

           <b>never</b>     Colors will never be used.

           <b>auto</b>      The default. ripgrep tries to be smart.

           <b>always</b>    Colors will always be used regardless of where output is sent.

           <b>ansi</b>      Like 'always', but emits ANSI escapes (even in a Windows console).

           This flag also controls whether hyperlinks are emitted. For  example,  when  a  hyperlink  format  is
           specified,  hyperlinks won't be used when color is suppressed. If one wants to emit hyperlinks but no
           colors, then one must use the <b>--colors</b> flag to manually set all color styles to <b>none</b>:

               --colors 'path:none' \
               --colors 'line:none' \
               --colors 'column:none' \
               --colors 'match:none'

       <b>--colors</b>=<u>COLOR_SPEC</u>
           This flag specifies color settings for use in the output. This flag may be provided  multiple  times.
           Settings are applied iteratively. Pre-existing color labels are limited to one of eight choices: <b>red</b>,
           <b>blue</b>,  <b>green</b>,  <b>cyan</b>, <b>magenta</b>, <b>yellow</b>, <b>white</b> and <b>black</b>. Styles are limited to <b>nobold</b>, <b>bold</b>, <b>nointense</b>,
           <b>intense</b>, <b>nounderline</b> or <b>underline</b>.

           The format of the flag is <b>{</b><u>type</u><b>}:{</b><u>attribute</u><b>}:{</b><u>value</u><b>}</b>.  <u>type</u> should be one of <b>path</b>,  <b>line</b>,  <b>column</b>  or
           <b>match</b>.  <u>attribute</u> can be <b>fg</b>, <b>bg</b> or <b>style</b>.  <u>value</u> is either a color (for <b>fg</b> and <b>bg</b>) or a text style. A
           special format, <b>{</b><u>type</u><b>}:none</b>, will clear all color settings for <u>type</u>.

           For example, the following command will change the match color to magenta and  the  background  color
           for line numbers to yellow:

               rg --colors 'match:fg:magenta' --colors 'line:bg:yellow'

           Extended colors can be used for <u>value</u> when the tty supports ANSI color sequences. These are specified
           as  either <u>x</u> (256-color) or <u>x</u><b>,</b><u>x</u><b>,</b><u>x</u> (24-bit truecolor) where <u>x</u> is a number between <b>0</b> and <b>255</b> inclusive.
           <u>x</u> may be given as a normal decimal number or a hexadecimal number, which is prefixed by <b>0x</b>.

           For example, the following command will change the match background color to that represented by  the
           rgb value (0,128,255):

               rg --colors 'match:bg:0,128,255'

           or, equivalently,

               rg --colors 'match:bg:0x0,0x80,0xFF'

           Note  that  the  <b>intense</b>  and <b>nointense</b> styles will have no effect when used alongside these extended
           color codes.

       <b>--column</b>
           Show column numbers (1-based). This only shows the column numbers for the first match on  each  line.
           This  does  not  try to account for Unicode. One byte is equal to one column. This implies <b>-n/--line-</b>
           <b>number</b>.

           When <b>-o/--only-matching</b> is used, then the column numbers written correspond  to  the  start  of  each
           match.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--no-column</b>.

       <b>-C</b> <u>NUM</u>, <b>--context</b>=<u>NUM</u>
           Show  <u>NUM</u>  lines  before  and after each match. This is equivalent to providing both the <b>-B/--before-</b>
           <b>context</b> and <b>-A/--after-context</b> flags with the same value.

           This overrides the  <b>--passthru</b>  flag.  The  <b>-A/--after-context</b>  and  <b>-B/--before-context</b>  flags  both
           partially override this flag, regardless of the order. For example, <b>-A2</b> <b>-C1</b> is equivalent to <b>-A2</b> <b>-B1</b>.

       <b>--context-separator</b>=<u>SEPARATOR</u>
           The string used to separate non-contiguous context lines in the output. This is only used when one of
           the  context flags is used (that is, <b>-A/--after-context</b>, <b>-B/--before-context</b> or <b>-C/--context</b>). Escape
           sequences like <b>\x7F</b> or <b>\t</b> may be used. The default value is <b>--</b>.

           When the context separator is set to an empty string,  then  a  line  break  is  still  inserted.  To
           completely disable context separators, use the <b>--no-context-separator</b> flag.

       <b>--field-context-separator</b>=<u>SEPARATOR</u>
           Set  the  field  context separator. This separator is only used when printing contextual lines. It is
           used to delimit file paths, line numbers, columns and the contextual line itself. The  separator  may
           be any number of bytes, including zero. Escape sequences like <b>\x7F</b> or <b>\t</b> may be used.

           The <b>-</b> character is the default value.

       <b>--field-match-separator</b>=<u>SEPARATOR</u>
           Set  the  field match separator. This separator is only used when printing matching lines. It is used
           to delimit file paths, line numbers, columns and the matching line itself. The separator may  be  any
           number of bytes, including zero.  Escape sequences like <b>\x7F</b> or <b>\t</b> may be used.

           The <b>:</b> character is the default value.

       <b>--heading</b>
           This  flag prints the file path above clusters of matches from each file instead of printing the file
           path as a prefix for each matched line.

           This is the default mode when printing to a tty.

           When <b>stdout</b> is not a tty, then ripgrep will default to the standard grep-like format. One  can  force
           this  format  in Unix-like environments by piping the output of ripgrep to <b>cat</b>. For example, <b>rg</b> <u>foo</u> <b>|</b>
           <b>cat</b>.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--no-heading</b>.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           This flag prints the help output for ripgrep.

           Unlike most other flags, the behavior of the short flag, <b>-h</b>, and the long flag, <b>--help</b>, is different.
           The short flag will show a condensed help output while the long flag will show a verbose help output.
           The verbose help output has complete documentation, where as the condensed help output will show only
           a single line for every flag.

       <b>--hostname-bin</b>=<u>COMMAND</u>
           This flag controls how ripgrep determines this system's hostname. The flag's value should  correspond
           to  an  executable  (either  a path or something that can be found via your system's <b>PATH</b> environment
           variable). When set, ripgrep will run this executable, with no arguments, and treat its output  (with
           leading and trailing whitespace stripped) as your system's hostname.

           When  not  set  (the  default,  or  the  empty string), ripgrep will try to automatically detect your
           system's hostname. On Unix, this corresponds to calling <b>gethostname</b>. On Windows, this corresponds  to
           calling <b>GetComputerNameExW</b> to fetch the system's "physical DNS hostname."

           ripgrep uses your system's hostname for producing hyperlinks.

       <b>--hyperlink-format</b>=<u>FORMAT</u>
           Set  the  format  of  hyperlinks  to  use  when printing results. Hyperlinks make certain elements of
           ripgrep's output, such as file paths, clickable. This generally only works in terminal emulators that
           support OSC-8 hyperlinks.  For  example,  the  format  <b>file://{host}{path}</b>  will  emit  an  RFC  8089
           hyperlink.  To see the format that ripgrep is using, pass the <b>--debug</b> flag.

           Alternatively,  a  format string may correspond to one of the following aliases: <b>default</b>, <b>none</b>, <b>file</b>,
           <b>grep+</b>, <b>kitty</b>, <b>macvim</b>, <b>textmate</b>, <b>vscode</b>, <b>vscode-insiders</b>, <b>vscodium</b>. The alias will be replaced with  a
           format string that is intended to work for the corresponding application.

           The following variables are available in the format string:

           <b>{path}</b>      Required.  This  is replaced with a path to a matching file. The path is guaranteed to be
                       absolute and percent encoded such that it is valid to put into a URI. Note that a path is
                       guaranteed to start with a <a href="file:/.">/.</a>

           <b>{host}</b>      Optional. This is replaced with your system's hostname.  On  Unix,  this  corresponds  to
                       calling  <b>gethostname</b>. On Windows, this corresponds to calling <b>GetComputerNameExW</b> to fetch
                       the system's "physical DNS hostname."  Alternatively,  if  <b>--hostname-bin</b>  was  provided,
                       then  the  hostname  returned  from  the  output  of that program will be returned. If no
                       hostname could be found, then this variable is replaced with the empty string.

           <b>{line}</b>      Optional. If appropriate, this is replaced with the line number of a match.  If  no  line
                       number   is   available  (for  example,  if  <b>--no-line-number</b>  was  given),  then  it  is
                       automatically replaced with the value 1.

           <b>{column}</b>    Optional, but requires the presence of <b>{line}</b>. If appropriate, this is replaced with  the
                       column  number  of a match. If no column number is available (for example, if <b>--no-column</b>
                       was given), then it is automatically replaced with the value 1.

           <b>{wslprefix}</b> Optional.  This  is  a  special  value  that  is  set  to   <b>wsl$/</b><u>WSL_DISTRO_NAME</u>,   where
                       <u>WSL_DISTRO_NAME</u>  corresponds  to the value of the equivalent environment variable. If the
                       system is not Unix or if the <u>WSL_DISTRO_NAME</u> environment variable is not set,  then  this
                       is replaced with the empty string.

           A  format  string may be empty. An empty format string is equivalent to the <b>none</b> alias. In this case,
           hyperlinks will be disabled.

           At present, ripgrep does not enable hyperlinks by default. Users must opt into them.  If  you  aren't
           sure what format to use, try <b>default</b>.

           Like  colors,  when  ripgrep  detects  that  stdout  is  not  connected to a tty, then hyperlinks are
           automatically disabled, regardless of the value of this  flag.   Users  can  pass  <b>--color=always</b>  to
           forcefully emit hyperlinks.

           Note  that  hyperlinks  are only written when a path is also in the output and colors are enabled. To
           write hyperlinks without colors, you'll need to configure ripgrep to not  colorize  anything  without
           actually disabling all ANSI escape codes completely:

               --colors 'path:none' \
               --colors 'line:none' \
               --colors 'column:none' \
               --colors 'match:none'

           ripgrep  works  this  way because it treats the <b>--color</b> flag as a proxy for whether ANSI escape codes
           should be used at all. This means that environment variables like <b>NO_COLOR=1</b> and <b>TERM=dumb</b>  not  only
           disable colors, but hyperlinks as well. Similarly, colors and hyperlinks are disabled when ripgrep is
           not writing to a tty. (Unless one forces the issue by setting <b>--color=always</b>.)

           If you're searching a file directly, for example:

               rg foo path/to/file

           then  hyperlinks  will not be emitted since the path given does not appear in the output. To make the
           path appear, and thus also a hyperlink, use the <b>-H/--with-filename</b> flag.

           For     more      information      on      hyperlinks      in      terminal      emulators,      see:
           https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda

       <b>--include-zero</b>
           When  used with <b>-c/--count</b> or <b>--count-matches</b>, this causes ripgrep to print the number of matches for
           each file even if there were zero matches. This is disabled by default but can  be  enabled  to  make
           ripgrep behave more like grep.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--no-include-zero</b>.

       <b>--line-buffered</b>
           When  enabled, ripgrep will always use line buffering. That is, whenever a matching line is found, it
           will be flushed to stdout immediately. This is the default when ripgrep's stdout is  connected  to  a
           tty,  but  otherwise,  ripgrep  will use block buffering, which is typically faster. This flag forces
           ripgrep to use line buffering even if it would otherwise  use  block  buffering.  This  is  typically
           useful in shell pipelines, for example:

               tail -f something.log | rg foo --line-buffered | rg bar

           This overrides the <b>--block-buffered</b> flag.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--no-line-buffered</b>.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--line-number</b>
           Show line numbers (1-based).

           This is enabled by default when stdout is connected to a tty.

           This flag can be disabled by <b>-N/--no-line-number</b>.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--no-line-number</b>
           Suppress line numbers.

           Line numbers are off by default when stdout is not connected to a tty.

           Line numbers can be forcefully turned on by <b>-n/--line-number</b>.

       <b>-M</b> <u>NUM</u>, <b>--max-columns</b>=<u>NUM</u>
           When  given, ripgrep will omit lines longer than this limit in bytes. Instead of printing long lines,
           only the number of matches in that line is printed.

           When this flag is omitted or is set to <b>0</b>, then it has no effect.

       <b>--max-columns-preview</b>
           Prints a preview for lines exceeding the configured max column limit.

           When the <b>-M/--max-columns</b> flag is used, ripgrep will by default completely replace any line  that  is
           too  long with a message indicating that a matching line was removed. When this flag is combined with
           <b>-M/--max-columns</b>, a preview of the line (corresponding to the limit size) is shown instead, where the
           part of the line exceeding the limit is not shown.

           If the <b>-M/--max-columns</b> flag is not set, then this has no effect.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--no-max-columns-preview</b>.

       <b>-0</b>, <b>--null</b>
           Whenever a file path is printed, follow it with a <b>NUL</b> byte. This includes printing file paths  before
           matches,  and when printing a list of matching files such as with <b>-c/--count</b>, <b>-l/--files-with-matches</b>
           and <b>--files</b>. This option is useful for use with <b>xargs</b>.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--only-matching</b>
           Print only the matched (non-empty) parts of a matching line, with each such part on a separate output
           line.

       <b>--path-separator</b>=<u>SEPARATOR</u>
           Set the path separator to use when printing  file  paths.  This  defaults  to  your  platform's  path
           separator,  which  is  <b>/</b>  on Unix and <b>\</b> on Windows.  This flag is intended for overriding the default
           when the environment demands it (e.g., cygwin). A path separator is limited to a single byte.

           Setting this flag to an empty string reverts it to its default behavior. That is, the path  separator
           is automatically chosen based on the environment.

       <b>--passthru</b>
           Print both matching and non-matching lines.

           Another  way  to achieve a similar effect is by modifying your pattern to match the empty string. For
           example, if you are searching using <b>rg</b> <u>foo</u>, then using <b>rg</b> <b>'^|</b><u>foo</u><b>'</b> instead will  emit  every  line  in
           every  file  searched,  but  only occurrences of <u>foo</u> will be highlighted.  This flag enables the same
           behavior without needing to modify the pattern.

           An alternative spelling for this flag is <b>--passthrough</b>.

           This overrides the <b>-C/--context</b>, <b>-A/--after-context</b> and <b>-B/--before-context</b> flags.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--pretty</b>
           This is a convenience alias for <b>--color=always</b> <b>--heading</b> <b>--line-number</b>. This flag is useful when  you
           still want pretty output even if you're piping ripgrep to another program or file. For example: <b>rg</b> <b>-p</b>
           <u>foo</u> <b>|</b> <b>less</b> <b>-R</b>.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
           Do  not  print  anything  to stdout. If a match is found in a file, then ripgrep will stop searching.
           This is useful when ripgrep is used only for its exit code (which will be an error code if no matches
           are found).

           When <b>--files</b> is used, ripgrep will stop finding files after finding the  first  file  that  does  not
           match any ignore rules.

       <b>-r</b> <u>REPLACEMENT</u>, <b>--replace</b>=<u>REPLACEMENT</u>
           Replaces  every  match  with  the  text  given when printing results. Neither this flag nor any other
           ripgrep flag will modify your files.

           Capture group indices (e.g., <b>$</b><u>5</u>) and names (e.g., <b>$</b><u>foo</u>) are  supported  in  the  replacement  string.
           Capture  group  indices  are  numbered based on the position of the opening parenthesis of the group,
           where the leftmost such group is <b>$</b><u>1</u>. The special <b>$</b><u>0</u> group corresponds to the entire match.

           The name of a group is formed by taking the longest string of letters, numbers and underscores  (i.e.
           <b>[_0-9A-Za-z]</b>)  after  the <b>$</b>. For example, <b>$</b><u>1a</u> will be replaced with the group named <u>1a</u>, not the group
           at index <u>1</u>. If the group's name contains characters that aren't letters, numbers or  underscores,  or
           you  want  to immediately follow the group with another string, the name should be put inside braces.
           For example, <b>${</b><u>1</u><b>}</b><u>a</u> will take the content of the group at index <u>1</u> and append <u>a</u> to the end of it.

           If an index or name does not refer to a valid capture group,  it  will  be  replaced  with  an  empty
           string.

           In  shells  such  as  Bash  and  zsh,  you should wrap the pattern in single quotes instead of double
           quotes. Otherwise, capture group indices will be replaced by expanded shell variables which will most
           likely be empty.

           To write a literal <b>$</b>, use <b>$$</b>.

           Note that the replacement by default replaces each match, and not the entire  line.  To  replace  the
           entire line, you should match the entire line.

           This flag can be used with the <b>-o/--only-matching</b> flag.

       <b>--sort</b>=<u>SORTBY</u>
           This flag enables sorting of results in ascending order. The possible values for this flag are:

           <b>none</b>        (Default) Do not sort results. Fastest. Can be multi-threaded.

           <b>path</b>        Sort  by  file  path. Always single-threaded. The order is determined by sorting files in
                       each directory entry during traversal. This means that given the files <b>a/b</b>  and  <b>a+</b>,  the
                       latter will sort after the former even though <b>+</b> would normally sort before <b>/</b>.

           <b>modified</b>    Sort by the last modified time on a file. Always single-threaded.

           <b>accessed</b>    Sort by the last accessed time on a file. Always single-threaded.

           <b>created</b>     Sort by the creation time on a file. Always single-threaded.

           If  the chosen (manually or by-default) sorting criteria isn't available on your system (for example,
           creation time is not available on ext4 file systems), then ripgrep will attempt to detect this, print
           an error and exit without searching.

           To sort results in reverse or descending order, use the <b>--sortr</b>  flag.   Also,  this  flag  overrides
           <b>--sortr</b>.

           Note  that sorting results currently always forces ripgrep to abandon parallelism and run in a single
           thread.

       <b>--sortr</b>=<u>SORTBY</u>
           This flag enables sorting of results in descending order. The possible values for this flag are:

           <b>none</b>        (Default) Do not sort results. Fastest. Can be multi-threaded.

           <b>path</b>        Sort by file path. Always single-threaded. The order is determined by  sorting  files  in
                       each  directory  entry  during traversal. This means that given the files <b>a/b</b> and <b>a+</b>, the
                       latter will sort before the former even though <b>+</b> would normally sort after <b>/</b> when doing a
                       reverse lexicographic sort.

           <b>modified</b>    Sort by the last modified time on a file. Always single-threaded.

           <b>accessed</b>    Sort by the last accessed time on a file. Always single-threaded.

           <b>created</b>     Sort by the creation time on a file. Always single-threaded.

           If the chosen (manually or by-default) sorting criteria isn't available on your system (for  example,
           creation time is not available on ext4 file systems), then ripgrep will attempt to detect this, print
           an error and exit without searching.

           To sort results in ascending order, use the <b>--sort</b> flag. Also, this flag overrides <b>--sort</b>.

           Note  that sorting results currently always forces ripgrep to abandon parallelism and run in a single
           thread.

       <b>--trim</b>
           When set, all ASCII whitespace at the beginning of each line printed will be removed.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--no-trim</b>.

       <b>--vimgrep</b>
           This flag instructs ripgrep to print results with every match on its own line, including line numbers
           and column numbers.

           With this option, a line with more than one match will be printed in its entirety more than once. For
           that reason, the total amount of output as a result of this flag can be quadratic in the size of  the
           input.  For  example,  if  the  pattern  matches  every byte in an input file, then each line will be
           repeated for every byte matched. For this reason, users should only use this flag when  there  is  no
           other  choice. Editor integrations should prefer some other way of reading results from ripgrep, such
           as via the <b>--json</b> flag.  One alternative to avoiding exorbitant memory usage is to force ripgrep into
           single threaded mode with the <b>-j/--threads</b> flag. Note though that this will not impact the total size
           of the output, just the heap memory that ripgrep will use.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--with-filename</b>
           This flag instructs ripgrep to print the file path for each matching line.  This is the default  when
           more  than  one  file  is searched. If <b>--heading</b> is enabled (the default when printing to a tty), the
           file path will be shown above clusters of matches from each file; otherwise, the file  name  will  be
           shown as a prefix for each matched line.

           This flag overrides <b>-I/--no-filename</b>.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--no-filename</b>
           This flag instructs ripgrep to never print the file path with each matching line. This is the default
           when ripgrep is explicitly instructed to search one file or stdin.

           This flag overrides <b>-H/--with-filename</b>.

       <b>--sort-files</b>
           DEPRECATED. Use <b>--sort=path</b> instead.

           This flag instructs ripgrep to sort search results by file path lexicographically in ascending order.
           Note that this currently disables all parallelism and runs search in a single thread.

           This flag overrides <b>--sort</b> and <b>--sortr</b>.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--no-sort-files</b>.

   <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>MODES</b>
       <b>-c</b>, <b>--count</b>
           This  flag  suppresses  normal output and shows the number of lines that match the given patterns for
           each file searched. Each file containing a match has its path and count printed on  each  line.  Note
           that  unless <b>-U/--multiline</b> is enabled, this reports the number of lines that match and not the total
           number of matches. In multiline mode, <b>-c/--count</b> is equivalent to <b>--count-matches</b>.

           If only one file is given to ripgrep, then only the count  is  printed  if  there  is  a  match.  The
           <b>-H/--with-filename</b> flag can be used to force printing the file path in this case. If you need a count
           to be printed regardless of whether there is a match, then use <b>--include-zero</b>.

           This  overrides  the  <b>--count-matches</b>  flag.  Note  that  when <b>-c/--count</b> is combined with <b>-o/--only-</b>
           <b>matching</b>, then ripgrep behaves as if <b>--count-matches</b> was given.

       <b>--count-matches</b>
           This flag suppresses normal output and shows the number of individual matches of the  given  patterns
           for  each  file  searched.  Each file containing matches has its path and match count printed on each
           line. Note that this reports the total number of individual matches and not the number of lines  that
           match.

           If  only  one  file  is  given  to  ripgrep,  then only the count is printed if there is a match. The
           <b>-H/--with-filename</b> flag can be used to force printing the file path in this case.

           This overrides the <b>-c/--count</b> flag. Note that when <b>-c/--count</b> is  combined  with  <b>-o/--only-matching</b>,
           then ripgrep behaves as if <b>--count-matches</b> was given.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--files-with-matches</b>
           Print only the paths with at least one match and suppress match contents.

           This overrides <b>--files-without-match</b>.

       <b>--files-without-match</b>
           Print the paths that contain zero matches and suppress match contents.

           This overrides <b>-l/--files-with-matches</b>.

       <b>--json</b>
           Enable printing results in a JSON Lines format.

           When  this flag is provided, ripgrep will emit a sequence of messages, each encoded as a JSON object,
           where there are five different message types:

           <b>begin</b>       A message that indicates a file is being searched and contains at least one match.

           <b>end</b>         A message the indicates a file is done being searched. This message also include  summary
                       statistics about the search for a particular file.

           <b>match</b>       A  message  that  indicates  a match was found. This includes the text and offsets of the
                       match.

           <b>context</b>     A message that indicates a contextual line was found. This includes the text of the line,
                       along with any match information if the search was inverted.

           <b>summary</b>     The final message emitted by ripgrep that contains summary statistics  about  the  search
                       across all files.

           Since  file  paths or the contents of files are not guaranteed to be valid UTF-8 and JSON itself must
           be representable by a Unicode encoding, ripgrep will emit all data elements as objects  with  one  of
           two keys: <b>text</b> or <b>bytes</b>. <b>text</b> is a normal JSON string when the data is valid UTF-8 while <b>bytes</b> is the
           base64 encoded contents of the data.

           The  JSON  Lines  format  is  only supported for showing search results. It cannot be used with other
           flags that emit other types of output, such  as  <b>--files</b>,  <b>-l/--files-with-matches</b>,  <b>--files-without-</b>
           <b>match</b>, <b>-c/--count</b> or <b>--count-matches</b>. ripgrep will report an error if any of the aforementioned flags
           are used in concert with <b>--json</b>.

           Other  flags  that  control  aspects  of  the  standard output such as <b>-o/--only-matching</b>, <b>--heading</b>,
           <b>-r/--replace</b>, <b>-M/--max-columns</b>, etc., have no effect when  <b>--json</b>  is  set.  However,  enabling  JSON
           output will always implicitly and unconditionally enable <b>--stats</b>.

           A  more  complete  description  of  the  JSON  format  used  can be found here: <u>https://docs.rs/grep-</u>
           <u>printer/*/grep_printer/struct.JSON.html</u>.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--no-json</b>.

   <b>LOGGING</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>--debug</b>
           Show debug messages. Please use this when filing a bug report.

           The <b>--debug</b> flag is generally useful for figuring out why  ripgrep  skipped  searching  a  particular
           file. The debug messages should mention all files skipped and why they were skipped.

           To  get  even  more  debug  output, use the <b>--trace</b> flag, which implies <b>--debug</b> along with additional
           trace data.

       <b>--no-ignore-messages</b>
           When this flag is enabled, all error messages related to parsing  ignore  files  are  suppressed.  By
           default,  error  messages  are printed to stderr. In cases where these errors are expected, this flag
           can be used to avoid seeing the noise produced by the messages.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--ignore-messages</b>.

       <b>--no-messages</b>
           This flag suppresses some error messages. Specifically, messages related to the  failed  opening  and
           reading of files. Error messages related to the syntax of the pattern are still shown.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--messages</b>.

       <b>--stats</b>
           When  enabled,  ripgrep  will print aggregate statistics about the search. When this flag is present,
           ripgrep will print at least the following stats to stdout at the end of the search: number of matched
           lines, number of files with matches, number of files searched, and the  time  taken  for  the  entire
           search to complete.

           This set of aggregate statistics may expand over time.

           This flag is always and implicitly enabled when <b>--json</b> is used.

           Note  that  this  flag  has no effect if <b>--files</b>, <b>-l/--files-with-matches</b> or <b>--files-without-match</b> is
           passed.

           This flag can be disabled with <b>--no-stats</b>.

       <b>--trace</b>
           Show trace messages. This shows even more detail than the <b>--debug</b> flag. Generally,  one  should  only
           use this if <b>--debug</b> doesn't emit the information you're looking for.

   <b>OTHER</b> <b>BEHAVIORS</b>
       <b>--files</b>
           Print  each  file  that  would be searched without actually performing the search.  This is useful to
           determine whether a particular file is being searched or not.

           This overrides <b>--type-list</b>.

       <b>--generate</b>=<u>KIND</u>
           This flag instructs ripgrep to generate some special kind of output identified by <u>KIND</u> and then  quit
           without searching. <u>KIND</u> can be one of the following values:

           <b>man</b>            Generates a manual page for ripgrep in the <b>roff</b> format.

           <b>complete-bash</b>  Generates a completion script for the <b>bash</b> shell.

           <b>complete-zsh</b>   Generates a completion script for the <b>zsh</b> shell.

           <b>complete-fish</b>  Generates a completion script for the <b>fish</b> shell.

           <b>complete-powershell</b>
                          Generates a completion script for PowerShell.

           The output is written to <b>stdout</b>. The list above may expand over time.

       <b>--no-config</b>
           When  set,  ripgrep  will never read configuration files. When this flag is present, ripgrep will not
           respect the <b>RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH</b> environment variable.

           If ripgrep ever grows a feature to automatically read configuration files in  pre-defined  locations,
           then this flag will also disable that behavior as well.

       <b>--pcre2-version</b>
           When  this  flag  is  present,  ripgrep  will  print  the  version  of PCRE2 in use, along with other
           information, and then exit. If PCRE2 is not available, then ripgrep will print an error  message  and
           exit with an error code.

       <b>--type-list</b>
           Show  all  supported  file types and their corresponding globs. This takes any <b>--type-add</b> and <b>--type-</b>
           <b>clear</b> flags given into account. Each type is printed on its own line, followed by  a  <b>:</b>  and  then  a
           comma-delimited list of globs for that type on the same line.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
           This  flag  prints  ripgrep's  version.  This  also may print other relevant information, such as the
           presence of target specific optimizations and the  <b>git</b>  revision  that  this  build  of  ripgrep  was
           compiled from.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       If ripgrep finds a match, then the exit status of the program is <b>0</b>.  If no match could be found, then the
       exit  status is <b>1</b>. If an error occurred, then the exit status is always <b>2</b> unless ripgrep was run with the
       <b>-q/--quiet</b> flag and a match was found. In summary:

       •  <b>0</b> exit status occurs only when at least one  match  was  found,  and  if  no  error  occurred,  unless
          <b>-q/--quiet</b> was given.

       •  <b>1</b> exit status occurs only when no match was found and no error occurred.

       •  <b>2</b>  exit status occurs when an error occurred. This is true for both catastrophic errors (e.g., a regex
          syntax error) and for soft errors (e.g., unable to read a file).

</pre><h4><b>AUTOMATIC</b> <b>FILTERING</b></h4><pre>
       ripgrep does a fair bit of automatic filtering by default. This section describes that filtering and  how
       to control it.

       <b>TIP</b>: To disable automatic filtering, use <b>rg</b> <b>-uuu</b>.

       ripgrep's  automatic  "smart"  filtering  is  one  of  the most apparent differentiating features between
       ripgrep and other tools like <b>grep</b>. As such, its behavior may be surprising to users that aren't expecting
       it.

       ripgrep does four types of filtering automatically:

       1. Files and directories that match ignore rules are not searched.

       2. Hidden files and directories are not searched.

       3. Binary files (files with a <b>NUL</b> byte) are not searched.

       4. Symbolic links are not followed.

       The first type of filtering is the most sophisticated. ripgrep will attempt  to  respect  your  <b>gitignore</b>
       rules as faithfully as possible. In particular, this includes the following:

       •  Any global rules, e.g., in <b>$HOME/.config/git/ignore</b>.

       •  Any  rules in relevant <b>.gitignore</b> files. This includes <b>.gitignore</b> files in parent directories that are
          part of the same <b>git</b> repository.  (Unless <b>--no-require-git</b> is given.)

       •  Any local rules, e.g., in <b>.git/info/exclude</b>.

       In some cases, ripgrep and <b>git</b> will not always be in sync in  terms  of  which  files  are  ignored.  For
       example,  a  file  that  is ignored via <b>.gitignore</b> but is tracked by <b>git</b> would not be searched by ripgrep
       even though <b>git</b> tracks it. This is unlikely to ever be fixed. Instead, you should either make  sure  your
       exclude rules match the files you track precisely, or otherwise use <b>git</b> <b>grep</b> for search.

       Additional ignore rules can be provided outside of a <b>git</b> context:

       •  Any rules in <b>.ignore</b>. ripgrep will also respect <b>.ignore</b> files in parent directories.

       •  Any rules in <b>.rgignore</b>. ripgrep will also respect <b>.rgignore</b> files in parent directories.

       •  Any rules in files specified with the <b>--ignore-file</b> flag.

       The precedence of ignore rules is as follows, with later items overriding earlier items:

       •  Files given by <b>--ignore-file</b>.

       •  Global gitignore rules, e.g., from <b>$HOME/.config/git/ignore</b>.

       •  Local rules from <b>.git/info/exclude</b>.

       •  Rules from <b>.gitignore</b>.

       •  Rules from <b>.ignore</b>.

       •  Rules from <b>.rgignore</b>.

       So  for example, if <u>foo</u> were in a <b>.gitignore</b> and <b>!</b><u>foo</u> were in an <b>.rgignore</b>, then <u>foo</u> would not be ignored
       since <b>.rgignore</b> takes precedence over <b>.gitignore</b>.

       Each of the types of filtering can be configured via command line flags:

       •  There are several flags starting with  <b>--no-ignore</b>  that  toggle  which,  if  any,  ignore  rules  are
          respected. <b>--no-ignore</b> by itself will disable all of them.

       •  <b>-./--hidden</b> will force ripgrep to search hidden files and directories.

       •  <b>--binary</b> will force ripgrep to search binary files.

       •  <b>-L/--follow</b> will force ripgrep to follow symlinks.

       As  a  special  short  hand,  the  <b>-u</b>  flag  can  be  specified  up to three times.  Each additional time
       incrementally decreases filtering:

       •  <b>-u</b> is equivalent to <b>--no-ignore</b>.

       •  <b>-uu</b> is equivalent to <b>--no-ignore</b> <b>--hidden</b>.

       •  <b>-uuu</b> is equivalent to <b>--no-ignore</b> <b>--hidden</b> <b>--binary</b>.

       In particular, <b>rg</b> <b>-uuu</b> should search the same exact content as <b>grep</b> <b>-r</b>.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       ripgrep supports reading configuration files that change ripgrep's default behavior. The  format  of  the
       configuration file is an "rc" style and is very simple. It is defined by two rules:

       1. Every line is a shell argument, after trimming whitespace.

       2. Lines starting with <b>#</b> (optionally preceded by any amount of whitespace) are ignored.

       ripgrep  will  look  for  a  single configuration file if and only if the <b>RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH</b> environment
       variable is set and is non-empty.  ripgrep will parse arguments from this file on startup and will behave
       as if the arguments in this file were prepended to any explicit arguments given to ripgrep on the command
       line. Note though that the <b>rg</b> command you run must still be valid. That is, it  must  always  contain  at
       least one pattern at the command line, even if the configuration file uses the <b>-e/--regexp</b> flag.

       For example, if your ripgreprc file contained a single line:

           --smart-case

       then the following command

           RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH=wherever/.ripgreprc rg foo

       would behave identically to the following command:

           rg --smart-case foo

       Another example is adding types, like so:

           --type-add
           web:*.{html,css,js}*

       The above would behave identically to the following command:

           rg --type-add 'web:*.{html,css,js}*' foo

       The same applies to using globs. This:

           --glob=!.git

       or this:

           --glob
           !.git

       would behave identically to the following command:

           rg --glob '!.git' foo

       The  bottom  line is that every shell argument needs to be on its own line. So for example, a config file
       containing

           -j 4

       is probably not doing what you intend. Instead, you want

           -j
           4

       or

           -j4

       ripgrep also provides a flag, <b>--no-config</b>, that when present  will  suppress  any  and  all  support  for
       configuration.  This includes any future support for auto-loading configuration files from pre-determined
       paths.

       Conflicts between configuration files and explicit arguments are handled exactly like  conflicts  in  the
       same  command  line  invocation. That is, assuming your config file contains only <b>--smart-case</b>, then this
       command:

           RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH=wherever/.ripgreprc rg foo --case-sensitive

       is exactly equivalent to

           rg --smart-case foo --case-sensitive

       in which case, the <b>--case-sensitive</b> flag would override the <b>--smart-case</b> flag.

</pre><h4><b>SHELL</b> <b>COMPLETION</b></h4><pre>
       Shell completion files are included in the release tarball for Bash, Fish, Zsh and PowerShell.

       For <b>bash</b>, move <b>rg.bash</b> to <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bash_completion</b> or <b><a href="file:/etc/bash_completion.d/">/etc/bash_completion.d/</a></b>.

       For <b>fish</b>, move <b>rg.fish</b> to <b>$HOME/.config/fish/completions</b>.

       For <b>zsh</b>, move <b>_rg</b> to one of your <b>$fpath</b> directories.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       ripgrep may abort unexpectedly when using default settings if it searches a file that  is  simultaneously
       truncated.  This  behavior can be avoided by passing the <b>--no-mmap</b> flag which will forcefully disable the
       use of memory maps in all cases.

       ripgrep may use a large amount of memory depending on a few factors. Firstly, if ripgrep uses parallelism
       for search (the default), then the entire output for each individual file  is  buffered  into  memory  in
       order  to prevent interleaving matches in the output. To avoid this, you can disable parallelism with the
       <b>-j1</b> flag. Secondly, ripgrep always needs to have at least a single line in memory in order to  execute  a
       search.  A file with a very long line can thus cause ripgrep to use a lot of memory. Generally, this only
       occurs when searching binary data with the  <b>-a/--text</b>  flag  enabled.  (When  the  <b>-a/--text</b>  flag  isn't
       enabled,  ripgrep  will  replace all NUL bytes with line terminators, which typically prevents exorbitant
       memory usage.) Thirdly, when ripgrep searches a large file using a memory map, the  process  will  likely
       report  its  resident  memory usage as the size of the file. However, this does not mean ripgrep actually
       needed to use that much heap memory; the operating system will generally handle this for you.
