       treescan - scan directory trees, list dirs/files, stat, sync, grep

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          treescan [OPTION...] [PATH...]

             -q, --quiet    do not print list of files/directories
             -0, --print0   use null character instead of newline to separate names
             -s, --stat     call stat on every entry, to get stat data into cache
             -d, --dirs     only list dirs
             -f, --files    only list files
             -p, --progress regularly print progress to stderr
                 --sync     open/fsync/close every entry
             -g, --grep=RE  only list files that match the given perl RegEx

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>treescan</u> command scans directories and their contents recursively. By default it lists all files and
       directories (with trailing "/"), but it can optionally do various other things.

       If no paths are given, <u>treescan</u> will use ".", the current directory.

   <b>OPTIONS</b>
       -q, --quiet
           By default, <u>treescan</u> prints the full paths of all directories or files it finds. This option disables
           printing  of  filenames  completely.  This  is useful if you want to run <u>treescan</u> solely for its side
           effects, such as pulling "stat" data into memory.

       -0, --print0
           Instead of using newlines, use null characters after each filename. This is useful to  avoid  quoting
           problems  when piping the result into other programs (for example, GNU <u>grep</u>, <u>xargs</u> and so on all have
           options to deal with this).

       -s, --stat
           Normally, <u>treescan</u> will use heuristics to avoid most "stat" calls, which is what makes  it  so  fast.
           This option forces it to "stat" every file.

           This is only useful for the side effect of pulling the "stat" data into the cache. If your disk cache
           is  big  enough,  it  will  be  filled with file meta data after <u>treescan</u> is done, which can speed up
           subsequent commands considerably. Often, you can run  <u>treescan</u>  in  parallel  with  other  directory-
           scanning programs to speed them up.

       -d, --dirs
           Only  lists directories, not file paths. This is useful if you quickly want a list of directories and
           their subdirectories.

       -f, --files
           Only list files, not directories. This is useful if you want to operate on all files in a  hierarchy,
           and the directories would ony get in the way.

       -p, --progress
           Regularly  print  some  progress  information  to standard error. This is useful to get some progress
           information on long running tasks. Since the progress is printed to standard error, you can pipe  the
           output of <u>treescan</u> into other programs as usual.

       --sync
           The  "--sync"  option  can be used to make sure all the files/dirs in a tree are sync'ed to disk. For
           example this could be useful after unpacking an archive, to make sure the files hit the  disk  before
           deleting the archive file itself.

       -g, --grep=RE
           This  applies  a perl regular expression (see the perlre manpage) to all paths that would normally be
           printed and will only print matching paths.

           The regular expression uses an "/s" (single line) modifier by default, so  newlines  are  matched  by
           ".".
