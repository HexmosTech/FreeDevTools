       hg shelve - save and set aside changes from the working directory

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       hg shelve [OPTION]... [FILE]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Shelving  takes  files  that  "hg  status"  reports  as not clean, saves the modifications to a bundle (a
       shelved change), and reverts the files so that their state in the working directory becomes clean.

       To restore these changes to the working directory, using "hg unshelve"; this will work even if you switch
       to a different commit.

       When no files are specified, "hg shelve" saves all not-clean files. If specific files or directories  are
       named, only changes to those files are shelved.

       In  bare  shelve (when no files are specified, without interactive, include and exclude option), shelving
       remembers information if the working directory was on  newly  created  branch,  in  other  words  working
       directory  was  on  different  branch than its first parent. In this situation unshelving restores branch
       information to the working directory.

       Each shelved change has a name that makes it easier to find later.  The name of a shelved change defaults
       to being based on the active bookmark, or if there is no active bookmark, the current named  branch.   To
       specify a different name, use <b>--name</b>.

       To  see  a  list  of  existing shelved changes, use the <b>--list</b> option. For each shelved change, this will
       print its name, age, and description; use <b>--patch</b> or <b>--stat</b> for more details.

       To delete specific shelved changes, use <b>--delete</b>. To delete all shelved changes, use <b>--cleanup</b>.
