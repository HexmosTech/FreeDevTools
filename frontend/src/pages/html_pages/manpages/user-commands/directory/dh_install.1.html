</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dh_install - install files into package build directories

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dh_install</b> [<b>-X</b><u>item</u>] [<b>--autodest</b>] [<b>--sourcedir=</b><u>dir</u>] [<u>debhelper</u> <u>options</u>] [<u>file|dir</u> ... <u>destdir</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dh_install</b> is a debhelper program that handles installing files into package build directories. There are
       many <b>dh_install</b><u>*</u> commands that handle installing specific types of files such as documentation, examples,
       man pages, and so on, and they should be used when possible as they often have extra intelligence for
       those particular tasks. <b>dh_install</b>, then, is useful for installing everything else, for which no
       particular intelligence is needed. It is a replacement for the old <b>dh_movefiles</b> command.

       This program may be used in one of two ways. If you just have a file or two that the upstream Makefile
       does not install for you, you can run <b>dh_install</b> on them to move them into place. On the other hand,
       maybe you have a large package that builds multiple binary packages. You can use the upstream <u>Makefile</u> to
       install it all into <u>debian/tmp</u>, and then use <b>dh_install</b> to copy directories and files from there into the
       proper package build directories.

       From debhelper compatibility level 7 on, <b>dh_install</b> will fall back to looking in <u>debian/tmp</u> for files, if
       it does not find them in the current directory (or wherever you've told it to look using <b>--sourcedir</b>).

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       debian/<u>package</u>.install
           List the files to install into each package and the directory they should be installed to. The format
           is a set of lines, where each line lists a file or files to install, and at the end of the line tells
           the  directory it should be installed in. The name of the files (or directories) to install should be
           given relative to the current directory, while the installation directory is given  relative  to  the
           package build directory. You may use wildcards in the names of the files to install.

           Note  that if you list exactly one filename or wildcard-pattern on a line by itself, with no explicit
           destination, then <b>dh_install</b> will automatically guess the destination to use,  the  same  as  if  the
           --autodest option were used.

           Supports substitution variables in compat 13 and later as documented in <b><a href="../man7/debhelper.7.html">debhelper</a></b>(7).

       debian/not-installed
           Used  with  the  deprecated <b>--list-missing</b> and <b>--fail-missing</b> options.  Please refer to <b><a href="../man1/dh_missing.1.html">dh_missing</a></b>(1)
           for the documentation of this file.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--list-missing</b>
           <b>Deprecated</b>: Please use <b>dh_missing</b> <b>--list-missing</b> instead.  If you use this  option,  <b>dh_install</b>  will
           call  <b>dh_missing</b> with that option after it has processed all the files.  Please see <b><a href="../man1/dh_missing.1.html">dh_missing</a></b>(1) for
           the documentation of this option.

           This option is removed in compat 12.

       <b>--fail-missing</b>
           <b>Deprecated</b>: Please use <b>dh_missing</b> <b>--fail-missing</b> instead.  If you use this  option,  <b>dh_install</b>  will
           call  <b>dh_missing</b> with that option after it has processed all the files.  Please see <b><a href="../man1/dh_missing.1.html">dh_missing</a></b>(1) for
           the documentation of this option.

           This option is removed in compat 12.

       <b>--sourcedir=</b><u>dir</u>
           Look in the specified directory for files to be installed.

           Note that this is not the same as the <b>--sourcedirectory</b> option used by the  <b>dh_auto_</b><u>*</u>  commands.  You
           rarely  need  to  use  this  option,  since <b>dh_install</b> automatically looks for files in <u>debian/tmp</u> in
           debhelper compatibility level 7 and above.

       <b>--autodest</b>
           Guess as the destination directory to install things to. If this is specified, you  should  not  list
           destination  directories  in <u>debian/package.install</u> files or on the command line. Instead, <b>dh_install</b>
           will guess as follows:

           Strip off <u>debian/tmp</u> (or the sourcedir if one is given) from the front of  the  filename,  if  it  is
           present, and install into the dirname of the filename. So if the filename is <u>debian/tmp/usr/bin</u>, then
           that  directory  will  be copied to <u>debian/package/usr/</u>. If the filename is <u>debian/tmp/etc/passwd</u>, it
           will be copied to <u>debian/package/etc/</u>.

       <u>file|dir</u> ... <u>destdir</u>
           Lists files (or directories) to install and where to install them to.  The files  will  be  installed
           into the first package <u>dh_install</u> acts on.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Here are some small examples of configuration files for dh_install.

           # Install my-prog into usr/bin (as "usr/bin/my-prog")
           my-prog usr/bin

           # Install a plugins directory into usr/share/my-prog
           # (as "usr/share/my-prog/plugins/")
           plugins usr/share/my-prog

           # Install a file with spaces in into usr/share/my-prog/data
           # (as "usr/share/my-prog/data/my datafile with spaces.txt")
           # ASSUMES COMPAT 13, where substitution patterns are available
           my${Space}datafile${Space}with${Space}spaces.txt usr/share/my-prog/data

           # Install a library into the multi-arch lib directory
           # ASSUMES COMPAT 13, where substitution patterns are available
           build/output/libfrop*.so.* usr/lib/${DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH}

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dh_install</b>  cannot rename files or directories, it can only install them with the names they already have
       into wherever you want in the package build tree.

       There is also no way to filter out results based on build profiles  or  architecture.  For  documentation
       content, consider using <b>dh_installdocs</b> or <b>dh_installexamples</b> as those helpers account for the <b>nodoc</b> build
       profile.

       However, renaming and filtering can be achieved by using <b>dh-exec</b> with compatibility level 9 or later.  An
       example debian/<u>package</u>.install file using <b>dh-exec</b> could look like:

        #!/usr/bin/dh-exec
        debian/default.conf =&gt; /etc/my-package/start.conf
        build/foo <a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a> &lt;!pkg.bar.nofoo&gt;

       Please remember the following three things:

       •   The package must be using compatibility level 9 or later (see <b><a href="../man7/debhelper.7.html">debhelper</a></b>(7))

       •   The package will need a build-dependency on dh-exec.

       •   The install file must be marked as executable.
