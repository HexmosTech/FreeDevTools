</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gpgdir</b> - recursive directory encryption with GnuPG

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gpgdir</b> <b>-e|-d</b> <b>&lt;directory&gt;</b> <b>[options]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gpgdir</b>  is  a  perl  script  that  uses  the CPAN GnuPG::Interface perl module to recursively encrypt and
       decrypt directories using gpg.  <b>gpgdir</b> recursively descends through a directory in order to make sure  it
       encrypts  or  decrypts every file in a directory and all of its subdirectories.  By default the mtime and
       atime values of all files will be preserved upon encryption and decryption (this can be disabled with the
       <b>--no-preserve-times</b> option).  Note that in <b>--encrypt</b> mode, gpgdir will delete the original files that  it
       successfully  encrypts (unless the <b>--no-delete</b> option is given).  However, upon startup gpgdir first asks
       for a the decryption password to be sure that a dummy file can successfully be encrypted  and  decrypted.
       The  initial test can be disabled with the <b>--skip-test</b> option so that a directory can easily be encrypted
       without having to also specify a password (this is consistent with <b>gpg</b> behavior).  Also, note that gpgdir
       is careful not encrypt hidden files and directories.  After all, you probably don't  want  your  <a href="file:~/.gnupg">~/.gnupg</a>
       directory  or  <a href="file:~/.bashrc">~/.bashrc</a>  file  to  be  encrypted.  The key <b>gpgdir</b> uses to encrypt/decrypt a directory is
       specified in <a href="file:~/.gpgdirrc.">~/.gpgdirrc.</a>

       Finally, <b>gpgdir</b> can use the <b>wipe</b> program with the <b>--Wipe</b> command  line  option  to  securely  delete  the
       original  unencrypted  files  after  they  have  been successfully encrypted.  This elevates the security
       stance of gpgdir since it is more difficult to recover the unencrypted data associated  with  files  from
       the  filesystem  after  they  are  encrypted  (unlink()  does not erase data blocks even though a file is
       removed).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-e</b>, <b>--encrypt</b> <b>&lt;directory&gt;</b>
              Recursively encrypt all files in the directory specified on the command line.  All original  files
              will  be  deleted  (a  password check is performed first to make sure that the correct password to
              unlock the private GnuPG key is known to the user).

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--decrypt</b> <b>&lt;directory&gt;</b>
              Recursively decrypt all files in the directory specified on the command line.  The encrypted  .gpg
              version of each file will be deleted.

       <b>--sign</b> <b>&lt;directory&gt;</b>
              Recursively  sign  all  files  in  the  directory specified on the command line.  For each file, a
              detached .asc signature will be created.

       <b>--verify</b> <b>&lt;directory&gt;</b>
              Recursively verify all .asc signatures for files in the directory specified on the command line.

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--gnupg-dir</b> <b>&lt;directory&gt;</b>
              Specify which .gnupg directory will be used to find GnuPG keys.  The default is <a href="file:~/.gnupg">~/.gnupg</a>  if  this
              option  is  not used.  This option allows gpgdir to be run as one user but use the keys of another
              user (assuming permissions are setup correctly, etc.).

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--pw-file</b> <b>&lt;pw-file&gt;</b>
              Read decryption password from <b>pw-file</b> instead of typing it on the command line.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--test-mode</b>
              Run an encryption and decryption test against a dummy file and exit.  This test is always  run  by
              default in both <b>--encrypt</b> and <b>--decrypt</b> mode.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--Symmetric</b>
              Instruct  <b>gpgdir</b> to encrypt to decrypt files using a symmetric cipher supported by GnuPG (CAST5 is
              commonly used).  This results in a significant speed up for the encryption/decryption process.

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--Trial-run</b>
              Show what encrypt/decrypt actions would take place without actually doing them.  The filesystem is
              not changed in any way in this mode.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--Interactive</b>
              Prompt the user before actually encrypting or decrypting each file.  This is useful to have  fine-
              grained control over <b>gpgdir</b> operations as it recurses through a directory structure.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--Force</b>
              Tell  <b>gpgdir</b>  to  ignore  non-fatal  error conditions, such as the inability to encrypt or decrypt
              individual files because of permissions errors.

       <b>--Exclude</b> <b>&lt;pattern&gt;</b>
              Instruct gpgdir to skip all files that match <b>pattern</b> as a regex match against each filename.  This
              is similar to the <b>--exclude</b> option in the standard GNU tar command.

       <b>--Exclude-from</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Instruct gpgdir to exclude all files matched by patterns listed in <b>file.</b>  This is similar  to  the
              <b>--exclude-from</b> the GNU tar command.

       <b>--Include</b> <b>&lt;pattern&gt;</b>
              Instruct gpgdir to only include files that match <b>pattern</b> as a regex match against each filename.

       <b>--Include-from</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Instruct gpgdir to only include files matched by patterns listed in <b>file.</b>

       <b>-W</b>, <b>--Wipe</b>
              Use the <b>wipe</b> program to securely delete files after they have been successfully encrypted.

       <b>-O</b>, <b>--Obfuscate-filename</b>
              Tell <b>gpgdir</b> to obfuscate the file names of files that it encrypts (in -e mode).  The names of each
              file  are stored within the file .gpgdir_map_file for every sub-directory, and this file is itself
              encrypted.  In decryption mode (-d), the -O argument reverses the process  so  that  the  original
              files are restored.

       <b>--overwrite-encrypted</b>
              Overwrite encrypted files even if a previous &lt;file&gt;.gpg file already exists.

       <b>--overwrite-decrypted</b>
              Overwrite decrypted files even if the previous unencrypted file already exists.

       <b>-K</b>, <b>--Key-id</b> <b>&lt;id&gt;</b>
              Manually  specify a GnuPG key ID from the command line.  Because GnuPG supports matching keys with
              a string, <b>id</b> does not strictly have to be a key ID; it can be a string that uniquely matches a key
              in the GnuPG key ring.

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--Default-key</b>
              Use the key that GnuPG defines as the default, i.e. the key that is specified by  the  <b>default-key</b>
              variable in <a href="file:~/.gnupg/options.">~/.gnupg/options.</a>  If the default-key variable is not defined within <a href="file:~/.gnupg/options">~/.gnupg/options</a>,
              then  GnuPG  tries to use the first suitable key on its key ring (the initial encrypt/decrypt test
              makes sure that the user knows the corresponding password for the key).

       <b>-a</b>,  <b>--agent</b>
              Instruct <b>gpgdir</b> to acquire gpg key password from a running <b>gpg-agent</b> instance.

       <b>-A</b>, <b>--Agent-info</b> <b>&lt;connection</b> <b>info&gt;</b>
              Specify the value of the GPG_AGENT_INFO environment variable as returned by the <b>gpg-agent</b> <b>--daemon</b>
              command. If the <b>gpgdir</b> <b>--agent</b> command line argument is used instead of <b>--Agent-info,</b> then  gpgdir
              assumes that the GPG_AGENT_INFO environment variable has already been set in the current shell.

       <b>-s</b>,  <b>--skip-test</b>
              Skip  encryption  and  decryption  test.  This will allow <b>gpgdir</b> to be used to encrypt a directory
              without specifying a password (which normally gets used in encryption mode to test  to  make  sure
              decryption against a dummy file works properly).

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
              Print as little as possible to the screen when encrypting or decrypting a directory.

       <b>--no-recurse</b>
              Instruct gpgdir to not recurse through any subdirectories of the directory that is being encrypted
              or decrypted.

       <b>--no-password</b>
              Instruct  gpgdir to not ask the user for a password.  This is only useful when a gpg key literally
              has no associated password (this is not common).

       <b>--no-delete</b>
              Instruct gpgdir to not delete original files at encrypt time.

       <b>--no-preserve</b>times
              Instruct gpgdir to  not  preserve  original  file  mtime  and  atime  values  upon  encryption  or
              decryption.

       <b>-l</b>,  <b>--locale</b> <b>&lt;locale&gt;</b>
              Provide a locale setting other than the default "C" locale.

       <b>--no-locale</b>
              Do not set the locale at all so that the default system locale will apply.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Run in verbose mode.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--Version</b>
              Print version number and exit.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print usage information and exit.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="file:~/.gpgdirrc">~/.gpgdirrc</a></b>
              Contains the key id of the user gpg key that will be used to encrypt or decrypt the files within a
              directory.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <u>HOME</u>         Set the default home directory.

       <u>GNUPGBIN</u>     Set the gpg binary.  Default: "gpg".

       <u>GNUPGHOME</u>    Set the default working directory for gpg.  Default: "<a href="file:~/.gnupg">~/.gnupg</a>".

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  examples  illustrate the command line arguments that could be supplied to gpgdir in a few
       situations:

       To encrypt a directory:

       <b>$</b> <b>gpgdir</b> <b>-e</b> <b>/some/dir</b>

       To encrypt a directory, and use the wipe command to securely delete the original unencrypted files:

       <b>$</b> <b>gpgdir</b> <b>-W</b> <b>-e</b> <b>/some/dir</b>

       To encrypt a directory with the default GnuPG key defined in <a href="file:~/.gnupg/options">~/.gnupg/options</a>:

       <b>$</b> <b>gpgdir</b> <b>-e</b> <b>/some/dir</b> <b>--Default-key</b>

       To decrypt a directory with a key specified in <a href="file:~/.gpgdirrc">~/.gpgdirrc</a>:

       <b>$</b> <b>gpgdir</b> <b>-d</b> <b>/some/dir</b>

       To encrypt a directory but skip all filenames that contain the string "host":

       <b>$</b> <b>gpgdir</b> <b>-e</b> <b>/some/dir</b> <b>--Exclude</b> <b>host</b>

       To encrypt a directory but only encrypt those files that contain the string "passwd":

       <b>$</b> <b>gpgdir</b> <b>-e</b> <b>/some/dir</b> <b>--Include</b> <b>passwd</b>

       To acquire the GnuPG key password from a running gpg-agent daemon in order to decrypt a  directory  (this
       requires that gpg-agent has the password):

       <b>$</b> <b>gpgdir</b> <b>-A</b> <b>/tmp/gpg-H4DBhc/S.gpg-agent:7046:1</b> <b>-d</b> <b>/some/dir</b>

       To  encrypt  a  directory  but  skip  the  encryption/decryption  test (so you will not be prompted for a
       decryption password):

       <b>$</b> <b>gpgdir</b> <b>-e</b> <b>/some/dir</b> <b>-s</b>

       To encrypt a directory and no subdirectories:

       <b>$</b> <b>gpgdir</b> <b>-e</b> <b>/some/dir</b> <b>--no-recurse</b>

       To encrypt root's home directory, but use the GnuPG keys associated with the user "bob":

       <b>#</b> <b>gpgdir</b> <b>-e</b> <b><a href="file:/root">/root</a></b> <b>-g</b> <b>/home/bob/.gnupg</b>

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gpgdir</b> requires that gpg, the  Gnu  Privacy  Guard  (<a href="http://www.gnupg.org">http://www.gnupg.org</a>)  is  installed.   <b>gpgdir</b>  also
       requires  the  GnuPG::Interface  perl module from CPAN, but it is bundled with <b>gpgdir</b> and is installed in
       /usr/lib/gpgdir at install-time so it does not pollute the system perl library tree.
