       fls - List file and directory names in a disk image.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fls</b>  <b>[-adDFlpruvV]</b>  <b>[-m</b>  <u>mnt</u>  <b>]</b>  <b>[-z</b>  <u>zone</u> <b>]</b> <b>[-f</b> <u>fstype</u> <b>]</b> <b>[-s</b> <u>seconds</u> <b>]</b> <b>[-i</b> <u>imgtype</u> <b>]</b> <b>[-o</b> <u>imgoffset</u> <b>]</b> <b>[-b</b>
       <b>dev_sector_size]</b> <u>image</u> <u>[images]</u> <b>[</b> <u>inode</u> <b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fls</b> lists the files and directory names in the <u>image</u> and can display file names of recently deleted files
       for the directory using the given <u>inode.</u>  If the inode argument is not given, the  inode  value  for  the
       root  directory  is  used. For example, on an NTFS file system it would be 5 and on a Ext3 file system it
       would be 2.

       The arguments are as follows:

       -a     Display the "." and ".." directory entries (by default it does not)

       -d     Display deleted entries only

       -D     Display directory entries only

       -f fstype
              The type of file system.  Use '-f list' to list the supported file system types.   If  not  given,
              autodetection methods are used.

       -F     Display file (all non-directory) entries only.

       -l     Display file details in long format.  The following contents are displayed:

              file_type inode file_name mod_time acc_time chg_time cre_time size uid gid

       -m mnt Display  files  in time machine format so that a timeline can be     created with <a href="../man1/mactime.1.html">mactime</a>(1).  The
              string given as <u>mnt</u> will be prepended to the file names as the mounting point (for example <a href="file:/usr">/usr</a>).

       -p     Display the full path for each entry.  By default it denotes the directory depth on recursive runs
              with a '+' sign.

       -r     Recursively display directories.  This will not follow deleted directories, because it can't.

       -s seconds
              The time skew of the original system in seconds.  For example, if  the  original  system  was  100
              seconds slow, this value would be -100.  This is only used if -l or -m are given.

       -i imgtype
              Identify  the type of image file, such as raw.  Use '-i list' to list the supported types.  If not
              given, autodetection methods are used.

       -o imgoffset
              The sector offset where the file system starts in the image.

       -b dev_sector_size
              The size, in bytes, of the underlying device sectors.  If not given, the value in the image format
              is used (if it exists) or 512-bytes is assumed.

       -u     Display undeleted entries only

       -v     Verbose output to stderr.

       -V     Display version.

       -z zone
              The ASCII string of the time zone of the original system.  For example, EST or GMT.  These strings
              must be defined by your operating system and may vary.

       image [images]
              The disk or partition image to read, whose format is given with '-i'.  Multiple image  file  names
              can  be  given if the image is split into multiple segments.  If only one image file is given, and
              its name is the first in a sequence (e.g., as indicated by ending  in  '.001'),  subsequent  image
              segments will be included automatically.

       Once  the  inode  has been determined, the file can be recovered using <b><a href="../man1/icat.1.html">icat</a>(1)</b> from The Coroners Toolkit.
       The amount of information recovered from deleted file  entries  varies  depending  on  the  system.   For
       example,  on  Linux, a recently deleted file can be easily recovered, while in Solaris not even the inode
       can be determined.  If you just want to find what file name belongs to an inode,  it  is  easier  to  use
       <b><a href="../man1/ffind.1.html">ffind</a>(1).</b>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To get a list of all files and directories in an image use:

            # fls -r image 2

            or just (if no inode is specified, the root directory inode is used):

            # fls -r image

       To get the full path of deleted files in a given directory:

            # fls -d -p image 29

       To get the mactime output do:

            # fls -m <a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a> image 2

       If you have a disk image and the file system starts in sector 63, use:

            # fls -o 63 disk-img.dd

       If you have a disk image that is split use:

            # fls -i "split" -o 63 disk-1.dd disk-2.dd disk-3.dd
