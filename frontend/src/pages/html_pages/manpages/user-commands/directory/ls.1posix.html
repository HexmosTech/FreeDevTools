</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ls — list directory contents

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       ls <b>[</b>-ikqrs<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-glno<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-A|-a<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-C|-m|-x|-1<b>]</b> \
           <b>[</b>-F|-p<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-H|-L<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-R|-d<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-S|-f|-t<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-c|-u<b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>file</u>...<b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       For  each  operand  that  names a file of a type other than directory or symbolic link to a directory, <u>ls</u>
       shall write the name of the file as well as any requested, associated information. For each operand  that
       names  a file of type directory, <u>ls</u> shall write the names of files contained within the directory as well
       as any requested, associated information. Filenames beginning with a &lt;period&gt; (<b>'.'</b>)  and  any  associated
       information shall not be written out unless explicitly referenced, the <b>-A</b> or <b>-a</b> option is supplied, or an
       implementation-defined  condition  causes them to be written. If one or more of the <b>-d</b>, <b>-F</b>, or <b>-l</b> options
       are specified, and neither the <b>-H</b> nor the <b>-L</b> option is specified, for each operand that names a  file  of
       type  symbolic  link  to  a  directory,  <u>ls</u>  shall  write  the name of the file as well as any requested,
       associated information. If none of the <b>-d</b>, <b>-F</b>, or <b>-l</b> options are specified, or the <b>-H</b> or <b>-L</b>  options  are
       specified,  for  each  operand that names a file of type symbolic link to a directory, <u>ls</u> shall write the
       names of files contained within the directory as well as any requested, associated information.  In  each
       case  where  the  names  of files contained within a directory are written, if the directory contains any
       symbolic links then <u>ls</u> shall evaluate the file information and file type to be those of the symbolic link
       itself, unless the <b>-L</b> option is specified.

       If no operands are specified, <u>ls</u> shall behave as if a single operand of dot (<b>'.'</b>)  had been specified. If
       more than one operand is specified, <u>ls</u> shall write non-directory operands first; it shall sort  directory
       and non-directory operands separately according to the collating sequence in the current locale.

       Whenever  <u>ls</u>  sorts  filenames or pathnames according to the collating sequence in the current locale, if
       this collating sequence does not have a total ordering of all characters (see the Base Definitions volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>7.3.2</u>, <u>LC_COLLATE</u>), then any filenames or pathnames that collate equally  should
       be further compared byte-by-byte using the collating sequence for the POSIX locale.

       The  <u>ls</u>  utility shall detect infinite loops; that is, entering a previously visited directory that is an
       ancestor of the last file encountered.  When it detects an infinite loop, <u>ls</u>  shall  write  a  diagnostic
       message to standard error and shall either recover its position in the hierarchy or terminate.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>ls</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>12.2</u>, <u>Utility</u> <u>Syntax</u>
       <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-A</b>        Write  out  all directory entries, including those whose names begin with a &lt;period&gt; (<b>'.'</b>)  but
                 excluding the entries dot and dot-dot (if they exist).

       <b>-C</b>        Write multi-text-column output with entries sorted down the columns, according to the collating
                 sequence. The number of text columns and the column separator characters are  unspecified,  but
                 should be adapted to the nature of the output device. This option disables long format output.

       <b>-F</b>        Do not follow symbolic links named as operands unless the <b>-H</b> or <b>-L</b> options are specified. Write
                 a  &lt;slash&gt; (<b>'/'</b>) immediately after each pathname that is a directory, an &lt;asterisk&gt; (<b>'*'</b>) after
                 each that is executable, a &lt;vertical-line&gt; (<b>'|'</b>) after each that is  a  FIFO,  and  an  at-sign
                 (<b>'@'</b>) after each that is a symbolic link. For other file types, other symbols may be written.

       <b>-H</b>        Evaluate the file information and file type for symbolic links specified on the command line to
                 be  those  of the file referenced by the link, and not the link itself; however, <u>ls</u> shall write
                 the name of the link itself and not the file referenced by the link.

       <b>-L</b>        Evaluate the file information and file type for  all  symbolic  links  (whether  named  on  the
                 command  line  or  encountered  in  a file hierarchy) to be those of the file referenced by the
                 link, and not the link itself; however, <u>ls</u> shall write the name of the link itself and not  the
                 file  referenced  by the link. When <b>-L</b> is used with <b>-l</b>, write the contents of symbolic links in
                 the long format (see the STDOUT section).

       <b>-R</b>        Recursively  list  subdirectories  encountered.  When  a  symbolic  link  to  a  directory   is
                 encountered,  the  directory shall not be recursively listed unless the <b>-L</b> option is specified.
                 The use of <b>-R</b> with <b>-d</b> or <b>-f</b> produces unspecified results.

       <b>-S</b>        Sort with the primary key being file size (in decreasing order) and  the  secondary  key  being
                 filename in the collating sequence (in increasing order).

       <b>-a</b>        Write out all directory entries, including those whose names begin with a &lt;period&gt; (<b>'.'</b>).

       <b>-c</b>        Use  time  of last modification of the file status information (see the Base Definitions volume
                 of POSIX.1‐2017, <b>&lt;sys_stat.h&gt;</b>) instead of last modification of the file itself for sorting (<b>-t</b>)
                 or writing (<b>-l</b>).

       <b>-d</b>        Do not follow symbolic links named as operands unless the <b>-H</b> or <b>-L</b> options  are  specified.  Do
                 not  treat  directories  differently  than  other  types  of files. The use of <b>-d</b> with <b>-R</b> or <b>-f</b>
                 produces unspecified results.

       <b>-f</b>        List the entries in directory operands in the order they appear in the directory. The  behavior
                 for non-directory operands is unspecified. This option shall turn on <b>-a</b>.  When <b>-f</b> is specified,
                 any  occurrences  of the <b>-r</b>, <b>-S</b>, and <b>-t</b> options shall be ignored and any occurrences of the <b>-A</b>,
                 <b>-g</b>, <b>-l</b>, <b>-n</b>, <b>-o</b>, and <b>-s</b> options may be ignored. The use of <b>-f</b> with <b>-R</b> or <b>-d</b> produces unspecified
                 results.

       <b>-g</b>        Turn on the <b>-l</b> (ell) option, but disable writing the file's owner name or number.  Disable  the
                 <b>-C</b>, <b>-m</b>, and <b>-x</b> options.

       <b>-i</b>        For  each file, write the file's file serial number (see <u>stat</u>() in the System Interfaces volume
                 of POSIX.1‐2017).

       <b>-k</b>        Set the block size for the <b>-s</b> option and the per-directory block count written for the <b>-l</b>,  <b>-n</b>,
                 <b>-s</b>, <b>-g</b>, and <b>-o</b> options (see the STDOUT section) to 1024 bytes.

       <b>-l</b>        (The  letter  ell.)  Do not follow symbolic links named as operands unless the <b>-H</b> or <b>-L</b> options
                 are specified. Write out in long format (see the STDOUT section). Disable the <b>-C</b>,  <b>-m</b>,  and  <b>-x</b>
                 options.

       <b>-m</b>        Stream output format; list pathnames across the page, separated by a &lt;comma&gt; character followed
                 by  a  &lt;space&gt;  character.  Use  a  &lt;newline&gt;  character  as  the list terminator and after the
                 separator sequence when there is not room on a line  for  the  next  list  entry.  This  option
                 disables long format output.

       <b>-n</b>        Turn  on  the  <b>-l</b>  (ell)  option,  but when writing the file's owner or group, write the file's
                 numeric UID or GID rather than the user or group name, respectively. Disable the <b>-C</b>, <b>-m</b>, and <b>-x</b>
                 options.

       <b>-o</b>        Turn on the <b>-l</b> (ell) option, but disable writing the file's group name or number.  Disable  the
                 <b>-C</b>, <b>-m</b>, and <b>-x</b> options.

       <b>-p</b>        Write a &lt;slash&gt; (<b>'/'</b>) after each filename if that file is a directory.

       <b>-q</b>        Force  each instance of non-printable filename characters and &lt;tab&gt; characters to be written as
                 the &lt;question-mark&gt; (<b>'?'</b>)  character. Implementations may provide this option by default if the
                 output is to a terminal device.

       <b>-r</b>        Reverse the order of the sort to get reverse collating sequence oldest first, or smallest  file
                 size first depending on the other options given.

       <b>-s</b>        Indicate  the  total  number  of  file system blocks consumed by each file displayed. If the <b>-k</b>
                 option is also specified, the block size shall be 1024 bytes;  otherwise,  the  block  size  is
                 implementation-defined.

       <b>-t</b>        Sort  with the primary key being time modified (most recently modified first) and the secondary
                 key being filename in the collating sequence.  For a symbolic link, the time used as  the  sort
                 key  is  that  of  the symbolic link itself, unless <u>ls</u> is evaluating its file information to be
                 that of the file referenced by the link (see the <b>-H</b> and <b>-L</b> options).

       <b>-u</b>        Use time of last access (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <b>&lt;sys_stat.h&gt;</b>) instead
                 of last modification of the file for sorting (<b>-t</b>) or writing (<b>-l</b>).

       <b>-x</b>        The same as <b>-C</b>, except that the  multi-text-column  output  is  produced  with  entries  sorted
                 across, rather than down, the columns. This option disables long format output.

       <b>-1</b>        (The  numeric  digit one.) Force output to be one entry per line.  This option does not disable
                 long format output. (Long format output is enabled by <b>-g</b>, <b>-l</b> (ell), <b>-n</b>, and <b>-o</b>; and disabled by
                 <b>-C</b>, <b>-m</b>, and <b>-x</b>.)

       If an option that enables long format output (<b>-g</b>, <b>-l</b> (ell), <b>-n</b>, and <b>-o</b>  is  given  with  an  option  that
       disables  long  format  output (<b>-C</b>, <b>-m</b>, and <b>-x</b>), this shall not be considered an error. The last of these
       options specified shall determine whether long format output is written.

       If <b>-R</b>, <b>-d</b>, or <b>-f</b> are specified, the results of specifying these mutually-exclusive options are  specified
       by  the  descriptions  of  these options above. If more than one of any of the other options shown in the
       SYNOPSIS section in mutually-exclusive sets are given, this shall not be considered an  error;  the  last
       option specified in each set shall determine the output.

       Note  that  if  <b>-t</b> is specified, <b>-c</b> and <b>-u</b> are not only mutually-exclusive with each other, they are also
       mutually-exclusive with <b>-S</b> when determining sort order. But even if <b>-S</b> is specified after all occurrences
       of <b>-c</b>, <b>-t</b>, and <b>-u</b>, the last use of <b>-c</b> or <b>-u</b> determines the timestamp printed when producing  long  format
       output.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <u>file</u>      A  pathname  of  a file to be written. If the file specified is not found, a diagnostic message
                 shall be output on standard error.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>ls</u>:

       <u>COLUMNS</u>   Determine the user's preferred column position width for writing multiple  text-column  output.
                 If  this  variable  contains  a  string  representing  a  decimal integer, the <u>ls</u> utility shall
                 calculate how many pathname text columns to write (see <b>-C</b>) based  on  the  width  provided.  If
                 <u>COLUMNS</u>  is  not  set or invalid, an implementation-defined number of column positions shall be
                 assumed, based on the implementation's knowledge of the output device. The column width  chosen
                 to  write  the  names of files in any given directory shall be constant. Filenames shall not be
                 truncated to fit into the multiple text-column output.

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u>  <u>Variables</u>  for  the
                 precedence   of   internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values  of  locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the  other  internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_COLLATE</u>
                 Determine  the locale for character collation information in determining the pathname collation
                 sequence.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for  example,  single-byte  as  opposed  to  multi-byte  characters  in  arguments)  and which
                 characters are defined as printable (character class <b>print</b>).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to  affect  the  format  and  contents  of  diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>LC_TIME</u>   Determine the format and contents for date and time strings written by <u>ls</u>.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

       <u>TZ</u>        Determine  the  timezone  for  date and time strings written by <u>ls</u>.  If <u>TZ</u> is unset or null, an
                 unspecified default timezone shall be used.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       The default format shall be to list one entry  per  line  to  standard  output;  the  exceptions  are  to
       terminals  or  when  one  of  the <b>-C</b>, <b>-m</b>, or <b>-x</b> options is specified. If the output is to a terminal, the
       format is implementation-defined.

       When <b>-m</b> is specified, the format used for the last element of the list shall be:

           "%s\n", &lt;<u>filename</u>&gt;

       The format used for each other element of the list shall be:

           "%s,%s", &lt;<u>filename</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>separator</u>&gt;

       where, if there is not room for the next element of the list to  fit  within  the  current  line  length,
       &lt;<u>separator</u>&gt;  is  a  string  containing an optional &lt;space&gt; character and a mandatory &lt;newline&gt; character;
       otherwise it is a single &lt;space&gt; character.

       If the <b>-i</b> option is specified, the file's  file  serial  number  (see  the  Base  Definitions  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017,  <b>&lt;sys_stat.h&gt;</b>)  shall  be  written  in the following format before any other output for the
       corresponding entry:

           %u ", &lt;<u>file</u> <u>serial</u> <u>number</u>&gt;

       If the <b>-l</b> option is specified, the following information shall be written for files other than  character
       special and block special files:

           "%s %u %s %s %u %s %s\n", &lt;<u>file</u> <u>mode</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>number</u> <u>of</u> <u>links</u>&gt;,
               &lt;<u>owner</u> <u>name</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>group</u> <u>name</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>size</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>date</u> <u>and</u> <u>time</u>&gt;,
               &lt;<u>pathname</u>&gt;

       If the <b>-l</b> option is specified, the following information shall be written for character special and block
       special files:

           "%s %u %s %s %s %s %s\n", &lt;<u>file</u> <u>mode</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>number</u> <u>of</u> <u>links</u>&gt;,
               &lt;<u>owner</u> <u>name</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>group</u> <u>name</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>device</u> <u>info</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>date</u> <u>and</u> <u>time</u>&gt;,
               &lt;<u>pathname</u>&gt;

       In  both cases if the file is a symbolic link and the <b>-L</b> option is also specified, this information shall
       be for the file resolved from the symbolic link, except that  the  &lt;<u>pathname</u>&gt;  field  shall  contain  the
       pathname  of the symbolic link itself. If the file is a symbolic link and the <b>-L</b> option is not specified,
       this information shall be about the link itself and the &lt;<u>pathname</u>&gt; field shall be of the form:

           "%s -&gt; %s", &lt;<u>pathname</u> <u>of</u> <u>link</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>contents</u> <u>of</u> <u>link</u>&gt;

       The <b>-n</b>, <b>-g</b>, and <b>-o</b> options use the same format as <b>-l</b>, but with omitted items and their associated &lt;blank&gt;
       characters. See the OPTIONS section.

       In both the preceding <b>-l</b> forms, if &lt;<u>owner</u> <u>name</u>&gt; or &lt;<u>group</u> <u>name</u>&gt; cannot be determined, or if <b>-n</b> is  given,
       they shall be replaced with their associated numeric values using the format <b>%u</b>.

       The  &lt;<u>size</u>&gt;  field  shall  contain  the value that would be returned for the file in the <u>st_size</u> field of
       <b>struct</b> <b>stat</b> (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <b>&lt;sys_stat.h&gt;</b>).  Note  that  for  some  file
       types this value is unspecified.

       The  &lt;<u>device</u> <u>info</u>&gt;  field  shall contain implementation-defined information associated with the device in
       question.

       The &lt;<u>date</u> <u>and</u> <u>time</u>&gt; field shall contain the appropriate date and timestamp of  when  the  file  was  last
       modified.  In  the  POSIX  locale,  the field shall be the equivalent of the output of the following <u>date</u>
       command:

           date "+%b %e %H:%M"

       if the file has been modified in the last six months, or:

           date "+%b %e %Y"

       (where two &lt;space&gt; characters are used between <b>%e</b> and <b>%Y</b>) if the file has not been modified in  the  last
       six  months or if the modification date is in the future, except that, in both cases, the final &lt;newline&gt;
       produced by <u>date</u> shall not be included and the output shall be as if the <u>date</u> command  were  executed  at
       the  time of the last modification date of the file rather than the current time. When the <u>LC_TIME</u> locale
       category is not set to the POSIX locale, a different format and order of presentation of this  field  may
       be used.

       If the pathname was specified as a <u>file</u> operand, it shall be written as specified.

       The file mode written under the <b>-l</b>, <b>-n</b>, <b>-g</b>, and <b>-o</b> options shall consist of the following format:

           "%c%s%s%s%s", &lt;<u>entry</u> <u>type</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>owner</u> <u>permissions</u>&gt;,
               &lt;<u>group</u> <u>permissions</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>other</u> <u>permissions</u>&gt;,
               &lt;<u>optional</u> <u>alternate</u> <u>access</u> <u>method</u> <u>flag</u>&gt;

       The  &lt;<u>optional</u> <u>alternate</u> <u>access</u> <u>method</u> <u>flag</u>&gt;  shall  be  the  empty  string  if  there is no alternate or
       additional access control method associated with the file; otherwise, it shall be a string  containing  a
       single printable character that is not a &lt;blank&gt;.

       The &lt;<u>entry</u> <u>type</u>&gt; character shall describe the type of file, as follows:

       d       Directory.

       b       Block special file.

       c       Character special file.

       l (ell) Symbolic link.

       p       FIFO.

       -       Regular file.

       Implementations  may  add  other  characters  to this list to represent other implementation-defined file
       types.

       The next three fields shall be three characters each:

       &lt;<u>owner</u> <u>permissions</u>&gt;
             Permissions for the file owner class (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>4.5</u>,
             <u>File</u> <u>Access</u> <u>Permissions</u>).

       &lt;<u>group</u> <u>permissions</u>&gt;
             Permissions for the file group class.

       &lt;<u>other</u> <u>permissions</u>&gt;
             Permissions for the file other class.

       Each field shall have three character positions:

        1. If <b>'r'</b>, the file is readable; if <b>'-'</b>, the file is not readable.

        2. If <b>'w'</b>, the file is writable; if <b>'-'</b>, the file is not writable.

        3. The first of the following that applies:

           S     If in &lt;<u>owner</u> <u>permissions</u>&gt;, the file is not executable  and  set-user-ID  mode  is  set.  If  in
                 &lt;<u>group</u> <u>permissions</u>&gt;, the file is not executable and set-group-ID mode is set.

           s     If  in  &lt;<u>owner</u> <u>permissions</u>&gt;,  the  file  is  executable  and  set-user-ID  mode  is  set. If in
                 &lt;<u>group</u> <u>permissions</u>&gt;, the file is executable and set-group-ID mode is set.

           T     If in &lt;<u>other</u> <u>permissions</u>&gt; and the file is a directory, search  permission  is  not  granted  to
                 others, and the restricted deletion flag is set.

           t     If  in &lt;<u>other</u> <u>permissions</u>&gt; and the file is a directory, search permission is granted to others,
                 and the restricted deletion flag is set.

           x     The file is executable or the directory is searchable.

           -     None of the attributes of <b>'S'</b>, <b>'s'</b>, <b>'T'</b>, <b>'t'</b>, or <b>'x'</b> applies.

           Implementations may add other characters  to  this  list  for  the  third  character  position.  Such
           additions  shall,  however,  be  written in lowercase if the file is executable or searchable, and in
           uppercase if it is not.

       If any of the <b>-l</b>, <b>-n</b>, <b>-s</b>, <b>-g</b>, or <b>-o</b> options is specified, each list of files within the  directory  shall
       be  preceded  by  a  status  line  indicating  the  number of file system blocks occupied by files in the
       directory in 512-byte units if the <b>-k</b> option is not specified, or 1024-byte units if  the  <b>-k</b>  option  is
       specified, rounded up to the next integral number of units, if necessary. In the POSIX locale, the format
       shall be:

           "total %u\n", &lt;<u>number</u> <u>of</u> <u>units</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>directory</u>&gt;

       If  more  than one directory, or a combination of non-directory files and directories are written, either
       as a result of specifying multiple operands, or the <b>-R</b> option, each list  of  files  within  a  directory
       shall be preceded by:

           "\n%s:\n", &lt;<u>directory</u> <u>name</u>&gt;

       If  this  string  is the first thing to be written, the first &lt;newline&gt; shall not be written. This output
       shall precede the number of units in the directory.

       If the <b>-s</b> option is given, each file shall be written with the number of blocks used by the  file.  Along
       with <b>-C</b>, <b>-1</b>, <b>-m</b>, or <b>-x</b>, the number and a &lt;space&gt; shall precede the filename; with <b>-l</b>, <b>-n</b>, <b>-g</b>, or <b>-o</b>, they
       shall precede each line describing a file.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Many  implementations  use  the &lt;equals-sign&gt; (<b>'='</b>) to denote sockets bound to the file system for the <b>-F</b>
       option. Similarly, many historical implementations use the <b>'s'</b> character to denote sockets as  the  entry
       type characters for the <b>-l</b> option.

       It  is  difficult  for  an  application  to use every part of the file modes field of <u>ls</u> <b>-l</b> in a portable
       manner. Certain file  types  and  executable  bits  are  not  guaranteed  to  be  exactly  as  shown,  as
       implementations  may have extensions. Applications can use this field to pass directly to a user printout
       or prompt, but actions based on its contents should generally be deferred, instead, to the <u>test</u> utility.

       The output of <u>ls</u> (with the <b>-l</b> and related options) contains information that logically could be  used  by
       utilities  such  as  <u>chmod</u>  and  <u>touch</u>  to  restore  files to a known state. However, this information is
       presented in a format that cannot be used directly by those utilities or  be  easily  translated  into  a
       format  that  can  be  used.  A  character  has  been  added to the end of the permissions string so that
       applications at least have an indication that they may be working in  an  area  they  do  not  understand
       instead  of  assuming  that  they  can  translate the permissions string into something that can be used.
       Future versions or related documents may define one or more specific  characters  to  be  used  based  on
       different standard additional or alternative access control mechanisms.

       As  with many of the utilities that deal with filenames, the output of <u>ls</u> for multiple files or in one of
       the long listing formats must be used carefully on systems where filenames  can  contain  embedded  white
       space.  Systems and system administrators should institute policies and user training to limit the use of
       such filenames.

       The number of disk blocks occupied by the file that it reports varies depending on underlying file system
       type, block size units reported, and the method of calculating the number of blocks. On some file  system
       types,  the  number  is  the  actual  number of blocks occupied by the file (counting indirect blocks and
       ignoring holes in the file); on others it is calculated  based  on  the  file  size  (usually  making  an
       allowance for indirect blocks, but ignoring holes).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       An example of a small directory tree being fully listed with <u>ls</u> <b>-laRF</b> <b>a</b> in the POSIX locale:

           total 11
           drwxr-xr-x   3 fox      prog          64 Jul  4 12:07 ./
           drwxrwxrwx   4 fox      prog        3264 Jul  4 12:09 ../
           drwxr-xr-x   2 fox      prog          48 Jul  4 12:07 b/
           -rwxr--r--   1 fox      prog         572 Jul  4 12:07 foo*

           a/b:
           total 4
           drwxr-xr-x   2 fox      prog          48 Jul  4 12:07 ./
           drwxr-xr-x   3 fox      prog          64 Jul  4 12:07 ../
           -rw-r--r--   1 fox      prog         700 Jul  4 12:07 bar

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       Some  historical implementations of the <u>ls</u> utility show all entries in a directory except dot and dot-dot
       when a superuser invokes <u>ls</u> without specifying the <b>-a</b> option. When ``normal''  users  invoke  <u>ls</u>  without
       specifying  <b>-a</b>,  they  should  not  see  information about any files with names beginning with a &lt;period&gt;
       unless they were named as <u>file</u> operands.

       Implementations are expected to traverse arbitrary  depths  when  processing  the  <b>-R</b>  option.  The  only
       limitation  on  depth should be based on running out of physical storage for keeping track of untraversed
       directories.

       The <b>-1</b> (one) option was historically found in BSD and BSD-derived implementations only. It is required in
       this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 so that conforming applications might ensure that output  is  one  entry  per
       line, even if the output is to a terminal.

       The  <b>-S</b> option was added in Issue 7, but had been provided by several implementations for many years. The
       description given in  the  standard  documents  historic  practice,  but  does  not  match  much  of  the
       documentation  that  described its behavior. Historical documentation typically described it as something
       like:

       <b>-S</b>        Sort by size (largest size first) instead of by name. Special character devices  (listed  last)
                 are sorted by name.

       even  though  the  file  type  was  never considered when sorting the output.  Character special files do
       typically sort close to the end of the list because their file size on most implementations is zero.  But
       they  are  sorted  alphabetically with any other files that happen to have the same file size (zero), not
       sorted separately and added to the end.

       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 is frequently silent about what happens when mutually-exclusive  options  are
       specified.  Except  for  <b>-R</b>,  <b>-d</b>, and <b>-f</b>, the <u>ls</u> utility is required to accept multiple options from each
       mutually-exclusive option set without treating them as errors and to use the behavior  specified  by  the
       last  option  given  in  each mutually-exclusive set. Since <u>ls</u> is one of the most aliased commands, it is
       important that the implementation perform intuitively. For example, if the alias were:

           alias ls="ls -C"

       and the user typed <u>ls</u> <b>-1</b> (one), single-text-column output should result, not an error.

       The <b>-g</b>, <b>-l</b> (ell), <b>-n</b>, and <b>-o</b> options are not mutually-exclusive options.  They  all  enable  long  format
       output. They work together to determine whether the file's owner is written (no if <b>-g</b> is present), file's
       group is written (no if <b>-o</b> is present), and if the file's group or owner is written whether it is written
       as the name (default) or a string representation of the UID or GID number (if <b>-n</b> is present). The <b>-C</b>, <b>-m</b>,
       <b>-x</b>,  and <b>-1</b> (one) are mutually-exclusive options and the first three of these disable long format output.
       The <b>-1</b> (one) option does not directly change whether or  not  long  format  output  is  enabled,  but  by
       overriding  <b>-C</b>,  <b>-m</b>,  and  <b>-x</b>, it can re-enable long format output that had been disabled by one of these
       options.

       Earlier versions of this standard did not describe the BSD <b>-A</b> option (like <b>-a</b>, but dot  and  dot-dot  are
       not written out). It has been added due to widespread implementation.

       Implementations  may  make <b>-q</b> the default for terminals to prevent trojan horse attacks on terminals with
       special escape sequences.  This is not required because:

        *  Some control characters may be useful on some terminals; for example, a system might  write  them  as
           <b>"\001"</b> or <b>"^A"</b>.

        *  Special behavior for terminals is not relevant to applications portability.

       An  early  proposal specified that the &lt;<u>optional</u> <u>alternate</u> <u>access</u> <u>method</u> <u>flag</u>&gt; had to be <b>'+'</b> if there was
       an alternate access method used on the file or &lt;space&gt; if there was not. This was changed to  be  &lt;space&gt;
       if there is not and a single printable character if there is. This was done for three reasons:

        1. There are historical implementations using characters other than <b>'+'</b>.

        2. There  are  implementations  that  vary  this  character used in that position to distinguish between
           various alternate access methods in use.

        3. The standard developers did not want to preclude future specifications  that  might  need  a  way  to
           specify more than one alternate access method.

       Nonetheless, implementations providing a single alternate access method are encouraged to use <b>'+'</b>.

       Earlier versions of this standard did not have the <b>-k</b> option, which meant that the <b>-s</b> option could not be
       used  portably  as its block size was implementation-defined, and the units used to specify the number of
       blocks occupied by files in a directory in an <u>ls</u> <b>-l</b> listing were fixed as 512-byte units. The  <b>-k</b>  option
       has  been  added  to  provide  a  way  for the <b>-s</b> option to be used portably, and for consistency it also
       changes the aforementioned units from 512-byte to 1024-byte.

       The &lt;<u>date</u> <u>and</u> <u>time</u>&gt; field in the <b>-l</b> format is specified only for the POSIX locale. As noted,  the  format
       can  be  different  in  other  locales.  No  mechanism  for  defining  this  is present in this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, as the appropriate vehicle is a messaging system; that is, the format should  be  specified
       as a ``message''.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Allowing <b>-f</b> to ignore the <b>-A</b>, <b>-g</b>, <b>-l</b>, <b>-n</b>, <b>-o</b>, and <b>-s</b> options may be removed in a future version.

       A  future version of this standard may require that if the collating sequence for the current locale does
       not have a total ordering of all characters, any filenames or pathnames that collate equally are  further
       compared byte-by-byte using the collating sequence for the POSIX locale.
