</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       find - search for files in a directory hierarchy

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>find</b> [-H] [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [starting-point...] [expression]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual page documents the GNU version of <b>find</b>.  GNU <b>find</b> searches the directory tree rooted at each
       given starting-point by evaluating the given expression from left to right, according  to  the  rules  of
       precedence  (see  section  OPERATORS),  until  the  outcome is known (the left hand side is false for <u>and</u>
       operations, true for <u>or</u>), at which point <b>find</b> moves on to the next file name.  If  no  starting-point  is
       specified, `.' is assumed.

       If  you  are using <b>find</b> in an environment where security is important (for example if you are using it to
       search directories that are writable by other users),  you  should  read  the  `Security  Considerations'
       chapter  of  the  findutils  documentation, which is called <b>Finding</b> <b>Files</b> and comes with findutils.  That
       document also includes a lot more detail and discussion than this manual page, so you may find it a  more
       useful source of information.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>-H</b>,  <b>-L</b>  and  <b>-P</b>  options control the treatment of symbolic links.  Command-line arguments following
       these are taken to be names of files or directories to be examined, up to the first argument that  begins
       with  `-',  or  the  argument  `(' or `!'.  That argument and any following arguments are taken to be the
       expression describing what is to be searched for.  If no paths are given, the current directory is  used.
       If  no expression is given, the expression <b>-print</b> is used (but you should probably consider using <b>-print0</b>
       instead, anyway).

       This manual page talks about `options' within the expression list.  These options control  the  behaviour
       of  <b>find</b>  but are specified immediately after the last path name.  The five `real' options <b>-H</b>, <b>-L</b>, <b>-P</b>, <b>-D</b>
       and <b>-O</b> must appear before the first path name, if at all.  A double dash <b>--</b> could theoretically  be  used
       to signal that any remaining arguments are not options, but this does not really work due to the way <b>find</b>
       determines  the end of the following path arguments: it does that by reading until an expression argument
       comes (which also starts with a `-').  Now, if a path argument would start with a `-',  then  <b>find</b>  would
       treat  it  as  expression argument instead.  Thus, to ensure that all start points are taken as such, and
       especially to prevent that wildcard patterns expanded by the calling shell are not mistakenly treated  as
       expression arguments, it is generally safer to prefix wildcards or dubious path names with either `./' or
       to use absolute path names starting with '/'.  Alternatively, it is generally safe though non-portable to
       use the GNU option <b>-files0-from</b> to pass arbitrary starting points to <b>find</b>.

       -P     Never  follow  symbolic  links.   This  is  the  default  behaviour.  When <b>find</b> examines or prints
              information about files, and the file is a symbolic link, the information used shall be taken from
              the properties of the symbolic link itself.

       -L     Follow symbolic links.  When <b>find</b> examines or prints information about files, the information used
              shall be taken from the properties of the file to which the link points, not from the link  itself
              (unless  it  is  a  broken  symbolic  link or <b>find</b> is unable to examine the file to which the link
              points).  Use of this option implies <b>-noleaf</b>.  If you later use the <b>-P</b> option, <b>-noleaf</b> will  still
              be  in effect.  If <b>-L</b> is in effect and <b>find</b> discovers a symbolic link to a subdirectory during its
              search, the subdirectory pointed to by the symbolic link will be searched.

              When the <b>-L</b> option is in effect, the <b>-type</b> predicate will always match against  the  type  of  the
              file  that  a  symbolic  link  points  to rather than the link itself (unless the symbolic link is
              broken).  Actions that can cause symbolic links to become broken  while  <b>find</b>  is  executing  (for
              example  <b>-delete</b>)  can  give  rise to confusing behaviour.  Using <b>-L</b> causes the <b>-lname</b> and <b>-ilname</b>
              predicates always to return false.

       -H     Do not follow symbolic links, except while processing  the  command  line  arguments.   When  <b>find</b>
              examines  or  prints  information  about  files,  the  information  used  shall  be taken from the
              properties of the symbolic link itself.  The only exception to  this  behaviour  is  when  a  file
              specified  on  the  command  line  is  a  symbolic  link,  and the link can be resolved.  For that
              situation, the information used is taken from whatever the link points to (that is,  the  link  is
              followed).   The information about the link itself is used as a fallback if the file pointed to by
              the symbolic link cannot be examined.  If <b>-H</b> is in effect and one of the paths  specified  on  the
              command  line  is  a symbolic link to a directory, the contents of that directory will be examined
              (though of course <b>-maxdepth</b> <b>0</b> would prevent this).

       If more than one of <b>-H</b>, <b>-L</b> and <b>-P</b> is specified, each overrides the others; the last one appearing on  the
       command  line  takes effect.  Since it is the default, the <b>-P</b> option should be considered to be in effect
       unless either <b>-H</b> or <b>-L</b> is specified.

       GNU <b>find</b> frequently stats files during the processing of the command line itself,  before  any  searching
       has  begun.   These  options  also  affect  how those arguments are processed.  Specifically, there are a
       number of tests that compare  files  listed  on  the  command  line  against  a  file  we  are  currently
       considering.   In  each  case, the file specified on the command line will have been examined and some of
       its properties will have been saved.  If the named file is in fact a symbolic link, and the <b>-P</b> option  is
       in effect (or if neither <b>-H</b> nor <b>-L</b> were specified), the information used for the comparison will be taken
       from  the  properties  of the symbolic link.  Otherwise, it will be taken from the properties of the file
       the link points to.  If <b>find</b> cannot follow the link (for example because it has  insufficient  privileges
       or the link points to a nonexistent file) the properties of the link itself will be used.

       When  the  <b>-H</b>  or  <b>-L</b>  options are in effect, any symbolic links listed as the argument of <b>-newer</b> will be
       dereferenced, and the timestamp will be taken from the file to which the symbolic link points.  The  same
       consideration applies to <b>-newerXY</b>, <b>-anewer</b> and <b>-cnewer</b>.

       The <b>-follow</b> option has a similar effect to <b>-L</b>, though it takes effect at the point where it appears (that
       is, if <b>-L</b> is not used but <b>-follow</b> is, any symbolic links appearing after <b>-follow</b> on the command line will
       be dereferenced, and those before it will not).

       -D debugopts
              Print  diagnostic information; this can be helpful to diagnose problems with why <b>find</b> is not doing
              what you want.  The list of debug options should be comma separated.  Compatibility of  the  debug
              options  is  not  guaranteed  between  releases  of findutils.  For a complete list of valid debug
              options, see the output of <b>find</b> <b>-D</b> <b>help</b>.  Valid debug options include

              exec   Show diagnostic information relating to -exec, -execdir, -ok and -okdir

              opt    Prints diagnostic information relating to the optimisation of the expression tree; see  the
                     -O option.

              rates  Prints a summary indicating how often each predicate succeeded or failed.

              search Navigate the directory tree verbosely.

              stat   Print  messages  as  files  are  examined  with  the <b>stat</b> and <b>lstat</b> system calls.  The <b>find</b>
                     program tries to minimise such calls.

              tree   Show the expression tree in its original and optimized form.

              all    Enable all of the other debug options (but <b>help</b>).

              help   Explain the debugging options.

       -Olevel
              Enables query optimisation.   The  <b>find</b>  program  reorders  tests  to  speed  up  execution  while
              preserving the overall effect; that is, predicates with side effects are not reordered relative to
              each other.  The optimisations performed at each optimisation level are as follows.

              0      Equivalent to optimisation level 1.

              1      This  is  the  default  optimisation  level  and  corresponds to the traditional behaviour.
                     Expressions are reordered so that tests based only on the names of files (for example <b>-name</b>
                     and <b>-regex</b>) are performed first.

              2      Any <b>-type</b> or <b>-xtype</b> tests are performed after any tests based only on the names  of  files,
                     but  before  any tests that require information from the inode.  On many modern versions of
                     Unix, file types are returned by <b>readdir()</b> and so these predicates are faster  to  evaluate
                     than  predicates  which  need to stat the file first.  If you use the <b>-fstype</b> <u>FOO</u> predicate
                     and specify a filesystem type <u>FOO</u> which is not known (that is, present in  `<a href="file:/etc/mtab">/etc/mtab</a>')  at
                     the time <b>find</b> starts, that predicate is equivalent to <b>-false</b>.

              3      At  this  optimisation level, the full cost-based query optimizer is enabled.  The order of
                     tests is modified so that cheap (i.e. fast) tests are performed first  and  more  expensive
                     ones  are  performed  later, if necessary.  Within each cost band, predicates are evaluated
                     earlier or later according to  whether  they  are  likely  to  succeed  or  not.   For  <b>-o</b>,
                     predicates  which are likely to succeed are evaluated earlier, and for <b>-a</b>, predicates which
                     are likely to fail are evaluated earlier.

              The cost-based optimizer has a fixed idea of how likely any given test is  to  succeed.   In  some
              cases  the  probability  takes account of the specific nature of the test (for example, <b>-type</b> <b>f</b> is
              assumed to be more likely to succeed than <b>-type</b> <b>c</b>).  The cost-based optimizer is  currently  being
              evaluated.   If  it  does  not actually improve the performance of <b>find</b>, it will be removed again.
              Conversely, optimisations that prove to be reliable, robust and effective may be enabled at  lower
              optimisation  levels  over  time.  However, the default behaviour (i.e. optimisation level 1) will
              not be changed in the 4.3.x release series.  The findutils test suite runs all the tests  on  <b>find</b>
              at each optimisation level and ensures that the result is the same.

              The  re-ordering  of  operations  performed by the cost-based optimizer can result in user-visible
              behaviour change.  For example, the <b>-readable</b> and <b>-empty</b> predicates are sensitive to  re-ordering.
              If  they  are  run  in  the order <b>-empty</b> <b>-readable</b>, an error message will be issued for unreadable
              directories.  If they are run in the order <b>-readable</b> <b>-empty</b> no error message will be issued.  This
              is the reason why such operation re-ordering is not performed at the default optimisation level.

</pre><h4><b>EXPRESSION</b></h4><pre>
       The  part  of  the  command  line after the list of starting points is the <u>expression</u>.  This is a kind of
       query specification describing how we match files and what we do with the files that  were  matched.   An
       expression is composed of a sequence of things:

       Tests  Tests  return  a  true  or  false  value,  usually  on the basis of some property of a file we are
              considering.  The <b>-empty</b> test for example is true only when the current file is empty.

       Actions
              Actions have side effects (such as printing something on the standard output)  and  return  either
              true or false, usually based on whether or not they are successful.  The <b>-print</b> action for example
              prints the name of the current file on the standard output.

       Global options
              Global  options  affect  the  operation  of tests and actions specified on any part of the command
              line.  Global options always return true.  The <b>-depth</b> option for example makes <b>find</b>  traverse  the
              file system in a depth-first order.

       Positional options
              Positional  options  affect  only  tests  or actions which follow them.  Positional options always
              return true.  The <b>-regextype</b> option for example is positional, specifying the  regular  expression
              dialect for regular expressions occurring later on the command line.

       Operators
              Operators  join  together  the  other  items  within  the expression.  They include for example <b>-o</b>
              (meaning logical OR) and <b>-a</b> (meaning logical AND).  Where an operator is missing, <b>-a</b> is assumed.

       The <b>-print</b> action is performed on all files for which the whole expression is true, unless it contains an
       action other than <b>-prune</b> or <b>-quit</b>.   Actions  which  inhibit  the  default  <b>-print</b>  are  <b>-delete</b>,  <b>-exec</b>,
       <b>-execdir</b>, <b>-ok</b>, <b>-okdir</b>, <b>-fls</b>, <b>-fprint</b>, <b>-fprintf</b>, <b>-ls</b>, <b>-print</b> and <b>-printf</b>.

       The <b>-delete</b> action also acts like an option (since it implies <b>-depth</b>).

   <b>POSITIONAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       Positional options always return true.  They affect only tests occurring later on the command line.

       -daystart
              Measure  times  (for  <b>-amin</b>, <b>-atime</b>, <b>-cmin</b>, <b>-ctime</b>, <b>-mmin</b>, and <b>-mtime</b>) from the beginning of today
              rather than from 24 hours ago.  This option only affects tests which appear later on  the  command
              line.

       -follow
              Deprecated; use the <b>-L</b> option instead.  Dereference symbolic links.  Implies <b>-noleaf</b>.  The <b>-follow</b>
              option  affects  only  those tests which appear after it on the command line.  Unless the <b>-H</b> or <b>-L</b>
              option has been specified, the position of the <b>-follow</b> option changes the behaviour of the  <b>-newer</b>
              predicate;  any  files  listed as the argument of <b>-newer</b> will be dereferenced if they are symbolic
              links.  The same consideration applies to <b>-newerXY</b>, <b>-anewer</b> and  <b>-cnewer</b>.   Similarly,  the  <b>-type</b>
              predicate  will  always  match  against the type of the file that a symbolic link points to rather
              than the link itself.  Using <b>-follow</b> causes the <b>-lname</b> <b>and</b> <b>-ilname</b>  predicates  always  to  return
              false.

       -regextype <u>type</u>
              Changes  the regular expression syntax understood by <b>-regex</b> and <b>-iregex</b> tests which occur later on
              the command line.  To see which regular expression types  are  known,  use  <b>-regextype</b> <b>help</b>.   The
              Texinfo  documentation  (see <b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b>) explains the meaning of and differences between the various
              types of regular expression.  If you do not use this  option,  find  behaves  as  if  the  regular
              expression type <b>emacs</b> had been specified.

       -warn, -nowarn
              Turn  warning messages on or off.  These warnings apply only to the command line usage, not to any
              conditions that <b>find</b>  might  encounter  when  it  searches  directories.   The  default  behaviour
              corresponds  to  <b>-warn</b> if standard input is a tty, and to <b>-nowarn</b> otherwise.  If a warning message
              relating to command-line usage is produced, the exit status of  <b>find</b>  is  not  affected.   If  the
              <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b> environment variable is set, and <b>-warn</b> is also used, it is not specified which, if
              any, warnings will be active.

   <b>GLOBAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       Global  options always return true.  Global options take effect even for tests which occur earlier on the
       command line.  To prevent confusion, global options should be specified on  the  command-line  after  the
       list  of  start points, just before the first test, positional option or action.  If you specify a global
       option in some other place, <b>find</b> will issue a warning message explaining that this can be confusing.

       The global options occur after the list of start points, and so are not the same kind of  option  as  <b>-L</b>,
       for example.

       -d     A synonym for -depth, for compatibility with FreeBSD, NetBSD, MacOS X and OpenBSD.

       -depth Process  each  directory's  contents before the directory itself.  The -delete action also implies
              <b>-depth</b>.

       -files0-from <u>file</u>
              Read the starting points from <u>file</u> instead of getting them on the command line.   In  contrast  to
              the  known  limitations  of  passing starting points via arguments on the command line, namely the
              limitation of the amount of file names, and the inherent ambiguity of  file  names  clashing  with
              option  names,  using  this option allows to safely pass an arbitrary number of starting points to
              <b>find</b>.

              Using this option and passing starting points on the command line is mutually  exclusive,  and  is
              therefore not allowed at the same time.

              The  <u>file</u>  argument  is mandatory.  One can use <b>-files0-from</b> <b>-</b> to read the list of starting points
              from the <u>standard</u> <u>input</u> stream, and e.g. from a pipe.  In this case, the actions  <b>-ok</b>  and  <b>-okdir</b>
              are  not allowed, because they would obviously interfere with reading from <u>standard</u> <u>input</u> in order
              to get a user confirmation.

              The starting points in <u>file</u> have to be separated by ASCII NUL  characters.   Two  consecutive  NUL
              characters, i.e., a starting point with a Zero-length file name is not allowed and will lead to an
              error diagnostic followed by a non-Zero exit code later.

              In  the  case the given <u>file</u> is empty, <b>find</b> does not process any starting point and therefore will
              exit immediately after parsing the program arguments.  This  is  unlike  the  standard  invocation
              where <b>find</b> assumes the current directory as starting point if no path argument is passed.

              The  processing  of  the  starting  points  is  otherwise  as  usual, e.g.  <b>find</b> will recurse into
              subdirectories unless  otherwise  prevented.   To  process  only  the  starting  points,  one  can
              additionally pass <b>-maxdepth</b> <b>0</b>.

              Further  notes: if a file is listed more than once in the input file, it is unspecified whether it
              is visited more than once.  If the <u>file</u> is mutated during the operation of  <b>find</b>,  the  result  is
              unspecified  as well.  Finally, the seek position within the named <u>file</u> at the time <b>find</b> exits, be
              it with <b>-quit</b> or in any other way, is also unspecified.  By "unspecified" here is  meant  that  it
              may  or  may  not work or do any specific thing, and that the behavior may change from platform to
              platform, or from <b>findutils</b> release to release.

       -help, --help
              Print a summary of the command-line usage of <b>find</b> and exit.

       -ignore_readdir_race
              Normally, <b>find</b> will emit an error message when it fails to stat a file.  If you give  this  option
              and  a file is deleted between the time <b>find</b> reads the name of the file from the directory and the
              time it tries to stat the file, no error message will be issued.  This also applies  to  files  or
              directories  whose  names are given on the command line.  This option takes effect at the time the
              command line is read, which means that you cannot search one part  of  the  filesystem  with  this
              option  on and part of it with this option off (if you need to do that, you will need to issue two
              <b>find</b> commands instead, one with the option and one without it).

              Furthermore, <b>find</b> with the <b>-ignore_readdir_race</b> option will ignore errors of the <b>-delete</b> action in
              the case the file has disappeared since the parent directory was read: it will not output an error
              diagnostic, and the return code of the <b>-delete</b> action will be true.

       -maxdepth <u>levels</u>
              Descend at most <u>levels</u> (a non-negative integer) levels of directories below  the  starting-points.
              Using <b>-maxdepth</b> <b>0</b> means only apply the tests and actions to the starting-points themselves.

       -mindepth <u>levels</u>
              Do  not  apply  any  tests  or actions at levels less than <u>levels</u> (a non-negative integer).  Using
              <b>-mindepth</b> <b>1</b> means process all files except the starting-points.

       -mount Don't descend directories on other filesystems.  An alternate name for  <b>-xdev</b>,  for  compatibility
              with some other versions of <b>find</b>.

       -noignore_readdir_race
              Turns off the effect of <b>-ignore_readdir_race</b>.

       -noleaf
              Do  not  optimize by assuming that directories contain 2 fewer subdirectories than their hard link
              count.  This option is needed when searching filesystems that do not follow  the  Unix  directory-
              link  convention, such as CD-ROM or MS-DOS filesystems or AFS volume mount points.  Each directory
              on a normal Unix filesystem has at least 2 hard links: its name and its `.' entry.   Additionally,
              its  subdirectories  (if  any)  each  have  a  `..'  entry linked to that directory.  When <b>find</b> is
              examining a directory, after it has statted 2  fewer  subdirectories  than  the  directory's  link
              count, it knows that the rest of the entries in the directory are non-directories (`leaf' files in
              the directory tree).  If only the files' names need to be examined, there is no need to stat them;
              this gives a significant increase in search speed.

       -version, --version
              Print the <b>find</b> version number and exit.

       -xdev  Don't descend directories on other filesystems.

   <b>TESTS</b>
       Some  tests,  for  example  <b>-newerXY</b>  and  <b>-samefile</b>,  allow  comparison between the file currently being
       examined and some reference file specified  on  the  command  line.   When  these  tests  are  used,  the
       interpretation of the reference file is determined by the options <b>-H</b>, <b>-L</b> and <b>-P</b> and any previous <b>-follow</b>,
       but  the  reference file is only examined once, at the time the command line is parsed.  If the reference
       file cannot be examined (for example, the <b><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></b>(2) system call fails for it), an error message is  issued,
       and <b>find</b> exits with a nonzero status.

       A  numeric argument <u>n</u> can be specified to tests (like <b>-amin</b>, <b>-mtime</b>, <b>-gid</b>, <b>-inum</b>, <b>-links</b>, <b>-size</b>, <b>-uid</b> and
       <b>-used</b>) as

       <u>+n</u>     for greater than <u>n</u>,

       <u>-n</u>     for less than <u>n</u>,

       <u>n</u>      for exactly <u>n</u>.

       Supported tests:

       -amin <u>n</u>
              File was last accessed less than, more than or exactly <u>n</u> minutes ago.

       -anewer <u>reference</u>
              Time of the last access of the current file is more recent than that of the last data modification
              of the <u>reference</u> file.  If <u>reference</u> is a symbolic link and the <b>-H</b> option or the <b>-L</b> option  is  in
              effect, then the time of the last data modification of the file it points to is always used.

       -atime <u>n</u>
              File  was last accessed less than, more than or exactly <u>n</u>*24 hours ago.  When <b>find</b> figures out how
              many 24-hour periods ago the file was last accessed, any fractional part is ignored, so  to  match
              <b>-atime</b> <b>+1</b>, a file has to have been accessed at least <u>two</u> days ago.

       -cmin <u>n</u>
              File's status was last changed less than, more than or exactly <u>n</u> minutes ago.

       -cnewer <u>reference</u>
              Time  of  the  last  status  change  of the current file is more recent than that of the last data
              modification of the <u>reference</u> file.  If <u>reference</u> is a symbolic link and the <b>-H</b> option or  the  <b>-L</b>
              option  is  in  effect,  then  the  time of the last data modification of the file it points to is
              always used.

       -ctime <u>n</u>
              File's status was last changed less than, more than or exactly <u>n</u>*24 hours ago.  See  the  comments
              for <b>-atime</b> to understand how rounding affects the interpretation of file status change times.

       -empty File is empty and is either a regular file or a directory.

       -executable
              Matches files which are executable and directories which are searchable (in a file name resolution
              sense)  by  the  current user.  This takes into account access control lists and other permissions
              artefacts which the <b>-perm</b> test ignores.  This test makes use of the <b><a href="../man2/access.2.html">access</a></b>(2) system call, and  so
              can  be  fooled  by  NFS  servers  which  do  UID  mapping (or root-squashing), since many systems
              implement <b><a href="../man2/access.2.html">access</a></b>(2) in the client's kernel and so cannot make use of the UID  mapping  information
              held  on  the server.  Because this test is based only on the result of the <b><a href="../man2/access.2.html">access</a></b>(2) system call,
              there is no guarantee that a file for which this test succeeds can actually be executed.

       -false Always false.

       -fstype <u>type</u>
              File is on a filesystem of type <u>type</u>.  The valid filesystem types vary among different versions of
              Unix; an incomplete list of filesystem types that are accepted on some version of Unix or  another
              is:  ufs,  4.2,  4.3, nfs, tmp, mfs, S51K, S52K.  You can use <b>-printf</b> with the %F directive to see
              the types of your filesystems.

       -gid <u>n</u> File's numeric group ID is less than, more than or exactly <u>n</u>.

       -group <u>gname</u>
              File belongs to group <u>gname</u> (numeric group ID allowed).

       -ilname <u>pattern</u>
              Like <b>-lname</b>, but the match is case insensitive.  If the <b>-L</b> option or  the  <b>-follow</b>  option  is  in
              effect, this test returns false unless the symbolic link is broken.

       -iname <u>pattern</u>
              Like  <b>-name</b>,  but  the match is case insensitive.  For example, the patterns `fo*' and `F??' match
              the file names `Foo', `FOO', `foo', `fOo', etc.  The pattern `*foo*` will also match a file called
              '.foobar'.

       -inum <u>n</u>
              File has inode number smaller than, greater than or exactly <u>n</u>.  It is normally easier to  use  the
              <b>-samefile</b> test instead.

       -ipath <u>pattern</u>
              Like <b>-path</b>.  but the match is case insensitive.

       -iregex <u>pattern</u>
              Like <b>-regex</b>, but the match is case insensitive.

       -iwholename <u>pattern</u>
              See -ipath.  This alternative is less portable than <b>-ipath</b>.

       -links <u>n</u>
              File has less than, more than or exactly <u>n</u> hard links.

       -lname <u>pattern</u>
              File  is  a  symbolic  link whose contents match shell pattern <u>pattern</u>.  The metacharacters do not
              treat `/' or `.' specially.  If the <b>-L</b> option or the  <b>-follow</b>  option  is  in  effect,  this  test
              returns false unless the symbolic link is broken.

       -mmin <u>n</u>
              File's data was last modified less than, more than or exactly <u>n</u> minutes ago.

       -mtime <u>n</u>
              File's  data  was  last modified less than, more than or exactly <u>n</u>*24 hours ago.  See the comments
              for <b>-atime</b> to understand how rounding affects the interpretation of file modification times.

       -name <u>pattern</u>
              Base of file name (the path with the leading directories removed) matches shell  pattern  <u>pattern</u>.
              Because  the  leading  directories of the file names are removed, the <u>pattern</u> should not include a
              slash, because `-name a/b' will never match anything (and you probably want to use <b>-path</b> instead).
              An exception to this is when using only a slash as <u>pattern</u> (`-name /'), because that  is  a  valid
              string  for  matching  the root directory "/" (because the base name of "/" is "/").  A warning is
              issued if you try to pass a pattern containing a - but not  consisting  solely  of  one  -  slash,
              unless the environment variable <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b> is set or the option <b>-nowarn</b> is used.

              To  ignore  a  directory and the files under it, use <b>-prune</b> rather than checking every file in the
              tree; see an example in the description of that  action.   Braces  are  not  recognised  as  being
              special,  despite  the fact that some shells including Bash imbue braces with a special meaning in
              shell patterns.  The filename matching is  performed  with  the  use  of  the  <b><a href="../man3/fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch</a></b>(3)  library
              function.   Don't forget to enclose the pattern in quotes in order to protect it from expansion by
              the shell.

       -newer <u>reference</u>
              Time of the last data modification of the current file is more recent than that of the  last  data
              modification  of  the <u>reference</u> file.  If <u>reference</u> is a symbolic link and the <b>-H</b> option or the <b>-L</b>
              option is in effect, then the time of the last data modification of  the  file  it  points  to  is
              always used.

       -newerXY <u>reference</u>
              Succeeds  if  timestamp  <u>X</u>  of  the  file  being  considered is newer than timestamp <u>Y</u> of the file
              <u>reference</u>.  The letters <u>X</u> and <u>Y</u> can be any of the following letters:

              a   The access time of the file <u>reference</u>
              B   The birth time of the file <u>reference</u>
              c   The inode status change time of <u>reference</u>
              m   The modification time of the file <u>reference</u>
              t   <u>reference</u> is interpreted directly as a time

              Some combinations are invalid; for example, it is invalid for <u>X</u> to be <u>t</u>.   Some  combinations  are
              not  implemented  on all systems; for example <u>B</u> is not supported on all systems.  If an invalid or
              unsupported combination of <u>XY</u> is specified,  a  fatal  error  results.   Time  specifications  are
              interpreted as for the argument to the <b>-d</b> option of GNU <b>date</b>.  If you try to use the birth time of
              a  reference file, and the birth time cannot be determined, a fatal error message results.  If you
              specify a test which refers to the birth time of files being examined, this test will fail for any
              files where the birth time is unknown.

       -nogroup
              No group corresponds to file's numeric group ID.

       -nouser
              No user corresponds to file's numeric user ID.

       -path <u>pattern</u>
              File name matches shell pattern <u>pattern</u>.  The metacharacters do not treat `/'  or  `.'  specially;
              so, for example,
                  find . -path "./sr*sc"
              will  print  an  entry  for  a  directory  called  <u>./src/misc</u>  (if one exists).  To ignore a whole
              directory tree, use <b>-prune</b> rather than checking every file in the tree.   Note  that  the  pattern
              match  test  applies  to  the  whole file name, starting from one of the start points named on the
              command line.  It would only make sense to use an absolute path name here if  the  relevant  start
              point is also an absolute path.  This means that this command will never match anything:
                  find bar -path /foo/bar/myfile -print
              Find  compares  the <b>-path</b> argument with the concatenation of a directory name and the base name of
              the file it's examining.  Since the concatenation will never end with  a  slash,  <b>-path</b>  arguments
              ending in a slash will match nothing (except perhaps a start point specified on the command line).
              The predicate <b>-path</b> is also supported by HP-UX <b>find</b> and is part of the POSIX 2008 standard.

       -perm <u>mode</u>
              File's permission bits are exactly <u>mode</u> (octal or symbolic).  Since an exact match is required, if
              you  want  to  use  this  form  for  symbolic modes, you may have to specify a rather complex mode
              string.  For example `-perm g=w' will only match files which have mode 0020  (that  is,  ones  for
              which group write permission is the only permission set).  It is more likely that you will want to
              use  the  `/'  or  `-'  forms,  for  example `-perm -g=w', which matches any file with group write
              permission.  See the <b>EXAMPLES</b> section for some illustrative examples.

       -perm -<u>mode</u>
              All of the permission bits <u>mode</u> are set for the file.  Symbolic modes are accepted in  this  form,
              and this is usually the way in which you would want to use them.  You must specify `u', `g' or `o'
              if you use a symbolic mode.  See the <b>EXAMPLES</b> section for some illustrative examples.

       -perm /<u>mode</u>
              Any  of  the permission bits <u>mode</u> are set for the file.  Symbolic modes are accepted in this form.
              You must specify `u', `g' or `o' if you use a symbolic mode.  See the <b>EXAMPLES</b>  section  for  some
              illustrative  examples.   If  no  permission bits in <u>mode</u> are set, this test matches any file (the
              idea here is to be consistent with the behaviour of <b>-perm</b> <b>-000</b>).

       -perm +<u>mode</u>
              This is no longer supported (and has been deprecated since 2005).  Use <b>-perm</b> <b>/</b><u>mode</u> instead.

       -readable
              Matches files which are readable by the current user.  This  takes  into  account  access  control
              lists  and  other  permissions artefacts which the <b>-perm</b> test ignores.  This test makes use of the
              <b><a href="../man2/access.2.html">access</a></b>(2) system call, and so can be fooled  by  NFS  servers  which  do  UID  mapping  (or  root-
              squashing),  since  many systems implement <b><a href="../man2/access.2.html">access</a></b>(2) in the client's kernel and so cannot make use
              of the UID mapping information held on the server.

       -regex <u>pattern</u>
              File name matches regular expression <u>pattern</u>.  This is a match on the whole path,  not  a  search.
              For  example,  to  match  a  file  named  <u>./fubar3,</u> you can use the regular expression `.*bar.' or
              `.*b.*3', but not `f.*r3'.  The regular expressions  understood  by  <b>find</b>  are  by  default  Emacs
              Regular Expressions, but this can be changed with the <b>-regextype</b> option.

       -samefile <u>name</u>
              File refers to the same inode as <u>name</u>.  When <b>-L</b> is in effect, this can include symbolic links.

       -size <u>n</u>[cwbkMG]
              File  uses  less than, more than or exactly <u>n</u> units of space, rounding up.  The following suffixes
              can be used:

              `b'    for 512-byte blocks (this is the default if no suffix is used)

              `c'    for bytes

              `w'    for two-byte words

              `k'    for kibibytes (KiB, units of 1024 bytes)

              `M'    for mebibytes (MiB, units of 1024 * 1024 = 1048576 bytes)

              `G'    for gibibytes (GiB, units of 1024 * 1024 * 1024 = 1073741824 bytes)

              The size is simply the st_size member of the struct stat populated by the lstat (or  stat)  system
              call,  rounded  up  as  shown  above.  In other words, it's consistent with the result you get for
              <b>ls</b> <b>-l</b>.  Bear in mind that the `%k' and `%b' format  specifiers  of  <b>-printf</b>  handle  sparse  files
              differently.   The  `b' suffix always denotes 512-byte blocks and never 1024-byte blocks, which is
              different to the behaviour of <b>-ls</b>.

              The + and - prefixes signify greater than and less than, as usual; i.e., an exact size of <u>n</u>  units
              does  not  match.  Bear in mind that the size is rounded up to the next unit.  Therefore <b>-size</b> <b>-1M</b>
              is not equivalent to <b>-size</b> <b>-1048576c</b>.  The former only matches empty  files,  the  latter  matches
              files from 0 to 1,048,575 bytes.

       -true  Always true.

       -type <u>c</u>
              File is of type <u>c</u>:

              b      block (buffered) special

              c      character (unbuffered) special

              d      directory

              p      named pipe (FIFO)

              f      regular file

              l      symbolic  link;  this  is  never  true if the <b>-L</b> option or the <b>-follow</b> option is in effect,
                     unless the symbolic link is broken.  If you want to search for symbolic links when <b>-L</b> is in
                     effect, use <b>-xtype</b>.

              s      socket

              D      door (Solaris)

              To search for more than one type at once, you  can  supply  the  combined  list  of  type  letters
              separated by a comma `,' (GNU extension).

       -uid <u>n</u> File's numeric user ID is less than, more than or exactly <u>n</u>.

       -used <u>n</u>
              File was last accessed less than, more than or exactly <u>n</u> days after its status was last changed.

       -user <u>uname</u>
              File is owned by user <u>uname</u> (numeric user ID allowed).

       -wholename <u>pattern</u>
              See -path.  This alternative is less portable than <b>-path</b>.

       -writable
              Matches  files  which  are  writable  by the current user.  This takes into account access control
              lists and other permissions artefacts which the <b>-perm</b> test ignores.  This test makes  use  of  the
              <b><a href="../man2/access.2.html">access</a></b>(2)  system  call,  and  so  can  be  fooled  by  NFS servers which do UID mapping (or root-
              squashing), since many systems implement <b><a href="../man2/access.2.html">access</a></b>(2) in the client's kernel and so cannot  make  use
              of the UID mapping information held on the server.

       -xtype <u>c</u>
              The  same as <b>-type</b> unless the file is a symbolic link.  For symbolic links: if the <b>-H</b> or <b>-P</b> option
              was specified, true if the file is a link to a file of type <u>c</u>; if the <b>-L</b> option  has  been  given,
              true  if  <u>c</u>  is  `l'.  In other words, for symbolic links, <b>-xtype</b> checks the type of the file that
              <b>-type</b> does not check.  If a symbolic link is broken (because the thing it points to does not exist
              or the link points to itself) then <b>-xtype</b> will behave the same as <b>-type</b>.

       -context <u>pattern</u>
              (SELinux only) Security context of the file matches glob <u>pattern</u>.

   <b>ACTIONS</b>
       -delete
              Delete files or directories; true if removal succeeded.  If the removal failed, an  error  message
              is issued and <b>find</b>'s exit status will be nonzero (when it eventually exits).

              <b>Warning</b>:  Don't  forget  that <b>find</b> evaluates the command line as an expression, so putting <b>-delete</b>
              first will make <b>find</b> try to delete everything below the starting points you specified.

              The use of the <b>-delete</b> action on the command line automatically turns on the <b>-depth</b> option.  As in
              turn <b>-depth</b> makes <b>-prune</b> ineffective, the <b>-delete</b> action cannot usefully be combined with <b>-prune</b>.

              Often, the user might want to test a <b>find</b> command line with <b>-print</b> prior to adding <b>-delete</b> for the
              actual removal run.  To avoid surprising results, it is usually best to  remember  to  use  <b>-depth</b>
              explicitly during those earlier test runs.

              The <b>-delete</b> action will fail to remove a directory unless it is empty.

              Together  with  the  <b>-ignore_readdir_race</b> option, <b>find</b> will ignore errors of the <b>-delete</b> action in
              the case the file has disappeared since the parent directory was read: it will not output an error
              diagnostic, not change the exit code to nonzero, and the return code of the <b>-delete</b> action will be
              true.

       -exec <u>command</u> ;
              Execute <u>command</u>; true if 0 status is returned.  All following arguments to <b>find</b> are  taken  to  be
              arguments  to  the command until an argument consisting of `;' is encountered.  The string `{}' is
              replaced by the current file name being processed everywhere it occurs in  the  arguments  to  the
              command,  not  just  in  arguments  where it is alone, as in some versions of <b>find</b>.  Both of these
              constructions might need to be escaped (with a `\') or quoted to protect them  from  expansion  by
              the  shell.   See the <b>EXAMPLES</b> section for examples of the use of the <b>-exec</b> option.  The specified
              command is run once for each matched file.  The command is executed  in  the  starting  directory.
              There  are  unavoidable  security problems surrounding use of the <b>-exec</b> action; you should use the
              <b>-execdir</b> option instead.

       -exec <u>command</u> {} +
              This variant of the <b>-exec</b> action runs the specified command on the selected files, but the command
              line is built by appending each selected file name at the end; the total number of invocations  of
              the command will be much less than the number of matched files.  The command line is built in much
              the same way that <b>xargs</b> builds its command lines.  Only one instance of `{}' is allowed within the
              command, and it must appear at the end, immediately before the `+'; it needs to be escaped (with a
              `\')  or  quoted  to  protect it from interpretation by the shell.  The command is executed in the
              starting directory.  If any invocation with the `+' form returns a non-zero value as exit  status,
              then  <b>find</b>  returns a non-zero exit status.  If <b>find</b> encounters an error, this can sometimes cause
              an immediate exit, so some pending commands may not be run at  all.   For  this  reason  <b>-exec</b> <u>my-</u>
              <u>command</u> <b>...</b> <b>{}</b> <b>+</b> <b>-quit</b>  may  not  result  in <u>my-command</u> actually being run.  This variant of <b>-exec</b>
              always returns true.

       -execdir <u>command</u> ;

       -execdir <u>command</u> {} +
              Like <b>-exec</b>, but the specified command is run from the subdirectory containing  the  matched  file,
              which  is  not  normally the directory in which you started <b>find</b>.  As with -exec, the {} should be
              quoted if find is being invoked from a shell.   This  a  much  more  secure  method  for  invoking
              commands,  as  it  avoids race conditions during resolution of the paths to the matched files.  As
              with the <b>-exec</b> action, the `+' form of <b>-execdir</b> will build a command line to process more than one
              matched file, but any given invocation of <u>command</u> will only list files  that  exist  in  the  same
              subdirectory.   If  you  use this option, you must ensure that your <b>PATH</b> environment variable does
              not reference `.';  otherwise,  an  attacker  can  run  any  commands  they  like  by  leaving  an
              appropriately-named  file  in  a  directory  in  which you will run <b>-execdir</b>.  The same applies to
              having entries in <b>PATH</b> which are empty  or  which  are  not  absolute  directory  names.   If  any
              invocation with the `+' form returns a non-zero value as exit status, then <b>find</b> returns a non-zero
              exit  status.   If  <b>find</b>  encounters an error, this can sometimes cause an immediate exit, so some
              pending commands may not be run at all.  The result of the action depends on whether the <b>+</b> or  the
              <b>;</b>  variant  is  being used; <b>-execdir</b> <u>command</u> <b>{}</b> <b>+</b> always returns true, while <b>-execdir</b> <u>command</u> <b>{}</b> <b>;</b>
              returns true only if <u>command</u> returns 0.

       -fls <u>file</u>
              True; like <b>-ls</b> but write to <u>file</u> like <b>-fprint</b>.  The output file is always  created,  even  if  the
              predicate  is  never matched.  See the <b>UNUSUAL</b> <b>FILENAMES</b> section for information about how unusual
              characters in filenames are handled.

       -fprint <u>file</u>
              True; print the full file name into file <u>file</u>.  If <u>file</u> does not exist when <b>find</b>  is  run,  it  is
              created;  if  it  does  exist,  it  is  truncated.  The file names <u>/dev/stdout</u> and <u>/dev/stderr</u> are
              handled specially; they refer to the standard output and standard error output, respectively.  The
              output file is always created, even if the predicate is never matched.  See the <b>UNUSUAL</b>  <b>FILENAMES</b>
              section for information about how unusual characters in filenames are handled.

       -fprint0 <u>file</u>
              True; like <b>-print0</b> but write to <u>file</u> like <b>-fprint</b>.  The output file is always created, even if the
              predicate  is  never matched.  See the <b>UNUSUAL</b> <b>FILENAMES</b> section for information about how unusual
              characters in filenames are handled.

       -fprintf <u>file</u> <u>format</u>
              True; like <b>-printf</b> but write to <u>file</u> like <b>-fprint</b>.  The output file is always created, even if the
              predicate is never matched.  See the <b>UNUSUAL</b> <b>FILENAMES</b> section for information about  how  unusual
              characters in filenames are handled.

       -ls    True;  list  current  file  in  <b>ls</b>  <b>-dils</b> format on standard output.  The block counts are of 1 KB
              blocks, unless the environment variable <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b> is set, in which case 512-byte blocks  are
              used.  See the <b>UNUSUAL</b> <b>FILENAMES</b> section for information about how unusual characters in filenames
              are handled.

       -ok <u>command</u> ;
              Like  <b>-exec</b>  but  ask the user first.  If the user agrees, run the command.  Otherwise just return
              false.  If the command is run, its standard input is redirected from <u>/dev/null</u>.  This  action  may
              not be specified together with the <b>-files0-from</b> option.

              The  response to the prompt is matched against a pair of regular expressions to determine if it is
              an affirmative or negative response.  This regular expression is obtained from the system  if  the
              <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b>  environment  variable  is set, or otherwise from <b>find</b>'s message translations.  If
              the system has no suitable definition, <b>find</b>'s own definition will be used.  In  either  case,  the
              interpretation  of  the  regular  expression  itself will be affected by the environment variables
              <b>LC_CTYPE</b> (character classes) and <b>LC_COLLATE</b> (character ranges and equivalence classes).

       -okdir <u>command</u> ;
              Like <b>-execdir</b> but ask the user first in the same way as for <b>-ok</b>.  If the user does not agree, just
              return false.  If the command is run, its standard  input  is  redirected  from  <u>/dev/null</u>.   This
              action may not be specified together with the <b>-files0-from</b> option.

       -print True;  print  the full file name on the standard output, followed by a newline.  If you are piping
              the output of <b>find</b> into another program and there is the faintest possibility that the files which
              you are searching for might contain a newline,  then  you  should  seriously  consider  using  the
              <b>-print0</b>  option  instead  of  <b>-print</b>.  See the <b>UNUSUAL</b> <b>FILENAMES</b> section for information about how
              unusual characters in filenames are handled.

       -print0
              True; print the full file name on the standard output, followed by a null  character  (instead  of
              the  newline  character  that <b>-print</b> uses).  This allows file names that contain newlines or other
              types of white space to be correctly interpreted by programs that process the <b>find</b>  output.   This
              option corresponds to the <b>-0</b> option of <b>xargs</b>.

       -printf <u>format</u>
              True;  print  <u>format</u>  on  the standard output, interpreting `\' escapes and `%' directives.  Field
              widths and precisions can be specified as with the <b><a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a></b>(3) C function.  Please note that many of
              the fields are printed as %s rather than %d, and this may mean that flags don't work as you  might
              expect.   This  also  means  that  the  `-'  flag does work (it forces fields to be left-aligned).
              Unlike <b>-print</b>, <b>-printf</b> does not add a  newline  at  the  end  of  the  string.   The  escapes  and
              directives are:

              \a     Alarm bell.

              \b     Backspace.

              \c     Stop printing from this format immediately and flush the output.

              \f     Form feed.

              \n     Newline.

              \r     Carriage return.

              \t     Horizontal tab.

              \v     Vertical tab.

              \0     ASCII NUL.

              \\     A literal backslash (`\').

              \NNN   The character whose ASCII code is NNN (octal).

              A  `\' character followed by any other character is treated as an ordinary character, so they both
              are printed.

              %%     A literal percent sign.

              %a     File's last access time in the format returned by the C <b><a href="../man3/ctime.3.html">ctime</a></b>(3) function.

              %A<u>k</u>    File's last access time in the format specified by <u>k</u>, which is either `@'  or  a  directive
                     for  the C <b><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a></b>(3) function.  The following shows an incomplete list of possible values
                     for <u>k</u>.  Please refer to the documentation of <b><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a></b>(3) for the full list.   Some  of  the
                     conversion  specification  characters  might  not  be  available  on  all  systems,  due to
                     differences in the implementation of the <b><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a></b>(3) library function.

                     +      Date and time, separated by `+', for example `2004-04-28+22:22:05.0'.  This is a GNU
                            extension.  The time is given in the current timezone  (which  may  be  affected  by
                            setting the <b>TZ</b> environment variable).  The seconds field includes a fractional part.

                     X      locale's time representation (H:M:S).  The seconds field includes a fractional part.

                     Z      time zone (e.g., EDT), or nothing if no time zone is determinable

                     Date fields:

                     c      locale's  date  and  time (Sat Nov 04 12:02:33 EST 1989).  The format is the same as
                            for <b><a href="../man3/ctime.3.html">ctime</a></b>(3) and so  to  preserve  compatibility  with  that  format,  there  is  no
                            fractional part in the seconds field.

              %b     The  amount  of  disk  space  used  for  this file in 512-byte blocks.  Since disk space is
                     allocated in multiples of the filesystem block size this is usually  greater  than  %s/512,
                     but it can also be smaller if the file is a sparse file.

              %B<u>k</u>    File's birth time, i.e., its creation time, in the format specified by <u>k</u>, which is the same
                     as  for  %A.  This directive produces an empty string if the underlying operating system or
                     filesystem does not support birth times.

              %c     File's last status change time in the format returned by the C <b><a href="../man3/ctime.3.html">ctime</a></b>(3) function.

              %C<u>k</u>    File's last status change time in the format specified by <u>k</u>, which is the same as for %A.

              %d     File's depth in the directory tree; 0 means the file is a starting-point.

              %D     The device number on which the file exists (the st_dev field of struct stat), in decimal.

              %f     Print the basename; the file's name with any leading directories  removed  (only  the  last
                     element).  For <b>/</b>, the result is `/'.  See the <b>EXAMPLES</b> section for an example.

              %F     Type of the filesystem the file is on; this value can be used for -fstype.

              %g     File's group name, or numeric group ID if the group has no name.

              %G     File's numeric group ID.

              %h     Dirname;  the  Leading  directories  of the file's name (all but the last element).  If the
                     file name contains no slashes (since it is in  the  current  directory)  the  %h  specifier
                     expands  to `.'.  For files which are themselves directories and contain a slash (including
                     <b>/</b>), %h expands to the empty string.  See the <b>EXAMPLES</b> section for an example.

              %H     Starting-point under which file was found.

              %i     File's inode number (in decimal).

              %k     The amount of disk space used for this file in 1 KB blocks.  Since disk space is  allocated
                     in  multiples of the filesystem block size this is usually greater than %s/1024, but it can
                     also be smaller if the file is a sparse file.

              %l     Object of symbolic link (empty string if file is not a symbolic link).

              %m     File's permission bits (in octal).  This option uses the `traditional' numbers  which  most
                     Unix implementations use, but if your particular implementation uses an unusual ordering of
                     octal  permissions  bits,  you will see a difference between the actual value of the file's
                     mode and the output of %m.  Normally you will want to have a leading zero on  this  number,
                     and to do this, you should use the <b>#</b> flag (as in, for example, `%#m').

              %M     File's permissions (in symbolic form, as for <b>ls</b>).  This directive is supported in findutils
                     4.2.5 and later.

              %n     Number of hard links to file.

              %p     File's name.

              %P     File's name with the name of the starting-point under which it was found removed.

              %s     File's size in bytes.

              %S     File's sparseness.  This is calculated as (BLOCKSIZE*st_blocks / st_size).  The exact value
                     you  will  get  for  an  ordinary  file  of a certain length is system-dependent.  However,
                     normally sparse files will have values less than 1.0, and files which use  indirect  blocks
                     may have a value which is greater than 1.0.  In general the number of blocks used by a file
                     is file system dependent.  The value used for BLOCKSIZE is system-dependent, but is usually
                     512  bytes.   If  the  file size is zero, the value printed is undefined.  On systems which
                     lack support for st_blocks, a file's sparseness is assumed to be 1.0.

              %t     File's last modification time in the format returned by the C <b><a href="../man3/ctime.3.html">ctime</a></b>(3) function.

              %T<u>k</u>    File's last modification time in the format specified by <u>k</u>, which is the same as for %A.

              %u     File's user name, or numeric user ID if the user has no name.

              %U     File's numeric user ID.

              %y     File's type (like in <b>ls</b> <b>-l</b>), U=unknown type (shouldn't happen)

              %Y     File's type (like %y), plus follow symbolic links: `L'=loop, `N'=nonexistent, `?'  for  any
                     other error when determining the type of the target of a symbolic link.

              %Z     (SELinux only) file's security context.

              %{ %[ %(
                     Reserved for future use.

              A  `%'  character followed by any other character is discarded, but the other character is printed
              (don't rely on this, as further format characters may be introduced).  A `%' at  the  end  of  the
              format  argument  causes  undefined  behaviour  since  there  is  no following character.  In some
              locales, it may hide your door keys, while in others it may remove the final page from  the  novel
              you are reading.

              The  %m  and  %d directives support the <b>#</b>, <b>0</b> and <b>+</b> flags, but the other directives do not, even if
              they print numbers.  Numeric directives that do not support these flags include <b>G</b>, <b>U</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>k</b>  and
              <b>n</b>.   The  `-'  format  flag is supported and changes the alignment of a field from right-justified
              (which is the default) to left-justified.

              See the <b>UNUSUAL</b> <b>FILENAMES</b> section for information about how unusual characters  in  filenames  are
              handled.

       -prune True;  if the file is a directory, do not descend into it.  If <b>-depth</b> is given, then <b>-prune</b> has no
              effect.  Because <b>-delete</b> implies <b>-depth</b>, you cannot usefully use <b>-prune</b> and <b>-delete</b> together.  For
              example, to skip the directory <u>src/emacs</u> and all files and directories under  it,  and  print  the
              names of the other files found, do something like this:
                  find . -path ./src/emacs -prune -o -print

       -quit  Exit immediately (with return value zero if no errors have occurred).  This is different to <b>-prune</b>
              because  <b>-prune</b>  only applies to the contents of pruned directories, while <b>-quit</b> simply makes <b>find</b>
              stop immediately.  No child processes will be left running.  Any command  lines  which  have  been
              built  by  <b>-exec</b> <b>...</b> <b>+</b> or <b>-execdir</b> <b>...</b> <b>+</b> are invoked before the program is exited.  After <b>-quit</b> is
              executed, no  more  files  specified  on  the  command  line  will  be  processed.   For  example,
              `<b>find</b> <u>/tmp/foo</u> <u>/tmp/bar</u> <b>-print</b> <b>-quit</b>` will print only `/tmp/foo`.
              One common use of <b>-quit</b> is to stop searching the file system once we have found what we want.  For
              example, if we want to find just a single file we can do this:
                  find / -name needle -print -quit

   <b>OPERATORS</b>
       Listed in order of decreasing precedence:

       ( <u>expr</u> )
              Force  precedence.   Since  parentheses  are special to the shell, you will normally need to quote
              them.  Many of the examples in this manual  page  use  backslashes  for  this  purpose:  `\(...\)'
              instead of `(...)'.

       ! <u>expr</u> True  if  <u>expr</u>  is false.  This character will also usually need protection from interpretation by
              the shell.

       -not <u>expr</u>
              Same as ! <u>expr</u>, but not POSIX compliant.

       <u>expr1</u> <u>expr2</u>
              Two expressions in a row are taken to be joined with an implied <b>-a</b>;  <u>expr2</u>  is  not  evaluated  if
              <u>expr1</u> is false.

       <u>expr1</u> -a <u>expr2</u>
              Same as <u>expr1</u> <u>expr2</u>.

       <u>expr1</u> -and <u>expr2</u>
              Same as <u>expr1</u> <u>expr2</u>, but not POSIX compliant.

       <u>expr1</u> -o <u>expr2</u>
              Or; <u>expr2</u> is not evaluated if <u>expr1</u> is true.

       <u>expr1</u> -or <u>expr2</u>
              Same as <u>expr1</u> <b>-o</b> <u>expr2</u>, but not POSIX compliant.

       <u>expr1</u> , <u>expr2</u>
              List;  both  <u>expr1</u>  and <u>expr2</u> are always evaluated.  The value of <u>expr1</u> is discarded; the value of
              the list is the value of <u>expr2</u>.  The comma operator  can  be  useful  for  searching  for  several
              different  types of thing, but traversing the filesystem hierarchy only once.  The <b>-fprintf</b> action
              can be used to list the various matched items into several different output files.

       Please note that <b>-a</b> when specified implicitly (for example by two tests  appearing  without  an  explicit
       operator  between  them) or explicitly has higher precedence than <b>-o</b>.  This means that <b>find</b> <b>.</b> <b>-name</b> <b>afile</b>
       <b>-o</b> <b>-name</b> <b>bfile</b> <b>-print</b> will never print <u>afile</u>.

</pre><h4><b>UNUSUAL</b> <b>FILENAMES</b></h4><pre>
       Many of the actions of <b>find</b> result in the printing of data which is under the  control  of  other  users.
       This  includes  file  names,  sizes, modification times and so forth.  File names are a potential problem
       since they can contain any character except `\0' and `/'.   Unusual  characters  in  file  names  can  do
       unexpected  and  often  undesirable  things  to your terminal (for example, changing the settings of your
       function keys on some terminals).  Unusual characters are handled  differently  by  various  actions,  as
       described below.

       -print0, -fprint0
              Always print the exact filename, unchanged, even if the output is going to a terminal.

       -ls, -fls
              Unusual  characters  are  always escaped.  White space, backslash, and double quote characters are
              printed using C-style escaping (for example `\f', `\"').  Other  unusual  characters  are  printed
              using  an  octal  escape.   Other  printable characters (for <b>-ls</b> and <b>-fls</b> these are the characters
              between octal 041 and 0176) are printed as-is.

       -printf, -fprintf
              If the output is not going to a terminal, it is printed as-is.  Otherwise, the result  depends  on
              which  directive  is in use.  The directives %D, %F, %g, %G, %H, %Y, and %y expand to values which
              are not under control of files' owners, and so are printed as-is.  The directives %a, %b, %c,  %d,
              %i, %k, %m, %M, %n, %s, %t, %u and %U have values which are under the control of files' owners but
              which  cannot be used to send arbitrary data to the terminal, and so these are printed as-is.  The
              directives %f, %h, %l, %p and %P are quoted.  This quoting is performed in the same way as for GNU
              <b>ls</b>.  This is not the same quoting mechanism as the one used for <b>-ls</b> and <b>-fls</b>.  If you are able  to
              decide  what  format  to  use  for  the output of <b>find</b> then it is normally better to use `\0' as a
              terminator than to use newline, as file names can contain white space and newline characters.  The
              setting of the <b>LC_CTYPE</b> environment variable is used to determine  which  characters  need  to  be
              quoted.

       -print, -fprint
              Quoting is handled in the same way as for <b>-printf</b> and <b>-fprintf</b>.  If you are using <b>find</b> in a script
              or  in  a  situation where the matched files might have arbitrary names, you should consider using
              <b>-print0</b> instead of <b>-print</b>.

       The <b>-ok</b> and <b>-okdir</b> actions print the current filename as-is.  This may change in a future release.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b> <b>CONFORMANCE</b></h4><pre>
       For closest compliance to the POSIX standard, you should set the  <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b>  environment  variable.
       The following options are specified in the POSIX standard (IEEE Std 1003.1-2008, 2016 Edition):

       <b>-H</b>     This option is supported.

       <b>-L</b>     This option is supported.

       <b>-name</b>  This  option  is supported, but POSIX conformance depends on the POSIX conformance of the system's
              <b><a href="../man3/fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch</a></b>(3) library function.  As of findutils-4.2.2, shell metacharacters (`*', `?'  or  `[]'  for
              example)  match  a  leading  `.',  because  IEEE PASC interpretation 126 requires this.  This is a
              change from previous versions of findutils.

       <b>-type</b>  Supported.  POSIX specifies `b', `c', `d', `l', `p', `f' and `s'.  GNU  find  also  supports  `D',
              representing  a Door, where the OS provides these.  Furthermore, GNU find allows multiple types to
              be specified at once in a comma-separated list.

       <b>-ok</b>    Supported.  Interpretation of the response is according to the `yes' and `no' patterns selected by
              setting the <b>LC_MESSAGES</b> environment variable.  When the <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b>  environment  variable  is
              set,  these  patterns are taken system's definition of a positive (yes) or negative (no) response.
              See the system's documentation  for  <b><a href="../man3/nl_langinfo.3.html">nl_langinfo</a></b>(3),  in  particular  YESEXPR  and  NOEXPR.   When
              <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b> is not set, the patterns are instead taken from <b>find</b>'s own message catalogue.

       <b>-newer</b> Supported.  If the file specified is a symbolic link, it is always dereferenced.  This is a change
              from  previous  behaviour,  which  used  to take the relevant time from the symbolic link; see the
              HISTORY section below.

       <b>-perm</b>  Supported.  If the <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b> environment variable is  not  set,  some  mode  arguments  (for
              example +a+x) which are not valid in POSIX are supported for backward-compatibility.

       Other primaries
              The  primaries  <b>-atime</b>,  <b>-ctime</b>,  <b>-depth</b>,  <b>-exec</b>,  <b>-group</b>, <b>-links</b>, <b>-mtime</b>, <b>-nogroup</b>, <b>-nouser</b>, <b>-ok</b>,
              <b>-path</b>, <b>-print</b>, <b>-prune</b>, <b>-size</b>, <b>-user</b> and <b>-xdev</b> are all supported.

       The POSIX standard specifies parentheses `(', `)', negation `!' and the logical AND/OR operators  <b>-a</b>  and
       <b>-o</b>.

       All  other  options, predicates, expressions and so forth are extensions beyond the POSIX standard.  Many
       of these extensions are not unique to GNU find, however.

       The POSIX standard requires that <b>find</b> detects loops:

              The <b>find</b> utility shall detect infinite loops; that is, entering  a  previously  visited  directory
              that  is  an  ancestor of the last file encountered.  When it detects an infinite loop, <b>find</b> shall
              write a diagnostic message to standard  error  and  shall  either  recover  its  position  in  the
              hierarchy or terminate.

       GNU <b>find</b> complies with these requirements.  The link count of directories which contain entries which are
       hard links to an ancestor will often be lower than they otherwise should be.  This can mean that GNU find
       will  sometimes  optimize  away  the  visiting of a subdirectory which is actually a link to an ancestor.
       Since <b>find</b> does not actually enter such a subdirectory, it is allowed  to  avoid  emitting  a  diagnostic
       message.  Although this behaviour may be somewhat confusing, it is unlikely that anybody actually depends
       on  this  behaviour.  If the leaf optimisation has been turned off with <b>-noleaf</b>, the directory entry will
       always be examined and the diagnostic message will be issued where it  is  appropriate.   Symbolic  links
       cannot be used to create filesystem cycles as such, but if the <b>-L</b> option or the <b>-follow</b> option is in use,
       a  diagnostic  message is issued when <b>find</b> encounters a loop of symbolic links.  As with loops containing
       hard links, the leaf optimisation will often mean that <b>find</b> knows that it doesn't need to call <u>stat()</u>  or
       <u>chdir()</u> on the symbolic link, so this diagnostic is frequently not necessary.

       The  <b>-d</b>  option  is  supported  for compatibility with various BSD systems, but you should use the POSIX-
       compliant option <b>-depth</b> instead.

       The <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b> environment variable does not affect the behaviour of the  <b>-regex</b>  or  <b>-iregex</b>  tests
       because those tests aren't specified in the POSIX standard.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       LANG   Provides a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null.

       LC_ALL If  set  to  a  non-empty  string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
              variables.

       LC_COLLATE
              The POSIX standard specifies that this variable affects the pattern matching to be  used  for  the
              <b>-name</b>  option.   GNU  find  uses  the  <b><a href="../man3/fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch</a></b>(3)  library function, and so support for <b>LC_COLLATE</b>
              depends on the system library.  This variable also affects the interpretation of the  response  to
              <b>-ok</b>;  while  the <b>LC_MESSAGES</b> variable selects the actual pattern used to interpret the response to
              <b>-ok</b>, the interpretation of any bracket expressions in the pattern will be affected by <b>LC_COLLATE</b>.

       LC_CTYPE
              This variable affects the treatment of character classes used in regular expressions and also with
              the <b>-name</b> test, if the system's <b><a href="../man3/fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch</a></b>(3) library function supports  this.   This  variable  also
              affects  the  interpretation of any character classes in the regular expressions used to interpret
              the response to the prompt issued by <b>-ok</b>.  The <b>LC_CTYPE</b>  environment  variable  will  also  affect
              which  characters  are  considered  to  be unprintable when filenames are printed; see the section
              UNUSUAL FILENAMES.

       LC_MESSAGES
              Determines the  locale  to  be  used  for  internationalised  messages.   If  the  <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b>
              environment variable is set, this also determines the interpretation of the response to the prompt
              made by the <b>-ok</b> action.

       NLSPATH
              Determines the location of the internationalisation message catalogues.

       PATH   Affects the directories which are searched to find the executables invoked by <b>-exec</b>, <b>-execdir</b>, <b>-ok</b>
              and <b>-okdir</b>.

       POSIXLY_CORRECT
              Determines  the  block  size used by <b>-ls</b> and <b>-fls</b>.  If <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b> is set, blocks are units of
              512 bytes.  Otherwise they are units of 1024 bytes.

              Setting this variable also turns off warning messages  (that  is,  implies  <b>-nowarn</b>)  by  default,
              because  POSIX  requires  that  apart  from the output for <b>-ok</b>, all messages printed on stderr are
              diagnostics and must result in a non-zero exit status.

              When <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b> is not set, <b>-perm</b> <u>+zzz</u> is treated just like <b>-perm</b> <u>/zzz</u> if <u>+zzz</u> is not a valid
              symbolic mode.  When <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b> is set, such constructs are treated as an error.

              When <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b> is set, the response to the prompt made by  the  <b>-ok</b>  action  is  interpreted
              according  to  the  system's  message  catalogue,  as  opposed  to according to <b>find</b>'s own message
              translations.

       TZ     Affects the time zone used for some of the time-related format directives of <b>-printf</b> and <b>-fprintf</b>.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Simple</b> <b>`find|xargs`</b> <b>approach</b>
       •      Find files named <u>core</u> in or below the directory <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u> and delete them.

                  <b>$</b> <b>find</b> <b><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></b> <b>-name</b> <b>core</b> <b>-type</b> <b>f</b> <b>-print</b> <b>|</b> <b>xargs</b> <b><a href="file:/bin/rm">/bin/rm</a></b> <b>-f</b>

              Note that this will work incorrectly if there are any filenames  containing  newlines,  single  or
              double quotes, or spaces.

   <b>Safer</b> <b>`find</b> <b>-print0</b> <b>|</b> <b>xargs</b> <b>-0`</b> <b>approach</b>
       •      Find files named <u>core</u> in or below the directory <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u> and delete them, processing filenames in such
              a  way  that  file  or  directory names containing single or double quotes, spaces or newlines are
              correctly handled.

                  <b>$</b> <b>find</b> <b><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></b> <b>-name</b> <b>core</b> <b>-type</b> <b>f</b> <b>-print0</b> <b>|</b> <b>xargs</b> <b>-0</b> <b><a href="file:/bin/rm">/bin/rm</a></b> <b>-f</b>

              The <b>-name</b> test comes before the <b>-type</b> test in order to avoid having to call <b><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></b>(2) on every file.

       Note that there is still a race between the time <b>find</b>  traverses  the  hierarchy  printing  the  matching
       filenames, and the time the process executed by <b>xargs</b> works with that file.

   <b>Processing</b> <b>arbitrary</b> <b>starting</b> <b>points</b>
       •      Given  that  another  program  <u>proggy</u>  pre-filters and creates a huge NUL-separated list of files,
              process those as starting points, and find all regular, empty files among them:

                  <b>$</b> <b>proggy</b> <b>|</b> <b>find</b> <b>-files0-from</b> <b>-</b> <b>-maxdepth</b> <b>0</b> <b>-type</b> <b>f</b> <b>-empty</b>

              The use of <b>`-files0-from</b> <b>-`</b> means to read the names of the starting points  from  <u>standard</u>  <u>input</u>,
              i.e.,  from  the  pipe;  and  <b>-maxdepth</b> <b>0</b>  ensures that only explicitly those entries are examined
              without recursing into directories (in the case one of the starting points is one).

   <b>Executing</b> <b>a</b> <b>command</b> <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>file</b>
       •      Run <u>file</u> on every file in or below the current directory.

                  <b>$</b> <b>find</b> <b>.</b> <b>-type</b> <b>f</b> <b>-exec</b> <b>file</b> <b>'{}'</b> <b>\;</b>

              Notice that the braces are enclosed in single quote marks to protect them from  interpretation  as
              shell  script punctuation.  The semicolon is similarly protected by the use of a backslash, though
              single quotes could have been used in that case also.

       In many cases, one might prefer the <b>`-exec</b> <b>...</b> <b>+`</b> or better the <b>`-execdir</b> <b>...</b> <b>+`</b> syntax  for  performance
       and security reasons.

   <b>Traversing</b> <b>the</b> <b>filesystem</b> <b>just</b> <b>once</b> <b>-</b> <b>for</b> <b>2</b> <b>different</b> <b>actions</b>
       •      Traverse  the  filesystem just once, listing set-user-ID files and directories into <u>/root/suid.txt</u>
              and large files into <u>/root/big.txt</u>.

                  <b>$</b> <b>find</b> <b>/</b> <b>\</b>
                      <b>\(</b> <b>-perm</b> <b>-4000</b> <b>-fprintf</b> <b>/root/suid.txt</b> <b>'%#m</b> <b>%u</b> <b>%p\n'</b> <b>\)</b> <b>,</b> <b>\</b>
                      <b>\(</b> <b>-size</b> <b>+100M</b> <b>-fprintf</b> <b>/root/big.txt</b> <b>'%-10s</b> <b>%p\n'</b> <b>\)</b>

              This example uses the line-continuation character '\' on the first two lines to instruct the shell
              to continue reading the command on the next line.

   <b>Searching</b> <b>files</b> <b>by</b> <b>age</b>
       •      Search for files in your home directory which have been modified in the last twenty-four hours.

                  <b>$</b> <b>find</b> <b>$HOME</b> <b>-mtime</b> <b>0</b>

              This command works this way because the time since each file was last modified is  divided  by  24
              hours and any remainder is discarded.  That means that to match <b>-mtime</b> <b>0</b>, a file will have to have
              a modification in the past which is less than 24 hours ago.

   <b>Searching</b> <b>files</b> <b>by</b> <b>permissions</b>
       •      Search for files which are executable but not readable.

                  <b>$</b> <b>find</b> <b><a href="file:/sbin">/sbin</a></b> <b><a href="file:/usr/sbin">/usr/sbin</a></b> <b>-executable</b> <b>\!</b> <b>-readable</b> <b>-print</b>

       •      Search  for files which have read and write permission for their owner, and group, but which other
              users can read but not write to.

                  <b>$</b> <b>find</b> <b>.</b> <b>-perm</b> <b>664</b>

              Files which meet these criteria but have other permissions bits set (for example  if  someone  can
              execute the file) will not be matched.

       •      Search  for  files which have read and write permission for their owner and group, and which other
              users can read, without regard to the presence of any  extra  permission  bits  (for  example  the
              executable bit).

                  <b>$</b> <b>find</b> <b>.</b> <b>-perm</b> <b>-664</b>

              This will match a file which has mode <u>0777</u>, for example.

       •      Search for files which are writable by somebody (their owner, or their group, or anybody else).

                  <b>$</b> <b>find</b> <b>.</b> <b>-perm</b> <b>/222</b>

       •      Search for files which are writable by either their owner or their group.

                  <b>$</b> <b>find</b> <b>.</b> <b>-perm</b> <b>/220</b>
                  <b>$</b> <b>find</b> <b>.</b> <b>-perm</b> <b>/u+w,g+w</b>
                  <b>$</b> <b>find</b> <b>.</b> <b>-perm</b> <b>/u=w,g=w</b>

              All  three of these commands do the same thing, but the first one uses the octal representation of
              the file mode, and the other two use the symbolic form.  The files don't have to  be  writable  by
              both the owner and group to be matched; either will do.

       •      Search for files which are writable by both their owner and their group.

                  <b>$</b> <b>find</b> <b>.</b> <b>-perm</b> <b>-220</b>
                  <b>$</b> <b>find</b> <b>.</b> <b>-perm</b> <b>-g+w,u+w</b>

              Both these commands do the same thing.

       •      A more elaborate search on permissions.

                  <b>$</b> <b>find</b> <b>.</b> <b>-perm</b> <b>-444</b> <b>-perm</b> <b>/222</b> <b>\!</b> <b>-perm</b> <b>/111</b>
                  <b>$</b> <b>find</b> <b>.</b> <b>-perm</b> <b>-a+r</b> <b>-perm</b> <b>/a+w</b> <b>\!</b> <b>-perm</b> <b>/a+x</b>

              These  two  commands  both  search  for files that are readable for everybody (<b>-perm</b> <b>-444</b> or <b>-perm</b>
              <b>-a+r</b>), have at least one write bit set (<b>-perm</b> <b>/222</b> or <b>-perm</b>  <b>/a+w</b>)  but  are  not  executable  for
              anybody (<b>!</b> <b>-perm</b> <b>/111</b> or <b>!</b> <b>-perm</b> <b>/a+x</b> respectively).

   <b>Pruning</b> <b>-</b> <b>omitting</b> <b>files</b> <b>and</b> <b>subdirectories</b>
       •      Copy the contents of <u>/source-dir</u> to <u>/dest-dir</u>, but omit files and directories named <u>.snapshot</u> (and
              anything  in  them).   It  also  omits  files or directories whose name ends in `~', but not their
              contents.

                  <b>$</b> <b>cd</b> <b>/source-dir</b>
                  <b>$</b> <b>find</b> <b>.</b> <b>-name</b> <b>.snapshot</b> <b>-prune</b> <b>-o</b> <b>\(</b> <b>\!</b> <b>-name</b> <b>'*~'</b> <b>-print0</b> <b>\)</b> <b>\</b>
                      <b>|</b> <b>cpio</b> <b>-pmd0</b> <b>/dest-dir</b>

              The construct <b>-prune</b> <b>-o</b> <b>\(</b> <b>...</b> <b>-print0</b> <b>\)</b> is quite common.  The idea here is that  the  expression
              before  <b>-prune</b>  matches  things which are to be pruned.  However, the <b>-prune</b> action itself returns
              true, so the following <b>-o</b> ensures that the right hand side is evaluated only for those directories
              which didn't get pruned (the contents of the pruned directories are not  even  visited,  so  their
              contents  are irrelevant).  The expression on the right hand side of the <b>-o</b> is in parentheses only
              for clarity.  It emphasises that the <b>-print0</b> action takes place only for things that  didn't  have
              <b>-prune</b> applied to them.  Because the default `and' condition between tests binds more tightly than
              <b>-o</b>, this is the default anyway, but the parentheses help to show what is going on.

       •      Given  the  following  directory  of projects and their associated SCM administrative directories,
              perform an efficient search for the projects' roots:

                  <b>$</b> <b>find</b> <b>repo/</b> <b>\</b>
                      <b>\(</b> <b>-exec</b> <b>test</b> <b>-d</b> <b>'{}/.svn'</b> <b>\;</b> <b>\</b>
                      <b>-or</b> <b>-exec</b> <b>test</b> <b>-d</b> <b>'{}/.git'</b> <b>\;</b> <b>\</b>
                      <b>-or</b> <b>-exec</b> <b>test</b> <b>-d</b> <b>'{}/CVS'</b> <b>\;</b> <b>\</b>
                      <b>\)</b> <b>-print</b> <b>-prune</b>

              Sample output:

                  <b>repo/project1/CVS</b>
                  <b>repo/gnu/project2/.svn</b>
                  <b>repo/gnu/project3/.svn</b>
                  <b>repo/gnu/project3/src/.svn</b>
                  <b>repo/project4/.git</b>

              In this example, <b>-prune</b> prevents unnecessary descent  into  directories  that  have  already  been
              discovered (for example we do not search <u>project3/src</u> because we already found <u>project3/.svn</u>), but
              ensures sibling directories (<u>project2</u> and <u>project3</u>) are found.

   <b>Other</b> <b>useful</b> <b>examples</b>
       •      Search for several file types.

                  <b>$</b> <b>find</b> <b><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></b> <b>-type</b> <b>f,d,l</b>

              Search  for  files, directories, and symbolic links in the directory <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u> passing these types as a
              comma-separated list (GNU extension), which is  otherwise  equivalent  to  the  longer,  yet  more
              portable:

                  <b>$</b> <b>find</b> <b><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></b> <b>\(</b> <b>-type</b> <b>f</b> <b>-o</b> <b>-type</b> <b>d</b> <b>-o</b> <b>-type</b> <b>l</b> <b>\)</b>

       •      Search for files with the particular name <u>needle</u> and stop immediately when we find the first one.

                  <b>$</b> <b>find</b> <b>/</b> <b>-name</b> <b>needle</b> <b>-print</b> <b>-quit</b>

       •      Demonstrate  the  interpretation of the <b>%f</b> and <b>%h</b> format directives of the <b>-printf</b> action for some
              corner-cases.  Here is an example including some output.

                  <b>$</b> <b>find</b> <b>.</b> <b>..</b> <b>/</b> <b><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></b> <b>/tmp/TRACE</b> <b>compile</b> <b>compile/64/tests/find</b> <b>-maxdepth</b> <b>0</b> <b>-printf</b> <b>'[%h][%f]\n'</b>
                  <b>[.][.]</b>
                  <b>[.][..]</b>
                  <b>[][/]</b>
                  <b>[][tmp]</b>
                  <b>[<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>][TRACE]</b>
                  <b>[.][compile]</b>
                  <b>[compile/64/tests][find]</b>

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>find</b> exits with status 0 if all files are processed successfully, greater than 0 if errors  occur.   This
       is deliberately a very broad description, but if the return value is non-zero, you should not rely on the
       correctness of the results of <b>find</b>.

       When  some  error  occurs,  <b>find</b> may stop immediately, without completing all the actions specified.  For
       example, some starting points may not  have  been  examined  or  some  pending  program  invocations  for
       <b>-exec</b> <b>...</b> <b>{}</b> <b>+</b> or <b>-execdir</b> <b>...</b> <b>{}</b> <b>+</b> may not have been performed.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       A  <b>find</b>  program appeared in Version 5 Unix as part of the Programmer's Workbench project and was written
       by Dick Haight.  Doug McIlroy's <u>A</u> <u>Research</u> <u>UNIX</u> <u>Reader:</u> <u>Annotated</u> <u>Excerpts</u> <u>from</u> <u>the</u> <u>Programmer’s</u>  <u>Manual,</u>
       <u>1971-1986</u>     provides     some     additional     details;     you    can    read    it    on-line    at
       &lt;https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/reader.pdf&gt;.

       GNU <b>find</b> was originally written by Eric Decker, with enhancements by David MacKenzie, Jay Plett, and  Tim
       Wood.  The idea for <b>find</b> <b>-print0</b> and <b>xargs</b> <b>-0</b> came from Dan Bernstein.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       As  of  findutils-4.2.2,  shell  metacharacters  (`*', `?' or `[]' for example) used in filename patterns
       match a leading `.', because IEEE POSIX interpretation 126 requires this.

       As of findutils-4.3.3, <b>-perm</b> <b>/000</b> now matches all files instead of none.

       Nanosecond-resolution timestamps were implemented in findutils-4.3.3.

       As of findutils-4.3.11, the <b>-delete</b> action sets <b>find</b>'s exit status to a  nonzero  value  when  it  fails.
       However, <b>find</b> will not exit immediately.  Previously, <b>find</b>'s exit status was unaffected by the failure of
       <b>-delete</b>.
       Feature                Added in   Also occurs in
       -files0-from           4.9.0

       -ipath                 3.8
       -iregex                3.8

       The  syntax  <b>-perm</b> <b>+MODE</b> was removed in findutils-4.5.12, in favour of <b>-perm</b> <b>/MODE</b>.  The <b>+MODE</b> syntax had
       been deprecated since findutils-4.2.21 which was released in 2005.

</pre><h4><b>NON-BUGS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Operator</b> <b>precedence</b> <b>surprises</b>
       The command <b>find</b> <b>.</b> <b>-name</b> <b>afile</b> <b>-o</b> <b>-name</b> <b>bfile</b> <b>-print</b> will never print  <u>afile</u>  because  this  is  actually
       equivalent  to  <b>find</b> <b>.</b> <b>-name</b> <b>afile</b> <b>-o</b> <b>\(</b> <b>-name</b> <b>bfile</b> <b>-a</b> <b>-print</b> <b>\)</b>.  Remember that the precedence of <b>-a</b> is
       higher than that of <b>-o</b> and when there is no operator specified between tests, <b>-a</b> is assumed.

   <b>“paths</b> <b>must</b> <b>precede</b> <b>expression”</b> <b>error</b> <b>message</b>
       <b>$</b> <b>find</b> <b>.</b> <b>-name</b> <b>*.c</b> <b>-print</b>
       find: paths must precede expression
       find: possible unquoted pattern after predicate `-name'?

       This happens when the shell could expand the pattern <u>*.c</u> to more than  one  file  name  existing  in  the
       current directory, and passing the resulting file names in the command line to <b>find</b> like this:
       <b>find</b> <b>.</b> <b>-name</b> <b>frcode.c</b> <b>locate.c</b> <b>word_io.c</b> <b>-print</b>
       That  command is of course not going to work, because the <b>-name</b> predicate allows exactly only one pattern
       as argument.  Instead of doing things this way, you should enclose the pattern in quotes  or  escape  the
       wildcard,  thus  allowing  <b>find</b>  to  use  the  pattern  with the wildcard during the search for file name
       matching instead of file names expanded by the parent shell:
       <b>$</b> <b>find</b> <b>.</b> <b>-name</b> <b>'*.c'</b> <b>-print</b>
       <b>$</b> <b>find</b> <b>.</b> <b>-name</b> <b>\*.c</b> <b>-print</b>

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       There are security problems inherent in the behaviour that the POSIX standard specifies for  <b>find</b>,  which
       therefore  cannot be fixed.  For example, the <b>-exec</b> action is inherently insecure, and <b>-execdir</b> should be
       used instead.

       The environment variable <b>LC_COLLATE</b> has no effect on the <b>-ok</b> action.
