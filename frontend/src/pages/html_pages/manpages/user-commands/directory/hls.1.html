       hls - list files in an HFS directory

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       hls [<u>options</u>] [<u>hfs-path</u> ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hls</b>  lists  files  and  directories  contained in an HFS volume. If one or more arguments are given, each
       specified file or directory is shown; otherwise, the contents of the current working directory are shown.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -1     Output is formatted such that each entry appears on a single line. This is the default when stdout
              is not a terminal.

       -a     All files and directories are shown, including "invisible" files, as would  be  perceived  by  the
              Macintosh Finder. Normally invisible files are omitted from directory listings.

       -b     Special  characters  are  displayed  in  an  escaped  backslash notation. Normally special or non-
              printable characters in filenames are replaced by a question mark (?).

       -c     Sort and display entries by their creation date, rather than their modification date.

       -d     List directory entries themselves rather than their contents. Normally the contents are shown  for
              named directories on the command-line.

       -f     Do  not  sort directory contents; list them in the order they appear in the directory. This option
              effectively enables -a and -U and disables -l, -s, and -t.

       -i     Show the catalog IDs for each entry. Every file and directory  on  an  HFS  volume  has  a  unique
              catalog ID.

       -l     Display  entries  in  long  format. This format shows the entry type ("d" for directory or "f" for
              file), flags ("i" for invisible), file type and creator (four-character strings for  files  only),
              size  (number  of  directory  sub-contents or file resource and data bytes, respectively), date of
              last modification (or creation,  with  -c  flag),  and  pathname.  Macintosh  "locked"  files  are
              indicated by "F" in place of "f".

       -m     Display entries in a continuous format separated by commas.

       -q     Replace  special and non-printable characters in displayed filenames with question marks (?). This
              is the default when stdout is connected to a terminal.

       -r     Sort entries in reverse order before displaying.

       -s     Show the file size for each entry in 1K block units. The size includes blocks used for  both  data
              and resource forks.

       -t     Sort and display entries by time. Normally files will be sorted by name. This option uses the last
              modification date to sort unless -c is also specified.

       -x     Display entries in column format like -C, but sorted horizontally into rows rather than columns.

       -w <u>width</u>
              Format  output  lines  suitable  for  display  in  the  given  <u>width</u>.   Normally the width will be
              determined from your terminal, from the environment variable COLUMNS, or from a default  value  of
              80.

       -C     Display entries in column format with entries sorted vertically. This is the default output format
              when stdout is connected to a terminal.

       -F     Cause  certain output filenames to be followed by a single-character flag indicating the nature of
              the entry; directories are followed by a colon  (:)  and  executable  Macintosh  applications  are
              followed by an asterisk (*).

       -N     Cause all filenames to be output verbatim without any escaping or question-mark substitution.

       -Q     Cause  all  filenames to be enclosed within double-quotes (") and special/non-printable characters
              to be properly escaped.

       -R     For each directory that is encountered in a listing, recursively  descend  into  and  display  its
              contents.

       -S     Sort  and  display  entries by size. For files, the combined resource and data lengths are used to
              compute a file's size.

       -U     Do not sort directory contents; list them in the order  they  appear  in  the  directory.  On  HFS
              volumes,  this  is  usually  an  alphabetical  case-insensitive  ordering, although there are some
              idiosyncrasies to the Macintosh implementation of ordering. This option does not affect -a, -l, or
              -s.
