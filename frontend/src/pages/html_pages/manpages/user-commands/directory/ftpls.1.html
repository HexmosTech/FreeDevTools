</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ftpls - generate a ftp directory listing.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       ftpls [options] host[:port] [remotedir]
          or: ftpls [options] URL

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       ftpls  generates  a  listing  of  files  and directories in a FTP directory. By default it prints a human
       readable ascii output, but may also create HTML and machine parsable output.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Connect</b> <b>/</b> <b>login</b> <b>/</b> <b>username</b> <b>/</b> <b>password</b> <b>options:</b>
       -u, --user=NAME
              Use <u>NAME</u> to login on the ftp server.
              The default is `anonymous'. Use an empty name to force the program to not log in.

       -p, --pass=PASSWORD
              Use PASS as password to login on the ftp server.
              The default is `<a href="mailto:anonymous@invalid.example">anonymous@invalid.example</a>'. If an empty password is given the  programm  will  not
              send a password to the server.

       --account=ACCOUNT
              Send <u>ACCOUNT</u> as account name during login phase.
              Note:  this  is _not_ the user name, but the name of what could be called a subaccount implemented
              by a few servers. If you don't understand what it means you have a good chance to never need  this
              option anyway. If you think you need it please try the --user option first.

       --tries=ARG
              Number of tries to connect and log in.
              The default is 1, meaning that the program will give up after the first error.
              This option was added in version 0.3.0.

       --data-connect-retries=ARG
              Number of tries to connect to data port.
              The  program  will  try to reach the data port (for retrieval of listings or data) that many times
              and will give up after that many errors in a row. The default is 5, meaning that the program  will
              give up after the fifth error.
              This option was added in version 0.6.6. The old behaviour was to give up after the first error.

       --login-sleep=ARG
              Seconds to sleep after a failed login.
              More  precisely:  the  program  will fall to sleep for this many seconds after a try to connect or
              login has failed. The default is 5. A 0 is treated as  1,  and  abuse,  especially  together  with
              --tries, is likely to annory the servers adminstrators.
              This option was added in version 0.4.5.

       -4, --v4
              Only use IPv4, even if v6 is available.
              This option effectively disallows the use of IPv6, except for DNS queries.
              It was added in version 0.6.0.

       -6, --v6
              Only use IPv6, even if v4 is available.
              This option effectively disallows the use of IPv4, except for DNS queries.
              It was added in version 0.6.0.

   <b>Operational</b> <b>options:</b>
       --interactive
              Read directories from stdin.
              This  option  tells  ftpls  to  ignore  any directories given on the command line, and to read the
              directories to list from the standard input, reading one directory per line.ftpls  will  print  an
              END-OF-COPY line after each operation. Do not use this option together with --html.
              This  option  was  added  in  version 0.3.6 and will be removed in future versions, unless someone
              objects.

       -T, --timeout=SECONDS
              Timeout to use for network read/write.
              The default is 30 seconds and is usually sufficient.
              This option was added in version 0.3.8.

       -R, --recursive
              Do recursive listing.
              This option makes ftpls descend through the directory hierarchy and list all the  directories  and
              files  it  files.  A  top  level  directories  content  will  be printed completely before the sub
              directories will be traversed.

       --raw  Raw output in original format.
              This will preserve the original format and sort order.

       --max-depth=ARG
              Descend at most LEVEL directories.
                0 means `do not enter sub directories at all',
                1 means `enter sub-directories, but not their sub-directories'.
              The default is 2^32-1 meaning `enter all'.
              This option enables the --recursive option.

   <b>Sorting</b> <b>options:</b>
       -a, --alpha
              sort alphabetical.

       -z, --omega
              sort reverse alphabetical.

       -n, --newest
              sort youngest first.

       -o, --oldest
              sort oldest first.

       -s, --shortest
              sort shortest first.

       -l, --longest
              sort longest first.

   <b>Output</b> <b>options:</b>
       -h, --html
              OBSOLETE: Create HTML index.
              This option is no longer supported.

       -m, --machine
              Create machine parsable output.

       -t, --title=TEXT
              Title text to use on the HTML output.

       -U, --urlprefix=URL
              <u>URL</u>-Prefix to use in listings.
              If this option is not given then an <u>URL</u> given on the command line will be  used  instead,  and  if
              this  has not been given an <u>URL</u> will be created from host, port and directory given on the command
              line.

       --print-dir
              Print sub directory names.
              This  option makes ftpls print the name of a directory before it lists it's content. Note that the
              name of the top level directory of each listing will not be printed. This option is  meant  to  be
              used together with --raw, and will not create useful output together with --html.

   <b>Workaround</b> <b>options:</b>
       --ascii-listings
              Do directory listings in ASCII mode.
              Use  this  option  if  the  FTP server is unable to correctly list directories in binary mode, for
              example, if you see a message like this (usually on one line):
              `fatal: received unwanted answer to LIST: 426 Data connection: Illegal seek.'
              This option was added in version 0.5.2.

       -L, --list-options=OPTS
              Add <u>OPTS</u> to LIST command.
              This allows to pass arbitrary options to the FTP servers LIST command. Note that ftpcopy does  not
              cope well with recursive directory listings.
              This option was added in version 0.3.0.

       --allow-pasv-ip=IP4
              Allow data connections to the address <u>IP4</u>.
              Normally  ftpls  only accepts data connections to the IP addresses it received as an answer to the
              DNS request, or the IP address in the URL. Sometimes this is not enough, especially  when  NAT  or
              masquerading  are  active.  ftpcopy then prints an error message `illegal redirect by FTP server'.
              With this option, which may be given more than once, you  can  add  additional  addresses  to  the
              internal  list of allowed data connection targets. <u>IP4</u> has to be an IPv4 address or a list of IPv4
              addresses, separated by commas.
              The environment variable FTPCOPY_ALLOW_PASV_IP serves the same purpose.
              Note: Do not use this option without thinking: FTP redirects may  be  used  to  launch  denial  of
              service attacks against innocent targets.
              This option was added in version 0.6.1.

       --force-select
              Use select, not poll.
              Do  not  use  the poll() system call even if it's available, but use select() instead. This allows
              the program to be used together with runsocks from the socks5 reference implementation.
              Please note that you will need a directly reachable name server anyway, as the DNS library in  use
              does not support SOCKS (you can always use IP addresses).
              This option was added in version 0.3.8.

   <b>Help</b> <b>options:</b>
       --examples
              Show usage examples.

       --see-also
              Where to find related information.

       --version
              Show version: ftpls (ftpcopy) 0.6.7.

       --help Show a list of options or the long help on one.
              The use with an argument shows the long help text
              of that option, without an argument it will list
              all options.

       --longhelp
              Show longer help texts for all or one option.
