</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       virt-ls - List files in a virtual machine

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        virt-ls [--options] -d domname directory [directory ...]

        virt-ls [--options] -a disk.img [-a disk.img ...] directory [directory ...]

       Old style:

        virt-ls [--options] domname directory

        virt-ls [--options] disk.img [disk.img ...] directory

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "virt-ls" lists filenames, file sizes, checksums, extended attributes and more from a virtual machine or
       disk image.

       Multiple directory names can be given, in which case the output from each is concatenated.

       To list directories from a libvirt guest use the <u>-d</u> option to specify the name of the guest.  For a disk
       image, use the <u>-a</u> option.

       "virt-ls" can do many simple file listings.  For more complicated cases you may need to use <b><a href="../man1/guestfish.1.html">guestfish</a></b>(1),
       or write a program directly to the <b><a href="../man3/guestfs.3.html">guestfs</a></b>(3) API.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Get a list of all files and directories in a virtual machine:

        virt-ls -R -d guest /

       List all setuid or setgid programs in a Linux virtual machine:

        virt-ls -lR -d guest / | grep '^- [42]'

       List all public-writable directories in a Linux virtual machine:

        virt-ls -lR -d guest / | grep '^d ...7'

       List all Unix domain sockets in a Linux virtual machine:

        virt-ls -lR -d guest / | grep '^s'

       List all regular files with filenames ending in ‘.png’:

        virt-ls -lR -d guest / | grep -i '^-.*\.png$'

       To display files larger than 10MB in home directories:

        virt-ls -lR -d guest <a href="file:/home">/home</a> | awk '$3 &gt; 10*1024*1024'

       Find everything modified in the last 7 days:

        virt-ls -lR -d guest --time-days / | awk '$6 &lt;= 7'

       Find regular files modified in the last 24 hours:

        virt-ls -lR -d guest --time-days / | grep '^-' | awk '$6 &lt; 1'

   <b>DIFFERENCES</b> <b>IN</b> <b>SNAPSHOTS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>BACKING</b> <b>FILES</b>
       Although it is possible to use virt-ls to look for differences, since libguestfs ≥ 1.26 a new tool is
       available called <b><a href="../man1/virt-diff.1.html">virt-diff</a></b>(1).

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>MODES</b></h4><pre>
       "virt-ls" has four output modes, controlled by different combinations of the <u>-l</u> and <u>-R</u> options.

   <b>SIMPLE</b> <b>LISTING</b>
       A simple listing is like the ordinary <b><a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</a></b>(1) command:

        $ virt-ls -d guest /
        bin
        boot
        [etc.]

   <b>LONG</b> <b>LISTING</b>
       With the <u>-l</u> (<u>--long</u>) option, the output is like the "ls -l" command (more specifically, like the
       "guestfs_ll" function).

        $ virt-ls -l -d guest /
        total 204
        dr-xr-xr-x.   2 root root   4096 2009-08-25 19:06 bin
        dr-xr-xr-x.   5 root root   3072 2009-08-25 19:06 boot
        [etc.]

       Note that while this is useful for displaying a directory, do not try parsing this output in another
       program.  Use "RECURSIVE LONG LISTING" instead.

   <b>RECURSIVE</b> <b>LISTING</b>
       With the <u>-R</u> (<u>--recursive</u>) option, "virt-ls" lists the names of files and directories recursively:

        $ virt-ls -R -d guest <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>
        foo
        foo/bar
        [etc.]

       To generate this output, "virt-ls" runs the "guestfs_find0" function and converts "\0" characters to
       "\n".

   <b>RECURSIVE</b> <b>LONG</b> <b>LISTING</b>
       Using <u>-lR</u> options together changes the output to display directories recursively, with file stats, and
       optionally other features such as checksums and extended attributes.

       Most of the interesting features of "virt-ls" are only available when using <u>-lR</u> mode.

       The fields are normally space-separated.  Filenames are <b>not</b> quoted, so you cannot use the output in
       another program (because filenames can contain spaces and other unsafe characters).  If the guest was
       untrusted and someone knew you were using "virt-ls" to analyze the guest, they could play tricks on you
       by creating filenames with embedded newline characters.  To <b>safely</b> parse the output in another program,
       use the <u>--csv</u> (Comma-Separated Values) option.

       Note that this output format is completely unrelated to the "ls -lR" command.

        $ virt-ls -lR -d guest <a href="file:/bin">/bin</a>
        d 0555       4096 <a href="file:/bin">/bin</a>
        - 0755        123 /bin/alsaunmute
        - 0755      28328 <a href="file:/bin/arch">/bin/arch</a>
        l 0777          4 <a href="file:/bin/awk">/bin/awk</a> -&gt; gawk
        - 0755      27216 <a href="file:/bin/basename">/bin/basename</a>
        - 0755     943360 <a href="file:/bin/bash">/bin/bash</a>
        [etc.]

       These basic fields are always shown:

       type
           The  file  type,  one  of:  "-"  (regular  file), "d" (directory), "c" (character device), "b" (block
           device), "p" (named pipe), "l" (symbolic link), "s" (socket) or "u" (unknown).

       permissions
           The Unix permissions, displayed as a 4 digit octal number.

       size
           The size of the file.  This is shown in bytes unless <u>-h</u> or <u>--human-readable</u> option is given, in which
           case this is shown as a human-readable number.

       path
           The full path of the file or directory.

       link
           For symbolic links only, the link target.

       In <u>-lR</u> mode, additional command line options enable the display of more fields.

       With the <u>--uids</u> flag, these additional fields are displayed before the path:

       uid
       gid The UID and GID of the owner of the file (displayed numerically).  Note these only make sense in  the
           context of a Unix-like guest.

       With the <u>--times</u> flag, these additional fields are displayed:

       atime
           The time of last access.

       mtime
           The time of last modification.

       ctime
           The time of last status change.

       The  time  fields are displayed as string dates and times, unless one of the <u>--time-t</u>, <u>--time-relative</u> or
       <u>--time-days</u> flags is given.

       With the <u>--extra-stats</u> flag, these additional fields are displayed:

       device
           The device containing the file (displayed as major:minor).  This may not match devices  as  known  to
           the guest.

       inode
           The inode number.

       nlink
           The number of hard links.

       rdev
           For block and char special files, the device (displayed as major:minor).

       blocks
           The number of 512 byte blocks allocated to the file.

       With the <u>--checksum</u> flag, the checksum of the file contents is shown (only for regular files).  Computing
       file checksums can take a considerable amount of time.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--help</b>
           Display brief help.

       <b>-a</b> file
       <b>--add</b> file
           Add  <u>file</u>  which  should be a disk image from a virtual machine.  If the virtual machine has multiple
           block devices, you must supply all of them with separate <u>-a</u> options.

           The format of the disk image is auto-detected.  To override this and force a  particular  format  use
           the <u>--format=..</u> option.

       <b>-a</b> <b>URI</b>
       <b>--add</b> <b>URI</b>
           Add a remote disk.  See "ADDING REMOTE STORAGE" in <b><a href="../man1/guestfish.1.html">guestfish</a></b>(1).

       <b>--blocksize=512</b>
       <b>--blocksize=4096</b>
       <b>--blocksize</b>
           This  parameter  sets  the sector size of the disk image.  It affects all explicitly added subsequent
           disks after this parameter.  Using <u>--blocksize</u> with no argument switches the disk sector size to  the
           default value which is usually 512 bytes.  See also "guestfs_add_drive_opts" in <b><a href="../man3/guestfs.3.html">guestfs</a></b>(3).

       <b>--checksum</b>
       <b>--checksum=crc|md5|sha1|sha224|sha256|sha384|sha512</b>
           Display checksum over file contents for regular files.  With no argument, this defaults to using <u>md5</u>.
           Using an argument, you can select the checksum type to use.

           This option only has effect in <u>-lR</u> output mode.  See "RECURSIVE LONG LISTING" above.

       <b>-c</b> URI
       <b>--connect</b> URI
           If  using  libvirt,  connect  to  the  given <u>URI</u>.  If omitted, then we connect to the default libvirt
           hypervisor.

           If you specify guest block devices directly (<u>-a</u>), then libvirt is not used at all.

       <b>--csv</b>
           Write out the results in CSV format (comma-separated values).  This format  can  be  imported  easily
           into databases and spreadsheets, but read "NOTE ABOUT CSV FORMAT" below.

       <b>-d</b> guest
       <b>--domain</b> guest
           Add all the disks from the named libvirt guest.  Domain UUIDs can be used instead of names.

       <b>--echo-keys</b>
           When  prompting  for  keys and passphrases, virt-ls normally turns echoing off so you cannot see what
           you are typing.  If you are not worried about Tempest attacks and there is no one else  in  the  room
           you can specify this flag to see what you are typing.

       <b>--extra-stats</b>
           Display extra stats.

           This option only has effect in <u>-lR</u> output mode.  See "RECURSIVE LONG LISTING" above.

       <b>--format=raw|qcow2|..</b>
       <b>--format</b>
           The  default for the <u>-a</u> option is to auto-detect the format of the disk image.  Using this forces the
           disk format for <u>-a</u> options which follow on  the  command  line.   Using  <u>--format</u>  with  no  argument
           switches back to auto-detection for subsequent <u>-a</u> options.

           For example:

            virt-ls --format=raw -a disk.img /dir

           forces raw format (no auto-detection) for <u>disk.img</u>.

            virt-ls --format=raw -a disk.img --format -a another.img /dir

           forces raw format (no auto-detection) for <u>disk.img</u> and reverts to auto-detection for <u>another.img</u>.

           If  you  have  untrusted raw-format guest disk images, you should use this option to specify the disk
           format.  This avoids a possible security problem with malicious guests (CVE-2010-3851).

       <b>-h</b>
       <b>--human-readable</b>
           Display file sizes in human-readable format.

           This option only has effect in <u>-lR</u> output mode.  See "RECURSIVE LONG LISTING" above.

       <b>--key</b> SELECTOR
           Specify a key for LUKS, to automatically open a LUKS device when using the inspection.

           <b>--key</b> NAME<b>:key:</b>KEY_STRING
           <b>--key</b> UUID<b>:key:</b>KEY_STRING
           <b>--key</b> <b>all:key:</b>KEY_STRING
               "NAME" is the libguestfs device name (eg. "/dev/sda1").  "UUID" is the device UUID.  "all"  means
               try the key against any encrypted device.

               Use the specified "KEY_STRING" as passphrase.

           <b>--key</b> NAME<b>:file:</b>FILENAME
           <b>--key</b> UUID<b>:file:</b>FILENAME
           <b>--key</b> <b>all:file:</b>FILENAME
               Read the passphrase from <u>FILENAME</u>.

           <b>--key</b> NAME<b>:clevis</b>
           <b>--key</b> UUID<b>:clevis</b>
           <b>--key</b> <b>all:clevis</b>
               Attempt  passphrase-less unlocking for the device with Clevis, over the network.  Please refer to
               "ENCRYPTED DISKS" in <b><a href="../man3/guestfs.3.html">guestfs</a></b>(3) for more information on network-bound disk encryption (NBDE).

               Note that if any such option is present on  the  command  line,  QEMU  user  networking  will  be
               automatically enabled for the libguestfs appliance.

       <b>--keys-from-stdin</b>
           Read  key  or  passphrase  parameters from stdin.  The default is to try to read passphrases from the
           user by opening <u>/dev/tty</u>.

           If there are multiple encrypted devices then you may need to supply multiple keys on stdin,  one  per
           line.

       <b>-m</b> dev[:mountpoint[:options[:fstype]]]
       <b>--mount</b> dev[:mountpoint[:options[:fstype]]]
           Mount the named partition or logical volume on the given mountpoint.

           If the mountpoint is omitted, it defaults to <u>/</u>.

           Specifying  any  mountpoint disables the inspection of the guest and the mount of its root and all of
           its mountpoints, so make sure to mount all the mountpoints needed to work with the filenames given as
           arguments.

           If you don’t know what filesystems a disk image contains, you can either run guestfish  without  this
           option,  then  list  the  partitions,  filesystems  and  LVs available (see "list-partitions", "list-
           filesystems" and "lvs" commands), or you can use the <b><a href="../man1/virt-filesystems.1.html">virt-filesystems</a></b>(1) program.

           The third (and rarely used) part of the mount parameter is the list of mount options  used  to  mount
           the  underlying filesystem.  If this is not given, then the mount options are either the empty string
           or "ro" (the latter if the <u>--ro</u> flag is used).  By specifying the mount options,  you  override  this
           default  choice.   Probably  the  only  time  you  would  use  this is to enable ACLs and/or extended
           attributes if the filesystem can support them:

            -m /dev/sda1:/:acl,user_xattr

           Using this flag is equivalent to using the "mount-options" command.

           The fourth part of the parameter is the filesystem driver to use, such as "ext3" or "ntfs".  This  is
           rarely  needed,  but  can  be  useful  if multiple drivers are valid for a filesystem (eg: "ext2" and
           "ext3"), or if libguestfs misidentifies a filesystem.

       <b>-l</b>
       <b>--long</b>
       <b>-R</b>
       <b>--recursive</b>
           Select the mode.  With neither of these options, "virt-ls" produces a simple, flat list of the  files
           in the named directory.  See "SIMPLE LISTING".

           "virt-ls -l" produces a "long listing", which shows more detail.  See "LONG LISTING".

           "virt-ls  -R"  produces  a  recursive  list of files starting at the named directory.  See "RECURSIVE
           LISTING".

           "virt-ls -lR" produces a recursive long listing which can be more easily parsed.  See "RECURSIVE LONG
           LISTING".

       <b>--times</b>
           Display time fields.

           This option only has effect in <u>-lR</u> output mode.  See "RECURSIVE LONG LISTING" above.

       <b>--time-days</b>
           Display time fields as days before now (negative if in the future).

           Note that 0 in output means "up to 1 day before now", or that the age of the file is  between  0  and
           86399 seconds.

           This option only has effect in <u>-lR</u> output mode.  See "RECURSIVE LONG LISTING" above.

       <b>--time-relative</b>
           Display time fields as seconds before now (negative if in the future).

           This option only has effect in <u>-lR</u> output mode.  See "RECURSIVE LONG LISTING" above.

       <b>--time-t</b>
           Display time fields as seconds since the Unix epoch.

           This option only has effect in <u>-lR</u> output mode.  See "RECURSIVE LONG LISTING" above.

       <b>--uids</b>
           Display UID and GID fields.

           This option only has effect in <u>-lR</u> output mode.  See "RECURSIVE LONG LISTING" above.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--verbose</b>
           Enable verbose messages for debugging.

       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
           Display version number and exit.

       <b>-x</b>  Enable tracing of libguestfs API calls.

</pre><h4><b>OLD-STYLE</b> <b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Previous versions of virt-ls allowed you to write either:

        virt-ls disk.img [disk.img ...] /dir

       or

        virt-ls guestname /dir

       whereas  in  this  version  you should use <u>-a</u> or <u>-d</u> respectively to avoid the confusing case where a disk
       image might have the same name as a guest.

       For compatibility the old style is still supported.

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b> <b>ABOUT</b> <b>CSV</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Comma-separated values (CSV) is a deceptive format.  It <u>seems</u> like it should be easy to parse, but it  is
       definitely not easy to parse.

       Myth: Just split fields at commas.  Reality: This does <u>not</u> work reliably.  This example has two columns:

        "foo,bar",baz

       Myth: Read the file one line at a time.  Reality: This does <u>not</u> work reliably.  This example has one row:

        "foo
        bar",baz

       For  shell  scripts,  use  "csvtool"  (https://github.com/Chris00/ocaml-csv  also packaged in major Linux
       distributions).

       For other languages, use a CSV processing library (eg. "Text::CSV" for  Perl  or  Python’s  built-in  csv
       library).

       Most spreadsheets and databases can import CSV directly.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       This program returns 0 if successful, or non-zero if there was an error.
