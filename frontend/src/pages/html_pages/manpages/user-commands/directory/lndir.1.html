       lndir - create a shadow directory of symbolic links to another directory tree

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lndir</b> [ <b>-silent</b> ] [ <b>-ignorelinks</b> ] [ <b>-withrevinfo</b> ] <u>fromdir</u> [ <u>todir</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>lndir</u>  program  makes a shadow copy <u>todir</u> of a directory tree <u>fromdir,</u> except that the shadow is not
       populated with real files but instead with symbolic links pointing at  the  real  files  in  the  <u>fromdir</u>
       directory  tree.  This is usually useful for maintaining source code for different machine architectures.
       You create a shadow directory containing links to the real source, which you will  have  usually  mounted
       from  a  remote  machine.   You  can build in the shadow tree, and the object files will be in the shadow
       directory, while the source files in the shadow directory are just symlinks to the real files.

       This scheme has the advantage that if you update the source, you need not propagate  the  change  to  the
       other  architectures  by hand, since all source in all shadow directories are symlinks to the real thing:
       just cd to the shadow directory and recompile away.

       The <u>todir</u> argument is optional and defaults to the  current  directory.   The  <u>fromdir</u>  argument  may  be
       relative (e.g., ../src) and is relative to <u>todir</u> (not the current directory).

       Note  that  BitKeeper,  CVS, CVS.adm, .git, .hg, RCS, SCCS, and .svn directories are shadowed only if the
       <b>-withrevinfo</b> flag is specified.  Files with names ending in <u>~</u> are never shadowed.

       If you add files, simply run <u>lndir</u> again.  New files will be silently added.  Old files will  be  checked
       that they have the correct link.

       Deleting files is a more painful problem; the symlinks will just point into never never land.

       If a file in <u>fromdir</u> is a symbolic link, <u>lndir</u> will make the same link in <u>todir</u> rather than making a link
       back to the (symbolic link) entry in <u>fromdir.</u>  The <b>-ignorelinks</b> flag changes this behavior.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -silent
              Normally  <u>lndir</u>  outputs the name of each subdirectory as it descends into it.  The <b>-silent</b> option
              suppresses these status messages.

       -ignorelinks
              Causes the program to not treat symbolic links in <u>fromdir</u> specially.  The link  created  in  <u>todir</u>
              will  point  back  to  the  corresponding  (symbolic  link)  file in <u>fromdir</u>.  If the link is to a
              directory, this is almost certainly the wrong thing.

              This option exists mostly to emulate the behavior the C version of <u>lndir</u> had in X11R6.  Its use is
              not recommended.

       -withrevinfo
              Causes any source control manager subdirectories (those named BitKeeper, CVS, CVS.adm, .git,  .hg,
              RCS, SCCS, or .svn) to be treated as any other directory, rather than ignored.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       The  program  displays  the name of each subdirectory it enters, followed by a colon.  The <b>-silent</b> option
       suppresses these messages.

       A warning message is displayed if the symbolic link cannot be created.   The  usual  problem  is  that  a
       regular file of the same name already exists.

       If  the  link  already exists but doesn't point to the correct file, the program prints the link name and
       the location where it does point.
