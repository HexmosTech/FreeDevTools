</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dh_di_numbers - install numbered scripts into package build directories

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dh_di_numbers</b> [<b>debhelper</b> <b>options</b>] [<u>dir</u> <u>[...]</u> <u>dest</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       dh_di_numbers is a debhelper program that installs directories of numbered scripts into package build
       directories.

       Within each directory, there should be a "_numbers" file in which each line contains at least two space-
       separated fields. The first field in each line is a two-digit number, which will be prefixed to the entry
       name to provide ordering within the directory; the second is the entry name, which must correspond to a
       file or directory alongside the "_numbers" file; and the third field, if present, is another two-digit
       number which identifies another entry with the same entry name to which this entry should be a symlink.

       Any additional directory names specified as parameters will be installed in the package build directory
       of the first package dh_di_numbers is told to act on. By default, this is the first binary package in
       debian/control, but if you use -p, -i, or -a flags, it will be the first package specified by those
       flags.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       debian/<u>package</u>.di-numbers
           List  the directories to install into each package and the directory they should be installed to. The
           format is a set of lines, where each line lists a directory or directories to install, and at the end
           of the line tells the directory they should be installed in. The name of the directories  to  install
           should be given relative to the current directory, while the installation directory is given relative
           to  the  package  build  directory. You may use wildcards in the names of the files to install (in v3
           mode and above).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>dir</u> <u>[...]</u> <u>dest</u>
           Lists directories to install and where to install them to. The files will be installed into the first
           package dh_di_numbers acts on.
