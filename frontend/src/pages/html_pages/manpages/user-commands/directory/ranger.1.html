</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       ranger is a console file manager with VI key bindings.

</pre><h4><b>RESOURCES</b></h4><pre>
       This <u>manual</u> contains instructions on how to use and configure ranger.

       Inside <u>ranger</u>, you can press <u>?</u> for a list of key bindings, commands or settings.

       The file <u>README.md</u> contains install instructions.

       The file <u>HACKING.md</u> contains guidelines for code modification.

       The directory <u>doc/configs</u> contains configuration files.  They are usually installed to <u>/etc/ranger/config</u>
       and can be obtained with ranger's --copy-config option.

       The directory <u>examples</u> contains reference implementations for ranger plugins, sample configuration files
       and some programs for integrating ranger with other software.  They are usually installed to
       <u>/usr/share/doc/ranger/examples</u>.

       The man page of <b><a href="../man1/rifle.1.html">rifle</a></b>(1) describes the functions of the file opener

       The section <u>LINKS</u> of this man page contains further resources.

</pre><h4><b>POSITIONAL</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>path</u> <u>...</u>      Each  path will be opened in a tab and if the path is a file it will be selected.  Omitting
                     this is equivalent to providing the current directory.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b>, <b>--debug</b>   Activate the debug mode: Whenever an error occurs,  ranger  will  exit  and  print  a  full
                     traceback.   The  default  behavior  is  to  merely  print the name of the exception in the
                     statusbar/log and try to keep running.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--clean</b>   Activate the clean mode:  ranger will not access or create any configuration files nor will
                     it leave any traces on your system.  This is useful when your configuration is broken, when
                     you want to avoid clutter, etc.

       <b>--cachedir</b>=<u>dir</u>
                     Change the cache directory of ranger from $XDG_CACHE_HOME or <a href="file:~/.cache/ranger">~/.cache/ranger</a> to "dir".

       <b>-r</b> <u>dir</u>, <b>--confdir</b>=<u>dir</u>
                     Change the configuration directory of ranger from $XDG_CONFIG_HOME or  <a href="file:~/.config/ranger">~/.config/ranger</a>  to
                     "dir".

       <b>--datadir</b>=<u>dir</u> Change the data directory of ranger from $XDG_DATA_HOME or <a href="file:~/.local/share/ranger">~/.local/share/ranger</a> to "dir".

       <b>--copy-config</b>=<u>file</u>
                     Create  copies  of  the  default configuration files in your local configuration directory.
                     Existing ones will not be overwritten.  Possible values: <u>all</u>, <u>commands</u>, <u>commands_full</u>,  <u>rc</u>,
                     <u>rifle</u>, <u>scope</u>.

                     Note:  You  may  want  to  disable  loading  of the global configuration files by exporting
                     <u>RANGER_LOAD_DEFAULT_RC=FALSE</u> in your environment.  See also: <b>FILES</b>, <b>ENVIRONMENT</b>

                     --copy-config=<b>commands</b> will copy only a small sample configuration file with  a  thoroughly
                     commented  example.   It  is  recommended  to  keep this file tidy to avoid getting defunct
                     commands  on  ranger  upgrades.   The  full  default  commands.py  can   be   copied   with
                     --copy-config=<b>commands_full</b>,  but  that file will be ignored by ranger and serves only as a
                     reference for making your own commands.

       <b>--choosefile</b>=<u>targetfile</u>
                     Allows you to pick a file with ranger.  This changes the behavior so that when you  open  a
                     file, ranger will exit and write the absolute path of that file into <u>targetfile</u>.

       <b>--choosefiles</b>=<u>targetfile</u>
                     Allows  you to pick multiple files with ranger.  This changes the behavior so that when you
                     open a file, ranger will exit and write the absolute  paths  of  all  selected  files  into
                     <u>targetfile</u>, adding one newline after each filename.

       <b>--choosedir</b>=<u>targetfile</u>
                     Allows  you  to pick a directory with ranger.  When you exit ranger, it will write the last
                     visited directory into <u>targetfile</u>.

       <b>--selectfile</b>=<u>targetfile</u>
                     Open ranger with <u>targetfile</u> selected. This is a legacy option, superseded by  the  behavior
                     for the POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS.

       <b>--show-only-dirs</b>
                     Display only the directories. May be used in conjunction with <b>--choosedir</b>=<u>targetfile</u>.

       <b>--list-unused-keys</b>
                     List  common keys which are not bound to any action in the "browser" context.  This list is
                     not complete, you can bind any key that is supported by curses: use the key  code  returned
                     by "getch()".

       <b>--list-tagged-files</b>=<u>tag</u>
                     List all files which are tagged with the given tag.  Note: Tags are single characters.  The
                     default tag is "*"

       <b>--profile</b>     Print statistics of CPU usage on exit.

       <b>--cmd</b>=<u>command</u> Execute  the command after the configuration has been read.  Use this option multiple times
                     to run multiple commands.

       <b>--version</b>     Print the version and exit.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>    Print a list of options and exit.

</pre><h4><b>CONCEPTS</b></h4><pre>
       This part explains how certain parts of ranger work and how they can be used efficiently.

   <b>TAGS</b>
       Tags are single characters which are displayed left of a filename.  You can use tags  however  you  want.
       Press  "t"  to  toggle  tags and "ut" to remove any tags of the selection. The default tag is an Asterisk
       ("*"), but you can use any tag by typing <u>"&lt;tagname&gt;</u>.

   <b>PREVIEWS</b>
       By default, only text files are previewed, but you can enable external preview  scripts  by  setting  the
       option "use_preview_script" and "preview_files" to true.

       This  default  script  is  <u>%rangerdir/data/scope.sh</u>.  It  contains  more  documentation and calls to many
       external programs to generate previews.  They  are  automatically  used  when  available  but  completely
       optional.

       For general usage:
         - "file" for determining file types

         - "chardet" (Python package) for improved encoding detection of text files

         - "sudo" to use the "run as root" feature

         - "python-bidi" (Python package) to display right-to-left file names correctly (Hebrew, Arabic)

       For enhanced file previews (with scope.sh):
         - "img2txt" (from "caca-utils") for ASCII-art image previews

         - "w3mimgdisplay", "ueberzug", "mpv", "iTerm2", "kitty", "terminology" or "urxvt" for image previews

         - "convert" (from "imagemagick") to auto-rotate images and for SVG previews

         - "ffmpegthumbnailer" for video thumbnails

         - "highlight", "bat" or "pygmentize" for syntax highlighting of code

         - "atool", "bsdtar", "unrar" and/or "7z" to preview archives

         - "bsdtar",  "tar",  "unrar",  "unzip"  and/or "zipinfo" (and "sed") to preview archives as their first
           image

         - "lynx", "w3m" or "elinks" to preview html pages

         - "pdftotext" or "mutool" (and "fmt") for textual pdf previews, "pdftoppm" to preview as image

         - "djvutxt" for textual DjVu previews, "ddjvu" to preview as image

         - "calibre" or "epub-thumbnailer" for image previews of ebooks

         - "transmission-show" for viewing BitTorrent information

         - "mediainfo" or "exiftool" for viewing information about media files

         - "odt2txt" for OpenDocument text files (odt, ods, odp and sxw)

         - "python" or "jq" for JSON files

         - "fontimage" for font previews

       Install these programs (just the ones you need) and scope.sh will automatically use them.

       Independently of the preview script, there is a feature to preview images by drawing them  directly  into
       the terminal. To enable this feature, set the option "preview_images" to true and enable one of the image
       preview modes:

       <u>iTerm2</u>

       This only works in iTerm2 compiled with image preview support, but works over ssh.

       To enable this feature, set the option "preview_images_method" to iterm2.

       This  feature relies on the dimensions of the terminal's font.  By default, a width of 8 and height of 11
       are used.  To use other values, set the  options  "iterm2_font_width"  and  "iterm2_font_height"  to  the
       desired values.

       <u>kitty</u>

       This only works in Kitty. It requires PIL (or pillow) to work.  Allows remote image previews, for example
       in an ssh session.

       To enable this feature, set the option "preview_images_method" to kitty.

       <u>terminology</u>

       This only works in terminology. It can render vector graphics, but works only locally.

       To enable this feature, set the option "preview_images_method" to terminology.

       <u>ueberzug</u>

       Ueberzug  is  a command line utility which draws images on terminals using child windows. It requires PIL
       (or pillow) and relies on X11. This makes it compatible (in a limited way,  i.e.,  tmux  splits  are  not
       supported) with many terminals and tmux but not the Linux console or Wayland.

       To enable this feature, set the option "preview_images_method" to ueberzug.

       <u>urxvt</u>

       This only works in urxvt compiled with pixbuf support. Does not work over ssh.

       Essentially this mode sets an image as a terminal background temporarily, so it will break any previously
       set image background.

       To enable this feature, set the option "preview_images_method" to urxvt.

       <u>urxvt-full</u>

       The same as urxvt but utilizing not only the preview pane but the whole terminal window.

       To enable this feature, set the option "preview_images_method" to urxvt-full.

       <u>w3m</u>

       This  does  not  work  over  ssh,  requires  certain  terminals  (tested  on  "xterm" and "urxvt") and is
       incompatible with tmux, although it works with screen.

       To enable this feature, install the program "w3m" and set the option "preview_images_method" to w3m.

       When using a terminal with a nonzero border which is not automatically detected, the w3m preview will  be
       misaligned.   Use  the  "w3m_offset"  option to manually adjust the image offset. This should be the same
       value as the terminal's border value.

   <b>SELECTION</b>
       The <u>selection</u> is defined as "All marked files IF THERE ARE ANY, otherwise the current file."  Be aware of
       this when using the :delete command, which deletes all files in the selection.

       You can mark files by pressing &lt;Space&gt;, v, etc.  A yellow <b>Mrk</b> symbol at the bottom right  indicates  that
       there are marked files in this directory.

   <b>MACROS</b>
       Macros can be used in commands to abbreviate things.

        %f   the highlighted file
        %d   the path of the current directory
        %s   the selected files in the current directory
        %t   all tagged files in the current directory
        %c   the full paths of the currently copied/cut files
        %p   the full paths of selected files

       The  macros %f, %d, %p, and %s also have upper case variants, %F, %D, %P, and %S, which refer to the next
       tab.  To refer to specific tabs, add a number in between.  (%7s = selection of the seventh tab.)

       %c is the only macro which ranges out of the current directory. So you may "abuse" the  copying  function
       for other purposes, like diffing two files which are in different directories:

        Yank the file A (type yy), move to the file B, then type
        @diff %c %f

       Macros for file paths are generally shell-escaped so they can be used in the "shell" command.

       When mapping keys you can use the placeholder &lt;any&gt;, the key entered in that position can be used through
       the  %any  and %any_path macros. (When using multiple &lt;any&gt; placeholders you can index the macros: %any0,
       %any_path0, %any1, %any_path1...) The macro %any will be replaced with the key pressed in the position of
       the &lt;any&gt; placeholder. The macro %any_path will be replaced with the path of the bookmark mapped  to  the
       key  pressed in the position of the &lt;any&gt; placeholder. For example this macro can be used to echo the key
       that was pressed after "c":

        map c&lt;any&gt; echo %any

       %any is used in the ranger configuration to create a keybinding for adding  a  bookmark.  c&lt;set_bookmark&gt;
       creates a bookmark for the current directory and the key for the bookmark is the first supplied argument.
       In this case the key pressed after "m":

        map m&lt;any&gt; set_bookmark %any

       The  %any_path  macro  can  be used to echo the path of the bookmark that is set to the key pressed after
       "c":

        map c&lt;any&gt; echo %any_path

       A practical example of the use of %any_path is the pasting of cut/copied files to a bookmarked directory:

        map p'&lt;any&gt; paste dest=%any_path

       The macro %rangerdir expands to the directory of ranger's python library, you can use  it  for  something
       like this command:
        alias show_commands shell less %rangerdir/config/commands.py

       %confdir expands to the directory given by <b>--confdir</b>.

       %datadir expands to the directory given by <b>--datadir</b>.

       The  macro %space expands to a space character. You can use it to add spaces to the end of a command when
       needed, while preventing editors to strip spaces off the end of the line automatically.

       To write a literal %, you need to escape it by writing %%.

       Note that macros are expanded twice when using chain. For example, to  insert  a  space  character  in  a
       chained command, you would write %%space:
        chain command1; command2%%space

   <b>BOOKMARKS</b>
       Type  <b>m&lt;key&gt;</b>  to  bookmark the current directory. You can re-enter this directory by typing <b>`&lt;key&gt;</b>. &lt;key&gt;
       can be any letter or digit.  Unlike vim, both lowercase and uppercase bookmarks are persistent.

       Each time you jump to a bookmark, the special bookmark at key ` will be set to  the  last  directory.  So
       typing "``" gets you back to where you were before.

       Bookmarks are selectable when tabbing in the :cd command.

       Note: The bookmarks ' (Apostrophe) and ` (Backtick) are the same.

   <b>RIFLE</b>
       Rifle  is  the  file opener of ranger.  It can be used as a standalone program or a python module.  It is
       located at <u>$repo/ranger/ext/rifle.py</u>.  In  contrast  to  other,  more  simple  file  openers,  rifle  can
       automatically  find  installed  programs  so  it  can  be used effectively out of the box on a variety of
       systems.

       It's configured in <u>rifle.conf</u> through a list of conditions and commands.  For each  line  the  conditions
       are  checked and if they are met, the respective command is taken into consideration.  By default, simply
       the first matching rule is used.  In ranger, you can list and choose rules by typing  "r"  or  simply  by
       typing  "&lt;rulenumber&gt;&lt;enter&gt;".   If you use rifle standalone, you can list all rules with the "-l" option
       and pick a rule with "-p &lt;number&gt;".

       The rules, along with further documentation, are contained in <u>$repo/ranger/config/rifle.conf</u>.

   <b>FLAGS</b>
       Flags give you a way to modify the behavior of the spawned  process.   They  are  used  in  the  commands
       ":open_with" (key "r") and ":shell" (key "!").

        f   Fork the process, i.e. run in background. Please use this flag
            instead of calling "disown" or "nohup", to avoid killing the
            background command when pressing Ctrl+C in ranger.
        c   Run the current file only, instead of the selection
        r   Run application with root privilege (requires sudo)
        t   Run application in a new terminal window

       There  are  some  additional  flags  that can currently be used only in the "shell" command: (for example
       ":shell -w df")

        p   Redirect output to the pager
        s   Silent mode.  Output will be discarded.
        w   Wait for an Enter-press when the process is done

       By default, all the flags are off unless otherwise specified in <u>rc.conf</u> key bindings or <u>rifle.conf</u> rules.
       You can specify as many flags as you want. An uppercase flag negates the effect: "ffcccFsf" is equivalent
       to "cs".

       The terminal program name for the "t" flag is taken  from  the  environment  variable  $TERMCMD.   If  it
       doesn't  exist,  it  tries  to  extract it from $TERM, uses "x-terminal-emulator" as a fallback, and then
       "xterm" if that fails.

       Examples: ":open_with c" will open the file that you currently point at, even if you have selected  other
       files.  ":shell -w df" will run "df" and wait for you to press Enter before switching back to ranger.

   <b>PLUGINS</b>
       ranger's  plugin  system  consists of python files which are located in <u><a href="file:~/.config/ranger/plugins/">~/.config/ranger/plugins/</a></u> and are
       imported in alphabetical order when starting ranger.  A plugin changes rangers behavior by overwriting or
       extending a function that ranger uses.  This allows you to change pretty much every part of  ranger,  but
       there is no guarantee that things will continue to work in future versions as the source code evolves.

       Adding new commands via a plugin as simple as specifying them like you would do in the <u>commands.py</u>.

       There  are  some  hooks that are specifically made for the use in plugins.  They are functions that start
       with hook_ and can be found throughout the code.

        grep 'def hook_' -r /path/to/rangers/source

       Also try:

        pydoc ranger.api

       Note that you should NOT simply overwrite a function unless you know what you're  doing.   Instead,  save
       the  existing  function and call it from your new one.  This way, multiple plugins can use the same hook.
       There are several sample plugins in the <u>/usr/share/doc/ranger/examples/</u>  directory,  including  a  hello-
       world plugin that describes this procedure.

</pre><h4><b>KEY</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Key  bindings  are  defined in the file <u>%rangerdir/config/rc.conf</u>.  Check this file for a list of all key
       bindings.  You can copy it to your local configuration directory with the --copy-config=rc option.

       Many key bindings take an additional numeric argument.  Type <u>5j</u> to move down 5 lines, <u>2l</u> to open  a  file
       in mode 2, <u>10&lt;Space&gt;</u> to mark 10 files.

       This list contains the most useful bindings:

   <b>MAIN</b> <b>BINDINGS</b>
       h, j, k, l    Move left, down, up or right

       ^D or J, ^U or K
                     Move a half page down, up

       H, L          Move back and forward in the history

       gg            Move to the top

       G             Move to the bottom

       [, ]          Move up and down in the parent directory.

       ^R            Reload everything

       F             Toggle <u>freeze_files</u> setting.  When active (indicated by a cyan <u>FROZEN</u> message in the status
                     bar),  directories  and  files will not be loaded, improving performance when all the files
                     you need are already loaded.  This does not affect file previews, which can be toggled with
                     <u>zI</u>.  Also try disabling the preview of directories with <u>zP</u>.

       ^L            Redraw the screen

       i             Inspect the current file in a bigger window.

       E             Edit the current file in $VISUAL otherwise $EDITOR otherwise "vim"

       S             Open a shell in the current directory

       ?             Opens this man page

       W             Opens the log window where you can review messages that pop up at the bottom.

       w             Opens the task window where you can view and modify background processes that currently run
                     in ranger.  In there, you can type "dd" to abort a process and "J" or  "K"  to  change  the
                     priority of a process.  Only one process is run at a time.

       ^C            Stop  the currently running background process that ranger has started, like copying files,
                     loading directories or file previews.

       &lt;octal&gt;=, +&lt;who&gt;&lt;what&gt;, -&lt;who&gt;&lt;what&gt;
                     Change the permissions of the selection.  For example, "777=" is equivalent to  "chmod  777
                     %s", "+ar" does "chmod a+r %s", "-ow" does "chmod o-w %s" etc.

       yy            Copy (yank) the selection, like pressing Ctrl+C in modern GUI programs.  (You can also type
                     "ya" to add files to the copy buffer, "yr" to remove files again, or "yt" for toggling.)

       dd            Cut the selection, like pressing Ctrl+X in modern GUI programs.  (There are also "da", "dr"
                     and "dt" shortcuts equivalent to "ya", "yr" and "yt".)

       pp            Paste  the  files  which  were previously copied or cut, like pressing Ctrl+V in modern GUI
                     programs.

                     Conflicts will be renamed by appending an '_' (and a counter if  necessary),  resulting  in
                     "file.ext_",  "file.ext_0",  etc.  If  you  prefer  "file_.ext" you can use the "paste_ext"
                     command.

       po            Paste the copied/cut files, overwriting existing files.

       pP, pO        Like pp and po, but queues the operation so that  it  will  be  executed  <u>after</u>  any  other
                     operations.  Reminder: type "w" to open the task window.

       pl, pL        Create symlinks (absolute or relative) to the copied files

       phl           Create hardlinks to the copied files

       pht           Duplicate  the  subdirectory  tree  of the copied directory, then create hardlinks for each
                     contained file into the new directory tree.

       m<u>X</u>            Create a bookmark with the name <u>X</u>

       `<u>X</u>            Move to the bookmark with the name <u>X</u>

       n             Find the next file.  By default, this gets you to the newest file in the directory, but  if
                     you  search  something  using  the  keys  /, cm, ct, ..., it will get you to the next found
                     entry.

       N             Find the previous file.

       o<u>X</u>            Change the sort method (like in mutt)

       z<u>X</u>            Change settings.  See the settings section for a list of settings and their hotkey.

       u<u>?</u>            Universal undo-key.  Depending on the key that you press  after  "u",  it  either  restores
                     closed  tabs  (uq), removes tags (ut), clears the copy/cut buffer (ud), starts the reversed
                     visual mode (uV) or clears the selection (uv).

       f             Quickly navigate by entering a part of the filename.

       Space         Mark a file.

       v             Toggle the mark-status of all files

       V             Starts the visual mode, which selects all files between the starting point and  the  cursor
                     until you press ESC.  To unselect files in the same way, use "uV".

       /             Search for files in the current directory.

       :             Open the console.

       !             Open the console with the content "shell " so you can quickly run commands

       @             Open  the  console with the content "shell  %s", placing the cursor before the " %s" so you
                     can quickly run commands with the current selection as the argument.

       r             Open the console with the content "open with " so you can decide which program  to  use  to
                     open the current file selection.

       cd            Open the console with the content "cd "

       ^P            Open the console with the most recent command.

       Alt-<u>N</u>         Open  a  tab.  N  has  to be a number from 0 to 9. If the tab doesn't exist yet, it will be
                     created.

       Alt-l, Alt-r  Shift a tab left, respectively right.

       gn, ^N        Create a new tab.

       gt, gT        Go to the next or previous tab. You can also use TAB and SHIFT+TAB instead.

       gc, ^W        Close the current tab.  The last tab cannot be closed this way.

       M             A key chain that allows you to quickly change the line mode of all the files of the current
                     directory.  For a more permanent solution,  use  the  command  "default_linemode"  in  your
                     rc.conf.

       .d            Apply the typefilter "directory".

       .f            Apply the typefilter "file".

       .l            Apply the typefilter "symlink".

       .m            Apply a new mimetype filter.

       .n            Apply a new filename filter.

       .#            Apply a new hash filter.

       ."            Apply a new duplicate filter.

       .'            Apply a new unique filter.

       .|            Combine  the two topmost filters from the filter stack in the "OR" relationship, instead of
                     the "AND" used implicitly.

       .&amp;            Explicitly combine the two topmost filters in the "AND" relationship.  Usually  not  needed
                     because  filters  are  implicitly  in  this  relationship  though  might  be useful in more
                     complicated scenarios.

       .!            Negate the topmost filter.

       .r            Rotate the filter stack by N elements. Where N is provided as a numeric prefix  like  vim's
                     <u>count</u> and defaults to 1, i.e. move the topmost element to the bottom of the stack.

       .c            Clear the filter stack.

       .*            Decompose the topmost filter combinator (e.g. ".!", ".|").

       .p            Pop the topmost filter from the filter stack.

       ..            Show the current filter stack state.

</pre><h4><b>MOUSE</b> <b>BUTTONS</b></h4><pre>
       Left Mouse Button
           Click  on  something and you'll move there.  To run a file, "enter" it, like a directory, by clicking
           on the preview.

       Right Mouse Button
           Enter a directory or run a file.

       Scroll Wheel
           Scrolls up or down.  You can point at the column of the parent directory while  scrolling  to  switch
           directories.

</pre><h4><b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       This  section  lists  all  built-in settings of ranger.  The valid types for the value are in [brackets].
       The hotkey to toggle the setting is in &lt;brakets&gt;, if a hotkey exists.

       Settings can be changed in the file <u><a href="file:~/.config/ranger/rc.conf">~/.config/ranger/rc.conf</a></u> or on the fly with the command  <b>:set</b>  <b>option</b>
       <b>value</b>.  Examples:

        set column_ratios 1,2,3
        set show_hidden true

       Toggling options can be done with:

        set show_hidden!

       The different types of settings and an example for each type:

        setting type   | example values
        ---------------+----------------------------
        bool           | true, false
        integer        | 1, 23, 1337
        string         | foo, hello world
        list           | 1,2,3,4
        none           | none

       You can view a list of all settings and their current values by pressing "3?"  in ranger.

       automatically_count_files [bool]
           Should  ranger count and display the number of files in each directory as soon as it's visible?  This
           gets slow with remote file systems.  Turning it off will still allow you to see the number  of  files
           after entering the directory.

       autosave_bookmarks [bool]
           Save bookmarks (used with mX and `X) instantly?  This helps to synchronize bookmarks between multiple
           ranger instances but leads to *slight* performance loss.  When false, bookmarks are saved when ranger
           is exited.

       autoupdate_cumulative_size [bool]
           You  can  display the "real" cumulative size of directories by using the command :get_cumulative_size
           or typing "dc".  The size is expensive to calculate and will not be updated automatically.   You  can
           choose to update it automatically though by turning on this option.

       cd_bookmarks [bool]
           Specify whether bookmarks should be included in the tab completion of the "cd" command.

       cd_tab_case [string]
           Changes case sensitivity for the "cd" command tab completion. Possible values are:

            sensitive
            insensitive
            smart

       cd_tab_fuzzy [bool]
           Use  fuzzy  tab  completion  with  the  "cd"  command.  For  example, <b>:cd</b> <b>/u/lo/b&lt;TAB&gt;</b> expands to <b>:cd</b>
           <b><a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a></b>.

       clear_filters_on_dir_change [bool]
           If set to 'true', persistent filters would be cleared upon leaving the directory

       collapse_preview [bool] &lt;zc&gt;
           When no preview is visible, should the last column be squeezed to make use of the whitespace?

       colorscheme [string]
           Which colorscheme to use?  These colorschemes are available by default: <b>default</b>, <b>jungle</b>, <b>snow</b>.   Snow
           is  a  monochrome  scheme,  jungle replaces blue directories with green ones for better visibility on
           certain terminals.

       column_ratios [list]
           How many columns are there, and what are their relative widths?  For example, a value of 1,1,1  would
           mean  3 evenly sized columns. 1,1,1,1,4 means 5 columns with the preview column being as large as the
           other columns combined.

       confirm_on_delete [string]
           Ask for a confirmation when running the "delete"  command?   Valid  values  are  "always"  (default),
           "never", "multiple". With "multiple", ranger will ask only if you delete multiple files at once.

       dirname_in_tabs [bool]
           Display the directory name in tabs?

       display_size_in_main_column [bool]
           Display the file size in the main column?

       display_size_in_status_bar [bool]
           Display the file size in the status bar?

       display_free_space_in_status_bar [bool]
           Display the free disk space in the status bar?

       display_tags_in_all_columns [bool]
           Display tags in all columns?

       draw_borders [string]
           Draw borders around or between the columns? Possible values are:

            none           no borders of any sort
            outline        draw an outline around all the columns
            separators     draw only vertical lines between columns
            both           both of the above

       draw_progress_bar_in_status_bar [bool]
           Draw a progress bar in the status bar which displays the average state of all currently running tasks
           which support progress bars?

       flushinput [bool] &lt;zi&gt;
           Flush the input after each key hit?  One advantage is that when scrolling down with "j", ranger stops
           scrolling  instantly  when  you  release  the  key.   One disadvantage is that when you type commands
           blindly, some keys might get lost.

       freeze_files [bool] &lt;F&gt;
           When active, directories and files will not be loaded, improving performance when all the  files  you
           need are already loaded.  This does not affect file previews.

       global_inode_type_filter [string]
           Like filter_inode_type, but globally for all directories.  Useful in combination with <b>--choosedir</b>:

            ranger --choosedir=/tmp/x --cmd='set global_inode_type_filter d'

       hidden_filter [string]
           A  regular  expression pattern for files which should be hidden.  For example, this pattern will hide
           all files that start with a dot or end with a tilde.

            set hidden_filter ^\.|~$

       hint_collapse_threshold [int]
           The key hint lists up to this size have their sublists expanded.  Otherwise the submaps are  replaced
           with "...".

       hostname_in_titlebar [bool]
           Show hostname in titlebar?

       size_in_bytes [bool]
           Print file sizes in bytes instead of the default human-readable format.

       idle_delay [integer]
           The  delay that ranger idly waits for user input, in milliseconds, with a resolution of 100ms.  Lower
           delay reduces lag between directory updates but increases CPU load.

       iterm2_font_height [integer]
           Change the assumed font height in iTerm2, which may help with iTerm image previews

       iterm2_font_width [integer]
           Change the assumed font width in iTerm2, which may help with iTerm image previews

       line_numbers [string]
           Show line numbers in main column.  Possible values are:

            false      turn the feature off
            absolute   absolute line numbers for use with "&lt;N&gt;gg"
            relative   relative line numbers for "&lt;N&gt;k" or "&lt;N&gt;j"

       max_console_history_size [integer, none]
           How many console commands should be kept in history?  "none" will disable the limit.

       max_history_size [integer, none]
           How many directory changes should be kept in history?

       metadata_deep_search [bool]
           When the metadata manager module looks for metadata, should it only look for a ".metadata.json"  file
           in  the  current  directory,  or  do a deep search and check all directories above the current one as
           well?

       mouse_enabled [bool] &lt;zm&gt;
           Enable mouse input?

       nested_ranger_warning [string]
           Warn at startup if "RANGER_LEVEL" is greater than 0, in other words give  a  warning  when  you  nest
           ranger  in  a subshell started by ranger. Allowed values are "true", "false" and "error". The special
           value "error" promotes the warning to an error, this is usually shown as  red  text  but  will  crash
           ranger when run with the "--debug" flag.

       one_indexed [bool]
           Start line numbers from 1.  Possible values are:

            false      start line numbers from 0
            true       start line numbers from 1

       open_all_images [bool]
           Open all images in this directory when running certain image viewers like feh or sxiv?  You can still
           open selected files by marking them.

           If  there  would be too many files for the system to handle, this option will be temporarily disabled
           automatically.

       padding_right [bool]
           When collapse_preview is on and there is no preview, should there remain  a  little  padding  on  the
           right?  This allows you to click into that space to run the file.

       preview_directories [bool] &lt;zP&gt;
           Preview directories in the preview column?

       preview_files [bool] &lt;zp&gt;
           Preview files in the preview column?

       preview_images [bool]
           Draw images inside the console with the external program w3mimgpreview?

       preview_images_method [string]
           Set  the  preview  image method. Supported methods: w3m, iterm2, urxvt, urxvt-full, terminology.  See
           <u>PREVIEWS</u> section.

       preview_max_size [int]
           Avoid previewing files that exceed a certain size, in bytes.  Use  a  value  of  0  to  disable  this
           feature.

       preview_script [string, none]
           Which  script should handle generating previews?  If the file doesn't exist, or use_preview_script is
           off, ranger will handle previews itself by just printing the content.

       relative_current_zero [bool]
           When line_numbers is set to relative, show 0 on the current line if true or show the absolute  number
           of the current line when false.

       save_backtick_bookmark [bool]
           Save the "`" bookmark to disk.  This bookmark is used to switch to the last directory by typing "``".

       save_console_history [bool]
           Should  the  console  history  be  saved on exit?  If disabled, the console history is reset when you
           restart ranger.

       save_tabs_on_exit [bool]
           Save all tabs, except the active, on exit? The last saved tabs are restored once  when  starting  the
           next session. Multiple sessions are stored in a stack and the oldest saved tabs are restored first.

       scroll_offset [integer]
           Try to keep this much space between the top/bottom border when scrolling.

       shorten_title [integer]
           Trim  the title of the window if it gets long?  The number defines how many directories are displayed
           at once. A value of 0 turns off this feature.

       show_cursor [bool]
           Always show the terminal cursor?

       show_hidden_bookmarks [bool]
           Show dotfiles in the bookmark preview window? (Type ')

       show_hidden [bool] &lt;zh&gt;, &lt;^H&gt;
           Show hidden files?

       show_selection_in_titlebar [bool]
           Add the highlighted file to the path in the titlebar

       sort_case_insensitive [bool] &lt;zc&gt;
           Sort case-insensitively?  If true, "a" will be listed before "B"  even  though  its  ASCII  value  is
           higher.

       sort_directories_first [bool] &lt;zd&gt;
           Sort directories first?

       sort_reverse [bool] &lt;or&gt;
           Reverse the order of files?

       sort_unicode [bool]
           When  sorting according to some string, should the unicode characters be compared, instead of looking
           at the raw character values to save time?

       sort [string] &lt;oa&gt;, &lt;ob&gt;, &lt;oc&gt;, &lt;oe&gt;, &lt;om&gt;, &lt;on&gt;, &lt;ot&gt;, &lt;os&gt;, &lt;oz&gt;
           Which sorting mechanism should be used?  Choose one of  <b>atime</b>,  <b>basename</b>,  <b>ctime</b>,  <b>extension</b>,  <b>mtime</b>,
           <b>natural</b>, <b>type</b>, <b>size</b>, <b>random</b>

           Note:  You  can  reverse  the order by typing an uppercase second letter in the key combination, e.g.
           "oN" to sort from Z to A.

       status_bar_on_top [bool]
           Put the status bar at the top of the window?

       bidi_support [bool]
           Try to properly display file names in RTL languages (Hebrew, Arabic) by using  a  BIDI  algorithm  to
           reverse the relevant parts of the text.  Requires the python-bidi pip package.

       update_title [bool]
           Set a window title? Updates both the <u>WM_NAME</u> and <u>WM_ICON_NAME</u> properties.

       update_tmux_title [bool]

       There  are additional commands which are directly translated to python functions, one for every method in
       the ranger.core.actions.Actions class.  They are not documented here,  since  they  are  mostly  for  key
       bindings, not to be typed in by a user.  Read the source if you are interested in them.

       These are the public commands including their descriptions:

       alias [<u>newcommand</u>] [<u>oldcommand</u>]
         Copies the oldcommand as newcommand.

       bulkrename
         This  command  opens a list of selected files in an external editor.  After you edit and save the file,
         it will generate a shell script which does bulk renaming according to the changes you did in the file.

         This shell script is opened in an editor for you to review.  After you close it, it will be executed.

       cd [<u>path</u>]
         The cd command changes the directory.  If path is a file, selects that file.  The command  ":cd  -"  is
         equivalent to typing ``.

       chain <u>command1</u>[; <u>command2</u>[; <u>command3</u>...]]
         Combines multiple commands into one, separated by semicolons.

       chmod <u>octal_number</u>
         Sets the permissions of the selection to the octal number.

         The octal number is between 000 and 777. The digits specify the permissions for the user, the group and
         others.  A 1 permits execution, a 2 permits writing, a 4 permits reading.  Add those numbers to combine
         them. So a 7 permits everything.

         Key  bindings  in the form of [-+]&lt;who&gt;&lt;what&gt; and &lt;octal&gt;= also exist.  For example, <b>+ar</b> allows reading
         for everyone, -ow forbids others to write and 777= allows everything.

         See also: man 1 chmod

       console [-p<u>N</u>] <u>command</u>
         Opens the console with the command already typed in.  The cursor is placed at <u>N</u>.

       copymap  <u>key</u> <u>newkey</u> [<u>newkey2</u> ...]
       copycmap <u>key</u> <u>newkey</u> [<u>newkey2</u> ...]
       copypmap <u>key</u> <u>newkey</u> [<u>newkey2</u> ...]
       copytmap <u>key</u> <u>newkey</u> [<u>newkey2</u> ...]
         Copies the keybinding <u>key</u> to <u>newkey</u> in the "browser" context.  This is a deep copy, so  if  you  change
         the  new  binding (or parts of it) later, the old one is not modified. For example, <u>copymap</u> <u>j</u> <u>down</u> will
         make the key sequence "down" move the cursor down one item.

         To copy key bindings of the console,  pager  or  taskview  use  "copycmap",  "copypmap"  or  "copytmap"
         respectively.

       default_linemode [<u>path=regexp</u> | <u>tag=tags</u>] <u>linemodename</u>
         Sets the default linemode.  See <u>linemode</u> command.

         Examples:

         Set the global default linemode to "permissions":
          :default_linemode permissions

         Set the default linemode to "permissions" for all files tagged with "p" or "P":
          :default_linemode tag=pP permissions

         Set the default linemode for all files in <a href="file:~/books/">~/books/</a> to "metatitle":
          :default_linemode path=<a href="file:/home/.">/home/.</a>*?/books/.* metatitle

       delete
         Destroy  all  files in the selection with a roundhouse kick.  ranger will ask for a confirmation if you
         attempt to delete multiple (marked) files or non-empty directories.  This can be changed  by  modifying
         the setting "confirm_on_delete".

       echo <u>text</u>
         Display the text in the statusbar.

       edit [<u>filename</u>]
         Edit the current file or the file in the argument.

       eval [<u>-q</u>] <u>python_code</u>
         Evaluates  the python code.  `fm' is a reference to the FM instance.  To display text, use the function
         `p'.  The result is displayed on the screen unless you use the "-q" option.

         Examples:
          :eval fm
          :eval len(fm.tabs)
          :eval p("Hello World!")

       filter [<u>string</u>]
         Displays only the files which contain the <u>string</u> in their basename.  Running this command  without  any
         parameter will reset the filter.

         This command is based on the <u>scout</u> command and supports all of its options.

       filter_inode_type [dfl]
         Displays only the files of specified inode type. To display only directories, use the 'd' parameter. To
         display only files, use the 'f' parameter. To display only links, use the 'l' parameter. Parameters can
         be combined. To remove this filter, use no parameter.

       filter_stack [<u>command</u> [<u>args</u>]]
         Manage the filter stack, adding, removing and manipulating filters. For example, to show only duplicate
         files and symlinks:

           :filter_stack add type f
           :filter_stack add duplicate
           :filter_stack add and
           :filter_stack add type l
           :filter_stack add or

         Or using the mapped keys:

           .f ." .&amp; .l .|

         Available subcommands:

         add FILTER_TYPE [ARGS...]
           Add  a  new  filter  to  the  top  of  the filter stack. Each filter on the stack is applied in turn,
           resulting in an implicit logical "AND" relation. The following "FILTER_TYPE"s are available:

           duplicate
             Filter files so only files that have duplicates in  the  same  directory  are  shown.  Useful  when
             cleaning up identical songs and memes that were saved using distinct file names.

           filename NAME
             Filter files that contain NAME in the filename, regular expression syntax is allowed.

           hash PATH
             Filter files so only files with the same hash as PATH are shown.

           mimetype TYPE
             Filter files of a certain MIME type, regular expression syntax is allowed.

           typefilter [d|f|l]
             Filter files of a certain type, "d" for directories, "f" for files and "l" for symlinks.

           unique
             Filter files so only unique files and the oldest file of every set of duplicates is shown.

           and
             Explicitly  combine  the two topmost filters in the "AND" relationship.  Usually not needed because
             filters are implicitly in this relationship though might be useful in more complicated scenarios.

           not
             Negate the topmost filter.

           or
             Combine the two topmost filters from the filter stack in the  "OR"  relationship,  instead  of  the
             "AND" used implicitly.

         pop
           Pop the topmost filter from the filter stack.

         decompose
           Decompose the topmost filter combinator (e.g. ".!", ".|").

         rotate [N=1]
           Rotate  the  filter  stack  by  N elements. Where N is passed as argument or as a numeric prefix like
           vim's <u>count</u>, default to 1, i.e. move the topmost element to the bottom of the stack.

         clear
           Clear the filter stack.

         show
           Show the current filter stack state.

       find <u>pattern</u>
         Search files in the current directory that contain the given (case-insensitive) string in their name as
         you type.  Once there is an unambiguous result, it will be run immediately.  (Or  entered,  if  it's  a
         directory.)

         This command is based on the <u>scout</u> command and supports all of its options.

       flat level
         Flattens  the  directory  view  up to the specified level. Level -1 means infinite level. Level 0 means
         standard view without flattened directory view. Level values -2 and less are invalid.

       grep <u>pattern</u>
         Looks for a string in all marked files or directories.

       help
         Provides a quick way to view ranger documentations.

       jump_non [-<u>flags</u>...]
         Jumps to first non-directory if highlighted file is a directory and vice versa.

         Flags:
          -r    Jump in reverse order
          -w    Wrap around if reaching end of filelist

       linemode <u>linemodename</u>
         Sets the linemode of all files in the current directory.  The linemode may be:

          "filename":
            display each line as "&lt;basename&gt;...&lt;size&gt;"
          "fileinfo":
            display each line as "&lt;basename&gt;...&lt;<a href="../man1/file.1.html">file</a>(1) output&gt;"
          "mtime":
            display each line as "&lt;basename&gt;...&lt;mtime&gt;" in ISO format
          "humanreadablemtime":
            display each line as "&lt;basename&gt;...&lt;mtime&gt;" in a human readable
            format, more precise the more recent.
          "sizemtime":
            display each line as "&lt;basename&gt;...&lt;size&gt; &lt;mtime&gt;" in ISO format
          "humanreadablesizemtime":
            display each line as "&lt;basename&gt;...&lt;size&gt; &lt;mtime&gt;" in a human
            readable format, more precise the more recent.
          "permissions":
            display each line as "&lt;permissions&gt; &lt;owner&gt; &lt;group&gt; &lt;basename&gt;"
          "metatitle":
            display metadata from .metadata.json files if available, fall back
            to the "filename" linemode if no metadata was found.
            See :meta command.

         The custom linemodes may be added by subclassing the <u>LinemodeBase</u> class.  See the  <u>ranger.core.linemode</u>
         module for some examples.

       load_copy_buffer
         Load  the  copy  buffer from <u><a href="file:~/.config/ranger/copy_buffer">~/.config/ranger/copy_buffer</a></u>.  This can be used to pass the list of copied
         files to another ranger instance.

       map  <u>key</u> <u>command</u>
       cmap <u>key</u> <u>command</u>
       pmap <u>key</u> <u>command</u>
       tmap <u>key</u> <u>command</u>
         Assign the key combination to the given command.  Whenever you type the key/keys, the command  will  be
         executed.  Additionally, if you use a quantifier when typing the key, like 5j, it will be passed to the
         command as the attribute "self.quantifier".

         The  keys you bind with this command are accessible in the file browser only, not in the console, pager
         or taskview.  To bind keys there, use the commands "cmap", "pmap" or "tmap".

       mark <u>pattern</u>
         Mark all files matching the regular expression pattern.

         This command is based on the <u>scout</u> command and supports all of its options.

       mark_tag [<u>tags</u>]
         Mark all tags that are tagged with either of the given tags.  When leaving out the  tag  argument,  all
         tagged files are marked.

       meta <u>key</u> <u>value</u>
         Set the metadata of the currently highlighted file.  Example:

          :meta title The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
          :meta year 1979

         This metadata can be displayed by, for example, using the "metatitle" line mode by typing Mt.

       mkdir <u>dirname</u>
         Creates a directory with the name <u>dirname</u>.

       open_with [<u>application</u>] [<u>flags</u>] [<u>mode</u>]
         Open  the  selected  files  with the given application, unless it is omitted, in which case the default
         application is used.  <u>flags</u> change the way the application is executed and are described in  their  own
         section  in  this man page.  The <u>mode</u> is a number that specifies which application to use.  The list of
         applications is generated by the external file opener "rifle" and can be displayed when pressing "r" in
         ranger.

         Note that if you specify an application, the mode is ignored.

       prompt_metadata [<u>keys</u> <u>...</u>]
         Prompt the user to input metadata with the "meta" command for multiple keys in a row.

       quit
         Closes the current tab, if there's only one tab. Otherwise quits if there are  no  tasks  in  progress.
         The  current  directory will be bookmarked as ' so you can re-enter it by typing `` or '' the next time
         you start ranger.

       quit!
         Like "quit", except will force quit even if tasks are in progress.

       quitall
         Like "quit", except will quit even if multiple tabs are open.

       quitall!
         Like "quitall", except will force quit even if tasks are in progress.

       relink <u>newpath</u>
         Change the link destination of the current symlink  file  to  &lt;newpath&gt;.  First  &lt;tab&gt;  will  load  the
         original link.

       rename <u>newname</u>
         Rename  the  current  file.  If a file with that name already exists, the renaming will fail.  Also try
         the key binding A for appending something to a file name.

       rename_append [-<u>flags</u>...]
         Opens the console with ":rename &lt;current file&gt;" with the cursor positioned before the file extension.

         Flags:
          -a    Position before all extensions
          -r    Remove everything before extensions

       save_copy_buffer
         Save the copy buffer to <u><a href="file:~/.config/ranger/copy_buffer">~/.config/ranger/copy_buffer</a></u>.  This can be used to  pass  the  list  of  copied
         files to another ranger instance.

       scout [-<u>flags</u>...] [--] <u>pattern</u>
         Swiss army knife command for searching, traveling and filtering files.

         Flags:
          -a    Automatically open a file on unambiguous match
          -e    Open the selected file when pressing enter
          -f    Filter files that match the current search pattern
          -g    Interpret pattern as a glob pattern
          -i    Ignore the letter case of the files
          -k    Keep the console open when changing a directory with the command
          -l    Letter skipping; e.g. allow "rdme" to match the file "readme"
          -m    Mark the matching files after pressing enter
          -M    Unmark the matching files after pressing enter
          -p    Permanent filter: hide non-matching files after pressing enter
          -r    Interpret pattern as a regular expression pattern
          -s    Smart case; like -i unless pattern contains upper case letters
          -t    Apply filter and search pattern as you type
          -v    Inverts the match

         Multiple  flags  can be combined.  For example, ":scout -gpt" would create a :filter-like command using
         globbing.

       search <u>pattern</u>
         Search files in the current directory that  match  the  given  (case  insensitive)  regular  expression
         pattern.

         This command is based on the <u>scout</u> command and supports all of its options.

       search_inc <u>pattern</u>
         Search  files  in  the  current  directory  that  match the given (case insensitive) regular expression
         pattern.  This command gets you to matching files as you type.

         This command is based on the <u>scout</u> command and supports all of its options.

       set <u>option</u> <u>value</u>
         Assigns a new value to an option.   Valid  options  are  listed  in  the  settings  section.   Use  tab
         completion  to  get  the current value of an option, though this doesn't work for functions and regular
         expressions. Valid values are:

          setting type   | example values
          ---------------+----------------------------
          bool           | true, false
          integer        | 1, 23, 1337
          string         | foo, hello world
          list           | 1,2,3,4
          none           | none

       setintag <u>tags</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u>
         Assigns a new value to an option, but locally for the directories  that  are  marked  with  <u>tag</u>.   This
         means, that this option only takes effect when visiting that directory.

         For  example,  to change the sorting order in your downloads directory, tag it with the <u>v</u> tag by typing
         <u>"v</u>, then use this command:

          setintag v sort ctime

       setlocal [path=<u>path</u>] <u>option</u> <u>value</u>
         Assigns a new value to an option, but locally for the directory given by <u>path</u>. This  means,  that  this
         option only takes effect when visiting that directory. If no path is given, uses the current directory.

         <u>path</u>  is  a regular expression.  This means that "path=<a href="file:~/dl">~/dl</a>" applies to all paths that start with <u><a href="file:~/dl">~/dl</a></u>,
         e.g. <u><a href="file:~/dl2">~/dl2</a></u> and <u><a href="file:~/dl/foo">~/dl/foo</a></u>. To avoid this, use "path=<a href="file:~/dl">~/dl</a>$".

         <u>path</u> can be quoted with either single or double quotes to prevent unwanted splitting.  <u>path='<a href="file:~/dl">~/dl</a></u>  <u>dl$'</u>
         or <u>path="<a href="file:~/dl">~/dl</a></u> <u>dl$"</u>

       shell [-<u>flags</u>] <u>command</u>
         Run a shell command.  <u>flags</u> are discussed in their own section.

       source <u>filename</u>
         Reads commands from a file and executes them in the ranger console.

         This can be used to re-evaluate the rc.conf file after changing it:

          map X chain shell vim -p %confdir/rc.conf %rangerdir/config/rc.conf; \
                            source %confdir/rc.conf

       scroll_preview <u>value</u>
         Scroll the file preview by <u>value</u> lines.

       terminal
         Spawns the <u>x-terminal-emulator</u> starting in the current directory.

       touch <u>filename</u>
         Creates an empty file with the name <u>filename</u>, unless it already exists.

       trash
         Move  all  files  in  the  selection  to the trash using rifle. Rifle tries to use a trash manager like
         <u>trash-cli</u> if available but will fall back to moving  files  to  either  <u>$XDG_DATA_HOME/ranger-trash</u>  or
         <u><a href="file:~/.ranger/ranger-trash">~/.ranger/ranger-trash</a></u>.  This  is  a less permanent version of <u>delete</u>, relying on the user to clear out
         the trash whenever it's convenient. While having the possibility of restoring trashed files until  this
         happens.  ranger  will  ask  for a confirmation if you attempt to trash multiple (marked) files or non-
         empty directories. This can be changed by modifying the setting "confirm_on_delete".

       travel <u>pattern</u>
         Filters the current directory for files containing the letters  in  the  string,  possibly  with  other
         letters in between.  The filter is applied as you type.  When only one directory is left, it is entered
         and  the  console is automatically reopened, allowing for fast travel.  To close the console, press ESC
         or execute a file.

         This command is based on the <u>scout</u> command and supports all of its options.

       unmap  [<u>keys</u> ...]
       cunmap [<u>keys</u> ...]
       punmap [<u>keys</u> ...]
       tunmap [<u>keys</u> ...]
         Removes the given key mappings in the "browser" context.  To unmap key bindings in the console,  pager,
         or taskview use "cunmap", "punmap" or "tunmap".

       unmark <u>pattern</u>
         Unmark all files matching a regular expression pattern.

         This command is based on the <u>scout</u> command and supports all of its options.

       unmark_tag [<u>tags</u>]
         Unmark  all tags that are tagged with either of the given tags.  When leaving out the tag argument, all
         tagged files are unmarked.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       ranger   reads   several   configuration   files   which   are   located   in   <u>$HOME/.config/ranger</u>   or
       <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ranger</u>  if  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is defined.  You can use the --copy-config option to obtain
       the default configuration files.  The files contain further documentation.

       <u>rc.conf</u>, <u>commands.py</u> and <u>colorschemes</u> do not need to be copied fully as they will only be adding  to  the
       default  configuration files except if explicitly overridden. This may lead to some confusing situations,
       for example when a key is being bound despite the corresponding line being removed from the  user's  copy
       of  the  configuration  file.  This  behavior  may  be  disabled  with an environment variable (see also:
       <b>ENVIRONMENT</b>). Note: All other configuration files only read from one source; i.e. default  OR  user,  not
       both.   <u>rc.conf</u>  and  <u>commands.py</u>  are  additionally  read from <u>/etc/ranger</u> if they exist for system-wide
       configuration,  user  configuration  overrides  system  configuration   which   overrides   the   default
       configuration.

       When starting ranger with the <b>--clean</b> option, it will not access or create any of these files.

   <b>CONFIGURATION</b>
       rc.conf   Contains  a  list  of commands which are executed on startup.  Mostly key bindings and settings
                 are defined here.

       commands.py
                 A python module that defines commands which can be used in ranger's console by typing ":" or in
                 the rc.conf file.  Note that you can define commands in the same manner within plugins.

       commands_full.py
                 This file is copied by  --copy-config=commands_full  and  serves  as  a  reference  for  custom
                 commands.  It is entirely ignored by ranger.

       rifle.conf
                 This is the configuration file for the built-in file launcher called "rifle".

       scope.sh  This  is  a  script  that  handles  file  previews.   When  the  options <u>use_preview_script</u> and
                 <u>preview_files</u> are set, the program specified in the option <u>preview_script</u> is run and its output
                 and/or exit code determines rangers reaction.

       colorschemes/
                 Colorschemes can be placed here.

       plugins/  Plugins can be placed here.

   <b>STORAGE</b>
       bookmarks This file contains a list of bookmarks.  The syntax is /^(.):(.*)$<a href="file:/.">/.</a> The first character is the
                 bookmark key and the rest after the colon is the path to the file.  In ranger, bookmarks can be
                 set by typing m&lt;key&gt;, accessed by typing '&lt;key&gt; and deleted by typing um&lt;key&gt;.

       copy_buffer
                 When running the command :save_copy_buffer, the paths of all currently copied files  are  saved
                 in  this  file.  You can later run :load_copy_buffer to copy the same files again, pass them to
                 another ranger instance or process them in a script.

       history   Contains a list of commands that have been previously typed in.

       tagged    Contains a list of tagged files. The syntax is /^(.:)?(.*)$/ where  the  first  letter  is  the
                 optional  name  of  the  tag and the rest after the optional colon is the path to the file.  In
                 ranger, tags can be set by pressing t and  removed  with  T.   To  assign  a  named  tag,  type
                 "&lt;tagname&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       These environment variables have an effect on ranger:

       RANGER_LEVEL
               ranger  sets  this  environment  variable to "1" or increments it if it already exists.  External
               programs can determine whether they were spawned from ranger by checking for this variable.

       RANGER_LOAD_DEFAULT_RC
               If this variable is set to FALSE, ranger will not load the default rc.conf.  This can  save  time
               if you copied the whole rc.conf to <u><a href="file:~/.config/ranger/">~/.config/ranger/</a></u> and don't need the default one at all.

       VISUAL  Defines the editor to be used for the "E" key.  Falls back to EDITOR if undefined or empty.

       EDITOR  Defines  the  editor  to  be  used  for the "E" key if VISUAL is undefined or empty.  Defaults to
               "vim".

       SHELL   Defines the shell that ranger is going to use with the :shell command and the "S" key.   Defaults
               to "<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>".

       TERMCMD Defines  the terminal emulator command that ranger is going to use with the :terminal command and
               the "t" run flag.  Defaults to "xterm".

       BAT_STYLE
               Specifies the theme to be used for syntax highlighting when <u>bat</u> is installed, unless <u>highlight</u> is
               also installed. Find out possible values by running "bat --list-themes".

       PYGMENTIZE_STYLE
               Specifies the theme to be used for syntax  highlighting  when  <u>pygmentize</u>  is  installed,  unless
               <u>highlight</u> is also installed. Find out possible values by running:
                python -c 'import pygments.styles; [print(stl) for stl in
                pygments.styles.<b>get_all_styles()</b>]'

       HIGHLIGHT_STYLE
               Specifies  the  theme  to  be  used for syntax highlighting when <u>highlight</u> is installed. Find out
               possible values by running "highlight --list-themes".

       HIGHLIGHT_TABWIDTH
               Specifies the number of spaces to use to replace tabs in <u>highlight</u>ed files.

       HIGHLIGHT_OPTIONS
               <u>highlight</u> will pick up command line options specified  in  this  variable.  A  "--style="  option
               specified  here  will  override  "HIGHLIGHT_STYLE".  Similarly,  "--replace-tabs="  will override
               "HIGHLIGHT_TABWIDTH".

       OPENSCAD_COLORSCHEME
               Specifies the colorscheme used by <u>openscad</u> while previewing 3D models. Read <u>openscad</u> man page for
               colorschemes. Ranger will default to Tomorrow Night.

       OPENSCAD_IMGSIZE
               Specifies the internal resolution <u>openscad</u> will use for rendering 3D models.  The image  will  be
               downscaled  to  fit  the preview pane. This resolution will default to "1000,1000" if no value is
               set.

       XDG_CONFIG_HOME
               Specifies the directory for configuration files. Defaults to <u>$HOME/.config</u>.

       PYTHONOPTIMIZE
               This variable determines the optimize level of python.

               Using PYTHONOPTIMIZE=1 (like python -O) will make python discard assertion statements.  You  will
               gain efficiency at the cost of losing some debug info.

               Using  PYTHONOPTIMIZE=2  (like  python -OO) will additionally discard any docstrings.  Using this
               will disable the &lt;F1&gt; key on commands.

       W3MIMGDISPLAY_PATH
               By changing this variable, you can change the path of the executable file for image previews.  By
               default, it is set to <u>/usr/lib/w3m/w3mimgdisplay</u>.
