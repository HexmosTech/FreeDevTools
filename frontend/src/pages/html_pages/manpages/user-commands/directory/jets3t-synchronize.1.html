</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       jets3t-synchronize - synchronize local directories with an Amazon S3 account

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Synchronize the contents of a local directory with S3:
         jets3t-synchronize [options] UP &lt;S3path&gt; &lt;path1&gt; [[path2] .. [pathN]]

       Synchronize the contents of S3 with a local directory:
         jets3t-synchronize [options] DOWN &lt;S3path&gt; &lt;download_dir&gt;

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       jets3t-synchronize  is a console (text mode) Java application for synchronizing directories on a computer
       with an Amazon S3 account.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
         Displays a brief summary with all options.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--noaction</b>
         No action taken. No files will be changed locally or on S3, instead a report will be generating showing
         what will happen if the command is run without the -n option.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
         Runs quietly, without reporting on each action performed or displaying progress messages.  The  summary
         is still displayed.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--noprogress</b>
         Runs somewhat quietly, without displaying progress messages.  The action report and overall summary are
         still displayed.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--force</b>
         Force  tool  to perform synchronization even when files are up-to-date.  This may be useful if you need
         to update metadata or timestamps in S3.

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--keepfiles</b>
         Keep outdated files on destination instead of reverting/removing them.  This option cannot be used with
         --nodelete.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--nodelete</b>
         Keep files on destination that have been removed from the source. This option is similar to --keepfiles
         except that files may be reverted.  This option cannot be used with --keepfiles.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--move</b>
         Move items rather than merely copying them. Files on the local computer will be deleted after they have
         been uploaded to S3, or objects will be deleted from S3 after they  have  been  downloaded.  Be  *very*
         careful with this option.  This option cannot be used with --keepfiles.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--batch</b>
         Download  or  upload  files  in  batches, rather than all at once. Enabling this option will reduce the
         memory required to synchronize large buckets, and will  ensure  file  transfers  commence  as  soon  as
         possible. When this option is enabled, the progress status lines refer only to the progress of a single
         batch.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--skipmetadata</b>
         Skip the retrieval of object metadata information from S3. This will make the synch process much faster
         for  large  buckets,  but  it will leave jets3t-synchronize with less information to make decisions. If
         this option is enabled, empty files or directories will not  be  synchronized  reliably.   This  option
         cannot be used with the --gzip or --crypto options.

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--gzip</b>
         Compress (GZip) files when backing up and decompress gzipped files when restoring.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--crypto</b>
         Encrypt  files  when backing up and decrypt encrypted files when restoring. If this option is specified
         the properties must contain a password.

       <b>--properties</b> <u>filename</u>
         Load the synchronizer app properties from the given file rather  than  from  a  synchronizer.properties
         file in the classpath.

       <b>--credentials</b> <u>filename</u>
         Load  your  AWS  credentials from an encrypted file, rather than from the synchronizer.properties file.
         This encrypted file can be created using the Cockpit application, or the JetS3t API library.

       <b>--acl</b> <u>ACL_string</u>
         Specifies the Access Control List setting to apply. This value must be one  of:  PRIVATE,  PUBLIC_READ,
         PUBLIC_READ_WRITE.  This setting will override any acl property specified in the synchronize.properties
         file

       <b>--reportlevel</b> <u>level</u>
         A number that specifies how much report information will be printed:

         0 - no report items will be printed (the summary will still be printed).

         1 - only actions are reported

         [Prefixes N, U, D, R, F, M]

         2 - differences &amp; actions are reported

         [Prefixes N, U, D, R, F, M, d, r]

         3 - DEFAULT: all items are reported

         [Prefixes N, U, D, R, F, M, d, r, -]

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Required properties can be provided via:  a  file  named  <u>synchronize.properties</u>  in  the  classpath  (or
       <u>/etc/jets3t/synchronize.properties</u>),  a file specified with the --properties option, or by typing them in
       when prompted on the command line. Required properties are:

       accesskey: Your AWS Access Key (Required)
       secretkey: Your AWS Secret Key (Required)
       password: Encryption password (only required when using crypto)

       Properties   specified   in   this   file   will   override   those   in   <u>jets3t.properties</u>    (or    in
       <u>/etc/jets3t/jets3t.properties</u>).

</pre><h4><b>REPORT</b></h4><pre>
       Report  items  are printed on a single line with an action flag followed by the relative path of the file
       or S3 object. The report legend follows:

       N: A new file/object will be created

       U: An existing file/object has changed and will be updated

       D: A file/object existing on the target does not exist on the source and will be deleted.

       d: A file/object existing on the target does not exist on the  source  but  because  the  --keepfiles  or
       --nodelete option was set it was not deleted.

       R: An existing file/object has changed more recently on the target than on the source. The target version
       will be reverted to the older source version

       r:  An  existing  file/object  has changed more recently on the target than on the source but because the
       --keepfiles option was set it was not reverted.

       -: A file is identical between the local system and S3, no action is necessary.

       F: A file identical locally and in S3 was updated due to the Force option.

       M: The file/object will be moved (deleted after it has been copied to/from S3).
