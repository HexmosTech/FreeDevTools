</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pictor-unload  -  unload pictures from a SOURCE removable media to DESTINATION directory, and rename each
       file, prepending the timestamp

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pictor-unload</b> <b>SOURCE</b> <b>DESTINATION</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>pictor-unload</b> utility  is  useful  for  unloading  pictures  from  removable  media,  collating,  and
       interleaving them with other pictures.

       The tool takes two arguments, the SOURCE directory, and the DESTINATION directory.

       Each file in the SOURCE directory is copied (preserving all attributes) to the DESTINATION directory.  At
       the  destination,  the  file is renamed, prepending a timestamp in the form of "YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS__" to
       the beginning of the filename.  The timestamp is taken to be that of  the  file's  original  modification
       time, as determined by the <b><a href="../man1/stat.1.html">stat</a></b>(1) utility.  A "double-underscore", ie, "__" separates the timestamp from
       the  original  filename.   File permissions at the destination are also adjusted, removing the executable
       bit which is typically set in the source, since the source is usually a VFAT filesystem.

       If you perfectly synchronize the embedded clock on each of several cameras, you can use <b>pictor-unload</b>  to
       conveniently combine and interleave pictures from these cameras.

       The  SOURCE directory is renamed, appending the current timestamp to the folder, thus noting "when" these
       pictures were unloaded.  Your camera will create a new directory  on  the  media  when  you  take  a  new
       picture.   <b>pictor-unload</b>  assumes  that  it  is your right and responsibility to delete pictures from the
       media or reformat the card.

       Finally, if the source directory is in <a href="file:/media">/media</a>, then you are prompted, asking if you want to  unmount  the
       source filesystem.  Note that this will required root privileges via <b><a href="../man8/sudo.8.html">sudo</a></b>(8).
