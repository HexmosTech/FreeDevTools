</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ls, lc - list contents of directory

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ls</b> [ <b>-dlmnpqrstuFQ</b> ] <u>name</u> <u>...</u>

       <b>lc</b> [ <b>-dlmnpqrstuFQ</b> ] <u>name</u> <u>...</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       For  each  directory argument, <u>ls</u> lists the contents of the directory; for each file argument, <u>ls</u> repeats
       its name and any other information requested.  When no  argument  is  given,  the  current  directory  is
       listed.  By default, the output is sorted alphabetically by name.

       <u>Lc</u> is the same as <u>ls</u>, but sets the <b>-p</b> option and pipes the output through <u><a href="../man1/mc.1.html">mc</a></u>(1).

       There are a number of options:

       <b>-d</b>     If argument is a directory, list it, not its contents.

       <b>-l</b>     List  in  long  format,  giving  mode (see below), file system type (e.g., for devices, the <b>#</b> code
              letter that names it; see <u><a href="../man3/intro.3.html">intro</a></u>(3)), the instance or  subdevice  number,  owner,  group,  size  in
              bytes, and time of last modification for each file.

       <b>-m</b>     List the name of the user who most recently modified the file.

       <b>-n</b>     Don't sort the listing.

       <b>-p</b>     Print only the final path element of each file name.

       <b>-q</b>     List  the  <u>qid</u>  (see <u><a href="../man3/stat.3.html">stat</a></u>(3)) of each file; the printed fields are in the order path, version, and
              type.

       <b>-r</b>     Reverse the order of sort.

       <b>-s</b>     Give size in Kbytes for each entry.

       <b>-t</b>     Sort by time modified (latest first) instead of by name.

       <b>-u</b>     Under <b>-t</b> sort by time of last access; under <b>-l</b> print time of last access.

       <b>-F</b>     Add the character <b>/</b> after all directory names and the character <b>*</b> after all executable files.

       <b>-L</b>     Print the character <b>t</b> before each file if it has the temporary flag set, and <b>-</b> otherwise.

       <b>-Q</b>     By default, printed file names are quoted if they contain characters special  to  <u><a href="../man1/rc.1.html">rc</a></u>(1).   The  <b>-Q</b>
              flag disables this behavior.

       The  mode printed under the <b>-l</b> option contains 11 characters, interpreted as follows: the first character
       is

       <b>d</b>      if the entry is a directory;

       <b>a</b>      if the entry is an append-only file;

       <b>D</b>      if the entry is a Unix device;

       <b>L</b>      if the entry is a symbolic link;

       <b>P</b>      if the entry is a named pipe;

       <b>S</b>      if the entry is a socket;

       <b>-</b>      if the entry is a plain file.

       The next letter is <b>l</b> if the file is exclusive access (one writer or reader at a time).

       The last 9 characters are interpreted as three sets of three bits each.  The first set  refers  to  owner
       permissions;  the  next  to  permissions  to  others  in the same user-group; and the last to all others.
       Within each set the three characters indicate permission respectively to read, to write,  or  to  execute
       the file as a program.  For a directory, `execute' permission is interpreted to mean permission to search
       the directory for a specified file.  The permissions are indicated as follows:

       <b>r</b>  if the file is readable;
       <b>w</b>  if the file is writable;
       <b>x</b>  if the file is executable;
       <b>-</b>  if none of the above permissions is granted.
