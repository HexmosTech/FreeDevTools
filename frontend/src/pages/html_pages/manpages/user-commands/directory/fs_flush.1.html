</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fs_flush - Forces the Cache Manager to discard a cached file or directory

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fs</b> <b>flush</b> [<b>-path</b> &lt;<u>dir/file</u> <u>path</u>&gt;+] [<b>-help</b>]

       <b>fs</b> <b>flush</b> [<b>-p</b> &lt;<u>dir/file</u> <u>path</u>&gt;+] [<b>-h</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>fs</b> <b>flush</b> command removes from the cache all data and status information associated with each
       specified file or directory. The next time an application requests data from the flushed directory or
       file, the Cache Manager fetches the most current version from a File Server, along with a new callback
       (if necessary) and associated status information. This command has no effect on two types of data:

       •   Data in application program buffers.

       •   Data  that  has  been changed locally and written to the cache but not yet written to the copy on the
           file server machine.

       To flush all data in the cache that was fetched from the same volume as a specified  file  or  directory,
       use the <b>fs</b> <b>flushvolume</b> command.  To flush a corrupted mount point, use the <b>fs</b> <b>flushmount</b> command.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-path</b> &lt;<u>dir/file</u> <u>path</u>&gt;+
           Names  each  file  or  directory  to  flush  from the cache. If it is a directory, only the directory
           element itself is flushed, not data cached from files or subdirectories that reside  in  it.  Partial
           pathnames  are interpreted relative to the current working directory, which is also the default value
           if this argument is omitted.

       <b>-help</b>
           Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following command flushes from the cache the file "projectnotes" in the current working directory and
       all data from the subdirectory "plans":

          % fs flush -path projectnotes ./plans/*

</pre><h4><b>PRIVILEGE</b> <b>REQUIRED</b></h4><pre>
       The issuer must have the "l" (lookup) permission on the ACL of the root  directory  of  the  volume  that
       houses  the file or directory named by the <b>-path</b> argument, and on the ACL of each directory that precedes
       it in the pathname.
