</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cd — change the working directory

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       cd <b>[</b>-L|-P<b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>directory</u><b>]</b>

       cd -

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>cd</u> utility shall change the working directory of the current shell execution environment (see <u>Section</u>
       <u>2.12</u>, <u>Shell</u> <u>Execution</u> <u>Environment</u>) by executing the following steps in sequence. (In the following steps,
       the  symbol  <b>curpath</b>  represents  an intermediate value used to simplify the description of the algorithm
       used by <u>cd</u>.  There is no requirement that <b>curpath</b> be made visible to the application.)

        1. If no <u>directory</u> operand is given and the <u>HOME</u> environment variable is empty or undefined, the default
           behavior is implementation-defined and no further steps shall be taken.

        2. If no <u>directory</u> operand is given and the <u>HOME</u> environment variable is set to a non-empty  value,  the
           <u>cd</u>  utility  shall behave as if the directory named in the <u>HOME</u> environment variable was specified as
           the <u>directory</u> operand.

        3. If the <u>directory</u> operand begins with a &lt;slash&gt; character, set <b>curpath</b> to the operand and  proceed  to
           step 7.

        4. If the first component of the <u>directory</u> operand is dot or dot-dot, proceed to step 6.

        5. Starting  with  the  first pathname in the &lt;colon&gt;-separated pathnames of <u>CDPATH</u> (see the ENVIRONMENT
           VARIABLES section) if the pathname is non-null, test if the concatenation of that pathname, a &lt;slash&gt;
           character if that pathname did not end with a &lt;slash&gt; character, and the <u>directory</u>  operand  names  a
           directory.  If  the  pathname is null, test if the concatenation of dot, a &lt;slash&gt; character, and the
           operand names a directory. In either case, if the resulting string names an existing  directory,  set
           <b>curpath</b>  to  that string and proceed to step 7. Otherwise, repeat this step with the next pathname in
           <u>CDPATH</u> until all pathnames have been tested.

        6. Set <b>curpath</b> to the <u>directory</u> operand.

        7. If the <b>-P</b> option is in effect, proceed to  step  10.  If  <b>curpath</b>  does  not  begin  with  a  &lt;slash&gt;
           character,  set  <b>curpath</b>  to  the  string  formed by the concatenation of the value of <u>PWD</u>, a &lt;slash&gt;
           character if the value of <u>PWD</u> did not end with a &lt;slash&gt; character, and <b>curpath</b>.

        8. The <b>curpath</b> value shall then be converted to canonical form as follows,  considering  each  component
           from beginning to end, in sequence:

            a. Dot  components  and  any  &lt;slash&gt; characters that separate them from the next component shall be
               deleted.

            b. For each dot-dot component, if there is a preceding component and it is neither root nor dot-dot,
               then:

                i.  If the preceding component does not refer  (in  the  context  of  pathname  resolution  with
                    symbolic  links  followed)  to a directory, then the <u>cd</u> utility shall display an appropriate
                    error message and no further steps shall be taken.

               ii.  The preceding component, all &lt;slash&gt; characters separating the preceding component from dot-
                    dot, dot-dot, and all &lt;slash&gt; characters separating dot-dot from the following component (if
                    any) shall be deleted.

            c. An implementation may further simplify <b>curpath</b> by removing any trailing &lt;slash&gt;  characters  that
               are  not  also  leading  &lt;slash&gt;  characters,  replacing multiple non-leading consecutive &lt;slash&gt;
               characters with a single &lt;slash&gt;, and replacing three or more leading &lt;slash&gt; characters  with  a
               single  &lt;slash&gt;.   If,  as  a  result  of this canonicalization, the <b>curpath</b> variable is null, no
               further steps shall be taken.

        9. If <b>curpath</b> is longer than {PATH_MAX} bytes (including the terminating null) and the <u>directory</u> operand
           was not longer than {PATH_MAX}  bytes  (including  the  terminating  null),  then  <b>curpath</b>  shall  be
           converted  from  an absolute pathname to an equivalent relative pathname if possible. This conversion
           shall always be considered possible if the value of <u>PWD</u>, with a trailing &lt;slash&gt; added if it does not
           already have one, is an initial substring of <b>curpath</b>.  Whether or not it is considered possible under
           other circumstances is unspecified. Implementations may also apply this conversion if <b>curpath</b> is  not
           longer than {PATH_MAX} bytes or the <u>directory</u> operand was longer than {PATH_MAX} bytes.

       10. The  <u>cd</u>  utility shall then perform actions equivalent to the <u>chdir</u>() function called with <b>curpath</b> as
           the <u>path</u> argument. If these actions fail for any reason, the <u>cd</u> utility shall display an  appropriate
           error  message  and  the  remainder  of  this  step shall not be executed. If the <b>-P</b> option is not in
           effect, the <u>PWD</u> environment variable shall be set to the value that <b>curpath</b> had on entry  to  step  9
           (i.e.,  before conversion to a relative pathname). If the <b>-P</b> option is in effect, the <u>PWD</u> environment
           variable shall be set to the string that would be  output  by  <u>pwd</u>  <b>-P</b>.   If  there  is  insufficient
           permission on the new directory, or on any parent of that directory, to determine the current working
           directory, the value of the <u>PWD</u> environment variable is unspecified.

       If,  during the execution of the above steps, the <u>PWD</u> environment variable is set, the <u>OLDPWD</u> environment
       variable shall also be set to the value of the  old  working  directory  (that  is  the  current  working
       directory immediately prior to the call to <u>cd</u>).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>cd</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>12.2</u>, <u>Utility</u> <u>Syntax</u>
       <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The following options shall be supported by the implementation:

       <b>-L</b>        Handle  the  operand  dot-dot  logically; symbolic link components shall not be resolved before
                 dot-dot components are processed (see steps 8.  and 9. in the DESCRIPTION).

       <b>-P</b>        Handle the operand dot-dot physically; symbolic link components shall be resolved  before  dot-
                 dot components are processed (see step 7. in the DESCRIPTION).

       If  both <b>-L</b> and <b>-P</b> options are specified, the last of these options shall be used and all others ignored.
       If neither <b>-L</b> nor <b>-P</b> is specified, the operand shall be handled dot-dot logically; see the DESCRIPTION.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <u>directory</u> An absolute or relative pathname of the directory that shall become the new working  directory.
                 The interpretation of a relative pathname by <u>cd</u> depends on the <b>-L</b> option and the <u>CDPATH</u> and <u>PWD</u>
                 environment variables. If <u>directory</u> is an empty string, the results are unspecified.

       -         When a &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; is used as the operand, this shall be equivalent to the command:

                     cd "$OLDPWD" &amp;&amp; pwd

                 which changes to the previous working directory and then writes its name.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>cd</u>:

       <u>CDPATH</u>    A  &lt;colon&gt;-separated list of pathnames that refer to directories. The <u>cd</u> utility shall use this
                 list in its attempt to change the directory, as described in the DESCRIPTION. An  empty  string
                 in  place  of  a  directory pathname represents the current directory. If <u>CDPATH</u> is not set, it
                 shall be treated as if it were an empty string.

       <u>HOME</u>      The name of the directory, used when no <u>directory</u> operand is specified.

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u>  <u>Variables</u>  for  the
                 precedence   of   internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values  of  locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the  other  internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine  the  locale  for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to  affect  the  format  and  contents  of  diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

       <u>OLDPWD</u>    A pathname of the previous working directory, used by <u>cd</u> <b>-</b>.

       <u>PWD</u>       This  variable  shall  be set as specified in the DESCRIPTION. If an application sets or unsets
                 the value of <u>PWD</u>, the behavior of <u>cd</u> is unspecified.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       If a non-empty directory name from <u>CDPATH</u> is used, or if <u>cd</u> <b>-</b> is used, an absolute pathname  of  the  new
       working directory shall be written to the standard output as follows:

           "%s\n", &lt;<u>new</u> <u>directory</u>&gt;

       Otherwise, there shall be no output.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    The directory was successfully changed.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The working directory shall remain unchanged.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Since <u>cd</u> affects the current shell execution environment, it is always provided as a shell regular built-
       in.  If  it  is  called  in  a  subshell  or  separate  utility execution environment, such as one of the
       following:

           (cd <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>)
           nohup cd
           find . -exec cd {} \;

       it does not affect the working directory of the caller's environment.

       The user must have execute (search) permission in <u>directory</u> in order to change to it.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following template can be used to perform processing in the directory specified by <u>location</u>  and  end
       up in the current working directory in use before the first <u>cd</u> command was issued:

           cd <u>location</u>
           if [ $? -ne 0 ]
           then
               print error message
               exit 1
           fi
           ... do whatever is desired as long as the OLDPWD environment variable
               is not modified
           cd -

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The  use  of the <u>CDPATH</u> was introduced in the System V shell. Its use is analogous to the use of the <u>PATH</u>
       variable in the shell. The BSD C shell used a shell parameter <u>cdpath</u> for this purpose.

       A common extension when <u>HOME</u> is undefined is to get the login directory from the user  database  for  the
       invoking user. This does not occur on System V implementations.

       Some  historical  shells, such as the KornShell, took special actions when the directory name contained a
       dot-dot component, selecting the  logical  parent  of  the  directory,  rather  than  the  actual  parent
       directory;  that  is,  it  moved  up  one level toward the <b>'/'</b> in the pathname, remembering what the user
       typed, rather than performing the equivalent of:

           chdir("..");

       In such a shell, the  following  commands  would  not  necessarily  produce  equivalent  output  for  all
       directories:

           cd .. &amp;&amp; ls      ls ..

       This  behavior is now the default. It is not consistent with the definition of dot-dot in most historical
       practice; that is, while this behavior has been optionally available in the KornShell, other shells  have
       historically  not  supported  this  functionality.  The logical pathname is stored in the <u>PWD</u> environment
       variable when the <u>cd</u> utility completes and this value is used to construct the next directory name if  <u>cd</u>
       is invoked with the <b>-L</b> option.
