       makepp_repositories -- How to use repositories for variant builds, for maintaining a central set of
       sources, and other things

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A <b>repository</b> is a directory or directory hierarchy outside of the default directory that contains files
       which the makefile needs in the current directory tree.  Makepp can automatically link files from the
       repository into the current directory tree if they are needed.  Repositories provide similar
       functionality to the "VPATH" variable, but (unlike "VPATH" in other versions of make) you do not have to
       do anything special to your makefile to get them to work.

       Repositories are specified with the "-R" or "--repository" command line option or with the "repository"
       statement in the makefile.  Note that if you have a habit of calling makepp in different subdirectories
       of your build tree, it is easy to accidentally reimport a repository somewhere else.  As a safeguard
       against this, if you use <u>RootMakeppfile</u>, makepp will refuse to start if it finds one above or below where
       it would be imported.

       This is somewhat comparable to operating system union filesystems (unionfs...)  The current directory is
       like the highest level writable layer.  All repositories are like lower read-only layers.

       Repositories are useful in several different situations:

       •   When  you want to place your object and executable files in a separate directory, but the makefile is
           written to place them in the same directory as the sources.

       •   When you want to build the same program  two  different  ways  (e.g.,  with  two  different  sets  of
           compilation options, or for two different architectures).

       •   When you don't have write access to all or part of the source tree.

       •   When  several  developers  are  working  on the same project, and there is a common source repository
           containing all the sources for the project.  Each developer can modify only the  files  he  needs  to
           change  in  his local directory without affecting the other developers, and makepp will automatically
           fetch the unmodified files from the source repository.

       Makepp's implementation of repositories does not require rewriting of the build commands at  all,  unlike
       (for  example) repositories in cons.  Makepp puts a symbolic link into the directory where the command is
       expecting it.  As long as the command does not refer  to  absolute  directories,  the  exact  same  shell
       command  will  work  with  files  from  a  repository.  This means that it works not only for compilation
       commands, but any kind of command you can think to put in your makefile.

       Makepp has another kind of mechanism called a <u>build</u> <u>cache</u> which solves some of the same sorts of problems
       as repositories in a different way.  Depending on your problem, a build cache may be more useful  than  a
       repository.   See  makepp_build_cache for information about build caches and a comparison of build caches
       and repositories.

   <b>Examples</b>
       Repositories are best explained by several examples of what you can do.

       <u>Different</u> <u>compilation</u> <u>options</u>

       Suppose you have a simple program with a makefile that looks something like this:

           CFLAGS      = -O2
           OBJECTS = a.o b.o c.o
           my_program: $(OBJECTS)
               cc $(inputs) -o $(output)

           %.o: %.c
               cc $(CFLAGS) -c $(input) -o $(output)

       This makefile places the files "a.o", "b.o", "c.o", and "my_program" in the same directory as the  source
       files.

       Sometimes  you  want  to  place the binary files into a separate directory.  For example, you might build
       your program on several different architectures, and you don't want the binary files on one  architecture
       to  be  replaced  with  the  binary files on the other.  Or you might want to make a temporary change and
       recompile without wiping out the previous compilation results.  Without repositories, you would  have  to
       modify your makefile to place the objects elsewhere.

       With  a  repository,  however,  you  don't  have  to  touch your makefile at all.  Consider the following
       sequence of commands:

           % cd my_program_source
           % makepp                    # Builds using the above makefile, and
                                       # object files go into the directory
                                       # my_program_source.
           % cd ..
           % mkdir binary-debug        # Make a clean directory for building the
           % cd binary-debug           # same program with different options.
           % makepp -R ../my_program_source CFLAGS=-g
                                       # Now objects go into binary-debug.

       The first makepp command compiles the source files with  optimization  and  puts  the  objects  into  the
       directory  "my_program_source",  because  that's  what  the  makefile  is supposed to do.  Now we want to
       rebuild the program, but we want to change the value of "CFLAGS" to compile for debug.   We  specify  the
       new value of "CFLAGS" on the command line, and we also tell makepp that the "my_program_source" directory
       is a repository using the "-R" option.

       Every  time  makepp  realizes  that it needs a file that it doesn't already have in current directory, it
       looks in the repository.  In this case, it first looks for the  makefile,  which  doesn't  exist  in  the
       "binary-debug"   subdirectory.    So   it   creates   a   symbolic  link  to  it  from  the  makefile  in
       "my_program_source", and then reads in the makefile.  Then it notices that it needs  the  file  "a.c"  in
       order  to  build  "a.o",  and  so  it  links  in  "a.c" from the repository.  If "a.c" includes any files
       contained in "my_program_source", then these will be automatically linked in as well.  Note: Those  links
       are useful for things like debugging, but if you don't like them, "makeppclean -R" can remove them.

       Running  the  build  command in "binary-debug" won't touch any of the files in "my_program_source".  Thus
       from the same set of source files, you now have two different copies of the program,  one  compiled  with
       optimization and one compiled for debug.  And this happened without touching the makefile at all.

       The  advantage  of using repositories instead of simply recompiling and overwriting the original binaries
       is that now if we fix our bugs and want to go back to the optimized version, we don't have  to  recompile
       everything.   Since  the original object files are still around, and most of them are still valid, we can
       save a lot of time on recompilation.  This does not make a big difference when only  three  source  files
       are  involved,  but for a larger build that takes minutes or hours to complete, the savings in programmer
       time and frustration can be significant.

       <u>Rebuilding</u> <u>one</u> <u>file</u> <u>with</u> <u>a</u> <u>minor</u> <u>modification</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>compilation</u> <u>commands</u>

       Makepp doesn't fetch only source files from the repository.  If the object files in the repository  don't
       need rebuilding, it will use them.  For example, consider a slight modification to the above makefile:

           CFLAGS   := -O2
           A_CFLAGS := -O6 -funroll-loops

           OBJECTS := a.o b.o c.o

           my_program: $(OBJECTS)
               cc $(inputs) -o $(output)

           %.o: %.c
               cc $(CFLAGS) -c $(input) -o $(output)

           a.o: a.c
               cc $(A_CFLAGS) -c $(input) -o $(output)

       The  idea  is that "a.o" contains the time-critical code, so it is compiled with higher optimization than
       the rest of the objects.  Now suppose we want to test just how different the  timing  is  with  different
       compile options.  A repository can help with this, too:

           % cd my_program_source
           % makepp                    # Builds using the above makefile, and
                                       # object files go into the directory
                                       # my_program_source.
           % cd ..
           % mkdir no-unrolling        # Make a clean directory for building the
           % cd no-unrolling           # same program with different options.
           % makepp -R ../my_program_source A_CFLAGS=-O2
           % cd ..
           % time no-unrolling/my_program # Benchmark the two versions of the program.
           % time my_program_source/my_program

       Makepp  proceeds  as  before, linking in a copy of the makefile and then examining the object files.  Now
       only the "a.o" module needs recompiling, since the options for "b.o" and "c.o" haven't  changed.   Makepp
       notices that it can use "b.o" and "c.o" from the repository, so it just links those in.  However, it will
       recompile  "a.o"  in  the  "no-unrolling" directory.  Once the compilation is finished, the two different
       versions of the program can be benchmarked.

       <u>Rebuilding</u> <u>with</u> <u>a</u> <u>minor</u> <u>modification</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>source</u>

       Now suppose we want to make a change to "a.c" and benchmark the program  before  and  after  the  change.
       Repositories can help again.  Consider this sequence of commands:

           % mkdir modified-a
           % cp my_program_source/a.c modified-a
           % cd modified-a
           % emacs a.c                 # Make some modifications just to this module.
           % makepp -R ../my_program_source

       Here we have created a new directory that just contains the single source file we want to modify.  Makepp
       now  takes  "a.c"  from  the  "modified-a"  subdirectory,  but  uses  the  copies of "b" and "c" from the
       "my_program_source" directory.  Without changing any of the binary files in "my_program_source", we  have
       created  a  separate  copy  of  the  program  that incorporates our changes to "a.c".  If there are other
       developers using the sources in "my_program_source", they will be unaffected by our changes.

       Repositories can thus be used as a quick way to build variants of a program, without  adding  complicated
       conditions  to  the makefile.  None of the files in the original directory are modified; they are used as
       needed.

       <u>Using</u> <u>a</u> <u>directory</u> <u>hierarchy</u>

       A repository is actually not just a single directory, it's a whole directory hierarchy.  Suppose you  use
       <u>/our/library</u>   as   a   repository.   Now  <u>/our/library</u>  may  well  contain  many  subdirectories,  e.g.,
       <u>/our/library/gui</u> and <u>/our/library/network</u>.  Consider this command:

           % makepp -R /our/library

       Any commands in the makefile that refer to files in the directory <u>./network</u> will actually get files  from
       <u>/our/library/network</u>,  and  similarly for <u>./gui</u>.  Makepp automatically creates any directories that exist
       in the repository but not in the current directory.

       <u>Linking</u> <u>to</u> <u>any</u> <u>place</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>file</u> <u>system</u>

       All of the above examples show files from a repository being linked into the  current  directory  or  its
       subdirectories,  but  you  can  actually have makepp link them into any place in the file system that you
       have write access to.  This is done by specifying "-R new-location=old-location".

       For example, sometimes it's a little tedious to type the following:

              mkdir alternate-build
              cd alternate-build
              makepp -R ..

       You can do it all with one command, like this:

              makepp -R alternate-build=. -F alternate-build

       "-F" or "-makeppfile" changes to that directory before loading  the  makefile.   You  must  specify  "-R"
       before  "-F".   Note that this example puts the new build tree inside the repository.  That will not work
       if you use a <u>RootMakeppfile</u> because makepp safeguards against nested trees.  It's also not a good idea if
       you use <u>**</u>, because if you ever build in the repository it will also find edited and generated  files  in
       this subtree.

       Assigning  a  different location in the file system may be also useful for more complicated builds, where
       there are several library subdirectories.  For example, here's a command I have used to build variants of
       one of my programs:

           % makepp -R test-build/seescape=/src/seescape \
                -R test-build/HLib=/src/HLib \
                -R test-build/H5pp=/src/H5pp \
                -R qwt=/src/external_libraries/qwt \
                -F test-build/seescape

       This command loads in files from four different repositories, and then cds to  the  <u>./test-build/seescape</u>
       directory  and  executes  the  makefile  there.   Files  contained  in  the directory tree beginning with
       <u>/src/seescape</u> are linked into <u>./test-build/seescape</u>.  In other words, makepp will  temporarily  link  the
       file  <u>/src/seescape/gui/image_canvas.cxx</u> to <u>./test-build/seescape/gui/image_canvas.cxx</u> when it is needed.
       This command will work even if the "test-build" directory doesn't exist yet; makepp will  create  it  for
       you.  (But you must specify the "-R" options before the "-F" option on the command line.)

       <u>Multiple</u> <u>equivalent</u> <u>repositories</u>

       Say  your  project  is  maintained  by  several  fairly  autonomous  groups.  You could have one complete
       repository with all the sources as they are in production or at least successfully tested.   Every  group
       can  have a mostly empty repository with (part of) the same structure, containing the files group members
       have finished developing.

       Developers' current directories will have the files they are still working on.  The group repository will
       be the first one given and the production repository the last one, so that it  furnishes  the  files  not
       found in the group repository:

           $ makepp -R/path/to/group/repository -R/path/to/production/repository

       Since this is probably fairly static for that directory, you may want to put a file <u>.makepprc</u> at its root
       with the following content:

           -R/path/to/group/repository -R/path/to/production/repository

       Or, presuming that it has a fixed path, you could write into your makefile:

           repository /path/to/production/repository

       and, because options are seen before makefiles are read, you can then call just

           $ makepp -R/path/to/group/repository

       <u>Repositories</u> <u>as</u> <u>fixed</u> <u>part</u> <u>of</u> <u>your</u> <u>build</u> <u>system</u>

       If  you  know  you  always use some repository you can use the "repository" or "vpath" statements in your
       makefile.

   <b>Caveats</b> <b>with</b> <b>repositories</b>
       <u>When</u> <u>the</u> <u>links</u> <u>get</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>way</u>

       For finding your way around your file hierarchy and for allowing the debugger to find the sources  it  is
       useful  to  have  the links used while building.  But when you want to edit a file or resync it with your
       version control, the links can get in the way.  That is because the system traverses the link and  writes
       to  the file in the repository.  Unless it's your personal repository used just for keeping things apart,
       that may not be what you want.

       As a safeguard against inadvertent overwriting of public files it is suggested to make the sources in the
       repository unwritable.  It might even not be enough to remove the write bit, because  a  version  control
       system  which  insists on your locking the files for editing might also do that, but temporarily make the
       file writable while resyncing it.  If that is the case for you, the repository should actually belong  to
       a different user.

       There are a few tactics to surmount this:

       •   Keep  the  sources you edit in a repository, separate from your build tree.  Whenever you put a file,
           which was previously fetched from another repository,  into  this  editing  repository,  makepp  will
           notice and fetch it from there, provided it is the first repository you specify.

       •   Remember  to  delete  any  file,  before  you create a copy for writing.  If you follow the safeguard
           suggestion above, forgetting to do this will give an error message when writing.  To  help  you,  the
           following function "delink" will replace one link by a copy of the linked file.  The first variant is
           for all kinds of Bournish Shells, the second one for csh (or at least tcsh):

               $ delink() { { rm $1 &amp;&amp; cat &gt;$1; } &lt;$1; }
               % alias delink '( rm \!:1 &amp;&amp; cat &gt;\!:1; ) &lt;\!:1'

       •   If  you feel you don't need them, you can delete them all, whenever you want, e.g. after every makepp
           run, possibly backgrounded (either short or long form):

               makeppclean --recurse --only-repository-links
               mppc -rR

       <u>Don't</u> <u>build</u> <u>in</u> <u>a</u> <u>repository</u> <u>during</u> <u>use</u>

       A repository is meant to be read-only while it is being used as  a  repository.   Makepp  will  <b>not</b>  work
       properly  if  you change files in your repository during the course of a build.  Nightly builds may be ok
       for you, if no one else uses the repository at that time.  Before it starts the build, makepp gets a list
       of all the files that exist in the repository, and never updates its list, except for files it expects to
       appear.

       If you need a repository that's changing as you build, you might want to consider  makepp's  build  cache
       mechanism  (see  makepp_build_cache).   Alternatively, you can use a "poor man's repository": you can put
       explicit rules into your makefile to create the soft links, like this:

           %.c : $(directory_I_wish_was_a_repository)/%.c
               &amp;ln -fs $(input) $(output)

       This works only for source files; you can't easily use this to link a file if it is already built in  the
       repository,  but  build  it  here if it's not already built, since there is only allowed to be one way to
       build a file.

       <u>Use</u> <u>only</u> <u>relative</u> <u>filenames</u>

       Repositories work completely transparently <u>if</u> <u>the</u> <u>makefiles</u> <u>use</u> <u>only</u> <u>relative</u> <u>filenames</u>.   In  the  above
       example,  it's ok if the makefile in <u>/src/seescape</u> refers to <u>../HLib</u>, but the above command will not work
       as expected if it refers to <u>/src/HLib</u>.  If you need to use absolute file names, you  can  put  them  into
       make variables and then override them on the command line, like this:

           % makepp -R test-build/seescape=/src/seescape SEESCAPE=/home/holt/test-build/seescape \
                -R test-build/HLib=/src/HLib HLIB=/home/holt/test-build/HLib \
                -R test-build/H5pp=/src/H5pp H5pp=/home/holt/test-build/H5pp \
                -R qwt=/src/external_libraries/qwt QWT=/home/holt/test-build/qwt \
                -F test-build/seescape

       The  above  will  work  as long as the "HLib" directory is referred to as "$(HLIB)" in all the makefiles.
       Note  that  you  have  to  specify  absolute  paths  for  the  directories,  because   makepp   cd's   to
       "test-build/seescape" before reading the makefile.  This leads to long and complicated make commands; use
       relative paths when possible.

       <u>Makepp</u> <u>must</u> <u>know</u> <u>about</u> <u>all</u> <u>dependencies</u>

       Repositories  will  not  work if there are hidden dependencies that makepp doesn't know about.  (In fact,
       doing a build using repositories, is one way of checking for forgotten dependencies.  But, just for  this
       check, don't combine it with a build cache, since fetching something there, instead of building it, might
       hide  a  forgotten  dependency.)   Sometimes  these  dependencies can be fairly subtle.  For example, the
       <u>libtool</u> command will not only create ".lo" and ".la" files as listed on the command line, but it also may
       create a subdirectory called ".libs" which contains the actual object files.  To prevent build  mistakes,
       makepp refuses to link in a ".la" file from a repository.  Hopefully in the future libtool will be better
       supported.

       Many hidden dependencies related to compilation are caught by the command line scanner.  If your compiler
       uses  the  common  Unix  compilation  flags (e.g., "-I", "-D", etc.), then makepp will usually figure out
       where all your include files are.  You may have to be careful if you  have  any  homegrown  scripts  that
       create  files  that  makepp  doesn't know about.  For correct builds, it is vitally important to list <b>all</b>
       targets and dependencies (or determine them automatically by scanning).

       <u>Putting</u> <u>absolute</u> <u>filenames</u> <u>into</u> <u>programs</u>

       Repositories will also not work if any of the files built contain absolute file names in them  (e.g.,  if
       any  of  your  build  commands write out an absolute filename).  For example, it turns out that the ".la"
       files produced by <u>libtool</u> have this property.  (If you look at the contents of the ".la" file you'll  see
       that the dependency list contains absolute filenames.)  In order to solve this particular problem, makepp
       will not link ".la" files from a repository; it will insist on rebuilding them.

       <u>Avoid</u> <u>linking</u> <u>in</u> <u>unnecessary</u> <u>directories</u>

       Repositories  can  be  slow on startup and use a lot of memory if there are a lot of unnecessary files in
       the repository.  For example, if you use an automatic HTML documentation generator which makes  thousands
       of  ".html"  files  from  your source code, you may not want to put them in a subdirectory of a directory
       that's used as a repository.  It's better to put them in a different  directory  tree  entirely,  so  the
       repository mechanism won't load in their names.

       <u>Too</u> <u>Many</u> <u>Files</u>

       The  disadvantage  of  repositories  is  that  symbolic  links,  which the repository mechanism uses, are
       individual files (though they use almost no disk space).  This is unlike  real  links,  but  those  can't
       cross  file  system  boundaries.   In  extreme cases the presence of very many symbolic links can lead to
       exhaustion of the number of foreseen files (so called inodes), even though there is plenty of space left.
       In this case the sysadmin will need to tune the file system.

   <b>Overriding</b> <b>repository</b> <b>copies</b>
       If you make any modifications to a file locally, makepp will ordinarily realize this  and  recompile  the
       file using the local copy rather than the repository copy.

       If  you're  using  a repository to maintain a central code base, and you have developers working on local
       copies which contain only the files they have modified, one problem that comes up is: what if a developer
       wants to remove a file from his local build but the repository  still  contains  it?   If  the  developer
       removes  the  local  copy,  makepp  will  happily put in the copy from the repository, and the build will
       proceed as if the file existed.

       One technique (alas not for user root) for this problem is to make the file that you want not to  include
       in the build process unreadable, like this:

           chmod a-rw file-to-be-excluded

       This will prevent makepp from incorporating it from the repository.  Makepp also includes special code so
       that unreadable files do not match wildcards or pattern rules.

       Similarly,  to  prevent makepp from incorporating an entire subdirectory, make a local directory that has
       the same name but is unwritable.  If you want makepp to ignore  the  directory  entirely,  then  make  it
       unreadable too.  (Read-only directories are searched but targets in them are usually not built.)

       The other way to do this is calling makepp with one or more exclusion options:

           mpp -R /path/to/rep --dont-read=/path/to/rep/file-to-be-excluded

   <b>Don't</b> <b>use</b> <b>repositories</b> <b>for</b> <b>files</b> <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>change!</b>
       Don't  try to use a repository for a file which is part of your build.  For example, you might be tempted
       to try to use repositories to put all of your public .h files in the same directory, like this:

           # top level makefile
           repository include=module1/include
           repository include=module2/include
           repository include=module3/include
           repository include=module4/include

       This is probably not a good idea if <u>any</u> of the <u>.h</u> files are themselves outputs of a program  (e.g.,  yacc
       or  some  other  program that spits out C source code), because makepp assumes that files in repositories
       never change.  If the build needs <u>include/xyz.h</u>, and <u>module2/include/xyz.h</u> actually needs to be  produced
       by  some  program,  makepp will not know to run the program.  It's better to use a technique like this to
       put all of your <u>.h</u> files into a common include directory:

           # module1/Makeppfile
           ../include/%.h : include/%.h
               &amp;cp $(input) $(output)
           # You could also (more efficiently but problematic on Windows) do the following:
           #    &amp;ln -r $(input) $(output)

       Makepp might still try to build files that happen to be in  a  repository  if  something  asks  for  them
       directly,  but  it  won't  build  them <u>on</u> <u>behalf</u> of the local directory.  The result of this can be quite
       confusing, because it can lead to a repository symbolic link being used while its  repository  target  is
       out-of-date,  but  that target might get updated later in the build.  You can prevent this from happening
       either by making sure that the repository is referred to <u>only</u> through the repository path, or  by  making
       sure that there is also a local rule for all the generated repository files.

       Another  way  to  avoid recompiling identical files in different directories is to use a build cache (see
       makepp_build_cache for details).  A build cache does not have the  restriction  that  the  file  may  not
       change.
