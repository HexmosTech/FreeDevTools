</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tcpprep</b> - Create a tcpreplay cache cache file from a pcap file.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tcpprep</b> [<b>-flags</b>] [<b>-flag</b> [<u>value</u>]] [<b>--option-name</b>[[=| ]<u>value</u>]]

       All arguments must be options.

       tcpprep  is  a  <u><a href="../man3/pcap.3.html">pcap</a>(3)</u>  file  pre-processor  which  creates  a  cache  file  which  provides "rules" for
       <u><a href="../man1/tcprewrite.1.html">tcprewrite</a>(1)</u> and <u><a href="../man1/tcpreplay.1.html">tcpreplay</a>(1)</u> on how to process and send packets.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The basic operation of tcpreplay is to resend all packets from the  input  file(s)  out  a  single  file.
       Tcpprep  processes  a  pcap  file  and applies a set of user-specified rules to create a cache file which
       tells tcpreplay whether or not to send each packet and which interface the packet should be sent out of.

       For more details, please see the Tcpreplay Manual at: <a href="http://tcpreplay.appneta.com">http://tcpreplay.appneta.com</a>

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b> <u>number</u>, <b>--dbug</b>=<u>number</u> Enable debugging output.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This option
       takes an integer number as its argument.  The value of <u>number</u> is constrained to being:
           in the range  0 through 5
       The default <u>number</u> for this option is:
            0

       If configured with --enable-debug, then you can specify a verbosity level for debugging output.  Higher
       numbers increase verbosity.

       <b>-a</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--auto</b>=<u>string</u> Auto-split mode.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This option must not
       appear in combination with any of the following options: cidr, port, regex, mac.

       Tcpprep will try to automatically determine the primary function of hosts based on the traffic captured
       and classify each host as client or server.  In order to do so, you must provide a hint to tcpprep as to
       how to search for clients and servers.  Valid hints are:

       <b>bridge</b> Bridge mode processes each packet to try to determine if the sender is a client or server.  Once
       all the packets are processed, the results are weighed according to the server/client ratio (<b>--ratio</b>) and
       systems are assigned an interface.  If tcpprep is unable to determine what role a system plays, tcpprep
       will abort.

       <b>router</b> Router mode works just like bridge mode, except that after weighing is done, systems which are
       undetermined are considered a server if they fall inside a network known to contain other servers.
       Router has a greater chance of successfully splitting clients and servers but is not 100% foolproof.

       <b>client</b> Client mode works just like bridge mode, except that unclassified systems are treated as clients.
       Client mode should always complete successfully.

       <b>server</b> Server mode works just like bridge mode, except that unclassified systems are treated as servers.
       Server mode should always complete successfully.

       <b>first</b> First mode works by looking at the first time each IP is seen in the SRC and DST fields in the IP
       header.  If the host is first seen in the SRC field, it is a client and if it's first seen in the DST
       field, it is marked as a server.   This effectively replicates the processing of the tomahawk test tool.
       First mode should always complete successfully.

       <b>-c</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--cidr</b>=<u>string</u> CIDR-split mode.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This option must not
       appear in combination with any of the following options: auto, port, regex, mac.

       Specify a comma delimited list of CIDR netblocks to match against the source IP of each packet.  Packets
       matching any of the CIDR's are classified as servers.

       IPv4 Example:
           --cidr=192.168.0.0/16,172.16.0.0/12,10.0.0.0/8
       IPv6 Example:
           --cidr=[::ffff:0:0/96],[fe80::/16]

       <b>-r</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--regex</b>=<u>string</u> Regex-split mode.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This option must not
       appear in combination with any of the following options: auto, port, cidr, mac.

       Specify a regular expression to match against the source IP of each packet.  Packets matching the regex
       are classified as servers.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--port</b> Port-split mode.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This option must not appear in
       combination with any of the following options: auto, regex, cidr, mac.

       Specifies that TCP and UDP traffic over IPv4 and IPv6 should be classified as client or server based upon
       the destination port of the header.

       <b>-e</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--mac</b>=<u>string</u> Source MAC split mode.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This option must
       not appear in combination with any of the following options: auto, regex, cidr, port.

       Specify a list of MAC addresses to match against the source MAC of each packet.  Packets matching one of
       the values are classified as servers.

       <b>--reverse</b> Matches to be client instead of server.  This option may appear up to 1 times.

       Normally the <b>--mac</b>, <b>--regex</b> and <b>--cidr</b> flags specify are used to specify the servers and non-IP packets
       are classified as clients.  By using <b>--reverse</b>, these features are reversed so that the flags specify
       clients and non-IP packets are classified as servers.

       <b>-C</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--comment</b>=<u>string</u> Embedded cache file comment.  This option may appear up to 1 times.

       Specify a comment to be imbedded within the output cache file and later viewed.

       <b>--no-arg-comment</b> Do not embed any cache file comment.  This option may appear up to 1 times.

       By default, tcpprep includes the arguments passed on the command line in the cache file comment (in
       addition to any user specified --comment).  If for some reason you do not wish to include this, specify
       this option.

       <b>-x</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--include</b>=<u>string</u> Include only packets matching rule.  This option may appear up to 1 times.
       This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options: exclude.

       Override default of processing all packets stored in the capture file and only send/edit packets which
       match the provided rule.  Rules can be one of:

       <u>S:&lt;CIDR1&gt;,...</u>  - Source IP must match specified IPv4/v6 CIDR(s)

       <u>D:&lt;CIDR1&gt;,...</u>  - Destination IP must match specified IPv4/v6 CIDR(s)

       <u>B:&lt;CIDR1&gt;,...</u>  - Both source and destination IP must match specified IPv4/v6 CIDR(s)

       <u>E:&lt;CIDR1&gt;,...</u>  - Either IP must match specified IPv4/v6 CIDR(s)

       <u>P:&lt;LIST&gt;</u> - Must be one of the listed packets where the list corresponds to the packet number in the
       capture file.
           -x P:1-5,9,15,72-
       would process packets 1 through 5, the 9th and 15th packet, and packets 72 until the end of the file

       <u>F:'&lt;bpf&gt;'</u> - BPF filter.  See the <u><a href="../man8/tcpdump.8.html">tcpdump</a>(8)</u> man page for syntax.

       <b>-X</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--exclude</b>=<u>string</u> Exclude any packet matching this rule.  This option may appear up to 1 times.
       This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options: include.

       Override default of processing all packets stored in the capture file and only send/edit packets which do
       NOT match the provided rule.  Rules can be one of:

       <u>S:&lt;CIDR1&gt;,...</u>  - Source IP must not match specified IPv4/v6 CIDR(s)

       <u>D:&lt;CIDR1&gt;,...</u>  - Destination IP must not match specified IPv4/v6 CIDR(s)

       <u>B:&lt;CIDR1&gt;,...</u>  - Both source and destination IP must not match specified IPv4/v6 CIDR(s)

       <u>E:&lt;CIDR1&gt;,...</u>  - Either IP must not match specified IPv4/v6 CIDR(s)

       <u>P:&lt;LIST&gt;</u> - Must not be one of the listed packets where the list corresponds to the packet number in the
       capture file.
           -x P:1-5,9,15,72-
       would skip packets 1 through 5, the 9th and 15th packet, and packets 72 until the end of the file

       <b>-o</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--cachefile</b>=<u>string</u> Output cache file.  This option may appear up to 1 times.

       <b>-i</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--pcap</b>=<u>string</u> Input pcap file to process.  This option may appear up to 1 times.

       <b>-P</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--print-comment</b>=<u>string</u> Print embedded comment in the specified cache file.  This option may
       appear up to 1 times.

       <b>-I</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--print-info</b>=<u>string</u> Print basic info from the specified cache file.  This option may appear up
       to 1 times.

       <b>-S</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--print-stats</b>=<u>string</u> Print statistical information about the specified cache file.  This
       option may appear up to 1 times.

       <b>-s</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--services</b>=<u>string</u> Load services file for server ports.  This option may appear up to 1 times.
       This option must appear in combination with the following options: port.

       Uses a list of ports used by servers in the same format as of <a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a>: &lt;service_name&gt;
       &lt;port&gt;/&lt;protocol&gt; # comment

       Example: http            80/tcp

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--nonip</b> Send non-IP traffic out server interface.  This option may appear up to 1 times.

       By default, non-IP traffic which can not be classified as client or server is classified as "client".
       Specifying <b>--nonip</b> will reclassify non-IP traffic as "server".  Note that the meaning of this flag is
       reversed if <b>--reverse</b> is used.

       <b>-R</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--ratio</b>=<u>string</u> Ratio of client to server packets.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This
       option must appear in combination with the following options: auto.  The default <u>string</u> for this option
       is:
            2.0

       Since a given host may have both client and server traffic being sent to/from it, tcpprep uses a ratio to
       weigh these packets.  If you would like to override the default of 2:1 server to client packets required
       for a host to be classified as a server, specify it as a floating point value.

       <b>-m</b> <u>number</u>, <b>--minmask</b>=<u>number</u> Minimum network mask length in auto mode.  This option may appear up to 1
       times.  This option must appear in combination with the following options: auto.  This option takes an
       integer number as its argument.  The value of <u>number</u> is constrained to being:
           in the range  0 through 32
       The default <u>number</u> for this option is:
            30

       By default, auto modes use a minimum network mask length of 30 bits to build networks containing clients
       and servers.  This allows you to override this value.  Larger values will increase performance but may
       provide inaccurate results.

       <b>-M</b> <u>number</u>, <b>--maxmask</b>=<u>number</u> Maximum network mask length in auto mode.  This option may appear up to 1
       times.  This option must appear in combination with the following options: auto.  This option takes an
       integer number as its argument.  The value of <u>number</u> is constrained to being:
           in the range  0 through 32
       The default <u>number</u> for this option is:
            8

       By default, auto modes use a maximum network mask length of 8 bits to build networks containing clients
       and servers.  This allows you to override this value.  Larger values will decrease performance and
       accuracy but will provide greater chance of success.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b> Print decoded packets via tcpdump to STDOUT.  This option may appear up to 1 times.

       <b>-A</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--decode</b>=<u>string</u> Arguments passed to tcpdump decoder.  This option may appear up to 1 times.
       This option must appear in combination with the following options: verbose.

       When enabling verbose mode (<b>-v</b>) you may also specify one or more additional arguments to pass to <b>tcpdump</b>
       to modify the way packets are decoded.  By default, -n and -l are used.  Be sure to quote the arguments
       so that they are not interpreted by tcprewrite.  The following arguments are valid:
           [ -aAeNqRStuvxX ]
           [ -E spi@ipaddr algo:secret,... ]
           [ -s snaplen ]

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b> Print version information.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--less-help</b> Display less usage information and exit.

       This option has not been fully documented.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--suppress-warnings</b> suppress printing warning messages.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--help</b> Display usage information and exit.

       <b>-!</b>, <b>--more-help</b> Pass the extended usage information through a pager.

       <b>--save-opts</b> [=<u>cfgfile</u>] Save the option state to <u>cfgfile</u>.  The default is the <u>last</u> configuration file
       listed in the <b>OPTION</b> <b>PRESETS</b> section, below.  The command will exit after updating the config file.

       <b>--load-opts</b>=<u>cfgfile</u>, <b>--no-load-opts</b> Load options from <u>cfgfile</u>.  The <u>no-load-opts</u> form will disable the
       loading of earlier config/rc/ini files.  <u>--no-load-opts</u> is handled early, out of order.

       <b>OPTION</b> <b>PRESETS</b>
              Any option that  is  not  marked  as  <u>not</u>  <u>presettable</u>  may  be  preset  by  loading  values  from
              configuration ("RC" or ".INI") file(s).  The <u>homerc</u> file is "<u>$$/</u>", unless that is a directory.  In
              that case, the file "<u>.tcppreprc</u>" is searched for within that directory.
