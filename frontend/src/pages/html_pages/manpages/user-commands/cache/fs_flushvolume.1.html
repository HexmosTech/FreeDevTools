</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fs_flushvolume - Forces the Cache Manager to discard cached data from a volume

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fs</b> <b>flushvolume</b> [<b>-path</b> &lt;<u>dir/file</u> <u>path</u>&gt;+] [<b>-help</b>]

       <b>fs</b> <b>flushv</b> [<b>-p</b> &lt;<u>dir/file</u> <u>path</u>&gt;+] [<b>-h</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>fs</b> <b>flushvolume</b> command removes from the cache all data that was fetched from the same volume as each
       specified directory or file.  It does not discard cached status information. The next time an application
       requests data from a flushed directory or file, the Cache Manager fetches the most current version from a
       File Server, along with a new callback (if necessary) and associated status information. This command has
       no effect on two types of data:

       •   Data in application program buffers.

       •   Data  that  has  been changed locally and written to the cache but not yet written to the copy on the
           file server machine.

       To discard the data and status information associated with individual files and directories, use  the  <b>fs</b>
       <b>flush</b> command. To flush a corrupted mount point, use the <b>fs</b> <b>flushmount</b> command.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-path</b> &lt;<u>dir/file</u> <u>path</u>&gt;+
           Names  a  file  or directory from each volume for which to discard all cached data. Partial pathnames
           are interpreted relative to the current working directory, which is also the default  value  if  this
           argument is omitted.

       <b>-help</b>
           Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  command flushes from the cache all data fetched from the volume that contains the current
       working directory:

          % fs flushvolume

</pre><h4><b>PRIVILEGE</b> <b>REQUIRED</b></h4><pre>
       The issuer must have the "l" (lookup) permission on the ACL of the root  directory  of  the  volume  that
       houses  the file or directory named by the <b>-path</b> argument, and on the ACL of each directory that precedes
       it in the pathname.
