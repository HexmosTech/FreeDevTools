       fs_bypassthreshold - get/set Cache Bypass file size threshold

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fs</b> <b>bypassthreshold</b> [<b>-size</b> &lt;<u>file</u> <u>size</u>&gt;] [<b>-help</b>]

       <b>fs</b> <b>bypassthresh</b> [<b>-s</b> &lt;<u>file</u> <u>size</u>&gt;] [<b>-h</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>fs</b> <b>bypassthreshold</b> command either changes the AFS client Cache Bypass file size threshold, or reports
       the current threshold. Normally, when an application tries to read data via the OpenAFS client, the
       client will fetch the required data from the fileserver, store the results in the local cache, and then
       serve the application request from the local cache. When the Cache Bypass feature is enabled, certain
       files will be read directly from the network, and the data will not be saved to the local cache. In some
       scenarios, this can provide a significant performance improvement, especially if the data is only read
       once.

       Currently, the only way to specify which files should bypass the cache and which files should not, is by
       file size. In the future, different mechanisms may exist for specifying which files should bypass the
       local cache and which should not.

       If <b>-size</b> is not specified, <b>fs</b> <b>bypassthreshold</b> just reports the current threshold and exits.

</pre><h4><b>CAUTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Cache Bypass is still considered an experimental feature. Even in stable releases of OpenAFS, it is not
       considered as stable as the rest of OpenAFS.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-size</b> &lt;<u>file</u> <u>size</u>&gt;
           Specifies  how  large  a file must be in order to enable Cache Bypass mode.  If a file is larger than
           the specified file size (in bytes), reading from that file will bypass the local cache  and  be  read
           directly from the network. A file size of -1 indicates that Cache Bypass should be disabled complete,
           so no files will enable Cache Bypass mode, no matter how large they are.

           By default, Cache Bypass is disabled.

       <b>-help</b>
           Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       The  output  format  is  identical  whether or not <b>-size</b> was specified. If <b>-size</b> is specified, the bypass
       threshold is changed, and the output  represents  the  new,  changed,  threshold.  Otherwise  the  output
       represents the current threshold.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following example turns on Cache Bypass with a threshold of 4KiB:

          % fs bypassthreshold 4096
          Cache bypass threshold 4096

       The following example disables Cache Bypass:

          % fs bypassthreshold -1
          Cache bypass threshold -1 (disabled)

       The following example examines the current Cache Bypass threshold:

          % fs bypassthreshold
          Cache bypass threshold 4096

</pre><h4><b>PRIVILEGE</b> <b>REQUIRED</b></h4><pre>
       To  set  the  bypass threshold, the issuer must be logged in as the local superuser "root". Otherwise, no
       privilege is required.
