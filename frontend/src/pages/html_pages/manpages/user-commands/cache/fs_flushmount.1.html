</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fs_flushmount - Forces the Cache Manager to discard a mount point

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fs</b> <b>flushmount</b> [<b>-path</b> &lt;<u>dir/file</u> <u>path</u>&gt;+] [<b>-help</b>]

       <b>fs</b> <b>flushm</b> [<b>-p</b> &lt;<u>dir/file</u> <u>path</u>&gt;+] [<b>-h</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>fs</b> <b>flushmount</b> command removes from the cache all information associated with each mount point named
       by the <b>-path</b> argument. The next time an application accesses the mount point, the Cache Manager fetches
       the most current version of it from the File Server. Data cached from the associated volume is not
       affected.

       The command's intended use is to discard information about mount points that has become corrupted in the
       cache. (The Cache Manager periodically refreshes cached mount points, but the only other way to discard
       them immediately is to reinitialize the Cache Manager by rebooting the machine.) Symptoms of a corrupted
       mount point included garbled output from the <b>fs</b> <b>lsmount</b> command, and failed attempts to change directory
       to or list the contents of a mount point.

       To flush cached data rather than a mount point, use the <b>fs</b> <b>flush</b> or <b>fs</b> <b>flushvolume</b> command.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-path</b> &lt;<u>dir/file</u> <u>path</u>&gt;+
           Names  each  mount  point  to flush from the cache. Partial pathnames are interpreted relative to the
           current working directory, which is also the default value if this argument is omitted.

       <b>-help</b>
           Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following command flushes from the cache the mount point for user "pat"'s home directory:

          % fs flushm /afs/example.com/usr/pat

</pre><h4><b>PRIVILEGE</b> <b>REQUIRED</b></h4><pre>
       The issuer must have the "l" (lookup) permission on the ACL of the root  directory  of  the  volume  that
       houses  the file or directory named by the <b>-path</b> argument, and on the ACL of each directory that precedes
       it in the pathname.
