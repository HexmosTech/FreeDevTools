       nbdkit-cache-filter - nbdkit caching filter

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        nbdkit --filter=cache plugin [plugin-args...]
                                     [cache=writeback|writethrough|unsafe]
                                     [cache-min-block-size=SIZE]
                                     [cache-max-size=SIZE]
                                     [cache-high-threshold=N]
                                     [cache-low-threshold=N]
                                     [cache-on-read=true|false|/PATH]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "nbdkit-cache-filter" is a filter that adds caching on top of a plugin.

       This is useful if a plugin is slow or expensive to use, because nbdkit will try to minimize requests to
       the plugin by caching previous requests.  You should use "cache-on-read=true" (not the default) to cache
       reads from slow plugins.

       Note that many NBD <u>clients</u> are able to do caching, and because the caching happens on the client side it
       will usually be more effective than caching inside the server.  This filter can be used if the client
       does not have effective caching, or (with "cache=unsafe") to defeat flush requests from the client (which
       is unsafe and can cause data loss, as the name suggests).

       This filter only caches image contents.  To cache image metadata, use <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-cacheextents-filter.1.html">nbdkit-cacheextents-filter</a></b>(1)
       between this filter and the plugin.  To accelerate sequential reads, use <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-readahead-filter.1.html">nbdkit-readahead-filter</a></b>(1) or
       <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-scan-filter.1.html">nbdkit-scan-filter</a></b>(1) on top of this filter.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cache=writeback</b>
           Store  writes  in  the cache.  They are not written to the plugin unless an explicit flush is done by
           the client.

           This is the default caching mode, and is safe if your client issues flush requests  correctly  (which
           is true for modern Linux and other well-written NBD clients).

       <b>cache=writethrough</b>
           Always force writes through to the plugin.

           This  makes  the  cache  less effective, but is necessary if your client does not issue correct flush
           requests.

       <b>cache=unsafe</b>
           Ignore flush requests.  Never write to the plugin unless the cache grows too large.

           This is dangerous and can cause data loss, but this may be acceptable if you only use it for  testing
           or with data that you don't care about or can cheaply reconstruct.

       <b>cache-min-block-size=</b>SIZE
           Set the minimum block size used by the cache.  This must be a power of 2 and ≥ 4096.

           The default is 64K, or the block size of the filesystem which contains the temporary file storing the
           cache (whichever is larger).

       <b>cache-max-size=</b>SIZE
       <b>cache-high-threshold=</b>N
       <b>cache-low-threshold=</b>N
           (nbdkit ≥ 1.10)

           Limit the size of the cache to "SIZE".  See "CACHE MAXIMUM SIZE" below.

       <b>cache-on-read=true</b>
           (nbdkit ≥ 1.10)

           Cache  read  requests as well as write and cache requests.  Any time a block is read from the plugin,
           it is saved in the cache (if there is sufficient space) so the same data can be served  more  quickly
           later.

           Note  that  if  the  underlying  data  served  by the plugin can be modified by some other means (eg.
           something else can write to a file which is being served by <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-file-plugin.1.html">nbdkit-file-plugin</a></b>(1)), this option  will
           cause nbdkit to serve stale data because reads won't always go through to the plugin.

       <b>cache-on-read=false</b>
           Do not cache read requests (this is the default).

       <b>cache-on-read=/PATH</b>
           (nbdkit ≥ 1.28)

           When  <u>/PATH</u> (which must be an absolute path) exists, this behaves like "cache-on-read=true", and when
           it does not exist like "cache-on-read=false".  This allows you to control the cache-on-read behaviour
           while nbdkit is running.

</pre><h4><b>CACHE</b> <b>MAXIMUM</b> <b>SIZE</b></h4><pre>
       By default the cache can grow to any size (although not larger than the virtual size  of  the  underlying
       plugin) and you have to ensure there is sufficient space in $TMPDIR for it.

       Using the parameters "cache-max-size", "cache-high-threshold" and "cache-low-threshold" you can limit the
       maximum size of the cache.

       This requires kernel and filesystem support (for <b><a href="../man2/fallocate.2.html">fallocate</a></b>(2) "FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE"), so it may not work
       on all platforms.

       Some examples:

       "cache-max-size=1G"
           The cache is limited to around 1 gigabyte.

       "cache-max-size=1G cache-high-threshold=95 cache-low-threshold=80"
           Once  the  cache size reaches 972M (95% of 1G), blocks are reclaimed from the cache until the size is
           reduced to 819M (80% of 1G).

       The way this works is once the size of the cache exceeds "SIZE" ✕ the high threshold, the filter works to
       reduce the size of the cache until it is less than "SIZE" ✕ the low threshold.  Once the  size  is  below
       the low threshold, no more reclaim work is done until the size exceeds the high threshold again.

       The  default  thresholds  are  high  95%  and  low 80%.  You must set 0 &lt; low &lt; high.  The thresholds are
       expressed as integer percentages of "cache-max-size".

       Least recently used blocks are discarded first.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       "TMPDIR"
           The cache is stored in a temporary file located in  <u><a href="file:/var/tmp">/var/tmp</a></u>  by  default.   You  can  override  this
           location by setting the "TMPDIR" environment variable before starting nbdkit.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>$filterdir/nbdkit-cache-filter.so</u>
           The filter.

           Use "nbdkit --dump-config" to find the location of $filterdir.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       "nbdkit-cache-filter" first appeared in nbdkit 1.2.
