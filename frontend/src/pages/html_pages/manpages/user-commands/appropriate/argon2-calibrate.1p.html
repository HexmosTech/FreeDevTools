</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       argon2-calibrate - a script to find the appropriate argon2 parameters

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.029

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program implements the following procedure, as recommended by the argon2 authors:

       1. Select the type "y". If you do not know the difference between them, choose Argon2id.
       2. Figure out the maximum number of threads "h" that can be initiated by each call to Argon2. This is the
       "parallelism" argument.
       3. Figure out the maximum amount of memory  "m" that each call can a afford.
       4. Figure out the maximum amount "x" of time (in seconds) that each call can a afford.
       5. Select the salt length. 16 bytes is suffient for all applications, but can be reduced to 8 bytes in
       the case of space constraints.
       6. Select the tag (output) size. 16 bytes is suffient for most applications, including key derivation.
       7. Run the scheme of type "y", memory "m" and "h" lanes and threads, using different number of passes
       "t". Figure out the maximum "t" such that the running time does not exceed "x". If it exceeds "x" even
       for "t = 1", reduce "m" accordingly. If using Argon2i, t must be at least 3.
       8. Hash all the passwords with the just determined values "m", "h", and "t".
