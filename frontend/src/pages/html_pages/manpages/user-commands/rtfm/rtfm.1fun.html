</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       rtfm - a response for easy questions from clueless lusers

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rtfm</b> <b>[</b> <b>-p</b> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <b>-h</b> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <b>-d</b> <b>option</b> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <b>-i</b> <b>interval</b> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <b>-a</b> <b>action</b> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <b>-q</b> <b>luser]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rtfm</b> is a command for system administrators to use in dealing with new users.  <b>rtfm</b> is useful for dealing
       with  users  having trouble with their pictures downloaded from alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.  <b>rtfm</b> will
       continue to run until killed by hand, using `kill processid'.  <b>rtfm</b> can be  invoked  by  anyone  who  has
       enough of a clue to know what a man page is.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-p</b>     Give the answer in a polite fashion.

       <b>-h</b>     Tell the clueless luser to go to hell. Used with the -p option, they'll look forward to the trip.

       <b>-d</b> <b>option</b>
              Debug mode using option where option is one of the following:

              <u>query</u> Ask the luser what part of rtfm that he or she does not understand.

              <u>planet</u> Ask what planet the luser is from.

              <u>literacy</u> Ask the luser if the luser can read.

              <u>english</u> Ask the luser if the luser understands English.

              <u>Mac</u> Ask the luser if the luser has ever used a computer other than a Macintosh.

              <u>Nintendo</u> Same as the Mac option, but slightly more harsh.

       <b>-i</b> <b>interval</b>
              Enable  within  interval  seconds.  interval is the time between a luser asking the same damn fool
              question.  This option must be activated for the <b>-a</b> option. It stores the time of the question  in
              <b>/var/run/luser</b>  and  checks  that  file each time that rtfm is activated.  interval is a number of
              minutes, of the form xxx.xx where each x is a decimal digit. The default is 5.00 minutes.

       <b>-a</b> <b>action</b>
              This defines some action to be taken in the event that the <b>-i</b> flag condition is met. action can be
              defined either at the flag level or by a file. The options for flags are as follows:

              <u>scream</u> Let out a scream of utter frustration.

              <u>hair</u> Rip out your hair in total frustration.

              <u>rm</u> Automatic command ran in lusers home directory. It can have an addition <b>-rf</b> flag added.

              <u>ignore</u> Ignore the luser.

              <u>warn</u> Warn the other sysadmins.

              <u>forward</u> Forward to CNS advising. Particullary if the complaint is /dev/null is full.

              <u>kill</u> Kill all the lusers processes.

              <u>FILE=file.name</u> Use a file to define a course of actions. This can be any  executable  file  except
              those  using  ksh,  which  no god-fearing right-thinking sysadmin would be caught using lest he be
              struck down by the wrath of God.

       <b>-q</b> <b>luser</b>
              Query file <b>/etc/luser</b> to see if luser is a real luser or a first time luser.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/etc/luser</b>

       <u><a href="../man2/mr.biff.2.html">mr.biff</a></u>(2),

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rtfm</b> only checks <b>/var/run/luser</b> when the <b>-a</b> option is specified and  after  the  <b>-i</b>  option  is  invoked.
       Otherwise  <b><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></b>  would  fill  up  rapidly  on many systems. Also, core may dump if the <b>-a</b> <b>FILE=</b> option is
       anatomically impossible.
