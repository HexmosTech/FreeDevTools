</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       check-support-status - check installed packages for security support (debian-security-support)

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version 1:13+2025.01.30

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Search for packages whose support is limited, has already ended or will end earlier than the
       distribution’s end of life:

           check-support-status

       Search for packages with ended support from a custom list, reporting each package only once:

           check-support-status \
               --type ended \
               --status-db /path/to/status-db \
               --list /path/to/security-support-ended

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--list</b> <u>FILE</u>
           Use the given file as the database of packages whose support ends at a particular date or that is
           limited by specific conditions. The file format is plain text in columns, separated by one or more
           whitespace characters.

           For --type earlyend:

           •   source package name

           •   last package version that will be supported

           •   the date support will end

           •   the rest (optional): details, and/or a URL for further information.

           For --type ended:

           •   source package name

           •   last package version that is supported

           •   the date support was ended

           •   the rest (optional): details, and/or a URL for further information.

           For --type limited:

           •   source package name

           •   the rest (optional): details, and/or a URL for further information.

           If no "--list" is provided, the script is run for limited and date-defined end of support, using the
           lists shipped in the package.

           By default, check-support-status evaluates the status of the packages according to the Debian version
           where it runs upon. This behavior can be modified using the DEBIAN_VERSION environment variable, e.g.

               DEBIAN_VERSION=9 check-support-status

       <b>--no-heading</b>
           Skips printing a headline.

       <b>--status-db</b> <u>FILE</u>
           Use the given file to record alerts so each affected package is reported only once.

           Default: No records, any affected package will be reported every time.

       <b>--except</b> <u>PACKAGES</u>
           Do not alert for the given binary packages (comma-separated list).

           Default: Alert for all packages (no exceptions).

       <b>--type</b> <u>TYPE</u>
           One of the following:

           •   "earlyend": Alert for packages whose support will end earlier than the distribution’s.

           •   "ended": Alert for packages where security support has ended.

           •   "limited": Alert for packages where security support is limited.

       <b>--version,</b> <b>--Version,</b> <b>-V</b>
           Show the version number and exit.
