   <b>manufacturer</b>
       Set/Get advertise manufacturer data.

       Updating  is  in  real  time  while advertising. This is currently limited to 25 bytes and will return an
       error message of "Too much data" if that maximum has been exceeded. However, this does not check  if  the
       advertising payload length maximum has been exceeded so you  may receive an error from bluetoothd that it
       "Failed to register advertisement" which means you need to reduce your manufacturer data length.

       <b>Usage</b>  <b>#</b> <b>manufacturer</b> <b>[id]</b> <b>[data=xx</b> <b>xx</b> <b>...]</b>

   <b>data</b>
       Set/Get advertise data.

       This allows you to advertise data with a given type. You cannot use a registered data type value {1} with
       this command. For LE the advertising shows up in the primary advertisements.

       If  you  set  only  the  type of the data without any data (data 0x0c) this will cause a parse error when
       turning advertise on.

       You can modify the advertising data while it is advertising.

       To get the currently set data use the command data without any arguments.

       <b>Usage</b>  <b>#</b> <b>data</b> <b>[type]</b> <b>[data=xx</b> <b>xx</b> <b>...]</b>

       <b>Example</b>

       For LE discoverable on  will  set  the  LE  General  Discoverable  Mode  flag  to  true  in  the  primary
       advertisement if on.

       This  feature  can be changed during advertising, but will only trigger LE General Discoverable Mode even
       if you had previously selected discoverable-timeout this will be ignored.

       Entering the command by itself will show the status of the setting

       <b>Usage</b>  <b>#</b> <b>discoverable</b> <b>[on/off]</b>

   <b>discoverable-timeout</b>
       Set/Get advertise discoverable timeout.

       Using this feature in LE will cause the LE Limited Discoverable Mode  flag  to  be  set  in  the  primary
       advertisement and   The LE General Discoverable Mode flag will not be set.

       The  LE Limited Discoverable Mode flag will automatically turn off after [seconds] discoverable [on] must
       be set to use this feature.

       Entering the command by itself will show the current value set.

       <b>Usage</b>  <b>#</b> <b>discoverable-timeout</b> <b>[seconds]</b>

   <b>tx-power</b>
       Show/Enable/Disable TX power to be advertised.

       This sets the TX Power Level field in the advertising packet.

       The value is in dBm and can be between -127 and 127.

       When this feature is turned  on  the  LE  device  will  advertise  its  transmit  power  in  the  primary
       advertisement.

       This feature can be modified while advertising.

       Entering the command by itself will show the current value set.

       <b>Usage</b>  <b>#</b> <b>tx-power</b> <b>[on/off]</b> <b>[power]</b>

   <b>name</b>
       Configure local name to be advertised.

       Local name to be used in the advertising report.

       If the string is too big to fit into the packet it will be truncated.

       It  will  either  advertise  as a complete local name or if it has to be truncated then a shortened local
       name.

       <b>Usage</b>  <b>#</b> <b>name</b> <b>[on/off/name]</b>

       <b>Example</b>
              <b>#</b> <b>name</b> <b>"0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef"</b>

   <b>appearance</b>

       <b>Usage</b>  <b>#</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>[on/off/value]</b>

   <b>duration</b>
       Set/Get advertise duration.

       The Duration parameter configures the length of an Instance.

       The value is in seconds.

       A value of 0 indicates a default value is chosen for the Duration.

       The default is 2 seconds.

       If only one advertising Instance has been added, then the Duration value will be ignored.

       If multiple advertising Instances have been added, then the Duration value will be used to determine  the
       length of time each Instance is advertised for.

       The  Duration  value is used to calculate the number of advertising events that will be used to advertise
       each Instance.

       The number of advertising events is  calculated  by  dividing  the  Duration  value  by  the  advertising
       interval.

       The  advertising interval is determined by the advertising parameters that are set for each Instance. The
       advertising interval is the maximum of the advertising intervals set for each Instance.

       <b>Usage</b>  <b>#</b> <b>duration</b> <b>[seconds]</b>

   <b>timeout</b>
       Set/Get advertise timeout.

       <b>Usage</b>  <b>#</b> <b>timeout</b> <b>[seconds]</b>

   <b>secondary</b>

       <b>Usage</b>  <b>#</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>[1M/2M/Coded]</b>

   <b>interval</b>
       Set/Get advertise interval.

       The Interval parameter configures the advertising interval of an Instance.

       The value is in milliseconds.

       A value of 0 indicates a default value is chosen for the Interval.

       The default is 100 milliseconds.

       The Interval value is used to calculate the number of advertising events that will be used  to  advertise
       each Instance.

       The  number  of  advertising  events  is  calculated  by  dividing  the Duration value by the advertising
       interval.

       The advertising interval is determined by the advertising parameters that are set for each Instance.

       The advertising interval is the maximum of the advertising intervals set for each Instance.

       <b>Usage</b>  <b>#</b> <b>interval</b> <b>[milliseconds]</b>

   <b>clear</b>
       Clear advertise config.

       This will stop advertising if it is currently advertising.

       If you want to change the advertise configuration while advertising you must first  clear  the  advertise
       configuration and then set the new advertise configuration.

       <b>Usage</b>  <b>#</b> <b>clear</b> <b>[uuids/service/manufacturer/config-name...]</b>
