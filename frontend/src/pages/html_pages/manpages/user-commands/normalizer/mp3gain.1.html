</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mp3gain — lossless mp3 normalizer

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mp3gain</b> [<b>options</b>]  [<u>infile</u>]  [<u>infile</u> <u>2</u> ...<u>]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the <b>mp3gain</b>       command.

       This  manual  page  was  written for the <b>Debian</b> distribution because the original program does not have a
       manual page.

       <b>mp3gain</b> can analyze and adjust mp3 files so that they have the same volume.

       <b>mp3gain</b> does not just do peak normalization, as many normalizers do. Instead, it  does  some  statistical
       analysis to determine how loud the file actually sounds to the human ear. Also, the changes <b>mp3gain</b> makes
       are  completely lossless. There is no quality lost in the change because the program adjusts the mp3 file
       directly, without decoding and re-encoding.

       <b>mp3gain</b> optionally writes gain adjustments directly into the encoded data. In this case,  the  adjustment
       works with all mp3 players, i.e. no support for a special tag is required.  This mode is activated by any
       of the options <b>-r</b>, <b>-a</b>, <b>-g</b>, or <b>-l</b>.

       If  none  of the above options are given, the recommended gain change is instead written to a special tag
       in the mp3 file. In this case, the adjustment only works with mp3 players that support  this  tag.   Some
       mp3 players refer to this as ReplayGain.  The tag is written either in APEv2 format (default) or in ID3v2
       format  (with  <b>-s</b> <b>i</b>).   If you only want to print the recommended gain change (and not modify the file at
       all) you may use the <b>-s</b> <b>s</b> (skip tag) option.

       The method mp3gain uses to determine the desired volume is described at <u>www.replaygain.org</u> <u>(link</u>  <u>to</u>  <u>URL</u>
       <u><a href="http://www.replaygain.org/">http://www.replaygain.org/</a>)</u> .  See also <b>/usr/share/doc/mp3gain/README.method</b> .

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-?</b>           <b>-h</b>
                 Show summary of options.

       <b>-g</b> <u>i</u>      apply gain <u>i</u> to mp3 without doing any analysis

       <b>-l</b> <b>0</b> <u>i</u>    apply  gain  <u>i</u>  to  channel  0 (left channel) of mp3 without doing any analysis (ONLY works for
                 STEREO mp3s, not Joint Stereo mp3s)

       <b>-l</b> <b>1</b> <u>i</u>    apply gain <u>i</u> to channel 1 (right channel) of mp3 without doing any  analysis  (ONLY  works  for
                 STEREO mp3s, not Joint Stereo mp3s)

       <b>-r</b>        apply Track gain automatically (all files set to equal loudness)

       <b>-k</b>        automatically lower Track gain to not clip audio

       <b>-a</b>        apply  Album  gain  automatically  (files  are all from the same album: a single gain change is
                 applied to all files, so their loudness relative to  each  other  remains  unchanged,  but  the
                 average album loudness is normalized)

       <b>-m</b> <u>i</u>      modify suggested MP3 gain by integer <u>i</u>

       <b>-d</b> <u>n</u>      modify suggested dB gain by floating-point <u>n</u>

       <b>-c</b>        ignore clipping warning when applying gain

       <b>-o</b>        output is a database-friendly tab-delimited list

       <b>-t</b>        mp3gain  writes  modified mp3 to temp file, then deletes original instead of modifying bytes in
                 original file (This is the default in Debian)

       <b>-T</b>        mp3gain modifies bytes in original file instead of writing to temp file.

       <b>-q</b>        Quiet mode: no status messages

       <b>-p</b>        Preserve original file timestamp

       <b>-x</b>        Only find max. amplitude of mp3

       <b>-f</b>        Force <b>mp3gain</b> to assume input file is an MPEG 2 Layer III file (i.e. don't check for  mis-named
                 Layer I or Layer II files)

       <b>-s</b> <b>c</b>      only check stored tag info (no other processing)

       <b>-s</b> <b>d</b>      delete stored tag info (no other processing)

       <b>-s</b> <b>i</b>      use  ID3v2  tag  for  gain  information; if the file contained gain data in APEv2 format, it is
                 upgraded to ID3v2

       <b>-s</b> <b>a</b>      use APEv2 tag for gain information (default)

       <b>-s</b> <b>s</b>      skip (ignore) stored tag info (do not read or write tags)

       <b>-s</b> <b>r</b>      force re-calculation (do not read tag info)

       <b>-u</b>        undo changes made by mp3gain (based on stored tag info)

       <b>-w</b>        "wrap" gain change if gain+change &gt; 255 or gain+change &lt; 0 (see below or use <b>-?</b> <b>wrap</b> switch for
                 a complete explanation)

       <b>-v</b>        Show version of program.

       If you specify <b>-r</b> and <b>-a</b>, only the second one will work.

       If you do not specify <b>-c</b>, the program will stop and ask before applying gain change to a file that  might
       clip

   <b>The</b> <b>WRAP</b> <b>option</b>
       Here's  the  problem:  The  "global gain" field that mp3gain adjusts is an 8-bit unsigned integer, so the
       possible values are 0 to 255.

       MOST mp3 files (in fact, ALL the mp3 files I've examined so far) don't go over 230. So there's plenty  of
       headroom on top-- you can increase the gain by 37dB (multiplying the amplitude by 76) without a problem.

       The  problem  is  at  the  bottom of the range. Some encoders create frames with 0 as the global gain for
       silent frames.  What happens when you _lower_ the global gain by 1?  Well, in the  past,  mp3gain  always
       simply  wrapped the result up to 255.  That way, if you lowered the gain by any amount and then raised it
       by the same amount, the mp3 would always be _exactly_ the same.

       There are a few encoders out there, unfortunately, that create 0-gain frames with other audio data in the
       frame.  As long as the global gain is 0, you'll never hear the data.  But if you lower the gain on such a
       file, the global gain is suddenly _huge_.  If you play this modified file, there might be a  brief,  very
       loud blip.

       So now the default behavior of mp3gain is to _not_ wrap gain changes.  In other words,

          1. If the gain change would make a frame's global gain drop below 0, then the global gain is set to 0.

          2. If  the gain change would make a frame's global gain grow above 255, then the global gain is set to
             255.

          3.

             If a frame's global gain field is already 0, it is not changed,  even  if  the  gain  change  is  a
             positive number.

       To use the original "wrapping" behavior, use the <b>-w</b> switch.
