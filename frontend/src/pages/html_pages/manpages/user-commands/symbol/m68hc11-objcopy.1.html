</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The GNU <b>objcopy</b> utility copies the contents of an object file to another.  <b>objcopy</b> uses the GNU BFD
       Library to read and write the object files.  It can write the destination object file in a format
       different from that of the source object file.  The exact behavior of <b>objcopy</b> is controlled by command-
       line options.  Note that <b>objcopy</b> should be able to copy a fully linked file between any two formats.
       However, copying a relocatable object file between any two formats may not work as expected.

       <b>objcopy</b> creates temporary files to do its translations and deletes them afterward.  <b>objcopy</b> uses BFD to
       do all its translation work; it has access to all the formats described in BFD and thus is able to
       recognize most formats without being told explicitly.

       <b>objcopy</b> can be used to generate S-records by using an output target of <b>srec</b> (e.g., use <b>-O</b> <b>srec</b>).

       <b>objcopy</b> can be used to generate a raw binary file by using an output target of <b>binary</b> (e.g., use <b>-O</b>
       <b>binary</b>).  When <b>objcopy</b> generates a raw binary file, it will essentially produce a memory dump of the
       contents of the input object file.  All symbols and relocation information will be discarded.  The memory
       dump will start at the load address of the lowest section copied into the output file.

       When generating an S-record or a raw binary file, it may be helpful to use <b>-S</b> to remove sections
       containing debugging information.  In some cases <b>-R</b> will be useful to remove sections which contain
       information that is not needed by the binary file.

       Note---<b>objcopy</b> is not able to change the endianness of its input files.  If the input format has an
       endianness (some formats do not), <b>objcopy</b> can only copy the inputs into file formats that have the same
       endianness or which have no endianness (e.g., <b>srec</b>).  (However, see the <b>--reverse-bytes</b> option.)

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>infile</u>
       <u>outfile</u>
           The input and output files, respectively.  If you do not specify <u>outfile</u>, <b>objcopy</b> creates a temporary
           file and destructively renames the result with the name of <u>infile</u>.

       <b>-I</b> <u>bfdname</u>
       <b>--input-target=</b><u>bfdname</u>
           Consider the source file's object format to be <u>bfdname</u>, rather than attempting to deduce it.

       <b>-O</b> <u>bfdname</u>
       <b>--output-target=</b><u>bfdname</u>
           Write the output file using the object format <u>bfdname</u>.

       <b>-F</b> <u>bfdname</u>
       <b>--target=</b><u>bfdname</u>
           Use  <u>bfdname</u>  as the object format for both the input and the output file; i.e., simply transfer data
           from source to destination with no translation.

       <b>-B</b> <u>bfdarch</u>
       <b>--binary-architecture=</b><u>bfdarch</u>
           Useful when transforming a architecture-less input file into an object file.  In this case the output
           architecture can be set to <u>bfdarch</u>.  This option will be ignored  if  the  input  file  has  a  known
           <u>bfdarch</u>.   You  can  access this binary data inside a program by referencing the special symbols that
           are  created  by  the  conversion  process.   These   symbols   are   called   _binary_<u>objfile</u>_start,
           _binary_<u>objfile</u>_end  and  _binary_<u>objfile</u>_size.  e.g. you can transform a picture file into an object
           file and then access it in your code using these symbols.

       <b>-j</b> <u>sectionpattern</u>
       <b>--only-section=</b><u>sectionpattern</u>
           Copy only the indicated sections from the input file to the output file.  This option  may  be  given
           more  than  once.   Note  that  using  this option inappropriately may make the output file unusable.
           Wildcard characters are accepted in <u>sectionpattern</u>.

           If the first character of <u>sectionpattern</u> is the exclamation point (!) then matching sections will not
           be copied, even if earlier use of <b>--only-section</b> on the same command line would  otherwise  copy  it.
           For example:

                     --only-section=.text.* --only-section=!.text.foo

           will copy all sectinos matching '.text.*' but not the section '.text.foo'.

       <b>-R</b> <u>sectionpattern</u>
       <b>--remove-section=</b><u>sectionpattern</u>
           Remove  any section matching <u>sectionpattern</u> from the output file.  This option may be given more than
           once.  Note that using this option inappropriately may  make  the  output  file  unusable.   Wildcard
           characters  are  accepted  in  <u>sectionpattern</u>.   Using both the <b>-j</b> and <b>-R</b> options together results in
           undefined behaviour.

           If the first character of <u>sectionpattern</u> is the exclamation point (!) then matching sections will not
           be removed even if an earlier use of <b>--remove-section</b> on the same command line would otherwise remove
           it.  For example:

                     --remove-section=.text.* --remove-section=!.text.foo

           will remove all sections matching the pattern '.text.*', but will not remove the section '.text.foo'.

       <b>--keep-section=</b><u>sectionpattern</u>
           When removing sections from the output file, keep sections that match <u>sectionpattern</u>.

       <b>--remove-relocations=</b><u>sectionpattern</u>
           Remove non-dynamic relocations from the output file for any section  matching  <u>sectionpattern</u>.   This
           option  may be given more than once.  Note that using this option inappropriately may make the output
           file unusable, and attempting to remove a dynamic  relocation  section  such  as  <b>.rela.plt</b>  from  an
           executable  or  shared library with <b>--remove-relocations=.plt</b> will not work.  Wildcard characters are
           accepted in <u>sectionpattern</u>.  For example:

                     --remove-relocations=.text.*

           will remove the relocations for all sections matching the pattern '.text.*'.

           If the first character of <u>sectionpattern</u> is the exclamation point (!) then matching sections will not
           have their relocation removed even if an earlier use of <b>--remove-relocations</b> on the same command line
           would otherwise cause the relocations to be removed.  For example:

                     --remove-relocations=.text.* --remove-relocations=!.text.foo

           will remove all relocations for  sections  matching  the  pattern  '.text.*',  but  will  not  remove
           relocations for the section '.text.foo'.

       <b>--strip-section-headers</b>
           Strip section header   This option is specific to ELF files.  Implies <b>--strip-all</b> and <b>--merge-notes</b>.

       <b>-S</b>
       <b>--strip-all</b>
           Do not copy relocation and symbol information from the source file.  Also deletes debug sections.

       <b>-g</b>
       <b>--strip-debug</b>
           Do not copy debugging symbols or sections from the source file.

       <b>--strip-unneeded</b>
           Remove all symbols that are not needed for relocation processing in addition to debugging symbols and
           sections stripped by <b>--strip-debug</b>.

       <b>-K</b> <u>symbolname</u>
       <b>--keep-symbol=</b><u>symbolname</u>
           When  stripping  symbols,  keep symbol <u>symbolname</u> even if it would normally be stripped.  This option
           may be given more than once.

       <b>-N</b> <u>symbolname</u>
       <b>--strip-symbol=</b><u>symbolname</u>
           Do not copy symbol <u>symbolname</u> from the source file.  This option may be given more than once.

       <b>--strip-unneeded-symbol=</b><u>symbolname</u>
           Do not copy symbol <u>symbolname</u> from the source file unless it is needed by a relocation.  This  option
           may be given more than once.

       <b>-G</b> <u>symbolname</u>
       <b>--keep-global-symbol=</b><u>symbolname</u>
           Keep  only  symbol <u>symbolname</u> global.  Make all other symbols local to the file, so that they are not
           visible externally.  This option may be given more than once.  Note: this option cannot  be  used  in
           conjunction with the <b>--globalize-symbol</b> or <b>--globalize-symbols</b> options.

       <b>--localize-hidden</b>
           In  an  ELF  object,  mark all symbols that have hidden or internal visibility as local.  This option
           applies on top of symbol-specific localization options such as <b>-L</b>.

       <b>-L</b> <u>symbolname</u>
       <b>--localize-symbol=</b><u>symbolname</u>
           Convert a global or weak symbol called <u>symbolname</u> into a local symbol, so  that  it  is  not  visible
           externally.  This option may be given more than once.  Note - unique symbols are not converted.

       <b>-W</b> <u>symbolname</u>
       <b>--weaken-symbol=</b><u>symbolname</u>
           Make symbol <u>symbolname</u> weak. This option may be given more than once.

       <b>--globalize-symbol=</b><u>symbolname</u>
           Give  symbol  <u>symbolname</u>  global  scoping  so  that  it is visible outside of the file in which it is
           defined.  This option may be given more than once.  Note: this option cannot be used  in  conjunction
           with the <b>-G</b> or <b>--keep-global-symbol</b> options.

       <b>-w</b>
       <b>--wildcard</b>
           Permit regular expressions in <u>symbolname</u>s used in other command line options.  The question mark (?),
           asterisk  (*),  backslash  (\)  and square brackets ([]) operators can be used anywhere in the symbol
           name.  If the first character of the symbol name is the exclamation point (!) then the sense  of  the
           switch is reversed for that symbol.  For example:

                     -w -W !foo -W fo*

           would cause objcopy to weaken all symbols that start with "fo" except for the symbol "foo".

       <b>-x</b>
       <b>--discard-all</b>
           Do not copy non-global symbols from the source file.

       <b>-X</b>
       <b>--discard-locals</b>
           Do not copy compiler-generated local symbols.  (These usually start with <b>L</b> or <b>.</b>.)

       <b>-b</b> <u>byte</u>
       <b>--byte=</b><u>byte</u>
           If interleaving has been enabled via the <b>--interleave</b> option then start the range of bytes to keep at
           the  <u>byte</u>th  byte.  <u>byte</u> can be in the range from 0 to <u>breadth</u>-1, where <u>breadth</u> is the value given by
           the <b>--interleave</b> option.

       <b>-i</b> <b>[</b><u>breadth</u><b>]</b>
       <b>--interleave[=</b><u>breadth</u><b>]</b>
           Only copy a range out of every <u>breadth</u> bytes.  (Header data is not affected).  Select which  byte  in
           the  range  begins  the  copy  with  the  <b>--byte</b>  option.   Select  the  width  of the range with the
           <b>--interleave-width</b> option.

           This option is useful for creating files to program ROM.  It is typically used with an "srec"  output
           target.  Note that <b>objcopy</b> will complain if you do not specify the <b>--byte</b> option as well.

           The  default  interleave breadth is 4, so with <b>--byte</b> set to 0, <b>objcopy</b> would copy the first byte out
           of every four bytes from the input to the output.

       <b>--interleave-width=</b><u>width</u>
           When used with the <b>--interleave</b> option, copy <u>width</u> bytes at a time.  The start of the range of  bytes
           to  be  copied  is set by the <b>--byte</b> option, and the extent of the range is set with the <b>--interleave</b>
           option.

           The default value for this option is 1.  The value of <u>width</u> plus the <u>byte</u> value  set  by  the  <b>--byte</b>
           option must not exceed the interleave breadth set by the <b>--interleave</b> option.

           This  option  can  be  used  to  create  images for two 16-bit flashes interleaved in a 32-bit bus by
           passing <b>-b</b> <b>0</b> <b>-i</b> <b>4</b> <b>--interleave-width=2</b> and <b>-b</b> <b>2</b> <b>-i</b> <b>4</b> <b>--interleave-width=2</b> to  two  <b>objcopy</b>  commands.
           If the input was '12345678' then the outputs would be '1256' and '3478' respectively.

       <b>-p</b>
       <b>--preserve-dates</b>
           Set the access and modification dates of the output file to be the same as those of the input file.

           This  option  also  copies the date stored in a PE format file's header, unless the SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH
           environment variable is defined.  If it is defined then this variable will be used as the date stored
           in the header, interpreted as the number of seconds since the Unix epoch.

       <b>-D</b>
       <b>--enable-deterministic-archives</b>
           Operate in <u>deterministic</u> mode.  When copying archive members and writing the archive index, use  zero
           for UIDs, GIDs, timestamps, and use consistent file modes for all files.

           If <u>binutils</u> was configured with <b>--enable-deterministic-archives</b>, then this mode is on by default.  It
           can be disabled with the <b>-U</b> option, below.

       <b>-U</b>
       <b>--disable-deterministic-archives</b>
           Do  <u>not</u>  operate  in  <u>deterministic</u>  mode.  This is the inverse of the <b>-D</b> option, above: when copying
           archive members and writing the archive index, use their actual UID, GID, timestamp,  and  file  mode
           values.

           This is the default unless <u>binutils</u> was configured with <b>--enable-deterministic-archives</b>.

       <b>--debugging</b>
           Convert  debugging  information, if possible.  This is not the default because only certain debugging
           formats are supported, and the conversion process can be time consuming.

       <b>--gap-fill</b> <u>val</u>
           Fill gaps between sections with <u>val</u>.  This operation  applies  to  the  <u>load</u>  <u>address</u>  (LMA)  of  the
           sections.   It  is  done by increasing the size of the section with the lower address, and filling in
           the extra space created with <u>val</u>.

       <b>--pad-to</b> <u>address</u>
           Pad the output file up to the load address <u>address</u>.  This is done by increasing the size of the  last
           section.  The extra space is filled in with the value specified by <b>--gap-fill</b> (default zero).

       <b>--set-start</b> <u>val</u>
           Set  the start address (also known as the entry address) of the new file to <u>val</u>.  Not all object file
           formats support setting the start address.

       <b>--change-start</b> <u>incr</u>
       <b>--adjust-start</b> <u>incr</u>
           Change the start address (also known as the entry address) by  adding  <u>incr</u>.   Not  all  object  file
           formats support setting the start address.

       <b>--change-addresses</b> <u>incr</u>
       <b>--adjust-vma</b> <u>incr</u>
           Change the VMA and LMA addresses of all sections, as well as the start address, by adding <u>incr</u>.  Some
           object  file  formats do not permit section addresses to be changed arbitrarily.  Note that this does
           not relocate the sections; if the program expects sections to be loaded at  a  certain  address,  and
           this  option  is  used  to  change the sections such that they are loaded at a different address, the
           program may fail.

       <b>--change-section-address</b> <u>sectionpattern</u><b>{=,+,-}</b><u>val</u>
       <b>--adjust-section-vma</b> <u>sectionpattern</u><b>{=,+,-}</b><u>val</u>
           Set or change both the VMA address and the LMA address of any section matching <u>sectionpattern</u>.  If  <b>=</b>
           is  used,  the  section  address  is  set  to <u>val</u>.  Otherwise, <u>val</u> is added to or subtracted from the
           section address.  See the comments under <b>--change-addresses</b>, above. If <u>sectionpattern</u> does not  match
           any sections in the input file, a warning will be issued, unless <b>--no-change-warnings</b> is used.

       <b>--change-section-lma</b> <u>sectionpattern</u><b>{=,+,-}</b><u>val</u>
           Set  or  change  the  LMA  address  of  any sections matching <u>sectionpattern</u>.  The LMA address is the
           address where the section will be loaded into memory at program load time.  Normally this is the same
           as the VMA address, which is the address of the section at program run time,  but  on  some  systems,
           especially those where a program is held in ROM, the two can be different.  If <b>=</b> is used, the section
           address  is  set to <u>val</u>.  Otherwise, <u>val</u> is added to or subtracted from the section address.  See the
           comments under <b>--change-addresses</b>, above.  If <u>sectionpattern</u> does not match any sections in the input
           file, a warning will be issued, unless <b>--no-change-warnings</b> is used.

       <b>--change-section-vma</b> <u>sectionpattern</u><b>{=,+,-}</b><u>val</u>
           Set or change the VMA address of any section matching <u>sectionpattern</u>.  The VMA address is the address
           where the section will be located once the program has started executing.  Normally this is the  same
           as  the  LMA  address, which is the address where the section will be loaded into memory, but on some
           systems, especially those where a program is held in ROM, the two can be different.  If  <b>=</b>  is  used,
           the  section  address  is  set  to  <u>val</u>.   Otherwise,  <u>val</u> is added to or subtracted from the section
           address.  See the comments under <b>--change-addresses</b>, above.  If <u>sectionpattern</u>  does  not  match  any
           sections in the input file, a warning will be issued, unless <b>--no-change-warnings</b> is used.

           Note - changing the VMA of sections in a fully linked binary can be dangerous since there may be code
           that expects the sections to be located at their old address.

       <b>--change-warnings</b>
       <b>--adjust-warnings</b>
           If  <b>--change-section-address</b> or <b>--change-section-lma</b> or <b>--change-section-vma</b> is used, and the section
           pattern does not match any sections, issue a warning.  This is the default.

       <b>--no-change-warnings</b>
       <b>--no-adjust-warnings</b>
           Do not issue a warning if <b>--change-section-address</b> or <b>--adjust-section-lma</b> or <b>--adjust-section-vma</b> is
           used, even if the section pattern does not match any sections.

       <b>--set-section-flags</b> <u>sectionpattern</u><b>=</b><u>flags</u>
           Set the flags for any sections matching <u>sectionpattern</u>.  The <u>flags</u>  argument  is  a  comma  separated
           string  of flag names.  The recognized names are <b>alloc</b>, <b>contents</b>, <b>load</b>, <b>noload</b>, <b>readonly</b>, <b>code</b>, <b>data</b>,
           <b>rom</b>, <b>exclude</b>, <b>share</b>, <b>debug</b>, and <b>large</b>.  You can set the <b>contents</b> flag for a section  which  does  not
           have  contents,  but  it  is  not  meaningful to clear the <b>contents</b> flag of a section which does have
           contents--just remove the section instead.  Not all flags are meaningful for all object file formats.
           In particular the <b>share</b> flag is only meaningful for COFF format files and not for ELF  format  files.
           The ELF x86-64 specific flag <b>large</b> corresponds to SHF_X86_64_LARGE.

       <b>--set-section-alignment</b> <u>sectionpattern</u><b>=</b><u>align</u>
           Set  the  alignment for any sections matching <u>sectionpattern</u>.  <u>align</u> specifies the alignment in bytes
           and must be a power of two, i.e. 1, 2, 4, 8....

           Note - setting a section's alignment will not automatically align its LMA or VMA addresses.  If those
           need to be changed as well then the <b>--change-section-lma</b> and/or <b>--change-section-vma</b>  options  should
           be used.  Also note that changing VMAs can cause problems in fully linked binaries where there may be
           code that expects the contents of the sections to be located at their old address.

       <b>--add-section</b> <u>sectionname</u><b>=</b><u>filename</u>
           Add  a  new  section  named  <u>sectionname</u> while copying the file.  The contents of the new section are
           taken from the file <u>filename</u>.  The size of the section will be the size of  the  file.   This  option
           only  works  on  file  formats  which  can  support  sections with arbitrary names.  Note - it may be
           necessary to use the <b>--set-section-flags</b> option to set the attributes of the newly created section.

       <b>--dump-section</b> <u>sectionname</u><b>=</b><u>filename</u>
           Place the contents of section named <u>sectionname</u> into the file <u>filename</u>, overwriting any contents that
           may have been there previously.  This option is the inverse of <b>--add-section</b>.  This option is similar
           to the <b>--only-section</b> option except that it does not create a  formatted  file,  it  just  dumps  the
           contents as raw binary data, without applying any relocations.  The option can be specified more than
           once.

       <b>--update-section</b> <u>sectionname</u><b>=</b><u>filename</u>
           Replace the existing contents of a section named <u>sectionname</u> with the contents of file <u>filename</u>.  The
           size of the section will be adjusted to the size of the file.  The section flags for <u>sectionname</u> will
           be  unchanged.   For  ELF  format  files  the  section to segment mapping will also remain unchanged,
           something which is not possible using <b>--remove-section</b> followed by <b>--add-section</b>.  The option can  be
           specified more than once.

           Note  -  it  is  possible  to  use  <b>--rename-section</b> and <b>--update-section</b> to both update and rename a
           section from one command line.  In this case, pass the original section name to <b>--update-section</b>, and
           the original and new section names to <b>--rename-section</b>.

       <b>--add-symbol</b> <u>name</u><b>=[</b><u>section</u><b>:]</b><u>value</u><b>[,</b><u>flags</u><b>]</b>
           Add a new symbol named <u>name</u> while copying the file.  This option may be specified multiple times.  If
           the <u>section</u> is given, the symbol will be associated with and relative to that section,  otherwise  it
           will  be  an  ABS symbol.  Specifying an undefined section will result in a fatal error.  There is no
           check for the value, it will be taken as specified.  Symbol flags can be specified and not all  flags
           will  be meaningful for all object file formats.  By default, the symbol will be global.  The special
           flag 'before=<u>othersym</u>' will insert the new symbol in front of the specified <u>othersym</u>,  otherwise  the
           symbol(s) will be added at the end of the symbol table in the order they appear.

       <b>--rename-section</b> <u>oldname</u><b>=</b><u>newname</u><b>[,</b><u>flags</u><b>]</b>
           Rename  a  section  from  <u>oldname</u> to <u>newname</u>, optionally changing the section's flags to <u>flags</u> in the
           process.  This has the advantage over using a linker script to perform the rename in that the  output
           stays as an object file and does not become a linked executable.  This option accepts the same set of
           flags as the <b>--set-section-flags</b> option.

           This  option is particularly helpful when the input format is binary, since this will always create a
           section called .data.  If for example,  you  wanted  instead  to  create  a  section  called  .rodata
           containing binary data you could use the following command line to achieve it:

                     objcopy -I binary -O &lt;output_format&gt; -B &lt;architecture&gt; \
                      --rename-section .data=.rodata,alloc,load,readonly,data,contents \
                      &lt;input_binary_file&gt; &lt;output_object_file&gt;

       <b>--long-section-names</b> <b>{enable,disable,keep}</b>
           Controls the handling of long section names when processing "COFF" and "PE-COFF" object formats.  The
           default behaviour, <b>keep</b>, is to preserve long section names if any are present in the input file.  The
           <b>enable</b>  and  <b>disable</b>  options  forcibly enable or disable the use of long section names in the output
           object; when <b>disable</b> is in effect, any long section names in the input object will be truncated.  The
           <b>enable</b> option will only emit long section names if any are present in the inputs; this is mostly  the
           same as <b>keep</b>, but it is left undefined whether the <b>enable</b> option might force the creation of an empty
           string table in the output file.

       <b>--change-leading-char</b>
           Some  object  file  formats  use  special  characters  at the start of symbols.  The most common such
           character is underscore, which compilers often add before every symbol.  This option tells <b>objcopy</b> to
           change the leading character of every symbol when it converts between object file  formats.   If  the
           object  file  formats  use the same leading character, this option has no effect.  Otherwise, it will
           add a character, or remove a character, or change a character, as appropriate.

       <b>--remove-leading-char</b>
           If the first character of a global symbol is a special symbol leading character used  by  the  object
           file  format,  remove  the  character.  The most common symbol leading character is underscore.  This
           option will remove a leading underscore from all global symbols.  This can be useful if you  want  to
           link together objects of different file formats with different conventions for symbol names.  This is
           different  from  <b>--change-leading-char</b>  because  it  always changes the symbol name when appropriate,
           regardless of the object file format of the output file.

       <b>--reverse-bytes=</b><u>num</u>
           Reverse the bytes in a section with output contents.  A section length must be  evenly  divisible  by
           the  value  given  in  order  for the swap to be able to take place. Reversing takes place before the
           interleaving is performed.

           This option is used typically in generating ROM images for problematic target systems.  For  example,
           on  some  target  boards,  the 32-bit words fetched from 8-bit ROMs are re-assembled in little-endian
           byte order regardless of the CPU byte order.  Depending on the programming model, the  endianness  of
           the ROM may need to be modified.

           Consider a simple file with a section containing the following eight bytes:  12345678.

           Using  <b>--reverse-bytes=2</b>  for  the  above  example,  the  bytes  in  the output file would be ordered
           21436587.

           Using <b>--reverse-bytes=4</b> for the above example,  the  bytes  in  the  output  file  would  be  ordered
           43218765.

           By  using  <b>--reverse-bytes=2</b> for the above example, followed by <b>--reverse-bytes=4</b> on the output file,
           the bytes in the second output file would be ordered 34127856.

       <b>--srec-len=</b><u>ival</u>
           Meaningful only for srec output.  Set the maximum length of the  Srecords  being  produced  to  <u>ival</u>.
           This length covers both address, data and crc fields.

       <b>--srec-forceS3</b>
           Meaningful only for srec output.  Avoid generation of S1/S2 records, creating S3-only record format.

       <b>--redefine-sym</b> <u>old</u><b>=</b><u>new</u>
           Change  the  name  of  a  symbol  <u>old</u>, to <u>new</u>.  This can be useful when one is trying link two things
           together for which you have no source, and there are name collisions.

       <b>--redefine-syms=</b><u>filename</u>
           Apply <b>--redefine-sym</b> to each symbol pair "<u>old</u> <u>new</u>" listed in the file <u>filename</u>.  <u>filename</u> is simply a
           flat file, with one symbol pair per line.  Line comments may be introduced  by  the  hash  character.
           This option may be given more than once.

       <b>--weaken</b>
           Change  all  global symbols in the file to be weak.  This can be useful when building an object which
           will be linked against other objects using the  <b>-R</b>  option  to  the  linker.   This  option  is  only
           effective when using an object file format which supports weak symbols.

       <b>--keep-symbols=</b><u>filename</u>
           Apply  <b>--keep-symbol</b>  option  to  each symbol listed in the file <u>filename</u>.  <u>filename</u> is simply a flat
           file, with one symbol name per line.  Line comments may be introduced by the  hash  character.   This
           option may be given more than once.

       <b>--strip-symbols=</b><u>filename</u>
           Apply  <b>--strip-symbol</b>  option  to each symbol listed in the file <u>filename</u>.  <u>filename</u> is simply a flat
           file, with one symbol name per line.  Line comments may be introduced by the  hash  character.   This
           option may be given more than once.

       <b>--strip-unneeded-symbols=</b><u>filename</u>
           Apply  <b>--strip-unneeded-symbol</b> option to each symbol listed in the file <u>filename</u>.  <u>filename</u> is simply
           a flat file, with one symbol name per line.  Line comments may be introduced by the  hash  character.
           This option may be given more than once.

       <b>--keep-global-symbols=</b><u>filename</u>
           Apply  <b>--keep-global-symbol</b>  option to each symbol listed in the file <u>filename</u>.  <u>filename</u> is simply a
           flat file, with one symbol name per line.  Line comments may be introduced  by  the  hash  character.
           This option may be given more than once.

       <b>--localize-symbols=</b><u>filename</u>
           Apply <b>--localize-symbol</b> option to each symbol listed in the file <u>filename</u>.  <u>filename</u> is simply a flat
           file,  with  one  symbol name per line.  Line comments may be introduced by the hash character.  This
           option may be given more than once.

       <b>--globalize-symbols=</b><u>filename</u>
           Apply <b>--globalize-symbol</b> option to each symbol listed in the file <u>filename</u>.   <u>filename</u>  is  simply  a
           flat  file,  with  one  symbol name per line.  Line comments may be introduced by the hash character.
           This option may be given more than once.  Note: this option cannot be used in conjunction with the <b>-G</b>
           or <b>--keep-global-symbol</b> options.

       <b>--weaken-symbols=</b><u>filename</u>
           Apply <b>--weaken-symbol</b> option to each symbol listed in the file <u>filename</u>.  <u>filename</u> is simply  a  flat
           file,  with  one  symbol name per line.  Line comments may be introduced by the hash character.  This
           option may be given more than once.

       <b>--alt-machine-code=</b><u>index</u>
           If the output architecture has alternate machine codes, use the <u>index</u>th code instead of  the  default
           one.  This is useful in case a machine is assigned an official code and the tool-chain adopts the new
           code,  but  other  applications  still  depend  on  the  original  code  being  used.   For ELF based
           architectures if the <u>index</u> alternative does not exist then the value is treated as an absolute number
           to be stored in the e_machine field of the ELF header.

       <b>--writable-text</b>
           Mark the output text as writable.  This option isn't meaningful for all object file formats.

       <b>--readonly-text</b>
           Make the output text write protected.  This option isn't meaningful for all object file formats.

       <b>--pure</b>
           Mark the output file as demand paged.  This option isn't meaningful for all object file formats.

       <b>--impure</b>
           Mark the output file as impure.  This option isn't meaningful for all object file formats.

       <b>--prefix-symbols=</b><u>string</u>
           Prefix all symbols in the output file with <u>string</u>.

       <b>--prefix-sections=</b><u>string</u>
           Prefix all section names in the output file with <u>string</u>.

       <b>--prefix-alloc-sections=</b><u>string</u>
           Prefix all the names of all allocated sections in the output file with <u>string</u>.

       <b>--add-gnu-debuglink=</b><u>path-to-file</u>
           Creates a .gnu_debuglink section which contains a reference to <u>path-to-file</u> and adds it to the output
           file.  Note: the file at <u>path-to-file</u> must exist.  Part of the process of adding  the  .gnu_debuglink
           section involves embedding a checksum of the contents of the debug info file into the section.

           If  the debug info file is built in one location but it is going to be installed at a later time into
           a different location then do not use the path to the  installed  location.   The  <b>--add-gnu-debuglink</b>
           option  will  fail because the installed file does not exist yet.  Instead put the debug info file in
           the current directory and use the <b>--add-gnu-debuglink</b> option without any directory  components,  like
           this:

                    objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink=foo.debug

           At  debug  time  the debugger will attempt to look for the separate debug info file in a set of known
           locations.  The exact set of these locations varies depending upon the distribution being  used,  but
           it typically includes:

           "* The same directory as the executable."
           "* A sub-directory of the directory containing the executable"
               called .debug

           "* A global debug directory such as /usr/lib/debug."

           As  long as the debug info file has been installed into one of these locations before the debugger is
           run everything should work correctly.

       <b>--keep-section-symbols</b>
           When stripping a file, perhaps with <b>--strip-debug</b> or <b>--strip-unneeded</b>, retain any symbols  specifying
           section names, which would otherwise get stripped.

       <b>--keep-file-symbols</b>
           When  stripping a file, perhaps with <b>--strip-debug</b> or <b>--strip-unneeded</b>, retain any symbols specifying
           source file names, which would otherwise get stripped.

       <b>--only-keep-debug</b>
           Strip a file, removing contents of any sections that would  not  be  stripped  by  <b>--strip-debug</b>  and
           leaving the debugging sections intact.  In ELF files, this preserves all note sections in the output.

           Note  -  the  section  headers of the stripped sections are preserved, including their sizes, but the
           contents of the section are discarded.  The section headers are preserved so  that  other  tools  can
           match up the debuginfo file with the real executable, even if that executable has been relocated to a
           different address space.

           The  intention  is  that this option will be used in conjunction with <b>--add-gnu-debuglink</b> to create a
           two part executable.  One a stripped binary which will occupy less space in RAM and in a distribution
           and the second a debugging information file which is only needed if debugging abilities are required.
           The suggested procedure to create these files is as follows:

           1.&lt;Link the executable as normal.  Assuming that it is called&gt;
               "foo" then...

           1.&lt;Run "objcopy --only-keep-debug foo foo.dbg" to&gt;
               create a file containing the debugging info.

           1.&lt;Run "objcopy --strip-debug foo" to create a&gt;
               stripped executable.

           1.&lt;Run "objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink=foo.dbg foo"&gt;
               to add a link to the debugging info into the stripped executable.

           Note---the choice of ".dbg" as an  extension  for  the  debug  info  file  is  arbitrary.   Also  the
           "--only-keep-debug" step is optional.  You could instead do this:

           1.&lt;Link the executable as normal.&gt;
           1.&lt;Copy "foo" to  "foo.full"&gt;
           1.&lt;Run "objcopy --strip-debug foo"&gt;
           1.&lt;Run "objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink=foo.full foo"&gt;

           i.e., the file pointed to by the <b>--add-gnu-debuglink</b> can be the full executable.  It does not have to
           be a file created by the <b>--only-keep-debug</b> switch.

           Note---this  switch is only intended for use on fully linked files.  It does not make sense to use it
           on object files where the debugging information may be incomplete.  Besides the gnu_debuglink feature
           currently only supports the presence of one filename containing debugging information,  not  multiple
           filenames on a one-per-object-file basis.

       <b>--strip-dwo</b>
           Remove  the  contents  of  all  DWARF .dwo sections, leaving the remaining debugging sections and all
           symbols intact.  This option is intended for use by the compiler as part of the <b>-gsplit-dwarf</b> option,
           which splits debug information between the .o file and a separate .dwo file.  The compiler  generates
           all  debug information in the same file, then uses the <b>--extract-dwo</b> option to copy the .dwo sections
           to the .dwo file, then the <b>--strip-dwo</b> option to remove those sections from the original .o file.

       <b>--extract-dwo</b>
           Extract the contents of all DWARF .dwo sections.  See the <b>--strip-dwo</b> option for more information.

       <b>--file-alignment</b> <u>num</u>
           Specify the file alignment.  Sections in the file  will  always  begin  at  file  offsets  which  are
           multiples of this number.  This defaults to 512.  [This option is specific to PE targets.]

       <b>--heap</b> <u>reserve</u>
       <b>--heap</b> <u>reserve</u><b>,</b><u>commit</u>
           Specify  the number of bytes of memory to reserve (and optionally commit) to be used as heap for this
           program.  [This option is specific to PE targets.]

       <b>--image-base</b> <u>value</u>
           Use <u>value</u> as the base address of your program or dll.  This is the lowest memory location  that  will
           be  used  when your program or dll is loaded.  To reduce the need to relocate and improve performance
           of your dlls, each should have a unique base address and not overlap any other dlls.  The default  is
           0x400000 for executables, and 0x10000000 for dlls.  [This option is specific to PE targets.]

       <b>--section-alignment</b> <u>num</u>
           [This option is specific to PE targets.]

           Sets  the  section  alignment  field in the PE header - if one is present in the binary.  Sections in
           memory will always begin at addresses which are a multiple of this number.  Defaults to 0x1000.

           Note - this option will also set the alignment field in each section's flags.

           Note - if a section's LMA or VMA addresses are no longer aligned, and those addresses have  not  been
           set  via  the  <b>--set-section-lma</b>  or <b>--set-section-vma</b> options, and the file has been fully relocated
           then a warning message will be issued.  It will then be up to the user to decide if the LMA  and  VMA
           need updating.

       <b>--stack</b> <u>reserve</u>
       <b>--stack</b> <u>reserve</u><b>,</b><u>commit</u>
           Specify the number of bytes of memory to reserve (and optionally commit) to be used as stack for this
           program.  [This option is specific to PE targets.]

       <b>--subsystem</b> <u>which</u>
       <b>--subsystem</b> <u>which</u><b>:</b><u>major</u>
       <b>--subsystem</b> <u>which</u><b>:</b><u>major</u><b>.</b><u>minor</u>
           Specifies  the  subsystem  under  which  your  program  will execute.  The legal values for <u>which</u> are
           "native", "windows", "console", "posix", "efi-app", "efi-bsd", "efi-rtd", "sal-rtd", and "xbox".  You
           may optionally set the subsystem version also.  Numeric values are also accepted  for  <u>which</u>.   [This
           option is specific to PE targets.]

       <b>--extract-symbol</b>
           Keep the file's section flags and symbols but remove all section data.  Specifically, the option:

           *&lt;removes the contents of all sections;&gt;
           *&lt;sets the size of every section to zero; and&gt;
           *&lt;sets the file's start address to zero.&gt;

           This  option  is  used  to  build  a  <u>.sym</u> file for a VxWorks kernel.  It can also be a useful way of
           reducing the size of a <b>--just-symbols</b> linker input file.

       <b>--compress-debug-sections</b>
           Compress DWARF debug sections using zlib with SHF_COMPRESSED from the ELF ABI.  Note - if compression
           would actually make a section <u>larger</u>, then it is not compressed.

       <b>--compress-debug-sections=none</b>
       <b>--compress-debug-sections=zlib</b>
       <b>--compress-debug-sections=zlib-gnu</b>
       <b>--compress-debug-sections=zlib-gabi</b>
       <b>--compress-debug-sections=zstd</b>
           For   ELF   files,   these   options   control   how   DWARF   debug   sections    are    compressed.
           <b>--compress-debug-sections=none</b>        is       equivalent       to       <b>--decompress-debug-sections</b>.
           <b>--compress-debug-sections=zlib</b>   and   <b>--compress-debug-sections=zlib-gabi</b>    are    equivalent    to
           <b>--compress-debug-sections</b>.   <b>--compress-debug-sections=zlib-gnu</b> compresses DWARF debug sections using
           the  obsoleted  zlib-gnu  format.   The  debug  sections  are  renamed   to   begin   with   <b>.zdebug</b>.
           <b>--compress-debug-sections=zstd</b>  compresses  DWARF  debug  sections using zstd.  Note - if compression
           would actually make a section <u>larger</u>, then it is not compressed nor renamed.

       <b>--decompress-debug-sections</b>
           Decompress DWARF debug sections.  For a <b>.zdebug</b> section, the original name is restored.

       <b>--elf-stt-common=yes</b>
       <b>--elf-stt-common=no</b>
           For ELF files, these options control whether common symbols should be converted to  the  "STT_COMMON"
           or   "STT_OBJECT"   type.    <b>--elf-stt-common=yes</b>   converts  common  symbol  type  to  "STT_COMMON".
           <b>--elf-stt-common=no</b> converts common symbol type to "STT_OBJECT".

       <b>--merge-notes</b>
       <b>--no-merge-notes</b>
           For ELF files, attempt (or do not attempt) to reduce the  size  of  any  SHT_NOTE  type  sections  by
           removing duplicate notes.

       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
           Show the version number of <b>objcopy</b>.

       <b>--verilog-data-width=</b><u>bytes</u>
           For Verilog output, this options controls the number of bytes converted for each output data element.
           The input target controls the endianness of the conversion.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--verbose</b>
           Verbose  output:  list  all  object  files  modified.   In the case of archives, <b>objcopy</b> <b>-V</b> lists all
           members of the archive.

       <b>--help</b>
           Show a summary of the options to <b>objcopy</b>.

       <b>--info</b>
           Display a list showing all architectures and object formats available.

       <b>@</b><u>file</u>
           Read command-line options from <u>file</u>.  The options read are inserted in place of  the  original  @<u>file</u>
           option.   If  <u>file</u>  does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and
           not removed.

           Options in <u>file</u> are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace character may be included in an option  by
           surrounding  the  entire  option  in  either  single  or  double  quotes.  Any character (including a
           backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included with a backslash.  The <u>file</u>  may
           itself contain additional @<u>file</u> options; any such options will be processed recursively.
