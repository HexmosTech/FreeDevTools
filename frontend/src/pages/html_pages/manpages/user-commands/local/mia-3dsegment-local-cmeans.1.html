</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mia-3dsegment-local-cmeans</b>  This  program  runs the segmentation of a 3D image by applying a localized c-
       means approach that helps to overcome intensity inhomogeneities in the image. The  approach  evaluates  a
       global  c-means  clustering,  and  then  separates  the image into overlapping regions where more c-means
       iterations are run only including the locally present classes, i.e. the classes that  relatively  contain
       more pixels than a given threshold. This program implements algorithm described in:

              ontological material. PeerJ 6:e4374.

   <b>Parameters</b>
              -g --grid-spacing=15; int in [3, inf)
                     Spacing of the grid used to modulate the intensity inhomogeneities

              -c --cmeans=kmeans:nc=3
                     c-means initializer
                      For supported plugins see PLUGINS:1d/cmeans

              -e --c-means-epsilon=0.0001; float in (0, inf)
                     c-means breaking condition for update tolerance

              -t --relative-cluster-threshold=0.02; double in [0, 1)
                     threshhold to ignore classes when initializing the local cmeans from the global one.

              -B --ignore-background
                     Don't  take  background  probablities  into account when desiding whether classes are to be
                     ignored

              -L --label-threshold=0; float in [0, 1]
                     for values &lt;= 0.5: create segmentation based on highest class probability, labels start  at
                     0.  For values &gt;0.5: create labels only for voxels with a class probability higher than the
                     given value, labels start at 1 and voxels without an according class probability are set to
                     0; this output is suitable for the seeded watershed filter.

   <b>Processing</b>
                 --threads=-1
                     Maxiumum number of threads to use for processing,This number should be lower  or  equal  to
