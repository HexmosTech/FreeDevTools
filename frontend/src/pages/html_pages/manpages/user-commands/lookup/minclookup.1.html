       minclookup - perform lookup table conversions on minc files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>minclookup</b> [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;in1&gt;.mnc &lt;out&gt;.mnc

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Minclookup</u> will perform a lookup table operation on each voxel of a minc file. A lookup table consists of
       a  list  of input values with matching output values. Each voxel of the input file is found in the lookup
       table and the corresponding output value is written out. These output values  can  be  either  scalar  or
       vector values so, for example, a colour lookup table would have four columns: one column for input values
       and one column for each of red, green and blue output values.

       Lookup tables can take one of two forms: <u>continuous</u> or <u>discrete</u>.

       A  continuous lookup table is for treating voxel values as continuous (real) values and converting values
       by doing interpolation between the values given in the lookup table. A discrete lookup table treats input
       values as integers and deals with them as completely independent entries, doing no interpolation.

       The most common use of continuous lookup tables is for converting intensity values into RGB  colours.  To
       make the lookup tables simpler, the input values are all rescaled into the range zero to one. By default,
       the  smallest value in the file maps to zero and the largest maps to one. This value is then found in the
       lookup table, usually between two entries in the table (the table is always sorted in ascending order  of
       input  values).  Linear  interpolation  is  then  done  on each output column and the resultant value (or
       values) is written to the output file. If there is more than one output value per input value,  then  the
       dimension  vector_dimension is added to the output file with length equal to the number of output columns
       in the lookup table. For input values outside the range zero to one, the nearest table value is used.

       Discrete lookup tables are usually used for remapping label values. Each input value  is  treated  as  an
       integer  (it  is  not  rescaled) and if it is found in the lookup table, then the corresponding value (or
       values) is written to the output file. If it is not found, then a null value  is  written  out  (zero  by
       default).  No  interpolation  is done with discrete lookup tables - to get a non-null output value, there
       must be an entry in the table.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Note that options can be specified in abbreviated form (as long as they are  unique)  and  can  be  given
       anywhere on the command line.

</pre><h4><b>General</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-2</b>     Create a MINC 2.0 format output file.

       <b>-clobber</b>
              Overwrite an existing file.

       <b>-noclobber</b>
              Don't overwrite an existing file (default).

       <b>-no_clobber</b>
              Synonym for <b>-noclobber</b>.

       <b>-verbose</b>
              Print out progress information for each chunk of data copied (default).

       <b>-quiet</b> Do not print out progress information.

       <b>-buffer_size</b> <u>size</u>
              Specify the maximum size of the internal buffers (in kbytes). Default is 10 MB.

       <b>-filetype</b>
              Create an output file with the same type as the first input file (default).

       <b>-byte</b>  Store each voxel as an 8-bit integer.

       <b>-short</b> Store each voxel as a 16-bit integer.

       <b>-int</b>   Store each voxel as a 32-bit integer.

       <b>-long</b>  Superseded by <b>-int</b>.

       <b>-float</b> Store each voxel in 32-bit floating point format.

       <b>-double</b>
              Store each voxel in 64-bit floating point format.

       <b>-signed</b>
              Create an output file with data stored in a signed type. This option is meaningless when used with
              floating point data formats, which are always signed.

       <b>-unsigned</b>
              Create  an  output file with data stored in an unsigned type. This option is meaningless when used
              with floating point data formats.

       <b>-valid_range</b> <u>min</u> <u>max</u>
              Scale integer voxel values to fall between the values <u>min</u>  and  <u>max</u>.   By  default  integer  voxel
              values  will  be scaled to use the entire range of the base type.  This option is meaningless when
              used with floating point data formats.

</pre><h4><b>Lookup</b> <b>table</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-gray</b>  Use a gray lookup table to write out RGB values (default).

       <b>-grey</b>  Synonym for <b>-gray</b>.

       <b>-hotmetal</b>
              Use a hot-metal lookup table to write out RGB values.

       <b>-spectral</b>
              Use a spectral (rainbow) lookup table to write out RGB values.

       <b>-invert</b>
              Invert the lookup table so that the maximum value maps to zero and the minimum value maps to  one.
              Applies only to continuous lookup tables.

       <b>-noinvert</b>
              Do not invert the lookup table - the minimum maps to zero and the maximum maps to one (default).

       <b>-range</b> <u>min</u> <u>max</u>
              Specify  the range of values that should map to the range of the lookup table (default is the full
              range of the input file).

       <b>-minimum</b> <u>min</u>
              Specify the input value that maps to the minimum value in the lookup table.

       <b>-maximum</b> <u>max</u>
              Specify the input value that maps to the maximum value in the lookup table.

       <b>-lookup_table</b> [<u>file</u> | <b>-</b>]
              Specify the name of a file containing the lookup table. If <b>-</b> is given, the lookup  table  is  read
              from the standard input. The file must have at least two columns: The first column gives the input
              values; the other columns give the corresponding output values. For a continuous lookup table, the
              first  column should contain a value between zero and one inclusive Explicit entries for both zero
              and one should usually be given. For a discrete lookup table,  the  first  column  should  contain
              integer  values.  If  more  than  one  output  column is given, then the output file will have the
              dimension <b>vector_dimension</b> with a length equal to the number of output columns. The lines  of  the
              table will be sorted if necessary so that the first column is in ascending order.

       <b>-lut_string</b> <u>lookup-table-string</u>
              Specify  the  complete  lookup  table  as  a single string. The semicolon character ";" is used to
              separate lines.

       <b>-continuous</b>
              The lookup table is continuous (see description above): Input values  are  treated  as  continuous
              (real)  values  and are rescaled to the range zero to one before being looked up; interpolation is
              done between values in the table. This is the default behaviour.

       <b>-discrete</b>
              The lookup table is discrete (see description above): Input values are treated as integers and  no
              interpolation is done between input values.

       <b>-null_value</b> <u>null-value-string</u>
              Specify  a  null  value  to  be  used with discrete lookup tables when a value is not found in the
              lookup table. This value must be specified as a comma-separated list  of  values,  with  the  same
              number of values as output columns in the lookup table.

</pre><h4><b>Generic</b> <b>options</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>commands:</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-help</b>  Print summary of command-line options and exit.

       <b>-version</b>
              Print the program's version number and exit.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To get hot-metal RGB images from an MRI file:

          minclookup -hotmetal input.mnc output.mnc

       To convert the labels in a minc label file, use -discrete:

          minclookup -discrete -lookup_table lookupfile \
             in_labels.mnc out_labels.mnc

       where lookupfile is a file containing entries to map label 2 to 4 and label 3 to 5:

          2 4
          3 5

       You could also specify this lookup table on the command line:

          minclookup -discrete -lut_string '2 4;3 5' \
             in_labels.mnc out_labels.mnc

       To  get  a grey RGB file, with red for values less than the minimum and green for values greater than the
       minimum, you can give two zero entries and two one entries. The first zero is used for  negative  values,
       the  second zero is used for interpolation to the next entry. There is no ambiguity about how to handle a
       value of exactly zero because the first and last values of the table are handled in a special way to make
       sure that they are treated as within range if this sort of two-entry situation occurs.

          minclookup -lookup_table - input.mnc output.mnc &lt;&lt;EOF
          0 1 0 0
          0 0 0 0
          1 1 1 1
          1 0 1 0
          EOF

       To invert a scalar image, you could use minclookup:

          minclookup -lut_string '0 1;1 0' in.mnc out.mnc
