</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mpc-ace, mwc-ace — generate project and workspace files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mpc-ace</b> [<u>OPTION</u> ...]  [<u>FILE</u> ...]

       <b>mwc-ace</b> [<u>OPTION</u> ...]  [<u>FILE</u> ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mpc-ace</b>  and <b>mwc-ace</b>, the Makefile, Project and Workspace Creator generate platform and compiler specific
       files to automate the compilation process (e.g. <b>GNUmakefile</b>     and <b>Makefile.am</b>).

       The most common way to use the Make Project Creator is to run the workspace  generator  (<b>mwc-ace</b>).   This
       script  will  generate projects and a single workspace that contains the generated projects.  If no input
       <u>FILE</u> (<b>.mwc</b> file) is specified, it will recurse into the directory in which the script  was  started.   It
       looks for <b>.mpc</b> files and generates a project or projects for each one found.

       Most  of  what  is stated about <b>mwc-ace</b> applies to <b>mpc-ace</b> except that it only generates projects.  If an
       input <u>FILE</u> (<b>.mpc</b> file) is not provided, the project creator will attempt to create a default  project  in
       the directory from which the script was started.

       <b>-global</b> <u>file</u>
                 specifies  the  global input file.  Values stored within this file are applied to all projects.
                 If not specified, defaults to <b>config/global.mpb</b>

       <b>-include</b> <u>directory</u>
                 specifies a directory to search when looking  for  base  projects,  template  input  files  and
                 templates.  This option can be used multiple times to add directories.  Two include directories
                 are used by default (<b>config</b>      and <b>templates</b>)

       <b>-recurse</b>  recurse from the current directory and generate from all found input files.

       <b>-ti</b> <b>dll</b> <b>|</b> <b>lib</b> <b>|</b> <b>dll_exe</b> <b>|</b> <b>lib_exe:</b><u>file</u>
                 specifies  the  template  input  file  (with  no  extension)  for  the  specific type, e.g. <b>-ti</b>
                 <b>dll_exe:vc8exe</b>.  Each project creator has a default  template  input  file  for  each  type  of
                 project  (<b>dll_exe</b>,  <b>lib_exe</b>,  <b>dll</b>, <b>lib</b>).  You can override the default template input file name
                 with the <b>-ti</b> option.  The file must have a <b>mpt</b> extension and must  reside  within  the  include
                 search  directories.   NOTE:  the  <b>lib</b>       and the <b>lib_exe</b> template input files are only used
                 when MPC is generating static projects

       <b>-hierarchy</b>
                 generate a workspace in a hierarchical  fashion.   Forces  the  generation  of  a  hierarchical
                 workspace  at  each  directory  level in between the toplevel directory and the location of the
                 <b>.mpc</b> file that is being processed.  This is the default  for  <b>make</b>  based  workspace  creators.
                 NOTE: This option has no effect when when used with <b>mpc-ace</b>

       <b>-template</b> <u>file</u>
                 specifies  the template name (with no extension).  <u>file</u> should have a <b>.mpd</b> extension and sit in
                 one of the include search directories.  NOTE: The <b>-template</b>       option overrides the template
                 file for all types specified

       <b>-relative</b> <u>name</u>=<u>var</u>
                 any <b>$()</b> variable in an mpc file that is matched to <u>name</u> is replaced by <u>var</u> only if <u>var</u>  can  be
                 made into a relative path based on the current working directory

       <b>-base</b> <u>project</u>
                 add <u>project</u> as a base project to each generated project file.  Do not provide a file extension,
                 the <b>.mpb</b> extension will be tried first; if that fails the <b>.mpc</b> extension will be tried

       <b>-nocomments</b>
                 do not place comments in the generated files

       <b>-noreldefs</b>
                 do  not  try  to  generate default relative definitions for <b>*_ROOT</b>, which come from environment
                 variables

       <b>-notoplevel</b>
                 do not generate the top level target file.  Files are still processed, but no top level file is
                 created.  For <b>mwc-ace</b>, it says process all projects for a workspace, but do  not  generate  the
                 top level workspace file.  For <b>mpc-ace</b>, it says process the <b>.mpc</b> files, but do not generate the
                 project files

       <b>-static</b>   specifies  that  only static projects are generated.  By default, only dynamic projects will be
                 generated.  This parameter was  previously  <b>-static_only</b>.   Currently,  <b>mpc-ace</b>  only  supports
                 generating  dynamic projects or static projects, but not both during the same run.  To generate
                 them both you must  run  <b>mpc-ace</b>  twice,  once  with  the  <b>-static</b>  option  and  once  without.
                 Additionally,  the  <b>vc6</b>, <b>em3</b>, <b>vc7</b>, <b>vc71</b> and <b>vc8</b> project names will no longer automatically have
                 <b>_Static</b> appended to the project name when  generating  static  projects.   This  can  still  be
                 achieved by using the <b>-name_modifier</b> option.

                 When generating static projects, inter-project dependencies will not be generated for libraries
                 within  <b>vc6</b>,  <b>em3</b>,  <b>vc7</b>,  and <b>vc71</b>  workspaces.  The reason is due to the fact that each static
                 library that depended upon another would be combined at the library creation  stage,  resulting
                 in  extremely  large  libraries.   Dependencies  are  handled correctly by vc8 and later.  This
                 behavior can be modified  by  setting  the  MPC_DEPENDENCY_COMBINED_STATIC_LIBRARY  environment
                 variable.   It will force <b>mpc-ace</b> to generate inter-project dependencies for libraries within a
                 single workspace

       <b>-genins</b>   generate <b>.ins</b> files after processing each project that can be  used  in  conjunction  with  the
                 <b>prj_install.pl</b>  script to install different parts of the project (such as header files) into an
                 alternate location

       <b>-use_env</b>  use environment variables for all uses of <b>$()</b> instead of the relative replacement values

       <b>-value_template</b> <u>name</u><b>+=</b><u>val</u> | <u>name</u><b>=</b><u>val</u> | <u>name</u><b>-=</b><u>val</u>
                 this option allows modification of a template input name pair.  Use <b>+=</b> to add <u>val</u> to the <u>name</u>'s
                 value.  Use <b>-=</b> to subtract and <b>=</b> to override the value.  If  a  template  variable  value  will
                 contain  spaces, it is best to enclose the whole setting in double quotes and use single quotes
                 within the value to retain spaces (if it is necessary)

       <b>-value_project</b> <u>name</u><b>+=</b><u>val</u> | <u>name</u><b>=</b><u>val</u> | <u>name</u><b>-=</b><u>val</u>
                 this option allows modification of a project variable assignment.  Use <b>+=</b> to  add  <u>val</u>  to  the
                 <u>name</u>'s  value.   Use <b>-=</b> to subtract and <b>=</b> to override the value.  This can be used to introduce
                 new name value pairs to a project.  However, it must be a valid project assignment

       <b>-make_coexistence</b>
                 if multiple <b>make</b> based project types are generated, they will  be  named  such  that  they  can
                 coexist

       <b>-feature_file</b> <u>file</u>
                 specifies  the  features  file to read before processing.  These feature names can be anything,
                 but they should correspond to values used for the <b>requires</b> and <b>avoids</b> keywords.  If  a  feature
                 is  required  and  is  not enabled then the project will not be created.  If a feature is to be
                 avoided and it is enabled then the project will not be created.  The default  feature  file  is
                 <b>default.features</b> under the <b>config</b> directory

       <b>-expand_vars</b>
                 perform  direct  expansion,  instead of performing relative replacement with either <b>-use_env</b> or
                 <b>-relative</b> options

       <b>-features</b> <u>features</u>
                 specifies the feature list to set before processing.  Values specified by this option overwrite
                 values from features files, e.g. <b>-features</b> <b>"qos=1,ssl=0"</b>

       <b>-gendot</b>   generate .dot files for use with <b>Graphvis</b>.  This option, which is  only  useful  with  <b>mwc-ace</b>,
                 will  result in the generation of .dot files for each workspace processed.  Each .dot file will
                 contain information that can be fed to Graphvis to display the dependency information  for  the
                 various projects found within the workspace.

       <b>-exclude</b> <u>directories</u>
                 use  this  option  to  exclude directories or files when searching for input files.  NOTE: This
                 option has no effect when used with <b>mpc-ace</b>

       <b>-name_modifier</b> <u>pattern</u>
                 modify generated workspace or project names.  The <u>pattern</u> passed to this  parameter  will  have
                 the <b>*</b> portion replaced with the actual output name.  For example <b>-name_modifier</b> <b>'*_Static'</b> will
                 result  in  all  workspace  and  project  names  ending  in  <b>_Static</b>,  e.g.  <b>FOO_Static.dsw</b> and
                 <b>FOO_Static.dsp</b>

       <b>-apply_project</b>
                 when used in conjunction with <b>-name_modifier</b>, it applies the name modifier to the project  name
                 also.  NOTE: this option has no effect without the <b>-name_modifier</b> option

       <b>-workers</b>  Specifies number of child processes to use to generate projects.

       <b>-workers_dir</b>
                 The  directory  for  storing  temporary  output files from the child processes.  The default is
                 '/tmp/mpc' If neither -workers_dir nor -workers_port is used, -workers_dir is assumed.

       <b>-workers_port</b>
                 The port number for the parent listener.

       <b>-version</b>  print the MPC version and exit

       <b>-into</b> <u>directory</u>
                 place all output files in a mirrored directory structure starting at <u>directory</u>

       <b>-gfeature_file</b> <u>file</u>
                 specifies the global feature file.  The default  value  is  <b>global.features</b>  under  the  <b>config</b>
                 directory

       <b>-language</b> <b>cplusplus</b> <b>|</b> <b>csharp</b> <b>|</b> <b>java</b> <b>|</b> <b>vb</b>
                 specify the language preference.  The default is <b>cplusplus</b>

       <b>-type</b> <b>automake</b> <b>|</b> <b>bcb2007</b> <b>|</b> <b>bcb2009</b> <b>|</b> <b>bds4</b> <b>|</b> <b>bmake</b> <b>|</b> <b>cc</b> <b>|</b> <b>em3</b> <b>|</b> <b>ghs</b> <b>|</b> <b>html</b> <b>|</b> <b>make</b> <b>|</b> <b>nmake</b> <b>|</b> <b>sle</b> <b>|</b> <b>vc6</b> <b>|</b>
       <b>vc7</b> <b>|</b> <b>vc71</b> <b>|</b> <b>vc8</b> <b>|</b> <b>vc9</b> <b>|</b> <b>vc10</b> <b>|</b> <b>wb26</b>
                 specifies  the  type  of  project  file to generate.  This option can be used multiple times to
                 generate multiple types.  There is no longer a default.  NOTE: The <b>-ti</b>     option overrides the
                 template input file for all types specified

   <b>MPC</b> <b>Codebase</b> <b>Configuration</b> <b>File</b>
       This configuration file can be used to specify alternate locations for the MPC Configuration File.  If  a
       base.cfg  is  found underneath the 'config' directory where MPC is executed, it will be read to determine
       the location of MPC.cfg based on the directory in which MPC was started.

       For example, if $MPC_ROOT/mwc-ace is run under /foo/bar_root/src and $MPC_ROOT/config/base.cfg contained:

       /foo/bar_root = /foo/bar_root/MPC/config

       MPC would attempt to open and read /foo/bar_root/MPC/config/MPC.cfg as the MPC  Configuration  File.   If
       the  base  configuration  file  is  not  present, MPC will try to use $MPC_ROOT/config/MPC.cfg as the MPC
       Configuration File.

       You may reference environment variables, accessed by $NAME, on either side of the equals sign.

   <b>MPC</b> <b>Configuration</b> <b>File</b>
       In an effort to move away  from  the  use  of  environment  variables,  a  configuration  file  has  been
       introduced.   The  configuration  file  (MPC.cfg)  can  contain settings to provide command line options,
       control logging and direct MPC to dynamic project types.

       The following keywords are allowed in the configuration file,  which  will  be  read  from  the  'config'
       directory of MPC.

       <b>command_line</b>
                 provide additional command line options to MPC.  The value of this setting will be prepended to
                 the options passed to <b>mwc-ace</b> or <b>mpc-ace</b>

       <b>default_type</b>
                 provide a single project type (as specified by the -type option) as the default project type

       <b>dynamic_types</b>
                 this  comma  separated  list points to directories in which MPC will search for Perl modules to
                 implement additional MPC project types, base projects or template files.  This setting  can  be
                 used  to  augment  or replace functionality in MPC.  For each suitable directory found, it will
                 add a <b>modules</b> include path for Perl to find modules, add a <b>config</b> include path to  locate  base
                 projects and a <b>template</b>               include path to find MPC templates.

       <b>includes</b>  similar  to  the -include command line option, it adds the list of comma separated paths to the
                 MPC include search paths.

       logging   if this setting contains <b>info=1</b>, informational  messages  will  be  printed.   If  it  contains
                 <b>warn=1</b>,  warning  messages will be printed.  If it contains <b>diag=1</b>, diagnostic messages will be
                 printed.  If it contains <b>debug=1</b>, debug messages will be printed.  And lastly, if  it  contains
                 <b>detail=1</b>,  detail  messages  will  be  printed.  If it contains none of these, <b>mpc-ace</b> will not
                 print out any information or warnings when  processing  projects  or  workspaces.   Errors  are
                 always printed if any are encountered.

       verbose_ordering
                 if  this  is  set, <b>mwc-ace</b> will warn the user about references to projects in the <b>after</b> keyword
                 that have not been processed

   <b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b>
       The following environment variable could affect <b>mwc-ace</b> and <b>mpc-ace</b>:

       MPC_DEPENDENCY_COMBINED_STATIC_LIBRARY
                 see the help on <b>-static</b> parameter above

       MPC_GHS_UNIX
                 this environment variable is only  meaningful  when  generating  the  ghs  project  files.   By
                 default,  the  ghs  type  assumes  that  it  is for Windows.  If this is not the case, set this
                 environment variable prior to running MPC

                                                                                                          <u><a href="../man1/MPC.1.html">MPC</a></u>(1)
