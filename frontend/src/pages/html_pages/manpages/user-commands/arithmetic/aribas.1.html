</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       aribas - Multiprecision Arithmetic Interpreter

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>aribas</b> [<u>options</u>] [&lt;<u>ari-file</u>&gt; [&lt;<u>arg1</u>&gt; &lt;<u>arg2</u>&gt; ...]]

       This man page was written for Debian since the original software did not contain a man page.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Aribas</b>  is  an  interactive  interpreter  suitable for big integer arithmetic and multiprecision floating
       point arithmetic.  It has a syntax similar to Pascal or Modula-2, but contains also features  from  other
       programming languages like C, Lisp, Oberon.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The  simplest way to use <b>aribas</b> is as a calculator for (big integer) arithmetic. After <b>aribas</b> is started,
       it displays a prompt <b>==&gt;</b> and is ready to accept input. Simply enter the expression you want to calculate,
       followed by a full stop, and then press RETURN, for example

           ==&gt; 123 + 456*789.

       <b>Aribas</b> answers

           -: 359907

       The symbol <b>-:</b> introduces the result.
       <b>IMPORTANT.</b>  To mark the end of your input, you must always type a full stop '.'  and then press RETURN.

       You can assign the result of a calculation to a variable, as in

           ==&gt; F6 := 2**64 + 1.
           -: 18446_74407_37095_51617

       This calculates the 6th Fermat number (<b>**</b> denotes exponentiation) and assigns it to the variable <b>F6</b> (note
       that <b>aribas</b> is case sensitive, so this is not the same as <b>f6</b>).  Later  you  can  use  this  variable  for
       example in the expression

           ==&gt; 123**(F6 - 1) mod F6.
           -: 688_66214_58712_63971

       which shows (by Fermat's theorem) that F6 is not a prime number.
       The  three  most  recent  results  are stored in the pseudo variables <b>_</b>, <b>__</b>, and <b>___</b>. For example you can
       store the last result in the variable x by the command

           ==&gt; x := _.
           -: 688_66214_58712_63971

       As you can see in the above examples, <b>aribas</b> uses the  underscore  <b>_</b>  to  structure  the  output  of  big
       integers  (&gt;=  2**32).  Also for input of integers you may use the underscore, the only condition is that
       immediately before and after the underscore there are digits, example:

           ==&gt; z := 123_4567_890.
           -: 1234567890

       Here the output contains no underscore, which shows that z is less than 2**32.

       <b>Aribas</b> has several built-in functions for factorization, for example <u>rho_factorize</u>, which uses  Pollard's
       rho algorithm.

           ==&gt; rho_factorize(F6).

           working ..
           factor found after 512 iterations

           -: 274177

       To find the remaining cofactor, give the command

           ==&gt; x := F6 div _.
           -: 6728_04213_10721

       To test whether this factor is prime, Rabin's probabilistic test <u>rab_primetest</u> can be applied:

           ==&gt; rab_primetest(x).
           -: true

       The  function  <u>rho_factorize</u>  is  good  for finding small factors (say up to 10 decimal digits); for more
       complicated factorization tasks a more powerful algorithm like the quadratic sieve <u>qs_factorize</u> should be
       used

           ==&gt; qs_factorize(2**128+1).

       (Depending on the power of your computer, it will take a few seconds up to a few minutes to get  a  prime
       factor of the 7th Fermat number.)

   <b>Control</b> <b>structures</b>
       The  <u>for</u>  loop  and  the  <u>while</u>  loop  in <b>aribas</b> have a syntax as in Modula-2. For example, the following
       command sequence calculates the factorial of 100.

           ==&gt; x := 1;
               for i := 2 to 100 do
                   x := x*i;
               end;
               x.

       As you can see in this example, the input may extend over several lines.

       The above <u>for</u> loop is equivalent to the following <u>while</u> loop

           ==&gt; x := 1; i := 2;
               while i &lt;= 100 do
                   x := x*i;
                   inc(i);
               end;
               x.

       The branching construct
       <b>if</b> <u>...</u>  <b>then</b> <u>...</u>  <b>elsif</b> <u>...</u>  <b>else</b> <u>...</u>  <b>end</b>
       has also the same syntax as in Modula-2.

   <b>Multiprecision</b> <b>floating</b> <b>point</b> <b>arithmetic</b>
       <b>Aribas</b> supports different types of floating point numbers which are internally represented with mantissas
       of different bit-length:

               single_float    32 bits
               double_float    64 bits
               long_float     128 bits

       and several higher precisions up to an implementation dependent limit, typically 1024 or 5120 bits, which
       can be determined by the function <u>max_floatprec()</u>. By default, when calculating with numbers of data type
       <u>real</u>, single_floats are used. This corresponds to a precision of 9 to 10 decimal places.  A precision  of
       5120 bits corresponds to over 1500 decimal places.

       The  precision  can be changed using the function <u>set_floatprec</u>. The function takes one integer argument,
       which is the desired precision in bits. It is automatically rounded to the next higher  available  value.
       For example, after

           ==&gt; <a href="../man100/set_floatprec.100.html">set_floatprec</a>(100).
           -: 128

       the floating point precision is 128 bits and you can calculate

           ==&gt; arctan(<a href="../man3/sqrt.3.html">sqrt</a>(3)).
           -: 1.04719_75511_96597_74615_42144_61093_16762_8

           ==&gt; _/pi.
           -: 0.33333_33333_33333_33333_33333_33333_33333_33

   <b>User</b> <b>defined</b> <b>functions</b>
       The user can define his or her own functions. A typical example looks like

           ==&gt; function fac(n: integer): integer;
               var
                   x,i: integer;
               begin
                   x := 1;
                   for i := 2 to n do
                       x := x*i;
                   end;
                   return x;
               end.

       If you have entered this correctly, <b>aribas</b> echoes the function name

           -: fac

       and from now on you can use <u>fac</u> in the same way as a built-in function, e.g.

           ==&gt; <a href="../man32/fac.32.html">fac</a>(32).
           -: 2_63130_83693_36935_30167_21801_21600_00000

       Note  that  inside  function  definitions  all used variables must be explicitly declared, whereas on top
       level of the <b>aribas</b> interpreter variables can be simply created by assignments. Here is another  example,
       which shows some other data types supported by <b>aribas</b>:

           ==&gt; function sqrt_list(n: integer): array of real;
               var
                   vec: array[n] of real;
                   i: integer;
               begin
                   for i := 1 to n do
                       vec[i-1] := sqrt(i);
                   end;
                   return vec;
               end.

       This function returns an array of the square roots of the integers from 1 to n, for example

           ==&gt; <a href="../man10/sqrt_list.10.html">sqrt_list</a>(10).
           -: (1.00000000, 1.41421356, 1.73205081, 2.00000000,
           2.23606798, 2.44948974, 2.64575131, 2.82842712, 3.00000000,
           3.16227766)

       In a bigger programming project where you need several functions you would not enter them directly at the
       <b>aribas</b>  prompt  but prepare the function definitions with an external text editor and save them in a file
       with the extension <b>.ari</b> , for example <b>abcd.ari</b> . This file can then be loaded by <b>aribas</b> using the command

           ==&gt; load("abcd").

       If there is a syntax error in the file, you get an error message of the form

           error in line &lt;= 23 of loaded file
           if: end expected

       which tells you (in this example) that there is an error in the <b>if</b> construct in line 23 or earlier in the
       file. (Note that the error messages are sometimes not very precise.) You can then correct the  error  and
       load the file again.

   <b>Online</b> <b>help</b>
       The command

           ==&gt; symbols(aribas).

       returns  a  list  of  all  keywords  and  names  of builtin functions of <b>aribas</b>.  This list has about 200
       entries, and begins and ends as follows:

       (ARGV, _, __, ___, abs, alloc, and, arccos, arcsin, arctan, arctan2, aribas, array,  atof,  atoi,  begin,
       binary,  bit_and,  bit_clear, bit_length, ...... , tolower, toupper, transcript, true, trunc, type, user,
       var, version, while, write, write_block, write_byte, writeln)

       For most of the symbols in this list, you can get a short online help  using  the  function  <u>help()</u>.  For
       example, the command

           ==&gt; help(ARGV).

       gives an information on the builtin variable <u>ARGV</u>, whereas

           ==&gt; help(while).

       describes  the  syntax  of the <u>while</u> loop. If you need more information than that contained in the online
       help, consult the documentation which can be found in <u>/usr/share/doc/aribas</u>.

   <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>exit</b>
       To end an <b>aribas</b> session, type <u>exit</u> at the <b>aribas</b> prompt

           ==&gt; exit

       and then press the RETURN (ENTER) key.

       If you don't want to leave <b>aribas</b>, but want to break out of an infinite loop or a calculation that  lasts
       too  long,  type CONTROL-C (if you are running <b>aribas</b> from within Emacs, you must press CONTROL-C twice).
       This will (in most cases) stop the current calculation and return to the <b>aribas</b> prompt.

       When you are not using the Emacs interface but the command line version of <b>aribas</b>, you sometimes get into
       the following situation: Some previous line contains a typing error, but you cannot return to  that  line
       to correct it.  In this case you should simply type a full stop '<b>.</b>' , followed by RETURN. You will get an
       error message which you can safely ignore, and a new prompt <b>==&gt;</b> appears, allowing you to try again.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>aribas</b> [<u>options</u>] [&lt;<u>ari-file</u>&gt; [&lt;<u>arg1</u>&gt; &lt;<u>arg2</u>&gt; ...]]

   <b>options</b>
       The following options are available:

       <b>-q</b>     (quiet  mode)  Suppresses  all  messages  to  the screen (version no, copyright notice, etc.) when
              <b>aribas</b> is started

       <b>-v</b>     (verbose mode, default) Does not suppress messages to the screen when <b>aribas</b> is started.

       <b>-c</b> <b>&lt;cols&gt;</b>
              <b>aribas</b> does its own line breaking when writing to the  screen.   Normally  it  supposes  that  the
              screen (or the window in which <b>aribas</b> runs) has 80 columns. With the -c option you can set another
              number,  which  must  be  between 40 and 160 (in decimal representation).  For example, if you run
              <b>aribas</b> in an Xterm window with 72 columns, use the option -c72 (or -c 72, the space between -c and
              the number is optional).

       <b>-m</b> <b>&lt;mem&gt;</b>
              Here &lt;mem&gt; is a number (in decimal representation) between 500 and 32000.  This  number  indicates
              how  many Kilobytes of RAM <b>aribas</b> should use for the <b>aribas</b> heap. The default value depends on the
              options used when <b>aribas</b> was  compiled.  Typically,  under  UNIX  or  LINUX  it  is  6  Megabytes,
              corresponding to -m6000

       <b>-h</b> <b>&lt;path</b> <b>of</b> <b>help</b> <b>file&gt;</b>
              The  online  help of <b>aribas</b> depends on a file aribas.hlp which should be situated  in the range of
              the environment variable PATH. If this is not the case you can specify the exact path of the  help
              file  with  the  -h option. If for example the file aribas.hlp is in the directory <a href="file:/usr/local/lib">/usr/local/lib</a>,
              use the option -h <a href="file:/usr/local/lib">/usr/local/lib</a> (the space after -h is not necessary).  The -h option can also be
              used if the help file has a different name. If the help file is named help-aribas and lies in  the
              directory /home/joe/ari, use -h/home/joe/ari/help-aribas.

              With a properly installed Debian package of <b>aribas</b> it should not be necessary to use this option.

       <b>-p</b> <b>&lt;ari-search-path&gt;</b>
              With  this  option  you can specify a search path for loading files with <b>aribas</b> source code. &lt;ari-
              search-path&gt; may be either the (absolute) pathname of one directory or several pathnames separated
              by colons.  Suppose that you have called <b>aribas</b> with the option

                   -p/usr/local/lib/aribas:<a href="file:~/ari/examples">~/ari/examples</a>

              and that your home directory is /home/alice/. Then the command

                   ==&gt; load("factor").

              will  search  the  file  factor.ari  first  in  the  current  directory,  then  in  the  directory
              /usr/local/lib/aribas and finally in /home/alice/ari/examples.

       <b>-b</b>     Batch mode when loading an <b>aribas</b> source code file from the command line, see below.

       One letter options which require no arguments may be merged, for example

           aribas -q -b

       is equivalent to

           aribas -qb

   <b>Further</b> <b>command</b> <b>line</b> <b>arguments</b>
       <b>&lt;ari-file&gt;</b>
              The  next command line argument after the options is interpreted as the name of a file with <b>aribas</b>
              source code. If the file name has the extension .ari, this extension may be omitted. The  file  is
              loaded as if the command <u>load("&lt;ari-file&gt;")</u> had been given after the start of <b>aribas</b> at the <b>aribas</b>
              prompt.  If  the  file  is  not  found  in the current directory it is searched in the directories
              specified by the -p option.  If the option  -b  was  given,  the  file  is  loaded  and  executed.
              Afterwards  <b>aribas</b>  exits  without  showing  it's  prompt. If the file cannot be loaded completely
              because of an error, <b>aribas</b> exits immediately after the error message.

       <b>&lt;arg1&gt;</b> <b>&lt;arg2&gt;</b> <b>...</b>
              When further command line arguments follow <u>&lt;ari-file&gt;</u>, they are collected  (as  strings)  together
              with <u>&lt;ari-file&gt;</u> in the vector <u>ARGV</u> which can be accessed from within <b>aribas</b>.  Example: If you call
              <b>aribas</b> with the command line

                   aribas startup 4536 eisenstein

              and  the current directory contains the file startup.ari, then <b>aribas</b> loads it and the vector <u>ARGV</u>
              has the form

                  ==&gt; ARGV.
                  -: ("startup", "4536", "eisenstein")

              If you need some arguments as numbers and not as strings, you  can  transform  them  by  <u>atoi</u>  (or
              <u>atof</u>); in our example

                  ==&gt; x := atoi(ARGV[1]).
                  -: 4536

              will do it. The length of the vector <u>ARGV</u> can be determined by <u>length(ARGV)</u>.

</pre><h4><b>RUNNING</b> <b>ARIBAS</b> <b>WITHIN</b> <b>EMACS</b></h4><pre>
       You can run <b>aribas</b> from within Emacs by giving the command (in Emacs' minibuffer)

              M-x run-aribas

       (If  you don't have a META key, use ESC x instead of M-x) Then <b>aribas</b> will be loaded into an Emacs window
       with name *aribas* and you can edit your input to <b>aribas</b> with the usual Emacs commands.

       If your input ends with a full stop '.' and you press RETURN, it is sent  to  <b>aribas</b>.   If  however  your
       complete input does not end with a full stop, (for example in response to a <u>readln</u>), the input is sent to
       <b>aribas</b> by C-j (Control-j) or C-c RETURN.

       If you want to repeat a previous input, M-p (or ESC p) cycles backward through input history, and M-n (or
       ESC n) cycles forward.

       A Control-C is sent to <b>aribas</b> by C-c C-c (press C-c twice).

       It is also possible to start <b>aribas</b> from Emacs with command line arguments. For this purpose the command

              C-u M-x run-aribas

       has to be given. Then a prompt

              run-aribas: aribas

       appears in the Minibuffer of Emacs and you can complete the command line, for example

              run-aribas: aribas startup 4536 eisenstein

       (see above).

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       Options  for  running  <b>aribas</b>  can be specified also using a configuration file with name <b>.arirc</b>.  <b>Aribas</b>
       searches for a configuration file in the following order:

           1) the current directory
           2) the home directory of the user

       There is a third possibility: You can define an environment variable <b>ARIRC</b> containing  the  name  of  the
       configuration file (which may be different from .arirc), including the full path.

       In  the  configuration file you can specify all command line options described above which begin with a -
       sign, however a separate line must be used for every single option. Lines beginning with the character  #
       or  empty  lines  are  ignored.   In  addition to the options described above, the configuration file may
       contain <b>aribas</b> source code. For this purpose there must be a line reading

       <b>-init</b>

       Then everything after this line is treated as <b>aribas</b> source code and executed when <b>aribas</b> is started.

       The existence of a configuration file for <b>aribas</b> does not exclude the possibility to  give  command  line
       arguments.  If an option (e.g. the -m option) is specified both in the configuration file and the command
       line but with different values, then the specification at the command line is valid.  Analogously,  a  -v
       option  on  the  command line overrides a -q option in the configuration file.  If there is -init code in
       the configuration file and an &lt;ari-file&gt; argument at the command line, then the -init  code  is  executed
       first and afterwards the &lt;ari-file&gt; is loaded and its code executed.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>$ARIRC,</b> <b>.arirc,</b> <b>$HOME/.arirc</b>

              Optional configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
