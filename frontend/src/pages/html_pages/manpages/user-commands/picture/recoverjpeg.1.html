       recoverjpeg - recover jpeg pictures from a filesystem image

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       recoverjpeg [<u>options</u>] <u>device</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Recoverjpeg  tries to identify jpeg pictures from a filesystem image.  To achieve this goal, it scans the
       filesystem image and looks for a jpeg structure at blocks starting at 512 bytes boundaries.

       Salvaged jpeg pictures are stored by default under the name <u>imageXXXXX.jpg</u> where <u>XXXXX</u> is  a  five  digit
       number starting at zero.  If there are more than 100,000 recovered pictures, recoverjpeg will start using
       six  figures  numbers and more as soon as needed, but the 100,000 first ones will use a five figures num‐
       ber.  Options <u>-f</u> and <u>-i</u> can override this behaviour.

       <b>recoverjpeg</b> stores the recovered pictures into the current directory.  If you want it to store them else‐
       where, just go to the directory you want <b>recoverjpeg</b> to save the images into (using the <b>cd</b> command at the
       shell prompt) and start <b>recoverjpeg</b> from there, or use the <u>-o</u> option.

       Note that <u>device</u> is not necessarily a physical device.  It may also be a file containing a  copy  of  the
       faulty  device  in order to reduce the actual processing time and the stress imposed to an already defec‐
       tive hardware.  <b><a href="../man1/dd.1.html">dd</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man1/ddrescue.1.html">ddrescue</a></b>(1) may be used to create such a working copy.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -h     Display an help message.

       -b <u>blocksize</u>
              Set the size of blocks in bytes.  On most file systems, setting it to 512 (the default) will  work
              fine  as  any  large  file  will  be stored on 512 bytes boundaries.  Setting it to 1 maximize the
              chances of finding very small files if the filesystems aggregates them (UFS for  example)  at  the
              expense of a much longer running time.

       -d <u>formatstring</u>
              Set  the directory format string (printf-style, default: use the current directory).  When used, 0
              will be used for the 100 first images, 1 for the 100 next images, and so on.  The goal of this op‐
              tion is to circumvent the directory size limit imposed by some file systems.

       -f <u>formatstring</u>
              Set the file name format string (printf-style, default: “image%05d.jpg”).  It is used with the im‐
              age index as an integer argument.

       -i <u>integerindex</u>
              Set the initial index value for image numbering (default: 0).

       -m <u>maxsize</u>
              Maximum size of extract jpeg files.  If a file would be larger than that, it  is  discarded.   The
              default is 6 MiB.

       -o <u>directory</u>
              Change  the working directory before restoring files.  Use this option to restore files into a di‐
              rectory with enough space instead of the current directory.  This option can be repeated.

       -q     Be quiet and do not display anything.

       -r <u>readsize</u>
              Set the readsize in bytes.  By default, this is 128 MiB.  Using a large readsize reduces the  num‐
              ber of system calls but consumes more memory.  The readsize will automatically be adjusted to be a
              multiple of the system page size.  It <b>must</b> be greater than the <u>maxsize</u> parameter.

       -s <u>cutoffsize</u>
              Set the cutoff size in bytes.  Files smaller than that will be ignored.

       -S <u>skipsize</u>
              Set the number of bytes to skip at the beginning of the filesystem image.  This can be used to re‐
              sume  an  interrupted session, in conjunction with <u>-i</u>.  The number of bytes may be rounded down to
              be a multiple of a memory page size in order to improve performances.

       -v     Be verbose and describes the process of jpeg identification.  By default,  if  this  flag  is  not
              used,  recoverjpeg will print a progress bar showing how much it has analyzed already and how many
              jpeg pictures have been recovered.

       -V     Display program version and exit.

       All the sizes may be suffixed by a <u>k</u>, <u>m</u>, <u>g</u>, or <u>t</u> letter to indicate KiB, MiB, GiB, or TiB.  For  example,
       6m correspond to 6 MiB (6291456 bytes).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Recover as many pictures as possible from the memory card located in <b>/dev/sdc</b>:

              recoverjpeg /dev/sdc

       Do the same thing but ignore files smaller than one megabyte:

              recoverjpeg -s 1m /dev/sdc

       Recover  as  many  pictures  as  possible from a crashed ReiserFS file system (which does not necessarily
       store pictures at block boundaries) in <b>/dev/sdb1</b>:

              recoverjpeg -b 1 /dev/sdb1

       Do the same thing in a memory constrained environment where no more than 16MB of RAM can be used for  the
       operation:

              recoverjpeg -b 1 -r 16m /dev/sdb1

       (please  send  only 800x600 versions of the pictures) and authorize me to put them online (indicate which

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Recoverjpeg does not include a complete jpeg parser.  You may need to  use  sort-pictures  afterwards  to
       identify  bogus pictures.  Some pictures may be corrupted but have a correct structure; in this case, the
       image may be garbled.  There is no automated way to detect those pictures with a 100% success rate.
