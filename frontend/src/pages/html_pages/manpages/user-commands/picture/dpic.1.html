       <b>dpic</b> <b>[</b> <b>-defghmprstvx</b> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <b>-z</b> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <u>infile</u> <b>]</b> <b>[&gt;</b> <u>outfile</u> <b>]</b>

       Typically, <u>infile</u> is of the form <u>name</u> <b>[.pic]</b> and <u>outfile</u> is of
       the form <u>name</u> <b>.[tex|eps|pdf|fig|mp|svg]</b>

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>(none)</b> LaTeX picture-environment output (very limited font‐based drawing commands)
       <b>-d</b> PDF output, basic strings
       <b>-e</b> pict2e output
       <b>-f</b> Postscript output, strings in psfrag format
       <b>-g</b> TikZ‐pgf output
       <b>-h</b> write help message and quit
       <b>-m</b> mfpic output (see mfpic documentation)
       <b>-p</b> PSTricks output
       <b>-r</b> raw Postscript output, no automatic string formatting
       <b>-s</b> MetaPost output
       <b>-t</b> eepicemu output (slightly less limited than LaTeX picture output)
       <b>-v</b> svg output
       <b>-x</b> xfig 3.2 output
       <b>-z</b> safe mode (access to external files disabled)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Dpic  accepts  a  tight  subset of the pic drawing language accepted by GNU pic (sometimes named gpic) or
       AT&amp;T pic, and emits lower‐level drawing commands for insertion into LaTeX documents,  for  processing  by
       the xfig or Inkscape drawing tools, or for direct display as encapsulated Postscript, PDF, or SVG. LaTeX-
       compatible  output  can  contain  arbitrary  text  for  formatting.  Commands to be passed through to the
       postprocessor (PSTricks, Tikz‐pgf, etc.)  can be included.  Dpic returns  EXIT_SUCCESS  (normally  0)  if
       messages no more severe than warnings were generated, otherwise EXIT_FAILURE (normally 1).

       A few pic-language extensions unique to dpic are implemented for specific purposes.

</pre><h4><b>LANGUAGE</b> <b>SUMMARY</b></h4><pre>
       Input  consists  of  a  sequence  of ASCII text lines.  The characters <b>LF</b> (\n) and <b>CR</b> (\r) have identical
       effect, and <b>ETX</b> (\003) is reserved for internal use.  Characters outside  the  range  of  0  to  127  are
       allowed in strings but receive no special treatment.

       The  first line of a picture is <b>.PS</b> and the last is <b>.PE,</b> with lines between these two converted into low‐
       level drawing commands for the postprocessor chosen by the option.  Lines outside of  <b>.PS</b>  <b>...</b>  <b>.PE</b>  pass
       through dpic unchanged.

   <b>Coordinates</b>
       Coordinate  axes  in the pic language point to the right and up.  The drawing units are inches by default
       but the statement

         <b>scale</b> <b>=</b> <b>25.4</b>

       at the beginning of the diagram has the effect of changing the units to millimetres.

   <b>Drawn</b> <b>objects</b>
       The primitive drawn objects consist of the planar objects <b>box,</b> <b>circle,</b> <b>ellipse;</b> the linear objects  <b>line,</b>
       <b>arrow,</b>  <b>move,</b> <b>spline;</b> and <b>arc,</b> which has characteristics of both planar and linear objects.  A <u>block</u> is a
       pair of square brackets enclosing other objects: <b>[</b> <u>anything</u> <b>]</b> and  is  a  planar  object.   The  complete
       diagram is contained implicitly in a block.

       A  <u>string</u> is a planar object similar to a box, but the pic language also allows strings to be attached to
       other objects as overlays, in which case they are part of the object.

       The current drawing position <b>Here</b> is always defined.  Initially and at the beginning of a block, <b>Here</b>  is
       0,0.   Similarly,  the  current  direction,  which  can  be any of <b>up,</b> <b>down,</b> <b>left,</b> <b>right,</b> is set as <b>right</b>
       initially.

       Each drawn object has an entry point and exit point that depend on  the  current  direction.   The  entry
       point  is  placed by default at the current position.  Objects can also be placed explicitly with respect
       to absolute coordinates or relative to other objects.  The exit point becomes the new current position.

   <b>Labels</b>
       A <u>label</u> in pic is an alphameric sequence that starts with an uppercase letter.  Dpic allows variables and
       labels to be subscripted; thus <b>T</b> and <b>T[5]</b> are  distinct  labels.   The  value  in  brackets  can  be  any
       expression,  comma-separated  expression  pair, or a defined position, but expressions are rounded to the
       nearest integer value.  A label gives a symbolic name to a position or drawn object; for example,

          <b>Post:</b> <b>Here</b> <b>+</b> <b>(1,2)</b>
          <b>Bus[23]:</b> <b>line</b> <b>right</b> <b>4</b>

   <b>Defined</b> <b>points</b>
       Once drawn, a linear object has defined points <b>.start,</b> <b>.center,</b> and <b>.end,</b>  which  can  be  referenced  as
       known positions, for example,

          <b>L:</b> <b>line;</b> <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>0.5</b> <b>from</b> <b>L.c</b>

       where <b>.center</b> has been abbreviated as <b>.c</b>

       The  defined  points for a planar object are the compass points on its periphery given by <b>.n,</b> <b>.s,</b> <b>.e,</b> <b>.w,</b>
       <b>.nw,</b> <b>.ne,</b> <b>.se,</b> <b>.sw,</b> together with <b>.center,</b> <b>.top,</b> <b>.bottom,</b>  <b>.right,</b>  <b>.left.</b>   For  an  arc,  these  points
       correspond to the circle of which the arc is a part, with the addition of <b>.start</b> and <b>.end.</b>

       A <u>block</u> has defined points similar to a box, but can also have others in its interior.  For the example

          <b>A:</b> <b>[</b> <b>circle;</b> <b>Q:</b> <b>[</b> <b>line;</b> <b>circle</b> <b>];</b> <b>T:</b> <b>Q.n</b> <b>]</b>

       the defined points are as follows:

          The points of the outer block as if it were a box, for
          example, <b>A.ne</b>

          A position defined in the block, for example, <b>A.T</b>

          The defined points of labeled objects inside the block,
          preceded by a dot, for example, <b>A.Q</b> (the centre of
          block <b>Q),</b> or <b>A.Q.ne</b> (the northeast point of <b>Q).</b>

          The defined points of enumerated objects inside the
          block, preceded by a dot (but make sure there is a space
          after the dot if it is followed by a number rather than
          an expression in braces), for example, <b>A.Q.</b> <b>1st</b> <b>circle.n</b>
          or (better) <b>A.Q.{1}st</b> <b>circle.n</b>

   <b>Language</b> <b>elements</b>
       The lines defining a picture are separated by newline characters or semicolons.  Newlines are significant
       except after <b>then,</b> <b>;,</b> <b>:,</b> <b>{,</b> <b>else,</b> or newline.

       A line is continued to the next if the rightmost character is a backslash.

       Non-continuation lines beginning with a period are ignored, except for <b>.PS</b> and <b>.PE</b> lines.

       The pic source may be commented by placing each comment to the right of a <b>#</b> character (unless the <b>#</b> is in
       a string).

       The language elements include the following:

          A drawing command with optional label, for example, <b>box</b> or <b>A:</b> <b>box</b>

          A position‐label definition, for example <b>A:</b> <u>position</u>

          An assignment to a variable, for example <b>x</b> <b>=</b> <b>5</b>

          A <u>direction</u> (to change the default), for example, <b>up</b>

       Branching is performed by

          <b>if</b> <u>expr</u> <b>then</b> <b>{</b> <u>dotrue</u> <b>}</b> <b>else</b> <b>{</b> <u>dofalse</u> <b>}.</b>

       The looping facility is

          <b>for</b> <u>variable</u> <b>=</b> <u>expr</u> <b>to</b> <u>expr</u> <b>[by</b> <b>[*]</b> <u>incr</u> <b>]</b> <b>do</b> <b>{</b> <u>anything</u> <b>}.</b>

       The  loop variable is incremented by 1 by default, otherwise by <u>incr</u> (which may be a negative expression)
       unless it is preceded by the asterisk, in which case the loop variable is multiplied by <u>incr.</u>   The  loop
       variable may be changed by statements in the loop, thereby controlling the number of loop repetitions.

       Braces occur in several contexts.  When used independently of other language elements, as

          <b>{</b> <u>anything</u> <b>}</b>

       the  left  brace saves the current position and direction, and the right brace restores them to the saved
       values after the enclosed lines have been processed.

       Arbitrary postprocessor commands can be generated using

          <b>command</b> <u>string,</u>

       which inserts the contents of <u>string</u> into the output.  The <u>string</u> contents must be  compatible  with  the
       chosen  postprocessor.   Similarly,  any  line  that  begins  with a backslash is copied literally to the
       output.

       The line

          <b>exec</b> <u>string</u>

       executes the contents of <u>string</u> as if it were a normal input line.

       To execute operating-system shell commands, use

          <b>sh</b> <u>string</u>

       and to read lines from an external file, use

          <b>copy</b> <u>string</u>

       These commands are disabled by the dpic option <b>-z</b> or by a compile‐time switch.

       The command

          <b>print</b> <u>expr|position|string</u> <b>[</b> <b>&gt;</b> <u>string</u> <b>|</b> <b>&gt;&gt;</b> <u>string</u> <b>]</b>

       prints or appends its argument to the file named in the string  on  the  right,  or  by  default  to  the
       standard error.  Printing to a file is disabled by the -z option.

   <b>Macros</b>
       The pic language includes macro definition and expansion, using either

          <b>define</b> <u>name</u> <b>{</b> <u>anything</u> <b>},</b>

       or

          <b>define</b> <u>name</u> <b>X</b> <u>anything</u> <b>X,</b>

       where  X is any character except {. When <u>name</u> appears alone or with arguments in parentheses as <u>name(arg,</u>
       <u>...)</u>  then it is replaced by the contents between the delimiters in the macro definition.  Arguments  are
       separated  by  commas  except  that  a  comma  in an argument is ignored within a string, parentheses, or
       brackets.  In this substitution, occurrences of <b>$1</b> are replaced literally by the first argument  (not  by
       its value, if any), and so on for other arguments.

       The value <b>$+</b> in a macro is the number of arguments given to the macro.  dpic ignores white space (spaces,
       new  lines,  and  tab  characters)  that  directly  precede  an  argument in a macro invocation.  A macro
       definition can be deleted by

          <b>undefine</b> <u>name</u>

       Macro definitions are global, which may require judicious undefinition of macros if there is  a  risk  of
       name clashes.

   <b>Drawing</b> <b>commands</b>
       An object is drawn using the following general format:

        <b>[</b> <u>Label</u> <b>:]</b> <u>object</u> <b>[</b> <u>attributes</u> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <u>placement</u> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <u>strings</u> <b>]</b>

       The  items  following  <u>object</u>  can  occur  in any order, but the order can make a difference to the drawn
       result, since lines are read and interpreted from left to right.  Defaults are assumed  for  all  drawing
       parameters as necessary.  For example, the sequence

          <b>circle</b> <b>"Chew";</b> <b>arrow;</b> <b>box</b> <b>"Swallow"</b>
          <b>line;</b> <b>arc</b> <b>cw</b> <b>-&gt;;</b> <b>ellipse</b> <b>"Digest"</b>

       draws  a simple flow diagram using default sizes for all objects, with centered words in the circle, box,
       and ellipse.

   <b>Attributes</b>
       An <u>attribute</u> is a keyword or keywords followed by expressions as appropriate.  Attributes are used to set
       parameters that control the placement, size, and appearance of objects.

       The dimension attributes are the following, showing valid abbreviations:

          <b>height|ht|width|wid|radius|rad|diameter|diam|scaled</b> <u>expr</u>

       When appended to linear objects, <b>height</b> and <b>width</b> apply to arrowhead dimensions.   The  <b>scaled</b>  attribute
       scales the object by <u>expr.</u>

       The  postprocessed  size  of  a  string  is  unknown in advance to the pic processor, but once known, the
       bounding box dimensions can be specified explicitly as for other drawn objects, as shown:

          <u>string</u> <b>wid</b> <u>expr</u> <b>ht</b> <u>expr</u>

       The thickness of lines defining an object are modified using the environment variable  <b>linethick</b>  or  the
       attribute

          <b>thickness|thick</b> <u>expr</u>

       expressed in points.  Line thickness is independent of any scaling.

       Solid lines are drawn by default; this can be modified with

          <b>solid|invisible|invis</b>

       or with

          <b>dotted|dashed</b> <b>[</b> <u>expr</u> <b>]</b>

       the optional expression in the latter setting the length and distance between dashes or dots.

       The following attributes are for putting arrowheads at the start, end, or both ends of a linear object:

          <b>&lt;-|-&gt;|&lt;-&gt;</b> <b>[</b> <u>expr</u> <b>]</b>

       The default for <b>arrow</b> objects is <b>-&gt;.</b>  The shape parameter <u>expr</u> may be omitted, in which case the value of
       the  environment variable <b>arrowhead</b> is used.  The accepted values of expr are currently 0, 1, and 3, with
       1 the default.

       The drawing direction of an arc is changed by the attribute

          <b>ccw|cw</b>

       with <b>ccw</b> the default.

       To fill an object with a shade of gray, use the attribute

          <b>fill</b> <b>[</b> <u>expr</u> <b>]</b>

       where the value of <u>expr</u> can vary from 1, meaning white, to 0, meaning black.  A linear object defining  a
       path  can  be  filled  where  the postprocessor allows, currently for MFpic, MPost, PDF, PGF, PS, PSfrag,
       PSTricks, and SVG output.

       Line color can be set using

          <b>outline|outlined</b> <u>string</u>

       The pic language knows no  details  about  color;  the  string  contents  must  be  compatible  with  the
       postprocessor.   For  example,  the predefined colours of LaTeX or Tikz‐pdf packages can be specified, or
       custom colors can be defined using the

          <b>command</b> <u>string</u>

       facility so that the postprocessor will know about them.

       Filling by color is similar, using the attribute

          <b>shaded</b> <u>string</u>

       and, when the object is planar and both the fill and outline colors are the same, the two attributes  can
       be combined as

          <b>colour|color|colored|coloured</b> <u>string</u>

       in which all four spellings are equivalent.

       Finally, the attribute

          <b>same</b>

       duplicates  the  properties of the previously drawn object of the same type, but with the current default
       placement.

       In addition to scale changes effected by the <b>scale</b> variable, the size of the complete picture can be  set
       by appending one or two terms to the <b>.PS</b> line as shown:

          <b>.PS</b> [x [y]]

       where  x and y evaluate to constant values.  On encountering the <b>.PE</b> line, the picture width w and height
       h are calculated.  If x &gt; 0 then the picture is scaled so that w = x.  If h &gt; y &gt; 0 or if x = 0 and y &gt; 0
       then the picture is scaled so that h = y.  Horizontal and vertical scaling  are  not  independent.   Text
       size, line thickness, and arrowheads are not scaled.  The units are inches, so for example,

          <b>.PS</b> <b>100/25.4</b>

       sets the final picture width to 100 mm.  Printed string text may extend beyond the rectangular boundaries
       defined by w and h unless the text dimensions have been explicitly set.

       If  the final diagram width exceeds the environment variable <b>maxpswid</b> or the height exceeds <b>maxpsht,</b> both
       of which can be changed by assignment, then the diagram is scaled as for x and y above.

   <b>Placement</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>objects</b>
       An object is placed by default so that its entry is at the current point.

       Explicit placement is obtained with

          <u>object</u> <b>at</b> <u>position</u>

       which centers the object at <u>position,</u> or

          <u>object</u> <b>with</b> <u>defined</u> <u>point</u> <b>at</b> <u>position</u>

       for example,

          <b>arc</b> <b>cw</b> <b>from</b> <u>position</u> <b>to</b> <u>position</u> <b>with</b> <b>.c</b> <b>at</b> <u>position</u>

       A block can also be positioned by reference to a displacement from its lower left corner, for example,

          <b>A:</b> <b>[</b> <u>contents</u> <b>]</b> <b>with</b> <b>(0.5,0.2)</b> <b>at</b> <u>position.</u>

       Linear objects are placed by default with the <b>.start</b>  point  placed  at  the  current  drawing  position;
       otherwise linear objects are defined using a <u>linespec,</u> which is of the form

       <u>linespec</u> <b>=</b> <b>from</b> <u>position</u> <b>|</b> <b>to</b> <u>position</u> <b>|</b> <u>direction</u> <b>[</b> <u>expr</u> <b>]</b>
                 <b>|</b> <u>linespec</u> <u>linespec</u>
                 <b>|</b> <u>linespec</u> <b>then</b> <u>linespec</u>

       where  the  second  line means that <u>linespecs</u> can be concatenated, and the third that multisegment linear
       objects are drawn using multiple <u>linespecs</u> separated by <b>then.</b>

       As an example, the following draws a triangle with the leftmost vertex at the current point:

          <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>2</b> <b>right</b> <b>1.5</b> <b>then</b> <b>down</b> <b>3</b> <b>then</b> <b>to</b> <b>Here</b>

       Exceptionally, the <u>linespec</u>

          <b>to</b> <u>position</u> <b>to</b> <u>position</u> <b>to</b> <b>...</b>

       is multiple and does not require the <b>then</b> keyword, but this also means that the <u>linespec</u>

          <b>up</b> <u>expression</u> <b>to</b> <u>position</u>

       is multiple and creates a two-segment line.

       A single <u>expr</u> is also an acceptable <u>linespec</u> immediately after a linear object and means that the  <u>object</u>
       is drawn to length <u>expr</u> in the current direction.  The exception to this is

          <b>spline</b> <b>[</b> <u>expr</u> <b>]</b> <u>linespec</u>

       for  which  the  <u>expr</u> is a spline tension parameter.  If <u>expr</u> is omitted, a straight line is drawn to the
       midpoint of the first two spline control points and from the midpoint of the last two to the last  point;
       the spline is tangent to all midpoints between control points.  If <u>expr</u> is present, the spline is tangent
       at  the first and last control points and at all other midpoints, and the spline tension can be adjusted.
       Tension values between 0 and 1 are typical.

       In cases where all of the points of a multisegment linear object are not known in advance or inconvenient
       to calculate, the drawing command

          <b>continue</b> <u>linespec</u>

       will append a segment to the  previously  drawn  linear  object  as  if  <b>continue</b>  were  <b>then,</b>  with  two
       differences.   Arbitrary calculations may be done between the previous object and the <b>continue</b> statement,
       and the current point is the exit point of the previous object.

       The construction

          <b>line</b> <b>from</b> <u>position</u> <b>to</b> <u>position</u> <b>chop</b> <b>[</b> <u>expr</u> <b>]</b>

       truncates the line at each end by the value of <u>expr</u> or, if <u>expr</u> is  omitted,  by  the  current  value  of
       environment variable <b>circlerad</b>

       Otherwise

          <b>line</b> <b>from</b> <u>position</u> <b>to</b> <u>position</u> <b>chop</b> <u>expr1</u> <b>chop</b> <u>expr2</u>

       truncates the line by the two specified distances at the ends.  Truncation values can be negative.

       The attribute

          <b>by</b> <u>position</u>

       is for positioning, for example,

          <b>move</b> <b>by</b> <b>(5,6)</b>

   <b>Variables</b> <b>and</b> <b>expressions</b>
       Variable names are alphameric sequences beginning with a lower‐case letter, optionally subscripted as for
       labels, and are defined by assignment.  For example, the following line defines the variable <b>x</b> if it does
       not already exist in the current scope:

          <b>x</b> <b>=</b> <u>expr</u>

       The scope of pic variables is the current block in which they are defined, including blocks defined later
       within the current block.  The assignment

          <b>x</b> <b>:=</b> <u>expr</u>

       or any assignment using an operator in the set

          <b>:=</b> <b>+=</b> <b>-=</b> <b>*=</b> <b>/=</b> <b>%=</b>

       requires <b>x</b> to have been defined previously in the current block or an enclosing block.

       Expressions  consist  of floating‐point values combined using the unary operator "!" for logical negation
       and the usual parentheses and binary operators in decreasing order of precedence:

          <b>^</b>
          <b>*</b> <b>/</b> <b>%</b>
          <b>+</b> <b>-</b>
          <b>==</b> <b>!=</b> <b>&gt;=</b> <b>&lt;=</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>&gt;</b>
          <b>&amp;&amp;</b>
          <b>||</b>

       In logical tests, the value 0 is equivalent to false and a nonzero value to  true,  with  resulting  true
       value of 1.

       A  floating‐point value is obtained as an integer, a number with <b>e</b> syntax, a function value, a size value
       of a drawn object, for example,

          <b>last</b> <b>box.ht,</b>

       or the horizontal or vertical coordinate of a <b>position,</b> obtained respectively as

          <u>position</u> <b>.x|.y</b>

       The single‐argument functions are <b>abs,</b> <b>acos,</b> <b>asin,</b> <b>cos,</b> <b>exp,</b> <b>expe,</b> <b>int,</b> <b>log,</b> <b>loge,</b> <b>sign,</b> <b>sin,</b> <b>sqrt,</b>  <b>tan,</b>
       <b>floor.</b>   The  functions  <b>exp</b> and <b>log</b> are base 10.  The function <b>rand()</b> delivers a random number between 0
       and 1, and <b>rand</b> <u>(expr)</u> initializes the random number generator.

       The two‐argument functions are <b>atan2,</b> <b>max,</b> <b>min,</b> <b>pmod</b> where <b>pmod</b>  is  the  modulo  function  delivering  a
       positive value.

   <b>Predefined</b> <b>variables</b>
       The  following  variables  are predefined on invocation of dpic: <b>optTeX,</b> <b>opttTeX,</b> <b>optPict2e,</b> <b>optPSTricks,</b>
       <b>optPDF,</b> <b>optPGF,</b> <b>optMFpic,</b> <b>optPS,</b> <b>optPSfrag,</b>
       <b>optMpost,</b> and <b>optSVG.</b>  Variable <b>dpicopt</b> is set according to the output option chosen, so that if  one  of
       options <b>-p</b> or <b>-g</b> has been invoked for example, then the test

          <b>if</b> <b>dpicopt</b> <b>==</b> <b>optPSTricks</b> <b>||</b> <b>dpicopt</b> <b>==</b> <b>optPGF</b> <b>then</b> <b>{</b> <b>...</b> <b>}</b>

       will  selectively  execute  its  body statements.  In addition, variable <b>optsafe</b> has value <b>true</b> if the <b>-z</b>
       option has been selected or dpic has been compiled in safe mode.

       If the specified option is one of <b>-v</b>  (SVG),  <b>-d</b>  (PDF),  or  <b>-r</b>  (raw  postscript),  then  the  variable
       <b>dptextratio</b>  is  defined,  with  default  value 0.66, together with the variable <b>dpPPI</b> with default value
       0.96.  The latter is the assumed pixel density per inch and the former is the ratio  of  text  height  to
       nominal point size.  These variables are used by the output routines and can be changed by assignment.

       If  the  <b>-x</b>  (xfig)  option  has been specified, then the following two variables are predefined: <b>xfigres</b>
       (default value 1200), and <b>xdispres</b> (default 80).

   <b>Predefined</b> <b>environment</b> <b>variables</b>
       A set of environment variables establishes the default values of drawing parameters within the  scope  of
       the current block.  Their values are inherited from the superior block, but can be changed by assignment.
       They  can  be used in expressions like other variables.  The variables, their default values, and default
       uses are given below

          <b>arcrad</b>       <b>0.25</b>
          arc radius
          <b>arrowht</b>      <b>0.1</b>
           length of arrowhead
          <b>arrowwid</b>     <b>0.05</b>
          width of arrowhead
          <b>boxht</b>        <b>0.5</b>
           box height
          <b>boxrad</b>       <b>0</b>
              radius of rounded box corners
          <b>boxwid</b>       <b>0.75</b>
          box width
          <b>circlerad</b>    <b>0.25</b> circle radius
          <b>dashwid</b>      <b>0.05</b> dash length for dashed lines
          <b>ellipseht</b>    <b>0.5</b> ellipse height
          <b>ellipsewid</b>   <b>0.75</b> ellipse width
          <b>lineht</b>       <b>0.5</b> height of vertical lines
          <b>linewid</b>      <b>0.5</b> length of horizontal lines
          <b>moveht</b>       <b>0.5</b> length of vertical moves
          <b>movewid</b>      <b>0.5</b> length of horizontal moves
          <b>textht</b>       <b>0</b> assumed height of text (11pt for postscript, PDF, and SVG)
          <b>textoffset</b>   <b>2.5/72</b> text justification gap
          <b>textwid</b>      <b>0</b> assumed width of text

       When a value is assigned to the environment variable <b>scale,</b> all of the above values are multiplied by the
       new value of <b>scale.</b>  This is normally done once at the top of the outermost scope of a diagram.   Drawing
       units  are  thereby  changed  but  the  default  physical  sizes  of drawn objects remain unchanged since
       dimensions are divided by the outermost <b>scale</b> value on output.  The following  are  unaffected  by  <b>scale</b>
       changes:

          <b>arrowhead</b>    <b>1</b> arrowhead shape
          <b>fillval</b>      <b>0.5</b> fill density
          <b>linethick</b>    <b>0.8</b> line thickness in points
          <b>maxpsht</b>      <b>11.5</b> maximum allowed diagram height
          <b>maxpswid</b>     <b>8.5</b> maximum allowed diagram width

       The  variables <b>maxpswid</b> and <b>maxpsht</b> may have to be redefined for large diagrams or landscape figures, for
       example.

   <b>Positions</b>
       A <u>position</u> is equivalent to a coordinate pair defined in current drawing units, and can be  expressed  in
       the following forms:

          <b>Here</b>
          The current drawing position.

           <u>expr,expr</u>
          A pair of expressions separated by a comma.

          <b>(</b> <u>position</u> <b>)</b>
          A position in parentheses for grouping.

          <b>(</b> <u>position</u> <b>,</b> <u>position</u> <b>)</b>
          Takes the horizontal value from the first position and
          the vertical value from the second.

           <u>position</u> <b>+|-</b> <u>position</u>
          Vector addition.

           <u>position</u> <b>*|/</b> <u>expr</u>
          Scalar postmultiplication.

           <u>Label</u>
          The label of a defined position or object.  The position
          is the center of the object.

           <u>expr</u> <b>[of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way]</b> <b>between</b> <u>position</u> <b>and</b> <u>position</u>

          The example <b>x</b> <b>between</b> <b>A</b> <b>and</b> <b>B</b> is equal to <b>A*(1-x)</b> <b>+</b> <b>B*x.</b>
          Any value of <u>expr</u> is allowed.

           <u>expr</u> <b>&lt;</b> <u>position,</u> <u>position</u> <b>&gt;</b>
          An abbreviated equivalent of the previous form.

           <u>number</u> <b>st|rd|nd|th</b> <b>[last]</b> <u>object</u>
          An object within the current block, enumerated in order of definition.

          The <u>object</u> is one of

          <b>line,</b> <b>move,</b> <b>arrow,</b> <b>arc,</b> <b>box,</b> <b>ellipse,</b> <b>circle,</b> <b>spline,</b> <b>[],</b> <b>""</b> <b>.</b>

       The number can be replaced by <b>{</b> <u>expr</u> <b>}.</b>  For example, <b>last</b> <b>""</b> means the last string, and <b>{2^2}nd</b> <b>[]</b> means
       the fourth block in the current scope.  The position is the center of the object.

       Parentheses may be required when composite positions or expressions are used in the above forms.

       Finally, a position can be given as

          <u>object</u> <b>.</b>  <u>defined</u> <u>point</u>

   <b>Strings</b>
       A  <u>string</u>  is a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes.  To include a double quote in a string,
       precede it with a backslash. Strings can be concatenated using the <b>+</b> operator.  The C‐like function

          <b>sprintf(</b> <u>format</u> <u>string,</u> <u>expr,</u> <u>...</u>  <b>)</b>

       is equivalent to a string.  (Its implementation passes arguments singly  to  the  C  snprintf  function.)
       Expressions are floating‐point values, so the only applicable number formats are <b>e,</b> <b>f,</b> and <b>g.</b>

       Multiple strings such as <u>"text1"</u> <u>"text2"</u> are stacked and centered vertically.

       A  string  attached  to  an  object overlays the object at the center, and any <b>height</b> or <b>width</b> attributes
       apply to the object, not the string.  However, the  justification  attributes  <b>ljust</b>  and  <b>rjust</b>  can  be
       applied to the individual strings of a stack overlaying an object.

       An  independent  string  is  placed with its center at the current point by default, or by specifying the
       position of one of its defined points as for any <u>object,</u> for example,

           <b>"Animal</b> <b>crackers"</b> <b>wid</b> <b>82.3/72</b> <b>ht</b> <b>9.7/72</b> <b>with</b> <b>.sw</b> <b>at</b> <b>Q</b>

       The placement qualifiers <b>above,</b> <b>below,</b> <b>ljust,</b> <b>rjust</b> place the string  above,  below,  or  justified  with
       respect to the placement point.  For example,

          <b>"Animal</b> <b>crackers"</b> <b>at</b> <b>Q</b> <b>ljust</b> <b>above</b>

       places the string above and <b>textoffset</b> units to the right of <b>Q.</b>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Source file example.pic:

         <b>\documentclass{article}</b>
         <b>\usepackage{tikz}</b>
         <b>\begin{document}</b>
         <b>.PS</b>
         <b>box</b> <b>dashed</b> <b>"Hello"</b> <b>"World"</b>
         <b>.PE</b>
         <b>\end{document}</b>

       The command

          <b>dpic</b> <b>-g</b> <b>example.pic</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>example.tex;</b> <b>pdflatex</b> <b>example</b>

       produces example.pdf containing a dashed box with Hello and World stacked inside.

       To produce a .tex file containing PSTricks drawing commands for insertion into a LaTeX document using the
       \input command, delete the first three and last lines in the above source and process using the <b>-p</b> option
       of dpic.

       Similarly, the picture source

         <b>.PS</b>
         <b>\definecolor{puce}{rgb}{0.8,0.53,0.6}%</b>
         <b>box</b> <b>shaded</b> <b>"puce"</b>
         <b>.PE</b>

       produces  a  box  filled  with a flea‐like color when processed with <b>dpic</b> <b>-g</b> or <b>dpic</b> <b>-p</b> and the resulting
       file is inserted into a latex source file invoking, respectively, the tikz or pstricks package.
