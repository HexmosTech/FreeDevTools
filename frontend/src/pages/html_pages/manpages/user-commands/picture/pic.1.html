</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       The  GNU  implementation  of  <u>pic</u>  is part of the <u><a href="../man1/groff.1.html">groff</a></u>(1) document formatting system.  <u>pic</u> is a <u><a href="../man1/troff.1.html">troff</a></u>(1)
       preprocessor that translates descriptions of diagrammatic pictures embedded in <u><a href="../man7/roff.7.html">roff</a></u>(7) or TeX input files
       into the language understood by TeX or <u>troff</u>.  It copies the contents of each <u>file</u> to the standard output
       stream, except that lines between <b>.PS</b> and any of <b>.PE</b>, <b>.PF</b>, or <b>.PY</b> are interpreted as picture descriptions
       in the <u>pic</u> language.  End a <u>pic</u> picture with <b>.PE</b> to leave the drawing  position  at  the  bottom  of  the
       picture, and with <b>.PF</b> or <b>.PY</b> to leave it at the top.  Normally, <u>pic</u> is not executed directly by the user,
       but  invoked by specifying the <b>-p</b> option to <u><a href="../man1/groff.1.html">groff</a></u>(1).  If no <u>file</u> operands are given on the command line,
       or if <u>file</u> is “<b>-</b>”, the standard input stream is read.

       It is the user's responsibility to provide appropriate definitions of the <b>PS</b>, <b>PE</b>, and one or both of  the
       <b>PF</b>  and  <b>PY</b> macros.  When a macro package does not supply these, obtain simple definitions with the <u>groff</u>
       option <b>-mpic</b>; these will center each picture.

       GNU <u>pic</u> supports <b>PY</b> as a synonym of <b>PF</b> to work around a name space collision with the <u>mm</u>  macro  package,
       which defines <b>PF</b> as a page footer management macro.  Use <b>PF</b> preferentially unless a similar problem faces
       your document.

</pre><h4><b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--help</b> displays a usage message, while <b>-v</b> and <b>--version</b> show version information; all exit afterward.

       <b>-c</b>     Be  more  compatible  with  <u>tpic</u>;  implies  <b>-t</b>.   Lines  beginning  with  <b>\</b> are not passed through
              transparently.  Lines beginning with <b>.</b> are passed through with the initial <b>.</b> changed to <b>\</b>.  A line
              beginning with <b>.ps</b> is given special treatment: it takes an optional  integer  argument  specifying
              the  line  thickness  (pen  size)  in  milliinches;  a missing argument restores the previous line
              thickness; the default line thickness is 8 milliinches.  The line thickness thus  specified  takes
              effect  only  when  a  non-negative  line thickness has not been specified by use of the <b>thickness</b>
              attribute or by setting the <b>linethick</b> variable.

       <b>-C</b>     Recognize <b>.PS</b>, <b>.PE</b>, <b>.PF</b>, and <b>.PY</b> even when followed by a character other than space or newline.

       <b>-n</b>     Don't use <u>groff</u> extensions to the <u>troff</u> drawing commands.  Specify this option if a  postprocessor
              you're using doesn't support these extensions, described in <u><a href="../man5/groff_out.5.html">groff_out</a></u>(5).  This option also causes
              <u>pic</u> not to use zero-length lines to draw dots in <u>troff</u> mode.

       <b>-S</b>     Operate in <u>safer</u> <u>mode;</u> <b>sh</b> commands are ignored.  This mode, enabled by default, can be useful when
              operating on untrustworthy input.

       <b>-t</b>     Produce TeX output.

       <b>-U</b>     Operate in <u>unsafe</u> <u>mode;</u> <b>sh</b> commands are interpreted.

       <b>-z</b>     In TeX mode, draw dots using zero-length lines.

       The following options supported by other versions of <u>pic</u> are ignored.

       <b>-D</b>     Draw all lines using the \D escape sequence.  GNU <u>pic</u> always does this.

       <b>-T</b> <u>dev</u> Generate  output for the <u>troff</u> device <u>dev</u>.  This is unnecessary because the <u>troff</u> output generated
              by GNU <u>pic</u> is device-independent.

</pre><h4><b>Usage</b></h4><pre>
       This section primarily discusses the differences between GNU <u>pic</u> and the  Eighth  Edition  Research  Unix
       version of AT&amp;T <u>pic</u> (1985).  Many of these differences also apply to later versions of AT&amp;T <u>pic</u>.

   <b>TeX</b> <b>mode</b>
       TeX-compatible  output  is  produced  when  the  <b>-t</b>  option is specified.  You must use a TeX driver that
       supports <u>tpic</u> version 2 specials.  (<u>tpic</u> was a fork of AT&amp;T <u>pic</u>  by  Tim  Morgan  of  the  University  of
       California  at  Irvine that diverged from its source around 1984.  It is best known today for lending its
       name to a group of <b>\special</b> commands it produced for TeX.)

       Lines beginning with <b>\</b> are passed through transparently; a <b>%</b> is added to the end of  the  line  to  avoid
       unwanted  spaces.   You  can  safely  use  this  feature  to  change fonts or the value of <b>\baselineskip</b>.
       Anything else may well produce undesirable results; use at your own risk.  By  default,  lines  beginning
       with a dot are not treated specially—but see the <b>-c</b> option.

       In  TeX  mode,  <u>pic</u>  will define a vbox called <b>\graph</b> for each picture.  Use GNU <u>pic</u>'s <b>figname</b> command to
       change the name of the vbox.  You must print that vbox yourself using the command
              \centerline{\box\graph}
       for instance.  Since the vbox has a height of zero (it is defined with <b>\vtop</b>) this will produce  slightly
       more vertical space above the picture than below it;
              \centerline{\raise 1em\box\graph}
       would  avoid  this.   To  give  the  vbox  a  positive  height  and  a  depth of zero (as used by LaTeX's
       <u>graphics.sty</u>, for example) define the following macro in your document.
              \def\gpicbox#1{%
                \vbox{\unvbox\csname #1\endcsname\kern 0pt}}
       You can then simply say <b>\gpicbox{graph}</b> instead of <b>\box\graph</b>.

   <b>Commands</b>
       Several commands new to GNU <u>pic</u> accept delimiters, shown in their synopses as braces  <b>{</b>  <b>}</b>.   Nesting  of
       braces  is  supported.  Any other characters (except a space, tab, or newline) may be used as alternative
       delimiters, in which case the members of a given pair must be identical.  Strings are  recognized  within
       delimiters of either kind; they may contain the delimiter character or unbalanced braces.

       <b>for</b> <u>variable</u> <b>=</b> <u>expr1</u> <b>to</b> <u>expr2</u> [<b>by</b> [<b>*</b>]<u>expr3</u>] <b>do</b> <u>X</u> <u>body</u> <u>X</u>
              Set  <u>variable</u>  to  <u>expr1</u>.  While the value of <u>variable</u> is less than or equal to <u>expr2</u>, do <u>body</u> and
              increment <u>variable</u> by <u>expr3</u>; if <b>by</b> is not given, increment <u>variable</u> by 1.  If <u>expr3</u> is prefixed by
              <b>*</b> then <u>variable</u> will instead be multiplied by <u>expr3</u>.  The value of <u>expr3</u> can be negative  for  the
              additive  case;  <u>variable</u>  is  then  tested whether it is greater than or equal to <u>expr2</u>.  For the
              multiplicative case, <u>expr3</u> must be greater than zero.  If the constraints  aren't  met,  the  loop
              isn't executed.  <u>X</u> can be any character not occurring in <u>body</u>.

       <b>if</b> <u>expr</u> <b>then</b> <u>X</u> <u>if-true</u> <u>X</u> [<b>else</b> <u>Y</u> <u>if-false</u> <u>Y</u>]
              Evaluate  <u>expr</u>;  if it is non-zero then do <u>if-true</u>, otherwise do <u>if-false</u>.  <u>X</u> can be any character
              not occurring in <u>if-true</u>.  <u>Y</u> can be any character not occurring in <u>if-false</u>.

       <b>print</b> <u>arg</u> ...
              Concatenate and write arguments to the standard error stream followed by a newline.  Each <u>arg</u> must
              be an expression, a position, or text.  This is useful for debugging.

       <b>command</b> <u>arg</u> ...
              Concatenate arguments and pass them as a line to <u>troff</u> or TeX.  Each <u>arg</u> must be an expression,  a
              position, or text.  <b>command</b> allows the values of <u>pic</u> variables to be passed to the formatter.  For
              example,
                     .PS
                     x = 14
                     command ".ds string x is " x "."
                     .PE
                     \*[string]
              produces
                     x is 14.
              when formatted with <u>troff</u>.

       <b>sh</b> <u>X</u> <u>command</u> <u>X</u>
              Pass <u>command</u> to a shell.

       <b>copy</b> <b>"</b><u>filename</u><b>"</b>
              Include <u>filename</u> at this point in the file.

       <b>copy</b> [<b>"</b><u>filename</u><b>"</b>] <b>thru</b> <u>X</u> <u>body</u> <u>X</u> [<b>until</b> "<u>word</u><b>"</b>]
       <b>copy</b> [<b>"</b><u>filename</u><b>"</b>] <b>thru</b> <u>macro</u> [<b>until</b> "<u>word</u><b>"</b>]
              This  construct  does  <u>body</u> once for each line of <u>filename</u>; the line is split into blank-delimited
              words, and occurrences of <b>$</b><u>i</u> in <u>body</u>, for <u>i</u> between 1 and 9, are replaced by the <u>i</u>-th word of  the
              line.   If  <u>filename</u>  is not given, lines are taken from the current input up to <b>.PE</b>.  If an <b>until</b>
              clause is specified, lines will be read only until a line the first word of which  is  <u>word</u>;  that
              line will then be discarded.  <u>X</u> can be any character not occurring in <u>body</u>.  For example,
                     .PS
                     copy thru % circle at ($1,$2) % until "END"
                     1 2
                     3 4
                     5 6
                     END
                     box
                     .PE
              and
                     .PS
                     circle at (1,2)
                     circle at (3,4)
                     circle at (5,6)
                     box
                     .PE
              are equivalent.  The commands to be performed for each line can also be taken from a macro defined
              earlier  by  giving  the  name  of  the macro as the argument to <b>thru</b>.  The argument after <b>thru</b> is
              looked up as a macro name first;  if  not  defined,  its  first  character  is  interpreted  as  a
              delimiter.

       <b>reset</b>
       <b>reset</b> <u>pvar1</u>[<b>,</b>] <u>pvar2</u> ...
              Reset  predefined  variables  <u>pvar1</u>, <u>pvar2</u> ... to their default values; if no arguments are given,
              reset all predefined variables to their default  values.   Variable  names  may  be  separated  by
              commas,  spaces,  or  both.   Assigning a value to <b>scale</b> also causes all predefined variables that
              control dimensions to be reset to their default values times the new value of <b>scale</b>.

       <b>plot</b> <u>expr</u> [<b>"</b><u>text</u><b>"</b>]
              This is a text object which is constructed by using <u>text</u> as a format string for  sprintf  with  an
              argument  of  <u>expr</u>.   If  <u>text</u>  is  omitted  a  format  string of <b>"%g"</b> is used.  Attributes can be
              specified in the same way as for a normal text object.   Be  very  careful  that  you  specify  an
              appropriate  format string; <u>pic</u> does only very limited checking of the string.  This is deprecated
              in favour of <b>sprintf</b>.

       <u>var</u> <b>:=</b> <u>expr</u>
              This syntax resembles variable assignment with <b>=</b> except that <u>var</u> must already be defined, and <u>expr</u>
              will be assigned to <u>var</u> without creating a variable local to the current block.  (By  contrast,  <b>=</b>
              defines <u>var</u> in the current block if it is not already defined there, and then changes the value in
              the current block only.)  For example,
                     <b>.PS</b>
                     <b>x</b> <b>=</b> <b>3</b>
                     <b>y</b> <b>=</b> <b>3</b>
                     <b>[</b>
                     <b>x</b> <b>:=</b> <b>5</b>
                     <b>y</b> <b>=</b> <b>5</b>
                     <b>]</b>
                     <b>print</b> <b>x</b>   <b>y</b>
                     <b>.PE</b>
              writes
                     5 3
              to the standard error stream.

   <b>Expressions</b>
       The syntax for expressions has been significantly extended.

       <u>x</u> <b>^</b> <u>y</u> (exponentiation)
       <b>sin(</b><u>x</u><b>)</b>
       <b>cos(</b><u>x</u><b>)</b>
       <b>atan2(</b><u>y</u><b>,</b> <u>x</u><b>)</b>
       <b>log(</b><u>x</u><b>)</b> (base 10)
       <b>exp(</b><u>x</u><b>)</b> (base 10, i.e. 10^<u>x</u>)
       <b>sqrt(</b><u>x</u><b>)</b>
       <b>int(</b><u>x</u><b>)</b>
       <b>rand()</b> (return a random number between 0 and 1)
       <b>rand(</b><u>x</u><b>)</b> (return a random number between 1 and <u>x</u>; deprecated)
       <b>srand(</b><u>x</u><b>)</b> (set the random number seed)
       <b>max(</b><u>e1</u><b>,</b> <u>e2</u><b>)</b>
       <b>min(</b><u>e1</u><b>,</b> <u>e2</u><b>)</b>
       <b>!</b><u>e</u>
       <u>e1</u> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <u>e2</u>
       <u>e1</u> <b>||</b> <u>e2</u>
       <u>e1</u> <b>==</b> <u>e2</u>
       <u>e1</u> <b>!=</b> <u>e2</u>
       <u>e1</u> <b>&gt;=</b> <u>e2</u>
       <u>e1</u> <b>&gt;</b> <u>e2</u>
       <u>e1</u> <b>&lt;=</b> <u>e2</u>
       <u>e1</u> <b>&lt;</b> <u>e2</u>
       <b>"</b><u>str1</u><b>"</b> <b>==</b> <b>"</b><u>str2</u><b>"</b>
       <b>"</b><u>str1</u><b>"</b> <b>!=</b> <b>"</b><u>str2</u><b>"</b>

       String comparison expressions must be parenthesised in some contexts to avoid ambiguity.

   <b>Other</b> <b>changes</b>
       A  bare  expression,  <u>expr</u>, is acceptable as an attribute; it is equivalent to <u>dir</u> <u>expr</u>, where <u>dir</u> is the
       current direction.  For example

              <b>line</b> <b>2i</b>

       means draw a line 2 inches long in the current direction.  The ‘i’ (or ‘I’) character is ignored; to  use
       another measurement unit, set the <u>scale</u> variable to an appropriate value.

       The  maximum  width  and  height  of  the  picture  are  taken  from  the variables <b>maxpswid</b> and <b>maxpsht</b>.
       Initially, these have values 8.5 and 11.

       Scientific notation is allowed for numbers.  For example

              <b>x</b> <b>=</b> <b>5e-2</b>

       Text attributes can be compounded.  For example,

              <b>"foo"</b> <b>above</b> <b>ljust</b>

       is valid.

       There is no limit to the depth to which blocks can be examined.  For example,

              [A: [B: [C: box ]]] with .A.B.C.sw at 1,2
              circle at last [].A.B.C

       is acceptable.

       Arcs now have compass points determined by the circle of which the arc is a part.

       Circles, ellipses, and arcs can be dotted or dashed.  In TeX mode splines can be dotted or dashed also.

       Boxes can have rounded corners.  The <b>rad</b> attribute specifies the radius of the  quarter-circles  at  each
       corner.  If no <b>rad</b> or <b>diam</b> attribute is given, a radius of <b>boxrad</b> is used.  Initially, <b>boxrad</b> has a value
       of 0.  A box with rounded corners can be dotted or dashed.

       Boxes  can  have  slanted  sides.   This  effectively  changes  the shape of a box from a rectangle to an
       arbitrary parallelogram.  The <b>xslanted</b> and <b>yslanted</b> attributes specify the x and y offset  of  the  box's
       upper right corner from its default position.

       The  <b>.PS</b>  line  can  have a second argument specifying a maximum height for the picture.  If the width of
       zero is specified the width will be ignored in computing the scaling factor for  the  picture.   GNU  <u>pic</u>
       will  always  scale  a  picture by the same amount vertically as well as horizontally.  This is different
       from DWB 2.0 <u>pic</u> which may scale a picture by a different amount vertically than horizontally if a height
       is specified.

       Each text object has an invisible box associated with it.  The  compass  points  of  a  text  object  are
       determined  by  this box.  The implicit motion associated with the object is also determined by this box.
       The dimensions of this box are taken from the width and height attributes; if the width attribute is  not
       supplied  then  the  width  will be taken to be <b>textwid</b>; if the height attribute is not supplied then the
       height will be taken to be  the  number  of  text  strings  associated  with  the  object  times  <b>textht</b>.
       Initially, <b>textwid</b> and <b>textht</b> have a value of 0.

       In (almost all) places where a quoted text string can be used, an expression of the form

              <b>sprintf("</b><u>format</u><b>",</b> <u>arg</u><b>,</b> ...<b>)</b>

       can also be used; this will produce the arguments formatted according to <u>format</u>, which should be a string
       as described in <u><a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a></u>(3) appropriate for the number of arguments supplied.  Only the modifiers “<b>#</b>”, “<b>-</b>”,
       “<b>+</b>”,  and  “  ” [space]), a minimum field width, an optional precision, and the conversion specifiers <b>%e</b>,
       <b>%E</b>, <b>%f</b>, <b>%g</b>, <b>%G</b>, and <b>%%</b> are supported.

       The thickness of the lines used to draw objects is controlled by the <b>linethick</b> variable.  This gives  the
       thickness of lines in points.  A negative value means use the default thickness: in TeX output mode, this
       means  use  a  thickness of 8 milliinches; in TeX output mode with the <b>-c</b> option, this means use the line
       thickness specified by <b>.ps</b> lines; in <u>troff</u> output mode, this means use a thickness  proportional  to  the
       pointsize.   A  zero  value  means  draw  the  thinnest  possible  line  supported  by the output device.
       Initially, it has a value of -1.  There is also a <b>thick</b>[<b>ness</b>] attribute.  For example,

              <b>circle</b> <b>thickness</b> <b>1.5</b>

       would draw a circle using a line with a thickness of 1.5 points.  The thickness of lines is not  affected
       by the value of the <b>scale</b> variable, nor by the width or height given in the <b>.PS</b> line.

       Boxes  (including  boxes  with  rounded  corners or slanted sides), circles and ellipses can be filled by
       giving them an attribute of <b>fill</b>[<b>ed</b>].  This takes an optional argument of  an  expression  with  a  value
       between  0  and  1; 0 will fill it with white, 1 with black, values in between with a proportionally gray
       shade.  A value greater than 1 can also be used: this means fill with the shade of gray that is currently
       being used for text and lines.  Normally this will be black, but output devices may provide  a  mechanism
       for changing this.  Without an argument, then the value of the variable <b>fillval</b> will be used.  Initially,
       this  has  a  value  of  0.5.   The invisible attribute does not affect the filling of objects.  Any text
       associated with a filled object will be added after the object has been filled, so that the text will not
       be obscured by the filling.

       Additional modifiers are available to draw colored objects: <b>outline</b>[<b>d</b>] sets the  color  of  the  outline,
       <b>shaded</b>  the  fill  color, and <b>colo</b>[<b>u</b>]<b>r</b>[<b>ed</b>] sets both.  All expect a subsequent string argument specifying
       the color.
              circle shaded "green" outline "black"
       Color is not yet supported in TeX mode.  Device macro files like <u>ps.tmac</u> declare  color  names;  you  can
       define additional ones with the <b>defcolor</b> request (see <u><a href="../man7/groff.7.html">groff</a></u>(7)).

       To  change  the  name  of  the  vbox  in  TeX  mode, set the pseudo-variable <b>figname</b> (which is actually a
       specially parsed command) within a picture.  Example:

              <b>.PS</b>
              <b>figname</b> <b>=</b> <b>foobar;</b>
              <b>...</b>
              <b>.PE</b>

       The picture is then available in the box <b>\foobar</b>.

       <u>pic</u> assumes that at the beginning of a picture both glyph and fill color are set to the default value.

       Arrow heads will be drawn as solid triangles if the variable <b>arrowhead</b> is non-zero and either TeX mode is
       enabled or the <b>-n</b> option has not been given.  Initially, <b>arrowhead</b> has a value of 1.  Solid  arrow  heads
       are always filled with the current outline color.

       The  <u>troff</u>  output  of <u>pic</u> is device-independent.  The <b>-T</b> option is therefore redundant.  All numbers are
       taken to be in inches; numbers are never interpreted to be in <u>troff</u> machine units.

       Objects can have an <b>aligned</b> attribute.   This  will  only  work  if  the  postprocessor  is  <u><a href="../man1/grops.1.html">grops</a></u>(1)  or
       <u><a href="../man1/gropdf.1.html">gropdf</a></u>(1).   Any  text  associated  with an object having the <b>aligned</b> attribute will be rotated about the
       center of the object so that it is aligned in the direction from the start point to the end point of  the
       object.  This attribute will have no effect on objects whose start and end points are coincident.

       In  places  where <u>n</u><b>th</b> is allowed, <b>'</b><u>expr</u><b>'th</b> is also allowed.  “<b>'th</b>“ is a single token: no space is allowed
       between the apostrophe and the “<b>th</b>”.  For example,

              for i = 1 to 4 do {
                 line from 'i'th box.nw to 'i+1'th box.se
              }

</pre><h4><b>Conversion</b></h4><pre>
       To obtain a stand-alone picture from a <u>pic</u> file, enclose your <u>pic</u> code with <b>.PS</b> and  <b>.PE</b>  requests;  <u>roff</u>
       configuration commands may be added at the beginning of the file, but no <u>roff</u> text.

       It is necessary to feed this file into <u>groff</u> without adding any page information, so you must check which
       <b>.PS</b> and <b>.PE</b> requests are actually called.  For example, the <u>mm</u> macro package adds a page number, which is
       very  annoying.   At  the moment, calling standard <u>groff</u> without any macro package works.  Alternatively,
       you can define your own requests, e.g., to do nothing:

              .de PS
              ..
              .de PE
              ..

       <u>groff</u> itself does not provide direct conversion into other graphics file formats.  But there are lots  of
       possibilities  if  you  first transform your picture into PostScript® format using the <u>groff</u> option <b>-Tps</b>.
       Since this <u>ps</u>-file lacks BoundingBox information it is not very useful by itself, but it may be fed  into
       other  conversion  programs,  usually  named <b>ps2</b><u>other</u> or <b>psto</b><u>other</u> or the like.  Moreover, the PostScript
       interpreter Ghostscript (<u><a href="../man1/gs.1.html">gs</a></u>(1)) has built-in graphics conversion devices that are called with the option

              <b>gs</b> <b>-sDEVICE=</b><u>&lt;devname&gt;</u>

       Call

              <b>gs</b> <b>--help</b>

       for a list of the available devices.

       An alternative may be to use the <b>-Tpdf</b> option to convert your picture  directly  into  <b>PDF</b>  format.   The
       MediaBox of the file produced can be controlled by passing a <b>-P-p</b> papersize to <u>groff</u>.

       As  the  Encapsulated  PostScript  File Format <b>EPS</b> is getting more and more important, and the conversion
       wasn't regarded trivial in the past you might be interested to know that there is a conversion tool named
       <u>ps2eps</u> which does the right job.  It is much better than the tool <u>ps2epsi</u> packaged with <u>gs</u>.

       For bitmapped graphic formats, you should use <u>pstopnm</u>; the resulting (intermediate) <u><a href="../man5/pnm.5.html">pnm</a></u>(5)  file  can  be
       then converted to virtually any graphics format using the tools of the <b>netpbm</b> package.

</pre><h4><b>Files</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/pic.tmac">/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/pic.tmac</a></u>
              offers simple definitions of the <b>PS</b>, <b>PE</b>, <b>PF</b>, and <b>PY</b> macros.

</pre><h4><b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       Characters  that  are  invalid as input to GNU <u>troff</u> (see the <u>groff</u> Texinfo manual or <u><a href="../man7/groff_char.7.html">groff_char</a></u>(7) for a
       list) are rejected even in TeX mode.

       The interpretation of <b>fillval</b> is incompatible  with  the  <u>pic</u>  in  Tenth  Edition  Research  Unix,  which
       interprets 0 as black and 1 as white.
