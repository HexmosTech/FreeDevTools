</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       flickr_upload - Upload photos to "flickr.com"

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       flickr_upload [--auth] --auth_token &lt;auth_token&gt; [--title &lt;title&gt;]      [--description description]
       [--public &lt;0|1&gt;] [--friend &lt;0|1&gt;]      [--family &lt;0|1&gt;] [--tag &lt;tag&gt;] [--option key=value] [--progress]
           &lt;photos...&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Batch image uploader for the Flickr.com service.

       flickr_upload may also be useful for generating authentication tokens against other API keys/secrets
       (i.e. for embedding in scripts).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --auth
           The  "--auth"  flag will cause flickr_upload to generate an authentication token against it's API key
           and secret (or, if you want, your own specific key and secret).  This process requires the caller  to
           have  a  browser  handy so they can cut and paste a url. The resulting token should be kept somewhere
           like "<a href="file:~/.flickrrc">~/.flickrrc</a>" since it's necessary for actually uploading images.

       --auth_token &lt;auth_token&gt;
           Authentication token. You <b>must</b> get an authentication token  using  "--auth"  before  you  can  upload
           images. See the EXAMPLES section.

       --oauth
           Interactively  perform OAuth authorization with Flickr. The user will get a URL to visit at Flickr at
           which Flickr::Upload must be granted write permissions. After granting permission, the user  will  be
           redirected to a dummy URL that contains an OAuth token and verifier. This user will paste this URL at
           the prompt, and flickr_upload will save the resulting credentials in "<a href="file:~/.flickroauth.st">~/.flickroauth.st</a>".

       --title &lt;title&gt;
           Title to use on all the images. Optional.

       --description &lt;description&gt;
           Description to use on all the images. Optional.

       --public &lt;0|1&gt;
           Override the default "is_public" access control. Optional.

       --friend &lt;0|1&gt;
           Override the default "is_friend" access control. Optional.

       --family &lt;0|1&gt;
           Override the default "is_family" access control. Optional.

       --tag &lt;tag&gt;
           Images  are  tagged  with  "tag". Multiple "--tag" options can be given, or you can just put them all
           into a single space-separated list. If you want to define a tag with spaces, the quotes  have  to  be
           part of the tag itself.  The following works in bash:

             flickr_upload --tag='"tag one"' --tag='"tag two"' image.jpg

       --reverse
           Reverse  the  list  of  supplied  images.  Useful  when  uploading  contents of directory with sorted
           filenames. Following example will upload the last glob expanded file as first  and  vice  versa.  The
           last file will appear first in target photo stream.

             flickr_upload --reverse *.jpg

       --set &lt;NAME&gt;
           After  successfully  uploading all photos, create a new set named "NAME", and add the photos into the
           set. One (random) photo will be the set's thumbnail.

       --option key=value
           Flickr periodically adds new features to the uploading API, and these are almost  always  implemented
           as  new key/value pairs. Rather than waiting for a new Flickr::Upload release, you can specify any of
           the upload API's optional arguments using "--option".

             flick_upload --option content_type=1 --tag='cats' two_cats.jpg

           You may also use "--option" rather than flickr_upload's command-line options:

             flickr_upload --option is_public=1 --option title='cats' two_cats.jpg

           While      Flickr      may       add       new       options       at       any       time       (see
           &lt;https://www.flickr.com/services/api/upload.api.html&gt;  for the most up-to-date list), currently known
           options include:

           --option safety_level=&lt;1|2|3&gt;
               Override the default "safety_level" notation.  Set to 1 for  Safe,  2  for  Moderate,  or  3  for
               Restricted.  Refer to &lt;https://www.flickr.com/help/filters/&gt;.

           --option content_type=&lt;1|2|3&gt;
               Override  the  default  "content_type"  notation.  Set to 1 for Photo, 2 for Screenshot, or 3 for
               Art/Illustration.  Refer to &lt;https://www.flickr.com/help/filters/&gt;.

           --option hidden=&lt;1|2&gt;
               Override the default "hidden" notation.  Set to 1 to keep the photo in global search  results,  2
               to hide from public earches.

           Note that options unknown to Flickr will result in undefined behaviour.

       --check
           Checks  the authentication token via the flickr.auth.checkToken API call.  This can be used to verify
           API keys and credentials without trying to upload an image. The output is the raw results of the  API
           call.

       --progress, --no-progress
           Display  a  progress bar for each upload with Term::ProgressBar. That optional module will have to be
           installed on the system.

           The default is not to display a progress bar. That can be changed in the configuration file:

               echo progress=1 &gt;<a href="file:~/.flickrrc">~/.flickrrc</a>

       --report, --no-report
           Report the status of each upload ticket after uploading the batch via  Flickr::Upload's  check_upload
           method. On by default. Checking the status can be canceled by pressing ctrl-C.

           The default is to display a report after each upload. That can be changed in the configuration file:

               echo report=0 &gt;<a href="file:~/.flickrrc">~/.flickrrc</a>

       --key &lt;api_key&gt;
       --secret &lt;secret&gt;
           Your  own API key and secret. This is useful if you want to use flickr_upload in auth mode as a token
           generator. You need both "key" and "secret". Both "key" and "secret" can be placed in  "<a href="file:~/.flickrrc">~/.flickrrc</a>",
           allowing  to mix flickr_upload with your own scripts using the same API key and authentication token.
           Getting your own API key and secret is encouraged if you're tying  flickr_upload  to  some  automated
           process.

           Note  that  if you do get an authentication token against your own API key and secret, you'll need to
           specify the key and secret along with the token when uploading images. The default flickr_upload  API
           key and token won't work in that case.

       &lt;photos...&gt;
           List  of  photos  to  upload. Uploading stops as soon as a failure is detected during the upload. The
           script exit code will indicate the number of images on the command line that were not  uploaded.  For
           each  uploaded  image,  a  Flickr URL will be generated. flickr_upload uses asynchronous uploading so
           while the image is usually transferred fairly quickly, it might take a  while  before  it's  actually
           available  to users. flickr_upload will wait around for that to complete, but be aware that delays of
           upwards of thirty minutes have (rarely) been know to occur.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       First, you need to get an authentication token. This is a requirement driven by how Flickr manages third-
       party applications:

          cpb@earth:~$ flickr_upload --auth
               1. Enter the following URL into your browser

               https://www.flickr.com/services/auth?api_sig=&lt;...&gt;&amp;frob=&lt;...&gt;&amp;perms=write&amp;api_key=&lt;...&gt;

               2. Follow the instructions on the web page
               3. Hit &lt;Enter&gt; when finished.
               Your authentication token for this application is
               &lt;token&gt;

       Unless you like typing long numbers on the command-line, you should keep the "&lt;token"&gt;  somewhere  handy,
       like a configuration file:

          echo auth_token=&lt;token&gt; &gt;<a href="file:~/.flickrrc">~/.flickrrc</a>

       Uploading a bunch of images is then as easy as:

          flickr_upload --tag 'dog' 'kernel in a window.jpg' 'sad in sunbeam.jpg'

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       To  avoid  having  to  remember authentication tokens and such (or have them show up in the process table
       listings), default values will be read from "$HOME/.flickrrc" if it exists. Any field defined there  can,
       of course, be overridden on the command line. For example:

               # my config at $HOME/.flickrrc
               auth_token=334455
               is_public=0
               is_friend=1
               is_family=1

       Note,  however, that these defaults override the defaults you've assigned in your Flickr profile. You may
       want to do all that stuff in one place.

       Error handling could be better.
