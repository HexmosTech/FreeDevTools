</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Rapid</b> <b>Photo</b> <b>Downloader</b> imports photos and videos from cameras, phones, memory cards and other devices at
       high speed. It can be configured to rename photos and videos with meaningful filenames you specify. It
       can also back up photos and videos as they are downloaded. It downloads from and backs up to multiple
       devices simultaneously.

       Unique to Rapid Photo Downloader is its Timeline, which groups photos and videos based on how much time
       elapsed between consecutive shots. Use it to identify photos and videos taken at different periods in a
       single day or over consecutive days.

       Files are downloaded from two different types of sources: (1) one or more automatically detected devices
       like cameras, phones, memory cards, and external drives; and (2) a single manually specified path, shown
       in the user interface as "This Computer".

</pre><h4><b>PATH</b></h4><pre>
       Optional value that when specified, is parsed to determine if it represents an automatically detected
       device or a path on this computer.

       If the path represents an automatically detected device, automatic detection of devices is turned on, as
       in the <b>--auto-detect</b> option. Furthermore, downloading from a manually specified path as in the
       <b>--this-computer-location</b> option is turned off.

       Otherwise, the path is assumed to be a manually specified path as in the <b>--this-computer-location</b> option,
       in which case downloading from this computer is turned on and downloading from automatically detected
       devices is turned off.
