       <b>bittwist</b> -- pcap based ethernet packet generator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bittwist</b> [ <b>-djvh</b> ] [ <b>-i</b> <u>interface</u> ] [ <b>-s</b> <u>len</u> ] [ <b>-l</b> <u>loop</u> ]
                [ <b>-c</b> <u>count</u> ] [ <b>-p</b> <u>pps</u> ] [ <b>-r</b> <u>rate</u> ] [ <b>-t</b> <u>gap</u> ]
                <u>pcap-file(s)</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  document  describes  the <u>bittwist</u> program, the <u><a href="../man3/pcap.3.html">pcap</a></u>(3) based Ethernet packet generator. <u>Bittwist</u> is
       designed to work under Ethernet II (IEEE 802.3) network with an  MTU  of  up  to  1500  bytes  on  10Mbps
       (10Base-T),  100Mbps  (100BASE-TX),  1Gbps  (1000BASE-T),  or  10Gbps (10GBASE-T) link speed. Packets are
       generated from saved <u><a href="../man1/tcpdump.1.html">tcpdump</a></u>(1) capture file referred to as trace file in this document. Some familiarity
       with <u><a href="../man1/tcpdump.1.html">tcpdump</a></u>(1) and its basic options are  assumed  in  this  document.  Since  <u>bittwist</u>  uses  functions
       provided  by  <u><a href="../man3/pcap.3.html">pcap</a></u>(3)  library,  e.g.  <b>pcap_open_live()</b>  and <b>pcap_sendpacket()</b>, to write packets onto the
       network, it may require that you have special privileges, e.g. read access to <u>/dev/bpf*</u> on  BSD  or  root
       access on Linux, to generate packets or to enumerate network devices with, for example, the <b>-d</b> flag.

       <u>Bittwist</u>  will, if not run with the <b>-s</b> flag, inject each packet up to its actual length (on-wire) instead
       of its captured length. If the captured length is less than the actual  length,  <u>bittwist</u>  will  pad  the
       packet  with zeros up to its actual length prior to injection. <u>Bittwist</u> will, if not run with the <b>-p</b>, <b>-r</b>,
       or <b>-t</b> flag, inject packets from a trace  file  based  on  the  captured  intervals,  in  particular,  the
       timestamp  difference between two adjacent packets, except for the first packet in a trace file, which is
       always injected immediately. <u>Bittwist</u> is designed to not to interfere with the  packet  data;  it  merely
       read  a  packet  and inject it as is onto the network. If modification is desired prior to injection of a
       packet, you can use the <u><a href="../man1/bittwiste.1.html">bittwiste</a></u>(1) program, which does just that.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b>     Print a list of network interfaces available.

       <b>-j</b>     Enable jumbo frame with an MTU of up to 9000 bytes. Specify this flag if you wish to send  packets
              with length greater than the typical MTU of 1500 bytes.

       <b>-v</b>     Print timestamp for each packet.

       <b>-vv</b>    Print timestamp and hex data for each packet.

       <b>-i</b> <u>interface</u>
              Send <u>pcap-file(s)</u> out onto the network through <u>interface</u>.

       <b>-s</b> <u>len</u> Packet length to send (in bytes). Set <u>len</u> to:

               <b>0</b> : Send the actual packet length. This is the default.
              <b>-1</b> : Send the captured length.

              or any other value from 14 to 9014. Value greater than 1514 requires -j flag to be specified.

       <b>-l</b> <u>loop</u>
              Send  <u>pcap-file(s)</u>  out  onto the network for <u>loop</u> times. Set <u>loop</u> to 0 to send <u>pcap-file(s)</u> until
              stopped. To stop, type Control-C.

       <b>-c</b> <u>count</u>
              Send up to <u>count</u> packets. Default is to send all packets from <u>pcap-file(s)</u>.

       <b>-p</b> <u>pps</u> Send <u>pps</u> packets per second. Value for  <u>pps</u>  must  be  between  1  to  1000000.  This  flag  takes
              precedence over the <b>-r</b> flag.

       <b>-r</b> <u>rate</u>
              Limit  the  sending to <u>rate</u> Mbps. Value for <u>rate</u> must be between 0 to 10000. This flag is intended
              to set the desired packet throughput. If you want to send packets at line rate of 1000  Mbps,  try
              <b>-r</b>  1000.  If  you  want to send packets without rate limit, try <b>-r</b> 0. This flag is typically used
              with <b>-l</b> 0 to send <u>pcap-file(s)</u> until stopped.  This flag takes precedence over the <b>-t</b> flag.

       <b>-t</b> <u>gap</u> Set inter-packet <u>gap</u> in seconds, ignoring the captured interval between packets  in  <u>pcap-file(s)</u>.
              Value for <u>gap</u> must be between 1 to 86400.

       <b>-h</b>     Print version information and usage.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       File your bug report and send to:

              Addy Yeow &lt;<a href="mailto:ayeowch@gmail.com">ayeowch@gmail.com</a>&gt;

       Make sure you are using the latest stable version before submitting your bug report.

       If you run <u>bittwist</u> with <b>-r</b> flag, <b>pcap_sendpacket</b>() may return an error with the following error string:

              send: No buffer space available

       We  recommend  that you adjust the value for <b>-r</b> flag to limit the packet throughput to a lower level that
       is supported by your interface, e.g. start from <b>-r</b> 10 to inject packets at a maximum rate of  10Mbps  and
       adjust the value accordingly.
