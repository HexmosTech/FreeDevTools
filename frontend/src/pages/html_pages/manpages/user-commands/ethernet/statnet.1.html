</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       statnet,statnetd - views the statistics of Ethernet and PLIP/PPP/SLIP for TCP, IP, IPX, Appletalk, etc

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>statnet</b> <b>[</b> <b>-agipstuh</b> <b>]</b> <b>[-k</b> <b>key]</b>

       <b>statnetd</b> <b>[</b> <b>-adgipstuh</b> <b>]</b> <b>[-k</b> <b>key]</b> <b>[-n</b> <b>name]</b> <b>[-w</b> <b>interface]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>statnetd</b> is the privileged daemon which collects network data.

       <b>statnet</b>  views  the  current  usage  statistics  of  your  Ethernet  and  PLIP/PPP/SLIP for TCP, IP, IPX,
       Appletalk, and more. It is terminated by typing "q".

       It shows:
              - kilobytes per second on ethernet, PPP, and other interfaces.
              - the percentage load of ethernet capacity.
              - frames per second.
              - how many frames of each type (like IP, 802.2, and some Appletalk or TCP frames) were seen.

       The purpose is to give some idea of the quantity and type of network activity (flashing lights on the hub
       are minimally informative).  Other tools such as tcpdump are needed for detailed analysis.

       Only certain frames/packets were shown in the first  versions.   Now  the  data  for  many  more  packets
       encountered  on  your  net are shown.  Only certain TCP/UDP ports are known (under port 1024 by default),
       and TCP/UDP traffic to unknown port numbers is not shown, although the presence of the frames  are  shown
       in protocol counts.

       Note  that  <b>statnetd</b>  uses IPC shared memory so there can be many clients such as <b>statnet</b> running.  Other
       clients, such as an SNMP agent, may also be using the data.  The <b>statnetd</b> IPC shared  memory  is  enabled
       for DIPC, so the data from one copy of <b>statnetd</b> is available to all machines on a DIPC cluster.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       For <b>statnetd</b>, most options select the type of data to be collected.  For <b>statnet</b>, most options select the
       type of data to be displayed.  Defaults collect and display most data.

       <b>-a</b>     Appletalk protocol

       <b>-d</b>     Daemonize  (  <b>statnetd</b>  only).   Run  as  a  background  process.   Probably  should be entered as
              "/usr/local/bin/statnetd -d" in /etc/rc.d/rc.local.

       <b>-g</b>     General statistics

       <b>-i</b>     IP Protocols

       <b>-k</b> <b>key</b> Use <u>key</u> as the shared memory key.  Base 16 recognized with '0x' prefix, base 8  with  '0'  prefix,
              otherwise <u>key</u> is in base 10.

       <b>-n</b> <b>name</b>
              Server or network name ( <b>statnetd</b> only).  The label other than <a href="../man2/uname.2.html">uname</a>(2) nodename to label the data
              with.  Often a computer or network name is used.

       <b>-p</b>     PLIP/PPP/SLIP statistics

       <b>-s</b>     IEEE 802.2 SAP protocol

       <b>-t</b>     TCP/IP protocol

       <b>-u</b>     UDP/IP protocol

       <b>-w</b> <b>interface</b>
              Specify an interface to monitor other than the default "eth0" ( <b>statnetd</b> only).  See <u><a href="file:/proc/net/dev">/proc/net/dev</a></u>
              for a list of interfaces.

       <b>-h</b>     print a short help message

</pre><h4><b>DISPLAY</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>statnet</b> display client appearance will vary depending upon options and display type.  It can operate
       under "curses" or "ncurses" libraries (compile time option).  Another popular trick on  X-Windows  is  to
       open an xterm window which is tall and as narrow as the "General" display, so the subwindows appear below
       each other.

       Totals  may  vary  slightly  due to the data being captured as it is being collected, as more packets may
       arrive while the totals are being prepared for display (fortunately packets arrive slowly compared to the
       speed of copying the totals).

       The percentage numbers are the percent of the total number of frames during the display period.

       If the network interface reports errors, a summary is reported near the bottom of the "General"  display.
       Error behavior depends upon your interface and device driver.  (Error reporting not working in 3.2)

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The  files  <u><a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a></u>,  <u>/etc/opt/statnet/services</u>,  and <u>services</u> in the current directory are read in
       that order for port number definitions.  Later definitions override  previous  ones.   A  few  names  are
       replaced with shorter or more recognizable names (ie, <u>nameserver</u> is replaced with <u>DNS</u>).

       File format:
             telnet           23/tcp    # Telnet
       The above line specifies that TCP port 23 is used for the <b>telnet</b> service.

       The file <u><a href="file:/etc/protocols">/etc/protocols</a></u> is also read with the <b><a href="../man3/getprotoent.3.html">getprotoent</a>(3)</b> routine for IP protocol definitions.

</pre><h4><b>PROBLEMS</b></h4><pre>
       By  default  the  eth0  ethernet device is monitored.  Monitoring SLIP or PPP devices may not work.  Data
       from devices other than the one specified may be shown, depending upon operating  system  characteristics
       of a promiscuous socket.

       Many  networking  numbers are compiled within the program and cannot be updated without altering a source
       file.  But this is still more informative than a flashing light on the hub.
