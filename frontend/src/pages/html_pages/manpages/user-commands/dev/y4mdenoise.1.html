</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>y4mdenoise</b> can be used to remove noise from images in a YUV4MPEG2 stream. This is useful for cleaning old
       sources to increase video quality, and to reduce the bitrate needed to encode your video  (e.g.  for  VCD
       and SVCD creation).

</pre><h4><b>HOW</b> <b>IT</b> <b>WORKS</b></h4><pre>
       It  maintains  a  list  of  the  last  several  frames, called reference frames.  Each reference frame is
       composed of reference pixels.  Every time a pixel in one frame is proven to be  a  moved  instance  of  a
       pixel in another frame, the reference-pixel incorporates its value, and produces an average value for all
       instances of the pixel.  The oldest reference frame, therefore, gets a pretty good idea of the real value
       of every pixel, but of course output is delayed by the number of reference frames.

       The  search  is  not  actually  done  one pixel at a time; it's done in terms of pixel groups.  An entire
       pixel-group has to match for any match to be found, but all possible pixel-groups are  tested  (i.e.  all
       possible overlapping combinations are checked).  Using pixel-groups helps to establish a minimum standard
       for  what  may be considered a match, in order to avoid finding lots of really small (and really useless)
       matches.  Presently, intensity pixel-groups are 4x2 (i.e. 4 across and 2 down),  and  color  pixel-groups
       are 2x2.

       It  compares every pixel-group in the current frame with all pixel-groups in the previous frame, within a
       given search-radius, and sorts them based on how close the match was, keeping  the  top  contenders.   It
       then  flood-fills  each  found  pixel-group  in turn, to determine the full size of the match.  The first
       match found to be big enough is applied to the image.  The number of  contenders  to  consider,  and  the
       minimum size of a match, can be specified on the command line.

       At  the end of the frame, any new-frame pixels not resolved yet are considered to be new information, and
       a new reference-pixel is generated for each one.

       A "zero-motion pass" happens each frame, before motion-detection, in an attempt to resolve  most  of  the
       frame cheaply.  Its error-tolerance can be set separately.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>y4mdenoise</b> accepts the following options:

       <b>-v</b> <u>[0..2]</u> <u>verbosity</u>
           0 = none, 1 = normal (per-frame pixel-detection totals), 2=debug.

       <b>-p</b> <u>num</u>
           Controls the level of parallelism.  Since intensity and color are denoised separately by design, it's
           very easy to do each in parallel on a multiple-processor machine.  The default value is 1; that reads
           and  writes  video  frames in parallel with denoising.  A value of 2 causes intensity and color to be
           denoised in parallel.  A value of 3 does both types of concurrency.  A  value  of  0  turns  off  all
           concurrency.

       <b>-r</b> <u>[4..]</u> <u>search</u> <u>radius</u>
           The  search  radius,  i.e.  the  maximum distance that a pixel can move and still be found by motion-
           detection.  The default is 16.  There are no particular restrictions on the search  radius,  e.g.  it
           doesn't have to be an even multiple of 4.

       <b>-R</b> <u>[4..]</u> <u>color</u> <u>search</u> <u>radius</u>
           The  search  radius  to  use for color.  Default is whatever the main search-radius was set to.  Note
           that this value ends up getting scaled by the relative size of  intensity  &amp;  color  planes  in  your
           YUV4MPEG2 stream.

       <b>-t</b> <u>[0..255]</u> <u>Error</u> <u>tolerance</u>
           The  largest difference between two pixels that's accepted for the two pixels to be considered equal.
           The default is 3, which is good for medium-noise material like analog cable  TV.   (This  value  will
           have to be changed to whatever is appropriate for your YUV4MPEG2 stream in order to avoid undesirable
           results.  See the instructions below.)

       <b>-T</b> <u>[0..255]</u> <u>Error</u> <u>tolerance</u> <u>for</u> <u>color</u>
           The default is whatever the main error-tolerance was set to.

       <b>-z</b> <u>[0..255]</u> <u>Error</u> <u>tolerance</u> <u>for</u> <u>zero-motion</u> <u>pass</u>
           The  error-tolerance used on pixels that haven't moved.  Usually equal to the main error-tolerance or
           one less than that.  Default is 2.

       <b>-Z</b> <u>[0..255]</u> <u>Error</u> <u>tolerance</u> <u>for</u> <u>color's</u> <u>zero-motion</u> <u>pass</u>
           The default is whatever the main zero-motion error-tolerance was set to.

       <b>-m</b> <u>[num]</u> <u>Match-count</u> <u>throttle</u>
           The maximum number of pixel-group matches (within the search radius) to consider.  If more are found,
           only the closest matches are kept.  Default is 15.

       <b>-M</b> <u>[num]</u> <u>Match-size</u> <u>throttle</u>
           The minimum size of the flood-filled region generated from a match.  Matches smaller  than  this  are
           thrown away.  Specified in terms of pixel-groups.  Default is 3.

       <b>-f</b> <u>num</u>
           The  number  of  reference  frames  to  keep.  Pixel values are averaged over this many frames before
           they're written to standard output; this also implies that output is delayed  by  this  many  frames.
           Default is 10.

       <b>-B</b>  Black-and-white mode.  Denoise only the intensity plane, and set the color plane to all white.

       <b>-I</b> <u>num</u>
           Set  interlacing  type.  Default is taken from the YUV4MPEG2 stream.  0 means not interlaced, 1 means
           top-field interlaced, 2 means bottom-field interlaced.  This  is  useful  when  the  signal  is  more
           naturally  of  some  other interlacing type than its current representation (e.g. if the original was
           shot on film and then later it was transferred to interlaced video, it will denoise better if treated
           as film, i.e.  non-interlaced).

</pre><h4><b>TYPICAL</b> <b>USAGE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>TIPS</b></h4><pre>
       Keep in mind that all of this advice was gained through experience.  (Just  because  one  writes  a  tool
       doesn't  mean  one  understands  how  it  should  be  used, for the same reason that car designers aren't
       necessarily professional drivers.)

       The error-threshold must be determined for every individual YUV4MPEG2 stream.  If the  threshold  is  set
       too  low, it'll leave noise in the video, and the denoiser will run a lot slower than it has to.  If it's
       set too high, the denoiser will start to remove  detail:  the  video  will  get  blurrier,  you  may  see
       topographical-like  bands  in  the  relatively flat areas of the video, and small parts of the video that
       should be moving will be stuck in place.  It may also run a little slower.   Additionally,  just  because
       the  video  came  to  you  from a clean source (digital cable TV, LaserDisc, etc.) doesn't mean the video
       itself is clean; <b>y4mdenoise</b> is capable of picking up on noise  in  the  original  recording  as  well  as
       sampling  error  from  the video-capture device.  You will have to generate small clips of representative
       parts of your video, denoise them with various error thresholds, and see what looks  the  best.   As  you
       gain  experience  with  the tool, you may know what error threshold generally works with various types of
       sources, but you'll still want to double-check your assumptions.

       Flat, shiny surfaces, like gloss-painted walls, or the polished wood floor of an indoor  gymnasium,  seem
       to require a lower error threshold than other types of video.

       Here is the author's experience:

        -t 1 : Digital cable TV, most LaserDiscs, DV camcorder video
        -t 2 : VHS camcorder video, commercially-produced videotapes
        -t 3 : Analog cable TV, VHS videotape (at the 2-hour speed)
        -t 4 : VHS videotape (at the 6-hour speed)

       Interlaced  video  that was made from non-interlaced video (e.g. a videotape or LaserDisc of a film) must
       be denoised as non-interlaced.  Otherwise the result tends to be grainy.

       <b>y4mdenoise</b> only removes temporal noise, i.e. noise that occurs over time.  And it tends to do such a good
       job of this, that the spatial noise (i.e. noise that occurs in nearby areas of the same frame)  tends  to
       become  very  distinct.  Therefore, always pipe the output of <b>y4mdenoise</b> through a spatial filter such as
       <b>y4mspatialfilter</b> or <b>yuvmedianfilter</b>.

       When producing very low bitrate video (e.g. VCD-compatible video less than  900  kbps),  denoise  at  the
       output frame size, e.g. don't denoise at DVD frame size then downscale to VCD size.  That will denoise as
       well as condition the video for the motion-detection part of <b>mpeg2enc</b>.  Not doing this will produce video
       where the less complex scenes will look really good, but high-motion scenes will blur significantly.

       JPEG  compression  of  your  video frames, even 100% compression, seems to be inaccurate enough to affect
       MPEG encoding.  Therefore, if you're using motion-JPEG files as your intermediary video format,  you  may
       want  to  use  the  denoiser  in your MPEG-encoding pipeline, i.e. after <b>lav2yuv</b> and before <b>mpeg2enc</b>.  If
       you're generating multiple resolutions of the same video, e.g. DVD and VCD, experience  shows  that  it's
       acceptable  to  run  <b>y4mdenoise</b>  before  <b>yuv2lav</b>,  but  you  should  still  use  the spatial-filter (e.g.
       <b>y4mspatialfilter</b>, <b>yuvmedianfilter</b>) in the MPEG-encoding pipeline, to try to  smooth  away  JPEG  encoding
       artifacts.
