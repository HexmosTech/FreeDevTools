</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       osmium-export - export OSM data

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>osmium</b> <b>export</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] <u>OSM-FILE</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The OSM data model with its nodes, ways, and relations is very different from the data model usually used
       for  geodata  with  features  having  point,  linestring,  or  polygon  geometries (or their cousins, the
       multipoint, multilinestring, or multipolygon geometries).

       The <b>export</b> command transforms OSM data into a more usual GIS data model.  Nodes will be  translated  into
       points  and  ways  into  linestrings  or  polygons  (if they are closed ways).  Multipolygon and boundary
       relations will be translated into  multipolygons.   This  transformation  is  not  loss-less,  especially
       information in non-multipolygon, non-boundary relations is lost.

       All  tags  are  preserved in this process.  Note that most GIS formats (such as Shapefiles, etc.)  do not
       support arbitrary tags.  Transformation into other GIS formats will need extra steps mapping  tags  to  a
       limited list of attributes.  This is outside the scope of this command.

       The  <b>osmium</b> <b>export</b> command has to keep an index of the node locations in memory or in a temporary file on
       disk while doing its work.  There are several  different  ways  it  can  do  that  which  have  different
       advantages   and   disadvantages.    The   default   is   good   enough  for  most  cases,  but  see  the
       <b><a href="../man5/osmium-index-types.5.html">osmium-index-types</a></b>(5) man page for details.

       Objects with invalid geometries are silently omitted from the output.  This is the  case  for  ways  with
       less than two nodes or closed ways or relations that can’t be assembled into a valid (multi)polygon.  See
       the options <b>--show-errors/-e</b> and <b>--stop-on-error/-E</b> for how to modify this behaviour.

       The  input file will be read twice (once for the relations, once for nodes and ways), so this command can
       not read its input from STDIN.

       This command will not work on full history files.

       This command will work with negative IDs on OSM objects (for instance on files created with JOSM).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -c, --config=FILE
              Read configuration from specified file.

       -C, --print-default-config
              Print the default config to STDOUT.  Useful if you want to change it and not write the whole thing
              manually.  If you use this option all other options are ignored.

       -e, --show-errors
              Output any geometry errors on STDERR.  This includes ways with a single node or areas  that  can’t
              be  assembled  from  multipolygon relations.  This output is not suitable for automated use, there
              are other tools that can create very detailed  errors  reports  that  are  better  for  that  (see
              https://osmcode.org/osm-area-tools/).

       -E, --stop-on-error
              Usually  geometry  errors  (due  to missing node locations or broken polygons) are ignored and the
              features are omitted from the output.  If this option is set, any error will immediately stop  the
              program.

       --geometry-types=TYPES
              Specify  the  geometry  types that should be written out.  Usually all created geometries (points,
              linestrings, and (multi)polygons) are written to the output, but you can restrict the types  using
              this option.  TYPES is a comma-separated list of the types (“point”, “linestring”, and “polygon”).

       -a, --attributes=ATTRS
              In  addition  to tags, also export attributes specified in this comma-separated list.  By default,
              none are exported.  See the <b>ATTRIBUTES</b>  section  below  for  the  known  attributes  list  and  an
              explanation.

       -i, --index-type=TYPE
              Set the index type.  For details see the <b><a href="../man5/osmium-index-types.5.html">osmium-index-types</a></b>(5) man page.

       -I, --show-index-types
              Shows  a  list  of available index types.  For details see the <b><a href="../man5/osmium-index-types.5.html">osmium-index-types</a></b>(5) man page.  If
              you use this options all other options are ignored.

       -n, --keep-untagged
              If this is set, features without any tags will be in the exported data.  By default these features
              will be omitted from the output.  Tags are the OSM tags, not attributes (like  id,  version,  uid,
              ...)  without the tags removed by the <b>exclude_tags</b> or <b>include_tags</b> settings.

       -u, --add-unique-id=TYPE
              Add  a unique ID to each feature.  TYPE can be either <u>counter</u> in which case the first feature will
              get ID 1, the next ID 2 and so on.  The type of object does not matter in this case.  Or the  TYPE
              is  <u>type_id</u>  in  which case the ID is a string, the first character is the type of object (`n' for
              nodes, `w' for linestrings created  from  ways,  and  `a'  for  areas  created  from  ways  and/or
              relations,  after that there is a unique ID based on the original OSM object ID(s).  For nodes and
              ways the numeric part of the ID is identical to the original node or way ID.  For areas, the ID is
              calculated from the original ID, for ways it is twice the original ID, for relations it  is  twice
              the original ID plus one.  If the input file has negative IDs, this can create IDs such as `w-12'.

       -x, --format-option=OPTION(=VALUE)
              Set  an  output format option.  The options available depend on the output format.  See the <b>OUTPUT</b>
              <b>FORMAT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> section for available options.  If the VALUE is not set, the OPTION will be set  to
              “true”.  If needed you can specify this option multiple times to set several options.  Options set
              on the command line overwrite options set in the config file.

</pre><h4><b>COMMON</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -h, --help
              Show usage help.

       -v, --verbose
              Set verbose mode.  The program will output information about what it is doing to STDERR.

       --progress
              Show  progress bar.  Usually a progress bar is only displayed if STDOUT and STDERR are detected to
              be TTY.  With this option a progress bar is always shown.  Note that a progress bar will never  be
              shown when reading from STDIN or a pipe.

       --no-progress
              Do  not  show progress bar.  Usually a progress bar is displayed if STDOUT and STDERR are detected
              to be a TTY.  With this option the progress bar is suppressed.  Note  that  a  progress  bar  will
              never be shown when reading from STDIN or a pipe.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -F, --input-format=FORMAT
              The  format of the input file(s).  Can be used to set the input format if it can’t be autodetected
              from the file name(s).  This will set the format for all input files, there is no way to  set  the
              format for some input files only.  See <b><a href="../man5/osmium-file-formats.5.html">osmium-file-formats</a></b>(5) or the libosmium manual for details.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -f, --output-format=FORMAT
              The  format  of  the  output  file.   Can  be  used  to  set the output file format if it can’t be
              autodetected from the output file name.  See the OUTPUT FORMATS section for a list of formats.

       --fsync
              Call fsync after writing the output file to force flushing buffers to disk.

       -o, --output=FILE
              Name of the output file.  Default is `-' (STDOUT).

       -O, --overwrite
              Allow an existing output file to be overwritten.  Normally <b>osmium</b> will refuse  to  write  over  an
              existing file.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIG</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The  config  file  is  in  JSON format.  The top-level is an object which contains the following optional
       names:

       • attributes: An object specifying which attributes  of  OSM  objects  to  export.   See  the  ATTRIBUTES
         section.

       • format_options: An object specifying output format options.  The options available depend on the output
         format.   See  the  <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FORMAT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> section for available options.  These options can also be set
         using the command line option <b>--format-option/-x</b>.

       • linear_tags: An expression specifying tags that should be  treated  as  linear  tags.   See  below  for
         details and also look at the AREA HANDLING section.

       • area_tags:  An  expression  specifying tags that should be treated as area tags.  See below for details
         and also look at the AREA HANDLING section.

       • exclude_tags: A list of tag expressions.  Tags matching these expressions are excluded from the output.
         See the FILTER EXPRESSION section.

       • include_tags: A list of tag expressions.  Tags matching these expressions are included in  the  output.
         See the FILTER EXPRESSION section.

       The area_tags and linear_tags can have the following values:

       true   All  tags  match.  (An empty list [] can also be used to mean the same, but this use is deprecated
              because it can be confusing.)

       false  No tags match.

       Array  The array contains one or more expressions as described in the FILTER EXPRESSION section.

       null   If the area_tags or linear_tags is set to null or not set at all, the inverse of the other setting
              is used.  So if you do not set the linear_tags but have some expressions in area_tags, areas  will
              be  created  for all objects matching those expressions and linestrings for everything else.  This
              can be simpler, because you only have to keep one list, but  in  cases  where  an  object  can  be
              interpreted as both an area and a linestring, only one interpretation will be used.

       The  exclude_tags and include_tags options are mutually exclusive.  If you want to just exclude some tags
       but leave most tags untouched, use the exclude_tags setting.  If you only want a defined  list  of  tags,
       use include_tags.

       When no config file is specified, the following settings are used:

              {
                  "attributes": {
                      "type":      false,
                      "id":        false,
                      "version":   false,
                      "changeset": false,
                      "timestamp": false,
                      "uid":       false,
                      "user":      false,
                      "way_nodes": false
                  },
                  "format_options": {
                  },
                  "linear_tags":  true,
                  "area_tags":    true,
                  "exclude_tags": [],
                  "include_tags": []
              }

</pre><h4><b>FILTER</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       A filter expression specifies a tag or tags that should be matched in the data.

       Some examples:

       amenity
              Matches all objects with the key “amenity”.

       highway=primary
              Matches all objects with the key “highway” and value “primary”.

       highway!=primary
              Matches all objects with the key “highway” and a value other than “primary”.

       type=multipolygon,boundary
              Matches all objects with key “type” and value “multipolygon” or “boundary”.

       name,name:de=Kastanienallee,Kastanienstrasse
              Matches   any  object  with  a  “name”  or  “name:de”  tag  with  the  value  “Kastanienallee”  or
              “Kastanienstrasse”.

       addr:* Matches all objects with any key starting with “addr:”

       name=*Paris
              Matches all objects with a name that contains the word “Paris”.

       If there is no equal sign (“=”) in the expression only keys are matched and values can be  anything.   If
       there  is  an  equal sign (“=”) in the expression, the key is to the left and the value to the right.  An
       exclamation sign (“!”) before the equal sign means: A tag with that key, but  not  the  value(s)  to  the
       right  of  the  equal  sign.   A  leading  or trailing asterisk (“*”) can be used for substring or prefix
       matching, respectively.  Commas (“,”) can be used to separate several keys or values.

       All filter expressions are case-sensitive.  There is no way to escape the special characters such as “=”,
       “*” and “,”.  You can not mix comma-expressions and “*”-expressions.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       All OSM objects (nodes, ways, and relations) have <u>attributes</u>, areas inherit  their  attributes  from  the
       ways and/or relations they were created from.  The attributes known to osmium export are:

       • type (`node', `way', or `relation')

       • id (64 bit object ID)

       • version (version number)

       • changeset (changeset ID)

       • timestamp (time of object creation in seconds since Jan 1 1970)

       • uid (user ID)

       • user (user name)

       • way_nodes (ways only, array with node IDs)

       For  areas,  the type will be way or relation if the area was created from a closed way or a multipolygon
       or boundary relation, respectively.  The id for areas is the id of the closed way or the multipolygon  or
       boundary relation.

       By  default the attributes will not be in the export, because they are not necessary for most uses of OSM
       data.  If you are interested in some (or all) attributes, add an attributes object to  the  config  file.
       Add  a member for each attribute you are interested in, the value can be either false (do not output this
       attribute), true (output this attribute with the attribute name prefixed by the @ sign) or any string, in
       which case the string will be used as the attribute name.

       Another option is to specify  attributes  list  in  a  comma-separated  string  for  the  <b>--attributes/-a</b>
       command-line  option.   This  way  you  cannot  control column names, but also you won’t have to create a
       config file.

       Depending on your choice of values for the attributes objects, attributes can have the same name  as  tag
       keys.   If this is the case, the conflicting tag is silently dropped.  So if there is a tag “@id=foo” and
       you have set id to true in the attributes object, the tag will not show up in the output.

       Note that the id is not necessarily unique.  Even the combination type and id is not  unique,  because  a
       way may end up in the output file as LineString and as (Multi)Polygon.  See the <b>--add-unique-id/-u</b> option
       for a unique ID.

</pre><h4><b>AREA</b> <b>HANDLING</b></h4><pre>
       Multipolygon  relations  will  be assembled into multipolygon geometries forming areas.  Some closed ways
       will also form areas.  Here are the detailed rules:

       Non-closed way
              A non-closed way (with the last node location not the same as the first node location)  is  always
              (regardless of any tags) a linestring, not an area.

       Relation
              A  relation tagged type=multipolygon or type=boundary is always (regardless of any tags) assembled
              into an area.

       Closed way
              For a closed way (with the last node location the same as the first node location)  the  tags  are
              checked:  If  the  way  has an area=yes tag, an area is created.  If the way has an area=no tag, a
              linestring is created.  An area  tag  with  a  value  other  than  yes  or  no  is  ignored.   The
              configuration settings area_tags and linear_tags can be used to augment the area check.  If any of
              the tags matches the area_tags, an area is created.  If any of the tags matches the linear_tags, a
              linestring  is  created.   If  both match, an area and a linestring is created.  This is important
              because some objects have tags that make them both, an area and a linestring.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       The following output formats are supported:

       • geojson (alias: json): GeoJSON (RFC7946).  The output file  will  contain  a  single  FeatureCollection
         object.  This is the default format.

       • geojsonseq  (alias:  jsonseq):  GeoJSON Text Sequence (RFC8142).  Each line (beginning with a RS (0x1e,
         record separator) and ending in a linefeed character) contains one GeoJSON object.  Used for  streaming
         GeoJSON.

       • pg: PostgreSQL COPY text format.  One line per object containing the WGS84 geometry as WKB, the tags in
         JSON  format  and,  optionally,  more  columns  for  id  and  attributes.  You have to create the table
         manually, then use the PostgreSQL COPY command to import the data.  Enable verbose output  to  see  the
         SQL commands needed to create the table and load the data.

       • text (alias: txt): A simple text format with the geometry in WKT format followed by the comma-delimited
         tags.  This is mainly intended for debugging at the moment.  THE FORMAT MIGHT CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE!

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FORMAT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       • print_record_separator  (default:  true).   Set  to  false to not print the RS (0x1e, record separator)
         character when using the GeoJSON Text Sequence Format.  Ignored for other formats.

       • tags_type (default: jsonb).  Set to hstore to use HSTORE format instead of JSON/JSONB when using the Pg
         Format.  Ignored in other formats.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>osmium</b> <b>export</b> exits with exit code

       0      if everything went alright,

       1      if there was an error processing the data, or

       2      if there was a problem with the command line arguments.

</pre><h4><b>MEMORY</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>osmium</b> <b>export</b> will usually keep all node locations and all objects needed for  assembling  the  areas  in
       memory.    For   larger  data  files,  this  can  need  several  tens  of  GBytes  of  memory.   See  the
       <b><a href="../man5/osmium-index-types.5.html">osmium-index-types</a></b>(5) man page for details.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Export into GeoJSON format:

              osmium export data.osm.pbf -o data.geojson

       Use a config file and export into GeoJSON Text Sequence format:

              osmium export data.osm.pbf -o data.geojsonseq -c export-config.json
