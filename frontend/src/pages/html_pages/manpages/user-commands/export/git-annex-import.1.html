</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       git-annex-import - import files from a special remote

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       git annex import --from remote branch[:subdir] | <b>[path</b> <b>...]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  command  is  a  way to import a tree of files from elsewhere into your git-annex repository. It can
       import files from a git-annex special remote, or from a directory.

</pre><h4><b>IMPORTING</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>A</b> <b>SPECIAL</b> <b>REMOTE</b></h4><pre>
       Importing from a special remote first downloads or hashes all new content from it, and then constructs  a
       git  commit  that  reflects  files  that have changed on the special remote since the last time git-annex
       looked at it.  Merging that commit into your repository will update it to reflect  changes  made  on  the
       special remote.

       This  way, something can be using the special remote for file storage, adding files, modifying files, and
       deleting files, and you can track those changes using git-annex.

       You can combine using <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>import</b> to fetch changes from a special remote with <b>git</b>  <b>annex</b>  <b>export</b>  to
       send your local changes to the special remote.

       You  can  only import from special remotes that were configured with <b>importtree=yes</b> when set up with <a href="../man1/gitannex-initremote.1.html">git-</a>
       <a href="../man1/gitannex-initremote.1.html">annex-initremote</a>(1). Only some kinds of special remotes will let you configure them this way.  A  perhaps
       non-exhaustive list is the directory, s3, and adb special remotes.

       To  import from a special remote, you must specify the name of a branch.  A corresponding remote tracking
       branch will be updated by <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>import</b>.  After that point, it's the same as if  you  had  run  a  <b>git</b>
       <b>fetch</b> from a regular git remote; you can merge the changes into your currently checked out branch.

       For example:

        git annex import master --from myremote
        git annex merge --allow-unrelated-histories myremote/master

       You  could just as well use <b>git</b> <b>merge</b> <b>--allow-unrelated-histories</b> <b>myremote/master</b> as the second step, but
       using <b>git-annex</b> <b>merge</b> avoids a couple of gotchas.  When using adjusted branches, it  adjusts  the  branch
       before merging from it.

       The  --allow-unrelated-histories  option  is  needed  for  at least the first merge of an imported remote
       tracking branch, since the branch's history is not connected.  Think  of  this  as  the  remote  being  a
       separate git repository with its own files. If you first <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>export</b> files to a remote, and then <b>git</b>
       <b>annex</b> <b>import</b> from it, you won't need that option.

       You  can  import  into  a  subdirectory,  using the "branch:subdir" syntax. For example, if "camera" is a
       special remote that accesses a camera, and you want to import those into  the  photos  directory,  rather
       than to the root of your repository:

        git annex import master:photos --from camera
        git merge camera/master

       The  <b>git</b>  <b>annex</b>  <b>sync</b>  <b>--content</b>  command (and the git-annex assistant) can also be used to import from a
       special remote.  To do this, you need to configure "remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-tracking-branch" to tell it  what
       branch to track. For example:

        git config remote.myremote.annex-tracking-branch master
        git annex sync --content

       Any files that are gitignored will not be included in the import, but will be left on the remote.

       When  the  special  remote has a preferred content expression set by <a href="../man1/git-annex-wanted.1.html">git-annex-wanted</a>(1), that is used to
       pick which files to import from it. Files that are not preferred  content  of  the  remote  will  not  be
       imported from it, but will be left on the remote.

       So  for  example, a preferred content expression like <b>"include=*.jpeg</b> <b>or</b> <b>largerthan=100mb"</b> will make only
       jpegs and large files be imported.

       Parts of a preferred content expression that relate to the  key,  such  as  "copies="  are  ignored  when
       importing, because the key is not known before importing.

       Things  in  the  expression like "include=" match relative to the top of the tree of files on the remote,
       even when importing into a subdirectory.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>IMPORTING</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>A</b> <b>SPECIAL</b> <b>REMOTE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--content</b>, <b>--no-content</b>

              Controls whether annexed content is downloaded from the special remote.

              The default is to download content into the git-annex repository.

              With --no-content, git-annex keys are generated from information provided by the  special  remote,
              without  downloading  it.  Commands  like  <b>git-annex</b>  <b>get</b>  can later be used to download files, as
              desired.  The --no-content option is not supported by all special remotes.

       <b>--message=msg</b> <b>-m</b> <b>msg</b>
              Use this option to specify a commit message for the changes that have been  made  to  the  special
              remote since the last import from it.

              If multiple -m options are given, their values are concatenated as separate paragraphs.

</pre><h4><b>IMPORTING</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>A</b> <b>DIRECTORY</b></h4><pre>
       When  run  with a path, <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>import</b> **moves** files from somewhere outside the git working copy, and
       adds them to the annex. In contrast to importing from a special  directory  remote,  imported  files  are
       **deleted from the given path**.

       This  is  a  legacy  interface.  It is still supported, but please consider switching to importing from a
       directory special remote instead, using the interface documented above.

       Individual files to import can be specified. If  a  directory  is  specified,  the  entire  directory  is
       imported. Please note that the following instruction will **delete all files from the source directory**.

        git annex import /media/camera/DCIM/*

       When  importing  files, there's a possibility of importing a duplicate of a file that is already known to
       git-annex -- its content is either present in the local repository already, or git-annex knows of another
       repository that contains it, or it was present in the annex before but has been removed now.

       By default, importing a duplicate of a known file will result in  a  new  filename  being  added  to  the
       repository,  so  the  duplicate file is present in the repository twice. (With all checksumming backends,
       including the default SHA256E, only one copy of the data will be stored.)

       Several options can be used to adjust  handling  of  duplicate  files,  see  <b>--duplicate</b>,  <b>--deduplicate</b>,
       <b>--skip-duplicates</b>, <b>--clean-duplicates</b>, and <b>--reinject-duplicates</b> documentation below.

       symbolic  links  in  the  directory  being  imported  are skipped to avoid accidentially importing things
       outside the directory that import was ran on. The directory that import is run on can, however inself  be
       a symbolic link, and that symbolic link will be followed.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>IMPORTING</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>A</b> <b>DIRECTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--duplicate</b>

              Do not delete files from the import location.

              Running  with this option repeatedly can import the same files into different git repositories, or
              branches, or different locations in a git repository.

       <b>--deduplicate</b>
              Only import files that are not duplicates;  duplicate  files  will  be  deleted  from  the  import
              location.

       <b>--skip-duplicates</b>
              Only import files that are not duplicates. Avoids deleting any files from the import location.

       <b>--clean-duplicates</b>
              Does  not  import  any  files,  but any files found in the import location that are duplicates are
              deleted.

       <b>--reinject-duplicates</b>
              Imports files that are not duplicates. Files that are duplicates  have  their  content  reinjected
              into the annex (similar to <a href="../man1/git-annex-reinject.1.html">git-annex-reinject</a>(1)).

       <b>--force</b>
              Allow existing files to be overwritten by newly imported files.

              Also, causes .gitignore to not take effect when adding files.

       file matching options
              Many of the <a href="../man1/git-annex-matching-options.1.html">git-annex-matching-options</a>(1) can be used to specify files to import.

                    git annex import /dir --include='*.png'

</pre><h4><b>COMMON</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--jobs=N</b> <b>-JN</b>

              Imports multiple files in parallel. This may be faster.  For example: <b>-J4</b>

              Setting this to "cpus" will run one job per CPU core.

       <b>--backend</b>
              Specifies which key-value backend to use for the imported files.

       <b>--no-check-gitignore</b>
              Add gitignored files.

       <b>--json</b> Enable  JSON  output.  This  is intended to be parsed by programs that use git-annex. Each line of
              output is a JSON object.

       <b>--json-progress</b>
              Include progress objects in JSON output.

       <b>--json-error-messages</b>
              Messages that would normally be output to standard error are included in the JSON instead.

       Also the <a href="../man1/git-annex-common-options.1.html">git-annex-common-options</a>(1) can be used.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Note that using <b>--deduplicate</b> or <b>--clean-duplicates</b> with the WORM backend does not look at file  content,
       but filename and mtime.

       If  annex.largefiles  is  configured,  and does not match a file, git annex import will add the non-large
       file directly to the git repository, instead of to the annex.
