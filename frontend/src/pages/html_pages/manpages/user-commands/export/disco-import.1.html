</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       disco-import - import and update DiscoDOS releases and tracks

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>disco</b> <u>import</u> [<b>--help</b>] [<b>--add-to-collection</b> | <b>--tracks</b> | <b>--brainz</b>] [<b>--resume</b>] [<u>RELEASE_ID</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       the  <b>import</b>  command imports your whole Discogs collection or just single releases and tracks. It is also
       used to get extended track information from Discogs, MusicBrainz and AcousticBrainz  (BPM,  musical  key,
       links to MusicBrainz releases and recordings, links to AcousticBrainz recordings).

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       [<u>RELEASE_ID</u>]
               the  Discogs release ID you want to import to DiscoBASE. If left empty, the whole collection will
               be imported. If the additional option
       <b>-a</b> is used, the release will be added to your Discogs collection _and_ imported to DiscoBASE. Note that a
       regular import of a given release ID is quite time consuming: We have to check wether or not this release
       ID is already in the Discogs collection (we don't want duplicates), thus we have to run  through  all  of
       your  releases  via the Discogs API. Unfortunately Discogs does not allow us to search for release IDs in
       our collection, we only can "iterate" through them. Therefore the recommended way of adding newly  gained
       releases is by using the <b>-a</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
               show this help message and exit

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--add-to-collection</b>
               This is the recommended (and fastest) way of adding newly gained releases to your collection. The
               given  release  ID  is  added  to  your  Discogs  collection  (same  as when you click an "Add to
               collection" in the Discogs Webinterface. Additionally the release is added to the DiscoBASE. Note
               that for performance's sake, we don't do a time-consuming check if the release is already in your
               Discogs collection by asking the Discogs API, but only do a quick check if the ID is in the local
               DiscoBASE already.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--tracks</b>
               extends the Discogs import (releases and also tracks will be downloaded)  -  takes  siginficantly
               longer than the regular import. Note: This is the same as " disco search all <b>-u</b> ".

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--brainz</b>
               imports  additional  information  from MusicBrainz/AcousticBrainz. This action takes a long time.
               <b>-z</b> quick match, <b>-zz</b> detailed match (takes even longer, but more results). Notes: This is the same
               as " disco search all <b>-z</b> ". Prior to using this option, an extended Discogs import is recommended
               (disco import <b>--tracks</b> ). Otherwise only tracks that were already downloaded to the DiscoBASE (eg
               used in mixes and updated using " disco mix <b>-u</b> ") will be updated.

       <b>--resume</b> <u>OFFSET</u>
               resumes long-running processes at the given offset position (expects a number). You  can  combine
               this option currently with the *Brainz matching import operation only ( <b>-z</b> , <b>-zz</b> )
