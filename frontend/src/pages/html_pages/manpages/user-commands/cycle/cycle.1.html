</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cycle - a calendar for women

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cycle</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Cycle  is  a  calendar  program for women. Given a cycle length or statistics for several periods, it can
       calculate the days until menstruation, the days of "safe" sex,  the  fertile  period,  and  the  days  to
       ovulations, and define the d.o.b. (date of birth) of a child. It allows the user to write notes and helps
       to supervise the reception of hormonal contraceptive tablets.

</pre><h4><b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       The program is capable of:

        - Calculate of the days of menstruation, based on length of the cycle or on statistics of a period.
        - Calculate the "safe" sex days, fertile period and day to ovulations
        - Definition of D.O.B . (Date Of Birth) of a child
        - Allows one to write notes
        - Helps to supervise reception of hormonal contraceptive tablets

</pre><h4><b>HOW</b> <b>DOES</b> <b>IT</b> <b>WORK</b></h4><pre>
       It  uses  the  calendar  method  for  the  definition of fertile days. For this is necessary to determine
       duration, at least, of last six cycles. For determine the fertile days it uses this algorithm:

        - First day: duration of shortest cycle minus 18
        - Last day: duration of longest cycle minus 11
        - Ovulation: is considered in the middle of fertile period (Determine the exact day isn't possible  with
       the calendar method)

       Date  of  a  birth  of  the  child  is counted from the beginning of last menstruation (in obstetrics are
       accepted 40 weeks). This date is corrected with the duration of a cycle (are  subtracted  or  added  same
       number   of   days   that   a   cycle   differs  from  28  days).  Is  possible  check  the  results  at:
       <a href="http://cir.msk.ru/sroki.shtml">http://cir.msk.ru/sroki.shtml</a> (in Russian)

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       It is necessary to mark the beginning of menstruation. This is possible clicking with the right button on
       the date and choosing "The beginning of a cycle". Similarly the mark can be removed.  Using  duration  of
       last six cycles, the program will calculate

        - Fertile period - green cells
        - Ovulation day (the middle fertile period) - brightly green cell
        - Beginning of following menstruation - pink cells

       Cycle duration is set in options or is calculated an average of last six periods.

       To determine prospective date of a birth of the child, it is necessary first day of last cycle to mark in
       addition as "Pregnancy".

       Depending  on your purposes, you can display only "Safe" sex days or only fertile days. Information about
       interesting day can be received clicking with left button.

       Is possible adding a note to any date using  corresponding  item  of  the  menu.  Day  with  a  note  are
       underlined.

       It  is  necessary  to  note that factor of failures of calendar contraception method is about 10 percent.
       This method is suitable only for women with enough regular cycle.

       If your doctor has  recommended  hormonal  contraceptive  this  program  will  help  to  supervise  their
       reception.  Closely  familiarize  with  the  instruction  applied  to the chosen preparation. Packing can
       contain 21 tablet (the circuit of reception 21 day on one tablet, then 7 days pause)  or  28  tablets  in
       this  case  all tablets are accepted without interruption every day of 28. In the program, is marked only
       day of reception of each first tablet of packing.

       NOTE: This program is not a reliable contraceptive  method.  It  does  neither  help  to  prevent  sexual
       transmision  diseases  like AIDS. It is just an electronic means of keeping track of some of your medical
       data and extract some statistical conclusions from them. You cannot consider this program as a substitute
       for your gynecologist in any way.
