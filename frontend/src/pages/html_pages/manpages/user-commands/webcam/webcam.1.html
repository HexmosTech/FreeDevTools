</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       webcam - capture images and upload them to a webserver using ftp

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>webcam</b> <b>[</b> <b>config</b> <b>file</b> <b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>webcam</b>  captures  images  from  a  video4linux device like bttv, annotates them and and uploads them to a
       webserver using ftp in a endless loop.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       At startup <b>webcam</b> reads the configuration from the given config file or <a href="file:~/.webcamrc">~/.webcamrc</a> if none is  specified
       in the command line.

       The  config  file has at least two sections.  The "grab" section holds the capture parameters.  Any other
       section describes where the image should be uploaded.   Older  versions  used  "ftp"  as  name  for  that
       section.   Recently  the  webcam  utility  got support for multiple connections, thus any section name is
       accepted and you can have more than one ftp section (you have  to  use  another  name  for  each  section
       througth, name them by upload servers for example).

       Here is an sample config file (the given values are the defaults):

       [grab]
       device = /dev/video0
       driver = libv4l
       text = "webcam %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
       infofile = filename
       fg_red = 255
       fg_green = 255
       fg_blue = 255
       width = 320
       height = 240
       delay = 3
       wait = 0
       input = composite1
       norm = pal
       rotate = 0
       top = 0
       left = 0
       bottom = -1
       right = -1
       quality = 75
       trigger = 0
       once = 0

       [ftp]
       host = www
       user = webcam
       pass = xxxxxx
       dir  = public_html/images
       file = webcam.jpeg
       tmp  = uploading.jpeg
       passive = 1
       debug = 0
       auto = 0
       local = 0
       ssh = 0

       The  annotation <b>text</b> is processed with strftime.  Check the <a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a>(3) or <a href="../man1/date.1.html">date</a>(1) manpage to see how you
       can format the timestamps.  The text can also be read from a extern file (use <b>infofile</b>  for  that).   The
       default  color for the text overlay is white (RGB=255,255,255). Entries in the range of 0 through 255 for
       <b>fg_red,</b> <b>fg_green,</b> and <b>fg_blue</b> can be used to define a different color.  Likewise  <b>bg_red,</b>  <b>bg_green,</b>  and
       <b>bg_blue</b> can be used to set the background color (which defaults to transparent).

       <b>input</b>  is  the  video  source  (TV/composite/whatever), <b>norm</b> the TV norm.  <b>delay</b> is the delay between two
       images in seconds.  <b>wait</b> is the initial delay before the first image is grabbed (some cameras  need  some
       time  for  adapting  to  lightning, thus don't return images with reasonable quality within the first few
       seconds ...).  <b>quality</b> is the JPEG quality for the stored images.

       <b>top,</b> <b>bottom,</b> <b>left,</b> and <b>right</b> in the grab section allow cropping the image  after  it  is  grabbed.   They
       should satisfy 0&lt;=top&lt;bottom&lt;=height and 0&lt;=left&lt;right&lt;=width.  (0,0 is the top, left corner.)  If <b>rotate</b>
       is positive, the output image will be rotated counter-clockwise 90 degrees that number of times (1, 2, or
       3).

       With  <b>trigger</b>  set  to a non-zero value webcam will upload the image only if the content of the image has
       changed.  It just looks for the maximum difference between the last uploaded and current image and if  it
       is greater than the specified value the image will be uploaded.  If <b>once</b> is set to 1 webcam will upload a
       single frame and quit.

       <b>archive</b>  can be used to create a (local) archive of the webcam images.  Just specify the filename for the
       files as argument.  The filename will be processed with <a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a>(3), so you can use the place  the  usual
       time  format  controls  into the string to get unique filenames.  Non-existing directories are created if
       needed.

       If <b>debug</b> in the ftp section is set to 1 the complete communication between webcam and the ftp utility  is
       printed  to stderr.  <b>auto</b> enables autologin via <a href="file:~/.netrc">~/.netrc</a> (starts the ftp utility without the '-n' switch,
       check the <a href="../man1/ftp.1.html">ftp</a>(1) man page for more info about the <a href="file:~/.netrc">~/.netrc</a> file).  If <b>local</b> in the ftp  section  is  non-
       zero,  files will be stored locally (using the <b>dir,</b> <b>tmp,</b> and <b>file</b> parameters) rather than ftped.  <b>ssh</b> set
       to non-zero makes webcam use ssh instead of ftp.

</pre><h4><b>CORRECTION</b> <b>OF</b> <b>DISTORTION</b></h4><pre>
       contributed by Frederic Helin, the parameters belong into the [grab] section of the config file too.

       <b>distor</b> <b>=</b> <b>1</b>
              If distor param is set to 1, the correction of distortion works.

       <b>distor_k</b> <b>=</b> <b>700</b>
              This is the coefficient of distortion. This algorithm is based on the paper "Correcting Distortion
              of Image by Image Registration" of Toru Tamaki, Tsuyoshi Yamamura and Noboru  Ahnishi.  More  your
              lens  has  an important distortion, more 'distor_k' must be neared of 0. 700 is the default value.
              Coefficient k of program is x100 than article.

       <b>distor_cx</b> <b>=</b> <b>192</b>

       <b>distor_cy</b> <b>=</b> <b>144</b>
              Coordinates of the lens optical axis: width/2 and  height/2  are  the  default  values.  The  axis
              doesn't go through the image center. So, you can change its coordinates around the center of image
              to affine correction.

       <b>distor_zoom</b> <b>=</b> <b>30</b>
              Zoom  parameter  is  used to cache the distorted borders of image, if you don't like this. Default
              value is 100.

       <b>distor_sensorw</b> <b>=</b> <b>320</b>

       <b>distor_sensorh</b> <b>=</b> <b>240</b>
              Dimensions of camera sensor. Default values are for 1/4p sensor. This parameters used to have  the
              same k coefficient than article.
