       <b>datalad</b> <b>diff</b> - report differences between two states of a dataset (hierarchy)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>datalad</b>  <b>diff</b>  [-h]  [-f  REVISION]  [-t  REVISION]  [-d  DATASET]  [--annex  [{basic|availability|all}]]
              [--untracked {no|normal|all}] [-r] [-R LEVELS] [--version] [PATH ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The two to-be-compared states are given via the --from and --to options.   These  state  identifiers  are
       evaluated  in  the context of the (specified or detected) dataset. In the case of a recursive report on a
       dataset hierarchy, corresponding state pairs for any subdataset are determined from the subdataset record
       in the respective superdataset. Only changes recorded in a subdataset between these two  states  are  re‐
       ported, and so on.

       Any  paths  given  as additional arguments will be used to constrain the difference report. As with Git's
       diff, it will not result in an error when a path is specified that does not exist on the filesystem.

       Reports are very similar to those of the STATUS command, with the distinguished content types and  states
       being identical.

   <b>Examples</b>
       Show unsaved changes in a dataset::

        % datalad diff

       Compare a previous dataset state identified by shasum against current worktree::

        % datalad diff --from &lt;SHASUM&gt;

       Compare two branches against each other::

        % datalad diff --from branch1 --to branch2

       Show unsaved changes in the dataset and potential subdatasets::

        % datalad diff -r

       Show unsaved changes made to a particular file::

        % datalad diff &lt;path/to/file&gt;

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       PATH   path to constrain the report to. Constraints: value must be a string or value must be NONE

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>, <b>--help-np</b>
              show  this  help message. --help-np forcefully disables the use of a pager for displaying the help
              message

       <b>-f</b> REVISION, <b>--from</b> REVISION
              original state to compare to, as given by any identifier that Git understands. Constraints:  value
              must be a string [Default: 'HEAD']

       <b>-t</b> REVISION, <b>--to</b> REVISION
              state  to  compare against the original state, as given by any identifier that Git understands. If
              none is specified, the state of the working tree will be compared. Constraints: value  must  be  a
              string or value must be NONE

       <b>-d</b> <u>DATASET</u>, <b>--dataset</b> <u>DATASET</u>
              specify  the  dataset to query. If no dataset is given, an attempt is made to identify the dataset
              based on the current working directory. Constraints: Value must be a Dataset or a valid identifier
              of a Dataset (e.g. a path) or value must be NONE

       <b>--annex</b> [{basic|availability|all}]
              Switch whether to include information on the annex content of individual files in the  status  re‐
              port,  such as recorded file size. By default no annex information is reported (faster). Three re‐
              port modes are available: basic information like file size and key  name  ('basic');  additionally
              test whether file content is present in the local annex ('availability'; requires one or two addi‐
              tional  file  system stat calls, but does not call git-annex), this will add the result properties
              'has_content' (boolean flag) and 'objloc' (absolute path to an existing  annex  object  file);  or
              'all'  which  will  report  all available information (presently identical to 'availability'). The
              'basic' mode will be assumed when this option is given, but no  mode  is  specified.  Constraints:
              value must be one of ('basic', 'availability', 'all')

       <b>--untracked</b> {no|normal|all}
              If  and  how  untracked  content is reported when comparing a revision to the state of the working
              tree. 'no': no untracked content is reported; 'normal': untracked files and entire  untracked  di‐
              rectories  are  reported  as such; 'all': report individual files even in fully untracked directo‐
              ries. Constraints: value must be one of ('no', 'normal', 'all') [Default: 'normal']

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--recursive</b>
              if set, recurse into potential subdatasets.

       <b>-R</b> LEVELS, <b>--recursion-limit</b> LEVELS
              limit recursion into subdatasets to the given number of levels. Constraints: value  must  be  con‐
              vertible to type 'int' or value must be NONE

       <b>--version</b>
              show the module and its version which provides the command
