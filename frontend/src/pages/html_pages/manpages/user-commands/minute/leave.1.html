</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       leave — remind you when you have to leave

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>leave</b> [[<b>+</b>]<u>hhmm</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>leave</b>  waits until the specified time (within the next 12 hours), then reminds you that you have to leave
       by writing to the TTY that you executed <b>leave</b> on.

       You are reminded 5 minutes and 1 minute before the actual time, at the time, and every minute thereafter.
       When you log off, <b>leave</b> exits just before it would have printed the next message.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>hhmm</u>  The time of day is in the form <u>hhmm</u> where <u>hh</u> is a time in hours (on a 12 or 24 hour clock), and  <u>mm</u>
             are minutes.

             However,  all  times  are converted to a 12 hour clock, and assumed to be in the next 12 hours.  An
             attempt to set an alarm for farther into the future will be truncated to within the next 12 hours.

       <b>+</b>     If the time is preceded by ‘<b>+</b>’, the alarm will go off in hours and minutes from the current time.

       If no argument is given, <b>leave</b> prompts with "When do you have to leave?"  A reply of newline causes <b>leave</b>
       to exit, otherwise the reply is assumed to be a time.  This form is suitable for inclusion in a  <u><a href="file:~/.login">~/.login</a></u>
       or <u><a href="file:~/.profile">~/.profile</a></u>.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>leave</b> command appeared in 3.0BSD.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       In  the  modern  age  with  <u><a href="../man1/X.1.html">X</a></u>(1) and window multiplexing programs like <u><a href="../man1/window.1.html">window</a></u>(1) and <u><a href="../man1/screen.1.html">screen</a></u>(1), the <b>leave</b>
       command's reminders and admonitions might not be seen if the user has the window where <b>leave</b> was  started
       minimized or obscured.

       This all begs for a more general user notifications system to be implemented.
