</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       touch — change file access and modification times

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       touch <b>[</b>-acm<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-r <u>ref_file</u>|-t <u>time</u>|-d <u>date_time</u><b>]</b> <u>file</u>...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>touch</u> utility shall change the last data modification timestamps, the last data access timestamps, or
       both.

       The  time used can be specified by the <b>-t</b> <u>time</u> option-argument, the corresponding <u>time</u> fields of the file
       referenced by the <b>-r</b> <u>ref_file</u> option-argument, or the <b>-d</b> <u>date_time</u> option-argument, as specified  in  the
       following sections. If none of these are specified, <u>touch</u> shall use the current time.

       For  each  <u>file</u> operand, <u>touch</u> shall perform actions equivalent to the following functions defined in the
       System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017:

        1. If <u>file</u> does not exist:

            a. The <u>creat</u>() function is called with the following arguments:

               --  The <u>file</u> operand is used as the <u>path</u> argument.

               --  The value of the bitwise-inclusive OR of S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR,  S_IRGRP,  S_IWGRP,  S_IROTH,  and
                   S_IWOTH is used as the <u>mode</u> argument.

            b. The <u>futimens</u>() function is called with the following arguments:

               --  The file descriptor opened in step 1a.

               --  The  access time and the modification time, set as described in the OPTIONS section, are used
                   as the first and second elements of the <u>times</u> array argument, respectively.

        2. If <u>file</u> exists, the <u>utimensat</u>() function is called with the following arguments:

            a. The AT_FDCWD special value is used as the <u>fd</u> argument.

            b. The <u>file</u> operand is used as the <u>path</u> argument.

            c. The access time and the modification time, set as described in the OPTIONS section, are  used  as
               the first and second elements of the <u>times</u> array argument, respectively.

            d. The <u>flag</u> argument is set to zero.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>touch</u>  utility  shall  conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>12.2</u>, <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-a</b>        Change the access time of <u>file</u>.  Do  not  change  the  modification  time  unless  <b>-m</b>  is  also
                 specified.

       <b>-c</b>        Do  not  create  a  specified  <u>file</u>  if it does not exist. Do not write any diagnostic messages
                 concerning this condition.

       <b>-d</b> <u>date_time</u>
                 Use the specified <u>date_time</u> instead of the current time. The option-argument shall be a  string
                 of the form:

                     <u>YYYY</u>-<u>MM</u>-<u>DD</u>T<u>hh</u>:<u>mm</u>:<u>SS</u><b>[</b>.<u>frac</u><b>][</b><u>tz</u><b>]</b>

                 or:

                     <u>YYYY</u>-<u>MM</u>-<u>DD</u>T<u>hh</u>:<u>mm</u>:<u>SS</u><b>[</b>,<u>frac</u><b>][</b><u>tz</u><b>]</b>

                 where:

                  *  <u>YYYY</u> are at least four decimal digits giving the year.

                  *  <u>MM</u>, <u>DD</u>, <u>hh</u>, <u>mm</u>, and <u>SS</u> are as with <b>-t</b> <u>time</u>.

                  *  T is the time designator, and can be replaced by a single &lt;space&gt;.

                  *  [.<u>frac</u>] and [,<u>frac</u>] are either empty, or a &lt;period&gt; (<b>'.'</b>)  or a &lt;comma&gt; (<b>','</b>) respectively,
                     followed by one or more decimal digits, specifying a fractional second.

                  *  [<u>tz</u>]  is either empty, signifying local time, or the letter <b>'Z'</b>, signifying UTC. If [<u>tz</u>] is
                     empty, the resulting time shall be affected by the value of the <u>TZ</u> environment variable.

                 If the resulting time precedes the Epoch, the behavior is implementation-defined. If  the  time
                 cannot  be  represented  as  the  file's  timestamp, <u>touch</u> shall exit immediately with an error
                 status.

       <b>-m</b>        Change the modification time of <u>file</u>.  Do  not  change  the  access  time  unless  <b>-a</b>  is  also
                 specified.

       <b>-r</b> <u>ref_file</u>
                 Use  the  corresponding  time of the file named by the pathname <u>ref_file</u> instead of the current
                 time.

       <b>-t</b> <u>time</u>   Use the specified <u>time</u> instead of the current time. The  option-argument  shall  be  a  decimal
                 number of the form:

                     <b>[[</b><u>CC</u><b>]</b><u>YY</u><b>]</b><u>MMDDhhmm</u><b>[</b>.<u>SS</u><b>]</b>

                 where each two digits represents the following:

                 <u>MM</u>      The month of the year [01,12].

                 <u>DD</u>      The day of the month [01,31].

                 <u>hh</u>      The hour of the day [00,23].

                 <u>mm</u>      The minute of the hour [00,59].

                 <u>CC</u>      The first two digits of the year (the century).

                 <u>YY</u>      The second two digits of the year.

                 <u>SS</u>      The second of the minute [00,60].

                 Both <u>CC</u> and <u>YY</u> shall be optional. If neither is given, the current year shall be assumed. If <u>YY</u>
                 is specified, but <u>CC</u> is not, <u>CC</u> shall be derived as follows:
                                                  ┌───────────┬─────────────┐
                                                  │ <b>If</b> <u>YY</u> <b>is:</b> │ <u>CC</u> <b>becomes:</b> │
                                                  ├───────────┼─────────────┤
                                                  │  [69,99]  │     19      │
                                                  │  [00,68]  │     20      │
                                                  └───────────┴─────────────┘

                 <b>Note:</b>     It is expected that in a future version of this standard the default century inferred
                           from  a  2-digit  year  will  change.  (This  would apply to all commands accepting a
                           2-digit year as input.)

                 The resulting time shall be affected by the value  of  the  <u>TZ</u>  environment  variable.  If  the
                 resulting time value precedes the Epoch, the behavior is implementation-defined. If the time is
                 out  of  range for the file's timestamp, <u>touch</u> shall exit immediately with an error status. The
                 range of valid times past the Epoch is implementation-defined, but it shall extend to at  least
                 the  time  0  hours,  0  minutes,  0 seconds, January 1, 2038, Coordinated Universal Time. Some
                 implementations may not be able to represent dates beyond January 18, 2038,  because  they  use
                 <b>signed</b> <b>int</b> as a time holder.

                 The  range  for <u>SS</u> is [00,60] rather than [00,59] because of leap seconds. If <u>SS</u> is 60, and the
                 resulting time, as affected by the <u>TZ</u> environment variable, does not refer to  a  leap  second,
                 the resulting time shall be one second after a time where <u>SS</u> is 59. If <u>SS</u> is not given a value,
                 it is assumed to be zero.

       If neither the <b>-a</b> nor <b>-m</b> options were specified, <u>touch</u> shall behave as if both the <b>-a</b> and <b>-m</b> options were
       specified.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <u>file</u>      A pathname of a file whose times shall be modified.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>touch</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> for the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used  to affect the format and contents of diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

       <u>TZ</u>        Determine the timezone to be used for interpreting the <u>time</u> option-argument. If <u>TZ</u> is unset  or
                 null, an unspecified default timezone shall be used.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    The utility executed successfully and all requested changes were made.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The  interpretation  of  time  is taken to be <u>seconds</u> <u>since</u> <u>the</u> <u>Epoch</u> (see the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>4.16</u>, <u>Seconds</u> <u>Since</u> <u>the</u> <u>Epoch</u>).  It should be noted that implementations conforming
       to the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 do not take leap  seconds  into  account  when  computing
       seconds since the Epoch. When <u>SS</u>=60 is used, the resulting time always refers to 1 plus <u>seconds</u> <u>since</u> <u>the</u>
       <u>Epoch</u> for a time when <u>SS</u>=59.

       Although  the  <b>-t</b>  <u>time</u>  option-argument  specifies values in 1969, the access time and modification time
       fields are defined in terms of seconds since the Epoch (00:00:00  on  1  January  1970  UTC).  Therefore,
       depending  on  the  value of <u>TZ</u> when <u>touch</u> is run, there is never more than a few valid hours in 1969 and
       there need not be any valid times in 1969.

       If the <u>T</u> time designator is replaced by a &lt;space&gt; for the <b>-d</b> <u>date_time</u> option-argument, the &lt;space&gt;  must
       be quoted to prevent the shell from splitting the argument.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Create  or update a file called <b>dwc</b>; the resulting file has both the last data modification and last data
       access timestamps set to November 12, 2007 at 10:15:30 local time:

           touch -d 2007-11-12T10:15:30 dwc

       Create or update a file called <b>nick</b>; the resulting file has both the last data modification and last data
       access timestamps set to November 12, 2007 at 10:15:30 UTC:

           touch -d 2007-11-12T10:15:30Z nick

       Create or update a file called <b>gwc</b>; the resulting file has both the last data modification and last  data
       access  timestamps  set to November 12, 2007 at 10:15:30 local time with a fractional second timestamp of
       .002 seconds:

           touch -d 2007-11-12T10:15:30,002 gwc

       Create or update a file called <b>ajosey</b>; the resulting file has both the last data  modification  and  last
       data  access  timestamps  set  to November 12, 2007 at 10:15:30 UTC with a fractional second timestamp of
       .002 seconds:

           touch -d "2007-11-12 10:15:30.002Z" ajosey

       Create or update a file called <b>cathy</b>; the resulting file has both the last  data  modification  and  last
       data access timestamps set to November 12, 2007 at 10:15:00 local time:

           touch -t 200711121015 cathy

       Create  or  update a file called <b>drepper</b>; the resulting file has both the last data modification and last
       data access timestamps set to November 12, 2007 at 10:15:30 local time:

           touch -t 200711121015.30 drepper

       Create or update a file called <b>ebb9</b>; the resulting file has both the last data modification and last data
       access timestamps set to November 12, 2007 at 10:15:30 local time:

           touch -t 0711121015.30 ebb9

       Create or update a file called <b>eggert</b>; the resulting file has the last data access timestamp set  to  the
       corresponding  time of the file named <b>mark</b> instead of the current time. If the file exists, the last data
       modification time is not changed:

           touch -a -r mark eggert

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The functionality of <u>touch</u> is described almost entirely through references to  functions  in  the  System
       Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017. In this way, there is no duplication of effort required for describing
       such side-effects as the relationship of user IDs to the user database, permissions, and so on.

       There are some significant differences between the <u>touch</u> utility in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 and those
       in  System  V  and  BSD  systems.  They  are  upwards-compatible  for  historical  applications from both
       implementations:

        1. In System V, an ambiguity exists when a pathname that is a decimal number leads the operands;  it  is
           treated  as  a time value. In BSD, no <u>time</u> value is allowed; files may only be <u>touch</u>ed to the current
           time. The <b>-t</b> <u>time</u> construct solves these problems for future conforming applications (note  that  the
           <b>-t</b> option is not historical practice).

        2. The  inclusion of the century digits, <u>CC</u>, is also new. Note that a ten-digit <u>time</u> value is treated as
           if <u>YY</u>, and not <u>CC</u>, were specified. The caveat about the  range  of  dates  following  the  Epoch  was
           included  as  recognition that some implementations are not able to represent dates beyond 18 January
           2038 because they use <b>signed</b> <b>int</b> as a time holder.

       The <b>-r</b> option was added because several comments requested this capability.  This option was named <b>-f</b>  in
       an  early  proposal,  but  was  changed  because the <b>-f</b> option is used in the BSD version of <u>touch</u> with a
       different meaning.

       At least one historical implementation of <u>touch</u> incremented the exit code if <b>-c</b>  was  specified  and  the
       file did not exist. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires exit status zero if no errors occur.

       In  previous version of the standard, if at least two operands are specified, and the first operand is an
       eight or ten-digit decimal integer, the first operand was assumed to be a <u>date_time</u> operand.  This  usage
       was removed in this version of the standard since it had been marked obsolescent previously.

       The  <b>-d</b>  <u>date_time</u>  format is an ISO 8601:2004 standard complete representation of date and time extended
       format with an optional decimal point or &lt;comma&gt; followed by a string of  digits  following  the  seconds
       portion  to specify fractions of a second. It is not necessary to recognize <b>"[+/-]hh:mm"</b> and <b>"[+/-]hh"</b> to
       specify timezones other than local time and UTC. The <u>T</u> time  designator  in  the  ISO 8601:2004  standard
       extended format may be replaced by &lt;space&gt;.
