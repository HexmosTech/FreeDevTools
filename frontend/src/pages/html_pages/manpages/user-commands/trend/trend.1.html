</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       trend — a general-purpose, efficient trend graph

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>trend</b>     [<b>-dDSsvlmFgGhtAERIMNTLzfcpue</b>]     [<b>-display</b>]     [<b>-geometry</b>]     [<b>-iconic</b>]     ⟨<u>fifo</u>    |    <u>-</u>⟩
             ⟨<u>hist-spec</u> | <u>hist-sz</u> <u>x-sz</u>⟩ [<u>low</u> <u>high</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>trend</b> is a general-purpose, efficient trend graph for "live" data. Data is read in ASCII form from a file
       or continuously from a FIFO and displayed  in  real-time  into  a  multi-pass  trend  (much  like  a  CRT
       oscilloscope).   <b>trend</b>  can  be  used  as a rapid analysis tool for progressive or time-based data series
       together with trivial scripting.

       <b>trend</b> requires at least a valid <u>fifo</u> to read from  and  an  history  specification  (<u>hist-spec</u>)  or,  for
       advanced  usage,  a  combination  of  history  size  and horizontal size (<u>hist-sz</u> and <u>x-sz</u> respectively).
       Optionally, to disable auto-scaling, the vertical limits can be specified directly  through  the  command
       line  via  <u>low</u> and <u>high</u>.  The default input format is ASCII, in absolute counting mode. Many settings can
       be changed directly during execution.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b></h4><pre>
   <b>FIFO</b>
       To display real-time data you should use a FIFO. Both  standard  input  and  named  pipes  can  be  used.
       Standard  input (used for simple pipelining purposes) can be opened by using <u>-</u> instead of a named file. A
       named FIFO can be created using the <u><a href="../man1/mkfifo.1.html">mkfifo</a></u>(1) command. FIFOs are automatically re-opened  upon  EOF.  See
       the “EXAMPLES” section.

       Alternatively  you  can  store  your  data  in  a  plain  file  and  simply  display its last values non-
       interactively.

       When new data is written, the value is plotted and the cursor position is advanced. That  is,  the  graph
       scrolling  speed is determined by the speed of the data flow. When the number of received values is above
       the specified horizontal size, the graph will wrap or scroll, depending on your settings.

   <b>ASCII</b> <b>DATA</b>
       The default data format is a space/tab/newline-separated series of parseable ASCII numbers; eg:

             1 2 3 4 5.1 0642
             0x12 -12.4E5 .987

       The parser is very lenient, and will silently ignore whatever looks like garbage.

   <b>COUNTING</b> <b>MODES</b>
       By default all input values are considered absolute and displayed "as is" in a single graph.

       The <b>-c</b> <u>[N]mode</u> flag sets an alternate counting mode and the number of available graphs.  Available  modes
       are:

             <u>a</u>    absolute (default)
             <u>i</u>    incremental counter
             <u>d</u>    differential values

       In  incremental  and  differential mode, each value is calculated using the previous value as a reference
       except for the first, which is taken as absolute. The number of graphs can be specified  by  prefixing  a
       multiplier before the counting mode (eg: <u>2a</u> draws two graphs in absolute mode). See “MULTIPLE GRAPHS” for
       more details on how this affects the input stream.

   <b>FORMAT</b> <b>TYPES</b>
       Different  input  formats  are  supported,  as specified by the <b>-f</b> flag. Note however that only the ASCII
       parser (the default) silently ignores errors. NaNs and Infinity have special treatment. Internally, <b>trend</b>
       always works with double precision floating points: conversion toward these is performed with the default
       FPU conversion rules. The actual underlying binary format depends on the host architecture:

             <u>a</u>    ASCII parser (default)
             <u>f</u>    binary float
             <u>d</u>    binary double
             <u>s</u>    binary short
             <u>i</u>    binary int
             <u>l</u>    binary long

   <b>SPECIAL</b> <b>VALUES</b>
       ASCII and binary floating point input have special treatment  for  NaNs  and  Infinity  (entered  in  any
       representable  form). Both are considered as "undefined values". Undefined values can be highlighted, but
       aren't otherwise rendered. If the <b>-e</b> flag is set, Infinity enters an escape sequence instead (See “ESCAPE
       SEQUENCES”)

   <b>MULTIPLE</b> <b>GRAPHS</b>
       Multiple graphs can be displayed inside a single trend instance by specifying a prefix number N  for  the
       <b>-c</b>  flag.  The input is interleaved, but otherwise unchanged: the reference value, if needed, is expected
       to be seen N times, one for each graph. Thus, for three graphs (A, B and C), the input order is:

             [A0 B0 C0]
             A1 B1 C1
             A2 B2 C2
             .. .. ..

       The display is updated only once all graph values are read. The color, label and origin  for  each  graph
       can  be  specified  through the usual command-line flags, separating each value with a comma; in the same
       order as the input. Default colors and labels are assigned if not completely specified.

       All graphs share and are affected by the same settings, except for the origin (zero) which can be changed
       independently. Filling, values and the examiners only work on the current graph. The current graph can be
       cycled dynamically with the <b>TAB</b> key and differentiated using the <b>K</b> key, which  cycles  between  "normal",
       "dim others" and "hide others" views. The graph key, if enabled, also highlights the current graph.

   <b>ESCAPE</b> <b>SEQUENCES</b>
       If escape sequences are enabled (through the <b>-e</b> flag), entering Infinity (in any representable form) will
       start  an  escape sequence. Currently, this feature is not yet implemented: Infinity is simply discarded.
       This is reserved for future use as a way to control the <b>trend</b> interface and parameters remotely.

   <b>HIST-SPEC</b>
       An history specification is another convenient form of defining the pair `hist-sz x-sz` for common cases.
       An history specification can be in either one of the following formats:

             <u>N</u>      Sets x-sz to N, and hist-sz to N+1.
             <u>N/M</u>    Sets hist-sz to N, and x-sz to N/M.
             <u>NxM</u>    Sets x-sz to N, and hist-sz to N*M.

       While this may seem hard at first, <b>trend</b> <b>fifo</b> <b>'60x3'</b> is an easier way of expressing  "60  seconds  for  3
       minutes" and similar idioms.

   <b>COLOUR</b>
       A colour is specified in hex RGB format, as follows: <b>#RRGGBB</b>, <b>RRGGBB</b> or <b>0xRRGGBB</b>; some examples:

             <b>#FF0000</b>    red
             <b>#00FF00</b>    green
             <b>#A020F0</b>    purple

   <b>GRID-SPEC</b>
       A grid specification is of the form:

             <b>[[A][+C]][x[B][+C]]</b>

       (eg: <b>1.3</b>, <b>10+5</b>, <b>1x10+5</b>, <b>+5x+5</b>; <b>+1x+1</b> gets the old behaviour) where:

             <u>A</u>    y grid resolution
             <u>B</u>    x grid resolution
             <u>C</u>    draw a mayor line every C normal grid lines

             <b>u</b>        toggle display of undefined values
             <b>k</b>        toggle the graph key
             <b>K</b>        cycle view mode (normal, dim others or hide others)
             <b>space</b>    pause visualisation (but still continue to consume input to preserve time coherency)

   <b>AUTOSCALING</b>
       When  autoscaling  is  enabled  the  graph  will  be  scaled  vertically  to fit visible values. The grid
       resolution is used to add some vertical bounds to the graph.  Disabling  autoscaling  interactively  will
       retain current limits. When the grid is too dense to be displayed it's deactivated automatically.

   <b>LATENCY</b> <b>INDICATOR</b>
       The  latency indicator shows a 5s average of the visual and maximal sync latency (in seconds). The visual
       latency is the time-frame between real value updates and the final  output  you're  seeing:  it  includes
       copy/redraw times, which varies depending on enabled layers, plus video sync. The maximal sync latency is
       the maximal time ever required for any received value to be synced with the display: since the display is
       updated  atomically,  values  received  while  redrawing  are implicitly delayed. See the “UPDATE POLICY”
       section for further details.

   <b>SHADING</b> <b>MODES</b>
       The default is to shade uniformly old values to complete transparency. The "dimmed"  shading  mode  draws
       the foreground values with full opacity and the others with half opacity.

   <b>SCROLLING</b> <b>MODES</b>
       The default visualisation mode is "wrap-around": newer values will simply wrap around the screen when new
       data  arrives. The other available one is "scrolling": new data is always placed at the right edge of the
       screen, and older values scrolled on the left.

   <b>VALUE</b> <b>INDICATORS</b>
       Three value indicators are drawn on the screen: upper limit, lower limit and current value  (respectively
       on the upper right, lower right and lower left of the screen).

   <b>INTERACTIVE</b> <b>EXAMINERS</b>
       You  can  query  interactively  the  graph  for any value in the history by clicking with the first mouse
       button. This will enable a permanent examiner in the selected  position  and  display  up  to  the  three
       nearest  values in the upper-left corner of the screen. Intersections are projected horizontally, while a
       small circle will show the position of the nearest sampled value. The mean  value  refers  to  the  three
       intersections.

       By holding down the CTRL key while clicking/dragging only "foreground" values will be considered.

       When  clicking  inside  the  distribution  graph,  the  current count for the selected value is displayed
       instead.

       The examiners can be removed by clicking anywhere with the third mouse button.

   <b>DISTRIBUTION</b> <b>GRAPH</b>
       <b>D</b> or <b>-D</b> enable a distribution graph on the left side of  the  window.  This  is  especially  useful  when
       analyzing the continuity of a function or signal. Intensity is proportional to the visible maximum.

   <b>FILLING</b>
       <b>f</b>  or  <b>-F</b>  enable  filling.  In standard mode, or when hist-sz is smaller than x-sz, the area between the
       curve and zero will be filled.  Otherwise,  in  dimmed  mode,  the  area  between  the  "foreground"  and
       "background" values is filled instead.

</pre><h4><b>UPDATE</b> <b>POLICY</b></h4><pre>
       The  fifo  is  read  and  managed  asynchronously  from  the graphics. Delays at the display end will not
       interfere with the data feed.

       The fifo is unbuffered and the feeder thread is synchronously locked on it waiting for new data.

       The value is put in the history buffer when a separator character is received after the  value,  or,  for
       binary input, when the needed amount of bytes is read (in this case each value is read with a single read
       call).

       The  polling  rate  (as  defined  by <b>p</b> or <b>-p</b> and defaulting to 1000) defines how often the history buffer
       should be checked for updates and kept in sync with the  visual.  Values  greater  than  1000  result  in
       continuous  scanning  (note  that  this  only affects the maximal sync latency, and not the display rate,
       which is handled automatically).

       Syncing occurs atomically, reflecting the actual state at the instant of the update. Scheduler  latencies
       apply.
