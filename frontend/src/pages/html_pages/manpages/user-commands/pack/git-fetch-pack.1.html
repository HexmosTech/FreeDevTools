       git-fetch-pack - Receive missing objects from another repository

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>git</u> <u>fetch-pack</u> [--all] [--quiet|-q] [--keep|-k] [--thin] [--include-tag]
               [--upload-pack=&lt;git-upload-pack&gt;]
               [--depth=&lt;n&gt;] [--no-progress]
               [-v] &lt;repository&gt; [&lt;refs&gt;...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Usually you would want to use <u>git</u> <u>fetch</u>, which is a higher level wrapper of this command, instead.

       Invokes <u>git-upload-pack</u> on a possibly remote repository and asks it to send objects missing from this
       repository, to update the named heads. The list of commits available locally is found out by scanning the
       local refs/ hierarchy and sent to <u>git-upload-pack</u> running on the other end.

       This command degenerates to download everything to complete the asked refs from the remote side when the
       local side does not have a common ancestor commit.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --all
           Fetch all remote refs.

       --stdin
           Take the list of refs from stdin, one per line. If there are refs specified on the command line in
           addition to this option, then the refs from stdin are processed after those on the command line.

           If <b>--stateless-rpc</b> is specified together with this option then the list of refs must be in packet
           format (pkt-line). Each ref must be in a separate packet, and the list must end with a flush packet.

       -q, --quiet
           Pass <b>-q</b> flag to <u>git</u> <u>unpack-objects</u>; this makes the cloning process less verbose.

       -k, --keep
           Do not invoke <u>git</u> <u>unpack-objects</u> on received data, but create a single packfile out of it instead,
           and store it in the object database. If provided twice then the pack is locked against repacking.

       --thin
           Fetch a "thin" pack, which records objects in deltified form based on objects not included in the
           pack to reduce network traffic.

       --include-tag
           If the remote side supports it, annotated tags objects will be downloaded on the same connection as
           the other objects if the object the tag references is downloaded. The caller must otherwise determine
           the tags this option made available.

       --upload-pack=&lt;git-upload-pack&gt;
           Use this to specify the path to <u>git-upload-pack</u> on the remote side, if it is not found on your $PATH.
           Installations of sshd ignores the userâ€™s environment setup scripts for login shells (e.g.
           .bash_profile) and your privately installed git may not be found on the system default $PATH. Another
           workaround suggested is to set up your $PATH in ".bashrc", but this flag is for people who do not
           want to pay the overhead for non-interactive shells by having a lean .bashrc file (they set most of
           the things up in .bash_profile).

       --exec=&lt;git-upload-pack&gt;
           Same as --upload-pack=&lt;git-upload-pack&gt;.

       --depth=&lt;n&gt;
           Limit fetching to ancestor-chains not longer than n.  <u>git-upload-pack</u> treats the special depth
           2147483647 as infinite even if there is an ancestor-chain that long.

       --shallow-since=&lt;date&gt;
           Deepen or shorten the history of a shallow repository to include all reachable commits after &lt;date&gt;.

       --shallow-exclude=&lt;ref&gt;
           Deepen or shorten the history of a shallow repository to exclude commits reachable from a specified
           remote branch or tag. This option can be specified multiple times.

       --deepen-relative
           Argument --depth specifies the number of commits from the current shallow boundary instead of from
           the tip of each remote branch history.

       --refetch
           Skips negotiating commits with the server in order to fetch all matching objects. Use to reapply a
           new partial clone blob/tree filter.

       --no-progress
           Do not show the progress.

       --check-self-contained-and-connected
           Output "connectivity-ok" if the received pack is self-contained and connected.

       -v
           Run verbosely.

       &lt;repository&gt;
           The URL to the remote repository.

       &lt;refs&gt;...
           The remote heads to update from. This is relative to $GIT_DIR (e.g. "HEAD", "refs/heads/master").
           When unspecified, update from all heads the remote side has.

           If the remote has enabled the options <b>uploadpack.allowTipSHA1InWant</b>,
           <b>uploadpack.allowReachableSHA1InWant</b>, or <b>uploadpack.allowAnySHA1InWant</b>, they may alternatively be
           40-hex sha1s present on the remote.
