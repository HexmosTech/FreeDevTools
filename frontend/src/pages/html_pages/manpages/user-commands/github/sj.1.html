</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sj - SugarJar, a Git/GitHub helper

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       sj &lt;command&gt; [&lt;args&gt;] [&lt;options&gt;]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Command, args, and options, can appear in any order.

   <b>OPTIONS:</b>
       <b>--[no-]fallthru</b>
              Fall-thru to git. [default: true]

       <b>--feature-prefix</b>
              Prefix to use for feature branches

       <b>--github-cli</b> CLI
              Github  CLI  to  use  ("gh"  or  "hub"  or  "auto").  Auto (the default) will prefer "gh" if it is
              available but will fall back to "hub." [default: "auto"]

       <b>--github-host</b> HOST
              The host for "hub". Note that we will set this in the local repo config so there  is  no  need  to
              have  multiple config files for multiple github servers. Put your default one in your config file,
              and simply specify this option the first time you clone or touch a repo and it  will  be  part  of
              that repo until changed.

       <b>--github-user</b> USER
              Github username

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print this help message

       <b>--ignore-dirty</b>
              Tell command that check for a dirty repo to carry on anyway. [default: false]

       <b>--ignore-prerun-failure</b>
              Ignore preprun failure on *push commands. [default: false]

       <b>--log-level</b> LEVEL
              Set  logging  level  (fatal,  error,  warning,  info,  debug, trace). This can also be set via the
              SUGARJAR_LOGLEVEL environment variable. [default: info]

       <b>--[no-]pr-autofill</b>
              When creating a PR, auto fill the title &amp; description from the top commit if we  are  using  "gh".
              [default: true]

       <b>--[no-]pr-autostack</b>
              When  creating  a  PR,  if  this  is a subfeature, should we make it a PR on the PR for the parent
              feature. If not specified, we prompt when this happens, when true always do this, when false never
              do this. Only applicable when usiing "gh" and on branch-based PRs.

       <b>--[no-]use-color</b>
              Enable color. [default: true]

       <b>--version</b>

   <b>COMMANDS:</b>
              amend

              Amend the current commit. Alias for "git commit <b>--amend</b>".  Accepts other arguments such as "-a" or
              files.

              amendq, qamend

              Same as "amend" but without changing the message. Alias for "git commit <b>--amend</b> <b>--no-edit</b>".

              bclean [&lt;branch&gt;]

              If safe, delete the current branch (or the specified branch).  Unlike "git branch <b>-d</b>", bclean  can
              handle squash-merged branches.  Think of it as a smarter "git branch <b>-d</b>".

              bcleanall

              Walk all branches, and try to delete them if it's safe. See "bclean" for details.

              binfo

              Verbose information about the current branch.

              br

              Verbose branch list. An alias for "git branch <b>-v</b>".

              feature, f &lt;branch_name&gt;

              Create  a  "feature"  branch.  It's  morally equivalent to "git checkout <b>-b</b>" except it defaults to
              creating it based on some form of 'master' instead of your current branch. In order of  preference
              it will be upstream/master, origin/master, master, depending upon what remotes are available.

              Note  that you can specify "--feature-prefix" (or add "feature_prefix" to your config) to have all
              features created with a prefix. This is useful for branch-based  workflows  where  developers  are
              expected to create branches names that, for example, start with their username.

              forcepush, fpush

              The  same  as  "smartpush",  but  uses  "--force-with-lease".  This  is  a  "safer"  way  of doing
              force-pushes and is the recommended way to push after rebasing  or  amending.  Never  do  this  to
              shared branches. Very convenient for keeping the branch behind a pullrequest clean.

              lint

              Run any linters configured in .sugarjar.yaml.

              pullsuggestions, ps

              Pull  any  suggestions  *that  have been committed* in the GitHub UI.  This will show the diff and
              prompt for confirmation before merging. Note that a fast-forward merge will be used.

              smartclone, sclone

              A smart wrapper to "git clone" that handles forking and managing remotes for you.  It will clone a
              git repository using hub-style short name ("$org/$repo"). If the org of the repository is not  the
              same  as your github-user then it will fork the repo for you to your account (if not already done)
              and then setup your remotes so that "origin" is your fork and "upstream" is the upstream.

              smartlog, sl

              Inspired by Facebook's "sl" extension to Mercurial, this command will show you a tree of all  your
              local branches relative to your upstream.

              smartpullrequest, smartpr, spr

              A  smart  wrapper to "hub pull-request" that checks if your repo is dirty before creating the pull
              request.

              smartpush, spush

              A smart wrapper to "git push" that runs whatever is defined in  "on_push"  in  .sugarjar.yml,  and
              only pushes if they succeed.

              subfeature, sf &lt;feature&gt;

              An alias for 'sj feature &lt;feature&gt; &lt;current_branch&gt;'

              unit

              Run any unitests configured in .sugarjar.yaml.

              up [&lt;branch&gt;]

              Rebase the current branch (or specified branch) intelligently.  In most causes this will check for
              a  main (or master) branch on upstream, then origin. If a branch explicitly tracks something else,
              then that will be used, instead.

              upall

              Same as "up", but for all branches.

              version

              Print the version of sugarjar, and then run 'hub version' to show the hub and git versions.

       Be sure to checkout Sapling (https://sapling-scm.com/)! SugarJar was written as a stop-gap to get Sapling
       features before it was open-sourced, and as such Sapling may serve your needs even better.
