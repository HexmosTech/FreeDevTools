</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dcmsend - Simple DICOM storage SCU (sender)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       dcmsend [options] peer port dcmfile-in...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>dcmsend</b> application implements a Service Class User (SCU) for the Storage Service Class. In contrast
       to the well-known <b>storescu</b> utility, <b>dcmsend</b> has less options and is, therefore, easier to use - this also
       explains the term 'simple' in the title. The main purpose of this application is to send a whole bunch of
       DICOM files to a Storage Service Class Provider (SCP). <b>dcmsend</b> supports both multiple  associations  (one
       after the other) and decompression of DICOM SOP instances if needed to transfer them.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       peer        hostname of DICOM peer

       port        tcp/ip port number of peer

       dcmfile-in  DICOM file or directory to be transmitted

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Typical</b> <b>Usage</b>
       A  typical  use  case  of  <b>dcmsend</b> is to send arbitrary SOP instances that are stored as DICOM files to a
       storage SCP. The following command does exactly this:

       dcmsend --verbose &lt;peer&gt; &lt;port&gt; *.dcm

       If the DICOM files are stored in a hierarchy of directories below the directory 'IMAGES',  the  following
       command can be used:

       dcmsend -v &lt;peer&gt; &lt;port&gt; --scan-directories --recurse IMAGES

       It  is  also possible to specify multiple directories and to combine the aforementioned approaches (using
       both file and directory names):

       dcmsend -v +sd +r &lt;peer&gt; &lt;port&gt; IMAGES_1 IMAGES_2 test.img *.dcm

       If the SOP instances are referenced from a DICOMDIR file, option <u>--read-from-dicomdir</u>  (or  <u>+rd</u>)  can  be
       used to send all referenced DICOM files without loading them already for the association negotiation:

       dcmsend -v &lt;peer&gt; &lt;port&gt; --read-from-dicomdir DICOMDIR

       And again, all of the above approaches can be combined like this:

       dcmsend -v +sd +r +rd &lt;peer&gt; &lt;port&gt; IMAGES_1 IMAGES_2 test.img DICOMDIR *.dcm

       The  default option <u>--read-file-only</u> makes sure that only DICOM files (i.e. the ones with meta-header and
       magic word 'DICM' after the preamble) are processed. Usually, if processing a whole bunch of files, it is
       also a good idea not to halt on the first invalid input file or if an unsuccessful store was encountered.
       This can be accomplished by using option <u>--no-halt</u>. Please note, however, that 'unsuccessful store'  does
       not  mean  that  the  DIMSE  status of the C-STORE response indicates an error. It means that the C-STORE
       request could not be sent to the storage SCP.

       If more than 128 Presentation Contexts are needed, which is the maximum number allowed according  to  the
       DICOM  standard,  a  new association is started after the previous one has been completed. In cases where
       this behavior is unwanted, it can be disabled using option  <u>--single-association</u>.  In  addition,  whether
       only  lossless  compressed  data  sets  are decompressed (if needed), which is the default, or also lossy
       compressed data sets can be specified using the <u>--decompress-xxx</u> options.

       In order to get both an overview and detailed information on the transfer of  the  DICOM  SOP  instances,
       option  <u>--create-report-file</u>  can be used to create a corresponding text file. However, this file is only
       created as a final step if the application did not terminate before (with an error).

   <b>Scanning</b> <b>Directories</b>
       Adding directories as a parameter to the command line only makes sense if  option  <u>--scan-directories</u>  is
       also  given.  If  the  files  in the provided directories should be selected according to a specific name
       pattern (e.g. using wildcard matching), option <u>--scan-pattern</u> has to be used. Please note that this  file
       pattern  only  applies  to  the  files  within  the  scanned  directories, and, if any other patterns are
       specified on the command line outside the <u>--scan-pattern</u> option (e.g. in order to select further  files),
       these do not apply to the specified directories.

       Thus,  the  third  of the above examples will recurse over directories IMAGES_1 and IMAGES_2 and transmit
       files that are contained in these two folders and all their subfolders (due to option <u>+r</u>).  Additionally,
       <b>dcmsend</b> will transfer 'test.img' and all files with extension 'dcm' from the current working folder. Note
       that providing directory names without enabling option <u>+sd</u> does not make sense.

   <b>DICOM</b> <b>Conformance</b>
       Basically, the <b>dcmsend</b> application supports all Storage SOP Classes as an SCU, including private ones. By
       default, the application checks the SOP Class UID of the DICOM file in order to make sure that only valid
       SOP instances are sent. With option <u>--no-uid-checks</u> this check can be disabled.

       The  <b>dcmsend</b>  application  also  supports  all  Transfer Syntaxes that are defined in the DICOM standard.
       Private Transfer Syntaxes can only be used if the UID check  is  disabled  with  option  <u>--no-uid-checks</u>.
       Please  note,  however, that only a limited number of Transfer Syntaxes are supported for converting them
       to the DICOM Default Transfer Syntax  (Implicit  VR  Little  Endian).  With  option  <u>--list-decoders</u>  the
       Transfer  Syntaxes  supported  natively  or  by  decoders are listed. The output typically looks like the
       following:

       Transfer Syntaxes supported natively:
       - Little Endian Implicit
       - Little Endian Explicit
       - Big Endian Explicit

       Transfer Syntaxes supported by decoders:
       - Deflated Explicit VR Little Endian
       - JPEG Baseline
       - JPEG Extended, Process 2+4
       - JPEG Spectral Selection, Non-hierarchical, Process 6+8
       - JPEG Full Progression, Non-hierarchical, Process 10+12
       - JPEG Lossless, Non-hierarchical, Process 14
       - JPEG Lossless, Non-hierarchical, 1st Order Prediction
       - JPEG-LS Lossless
       - JPEG-LS Lossy (Near-lossless)
       - RLE Lossless

       Since <b>dcmsend</b> tries to be as simple as possible for the user, by default Presentation Contexts  might  be
       proposed  to  the  SCP  that  are  strictly  speaking  'illegal'. This is because, according to the DICOM
       standard, the SCU always has to propose the DICOM Default Transfer Syntax in at  least  one  Presentation
       Context associated with each abstract syntax (i.e. SOP class). This requirement is waived if the SCU only
       has  access  to  the SOP instance in lossy compressed form or if the decompressed pixel data would be too
       large to be encoded. With option  <u>--no-illegal-proposal</u>  the  strict  DICOM-conformant  behavior  can  be
       enforced,  i.e.  no  possibly  illegal  Presentation  Context  will be proposed but the corresponding SOP
       instance will be rejected (if needed). Please note, however, that the size of the decompressed pixel data
       is not checked.

       The default Transfer Syntax for 'Lossless JPEG Compression', 'Lossy JPEG Compression' and so on  are  not
       always  proposed as also required by the DICOM standard. The same limitation applies to other compression
       schemes. See DICOM PS 3.5 section 10 for details.

</pre><h4><b>LOGGING</b></h4><pre>
       The level of logging output of the various command line tools and underlying libraries can  be  specified
       by  the user. By default, only errors and warnings are written to the standard error stream. Using option
       <u>--verbose</u> also informational messages like processing details are reported. Option <u>--debug</u> can be used to
       get more details on the internal activity, e.g. for debugging  purposes.  Other  logging  levels  can  be
       selected  using  option  <u>--log-level</u>. In <u>--quiet</u> mode only fatal errors are reported. In such very severe
       error events, the application will usually terminate. For more details on the different  logging  levels,
       see documentation of module 'oflog'.

       In case the logging output should be written to file (optionally with logfile rotation), to syslog (Unix)
       or  the  event  log  (Windows)  option  <u>--log-config</u> can be used. This configuration file also allows for
       directing only certain messages to a particular output stream and for filtering certain messages based on
       the module or application where they  are  generated.  An  example  configuration  file  is  provided  in
       <u>&lt;etcdir&gt;/logger.cfg</u>.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b></h4><pre>
       All command line tools use the following notation for parameters: square brackets enclose optional values
       (0-1), three trailing dots indicate that multiple values are allowed (1-n), a combination of both means 0
       to n values.

       Command  line  options  are  distinguished  from  parameters  by a leading '+' or '-' sign, respectively.
       Usually, order and position of command line options  are  arbitrary  (i.e.  they  can  appear  anywhere).
       However,  if  options  are mutually exclusive the rightmost appearance is used. This behavior conforms to
       the standard evaluation rules of common Unix shells.

       In addition, one or more command files can be specified using an '@' sign as a  prefix  to  the  filename
       (e.g.  <u>@command.txt</u>).  Such  a command argument is replaced by the content of the corresponding text file
       (multiple whitespaces are treated as a single separator unless they appear between two  quotation  marks)
       prior  to  any  further  evaluation. Please note that a command file cannot contain another command file.
       This simple but effective approach allows one to summarize common combinations of options/parameters  and
       avoids longish and confusing command lines (an example is provided in file <u>&lt;datadir&gt;/dumppat.txt</u>).

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>dcmsend</b>  utility  uses the following exit codes when terminating. This enables the user to check for
       the reason why the application terminated.

   <b>general</b>
       EXITCODE_NO_ERROR                         0
       EXITCODE_COMMANDLINE_SYNTAX_ERROR         1

   <b>input</b> <b>file</b> <b>errors</b>
       EXITCODE_CANNOT_READ_INPUT_FILE          20 (*)
       EXITCODE_NO_INPUT_FILES                  21
       EXITCODE_INVALID_INPUT_FILE              22
       EXITCODE_NO_VALID_INPUT_FILES            23

   <b>output</b> <b>file</b> <b>errors</b>
       EXITCODE_CANNOT_WRITE_OUTPUT_FILE        40 (*)
       EXITCODE_CANNOT_WRITE_REPORT_FILE        43

   <b>network</b> <b>errors</b>
       EXITCODE_CANNOT_INITIALIZE_NETWORK       60
       EXITCODE_CANNOT_NEGOTIATE_ASSOCIATION    61
       EXITCODE_CANNOT_SEND_REQUEST             62
       EXITCODE_CANNOT_ADD_PRESENTATION_CONTEXT 65

       (*) Actually, these codes are currently  not  used  by  <b>dcmsend</b>  but  serve  as  a  placeholder  for  the
       corresponding group of exit codes.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>dcmsend</b> utility will attempt to load DICOM data dictionaries specified in the <u>DCMDICTPATH</u> environment
       variable.   By   default,   i.e.   if   the  <u>DCMDICTPATH</u>  environment  variable  is  not  set,  the  file
       <u>&lt;datadir&gt;/dicom.dic</u> will be loaded unless the dictionary is  built  into  the  application  (default  for
       Windows).

       The  default  behavior  should  be  preferred  and  the  <u>DCMDICTPATH</u>  environment variable only used when
       alternative data dictionaries are required. The <u>DCMDICTPATH</u> environment variable has the same  format  as
       the  Unix  shell  <u>PATH</u>  variable in that a colon (':') separates entries. On Windows systems, a semicolon
       (';') is used as a separator. The data dictionary code will attempt to load each file  specified  in  the
       <u>DCMDICTPATH</u> environment variable. It is an error if no data dictionary can be loaded.
