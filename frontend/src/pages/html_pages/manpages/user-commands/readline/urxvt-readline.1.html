       readline - improve readline editing

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A support package that tries to make editing with readline easier. At the moment, it reacts to clicking
       shift-left mouse button by trying to move the text cursor to this position. It does so by generating as
       many cursor-left or cursor-right keypresses as required (this only works for programs that correctly
       support wide characters).

       To avoid too many false positives, this is only done when:

       - the tty is in ICANON state.
       - the text cursor is visible.
       - the primary screen is currently being displayed.
       - the mouse is on the same (multi-row-) line as the text cursor.

       The  normal selection mechanism isn't disabled, so quick successive clicks might interfere with selection
       creation in harmless ways.
