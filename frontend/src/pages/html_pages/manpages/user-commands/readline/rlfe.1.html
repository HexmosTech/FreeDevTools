</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       rlfe - "cook" input lines for other programs using readline

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rlfe</b> [<u>-l</u> <u>filename</u>] [<u>-a</u>] [<u>-n</u> <u>appname</u>] [<u>-hv</u>] [<u>command</u> [<u>arguments</u> <u>...</u>]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rlfe</b>  lets  you  use  history  and line-editing in any text oriented tool. This is especially useful with
       third-party proprietary tools that cannot be distributed linked against readline. It is not  perfect  but
       it works pretty well.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -a     append to the logfile (default is to overwrite).

       -l filename
              log into file.

       -n appname
              set the readline application name.

       -h     print usage string.

       -v     print version information.

</pre><h4><b>PROBLEMS/TODO</b></h4><pre>
       When  running  mc  -c under the Linux console, mc does not recognize mouse clicks, which mc does when not
       running under fep.

       Pasting selected text containing  tabs  is  like  hitting  the  tab  character,  which  invokes  readline
       completion.  We don't want this.  I don't know if this is fixable without integrating fep into a terminal
       emulator.

       Echo  suppression  is a kludge, but can only be avoided with better kernel support: We need a tty mode to
       disable "real" echoing, while still  letting  the  inferior  think  its  tty  driver  to  doing  echoing.
       Stevens's book claims SCR$ and BSD4.3+ have TIOCREMOTE.

       The latest readline may have some hooks we can use to avoid having to back up the prompt.

       Desirable  readline  feature:   When in cooked no-echo mode (e.g. password), echo characters are they are
       types with '*', but remove them when done.

       A synchronous output while we're editing an input line should be inserted in  the  output  view.PPbefore*
       the input line, so that the lines being edited (with the prompt) float at the end of the input.

       A  "page  mode"  option to emulate more/less behavior:  At each page of output, pause for a user command.
       This required parsing the output to keep track of line lengths.  It also requires remembering the output,
       if we want an option to scroll back, which suggests that  this  should  be  integrated  with  a  terminal
       emulator like xterm.

                                                                                                         <u><a href="../man1/RLFE.1.html">RLFE</a></u>(1)
