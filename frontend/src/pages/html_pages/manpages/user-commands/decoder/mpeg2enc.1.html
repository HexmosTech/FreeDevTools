</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       mpeg2enc is heavily enhanced derivative of the MPEG Software Simulation Group's MPEG-2 reference encoder.
       It  accepts  streams in a simple planar YUV format "YUV4MPEG" produced by the <b>lav2yuv</b> and related filters
       (e.g. <b><a href="../man1/yuvscaler.1.html">yuvscaler</a></b>(1)) from the <b><a href="../man1/mjpegtools.1.html">mjpegtools</a></b>(1) package.  An output plug-in to the <b><a href="../man1/mpeg2dec.1.html">mpeg2dec</a></b>(1) MPEG decoder is
       available to permit its use in  transcoding  applications.  The  encoder  currently  fully  supports  the
       generation  of  elementary MPEG-1, progressive and interlaced frame MPEG-2 streams.  Field encoded MPEG-2
       is also possible but is not currently maintained or supported.

       For most purposes this elementary stream output will need to  be  multiplexed  with  one  or  more  audio
       streams into a program/systems stream using the <b><a href="../man1/mplex.1.html">mplex</a></b>(1) tool.

       Note  that  although  this  manual  page  aims  to explain how mpeg2enc can be used effectively it is not
       intended as an introduction to MPEG-1/2 video which is a fairly complex topic in its own right.  The MPEG
       video format is a somewhat baroque standard with many many options, not all of which necessarily easy  to
       explain or even particular useful in the context of a software encoder.

       Much  useful  practical information for novices can be found in the mjpeg-HOWTO document that should have
       been installed with <b><a href="../man1/mjpegtools.1.html">mjpegtools</a></b>(1) package.  Further information and useful  supporting  software  can  be
       found on the mjpegtools web-site:

              <b><a href="http://mjpeg.sourceforge.net">http://mjpeg.sourceforge.net</a></b>

</pre><h4><b>SELECTING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>MPEG</b> <b>PROFILE</b></h4><pre>
       Set  the  MPEG  profile  to  use.   The  MPEG  standards  support a vast number of options.  In practice,
       different applications of the MPEG format place additional constraints  of  the  form  the  MPEG  stream.
       Setting this flag selects the kind of stream to produce.

       <b>-f|--format</b> 0
               -       Generic MPEG1.

               A basic MPEG-1 profile that lets most parameters
               be adjusted for particular applications using the other flags.
               Typical applications would be to produce a variable bitrate MPEG-1
               stream with big buffers and a high data-rate software playback
               on a computer.

       <b>-f|--format</b> 1
               -       Standard VCD.

       An  MPEG1 profile exactly to the VCD2.0 specification.  Flag settings that would result in a non-standard
       stream structure are simply ignored.

       <b>-f|--format</b> 2
               -       User VCD.

       As for profile 2 but bitrate and video buffer size can be set to non-standard values. Frame size may also
       be non-standard.  Bit-rate and buffer sizes default to those for standard VCD.

       <b>-f|--format</b> 3
               -       Generic MPEG2.

       A basic MPEG-2 profile that lets most parameters be adjusted for particular applications using the  other
       flags.   Typical  applications  would  be  to produce a MPEG-2 stream with big buffers and long GOP's for
       software playback on a computer.

       <b>-f|--format</b> 4
               -       Standard SVCD.

       An MPEG-2 profile exactly to the SVCD2.0 specification. Flag settings that would result in a non-standard
       stream structure are simply ignored.

       <b>-f|--format</b> 5
               -       Non-standard SVCD.

       As for profile 4 but bitrate, video buffer size, GOP sizes and  structure  can  be  set  to  non-standard
       values.  Frame  size  may  also be non-standard.  Bit-rate and buffer sizes default to those for standard
       SVCD.

       <b>-f|--format</b> 6
               -       VCD Stills sequence.

       Encodes the special style of MPEG stream used for still images on VCDs.  To use this profile you must set
       the target size you wish to compress the images to using the -T flag.   Reasonable values are around 35KB
       for standard resolution stills (352 wide) and 120KB for high resolution stills (704 wide).

       <b>-f|--format</b> 7
               -       SVCD Stills sequence.

       Encodes the special style of MPEG stream used for still images on SVCDs.  Both standard  (480  wide)  and
       high  resolution  (704  wide) images are supported. As with VCD stills you select how big each compressed
       still should be using the -T flag.

       <b>-f|--format</b> 8
               -       DVD MPEG-2 for 'dvdauthor'

       This version adds special dummy navigation packets into the output stream that the dvdauthor  tool  fills
       in  to  make  a  proper  .VOB  for authoring.  Bit-rate defaults to 7500kbps, buffer sizes to the maximum
       permitted by the DVD specification.

       <b>-f|--format</b> 9
               -       DVD MPEG-2.

       Just a very basic implementation. Useful with DXR2 board and similar hardware that can decode MPEG-2 only
       if it is presented in a DVD like form.  Bit-rate defaults  to  7500kbps,  buffer  sizes  to  the  maximum
       permitted by the DVD specification.

       <b>-f|--format</b> 10
               -       ATSC 480i

       <b>-f|--format</b> 11
               -       ATSC 480p

       <b>-f|--format</b> 12
               -       ATSC 720p

       <b>-f|--format</b> 13
               -       ATSC 1080i

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>FUNCTION</b> <b>LETTERS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-v|--verbose</b> num

       Set verbosity level to num.  0 = warnings and errors only, 1 = information as well, 2=really verbose.

       <b>-K|--custom-quant-matriceskvcd|tmpgenc|</b>
        <b>default</b> | <b>hi-res</b> | <b>file=</b>inputfile | <b>help</b>

       Specify  which  quantisation matrices to use instead of the defaults (which can be specified by using "-K
       default").   Using "-K hi-res" is identical to using the -H option. The  value  kvcd  uses  the  Kvcd.Net
       matrices   from   <a href="http://www.kvcd.net/">http://www.kvcd.net/</a>;   the   value   tmpgenc   invokes   the   TMPGEnc  matrices  from
       <a href="http://www.tmpgenc.net/e_main.html">http://www.tmpgenc.net/e_main.html</a>. On average (this depends on the source material), the tmpgenc  tables
       reduce  the average bitrate by about 10% and the kvcd tables reduce bitrate by about 16% (compared to the
       default tables).

       <b>-E|--unit-coeff-elim</b> -40..40

       Specify when a special 'unit coefficient elimination' algorithm should be applied to the encoded  picture
       blocks.   Basically,  this  procedure  forces  blocks of a type that don't carry much information but are
       expensive to encode to be simply skipped.  The larger  the  number  the  more  potentially  visible  this
       skipping  is  likely  to  be  but  the  more  compression  is  boosted.   A negative value means that all
       coefficients are zeroed, positive means only texture but not  base  intensity  coefficients  are  zeroed.
       Values  of  around 10 or -10 seem to work well with high quality source material. For noisier material it
       might be worth trying 20 or -20.

       <b>-R|--b-per-refframe</b> 0..2

       Specify how many bi-directionally (B type) difference-encoded frames should be encoded between  reference
       (I  or  P)  frames.   The  default is 0 except for VCD encoding where it is 2 B frames as required by the
       standard.  Experts differ on how much using B frames improves compression. In practice  unless  you  have
       really  clean  material  they  tend  to  be  fairly  useless  and  sometimes  even  harmful.  Encoding is
       significantly faster and uses less memory if no B frames are encoded and compression is rarely more  than
       marginally worse.

       <b>-?|--help</b>

       Display a synopsis of the command syntax.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTION</b> <b>LETTERS</b> <b>ADJUSTING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>SELECTED</b> <b>PROFILE</b></h4><pre>
       N.b. If the profile you have selected sets particular values for these parameters it will over-ride these
       adjustment  flags.   In particular, there is almost <u>nothing</u> that can be adjusted for the standard VCD and
       SVCD profiles.

       <b>-b|--video-bitrate</b> num

       The bitrate of the output video stream in kBits/sec.  The default is exactly the bitrate required for VCD
       streams.  If variable bitrate (VBR) mode has been selected (see  the  -q  option)  this  is  the  <u>maximum</u>
       bitrate  of  the  stream.  <b>NOTE:</b>  By  default MPEG-2 streams (<b>-f</b> 3, 4, 5, 8 and 9 are VBR.  Use the <b>--cbr</b>
       option for generating CBR (Constant Bit Rate) streams.

       <b>-A|--ratecontroller</b> 0..1

       Specify which of the rate control algorithms to use.   Default is 0.

       <b>-V|--video-buffer</b> num

       The maximum video buffer usage required to decode the stream in KBytes.  The default is 46KB  the  (tiny)
       size  specified  for  VCD.  The size to use for SVCD is the (more reasonable) 230KB.  If you are encoding
       for a half-decent software decoder it makes sense to push this up to 500K or more.

       <b>-T|--target-still-size</b> num

       Set the target size for (S)VCD still images in KB.

       <b>-s|--sequence-header-every-gop</b>

       This flag forces the encoder to generate a "sequence header" at the  start  of  every  group-of-pictures.
       This  is  needed  by some player hardware to support fast forward/rewind/random access functions but is a
       waste of bits otherwise.

       <b>-d|--no-dummy-svcd-SOF</b>

       The SVCD MPEG-2 profile demands that special "Scan OFfset" which are (in effect) pointers to the place on
       the final SVCD disk where the video for 0.5 and around 5-10 seconds behind and ahead  in  the  stream  is
       located.    The   intended  use  of  this  information  is  to  support"Fast  forward/Rewind"  functions.
       Unfortunately, at the time mpeg2enc encodes the video it doesn't know where the video is going to finally
       end up.  So special dummy "Scan OFfset" values are written which are intended to be filled in during  the
       creation  of  the  SVCD  image.  Currently  the  GNU  vcdimager tool handles this task.  However, in some
       circumstances the dummy offsets can cause problems.   This flags stops mpeg2enc generating them.

       <b>--correct-svcd-hds</b>

       In the official SVCD standards the field in the MPEG-2 header information that  passes  on  the  encoders
       "recommended"  horizontal  resolution to decode the stream to is supposed to take the values 540 (for 4:3
       sequences) or 720 (for 16:9 sequences).  In practice many players don't work unless  the  value  is  480.
       This  flag, forces mpeg2enc to follow the official standard. It is worth trying if 16:9 sequences play at
       4:3 aspect ratio.

       <b>--no-constraints</b>

       This flag deactivates all constraints for the maximum video samplerate or video resolution.  Its  purpose
       is  to  allow  the  encoding  of  unusual resolutions of MPEG-video (e.g. 2200 x 576, 160 degrees FOV VR-
       theatre MPEG movies), but should be used with care: It can possible circumvent a number of other security
       checks, and untested settings can cause mpeg2enc to crash in this mode.  <b>-l</b>|--level h|high|m|main

       This flag allows the MPEG-2 implementation level against which the coding parameters are  checked  to  be
       set.  You may need to set this to 'high' if you're encoding HDTV material.

       <b>--no-altscan-mpeg2</b>

       This  flag  deactivates  the use of the 'alternate' macroblock scan pattern for MPEG2 encoding.  Normally
       this pattern is used but a few elderly software decoders had bugs relating to this feature.   You  should
       never need to use this flag.

       <b>--dualprime-mpeg2</b>

       MPEG-2  supports a special motion estimation mode (DPME, Dual Prime Motion Estimation) for I/P-frame only
       streams that can somewhat improve compression.  A number of players (both hardware and software)  do  not
       support  this  mode.  Those players  may or may not be MPEG-2 compliant depending if DPME is an option or
       not in the MPEG-2 specs.  If you need to generate content for  such players (e.g.  Ogle  or  Apple's  DVD
       player  application)  you should NOT turn on dualprime-mpeg2!  Surprisingly at least one hardware/set-top
       player is known to be allergic to DPME being used.

       <b>-z|--playback-field-order</b> b|t

       This flag overrides the field-order specified in the interlacing tag of the input stream header. (If  you
       need  this  option,  it indicates a problem in the capturing/encoding process where the temporal order of
       the two fields in each frame has been mislabeled. The effect of this is weird  "juddering"  when  playing
       back the stream on a TV. Check the mjpeg-howto for more information about interlacing problems.)

</pre><h4><b>OPTION</b> <b>LETTERS</b> <b>CONTROLLING</b> <b>VIDEO</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-n|--video-norm</b> n|p|s

       Force  the  input  stream  to  be  treated  as  NTSC|PAL|SECAM regardless of what the stream header might
       suggest.  Basically this just sets the defaults for a bunch of other options.

       <b>-F|--frame-rate</b> num

       Set the frame-rate of the output-stream. By default, this  value  is  inferred  from  the  input  header.
       Currently  only  the  standard MPEG rates are supported.  Eventually more-or-less arbitrary rates will be
       possible.
        0 - illegal
        1 - 24000.0/1001.0 (NTSC 3:2 pulldown converted FILM)
        2 - 24.0 (NATIVE FILM)
        3 - 25.0 (PAL/SECAM VIDEO / converted FILM)
        4 - 30000.0/1001.0 (NTSC VIDEO)
        5 - 30.0
        6 - 50.0 (PAL FIELD RATE)
        7 - 60000.0/1001.0 (NTSC FIELD RATE)
        8 - 60.0

       <b>-a|--aspect</b> num

       Set the playback aspect ratio code of the encoded video. By default, this  value  is  inferred  from  the
       input header.
        1 - 1  - 1:1 display
        2 - 2  - 4:3 display
        3 - 3  - 16:9 display
        4 - 4  - 2.21:1 display

              For  MPEG-2  the  specified aspect ratios are used directly. For MPEG-1 mpeg2enc infers the MPEG-1
              pixel aspect code from the video norm specified and the specified playback aspect ratio.

       <b>-x|--display-hsize</b> num

       <b>-y|--display-vsize</b> num

       These set the display-horizontal-size and display-vertical-size hints in the MPEG-2.   By  default  these
       are  simply  the encode frame dimensions.  However, if they are set to different values the player gets a
       hint that the appropriate 'black bars' or cropping/scaling should be performed. The main  use  for  these
       parameters  is  to set a display-vertical-size of 1080 for HDTV 1080i or 1080p material.  Here, since the
       frame height has to be a multiple of 16, the encoded frame height is forced to be 1088, even though  HDTV
       standards specify only 1080 lines of picture content.  Standards committees ... love' em.

       <b>-p|--3-2-pulldown</b>

       Setting  -p  only  makes sense for 24frame/sec Movie source material.  It sets flags in the output stream
       that tell the decoder to play the movie as NTSC 60field/sec video using "3:2 pulldown".  This  is  vastly
       more efficient than encoding as 60field/sec video.  The classic application is to transcode a PAL-encoded
       movie (24fps played too fast at 25 fps!)  into NTSC (see the -f flag).

</pre><h4><b>OPTION</b> <b>LETTERS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>CONTROLLING</b> <b>COMPRESSION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SPEED</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-M|--multi-thread</b> num_CPU

       MPEG  encoding  is a task that can be split over a small number of CPU's quite efficiently.  Mpeg2enc can
       be internally set to split major processing tasks between a number of  concurrent  threads.    This  flag
       adjusts the multi-threading to the optimum to utilise the specified number of CPU's.

       It  should  be  noted  that  even with 1 CPU present <u>some</u> multi-threading is performed: frame input takes
       place in parallel with encoding.  The default -M value is 1.  This allows good performance to be achieved
       when when a seperate machine is being used for pre-processing (decoding from  MJPEG,  scaling,  denoising
       etc) with the final result pipe to mpeg2enc (e.g. using rsh or ssh).

       Setting  -M  0 disables all multithreading.  This is sometimes useful for debugging or to achieve maximum
       CPU efficiency on a shared machine. Setting -M 3 on a  dual-CPU  machine  will  produce  slightly  faster
       results  than -M 2 at the price of slightly less CPU efficiency.  This is useful if nothing else needs to
       be done on the encoding machine.  In practice there is little point setting -M greater than 4 even if the
       CPU's are available due to the fairly coarse-grained parallelism used.  Indeed there is a hardcoded limit
       of 4 worker threads.

       The default has been changed to be 0 instead of 1 to avoid the crash at end of encoding:

       INFO: [mpeg2enc] Signaling last frame = 499
       mpeg2enc: seqencoder.cc:433: void SeqEncoder::EncodeStream(): Assertion `pass1coded.size() == 0' failed.
       Abort

       <b>-q|--quantisation</b> 1<b>..</b>31

       Minimum quantisation of the  output  stream.   Quantisation  controls  the  precision  with  which  image
       information  is  encoded.  The lower the number the higher the quality but the greater the required data-
       rate.  <b>NOTE:</b> on IA32 systems it is possible to cause artifacting by setting the value too low (3 or less)
       due to arithmetic overflow/truncation in the DCT/iDCT routines.  If this option is set a <u>variable</u> <u>bitrate</u>
       stream is produced.  This is more efficient but variable bitrate MPEG-1 cannot be played by some hardware
       decoders and is rejected by some DVD authoring packages.  If you intend to use a software  decoder  you'd
       be insane not to use variable bitrate.

       If  this  option  is  set  without  a  maximum  bitrate being specified then quantisation is fixed at the
       specified value.  It should be noted that not specifying a bitrate is probably an error and  may  produce
       unexpected results.

       For  MPEG-2  streams  a  default  of  8 is used if <b>-q</b> is not explicitly given.  To force constant bitrate
       streams use <b>--cbr</b> and <b>-b</b> <b>NOT</b> <b>-q</b>!

       <b>-I|--interlace-mode</b> 0|1|2

       Set the sequence picture structure and block encoding type for MPEG-2 streams.  By default, this value is
       inferred from the interlacing tag of the input stream. Setting 0 encodes frame-by-frame with support  for
       interlaced  video turned off, and specifies that progressive chroma subsampling has been used.  Setting 1
       encodes frame-by-frame with interlace-adapted motion compensation and block encoding, and specifies  that
       interlaced  chroma subsampling has been used. Setting 2 encodes interlaced material field-by-field, which
       will produce more accurate results for highly textured interlaced material with lots of  motion,  at  the
       expense of generally less efficiency.

              This  setting should match the interlaced-ness of the input stream, otherwise chroma artifacts may
              be generated when the MPEG stream is played back.

       <b>-g|--min-gop-size</b> num

       <b>-G|--max-gop-size</b> num

       These flags set the minimum and maximum group-of-picture (GOP) size for  the  output  MPEG  stream.   The
       default values depend on the output format.

       For MPEG-1 (for example VCD) the default is a fixed GOP size of 12 (-g and -G are both set to 12).

       For  MPEG-2  the default value of -G (max) is set according to the video system: -G 15 for 625 line (PAL)
       and 18 for 525 line (NTSC).  If -g (min) has not been specified then the minimum GOP size is  set  to  be
       one half of the maximum (-G).

       To force a fixed GOP size specify both -g and -G with the same value.

       If  the  minimum  and maximum GOP sizes are <b>not</b> identical then mpeg2enc will start a <b>new</b> GOP if more than
       60% of the macroblocks in a P or B frame are Intra encoded.  This ensure big changes  of  image  coincide
       with a fully-encoded I-frame by starting  a new GOP.  This can help prevent transient "blockiness".

       Reasonable  minimum  GOP sizes are 6 or 9.  If a minimum is not specified but a maximum is given then the
       minimum will be set to one half the maximum.  A larger GOP size can help reduce the bitrate required  for
       a  given  quality.   However,  this really only applies to <b>high-quality</b> source material with <b>little</b> <b>noise</b>
       (e.g. digital video).  For broadcast material there is little point setting GOP size much  beyond  21  or
       24.  Even with good source material diminishing returns set in quite rapidly.  Also it must be noted that
       specific MPEG-2 formats (such as for DVD) are constrained in the maximum allowable GOP size.

       Note:  mpeg2enc  is currently hard-wired to produce 2 B frames between each I/P frame unless the GOP size
       forces less.  This is reasonable for medium to high bitrates (&gt;= 1Mbps) but probably sub-optimal for low-
       bitrate encoding.

       <b>-c|--closed-GOPs</b>

       Setting this flag causes the encoder to generate only "closed" GOPs (Groups  of  Pictures)  that  can  be
       decoded  without reference to their predecessor.  This is useful for streams that are supposed to be used
       in multi-angle DVD's and applications where more easily edittable MPEG is required.

       <b>-P|--force-b-b-p</b>

       This flag forces the GOP size selection to choose sizes that ensure 2 B frames  appear  between  adjacent
       I/P  frames.   Several  common  MPEG-1  decoders  can't  handle streams where less than 2 B-frames appear
       between I/P frames.

       <b>-Q|--quantisation-reduction</b> -4.0..5.0

       This flag sets the amount quantisation is reduced for blocks containing  large  amounts  of  sharp  image
       detail.   Large  values  produces efficient use of bits but may cause visible artifacting around detailed
       sections.  With noisy source material this option may cause a "swimming" effect on  textured  backgrounds
       as  the  noise  cause the quantisation of blocks to be boosted at random.  The default is 0.0 (off).  See
       also the -X option.

       <b>-X|--quant-reduction-max-var</b> 0.0..2500.0

       Luma variance below which quantisation boost (-Q) is activated.

       <b>-r|--motion-search-radius</b> num

       This flag sets the motion estimation search radius.  For most purposes the default (16)  should  be  just
       fine.   For  high-resolution  MPEG-2 and active scenes it may be worth bumping it up.  However, this will
       make encoding significantly slower.  There is little point reducing the radius.  Speed gains are not huge
       and the impact on quality can be marked.

       <b>-4|--reduction-4x4</b> 1..4

       <b>-2|--reduction-2x2</b> 1..4

       These options control how radical the encoder is in throwing away  apparently  poor  candidate  estimates
       during  motion estimation.  A setting of 1 means very few blocks are discarded early which makes for slow
       encoding but quality as good as it gets. A setting of 4 makes for fast encoding but can  impact  quality.
       The  -4  flag  controls  discarding during the initial 4*4 sub-sampled search stage, the -2 flag controls
       discarding during the secondary 2*2 sub-sampled stage.

              These flags are useful as the speed quality trade-off is markedly different depending on which CPU
              you have.  On modern machines the impact on speed is around a factor 2 on older machines a  factor
              3.   The  impact  on  quality  is  around  10% quantisation (0.2 of a bit of precision in encoding
              textures).  For most purposes the default settings will be fine.  However on P-III Katmai etc -4 2
              -2 1 gives a good near-optimum quality setting with reasonably speed.

       <b>-N|--reduce-hf</b> num

       Setting this flag adjusts the way texture detail is quantised to reduce the precision with which of high-
       frequency information encoded. This is very useful for <u>mildly</u> noisy sources.  If you  have  really  noisy
       material the filtering tools available in mjpegtools are a much better bet.  The specified number must be
       in the range 0.0 to 2.0 gives the maxium quantisation boost.  A useful number to use would be 1.5 or 1.0.

       <b>-H|--keep-hf</b>

       Setting  this  flag  makes the encoder encode as much high-frequency information as possible.   This is a
       good setting for maximising quality at VCD resolution with good quality low-noise  source  material.   It
       can also help with "swimmy" material if you can spare the bitrate!

       <b>-D|</b>--intra_dc_prec <b>num</b>

       Specifies  the  precision  of  the  DC  component. The default is 9. Most commercial DVDs use 10. Using 9
       instead saves a few bits. Using 10 might help to avoid looking larger areas  of  nearly  the  same  color
       blocky.   A value of 11 is only valid at the next MPEG-2 profile/level so it's not a currently meaningful
       value to use.

</pre><h4><b>OPTION</b> <b>LETTERS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>CHUNKING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>STREAM</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-S|--sequence-length</b> num

       This flag allows the target size of individual sequences in the final multiplexed stream  to  be  set  in
       MBytes.  If  set  mpeg2enc keeps track of how large the eventual stream is getting and inserts a sequence
       split (actually: sequence end / sequence start) into the output stream each time it reaches the specified
       limit.  The multiplexer <b><a href="../man1/mplex.1.html">mplex</a></b>(1) can recognise these splits and start a new multiplexed output file  each
       time it encounters one.   In this way it is easy to automatically ensure each component sequence file can
       be  burnt onto a CD-R and still be played as a stand-alone MPEG sequence.   For the SVCD and VCD profiles
       the default target sequence length is 700M bytes. For other profiles the default is that sequence  length
       is unlimited.

       <b>-B|--nonvideo-bitrate</b> num

       Since  mpeg2enc  can't  read minds it cannot know in advance what other material will be multiplexed with
       the output video stream.  Thus to get its calculations of where to insert split point right it  needs  to
       be told the combined data-rate of the other material that is eventually to be multiplexed with the video.
       This flag allows this rate to be specified in K bits/sec.

       A  good  rule  of  thumb  is  to  use  the  total rate of all the other streams plus 1% of the total rate
       including video.

       <b>-u|--cbr</b>

       Force the use of Constant Bit Rate encoding.  Less than optimal (and inefficient in almost all cases) but
       some folks insist on it. <b>NOTE:</b> this <b>disables</b> (overrides) the use of the <b>-q</b> option!

       It is an error to use this option and not specify a bitrate using <b>-b</b> since a constant bitrate of 0  makes
       no sense.

       <b>--chapters</b> frame,...

       This  flag  allows  you  to  define  chapter  points  within  the  mpeg stream.  This is most useful when
       generating DVD video.  Each chapter point is specified by frame number, with the first frame being number
       0.  Every chapter point defined will end up at the beginning of a closed GOP as an I frame.

</pre><h4><b>SSE,</b> <b>3D-Now!,</b> <b>MMX</b> <b>!</b></h4><pre>
       mpeg2enc makes extensive use of these SIMD instruction set extension on x86 family CPU's.   The  routines
       used are determined dynamically at run-time.  It should be noted that using SSE requires operating system
       support.  Old 2.2.x Linux kernels (unless patched ones like RedHat) do not have this and so SSE, although
       physically present, won't be activated.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       There  should  be  an option to force GOP sizes that permit 2 B frames between I/P frames.  Some decoders
       (even software)  can't handle the case where I/P frames come back to back or with only 1 B frame  between
       them.

       There needs to be a facility for writing dummy user-data fields so that the multiplexer/imager can insert
       forward/backward pointers when muxing/imaging an SVCD.
