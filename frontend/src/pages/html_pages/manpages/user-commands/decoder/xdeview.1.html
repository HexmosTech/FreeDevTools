</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xdeview - a powerful decoder for binary files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xdeview</b> <b>[Xt</b> <b>options]</b> <b>[--</b> <b>options]</b> <b>[</b><u>file(s)</u><b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>XDeview</u>  is a smart decoder for attachments that you have received in encoded form via electronic mail or
       from the usenet. It  is  similar  to  the  standard  <b><a href="../man1/uudecode.1.html">uudecode</a></b>(1)  command,  yet  with  more  comfort  and
       flexibility.   <u>XDeview</u>  supports  the  <u>uuencoding,</u> <u>xxencoding,</u> <u>Base64</u> and <u>BinHex</u> encoding methods, and is
       able to handle split-files (which have been sent in multiple parts) as well as multiple  files  at  once,
       thus  greatly  simplifying  the  decoding  process.  Usually, you will not have to manually edit files to
       prepare them for decoding.

       If you don't really need a graphical frontend for these kinds of jobs, have a  look  at  <b><a href="../man1/uudeview.1.html">uudeview</a></b>(1)  and
       <b><a href="../man1/uuenview.1.html">uuenview</a></b>(1).

       After  invoking  the  program,  it  will  scan  all the given files for encoded data. If any of them were
       directories, they will be recursively dived into.  You don't need to give files on the command line;  you
       can  also  select  files  later  from  within the program. After completing the initial scan, you will be
       presented with a list of files that seem like they can be decoded  properly.  You  can  then  pick  files
       individually for decoding.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There's  no  real  need to set options on the command line; they can also be set from within the program.
       Note that options must be preceded by a double-hyphen '--', otherwise they might be mistaken for  display
       options.

       <b>-d</b>     Sets  the  program into desperate mode. It will then offer you to decode incomplete files. This is
              useful if you are missing the last part of a 50-parts posting, but in most cases the  desperately-
              decoded  files will simply be corrupt and unusable. The degree of usefulness of an incomplete file
              depends on the file type.

       <b>-f</b>     Uses fast mode for file scanning. The program assumes that each input file holds at most one part,
              which is usually true for files in a news spool directory. This option <b>breaks</b>  <b>decoding</b>  of  input
              files with multiple articles. Also, certain sanity checks are disabled, probably causing erroneous
              files  to be presented for decoding.  Sometimes you'll get error messages when decoding, sometimes
              you'll just receive invalid files. Don't use <b>-f</b> if you can't live with these problems.

       <b>-o</b>     Gives the OK to overwrite files already there on decoding. The  default  is  to  prompt  the  user
              whether to overwrite, rename or skip the file.

       <b>-v</b>     Disables  verbosity.  Normally,  the  program  prints some status messages while reading the input
              files, which can be very helpful if something should go wrong. Use if these messages disturb you.

       <b>-p</b> <b>path</b>
              Sets the path where decoded files shall be written to. This must be a valid  pathname,  or  you'll
              get errors when trying to decode anything. Defaults to the current working directory.

       <b>-b</b>     This changes <u>xdeview's</u> policy of finding a part number on a subject line and may only be needed in
              some  rare  cases  when  part  numbers  are found in () parentheses as well as in [] brackets, for
              example in a series of multi-part postings.  By default, <u>xdeview</u> uses  the  numbers  found  in  ()
              parentheses  first.  But  if  this  number  indicates the file's number in the series and the part
              number is given in [] brackets, use this parameters to make the  program  read  the  other  number
              first.  This  does not affect decoding of files with only one or neither type of brackets.  If you
              prefer, you can also use the option as <b>-b[]</b>

       <b>-s</b>     Read "minus smartness". This option turns off automatic part number  detection  from  the  subject
              line.  Try  this  option  if <u>xdeview</u> fails to parse the subject line correctly and makes errors at
              guessing part numbers, resulting in incorrect ordering of the parts. With this option,  parts  are
              always  put  together  sequentially  (so  the  parts must be correctly ordered in the input file).
              <b>Note:</b> The correct part number found in proper <u>MIME</u> files is still evaluated.

       <b>-t</b>     Use plaintext messages. Usually, XDeview only presents encoded data for decoding. With this option
              set, text parts from <u>MIME</u> messages and non-encoded messages are also offered.  Plaintext  messages
              frequently  don't have an associated filename, so they're assigned a unique name from a sequential
              four-digit number.

</pre><h4><b>MAIN</b> <b>MENU</b></h4><pre>
       The main window of <u>xdeview</u> is composed of six main elements. At the top is the <u>Menu</u> <u>Bar.</u>  Centered is the
       <u>File</u> <u>List,</u> which lists all the files that have been detected in  the  encoded  data  and  are  ready  for
       decoding.  Left  of  the  File List is the <u>Status</u> <u>List,</u> which describes the status of each file. Usually,
       this list will show "OK" for all files, as display of erroneous files is  normally  suppressed.   On  the
       right  is  a bunch of short-cut buttons with the most heavily-used functions. At the bottom of the window
       is the <u>Save</u> <u>Path</u> entry field, and the status bar. Each of these items will be described  individually  in
       the following text.

</pre><h4><b>MENU</b> <b>BAR</b></h4><pre>
       <b>File</b> <b>Menu</b>

              <b>Load</b> <b>...</b>
                     Loads  encoded  files. These files are then scanned for encoded data and files; these files
                     are added to the File List. You can also select directories,  which  are  then  recursively
                     descended into

              <b>Encode</b> Encode  file(s),  storing the encoded data on disk, sending them via email, or posting them
                     to newsgroups. See below.

              <b>Helpers</b>
                     Xdeview reads information from your .mailcap and .mime.types  to  perform  the  appropriate
                     default  action  when you hit the "Execute" button. In this dialogue, you can configure the
                     locations of these files.

              <b>Save</b> <b>Setup</b>
                     Saves all current options, the input and output file paths etc. into the .xdeviewrc file in
                     your home directory. This file is automatically read upon startup, so  the  saved  settings
                     will be set by default in future sessions. The resource file is actually a Tcl script which
                     you can edit with any editor.

              <b>Quit</b>   Exits the program.

       <b>Options</b>
              Set  various  options  that modify the behaviour of the program. Note that most options only catch
              for files read afterwards.

              <b>Fast</b> <b>Scanning</b>
                     Sets fast scanning mode. The program will then assume that all input files contain at  most
                     one  encoded part (as it is true with files from a news spool). The scanning engine will be
                     sped up because it does not have to read each input  file  completely  but  stops  scanning
                     after encoded data has been found.

              The  decoder  has  to  disable some safety options in fast mode, so certain problems with the file
              will only be detected when finally decoding the file.

              <b>Automatic</b> <b>Overwrite</b>
                     When decoding a file which is already present in the target directory,  the  user  will  be
                     asked  whether the file shall be overwritten. By enabling this option, target files will be
                     overwritten without asking.

              <b>Desperate</b> <b>Mode</b>
                     Usually, you will only be presented files to which all  parts  have  been  found.  Enabling
                     Desperate  Mode,  you'll  also  get  to  see  the  other files as well, with an appropriate
                     description of the problem in the Status List.  In desperate mode, the  decoder  will  also
                     try  to  detect  short  Base64  files  outside of MIME messages. This is normally disabled,
                     because these desperate tries to find Base64 encoding may  cause  misdetection  of  encoded
                     data, again resulting in invalid files.

              <b>Verbose</b> <b>Mode</b>
                     Opens  a  separate text box to which additional messages will be written while scanning the
                     input files. These messages are extremely helpful for finding out what went wrong if  files
                     cannot be decoded properly.

              <b>Alternate</b> <b>Bracket</b> <b>Policy</b>
                     Changes the heuristics by which the decoder tries to extract a part number from the subject
                     line.  The  algorithm  usually  gives  numbers in braces () higher priority than numbers in
                     brackets []. If both kinds of brackets are present,  and  their  use  is  conflicting  (for
                     example  if  both  the  part  number  and  a series number are given), then you may have to
                     explicitly select the bracket policy. If this option is false  (default),  then  the  "part
                     number" is taken from the braces (), otherwise from the brackets [].

              <b>Dumb</b> <b>Mode</b>
                     Disables automatic part number detection by parsing the subject line.  Use if <u>xdeview</u> fails
                     to  pick  up  the  correct  part  numbers. Note that with the option set, the parts must be
                     correctly ordered in the input files. Also, missing parts will not be detected this way.

              <b>Handle</b> <b>Text</b> <b>Files</b>
                     Usually, XDeview only presents encoded data for decoding. With this option set, text  parts
                     from <u>MIME</u> messages and non-encoded messages are also offered. Plaintext messages frequently
                     don't  have  an  associated  filename,  so they're assigned a unique name from a sequential
                     four-digit number.

              <b>Auto</b> <b>Info</b>
                     Opens up the information window whenever you click on a file in the File List.

              <b>Remove</b> <b>Input</b> <b>Files</b>
                     With this option set, input files are removed if any file  was  successfully  decoded  from
                     them.  Use  with care! UUDeview only checks if any data was decoded from an input file, but
                     does not care about any other contents of that input file, or whether a file also  held  an
                     incomplete attachment.

              <b>MIME</b> <b>Compliance</b>
                     Be more strict when reading MIME input files.

       <b>Actions</b>

              <b>Decode</b> Decode the selected file(s).

              <b>Rename</b> Rename  the selected file(s), for example if the filename conflicts with existing files, or
                     if the name doesn't meet system limitations.

              <b>Decode</b> <b>All</b>
                     Decode all files currently visible in the File List.

              <b>Info</b>   Displays available info on the currently selected file (if more than one file is  selected,
                     only  info  for  the  first  will  be  displayed).   This is the zeroeth part of a file, if
                     available, or the header of the first part up to the beginning of encoded data.

              <b>Execute</b>
                     Runs an external program with the currently selected file. A program is selected  by  first
                     looking  at  the  <u>Content-Type</u>  of  the  message, if available, then by checking the file's
                     extension.  The appropriate information is read from your <b>.mailcap</b>  and  <b>.mime.types</b>  files
                     (although  the  handling  of  information in .mailcap files is currently incomplete). If no
                     matching type is found, a dialog box pops up where you can enter any command.

              <b>List</b> <b>Text</b> <b>File</b>
                     This is for the rare cases when a text file has been sent through the net in encoded  form.
                     Use  this  action only when you know the file in question is in fact a text file, otherwise
                     you'll get a load of trash on the screen.

       <b>Help</b>

              <b>About</b>  A short message from the Author.

              <b>License</b>
                     Displays the license under which xdeview is distributed, the <b>GPL.</b>  Read it, or you'll  hear
                     from my lawyers.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>LIST</b></h4><pre>
       The  File List is a list box displaying all the files that have been picked up while scanning the encoded
       data. These files are ready for decoding, previewing or anything. The list  can  be  scrolled  using  the
       scrollbar on the right of the list.

       Individual  files  can  be selected simply by clicking on them. Multiple files can be selected by holding
       down the <u>CTRL</u> key and clicking on the individual files.

</pre><h4><b>STATUS</b> <b>LIST</b></h4><pre>
       The Status Lists notes the corresponding status for each file in the <u>File</u> <u>List,</u> Usually, you'll just  see
       "OK" here; otherwise, an error message is shown describing why the file cannot be decoded properly. There
       are the following states:

       <b>OK</b>     All  parts  of  the file have been found, and the encoded data looks correct on first sight. There
              are certain problems that might only appear when decoding the  file,  but  usually  everything  is
              fine.

       <b>Incomplete</b>
              This  file  is missing one or more parts. If you decode this file, the output data will be corrupt
              and usually unusable.

       <b>No</b> <b>Begin</b>
              The file doesn't have a beginning. The decoded file will be most certainly corrupt and unusable.

       <b>No</b> <b>End</b> No end was found on the file. This usually means that one or more parts at the  end  are  missing.
              The degree of usefulness of a decoded file depends on the file type.

       <b>Error</b>  A previous attempt to decode the file has failed.

</pre><h4><b>SHORT-CUT</b> <b>BUTTONS</b></h4><pre>
       The buttons on the right side of the window are short-cuts for the menu items. Read the discussion of the
       Main Menu items above for an explanation.

</pre><h4><b>SAVE</b> <b>PATH</b></h4><pre>
       This is the path where decoded files will be written to.

</pre><h4><b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       A short message what the program is currently doing or what it expects you to do.

</pre><h4><b>ENCODING</b> <b>MENU</b></h4><pre>
       When  encoding  files ("Encode" from the "File" menu), a large dialog box opens where you can set various
       options for the file. If you selected multiple files for encoding, a status line at the top displays  the
       number of files left. The dialog itself stays open until all files have been handled.

       <b>Filename</b>
              The current file to encode. You cannot edit this field.

       <b>Send</b> <b>As</b>
              The  file  name by which the file will be sent. Defaults to the filename stripped of all directory
              information.

       <b>Use</b> <b>Subject</b>
              When mailing or posting, this text will be used as subject. The  filename  and  part  numbers  are
              added automatically, so you can choose to leave this line empty.

       <b>Lines</b> <b>per</b> <b>File</b>
              Sets  the number of encoded lines per part. Bigger files will be automatically split into multiple
              parts. Use if you are posting files to a newsgroup, or if the  recipient's  system  cannot  handle
              large files. A good splitting size is 1000 lines. "0" lines means not to split.

       <b>...</b> <b>Encoding</b>
              Selects  the  encoding method to use. If you wonder which one's the best, you might find a clue in
              my article "Introduction to Decoding".

       <b>File</b> <b>In</b> <b>(Path)</b>
              Sets a directory where to encode the file to. The encoding will go to files  with  the  same  base
              name as the original file, but with extensions of .001, .002 (depending on the number of necessary
              parts as enforced by the "Lines per File" setting).

       <b>Email</b> <b>To</b>
              Give  a comma-separated list of email addresses. This option might be disabled if your system does
              not allow sending of emails.

       <b>Post</b> <b>To</b>
              Here you can enter a comma-separated list of newsgroups to which the file should be  posted.  This
              option might be disabled if your system does not support posting news.

       <b>NNTP</b> <b>Server</b>
              This  field  only  appears  on  some systems, in the case that a news host is needed, but none was
              configured at compile-time. If this field does appear, you must enter a valid host  name  here  in
              order for posting to work. If you don't want to post the file anyway, don't worry about it.

       <b>OK</b>     Performs the selected action(s) on this file and skips to the next one.

       <b>OK</b> <b>to</b> <b>All</b>
              Uses  these  settings  for  each  file in question (does not prompt you for the other files), thus
              sending all files at once.

       <b>Next</b>   Does not encode the file and skips to the next one (sorry, there's no button to skip backwards).

       <b>Cancel</b> Cancels encoding and returns to the main menu.

</pre><h4><b>SETUP</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       If it exists, the file <u>.xdeviewrc</u> in your home directory will be executed in the Tcl  interpreter  during
       program  initialization.  It  must  be  a  valid Tcl program, which you can use to set certain options by
       default. For the Tcl-illaterate: variables can be set using the following syntax:
       <b>set</b> <b>var_name</b> <b>value</b>
       The following variables (options) can be set (look at the text above for an explanation of  what  they're
       doing)

       <b>OptionFast</b>
              If set to 1, use fast scanning mode.

       <b>OptionBracket</b>
              If set to 1, use the alternate bracket policy.

       <b>OptionOverwrite</b>
              If set to 1, assume it's Ok to overwrite files without asking.

       <b>OptionDesperate</b>
              If set to 1, switch into desperate mode.

       <b>OptionVerbose</b>
              If set to 1, print progress messages.

       <b>SaveFilePath</b>
              This is a string variable with the default Save Path, where you want decoded files to go.

       <b>EncodeMaxLines</b>
              Maximum number of lines per file for encoding. "0" for unlimited.

       <b>EncodeEncoding</b>
              Default encoding to use. "0" for UUencoding, "1" for XXencoding and "2" for Base64 encoding.

       <b>NNTPServer</b>
              The  address  of  your NNTP server (only needed on some systems). Can also be set (preferredly) in
              your environment variable <u>NNTPSERVER.</u>

</pre><h4><b>RUNTIME</b> <b>MESSGAGES</b></h4><pre>
       If you have enabled verbose mode, progress messages will appear in an  own  text  window  titled  <u>Runtime</u>
       <u>Messages.</u>   The  messages  generated  during the scanning phase are extremely helpful in tracing what the
       program does, and can be used to figure out the reason why files cannot be  decoded,  if  you  understand
       them. This section explains how to interpret them. Understanding this section is not necessary to operate
       the program.

       First,  there  are "Loading" messages, which begin with the string "Loaded". Each line should feature the
       following items:

       <b>Source</b> <b>File</b>
              The first item is the source file from which a part was loaded. Many parts can be detected  within
              a single file.

       <b>Subject</b> <b>Line</b>
              The complete subject is reproduced in single quotes.

       <b>Identifier</b>
              The  program  derives  a unique identification for this thread from the subject line, for grouping
              articles that look like they belong to the same file. The result of this algorithm is presented in
              braces.

       <b>Filename</b>
              If a filename was detected on the subject line or within the data (for example, on a  begin  line,
              or as part of the Content-Type information).

       <b>Part</b> <b>Number</b>
              The  part  number  derived  from  the  subject  line,  or,  in the case of properly MIME-formatted
              messages, from the "part" information.

       <b>Begin/End</b>
              If a "begin" or "end" token was detected, it is printed here.

       <b>Encoding</b> <b>Type</b>
              If encoded data was detected within this part, either "UUdata", "Base64", "XXdata" or "Binhex"  is
              printed here.

       More  messages  are printed after scanning has completed. A single line will be printed for each group of
       articles. The contents of this line are best understood by looking at an example. Here is one:

       <b>Found</b> <b>'mailfile.gz'</b> <b>State</b> <b>16</b> <b>UUData</b> <b>Parts</b> <b>begin</b> <b>1</b> <b>2</b> <b>3</b> <b>4</b> <b>5</b> <b>end</b> <b>6</b> <b>OK</b>

       This indicates that the file <u>mailfile.gz</u> has been found. The file was uuencoded ("UUData")  and  consists
       of  6  parts.  The  "begin" token was found in the first part, and the "end" token was found in the sixth
       part. Because it looks like everything's there, this file is tagged as being "OK". The <u>State</u> is a set  of
       bits, where the following values may be or'ed:

       <b>1</b>      Missing Part

       <b>2</b>      No Begin

       <b>4</b>      No End

       <b>8</b>      No encoded data found.

       <b>16</b>     File looks Ok

       <b>32</b>     An error occurred during decoding of the file.

       <b>64</b>     File was successfully decoded.

       If  you  cannot execute <u>xdeview,</u> and it reports something like "command not found", but are sure that the
       file itself can be found, check the reference to the main file <u>uuwish</u> at the top of the file.
