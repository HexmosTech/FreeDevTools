       kyua db-migrate — Upgrades the schema of an existing results file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>kyua</b> <b>db-migrate</b> [<b>--results-file</b> <u>file</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>kyua</b> <b>db-migrate</b> command migrates the schema of an existing database to the latest version implemented
       in <u><a href="../man1/kyua.1.html">kyua</a></u>(1).

       This  operation  is  not  reversible.  However, a backup of the database is created in the same directory
       where the database lives.

       The following subcommand options are recognized:

       <b>--results-file</b> <u>path</u>, <b>-s</b> <u>path</u>
           Specifies the results file to operate on.  Defaults to ‘LATEST’,  which  causes  <b>kyua</b>  <b>db-migrate</b>  to
           automatically load the latest results file from the current test suite.

           The following values are accepted:

           ‘LATEST’
               Requests  the  load of the latest results file available for the test suite rooted at the current
               directory.

           Directory
               Requests the load of the latest results file available for the test suite  rooted  at  the  given
               directory.

           Test suite name
               Requests the load of the latest results file available for the given test suite.

           Results identifier
               Requests the load of a specific results file.

           Explicit file name (aka everything else)
               Load the specified results file.

           See “Results files” for more details.

   <b>Results</b> <b>files</b>
       Results  files  contain,  as their name implies, the results of the execution of a test suite.  Each test
       suite executed by <u><a href="../man1/kyua-test.1.html">kyua-test</a></u>(1) generates a new results file, and such results files can be  loaded  later
       on by inspection commands such as <u><a href="../man1/kyua-report.1.html">kyua-report</a></u>(1) to analyze their contents.

       Results  files  support identifier-based lookups and also path name lookups.  The differences between the
       two are described below.

       The default naming scheme for the results files provides simple support for identifier-based lookups  and
       historical  recording of test suite runs.  Each results file is given an identifier derived from the test
       suite that generated it and the time the test suite was run.  Kyua can later look  up  results  files  by
       these fields.

       The identifier follows this pattern:

             &lt;test_suite&gt;.&lt;YYYYMMDD&gt;-&lt;HHMMSS&gt;-&lt;uuuuuu&gt;

       where  ‘test_suite’  is  the path to the root of the test suite that was run with all slashes replaced by
       underscores and ‘YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-uuuuuu’ is a timestamp with microsecond resolution.

       When using the default naming scheme, results files are stored in  the  <u><a href="file:~/.kyua/store/">~/.kyua/store/</a></u>  subdirectory  and
       each file holds a name of the form:

             <a href="file:~/.kyua/store/results.">~/.kyua/store/results.</a>&lt;identifier&gt;.db

       Results    files    are    simple    SQLite    databases    with    the    schema    described   in   the
       <u>/usr/share/kyua/store/schema_v?.sql</u> files.  For details on  the  schema,  please  refer  to  the  heavily
       commented SQL file.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>kyua</b> <b>db-migrate</b> command returns 0 on success or 1 if the migration fails.

       Additional exit codes may be returned as described in <u><a href="../man1/kyua.1.html">kyua</a></u>(1).
