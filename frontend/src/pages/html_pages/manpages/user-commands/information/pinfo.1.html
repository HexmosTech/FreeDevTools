</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pinfo</b> - is user-friendly, console-based viewer for Info documents

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pinfo</b> [<u>options</u>] [<b>infopage</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  is  a  program  for  viewing  info  files. You specify which page you want to read by passing it an
       <u>infopage</u> argument. This argument contains the name of an info page (i.e. 'bash').  The program will  then
       (by  default)  search  for it in <u><a href="file:/usr/share/info">/usr/share/info</a></u>, <u>/usr/info</u>, <u>/usr/local/share/info</u>, <u>/usr/local/info</u>.  and
       <u>/opt/info</u>.  The search path can be adjusted by INFOPATH environment  variable  or  in  the  configuration
       file. Pinfo will also automatically add the suffix '-info', '-info.Z', '-info.gz', or '-info.bz2'.

       When  the search for info pages fails, man is called with the infopage argument, and its output is parsed
       by pinfo. This means that when you don't have the appropriate info page, but have a man page instead; the
       man page will be viewed.

       When no <u>infopage</u> is specified, the default `dir' page is shown.

       Supported options are

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b> - print help information and exit.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--version</b> - print version information and exit.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--manual</b> - uses manual page instead of info by default. (pinfo -m could be used as a  manual  pager).
       <b>Warning</b>:  Everything  what follows this option is passed to the `<u>man</u>' program. Don't be confused if pinfo
       options, which followed `<b>-m</b>' don't work. When using this option, pinfo does not parse the info options as
       usual! It invokes the man part of program.

       You can also call the man function of pinfo in another way. When pinfo is called  with  an  argv[0]  (the
       program  file  name),  which  contains  the  word  'man'  in  its  name,  the  man  functions are enabled
       automatically.

       Previously there was a symlink to pinfo, called pman, but I had to remove it from the distribution, since
       its name was in conflict with some other utility. Anyway, you can feel free to create such a link if  you
       wish.

       <b>-r</b>,  <b>--raw-filename</b>  -  uses  a  raw  filename  first  (i.e.  the name which you specified as <u>infopage</u> is
       considered to be a real file in the specified location).

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--file</b> synonym for -r.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--apropos</b> - if this is set, apropos is called when no man or info page could be found.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--cut-man-headers</b> - if this is set, man parsing code will try to cut out the  repeated  man  headers.
       Use with care. ;)

       <b>-s</b>,  <b>--squeeze-lines</b>-  cut  empty  lines  from  manual  pages.  This option enables auto cutting of every
       repeated newline in a manual page.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--force-manual-tag-table</b>- forces manual detection of tag table. This allows you to view  info  pages,
       which  may  be  corrupted. (as i.e. version of jed's pages, shipped with RH5.0). The tag table corruption
       usually appears in that the info links, which you follow, move you to quite unexpected nodes.

       <b>--node=</b><u>nodename</u>, <b>--node</b> <u>nodename</u>- Go to the node `<u>nodename</u>' of info file. Since 0.6.7 it is also possible
       to specify nodes as in standalone info via file names, like `(gcc)Introduction'.

       <b>--rcfile=</b><u>filename</u>, <b>--rcfile</b> <u>filename</u>- Use alternate configuration file.

       <b>--long-manual-links</b>, <b>-l</b>- Use long link names in manuals. On some systems the manual hierarchy is  divided
       into  subsections like `3ncurses', etc, while on other systems all belongs to section `3'. If this option
       is what your system is like, feel free to use it.

       <b>--clear-at-exit</b>, <b>-x</b>- Clear screen at exit.

       The options are handled by GNU getopt, so you can here (as in other programs) abbreviate the option names
       to the minimal number of characters by which the options differ.

       Warning! If you do not have getopt, these options will not work!

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>KEYS</b> <b>WHEN</b> <b>BROWSING</b> <b>INFO</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       Just take a look at the example configuration file (below), and at the key descriptions.  Keys  available
       in manual viewer differ a bit from the keys available in info viewer.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       There  is a variable $INFOPATH, which can specify the paths to be searched for info files. It's format is
       similar to that of the $PATH variable. An example setting could look like:

       <b>/usr/info:/usr/somewhere/info:/not/even/in/usr/info</b>

       etc. Directories are separated by colons.

</pre><h4><b>COLOR</b> <b>AND</b> <b>KEY</b> <b>DEFINITIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  configuration  files  called  <a href="file:~/.pinforc">~/.pinforc</a>  and  [prefix]/etc/pinforc,  for  local  and  global
       configuration (where prefix is the prefix of the directory, where pinfo is installed, i.e. <a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a>, or
       /).  Here's an example of such a file; we'll discuss the contents below:

       # Here are some color setting.
       # Whitespace between the entries is optional.
       COL_NORMAL = COLOR_WHITE, COLOR_BLACK, NO_BOLD, NO_BLINK
       COL_MENUSELECTED = COLOR_RED, COLOR_BLACK, BOLD, NO_BLINK
       COL_MENU=COLOR_BLUE,COLOR_BLACK,BOLD, NO_BLINK

       As  you  can  see, the format is simple. First I'll explain the color definitions. First you must enter a
       color name (all available color names are present in the example, and they're self explanatory, I  think.
       There  is  also  a  special  color  COLOR_DEFAULT,  which  stands  for  transparency). Then you enter the
       foreground color, and the background color. The BOLD attribute means that we want the foreground color to
       be highlighted. (i.e.   light  blue,  light  green).  BLINK  attribute  is  the  blinking  attribute,  or
       highlighted background in some other configurations.

       Now  let's  move  to the key definitions. Here we first put a key name (again all keys are present in the
       example); then we enter its value -- either surrounded by apostrophes,  or  a  keycode  number  (like  in
       KEY_REFRESH_1), or its mnemonic code name if its a special key (like i.e. in KEY_FOLLOWLINK_1).

       If  you wish to specify key by code value, use the supplied program 'testkey' to obtain the needed value.
       It mainly is a feature, when you want to add some CTRL+letter keybindings, and similar.

       For each function you can bind two keys, i.e.  you  could  bind  both  Enter  and  Cursor  Right  to  the
       FollowLink-function.   As  you  can  see in the example above, the two key names are KEY_FOLLOWLINK_1 and
       KEY_FOLLOWLINK_2.

       Here's an explanation of the key names:

       The special mnemonics for keys (which are defined at present) are:

              <b>KEY_BREAK</b>

              <b>KEY_DOWN</b>

              <b>KEY_UP</b>

              <b>KEY_LEFT</b>

              <b>KEY_RIGHT</b>

              <b>KEY_DOWN</b>

              <b>KEY_HOME</b>

              <b>KEY_BACKSPACE</b>

              <b>KEY_NPAGE</b>

              <b>KEY_PPAGE</b>

              <b>KEY_END</b> [Note: this works probably <b>ONLY</b> with Linux ncurses]

              <b>KEY_F(x)</b>

              <b>KEY_CTRL('c')</b>
                        - this assigns the key value to a <u>ctrl+c</u> combination. <u>c</u> may be any letter you wish.

              <b>KEY_ALT('c')</b>
                        -  this  assigns  the key value to a <u>alt+c</u> combination. <u>c</u> may be any letter you wish. If
                        <u>alt</u> key won't work, you may use <u>ESC+key</u> combination.

              <b>'c'</b>       - this means a printable character <u>c</u>. The syntax is just like in C/C++ ;).

              <b>[number]</b>  - you can also specify key as its code number. It is useful e.g. when specifying control
                        keys, and some nonstandard keys.  A numerical value of zero turns given key binding off.

       See manual page for curs_getch (3x) for description of their meaning.

       Warning! Try not to create some serious key binding conflicts!

       The options in the last part of the example configuration file should be  fairly  self-explanatory.   The
       variables that can be set to true or false do the same things as the command line arguments with the same
       names.

              <b>MANUAL</b>    If  this  is  set  to  <b>true</b>  the  default is to first check for a man page, instead of a
                        texinfo file.

              <b>CUT-MAN-HEADERS</b>
                        If set to true, then pinfo tries to cut off the repeated headers throughout man pages.

              <b>CUT-EMPTY-MAN-LINES</b>
                        If set to true, then pinfo tries to cut off the repeated newlines (i.e. it will  shorten
                        each set of consecutive newlines to one newline).

              <b>RAW-FILENAME</b>
                        If  set  to  true,  the  file  argument is taken to be the name of a file in the current
                        working directory, i.e. the directories in <b>INFOPATH</b> will only be searched if a file with
                        this name is not in the working directory.

              <b>APROPOS</b>   If set to true, <b>apropos</b> is called if no info or man page is found.

              <b>DONT-HANDLE-WITHOUT-TAG-TABLE</b>
                        If set to <b>true</b> , pinfo will not attempt to display texinfo pages without tag tables.

              <b>HTTPVIEWER</b>
                        Set this to the program you want to use to follow http links in documents.

              <b>FTPVIEWER</b> Set this to the program you want to use to follow ftp links in documents.

              <b>MAILEDITOR</b>
                        Set this to your favorite email program, and it will be started if you follow  an  email
                        link in a document.

              <b>PRINTUTILITY</b>
                        Utility,  which you use for printing. I.e. `lpr'. If you don't use any, you may also try
                        something like `cat &gt;/dev/lp1', or sth. ;)

              <b>MANLINKS</b>  This specifies the section names, which may  be  referenced  in  your  man  pages  (i.e.
                        Xtoolkit  man  pages  match the section 3Xt (see for example XtVaCreateWidget) manpage),
                        Xlib function pages match section 3X11, etc. Such extensions may not  be  recognized  by
                        default, so it is a good idea to add them).

              <b>INFOPATH</b>  This  allows you to override the default search path for info pages. The paths should be
                        separated by colons.

              <b>MAN-OPTIONS</b>
                        This specifies the options, which should be passed to the `man'  program.   (see  <a href="../man1/man.1.html">man</a>(1)
                        for description of what they're like).

              <b>STDERR-REDIRECTION</b>
                        Pinfo  allows  you  to redirect the stderr output of called programs. For example if you
                        don't want to see man's error messages about manual page formatting, you can use  <u>STDER-</u>
                        <u>REDIRECTION="2&gt;</u> <u>/dev/null".</u> <u>This</u> <u>is</u> <u>the</u> <u>default.</u>

              <b>LONG-MANUAL-LINKS</b>
                        This  is  another  true/false  option,  which  decides whether your system supports long
                        manual section names, or not. (i.e. "3ncurses" instead of "3").

              <b>FILTER-0xB7</b>
                        This decides, whether you want to convert 0xb7 chars to `o', or  not.  For  example  for
                        iso-8859-2  fonts this makes man's list marks a bit nicer ;) (look for example at perl's
                        man page, to see how those marks look like).

              <b>QUIT-CONFIRMATION</b>
                        This decides whether you want to use quit confirmation on exit, or not.

              <b>QUIT-CONFIRM-DEFAULT</b>
                        This yes/no option determines  the  default  answer  to  the  QUIT-CONFIRMATION  dialog.
                        (default answer is when you press a key, that does not match the asked question).

              <b>CLEAR-SCREEN-AT-EXIT</b>
                        This  true/false  option  determines if you want to have your screen cleared at exit, or
                        no.

              <b>CALL-READLINE-HISTORY</b>
                        This true/false option determines if you want to have a prompt  of  last  history  entry
                        whenever calling readline wrapper, eg. in subsequent searches.

              <b>HIGHLIGHTREGEXP</b>
                        This  is  an  option,  through  which  you  may  pass  to pinfo regexps, which should be
                        highlighted when working with document. Warning! This may turn very slow if you  use  it
                        without care!

              <b>SAFE-USER</b> This  option is used to pass the name of user, to which suid when pinfo is run with root
                        privileges.

              <b>SAFE-GROUP</b>
                        This option is used to pass the name of group, to which suid when pinfo is run with root
                        privileges.

</pre><h4><b>INTERNATIONALIZATION</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       Pinfo implements general features of gnu gettext library (the thing,  which  you  need  to  see  national
       messages  ;).  But  it  is not the end. Pinfo allows you to use national info pages! You only need to put
       them to your info directory, into a subdirectory, which is called `$LANG'.
