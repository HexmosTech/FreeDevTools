</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>canid</b> - the caching additional network information daemon

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>canid</b> [-file <u>cachefile</u>] [-expiry <u>sec</u>] [-concurrency <u>n</u>] [-port <u>port</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Canid provides a simple web service for caching and simplifying information retrieved from other services
       (see  <u>BACKENDS</u>)  about  Internet  hostnames and IP addresses. It is designed for use when looking up many
       addresses and/

       On launch, Canid begins serving on the specified port. It  shuts  down  cleanly  on  SIGINT  (^C  on  the
       console).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       •   <b>-file</b> <u>cachefile</u> (default: no backing store) Use the given JSON file as a backing store for the cache.
           Loads the cache from this file on startup, and saves it on termination.

       •   <b>-expiry</b> <u>sec</u> (default: 86400, 1 day) Expire cache entries after <u>sec</u> seconds.

       •   <b>-concurrency</b> <u>n</u> (default: 16) Allow at most <u>n</u> simultaneous pending requests per backend.

       •   <b>-port</b> <u>port</u> (default: 8043) TCP port to listen on

</pre><h4><b>RESOURCES</b></h4><pre>
       Canid provides three resources via HTTP:

       •   <b>/</b>

           The root resource is an HTML page providing a simple web front-end to the service.

       •   <b>/prefix.json?addr=</b>

           Look up information about the prefix associated with an address, and return it as a JSON object. This
           object presently contains a <b>Prefix</b> key with the routed prefix associated with the address, an <b>ASN</b> key
           with  a  BGP  autonomous  system number associated with the address, and a <b>CountryCode</b> key for an ISO
           3166 country code associated with the address.

       •   <b>/address.json?name=</b>

           Look up an Internet hostname via DNS, and return the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses associated with it as  a
           JSON object. This object contains a <b>Name</b> key with the name looked up, and an <b>Addresses</b> key containing
           an array of IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses as strings. Looking up an address for a name will cause prefix
           information for all addresses found to be cached, as well.

       All  JSON resources also contain a <b>Cached</b> key, the time at which the data entry was put into the cache in
       [RFC3339][https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/RFC3339] format.

</pre><h4><b>BACKENDS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>prefix.json</b> resource currently uses the  Prefix  Overview  and  Geolocation  API  entry  points  from
       [RIPEstat][https://stat.ripe.net].

       The  <b>address.json</b>  resource  uses DNS, as provided by the Go standard library´s <b>net.LookupIP()</b> (i.e., the
       system resolver)
