       zipinfo - list detailed information about a ZIP archive

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>zipinfo</b> [<b>-12smlvhMtTz</b>] <u>file</u>[<u>.zip</u>] [<u>file(s)</u> ...] [<b>-x</b> <u>xfile(s)</u> ...]

       <b>unzip</b> <b>-Z</b> [<b>-12smlvhMtTz</b>] <u>file</u>[<u>.zip</u>] [<u>file(s)</u> ...] [<b>-x</b> <u>xfile(s)</u> ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>zipinfo</u>  lists technical information about files in a ZIP archive, most commonly found on MS-DOS systems.
       Such information includes file access permissions, encryption status, type of  compression,  version  and
       operating  system  or  file  system  of compressing program, and the like.  The default behavior (with no
       options) is to list single-line entries for each file in the  archive,  with  header  and  trailer  lines
       providing  summary  information for the entire archive.  The format is a cross between Unix ``ls -l'' and
       ``unzip -v'' output.  See <b>DETAILED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b> below.  Note that <u>zipinfo</u> is the  same  program  as  <u>unzip</u>
       (under  Unix,  a  link to it); on some systems, however, <u>zipinfo</u> support may have been omitted when <u>unzip</u>
       was compiled.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>file</u>[<u>.zip</u>]
              Path of the ZIP archive(s).  If the file specification  is  a  wildcard,  each  matching  file  is
              processed  in an order determined by the operating system (or file system).  Only the filename can
              be a wildcard; the path  itself  cannot.   Wildcard  expressions  are  similar  to  Unix  <u><a href="../man1/egrep.1.html">egrep</a></u>(1)
              (regular) expressions and may contain:

              *      matches a sequence of 0 or more characters

              ?      matches exactly 1 character

              [...]  matches any single character found inside the brackets; ranges are specified by a beginning
                     character,  a  hyphen, and an ending character.  If an exclamation point or a caret (`!' or
                     `^') follows the left bracket,  then  the  range  of  characters  within  the  brackets  is
                     complemented  (that  is, anything <u>except</u> the characters inside the brackets is considered a
                     match).  To specify a verbatim left bracket, the three-character sequence ``[[]'' has to be
                     used.

              (Be sure to quote any character that might otherwise be interpreted or modified by  the  operating
              system,  particularly  under Unix and VMS.)  If no matches are found, the specification is assumed
              to be a literal filename; and if that also fails, the suffix .zip is appended.   Note  that  self-
              extracting  ZIP  files  are supported, as with any other ZIP archive; just specify the .exe suffix
              (if any) explicitly.

       [<u>file(s)</u>]
              An optional list of archive members to be processed, separated by spaces.  (VMS versions  compiled
              with  VMSCLI defined must delimit files with commas instead.)  Regular expressions (wildcards) may
              be used to match multiple members; see above.  Again, be sure  to  quote  expressions  that  would
              otherwise be expanded or modified by the operating system.

       [<b>-x</b> <u>xfile(s)</u>]
              An optional list of archive members to be excluded from processing.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-1</b>     list filenames only, one per line.  This option excludes all others; headers, trailers and zipfile
              comments are never printed.  It is intended for use in Unix shell scripts.

       <b>-2</b>     list  filenames  only,  one  per  line, but allow headers (<b>-h</b>), trailers (<b>-t</b>) and zipfile comments
              (<b>-z</b>), as well.  This option may be useful in cases where the  stored  filenames  are  particularly
              long.

       <b>-s</b>     list zipfile info in short Unix ``ls -l'' format.  This is the default behavior; see below.

       <b>-m</b>     list  zipfile  info  in medium Unix ``ls -l'' format.  Identical to the <b>-s</b> output, except that the
              compression factor, expressed as a percentage, is also listed.

       <b>-l</b>     list zipfile info in long Unix ``ls -l'' format.  As with <b>-m</b> except that the compressed  size  (in
              bytes) is printed instead of the compression ratio.

       <b>-v</b>     list zipfile information in verbose, multi-page format.

       <b>-h</b>     list header line.  The archive name, actual size (in bytes) and total number of files is printed.

       <b>-M</b>     pipe  all  output  through an internal pager similar to the Unix <u><a href="../man1/more.1.html">more</a></u>(1) command.  At the end of a
              screenful of output, <u>zipinfo</u> pauses with a ``--More--'' prompt; the next screenful may  be  viewed
              by  pressing  the  Enter (Return) key or the space bar.  <u>zipinfo</u> can be terminated by pressing the
              ``q'' key and, on some systems, the Enter/Return key.  Unlike Unix <u><a href="../man1/more.1.html">more</a></u>(1), there is  no  forward-
              searching  or  editing capability.  Also, <u>zipinfo</u> doesn't notice if long lines wrap at the edge of
              the screen, effectively resulting in the printing of two or more lines  and  the  likelihood  that
              some  text  will scroll off the top of the screen before being viewed.  On some systems the number
              of available lines on the screen is not detected, in which case <u>zipinfo</u> assumes the height  is  24
              lines.

       <b>-t</b>     list totals for files listed or for all files.  The number of files listed, their uncompressed and
              compressed  total  sizes , and their overall compression factor is printed; or, if only the totals
              line is being printed, the values for the entire archive are given.   The  compressed  total  size
              does  not  include  the  12  additional  header bytes of each encrypted entry. Note that the total
              compressed (data) size will never match the actual zipfile size, since the latter includes all  of
              the internal zipfile headers in addition to the compressed data.

       <b>-T</b>     print  the  file  dates  and times in a sortable decimal format (yymmdd.hhmmss).  The default date
              format is a more standard, human-readable version  with  abbreviated  month  names  (see  examples
              below).

       <b>-U</b>     [UNICODE_SUPPORT  only]  modify or disable UTF-8 handling.  When UNICODE_SUPPORT is available, the
              option <b>-U</b> forces  <u>unzip</u>  to  escape  all  non-ASCII  characters  from  UTF-8  coded  filenames  as
              ``#Uxxxx''.   This  option  is  mainly  provided  for  debugging purpose when the fairly new UTF-8
              support is suspected to mangle up extracted filenames.

              The option <b>-UU</b> allows to entirely  disable  the  recognition  of  UTF-8  encoded  filenames.   The
              handling of filename codings within <u>unzip</u> falls back to the behaviour of previous versions.

       <b>-z</b>     include the archive comment (if any) in the listing.

       <b>-I</b> <u>CHARSET</u>
              [UNIX only] Specify a character encoding for UNIX and other archives.

       <b>-O</b> <u>CHARSET</u>
              [UNIX only] Specify a character encoding for DOS, Windows and OS/2 archives.

</pre><h4><b>DETAILED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>zipinfo</u>  has  a number of modes, and its behavior can be rather difficult to fathom if one isn't familiar
       with Unix <u><a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</a></u>(1) (or even if one is).  The default behavior is to list files in the following format:

  -rw-rws---  1.9 unx    2802 t- defX 11-Aug-91 13:48 perms.2660

       The last three fields are the modification date and time of the file, and its  name.   The  case  of  the
       filename  is  respected;  thus files that come from MS-DOS PKZIP are always capitalized.  If the file was
       zipped with a stored directory name, that is also displayed as part of the filename.

       The second and third fields indicate that the file was zipped under Unix with version 1.9 of <u>zip</u>.   Since
       it  comes  from  Unix, the file permissions at the beginning of the line are printed in Unix format.  The
       uncompressed file-size (2802 in this example) is the fourth field.

       The fifth field consists of two characters, either of which  may  take  on  several  values.   The  first
       character  may  be  either  `t'  or  `b',  indicating  that  <u>zip</u>  believes the file to be text or binary,
       respectively; but if the file is encrypted, <u>zipinfo</u> notes this fact by capitalizing the character (`T' or
       `B').  The second character may also take on four values, depending on whether there is an extended local
       header and/or an ``extra field'' associated with the file (fully explained in PKWare's  APPNOTE.TXT,  but
       basically  analogous  to  pragmas  in  ANSI  C--i.e., they provide a standard way to include non-standard
       information in the archive).  If neither exists, the character will be a hyphen (`-');  if  there  is  an
       extended  local  header  but  no extra field, `l'; if the reverse, `x'; and if both exist, `X'.  Thus the
       file in this example is (probably) a text file, is not encrypted, and has neither an extra field  nor  an
       extended  local  header associated with it.  The example below, on the other hand, is an encrypted binary
       file with an extra field:

  RWD,R,R     0.9 vms     168 Bx shrk  9-Aug-91 19:15 perms.0644

       Extra fields are used for various purposes (see discussion of the <b>-v</b> option below) including the  storage
       of  VMS  file attributes, which is presumably the case here.  Note that the file attributes are listed in
       VMS format.  Some other possibilities for the host operating system (which is actually  a  misnomer--host
       file system is more correct) include OS/2 or NT with High Performance File System (HPFS), MS-DOS, OS/2 or
       NT with File Allocation Table (FAT) file system, and Macintosh.  These are denoted as follows:

  -rw-a--     1.0 hpf    5358 Tl i4:3  4-Dec-91 11:33 longfilename.hpfs
  -r--ahs     1.1 fat    4096 b- i4:2 14-Jul-91 12:58 EA DATA. SF
  --w-------  1.0 mac   17357 bx i8:2  4-May-92 04:02 unzip.macr

       File  attributes  in  the  first two cases are indicated in a Unix-like format, where the seven subfields
       indicate whether the file:  (1) is a directory, (2) is readable (always true), (3) is  writable,  (4)  is
       executable  (guessed  on the basis of the extension--<u>.exe</u>, <u>.com</u>, <u>.bat</u>, <u>.cmd</u> and <u>.btm</u> files are assumed to
       be so), (5) has its archive bit set, (6) is  hidden,  and  (7)  is  a  system  file.   Interpretation  of
       Macintosh  file  attributes  is unreliable because some Macintosh archivers don't store any attributes in
       the archive.

       Finally, the sixth field indicates the compression method and possible sub-method used.   There  are  six
       methods  known  at  present:  storing (no compression), reducing, shrinking, imploding, tokenizing (never
       publicly released), and deflating.  In addition, there are four levels of reducing (1  through  4);  four
       types  of  imploding  (4K  or  8K  sliding dictionary, and 2 or 3 Shannon-Fano trees); and four levels of
       deflating (superfast, fast, normal, maximum compression).  <u>zipinfo</u> represents  these  methods  and  their
       sub-methods  as follows:  <u>stor</u>; <u>re:1</u>, <u>re:2</u>, etc.; <u>shrk</u>; <u>i4:2</u>, <u>i8:3</u>, etc.; <u>tokn</u>; and <u>defS</u>, <u>defF</u>, <u>defN</u>, and
       <u>defX</u>.

       The medium and long listings are almost identical to the short format except that they add information on
       the file's compression.  The medium format lists the file's compression factor as a percentage indicating
       the amount of space that has been ``removed'':

  -rw-rws---  1.5 unx    2802 t- 81% defX 11-Aug-91 13:48 perms.2660

       In this example, the file has been compressed by more than a factor of five; the compressed data are only
       19% of the original size.  The long format gives the compressed file's size in bytes, instead:

  -rw-rws---  1.5 unx    2802 t-     538 defX 11-Aug-91 13:48 perms.2660

       In contrast to the <u>unzip</u> listings, the compressed size figures in this listing format denote the complete
       size of compressed data, including the 12 extra header bytes in case of encrypted entries.

       Adding the <b>-T</b> option changes the file date and time to decimal format:

  -rw-rws---  1.5 unx    2802 t-     538 defX 910811.134804 perms.2660

       Note that because of limitations in the MS-DOS format used to store file  times,  the  seconds  field  is
       always  rounded  to the nearest even second.  For Unix files this is expected to change in the next major
       releases of <u><a href="../man1/zip.1.html">zip</a></u>(1) and <u>unzip</u>.

       In addition to individual file information, a default zipfile listing also includes  header  and  trailer
       lines:

  Archive:  OS2.zip   5453 bytes   5 files
  ,,rw,       1.0 hpf     730 b- i4:3 26-Jun-92 23:40 Contents
  ,,rw,       1.0 hpf    3710 b- i4:3 26-Jun-92 23:33 makefile.os2
  ,,rw,       1.0 hpf    8753 b- i8:3 26-Jun-92 15:29 os2unzip.c
  ,,rw,       1.0 hpf      98 b- stor 21-Aug-91 15:34 unzip.def
  ,,rw,       1.0 hpf      95 b- stor 21-Aug-91 17:51 zipinfo.def
  5 files, 13386 bytes uncompressed, 4951 bytes compressed:  63.0%

       The header line gives the name of the archive, its total size, and the total number of files; the trailer
       gives  the  number  of  files listed, their total uncompressed size, and their total compressed size (not
       including any of <u>zip</u>'s internal overhead).  If, however, one or more <u>file(s)</u> are provided, the header and
       trailer lines are not listed.  This behavior is also similar to that of  Unix's  ``ls  -l'';  it  may  be
       overridden  by  specifying the <b>-h</b> and <b>-t</b> options explicitly.  In such a case the listing format must also
       be specified explicitly, since <b>-h</b> or <b>-t</b> (or both) in the absence of other options implies that  ONLY  the
       header  or  trailer  line  (or  both)  is listed.  See the <b>EXAMPLES</b> section below for a semi-intelligible
       translation of this nonsense.

       The verbose listing is mostly self-explanatory.  It also lists file comments and the zipfile comment,  if
       any,  and the type and number of bytes in any stored extra fields.  Currently known types of extra fields
       include PKWARE's authentication (``AV'') info; OS/2 extended attributes; VMS filesystem info, both PKWARE
       and Info-ZIP versions; Macintosh resource forks; Acorn/Archimedes SparkFS info; and so on.  (Note that in
       the case of OS/2 extended attributes--perhaps the most common use of zipfile extra  fields--the  size  of
       the  stored  EAs as reported by <u>zipinfo</u> may not match the number given by OS/2's <u>dir</u> command: OS/2 always
       reports the number of bytes required  in  16-bit  format,  whereas  <u>zipinfo</u>  always  reports  the  32-bit
       storage.)

       Again,  the  compressed  size  figures  of  the  individual entries include the 12 extra header bytes for
       encrypted entries.  In contrast, the archive total compressed size  and  the  average  compression  ratio
       shown in the summary bottom line are calculated <b>without</b> the extra 12 header bytes of encrypted entries.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Modifying  <u>zipinfo</u>'s  default  behavior  via  options  placed  in  an  environment  variable can be a bit
       complicated to explain, due to <u>zipinfo</u>'s attempts to handle various defaults in an intuitive,  yet  Unix-
       like,  manner.   (Try  not to laugh.)  Nevertheless, there is some underlying logic.  In brief, there are
       three ``priority levels'' of options:  the default options; environment options, which  can  override  or
       add  to  the defaults; and explicit options given by the user, which can override or add to either of the
       above.

       The default listing format, as noted above, corresponds roughly to the  "zipinfo  -hst"  command  (except
       when individual zipfile members are specified).  A user who prefers the long-listing format (<b>-l</b>) can make
       use of the <u>zipinfo</u>'s environment variable to change this default:

       Unix Bourne shell:
              ZIPINFO=-l; export ZIPINFO

       Unix C shell:
              setenv ZIPINFO -l

       OS/2 or MS-DOS:
              set ZIPINFO=-l

       VMS (quotes for <u>lowercase</u>):
              define ZIPINFO_OPTS "-l"

       If,  in  addition,  the  user dislikes the trailer line, <u>zipinfo</u>'s concept of ``negative options'' may be
       used to override the default inclusion of the line.  This is  accomplished  by  preceding  the  undesired
       option  with  one or more minuses:  e.g., ``-l-t'' or ``--tl'', in this example.  The first hyphen is the
       regular switch character, but the one before the `t' is a minus sign.  The dual use of hyphens may seem a
       little awkward, but it's reasonably intuitive nonetheless:  simply ignore the first hyphen  and  go  from
       there.  It is also consistent with the behavior of the Unix command <u><a href="../man1/nice.1.html">nice</a></u>(1).

       As suggested above, the default variable names are ZIPINFO_OPTS for VMS (where the symbol used to install
       <u>zipinfo</u>  as a foreign command would otherwise be confused with the environment variable), and ZIPINFO for
       all other operating systems.  For compatibility with <u><a href="../man1/zip.1.html">zip</a></u>(1), ZIPINFOOPT is also accepted (don't ask).  If
       both ZIPINFO and ZIPINFOOPT are defined, however, ZIPINFO takes precedence.   <u>unzip</u>'s  diagnostic  option
       (<b>-v</b>  with  no  zipfile  name)  can  be  used  to  check the values of all four possible <u>unzip</u> and <u>zipinfo</u>
       environment variables.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To get a basic, short-format listing of the complete contents of a ZIP  archive  <u>storage.zip</u>,  with  both
       header and totals lines, use only the archive name as an argument to zipinfo:

       zipinfo storage

       To produce a basic, long-format listing (not verbose), including header and totals lines, use <b>-l</b>:

       zipinfo -l storage

       To list the complete contents of the archive without header and totals lines, either negate the <b>-h</b> and <b>-t</b>
       options or else specify the contents explicitly:

       zipinfo --h-t storage
       zipinfo storage \*

       (where  the  backslash  is required only if the shell would otherwise expand the `*' wildcard, as in Unix
       when globbing is turned on--double quotes around the asterisk would have worked as well).   To  turn  off
       the totals line by default, use the environment variable (C shell is assumed here):

       setenv ZIPINFO --t
       zipinfo storage

       To  get the full, short-format listing of the first example again, given that the environment variable is
       set as in the previous example, it is necessary to specify the <b>-s</b> option explicitly, since the <b>-t</b>  option
       by itself implies that ONLY the footer line is to be printed:

       setenv ZIPINFO --t
       zipinfo -t storage            [only totals line]
       zipinfo -st storage           [full listing]

       The  <b>-s</b>  option,  like  <b>-m</b>  and  <b>-l</b>, includes headers and footers by default, unless otherwise specified.
       Since the environment variable specified no footers and that has a higher  precedence  than  the  default
       behavior  of  <b>-s</b>, an explicit <b>-t</b> option was necessary to produce the full listing.  Nothing was indicated
       about the header, however, so the <b>-s</b> option was sufficient.  Note that both the <b>-h</b> and <b>-t</b>  options,  when
       used  by  themselves  or  with  each other, override any default listing of member files; only the header
       and/or footer are printed.  This behavior is  useful  when  <u>zipinfo</u>  is  used  with  a  wildcard  zipfile
       specification; the contents of all zipfiles are then summarized with a single command.

       To  list  information  on  a  single  file  within  the  archive,  in medium format, specify the filename
       explicitly:

       zipinfo -m storage unshrink.c

       The specification of any member file, as in this example, will override the  default  header  and  totals
       lines; only the single line of information about the requested file will be printed.  This is intuitively
       what  one  would expect when requesting information about a single file.  For multiple files, it is often
       useful to know the total compressed and uncompressed size; in such cases <b>-t</b> may be specified explicitly:

       zipinfo -mt storage "*.[ch]" Mak\*

       To get maximal information about the ZIP archive, use the verbose option.  It is usually wise to pipe the
       output into a filter such as Unix <u><a href="../man1/more.1.html">more</a></u>(1) if the operating system allows it:

       zipinfo -v storage | more

       Finally, to see the most recently modified files in the archive, use the <b>-T</b> option in conjunction with an
       external sorting utility such as Unix <u><a href="../man1/sort.1.html">sort</a></u>(1) (and <u><a href="../man1/sed.1.html">sed</a></u>(1) as well, in this example):

       zipinfo -T storage | sort -nr -k 7 | sed 15q

       The <b>-nr</b> option to <u><a href="../man1/sort.1.html">sort</a></u>(1) tells it to sort numerically in reverse order rather than in textual order, and
       the <b>-k</b> <b>7</b> option tells it to sort on the seventh field.  This assumes the default short-listing format; if
       <b>-m</b> or <b>-l</b> is used, the proper <u><a href="../man1/sort.1.html">sort</a></u>(1) option would be <b>-k</b> <b>8</b>.  Older versions of <u><a href="../man1/sort.1.html">sort</a></u>(1) do not support  the
       <b>-k</b>  option,  but  you  can  use  the  traditional <b>+</b> option instead, e.g., <b>+6</b> instead of <b>-k</b> <b>7</b>.  The <u><a href="../man1/sed.1.html">sed</a></u>(1)
       command filters out all but the  first  15  lines  of  the  listing.   Future  releases  of  <u>zipinfo</u>  may
       incorporate date/time and filename sorting as built-in options.

</pre><h4><b>TIPS</b></h4><pre>
       The  author  finds  it convenient to define an alias <u>ii</u> for <u>zipinfo</u> on systems that allow aliases (or, on
       other systems, copy/rename the executable, create a link or create a command file with the name <u>ii</u>).  The
       <u>ii</u> usage parallels the common <u>ll</u> alias for long listings in Unix, and the similarity between the  outputs
       of the two commands was intentional.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       As  with  <u>unzip</u>, <u>zipinfo</u>'s <b>-M</b> (``more'') option is overly simplistic in its handling of screen output; as
       noted above, it fails to detect the wrapping of long lines and may thereby cause lines at the top of  the
       screen  to  be  scrolled off before being read.  <u>zipinfo</u> should detect and treat each occurrence of line-
       wrap as one additional line printed.  This requires knowledge of  the  screen's  width  as  well  as  its
       height.  In addition, <u>zipinfo</u> should detect the true screen geometry on all systems.

       <u>zipinfo</u>'s listing-format behavior is unnecessarily complex and should be simplified.  (This is not to say
       that it will be.)
