</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sacctmgr - Used to view and modify Slurm account information.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sacctmgr</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>...] [<u>COMMAND</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sacctmgr</b>  is  used  to  view  or modify Slurm account information.  The account information is maintained
       within a database with the interface being provided by <b>slurmdbd</b> (Slurm Database daemon).   This  database
       can  serve  as  a  central storehouse of user and computer information for multiple computers at a single
       site.  Slurm account information is recorded based upon four parameters that form what is referred to  as
       an  <u>association</u>.   These  parameters  are  <u>user</u>, <u>cluster</u>, <u>partition</u>, and <u>account</u>. <u>user</u> is the login name.
       <u>cluster</u> is the name of a Slurm  managed  cluster  as  specified  by  the  <u>ClusterName</u>  parameter  in  the
       <u>slurm.conf</u>  configuration  file.  <u>partition</u> is the name of a Slurm partition on that cluster.  <u>account</u> is
       the bank account for a job.  The intended mode of operation is to initiate  the  <b>sacctmgr</b>  command,  add,
       delete, modify, and/or list <u>association</u> records then commit the changes and exit.

       <b>NOTE</b>:  The  contents  of Slurm's database are maintained in lower case.  This may result in some <b>sacctmgr</b>
       output differing from that of other Slurm commands.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-s</b>, <b>--associations</b>
              Use with show or list to display  associations  with  the  entity.   This  is  equivalent  to  the
              <b>associations</b> command.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print a help message describing the usage of <b>sacctmgr</b>.  This is equivalent to the <b>help</b> command.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--immediate</b>
              Commit changes immediately without asking for confirmation.

       <b>--json</b>, <b>--json</b>=<u>list</u>, <b>--json</b>=&lt;<u>data_parser</u>&gt;
              Dump  information  as  JSON  using  the  default  data_parser  plugin or explicit data_parser with
              parameters. Sorting and formatting arguments will be ignored.  This option is  not  available  for
              every command.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--noheader</b>
              No header will be added to the beginning of the output.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--parsable</b>

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--readonly</b>
              Makes it so the running sacctmgr cannot modify accounting information.  The <b>readonly</b> option is for
              use within interactive mode.

       <b>--yaml</b>, <b>--yaml</b>=<u>list</u>, <b>--yaml</b>=&lt;<u>data_parser</u>&gt;
              Dump  information  as  YAML  using  the  default  data_parser  plugin or explicit data_parser with
              parameters. Sorting and formatting arguments will be ignored.  This option is  not  available  for
              every command.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Enable detailed logging.  This is equivalent to the <b>verbose</b> command.

       <b>!!</b>     Repeat the last command.

</pre><h4><b>ENTITIES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>account</b>
              A bank account, typically specified at job submit time using the <b>--account=</b> option.  These may  be
              arranged in a hierarchical fashion, for example accounts 'chemistry' and 'physics' may be children
              of the account 'science'.  The hierarchy may have an arbitrary depth.

       <b>association</b>
              The  entity  used  to group information consisting of four parameters: <b>account</b>, <b>cluster</b>, <b>partition</b>
              (optional), and <b>user</b>.  Used only with the <b>list</b> or <b>show</b> command. Add, modify, and delete should  be
              done  to a user, account or cluster entity, which will in turn update the underlying associations.
              Modification of attributes like limits is allowed for an association but not a modification of the
              four core attributes of an association. You cannot change the partition setting (or set one if  it
              has  not been set) for an existing association. Instead, you will need to create a new association
              with the partition included. You can either  keep  the  previous  association  with  no  partition
              defined,  or  delete  it.  Note  that  these  newly added associations are unique entities and any
              existing usage information will not be carried over to the new association.

       <b>cluster</b>
              The <b>ClusterName</b> parameter in the <b>slurm.conf</b> configuration file, used to differentiate accounts  on
              different machines.

       <b>configuration</b>
              Used only with the <b>list</b> or <b>show</b> command to report current system configuration.

       <b>coordinator</b>
              A  special  privileged user, usually an account manager, that can add users or sub-accounts to the
              account they are coordinator over.  This should be a trusted person since they can  change  limits
              on  account  and user associations, as well as cancel, requeue or reassign accounts of jobs inside
              their realm.

       <b>event</b>  Events like downed or draining nodes on clusters.

       <b>federation</b>
              A group of clusters that work together to schedule jobs.

       <b>job</b>    Used to modify specific fields  of  a  job:  Derived  Exit  Code,  Comment,  AdminComment,  Extra,
              SystemComment, or WCKey.

       <b>problem</b>
              Use with <b>show</b> or <b>list</b> to display entity problems.

       <b>qos</b>    Quality of Service.

       <b>reservation</b>
              A  collection of resources set apart for use by a particular account, user or group of users for a
              given period of time.

       <b>resource</b>
              Software resources for the system. Those are software licenses shared among clusters.

       <b>RunawayJobs</b>
              Used only with the <b>list</b> or <b>show</b> command to report current jobs that  have  been  orphaned  on  the
              local cluster and are now runaway. If there are jobs in this state it will also give you an option
              to "fix" them.  <b>NOTE</b>: You must have an <b>AdminLevel</b> of at least <b>Operator</b> to perform this.

       <b>stats</b>  Used  with  <b>list</b> or <b>show</b> command to view server statistics.  Accepts optional argument of <b>ave_time</b>
              or <b>total_time</b> to sort on those fields. By default, sorts on increasing RPC count field.

       <b>transaction</b>
              List of transactions that have occurred during a given time period.

       <b>tres</b>   Used with <b>list</b> or <b>show</b> command to view a list of Trackable RESources configured on the system.

       <b>user</b>   The login name. Usernames are case-insensitive (forced to lowercase) unless  the  <b>PreserveCaseUser</b>
              option has been set in the SlurmDBD configuration file.

       <b>wckeys</b> Workload  Characterization  Key. An arbitrary  string  for  grouping orthogonal accounts.

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>ASSOCIATION</b> <b>BASED</b> <b>ENTITIES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>NOTE</b>:  The  group  limits  (GrpJobs,  GrpTRES,  etc.) are tested when a job is being considered for being
       allocated resources.  If starting a job would cause any of its group limit to be exceeded, that job  will
       not be considered for scheduling even if that job might preempt other jobs which would release sufficient
       group resources for the pending job to be initiated.

       <b>DefaultQOS</b>=&lt;<u>default_qos</u>&gt;
              The default QOS this association and its children should have.  This is overridden if set directly
              on a user.  To clear a previously set value use the modify command with a new value of -1.

       <b>Fairshare</b>={&lt;<u>fairshare_number</u>&gt;|parent}
       <b>Share</b>={&lt;<u>fairshare_number</u>&gt;|parent}
              Number  used  in conjunction with other accounts to determine job priority. Can also be the string
              <u>parent</u>, when used on a user this means that the parent  association  is  used  for  fairshare.  If
              Fairshare=parent is set on an account, that account's children will be effectively re-parented for
              fairshare  calculations  to  the first parent of their parent that is not Fairshare=parent. Limits
              remain the same, only its fairshare value is affected. To clear a previously  set  value  use  the
              modify command with a new value of -1.

       <b>GrpJobs</b>=&lt;<u>max_jobs</u>&gt;
              Maximum  number  of  running jobs in aggregate for this association and all associations which are
              children of this association.  To clear a previously set value use the modify command with  a  new
              value of -1.

       <b>GrpJobsAccrue</b>=&lt;<u>max_jobs</u>&gt;
              Maximum  number  of pending jobs in aggregate able to accrue age priority for this association and
              all associations which are children of this association.  To clear a previously set value use  the
              modify command with a new value of -1.

       <b>GrpSubmit</b>=&lt;<u>max_jobs</u>&gt;
       <b>GrpSubmitJobs</b>=&lt;<u>max_jobs</u>&gt;
              Maximum  number  of  jobs  which can be in a pending or running state at any time in aggregate for
              this association and all associations  which  are  children  of  this  association.   To  clear  a
              previously set value use the modify command with a new value of -1.

       <b>GrpTRES</b>=TRES=&lt;<u>max_TRES</u>&gt;[,TRES=&lt;<u>max_TRES</u>&gt;,...]
              Maximum number of TRES running jobs are able to be allocated in aggregate for this association and
              all  associations which are children of this association.  To clear a previously set value use the
              modify command with a new value of -1 for each TRES id.

              <b>TRES</b> can be one of the Slurm defaults (i.e. <u>cpu</u>,  <u>mem</u>,  <u>node</u>,  etc...),  or  any  defined  generic
              resource. You can see the list of available resources by running <b>sacctmgr</b> <b>show</b> <b>tres</b>.

       <b>GrpTRESMins</b>=TRES=&lt;<u>minutes</u>&gt;[,TRES=&lt;<u>minutes</u>&gt;,...]
              The  total  number  of  TRES  minutes  that  can possibly be used by past, present and future jobs
              running from this association and its children.  To clear a previously set value  use  the  modify
              command with a new value of -1 for each TRES id.

              <b>TRES</b>  can  be  one  of  the  Slurm  defaults (i.e. <u>cpu</u>, <u>mem</u>, <u>node</u>, etc...), or any defined generic
              resource. You can see the list of available resources by running <b>sacctmgr</b> <b>show</b> <b>tres</b>.

              <b>NOTE</b>: This limit is not enforced if set on the root association of a cluster. So  even  though  it
              may appear in sacctmgr output, it will not be enforced.

              <b>NOTE</b>:  This  limit  only  applies  when using the Priority Multifactor plugin. The time is decayed
              using the value of PriorityDecayHalfLife or PriorityUsageResetPeriod as  set  in  the  slurm.conf.
              When  this  limit  is  reached  all  associated  jobs  running  will be killed and all future jobs
              submitted with associations in the group will be delayed until they are able  to  run  inside  the
              limit.

       <b>GrpTRESRunMins</b>=TRES=&lt;<u>minutes</u>&gt;[,TRES=&lt;<u>minutes</u>&gt;,...]
              Used  to  limit  the  combined  total  number  of  TRES minutes used by all jobs running with this
              association and its children. This takes  into  consideration  time  limit  of  running  jobs  and
              consumes it, if the limit is reached no new jobs are started until other jobs finish to allow time
              to free up. To clear a previously set value use the modify command with a new value of -1 for each
              TRES id.

              <b>TRES</b>  can  be  one  of  the  Slurm  defaults (i.e. <u>cpu</u>, <u>mem</u>, <u>node</u>, etc...), or any defined generic
              resource. You can see the list of available resources by running <b>sacctmgr</b> <b>show</b> <b>tres</b>.

       <b>GrpWall</b>=&lt;<u>max_wall</u>&gt;
              Maximum wall clock time running jobs are able to be allocated in aggregate  for  this  association
              and  all associations which are children of this association.  To clear a previously set value use
              the modify command with a new value of -1.

              <b>NOTE</b>: This limit is not enforced if set on the root association of a cluster. So  even  though  it
              may appear in sacctmgr output, it will not be enforced.

              <b>NOTE</b>:  This  limit  only  applies  when using the Priority Multifactor plugin. The time is decayed
              using the value of PriorityDecayHalfLife or PriorityUsageResetPeriod as  set  in  the  slurm.conf.
              When  this  limit  is  reached  all  associated  jobs  running  will be killed and all future jobs
              submitted with associations in the group will be delayed until they are able  to  run  inside  the
              limit.

       <b>MaxJobs</b>=&lt;<u>max_jobs</u>&gt;
              Maximum  number  of  jobs  each  user  is allowed to run at one time in this association.  This is
              overridden if set directly on a user.  Default is the cluster's limit.  To clear a previously  set
              value use the modify command with a new value of -1.

       <b>MaxJobsAccrue</b>=&lt;<u>max_jobs</u>&gt;
              Maximum  number  of  pending  jobs  able  to  accrue  age priority at any given time for the given
              association.  This is overridden if set directly on a user.  Default is the cluster's  limit.   To
              clear a previously set value use the modify command with a new value of -1.

       <b>MaxSubmit</b>=&lt;<u>max_jobs</u>&gt;
       <b>MaxSubmitJobs</b>=&lt;<u>max_jobs</u>&gt;
              Maximum  number of jobs which this association can have in a pending or running state at any time.

              Maximum number of TRES minutes each job is able to use in this association.  This is overridden if
              set directly on a user.  Default is the cluster's limit.  To clear a previously set value use  the
              modify command with a new value of -1 for each TRES id.

              &lt;hr&gt;:&lt;min&gt;:&lt;sec&gt; or &lt;days&gt;-&lt;hr&gt;:&lt;min&gt;:&lt;sec&gt; or &lt;days&gt;-&lt;hr&gt;.  The value is recorded in minutes with
              rounding  as  needed.   To clear a previously set value use the modify command with a new value of
              -1.

              <b>NOTE</b>: Changing this value will have no effect on any running or pending job.

       <b>Priority</b>
              What priority will be added to a job's priority when using this association.  This  is  overridden
              if  set  directly on a user.  Default is the cluster's limit.  To clear a previously set value use
              the modify command with a new value of -1.

       <b>QosLevel</b>&lt;<u>operator</u>&gt;&lt;<u>comma_separated_list_of_qos_names</u>&gt;
              Specify the default Quality of Service's that jobs are able to run at for this association. To get
              a list of valid QOSs use 'sacctmgr list qos'.  This value will override its parents value and push
              down to its children as the new default. Setting a QosLevel to '' (two single quotes with  nothing
              between  them)  restores  its  default  setting. You can also use the operator += and -= to add or
              remove certain QOSs from a QOS list.

              Valid &lt;operator&gt; values include:

              <b>=</b>
                   Set <u>QosLevel</u> to the specified value. <b>NOTE</b>: the QOS that can be used at a given account in the
                   hierarchy are inherited by the children of that account.  By assigning QOS with  the  <b>=</b>  sign
                   only the assigned QOS can be used by the account and its children.
              <b>+=</b>
                     Add the specified &lt;qos&gt; value to the current <u>QosLevel</u>. The account will have access to this
                     QOS and the other previously assigned to it.
              <b>-=</b>
                     Remove the specified &lt;qos&gt; value from the current <u>QosLevel</u>.

       See the <b>EXAMPLES</b> section below.

              Used  to  limit  the  combined  total  number  of  TRES minutes used by all jobs running with this
              association and its children. This takes  into  consideration  time  limit  of  running  jobs  and
              consumes it, if the limit is reached no new jobs are started until other jobs finish to allow time

       Job information is automatically sent to slurmdbd to be stored.  These are options  you  can  specify  to
       filter for specific jobs. There are also some attributes you can modify for a job record.

       <b>AdminComment</b>=&lt;<u>admin_comment</u>&gt;
              Arbitrary  descriptive  string.  Can  only  be  modified  by  a  Slurm  administrator.  To clear a
              previously set value, use the modify command with a new  value  of  ''  (two  single  quotes  with
              nothing between them).

       <b>Comment</b>=&lt;<u>comment</u>&gt;
              The  job's  comment string when the AccountingStoreFlags parameter in the slurm.conf file contains
              'job_comment'. The user can only modify the comment string of their own job. To clear a previously
              set value, use the modify command with a new value of '' (two single quotes with  nothing  between
              them).

       <b>Cluster</b>=&lt;<u>cluster_list</u>&gt;
              List of clusters to alter jobs on, defaults to local cluster.

       <b>DerivedExitCode</b>=&lt;<u>derived_exit_code</u>&gt;
              The  derived  exit  code  can  be  modified  after a job completes based on the user's judgment of
              whether the job succeeded or failed. The user can only modify the derived exit code of  their  own
              job.

       <b>EndTime</b>
              Jobs  must  end  before  this  time  to be modified. Format output is, YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS, unless
              changed through the SLURM_TIME_FORMAT environment variable.

       <b>Extra</b>=&lt;<u>extra</u>&gt;
              The job's extra string when the AccountingStoreFlags parameter in  the  slurm.conf  file  contains
              'job_extra'. The user can only modify the extra string of their own job. To clear a previously set
              value,  use  the  modify  command  with  a new value of '' (two single quotes with nothing between
              them).

       <b>JobID</b>=&lt;<u>jobid_list</u>&gt;
              The id of the job to change. Not needed if altering multiple jobs using wckey specification.

       <b>NewWCKey</b>=&lt;<u>new_wckey</u>&gt;
              Use to rename a wckey on job(s) in the accounting database

       <b>StartTime</b>
              Jobs must start at or after this time to be modified in the same format as <b>EndTime</b>.

       <b>SystemComment</b>=&lt;<u>system_comment</u>&gt;
              Arbitrary descriptive string, usually managed by the BurstBufferPlugin.  Can only be modified by a
              Slurm administrator. To clear a previously set value, use the modify command with a new  value  of
              '' (two single quotes with nothing between them).

       <b>User</b>=&lt;<u>user_list</u>&gt;
              Used to specify the jobs of users jobs to alter.

       <b>WCKey</b>=&lt;<u>wckey_list</u>&gt;
              Used to specify the wckeys to alter.

       The <u>AdminComment</u>, <u>Comment</u>, <u>DerivedExitCode</u>, <u>Extra</u>, <u>SystemComment</u>, and <u>WCKey</u> fields are the only fields of
       a job record in the database that can be modified after job completion.

</pre><h4><b>LIST/SHOW</b> <b>JOB</b> <b>FORMAT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>sacct</b> command is the exclusive command to display job records from the Slurm database.

</pre><h4><b>SPECIFICATIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>QOS</b></h4><pre>
       A  QOS  can  be  created,  modified,  and  deleted  with  sacctmgr.  These  options  allow you to set the
       corresponding attributes or filter on them when querying for a QOS.

       <b>NOTE</b>: The group limits (GrpJobs, GrpTRES, etc.) are tested when a  job  is  being  considered  for  being
       allocated  resources.  If starting a job would cause any of its group limit to be exceeded, that job will
       not be considered for scheduling even if that job might preempt other jobs which would release sufficient
       group resources for the pending job to be initiated.

       <b>Description</b>
              An arbitrary string describing a QOS. Can only be modified by a Slurm administrator.

       <b>Flags</b>  Used by the slurmctld to override or enforce certain characteristics.  To clear a  previously  set
              value use the modify command with a new value of -1.
              Valid options are

              <b>DenyOnLimit</b>
                     If  set,  jobs using this QOS will be rejected at submission time if they do not conform to
                     the QOS 'Max' or 'Min' limits as stand-alone jobs.  Jobs  that  exceed  these  limits  when
                     other  jobs are considered, but conform to the limits when considered individually will not
                     be rejected. Instead they will pend until resources  are  available.   Group  limits  (e.g.
                     <b>GrpTRES</b>)  will  also  be  treated  like 'Max' limits (e.g. <b>MaxTRESPerNode</b>) and jobs will be
                     denied if they would violate the limit as stand-alone jobs.  This currently only applies to
                     QOS and Association limits.

              <b>EnforceUsageThreshold</b>
                     If set, and the QOS also has a UsageThreshold, any jobs submitted with this QOS  that  fall
                     below the UsageThreshold will be held until their Fairshare Usage goes above the Threshold.

              <b>NoDecay</b>
                     If  set,  this  QOS  will  not  have  its  GrpTRESMins, GrpWall and UsageRaw decayed by the
                     slurm.conf PriorityDecayHalfLife or PriorityUsageResetPeriod settings. This allows a QOS to
                     provide aggregate limits that, once consumed, will not be replenished automatically. Such a
                     QOS will act as a time-limited quota of resources for an association that has access to it.
                     Account/user usage  will  still  be  decayed  for  associations  using  the  QOS.  The  QOS
                     GrpTRESMins and GrpWall limits can be increased or the QOS RawUsage value reset to 0 (zero)
                     to  again  allow  jobs  submitted with this QOS to be queued (if DenyOnLimit is set) or run
                     (pending with QOSGrp{TRES}MinutesLimit or QOSGrpWallLimit reasons,  where  {TRES}  is  some
                     type of trackable resource).

              <b>NoReserve</b>
                     If  this  flag is set and backfill scheduling is used, jobs using this QOS will not reserve
                     resources in the backfill schedule's map of resources allocated through time. This flag  is
                     intended  for  use  with  a QOS that may be preempted by jobs associated with all other QOS
                     (e.g use with a "standby" QOS). If this flag is used with a QOS which can not be  preempted
                     by all other QOS, it could result in starvation of larger jobs.

              <b>OverPartQOS</b>
                     If  set  jobs  using  this  QOS  will  be able to override any limits used by the requested
                     partition's QOS limits.

              <b>PartitionMaxNodes</b>
                     If set jobs using this QOS will be able to  override  the  requested  partition's  MaxNodes
                     limit.

              <b>PartitionMinNodes</b>
                     If  set  jobs  using  this  QOS will be able to override the requested partition's MinNodes
                     limit.

              <b>PartitionTimeLimit</b>
                     If set jobs using this QOS will be able to override the requested partition's TimeLimit.

              <b>Relative</b>
                     If set, the QOS limits will be treated as percentages of the cluster or  partition  instead
                     of  absolute  limits (numbers should be less than 100).  The controller should be restarted
                     or reconfigured after adding the <u>Relative</u> flag to the QOS.
                     If this is used as a partition QOS:

                     1. Limits will be calculated relative to the partition's resources.
                     2. Only one partition may have this QOS as its partition QOS.
                     3. Jobs will not be allowed to use it as a normal QOS.

              Additional details are in the QOS documentation at &lt;https://slurm.schedmd.com/qos.html&gt;.

              <b>RequiresReservation</b>
                     If set jobs using this QOS must designate a reservation when submitting a job.  This option
                     can be useful in restricting usage of a QOS that may have greater preemptive capability  or
                     additional resources to be allowed only within a reservation.

              <b>UsageFactorSafe</b>
                     If  set,  and  <u>AccountingStorageEnforce</u> includes <u>Safe</u>, jobs will only be able to run if the
                     job can run to completion with the <u>UsageFactor</u> applied.

       <b>GraceTime</b>
              Preemption grace time, in seconds, to be extended to a job which has been selected for preemption.
              The default value is zero, no preemption grace time is allowed on this QOS.  This  value  is  only
              meaningful for QOS <u>PreemptMode=CANCEL</u> and <u>PreemptMode=REQUEUE</u>.

       <b>GrpJobs</b>
              Maximum number of running jobs in aggregate for this QOS.  To clear a previously set value use the
              modify command with a new value of -1.

       <b>GrpJobsAccrue</b>
              Maximum  number of pending jobs in aggregate able to accrue age priority for this QOS.  This limit
              only applies to the job's QOS and not the partition's QOS.  To clear a previously  set  value  use
              the modify command with a new value of -1.

       <b>GrpSubmit</b>
       <b>GrpSubmitJobs</b>
              Maximum  number  of  jobs  which can be in a pending or running state at any time in aggregate for
              this QOS.  To clear a previously set value use the modify command with a new value of -1.

       <b>GrpTRES</b>
              Maximum number of TRES running jobs are able to be allocated in aggregate for this QOS.  To  clear
              a previously set value use the modify command with a new value of -1 for each TRES id.

              <b>TRES</b>  can  be  one  of  the  Slurm  defaults (i.e. <u>cpu</u>, <u>mem</u>, <u>node</u>, etc...), or any defined generic
              resource. You can see the list of available resources by running <b>sacctmgr</b> <b>show</b> <b>tres</b>.

       <b>GrpTRESMins</b>
              The total number of TRES minutes that can possibly be  used  by  past,  present  and  future  jobs
              running from this QOS.  To clear a previously set value use the modify command with a new value of
              -1 for each TRES id.

              <b>TRES</b>  can  be  one  of  the  Slurm  defaults (i.e. <u>cpu</u>, <u>mem</u>, <u>node</u>, etc...), or any defined generic
              resource. You can see the list of available resources by running <b>sacctmgr</b> <b>show</b> <b>tres</b>.

              <b>NOTE</b>: This limit only applies when using the Priority Multifactor  plugin.  The  time  is  decayed
              using  the  value  of  PriorityDecayHalfLife or PriorityUsageResetPeriod as set in the slurm.conf.
              When this limit is reached all associated  jobs  running  will  be  killed  and  all  future  jobs
              submitted with this QOS will be delayed until they are able to run inside the limit.

       <b>GrpTRESRunMins</b>
              Used  to  limit  the combined total number of TRES minutes used by all jobs running with this QOS.
              This takes into consideration time limit of running jobs and consumes it, if the limit is  reached

              <b>NOTE</b>: This limit only applies when using the Priority Multifactor  plugin.  The  time  is  decayed
              using  the  value  of  PriorityDecayHalfLife or PriorityUsageResetPeriod as set in the slurm.conf.
              When this limit is reached all associated  jobs  running  will  be  killed  and  all  future  jobs
              submitted with this QOS will be delayed until they are able to run inside the limit.

       <b>LimitFactor</b>
              A  float  that  is  factored  into  an  associations  [Grp|Max]TRES  limits.  For  example, if the

       <b>Name</b>   Name of the QOS. Needed for creation.

       <b>Preempt</b>
              Other QOSs this QOS can preempt. To clear a previously set value, use the modify  command  with  a
              new value of '' (two single quotes with nothing between them).

              <b>NOTE</b>: The <u>Priority</u> of a QOS is NOT related to QOS preemption, only <u>Preempt</u> is used to define which
              QOS can preempt others.

       <b>PreemptExemptTime</b>
              Specifies  a minimum run time for jobs of this QOS before they are considered for preemption. This
              QOS option  takes  precedence  over  the  global  <u>PreemptExemptTime</u>.  This  is  only  honored  for
              <b>PreemptMode=REQUEUE</b> and <b>PreemptMode=CANCEL</b>.
              Setting  to  -1  disables  the  option,  allowing another QOS or the global option to take effect.
              Setting to 0 indicates no minimum run time and supersedes the lower priority QOS (see <u>OverPartQOS</u>)
              and/or the global option in slurm.conf.

       <b>PreemptMode</b>
              Mechanism used to preempt jobs or enable gang scheduling for this QOS when the cluster <u>PreemptType</u>
              is set to <u>preempt/qos</u>.  This QOS-specific <b>PreemptMode</b> will override the  cluster-wide  <b>PreemptMode</b>
              for  this QOS. Unsetting the QOS specific <b>PreemptMode</b>, by specifying "OFF", "" or "Cluster", makes
              it use the default cluster-wide <b>PreemptMode</b>.
              The <b>GANG</b> option is used to enable gang scheduling independent of  whether  preemption  is  enabled
              (i.e.  independent  of  the <b>PreemptType</b> setting). It can be specified in addition to a <b>PreemptMode</b>
              setting with the two options comma separated (e.g. <b>PreemptMode=SUSPEND,GANG</b>).
              See &lt;https://slurm.schedmd.com/preempt.html&gt; and  &lt;https://slurm.schedmd.com/gang_scheduling.html&gt;
              for more details.

              <b>NOTE</b>:  For  performance reasons, the backfill scheduler reserves whole nodes for jobs, not partial
              nodes. If during backfill scheduling a job preempts one or more other jobs, the  whole  nodes  for
              those preempted jobs are reserved for the preemptor job, even if the preemptor job requested fewer
              resources  than  that.   These  reserved nodes aren't available to other jobs during that backfill
              cycle, even if the other jobs could fit on the nodes. Therefore, jobs may preempt  more  resources
              during a single backfill iteration than they requested.
              <b>NOTE</b>:  For  heterogeneous  job to be considered for preemption all components must be eligible for
              preemption. When a heterogeneous job is to be preempted the first identified component of the  job
              with  the  highest order PreemptMode (<b>SUSPEND</b> (highest), <b>REQUEUE</b>, <b>CANCEL</b> (lowest)) will be used to
              set the PreemptMode for all components. The <b>GraceTime</b> and user warning signal for  each  component
              of  the  heterogeneous  job  remain  unique.  Heterogeneous jobs are excluded from GANG scheduling
              operations.

              <b>OFF</b>         Is the default value and disables job preemption and  gang  scheduling.   It  is  only
                          compatible with <b>PreemptType=preempt/none</b> at a global level.

              <b>CANCEL</b>      The preempted job will be cancelled.

              <b>GANG</b>        Enables  gang  scheduling (time slicing) of jobs in the same partition, and allows the
                          resuming of suspended jobs.  Configure the <u>OverSubscribe</u>  setting  to  <u>FORCE</u>  for  all
                          partitions  in  which  time-slicing  is  to  take place.  Gang scheduling is performed
                          independently for each partition, so if you only want time-slicing  by  <b>OverSubscribe</b>,
                          without  any  preemption,  then  configuring  partitions with overlapping nodes is not
                          recommended.  Time-slicing won't happen between jobs on different partitions.

                          <b>NOTE</b>: Heterogeneous jobs are excluded from GANG scheduling operations.

              <b>REQUEUE</b>     Preempts jobs by requeuing them (if possible) or  canceling  them.   For  jobs  to  be
                          requeued they must have the --requeue sbatch option set or the cluster wide JobRequeue
                          parameter in slurm.conf must be set to <b>1</b>.

              <b>SUSPEND</b>     The  preempted  jobs will be suspended, and later the Gang scheduler will resume them.
                          Therefore the <b>SUSPEND</b> preemption mode always needs the <b>GANG</b> option to be specified  at
                          the  cluster  level.  Also,  because  the  suspended jobs will still use memory on the
                          allocated nodes, Slurm needs to be able to  track  memory  resources  to  be  able  to
                          suspend jobs.
                          If <b>PreemptType=preempt/qos</b> is configured and if the preempted job(s) and the preemptor
                          job  are on the same partition, then they will share resources with the Gang scheduler
                          (time-slicing). If not  (i.e.  if  the  preemptees  and  preemptor  are  on  different
                          partitions) then the preempted jobs will remain suspended until the preemptor ends.

                          <b>NOTE</b>:  Suspended  jobs will not release GRES. Higher priority jobs will not be able to
                          preempt to gain access to GRES.

              <b>WITHIN</b>      Allows  for  preemption   between   jobs   sharing   the   same   qos.   By   default,
                          <b>PreemptType=preempt/qos</b>  will only consider jobs to be eligible for preemption if they
                          do not share the same qos value.

       <b>Priority</b>
              What priority will be added to a job's priority when using this QOS.

              <b>NOTE</b>: The <u>Priority</u> of a QOS is NOT related to QOS preemption, see <u>Preempt</u> instead.

       <b>RawUsage</b>=&lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              This allows an administrator to set the raw usage accrued to a QOS. Specifying a value of 0 (zero)
              will reset the raw usage. This is a settable specification only - it cannot be used as a filter to
              list accounts.

       <b>UsageFactor</b>
              A float that is factored into a job's TRES  usage  (e.g.  RawUsage,  TRESMins,  TRESRunMins).  For
              example,  if  the usagefactor was 2, for every TRESBillingUnit second a job ran it would count for
              2. If the usagefactor was .5, every second would only count for half of the time. A setting  of  0
              would add no timed usage from the job.

              The usage factor only applies to the job's QOS and not the partition QOS.

              If  the  <u>UsageFactorSafe</u> flag <u>is</u> set and <u>AccountingStorageEnforce</u> includes <u>Safe</u>, jobs will only be
              started if they can run to completion with the <u>UsageFactor</u> applied, and won't  be  killed  due  to
              limits.

              If  the  <u>UsageFactorSafe</u>  flag is <u>not</u> set and <u>AccountingStorageEnforce</u> includes <u>Safe</u>, jobs will be
              started if they can run to completion without the <u>UsageFactor</u> applied, and won't be killed due  to
              limits.

              If  the  <u>UsageFactorSafe</u>  flag is <u>not</u> set and <u>AccountingStorageEnforce</u> does not include <u>Safe</u>, jobs
              will be scheduled as long as the limits are not reached, but could be killed due to limits.

              See <u>AccountingStorageEnforce</u> in slurm.conf man page.

              Default is 1. To clear a previously set value use the modify command with a new value of -1.

       <b>UsageThreshold</b>
              A float representing the lowest fairshare of  an  association  allowable  to  run  a  job.  If  an
              association falls below this threshold and has pending jobs or submits new jobs those jobs will be
              held  until  the  usage  goes  back  above  the threshold. Use <u>sshare</u> to see current shares on the
              system.  To clear a previously set value use the modify command with a new value of -1.

              the resource will not be displayed with this flag.

       <b>WithDeleted</b>
              Display  information  with previously deleted data.  Resources that are deleted within 24 hours of
              being created will be removed from the database. Resources that were created more  than  24  hours
              prior to the deletion request are just marked as deleted and will be viewable with the <b>WithDeleted</b>
              flag.

       <b>NOTE</b>:  Resource  is  used  to  define  each  resource configured on a system available for usage by Slurm
       clusters.

       <u>OPTIONS</u> section.

</pre><h4><b>SPECIFICATIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>USERS</b></h4><pre>
       Users can be created,  modified,  and  deleted  with  sacctmgr.  These  options  allow  you  to  set  the
       corresponding attributes or filter on them when querying for Users.

       It  is  important  to recognize the difference between a User and an Association.  There is a User entity
       that exists for each unique username. However, there can be multiple User Associations for the same User.
       The combination of a Cluster, Account, User, and optionally a Partition constitute  a  User  Association.
       When  adding  an existing User to another Account, you are creating an additional User Association rather
       than modifying an existing User.

       <b>Account</b>=&lt;<u>account</u>&gt;
              Account name to add this user to.

       <b>AdminLevel</b>=&lt;<u>level</u>&gt;
              Admin level of user. Valid levels are None, Operator, and Admin.

       <b>Cluster</b>=&lt;<u>cluster</u>&gt;
              Specific cluster to add user to the account on. Default is all in system.

       <b>DefaultAccount</b>=&lt;<u>account</u>&gt;
              Identify the default bank account name to be used for a job if none  is  specified  at  submission
              time.

       <b>DefaultWCKey</b>=&lt;<u>defaultwckey</u>&gt;
              Identify the default Workload Characterization Key.

       <b>Name</b>=&lt;<u>name</u>&gt;
              Name of user.

       <b>NewName</b>=&lt;<u>newname</u>&gt;
              Use to rename a user in the accounting database

       <b>Partition</b>=&lt;<u>name</u>&gt;
              Partition name.

       <b>NOTE</b>: See also <b>Partitions</b> listed in the <u>SPECIFICATIONS</u> <u>FOR</u> <u>ASSOCIATIONS</u> section.

       <b>RawUsage</b>=&lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              This  allows  an administrator to reset the raw usage accrued to a user.  The only value currently
              supported is 0 (zero). This is a settable specification only - it cannot be used as  a  filter  to
              list users.

       <b>WCKeys</b>=&lt;<u>wckeys</u>&gt;
              Workload Characterization Key values.

       <b>WithAssoc</b>
              Display all associations for this user.

       <b>WithCoord</b>
              Display all accounts a user is coordinator for.

       <b>WithDeleted</b>
              Display information with previously deleted data.  Users that are deleted within 24 hours of being
              created and did not have a job run by the user during that time will be removed from the database.
              Otherwise, the user will be marked as deleted and will be viewable with the <b>WithDeleted</b> flag.

       <b>NOTE</b>:  If  using the WithAssoc option you can also query against association specific information to view
       only certain associations this user may have. These extra options can be found in the <u>SPECIFICATIONS</u>  <u>FOR</u>
       <u>ASSOCIATIONS</u>   section.  You  can  also  use  the  general  specifications  list  above  in  the  <u>GENERAL</u>
       <u>SPECIFICATIONS</u> <u>FOR</u> <u>ASSOCIATION</u> <u>BASED</u> <u>ENTITIES</u> section.

</pre><h4><b>LIST/SHOW</b> <b>USER</b> <b>FORMAT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>

              Admin level of user.

       <b>Coordinators</b>
              List  of  users  that  are  a  coordinator  of  the  account.  (Only  filled  in  when  using  the
              WithCoordinator option.)

       <b>DefaultAccount</b>
              The user's default account.

       <b>DefaultWCKey</b>
              The user's default wckey.

       <b>User</b>   The name of a user.

       <b>NOTE</b>:  If using the WithAssoc option you can also view the information about the various associations the
       user may have on all the clusters in the system. The association information can be filtered.  Note  that
       all the users in the database will always be shown as filter only takes effect over the association data.
       The Association format fields are described in the <u>LIST/SHOW</u> <u>ASSOCIATION</u> <u>FORMAT</u> <u>OPTIONS</u> section.

</pre><h4><b>LIST/SHOW</b> <b>WCKey</b></h4><pre>
       Fields you can display when viewing WCKey records by using the <u>format=</u> option. The default format is:
       WCKey,Cluster,User

       <b>Cluster</b>
              Specific cluster for the WCKey.

       <b>ID</b>     The ID of the WCKey.

       <b>User</b>   The name of a user for the WCKey.

       <b>WCKey</b>  Workload Characterization Key.

       <b>WithDeleted</b>
              Display  information  with  previously  deleted  data.  WCKeys that are deleted within 24 hours of
              being created and did not have a job run with the WCKey during that time will be removed from  the
              database.   Otherwise,  the  WCKey  will  be  marked  as  deleted  and  will  be viewable with the
              <b>WithDeleted</b> flag.

</pre><h4><b>LIST/SHOW</b> <b>TRES</b></h4><pre>
       Fields you can display when viewing TRES records by using the <u>format=</u> option. The default format is:
       Type,Name,ID

       <b>ID</b>     The identification number of the trackable resource as it appears in the database.

       <b>Name</b>   The name of the trackable resource. This option is required for  TRES  types  BB  (Burst  buffer),
              GRES,  and  License. Types CPU, Energy, Memory, and Node do not have Names. For example if GRES is
              the type then name is the denomination of the GRES itself e.g. GPU.

       <b>Type</b>   The type of the trackable resource. Current types  are  BB  (Burst  buffer),  CPU,  Energy,  GRES,
              License, Memory, and Node.

</pre><h4><b>TRES</b> <b>information</b></h4><pre>
       Trackable  RESources (TRES) are used in many QOS or Association limits.  When setting the limits they are
       comma separated list. Each TRES has a  different  limit,  i.e.  GrpTRESMins=cpu=10,mem=20  would  make  2
       different  limits  1  for 10 cpu minutes and 1 for 20 MB memory minutes.  This is the case for each limit
       that deals with TRES. To remove the limit -1 is used i.e. GrpTRESMins=cpu=-1 would remove  only  the  cpu
       TRES limit.

       <b>NOTE</b>: When dealing with Memory as a TRES all limits are in MB.

       <b>NOTE</b>:  The Billing TRES is calculated from a partition's TRESBillingWeights. It is temporarily calculated
       during scheduling for each partition to enforce billing TRES limits. The final Billing TRES is calculated
       after the job has been allocated resources. The final number can be seen in <b>scontrol</b> <b>show</b> <b>jobs</b> and  <b>sacct</b>
       output.

</pre><h4><b>GLOBAL</b> <b>FORMAT</b> <b>OPTION</b></h4><pre>
       When  using  the format option for listing various fields you can put a %NUMBER afterwards to specify how
       many characters should be printed.

       e.g. format=name%30 will print 30 characters  of  field  name  right  justified.  A  -30  will  print  30
       characters left justified.

</pre><h4><b>FLAT</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>DUMP</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LOAD</b></h4><pre>
       sacctmgr  has  the capability to load and dump Slurm association data to and from a file. This method can
       easily add a new cluster or copy an existing cluster's associations  into  a  new  cluster  with  similar
       accounts.  Each  file contains Slurm association data for a single cluster. Be aware that QOS information
       is not currently included in the information that can be  dumped  to  a  file.  QOS  information  can  be
       retrieved and loaded using the REST API or it must be transferred to a new cluster manually. Comments can
       be  put  into  the  file  with the # character.  Each line of information must begin with one of the four
       titles; <b>Cluster</b>, <b>Parent</b>, <b>Account</b> or <b>User</b>. Following the title is a space, dash, space, entity value, then
       specifications. Specifications are colon separated. If any variable, such as an Organization name, has  a
       space in it, surround the name with single or double quotes.

       sacctmgr  dump/load  must  be  run as a Slurm administrator or root. If using sacctmgr load on a database
       without any associations, it must be run as root (because there aren't any users in the database yet).

   <b>dump</b>
       Dump cluster associations from the database into a file. If no file is given then one will be  generated,
       using the cluster name for the file name. That file will be created in the current working directory.

       To create a file with the association information you can run:

       sacctmgr dump tux file=tux.cfg

              <b>Cluster=</b>
                     Specify the cluster to dump the information for.

              <b>File=</b>  Specify  a  file  to  save  flat  file  data  to.  If the filename is not specified it uses
                     clustername.cfg filename by default.

   <b>load</b>
       Load cluster associations into the database. The imported associations will be reconciled  with  existing
       ones.

       To load a previously created file you can run:

       sacctmgr load file=tux.cfg

              <b>clean</b>  Delete what was already there and start from scratch with this information.

              <b>Cluster=</b>
                     Specify a different name for the cluster than that which is in the file.

              <b>File=</b>  Specify a flat file to load from.

</pre><h4><b>SPECIFICATIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>FLAT</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       Since  the  associations  in  the  system follow a hierarchy, so does the file. Anything that is a parent
       needs to be defined before any children. The only exception is the understood  'root'  account.  This  is
       always a default for any cluster and does not need to be defined.

       To edit/create a file start with a cluster line for the new cluster:

       <b>Cluster</b> <b>-</b> <b>cluster_name:MaxTRESPerJob=node=15</b>

       Anything  included on this line will be the default for all associations on this cluster. The options for
       the cluster are:

              <b>FairShare=</b>
                     Number used in conjunction with other associations to determine job priority.

              <b>GrpJobs=</b>

                     are children of this association.

              <b>GrpJobsAccrue=</b>
                     Maximum number of  pending  jobs  in  aggregate  able  to  accrue  age  priority  for  this
                     association and all associations which are children of this association.

              <b>GrpNodes=</b>
                     This  option  has  been  deprecated  in favor of the more versatile TRES.  Equivalent limit
                     definition is now <b>GrpTRES=node=#</b>.

              <b>GrpSubmitJobs=</b>
                     Maximum number of jobs which can be in a pending or running state at any time in  aggregate

              <b>GrpTRESRunMins=</b>
                     Used to limit the combined total number of TRES minutes used by all jobs running with  this
                     association  and its children. This takes into consideration time limit of running jobs and
                     consumes it, if the limit is reached no new jobs are started until  other  jobs  finish  to
                     allow time to free up.

              <b>GrpWall=</b>
                     Maximum  wall  clock  time  running  jobs  are  able  to be allocated in aggregate for this
                     association and all associations which are children of this association.

              <b>MaxJobs=</b>

              <b>QOS=</b>   Comma separated list of Quality of Service names (Defined in sacctmgr).

       After the entry for the root account you will have entries for the other  accounts  on  the  system.  The
       entries will look similar to this example:

       <b>Parent</b> <b>-</b> <b>root</b>
       <b>Account</b> <b>-</b> <b>cs:MaxTRESPerJob=node=5:MaxJobs=4:FairShare=399:MaxWallDurationPerJob=40:Description='Computer</b> <b>Science':Organization='LC'</b>
       <b>Parent</b> <b>-</b> <b>cs</b>
       <b>Account</b> <b>-</b> <b>test:MaxTRESPerJob=node=1:MaxJobs=1:FairShare=1:MaxWallDurationPerJob=1:Description='Test</b> <b>Account':Organization='Test'</b>

       Any  of the options after a ':' can be left out and they can be in any order.  If you want to add any sub
       accounts just list the Parent THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN CREATED before the account you are adding.

       Account options are:

              <b>Description=</b>
                     A brief description of the account.

              <b>FairShare=</b>

</pre><h4><b>ARCHIVE</b> <b>FUNCTIONALITY</b></h4><pre>
       Sacctmgr has the capability to archive to a flatfile and or load that data if needed later. The archiving
       is usually done by the slurmdbd and it is highly recommended you only  do  it  through  sacctmgr  if  you
       completely  understand  what you are doing. For slurmdbd options see "man slurmdbd" for more information.
       Loading data into the database can be done from these files to either view old data or regenerate  rolled
       up      data.       For      information      about     configuring     an     archive     server     see
       &lt;https://slurm.schedmd.com/accounting.html#archive&gt;.

   <b>archive</b> <b>dump</b>
       Dump accounting data to file. Data will not be archived unless the corresponding purge option is included
       in this command or in slurmdbd.conf.  This operation cannot be rolled back once executed. If one  of  the
       following  options  is  not  specified  when sacctmgr is called, the value configured in slurmdbd.conf is
       used.

              <b>Directory=</b>
                     Directory to store the archive data.

              <b>Events</b> Archive Events. If not specified and PurgeEventAfter is set all event data removed will  be
                     lost permanently.

              <b>Jobs</b>   Archive  Jobs.  If not specified and PurgeJobAfter is set all job data removed will be lost
                     permanently.

              <b>PurgeEventAfter=</b>
                     Purge cluster event records older than time stated in months. If you want  to  purge  on  a
                     shorter  time  period  you can include hours, or days behind the numeric value to get those
                     more frequent purges. (e.g. a value of '12hours'  would  purge  everything  older  than  12
                     hours.)

              <b>PurgeJobAfter=</b>
                     Purge  job records older than time stated in months. If you want to purge on a shorter time
                     period you can include hours, or days behind the numeric value to get those  more  frequent
                     purges. (e.g. a value of '12hours' would purge everything older than 12 hours.)

              <b>PurgeStepAfter=</b>
                     Purge step records older than time stated in months. If you want to purge on a shorter time
                     period  you  can include hours, or days behind the numeric value to get those more frequent
                     purges. (e.g. a value of '12hours' would purge everything older than 12 hours.)

              <b>PurgeSuspendAfter=</b>
                     Purge job suspend records older than time stated in months. If  you  want  to  purge  on  a
                     shorter  time  period  you can include hours, or days behind the numeric value to get those
                     more frequent purges. (e.g. a value of '12hours'  would  purge  everything  older  than  12
                     hours.)

              <b>Script=</b>
                     Run this script instead of the generic form of archive to flat files.

              <b>Steps</b>  Archive  Steps.  If  not  specified and PurgeStepAfter is set all step data removed will be
                     lost permanently.

              <b>Suspend</b>
                     Archive Suspend Data. If not specified  and  PurgeSuspendAfter  is  set  all  suspend  data
                     removed will be lost permanently.

   <b>archive</b> <b>load</b>
       Load  in  to  the  database  previously archived data. The archive file will not be loaded if the records
       already exist in the database - therefore, trying to load an archive file more than once will  result  in
       an error. When this data is again archived and purged from the database, if the old archive file is still
       in  the directory ArchiveDir, a new archive file will be created (see ArchiveDir in the slurmdbd.conf man
       page), so the old file will not be overwritten and these files will have duplicate records.

       Archive files from the current or any prior Slurm release may be loaded through <b>archive</b> <b>load</b>.

              <b>File=</b>  File to load into database. The specified file must exist on the slurmdbd  host,  which  is
                     not necessarily the machine running the command.

              <b>Insert=</b>
                     SQL to insert directly into the database. This should be used very cautiously since this is
                     writing your sql into the database.

</pre><h4><b>PERFORMANCE</b></h4><pre>
       Executing  <b>sacctmgr</b>  sends  a  remote  procedure call to <b>slurmdbd</b>. If enough calls from <b>sacctmgr</b> or other
       Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to the <b>slurmdbd</b> daemon come in  at  once,  it  can
       result in a degradation of performance of the <b>slurmdbd</b> daemon, possibly resulting in a denial of service.

       Do  not  run  <b>sacctmgr</b>  or  other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to <b>slurmdbd</b> from
       loops in shell scripts or other programs.  Ensure that programs limit calls to <b>sacctmgr</b>  to  the  minimum
       necessary for the information you are trying to gather.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Some <b>sacctmgr</b> options may be set via environment variables. These environment variables, along with their
       corresponding  options,  are  listed  below.   (Note:  Command  line  options  will always override these
       settings.)

       <b>SLURM_CONF</b>          The location of the Slurm configuration file.

       <b>SLURM_DEBUG_FLAGS</b>   Specify debug flags for sacctmgr to use. See DebugFlags in the <b><a href="../man5/slurm.conf.5.html">slurm.conf</a></b>(5) man page
                           for a full list of flags. The environment variable takes precedence over the  setting
                           in the slurm.conf.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>NOTE</b>:  There  is  an  order  to  set up accounting associations.  You must define clusters before you add
       accounts and you must add accounts before you can add users.

       $ sacctmgr create cluster tux
       $ sacctmgr create account name=science fairshare=50
       $ sacctmgr create account name=chemistry parent=science fairshare=30
       $ sacctmgr create account name=physics parent=science fairshare=20
       $ sacctmgr create user name=adam cluster=tux account=physics fairshare=10
       $ sacctmgr delete user name=adam cluster=tux account=physics
       $ sacctmgr delete user name=adam cluster=tux account=science partition=\"\"
       $ sacctmgr delete account name=physics cluster=tux
       $ sacctmgr modify user where name=adam cluster=tux account=physics set maxjobs=2 maxwall=30:00
       $ sacctmgr add user brian account=chemistry
       $ sacctmgr list associations cluster=tux format=Account,Cluster,User,Fairshare tree withd
       $ sacctmgr list transactions Action="Add Users" Start=11/03-10:30:00 format=Where,Time
       $ sacctmgr dump cluster=tux file=tux_data_file
       $ sacctmgr load tux_data_file

       A user's account can not be changed directly. A new association needs to be created for the user with the
       new account. Then the association with the old account can be deleted.

       When modifying an object placing the key words 'set' and the optional  'where'  is  critical  to  perform
       correctly  below are examples to produce correct results. As a rule of thumb anything you put in front of
       the set will be used as a quantifier. If you want to put a quantifier after the key word 'set' you should
       use the key word 'where'. The following is wrong:

       $ sacctmgr modify user name=adam set fairshare=10 cluster=tux

       This will produce an error as the above line reads modify user adam  set  fairshare=10  and  cluster=tux.
       Either of the following is correct:

       $ sacctmgr modify user name=adam cluster=tux set fairshare=10
       $ sacctmgr modify user name=adam set fairshare=10 where cluster=tux

       When  changing  qos  for  something  only  use the '=' operator when wanting to explicitly set the qos to
       something. In most cases you will want to use the '+=' or '-=' operator to either add to or  remove  from
       the existing qos already in place.

       If  a  user  already  has  qos  of  normal,standby  for  a parent or it was explicitly set you should use
       qos+=expedite to add this to the list in this fashion.

       If you are looking to only add the qos expedite to only a certain account and or cluster you can do  that
       by specifying them in the sacctmgr line.

       $ sacctmgr modify user name=adam set qos+=expedite

       or

       $ sacctmgr modify user name=adam acct=this cluster=tux set qos+=expedite

       Let's give an example how to add QOS to user accounts.  List all available QOSs in the cluster.

       $ sacctmgr show qos format=name
              Name
         ---------
            normal
          expedite

       List all the associations in the cluster.

       $ sacctmgr show assoc format=cluster,account,qos
          Cluster     Account                  QOS
         --------  ---------- --------------------
            zebra        root               normal
            zebra        root               normal
            zebra           g               normal
            zebra          g1               normal

       Add  the  QOS expedite to account G1 and display the result.  Using the operator += the QOS will be added
       together with the  existing QOS to this account.

       $ sacctmgr modify account name=g1 set qos+=expedite
       $ sacctmgr show assoc format=cluster,account,qos
          Cluster     Account                  QOS
         --------  ---------- --------------------
            zebra        root               normal
            zebra        root               normal
            zebra           g               normal
            zebra          g1      expedite,normal

       Now set the QOS expedite as the only QOS for the account G and display the result. Using the  operator  =
       that expedite is the only usable QOS by account G

       $ sacctmgr modify account name=G set qos=expedite
       $ sacctmgr show assoc format=cluster,account,qos
          Cluster     Account                  QOS
         --------  ---------- --------------------
            zebra        root               normal
            zebra        root               normal

            zebra          g1      expedite,normal

       If  a  new  account  is  added  under the account G it will inherit the QOS expedite and it will not have
       access to QOS normal.

       $ sacctmgr add account banana parent=G
       $ sacctmgr show assoc format=cluster,account,qos
          Cluster     Account                  QOS
         --------  ---------- --------------------
            zebra        root               normal
            zebra        root               normal
            zebra           g             expedite
            zebra      banana             expedite
            zebra          g1      expedite,normal
