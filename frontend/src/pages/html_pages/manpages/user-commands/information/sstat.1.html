</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sstat - Display the status information of a running job/step.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sstat</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Status information for running jobs invoked with Slurm.

       The  <b>sstat</b>  command  displays  job  status  information  for  your  analysis.  The <b>sstat</b> command displays
       information pertaining to CPU, Task, Node, Resident Set Size (RSS) and  Virtual  Memory  (VM).   You  can
       tailor the output with the use of the <b>--fields=</b> option to specify the fields to be shown.

       For the root user, the <b>sstat</b> command displays job status data for any job running on the system.

       For the non-root user, the <b>sstat</b> output is limited to the user's jobs.

       <b>NOTE</b>: The <b>sstat</b> command requires that the <b>jobacct_gather</b> plugin be installed and operational.

       <b>NOTE</b>:   Availability   of   metrics   rely   on   the   <b>jobacct_gather</b>   plugin  used.  For  example  the
       jobacct_gather/cgroup in combination with cgroup/v2 does  not  provide  Virtual  Memory  metrics  due  to
       limitations in the kernel cgroups interfaces and will show a 0 for the related fields.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b>, <b>--allsteps</b>
              Print all steps for the given job(s) when no step is specified.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--format</b>, <b>--fields</b>
              Comma separated list of fields.  (use '--helpformat' for a list of available fields).

              <b>NOTE</b>:  When using the format option for listing various fields you can put a %NUMBER afterwards to
              specify how many characters should be printed.

              i.e. format=name%30 will print 30 characters of field name right justified. A -30  will  print  30
              characters left justified.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Displays a general help message.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--helpformat</b>
              Print a list of fields that can be specified with the '--format' option.

       <b>-j</b>, <b>--jobs</b>
              Format  is  &lt;job(.step)&gt;.  Stat this job step or comma-separated list of job steps. This option is
              required. The step portion will default to the lowest  numbered  (not  batch,  extern,  etc)  step
              running  if  not  specified,  unless  the  --allsteps flag is set where not specifying a step will
              result in all running steps to be displayed.   <b>NOTE</b>:  A  step  id  of  'batch'  will  display  the
              information  about the batch step.  <b>NOTE</b>: A step id of 'extern' will display the information about
              the extern step. This step is only available when using PrologFlags=contain

       <b>--noconvert</b>
              Don't convert units from their original type (e.g. 2048M won't be converted to 2G).

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--noheader</b>
              No heading will be added to the output. The default action is to display a header.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--parsable</b>
              output will be '|' delimited with a '|' at the end

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--parsable2</b>
              output will be '|' delimited without a '|' at the end

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--pidformat</b>
              Predefined format to list the pids running for each job step.  (JobId,Nodes,Pids)

       <b>--usage</b>
              Display a command usage summary.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Primarily for debugging purposes, report the state of various variables during processing.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Print version.

   <b>Job</b> <b>Status</b> <b>Fields</b>
       Descriptions of each field option can be found below.  Note that  the  Ave*,  Max*  and  Min*  accounting
       fields  look  at  the  values  for all the tasks of each step in a job and return the average, maximum or
       minimum values of the task for that job step. For example, for MaxRSS, the returned value is the  maximum
       memory consumption seen by one of the tasks of the step, and MaxRSSTask shows which task it is.

</pre><h4><b>PERFORMANCE</b></h4><pre>
       Executing <b>sstat</b> sends a remote procedure call to <b>slurmctld</b>. If enough calls from  <b>sstat</b>  or  other  Slurm
       client  commands  that send remote procedure calls to the <b>slurmctld</b> daemon come in at once, it can result
       in a degradation of performance of the <b>slurmctld</b> daemon, possibly resulting in a denial of service.

       Do not run <b>sstat</b> or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to <b>slurmctld</b> from  loops
       in  shell  scripts  or other programs. Ensure that programs limit calls to <b>sstat</b> to the minimum necessary
       for the information you are trying to gather.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Some <b>sstat</b> options may be set via environment variables. These environment variables,  along  with  their
       corresponding  options,  are  listed  below.   (Note:  Command  line  options  will always override these
       settings.)

       <b>SLURM_CONF</b>          The location of the Slurm configuration file.

       <b>SLURM_DEBUG_FLAGS</b>   Specify debug flags for sstat to use. See DebugFlags in the  <b><a href="../man5/slurm.conf.5.html">slurm.conf</a></b>(5)  man  page
                           for  a full list of flags. The environment variable takes precedence over the setting
                           in the slurm.conf.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Display job step information for job 11 with the specified fields:

              $ sstat --format=AveCPU,AvePages,AveRSS,AveVMSize,JobID -j 11
              25:02.000  0K         1.37M      5.93M      9.0

       Display job step information for job 11 with the specified fields in a parsable format:

              $ sstat -p --format=AveCPU,AvePages,AveRSS,AveVMSize,JobID -j 11
              25:02.000|0K|1.37M|5.93M|9.0|
