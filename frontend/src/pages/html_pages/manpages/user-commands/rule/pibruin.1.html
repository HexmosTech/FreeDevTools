       pibruin - Classification Rule Insert Utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pibruin</b> [<u>options</u>] [&lt;<u>rules</u>] file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Read  a set of classification rules from stdin and insert them directly into a PIB file.  This program is
       an alternative to program <b>int6krule</b> and a companion to program <b>pibrump</b>.  Although it is possible to  <b>ruin</b>
       a PIB using this command, the name is short for "<b>ru</b>le <b>in</b>sert".

       Atheros  recommends  that  users  validate  all  classification  rule  sets used with this program before
       inserting them into an operational PIB.  Individual rules may be syntactically valid but they  can  still
       be technically invalid or conflict with other.  This program does not perform any technical or cross-rule
       validation what-so-ever.

       Cross-rule  validation  is  normally  done  by  runtime  firmware  when a rule arrives in a VS_CLASSIFIER
       management message.  This validation prevents the insertion of meaningless or conflicting rules into  the
       PIB.   It may be possible to commit a PIB containing mis-configured classification rule sets thus causing
       the device to lockup or misbehave on reboot.

       One recommended method of rule set validation is to program a device with individual rules using  program
       <b>int6krule</b>  then read the PIB and extract the rule set with program <b>pibrump</b>.  The rule set should be valid
       at that point.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the <b>AMP</b> man page for an overview and
       installation instructions.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -<b>o</b> <u>offset</u>
              Specify an alternative PIB offset when inserting the classifier block.  Customers should  not  use
              this  option.   It  is  provided  to  account for firmware changes that might occur in the future.
              Improper use of this option can render a PIB file unrecoverable.

       -<b>q</b>     Suppresses progress messages.

       -<b>v</b>     Print additional information on stdout.

       -<b>?</b>,--<b>help</b>
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence  over  other  options  on  the
              command line.

       -<b>!</b>,--<b>version</b>
              Print  program  version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on
              the command line.  Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so  that
              they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>file</u>   The  name of a valid Atheros runtime parameter file.  The file is modified by this program only if
              the classification rule file is syntactically correct.  See  the  <b>DISCLAIMER</b>  section  below.   No
              backup  file  is  created.   By convention, runtime parameter files have a <b>.pib</b> extention but this
              program does not enforce that convention.  The file must exist and be a valid PIB file  or  errors
              will occur.

       <u>rules</u>  The  name  of a valid classifier rule file.  The file is not modified by this program.  Classifier
              rule files are standard ASCII text and may be created manually using a normal text editor  or  may
              be  generated automatically using another program such as <b>pubrump</b>.  By convention, classifier rule
              files have a .<b>.qos</b> extension but this program does not enforce that convention.  If this  file  is
              omitted then rules are read from from the console, one rule per line.

</pre><h4><b>DISCLAIMER</b></h4><pre>
       PIB  file  structure  and content is proprietary to Qualcomm Atheros, Ocala FL USA.  Consequently, public
       information is not available.  Qualcomm Atheros reserves the  right  to  change  the  file  structure  or
       content in future firmware releases without any obligation to notify or compensate users of this program.

       This program is provided for convenience only.  It is possible to insert meaningless or confilicting rule
       sets  into  a  PIB  with this program because approved cross-rule validation is not performed.  Incorrect
       application of perfectly valid rules may render a device ineffective or unusable on a powerline  network.
       Program  users are responsible for ensuring that their rule sets are verified by other means before using
       this program to insert them into an operational PIB file.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following is an example set of classification rules stored in file <b>rules.txt</b>.  The  file  contains  5
       rules,  one  rule  per  line.   The  rules  are  identical  to command line arguments expected by program
       <b>int6krule</b> and one could type them, one at a time, into <b>int6krule</b> and wait for the device  to  reset  each
       time.   Alternately,  we  could  insert  all the rules directly into a PIB file at once then download and
       commit the PIB, resulting in only one reset.

          # cat rules.txt
          Cap1 any VLANID is 20 add perm
          DropRX any VLANID is 25 add perm
          StripRx any VLANID is 5 VLANID is 10 VLANID is 15 add perm
          StripRx any VLANID is 20 add perm
          Cap1 any VLANID is 5 VLANID is 10 VLANID is 15 add perm

       The following example reads file <b>rules.txt</b> from stdin and writes it  into  file  <b>def.pib</b>.   This  may  be
       usefule  if  one  wanted  to  distribute  a  known  set of rules to other users or wanted to test various
       combinations of rules.  Sincd rule files are

          # pibruin &lt; rules.txt

       The next example reads classification rules directly from file <b>abc.pib</b> using program <b>pibrump</b>  and  writes
       them  directly  into file <b>def.pbi</b> using program <b>pibruin</b>.  This is one means of transfering classification
       rules from one PIB to another.
