</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Virt-builder is a tool for quickly building new virtual machines.  You can build a variety of VMs for
       local or cloud use, usually within a few minutes or less.  Virt-builder also has many ways to customize
       these VMs.  Everything is run from the command line and nothing requires root privileges, so automation
       and scripting is simple.

       Note that virt-builder does not install guests from scratch.  It takes cleanly prepared, digitally signed
       OS templates and customizes them.  This approach is used because it is much faster, but if you need to do
       fresh installs you may want to look at <b><a href="../man1/virt-install.1.html">virt-install</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/oz-install.1.html">oz-install</a></b>(1).

       The easiest way to get started is by looking at the examples in the next section.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>List</b> <b>the</b> <b>virtual</b> <b>machines</b> <b>available</b>
        virt-builder --list

       will list out the operating systems available to install.  A selection of freely redistributable OSes is
       available as standard.  You can add your own too (see below).

       After choosing a guest from the list, you may want to see if there are any installation notes:

        virt-builder --notes fedora-27

   <b>Build</b> <b>a</b> <b>virtual</b> <b>machine</b>
        virt-builder fedora-27

       will build a Fedora 25 image for the same architecture as virt-builder (so running it from an i686
       installation will try to build an i686 image, if available).  This will have all default configuration
       (minimal size, no user accounts, random root password, only the bare minimum installed software, etc.).

       You <u>do</u> <u>not</u> need to run this command as root.

       The first time this runs it has to download the template over the network, but this gets cached (see
       "CACHING").

       The name of the output file is derived from the template name, so above it will be <u>fedora-27.img</u>.  You
       can change the output filename using the <u>-o</u> option:

        virt-builder fedora-27 -o mydisk.img

       You can also use the <u>-o</u> option to write to existing devices or logical volumes.

        virt-builder fedora-27 --format qcow2

       As above, but write the output in qcow2 format to <u>fedora-27.qcow2</u>.

        virt-builder fedora-27 --size 20G

       As above, but the output size will be 20 GB.  The guest OS is resized as it is copied to the output
       (automatically, using <b><a href="../man1/virt-resize.1.html">virt-resize</a></b>(1)).

        virt-builder fedora-27 --arch i686

       As above, but using an i686 template, if available.

   <b>Setting</b> <b>the</b> <b>root</b> <b>password</b>
        virt-builder fedora-27 --root-password file:/tmp/rootpw

       Create a Fedora 25 image.  The root password is taken from the file <u>/tmp/rootpw</u>.

       Note if you <u>don’t</u> set <u>--root-password</u> then the guest is given a <u>random</u> root password which is printed on
       stdout.

       You can also create user accounts.  See "USERS AND PASSWORDS" below.

   <b>Set</b> <b>the</b> <b>hostname</b>
        virt-builder fedora-27 --hostname virt.example.com

       Set the hostname to "virt.example.com".

   <b>Installing</b> <b>software</b>
       To install packages from the ordinary (guest) software repository (eg. dnf or apt):

        virt-builder fedora-27 --install "inkscape,@Xfce Desktop"

       (In Fedora, "@" is used to install groups of packages.  On Debian you would install a meta-package
       instead.)

       To update the installed packages to the latest version:

        virt-builder debian-7 --update

   <b>Customizing</b> <b>the</b> <b>installation</b>
       There are many options that let you customize the installation.  These include: <u>--run</u>/<u>--run-command</u>,
       which run a shell script or command while the disk image is being generated and lets you add or edit
       files that go into the disk image.  <u>--firstboot</u>/<u>--firstboot-command</u>, which let you add scripts/commands
       that are run the first time the guest boots.  <u>--edit</u> to edit files.  <u>--upload</u> to upload files.

       For example:

        cat &lt;&lt;'EOF' &gt; /tmp/dnf-update.sh
        dnf -y --best update
        EOF

        virt-builder fedora-27 --firstboot /tmp/dnf-update.sh

       or simply:

        virt-builder fedora-27 --firstboot-command 'dnf -y --best update'

       which makes the <b><a href="../man8/dnf.8.html">dnf</a></b>(8) "update" command run once the first time the guest boots.

       Or:

        virt-builder fedora-27 \
          --edit '/etc/dnf/dnf.conf:
                    s/gpgcheck=1/gpgcheck=0/'

       which edits <u>/etc/dnf/dnf.conf</u> inside the disk image (during disk image creation, long before boot).

       You can combine these options, and have multiple options of all types.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--help</b>
           Display help.

       <b>--arch</b> ARCHITECTURE
           Use  the specified architecture for the output image.  This means there must be sources providing the
           requested template for the requested architecture.

           See also "ARCHITECTURE".

       <b>--attach</b> ISOFILE
           During the customization phase, the given disk is attached to the libguestfs appliance.  This is used
           to provide extra software repositories or other data for customization.

           You probably want to ensure the volume(s) or filesystems in the attached disks are labelled  (or  use
           an ISO volume name) so that you can mount them by label in your run-scripts:

            mkdir /tmp/mount
            mount LABEL=EXTRA /tmp/mount

           You can have multiple <u>--attach</u> options, and the format can be any disk format (not just an ISO).

           See  also:  <u>--run</u>,  "Installing  packages  at  build  time  from  a side repository", <b><a href="../man1/genisoimage.1.html">genisoimage</a></b>(1),
           <b><a href="../man1/virt-make-fs.1.html">virt-make-fs</a></b>(1).

       <b>--attach-format</b> FORMAT
           Specify the disk format for the next <u>--attach</u> option.  The "FORMAT" is usually "raw" or "qcow2".  Use
           "raw" for ISOs.

       <b>--cache</b> DIR
       <b>--no-cache</b>
           <u>--cache</u> DIR sets the directory to use/check for cached template  files.   If  not  set,  defaults  to
           either <u>$XDG_CACHE_HOME/virt-builder/</u> or <u>$HOME/.cache/virt-builder/</u>.

           <u>--no-cache</u> disables template caching.

       <b>--cache-all-templates</b>
           Download all templates to the cache and then exit.  See "CACHING".

           Note  this  doesn't  cache  everything.   More  templates might be uploaded.  Also this doesn't cache
           packages (the <u>--install</u>, <u>--update</u> options).

       <b>--check-signature</b>
       <b>--no-check-signature</b>
           Check/don’t check the digital signature of the OS template.  The default is to  check  the  signature
           and exit if it is not correct.  Using <u>--no-check-signature</u> bypasses this check.

           See also <u>--fingerprint</u>.

       <b>--colors</b>
       <b>--colours</b>
           Use  ANSI  colour sequences to colourize messages.  This is the default when the output is a tty.  If
           the output of the program is redirected to a file, ANSI colour sequences are disabled unless you  use
           this option.

       <b>--curl</b> CURL
           Specify  an  alternate  <b><a href="../man1/curl.1.html">curl</a></b>(1) binary.  You can also use this to add curl parameters, for example to
           disable https certificate checks:

            virt-builder --curl "curl --insecure" [...]

       <b>--delete-cache</b>
           Delete the template cache.  See "CACHING".

       <b>--no-delete-on-failure</b>
           Don’t delete the output file on failure to build.  You can use this to debug failures to run scripts.
           See "DEBUGGING BUILDS" for ways to debug images.

           The default is to delete the output file if virt-builder fails (or, for example, some script that  it
           runs fails).

       <b>--fingerprint</b> 'AAAA BBBB ...'
           Check  that  the  index  and  templates  are  signed  by  the  key  with the given fingerprint.  (The
           fingerprint is a long string, usually written as 10 groups of 4 hexadecimal digits).

           You can give this option multiple times.  If you have multiple source URLs, then you can have  either
           no  fingerprint,  one  fingerprint  or  multiple  fingerprints.  If you have multiple, then each must
           correspond 1-1 with a source URL.

       <b>--format</b> qcow2
       <b>--format</b> raw
           For ordinary builds, this selects the output format.  The default is <u>raw</u>.

           With <u>--get-kernel</u> this specifies the input format.

           To create an old-style qcow2 file (for compatibility with RHEL 6 or  very  old  qemu  &lt;  1.1),  after
           running virt-builder, use this command:

            qemu-img amend -f qcow2 -o compat=0.10 output.qcow2

       <b>--get-kernel</b> IMAGE
           This  option  extracts the kernel and initramfs from a previously built disk image called "IMAGE" (in
           fact it works for any VM disk image, not just ones built using virt-builder).

           Note this method is <b>deprecated</b>: there is a separate tool for this, <b><a href="../man1/virt-get-kernel.1.html">virt-get-kernel</a></b>(1), which has more
           options for the file extraction.

           The kernel and initramfs are written to the current directory, unless you also specify  the  <u>--output</u>
           "outputdir" <b>directory</b> name.

           The  format  of  the disk image is automatically detected unless you specify it by using the <u>--format</u>
           option.

           In the case where the guest contains multiple kernels, the one with the  highest  version  number  is
           chosen.   To  extract arbitrary kernels from the disk image, see <b><a href="../man1/guestfish.1.html">guestfish</a></b>(1).  To extract the entire
           <u><a href="file:/boot">/boot</a></u> directory of a guest, see <b><a href="../man1/virt-copy-out.1.html">virt-copy-out</a></b>(1).

       <b>--gpg</b> GPG
           Specify an alternate <b><a href="../man1/gpg.1.html">gpg</a></b>(1) (GNU Privacy Guard) binary.  By default  virt-builder  looks  for  either
           "gpg2" or "gpg" in the $PATH.

           You can also use this to add gpg parameters, for example to specify an alternate home directory:

            virt-builder --gpg "gpg --homedir <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>" [...]

       <b>-l</b> [os-version]
       <b>--list</b> [os-version]
       <b>--list</b> <b>--list-format</b> format [os-version]
       <b>--list</b> <b>--long</b> [os-version]
           List all the available templates if no guest is specified, or only for the specified one.

           It is possible to choose with <u>--list-format</u> the output format for the list templates:

           <b>short</b>
               The default format, prints only the template identifier and, next to it, its short description.

           <b>long</b>
               Prints  a  textual list with the details of the available sources, followed by the details of the
               available templates.

           <b>json</b>
               Prints a JSON object with the details of the available sources and the details of  the  available
               templates.

               The  "version"  key  in  the main object represents the "compatibility version", and it is bumped
               every time the resulting JSON output is incompatible with the previous versions (for example  the
               structure has changed, or non-optional keys are no more present).

           <u>--long</u> is a shorthand for the "long" format.

           See also: <u>--source</u>, <u>--notes</u>, "SOURCES OF TEMPLATES".

       <b>--machine-readable</b>
       <b>--machine-readable</b>=format
           This  option  is  used  to make the output more machine friendly when being parsed by other programs.
           See "MACHINE READABLE OUTPUT" below.

       <b>-m</b> MB
       <b>--memsize</b> MB
           Change the amount of memory allocated to <u>--run</u> scripts.  Increase this if you find that <u>--run</u> scripts
           or the <u>--install</u> option are running out of memory.

           The default can be found with this command:

            guestfish get-memsize

       <b>--network</b>
       <b>--no-network</b>
           Enable or disable network access from the guest during the installation.

           Enabled is the default.  Use <u>--no-network</u> to disable access.

           The network only allows outgoing connections and has  other  minor  limitations.   See  "NETWORK"  in
           <b><a href="../man1/virt-rescue.1.html">virt-rescue</a></b>(1).

           If you use <u>--no-network</u> then certain other options such as <u>--install</u> will not work.

           This  does  not affect whether the guest can access the network once it has been booted, because that
           is controlled by your hypervisor or cloud environment and has nothing to do with virt-builder.

           Generally speaking you should <u>not</u> use <u>--no-network</u>.  But here are some reasons why you might want to:

           1.  Because the libguestfs backend that you are using doesn't support the network.   (See:  "BACKEND"
               in <b><a href="../man3/guestfs.3.html">guestfs</a></b>(3)).

           2.  Any software you need to install comes from an attached ISO, so you don't need the network.

           3.  You don’t want untrusted guest code trying to access your host network when running virt-builder.
               This  is particularly an issue when you don't trust the source of the operating system templates.
               (See "SECURITY" below).

           4.  You don’t have a host network (eg. in secure/restricted environments).

       <b>--no-sync</b>
           Do not sync the output file on exit.

           Virt-builder "fsync"s the output file or disk image when it exits.

           The reason is that qemu/KVM’s default caching mode is "none" or "directsync", both  of  which  bypass
           the  host  page cache.  Therefore these would not work correctly if you immediately started the guest
           after running virt-builder - they would not see the complete output file.  (Note that you should  not
           use these caching modes - they are fundamentally broken for this and other reasons.)

           If you are not using these broken caching modes, you can use <u>--no-sync</u> to avoid this unnecessary sync
           and gain considerable extra performance.

       <b>--notes</b> os-version
           List any notes associated with this guest, then exit (this does not do the install).

       <b>-o</b> filename
       <b>--output</b> filename
           Write  the  output  to  <u>filename</u>.   If  you  don’t  specify  this option, then the output filename is
           generated by taking the "os-version" string and adding ".img" (for raw format) or ".qcow2" (for qcow2
           format).

           Note that the output filename could be a device, partition or logical volume.

           When used with <u>--get-kernel</u>, this option specifies the output directory.

       <b>--print-cache</b>
           Print information about the template cache.  See "CACHING".

       <b>-q</b>
       <b>--quiet</b>
           Don’t print ordinary progress messages.

       <b>--size</b> SIZE
           Select the size of the output disk, where the size can be specified using common names such as  "32G"
           (32 gigabytes) etc.

           Virt-builder will resize filesystems inside the disk image automatically.

           If the size is not specified, then one of two things happens.  If the output is a file, then the size
           is  the same as the template.  If the output is a device, partition, etc then the size of that device
           is used.

           To  specify  size  in  bytes,  the  number  must  be  followed  by  the  lowercase  letter   <u>b</u>,   eg:
           "--size 10737418240b".

       <b>--smp</b> N
           Enable N ≥ 2 virtual CPUs for <u>--run</u> scripts to use.

       <b>--source</b> URL
           Set the source URL to look for indexes.

           You can give this option multiple times to specify multiple sources.

           See also "SOURCES OF TEMPLATES" below.

           Note  that you should not point <u>--source</u> to sources that you don’t trust (unless the source is signed
           by someone you do trust).  See also the <u>--no-network</u> option.

       <b>--no-warn-if-partition</b>
           Do not emit a warning if the output device is a partition.  This warning avoids a common  user  error
           when  writing  to  a  USB  key  or external drive, when you should normally write to the whole device
           (<u>--output</u> <u>/dev/sdX</u>), not to a partition on the  device  (<u>--output</u> <u>/dev/sdX1</u>).   Use  this  option  to
           <u>suppress</u> this warning.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--verbose</b>
           Enable debug messages and/or produce verbose output.

           When reporting bugs, use this option and attach the complete output to your bug report.

       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
           Display version number and exit.

       <b>--wrap</b>
           Wrap error, warning, and informative messages.  This is the default when the output is a tty.  If the
           output of the program is redirected to a file, wrapping is disabled unless you use this option.

       <b>-x</b>  Enable tracing of libguestfs API calls.

   <b>Customization</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>--append-line</b> FILE:LINE
           Append  a  single  line of text to the "FILE".  If the file does not already end with a newline, then
           one is added before the appended line.  Also a newline is added to  the  end  of  the  "LINE"  string
           automatically.

           For example (assuming ordinary shell quoting) this command:

            --append-line '<a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a>:10.0.0.1 foo'

           will add either "10.0.0.1 foo⏎" or "⏎10.0.0.1 foo⏎" to the file, the latter only if the existing file
           does not already end with a newline.

           "⏎"  represents a newline character, which is guessed by looking at the existing content of the file,
           so this command does the right thing for files using Unix or Windows line endings.  It also works for
           empty or non-existent files.

           To insert several lines, use the same option several times:

            --append-line '<a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a>:10.0.0.1 foo'
            --append-line '<a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a>:10.0.0.2 bar'

           To insert a blank line before the appended line, do:

            --append-line '<a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a>:'
            --append-line '<a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a>:10.0.0.1 foo'

       <b>--chmod</b> PERMISSIONS:FILE
           Change the permissions of "FILE" to "PERMISSIONS".

           <u>Note</u>: "PERMISSIONS" by default would be decimal, unless you prefix it with 0 to get  octal,  ie.  use
           0700 not 700.

       <b>--chown</b> UID:GID:PATH
           Change the owner user and group ID of a file or directory in the guest.  Note:

           •   Only  numeric  UIDs  and GIDs will work, and these may not be the same inside the guest as on the
               host.

           •   This will not work with Windows guests.

           For example:

            virt-customize --chown '0:0:/var/log/audit.log'

           See also: <u>--upload</u>.

       <b>--commands-from-file</b> FILENAME
           Read the customize commands from a file, one (and its arguments) each line.

           Each line contains a single customization command and its arguments, for example:

            delete /some/file
            install some-package
            password some-user:password:its-new-password

           Empty lines are ignored, and  lines  starting  with  "#"  are  comments  and  are  ignored  as  well.
           Furthermore,  arguments can be spread across multiple lines, by adding a "\" (continuation character)
           at the of a line, for example

            edit /some/file:\
              s/^OPT=.*/OPT=ok/

           The commands are handled in the same order as they are in the file, as  if  they  were  specified  as
           <u>--delete</u> <u>/some/file</u> on the command line.

       <b>--copy</b> SOURCE:DEST
           Copy files or directories recursively inside the guest.

           Wildcards cannot be used.

       <b>--copy-in</b> LOCALPATH:REMOTEDIR
           Copy  local  files  or  directories  recursively  into  the disk image, placing them in the directory
           "REMOTEDIR" (which must exist).

           Wildcards cannot be used.

       <b>--delete</b> PATH
           Delete a file from the guest.  Or delete a directory (and all its contents, recursively).

           You can use shell glob characters in the specified path.  Be careful to escape glob  characters  from
           the host shell, if that is required.  For example:

            virt-customize --delete '<a href="file:/var/log/">/var/log/</a>*.log'.

           See also: <u>--upload</u>, <u>--scrub</u>.

       <b>--edit</b> FILE:EXPR
           Edit "FILE" using the Perl expression "EXPR".

           Be careful to properly quote the expression to prevent it from being altered by the shell.

           Note that this option is only available when Perl 5 is installed.

           See "NON-INTERACTIVE EDITING" in <b><a href="../man1/virt-edit.1.html">virt-edit</a></b>(1).

       <b>--firstboot</b> SCRIPT
           Install  "SCRIPT"  inside the guest, so that when the guest first boots up, the script runs (as root,
           late in the boot process).

           The script is automatically chmod +x after installation in the guest.

           The alternative version <u>--firstboot-command</u> is the same, but it conveniently wraps the command up  in
           a single line script for you.

           You  can  have  multiple  <u>--firstboot</u>  options.   They  run in the same order that they appear on the
           command line.

           Please take a look at "FIRST BOOT SCRIPTS" for more information and  caveats  about  the  first  boot
           scripts.

           See also <u>--run</u>.

       <b>--firstboot-command</b> 'CMD+ARGS'
           Run command (and arguments) inside the guest when the guest first boots up (as root, late in the boot
           process).

           You  can  have  multiple  <u>--firstboot</u>  options.   They  run in the same order that they appear on the
           command line.

           Please take a look at "FIRST BOOT SCRIPTS" for more information and  caveats  about  the  first  boot
           scripts.

           See also <u>--run</u>.

       <b>--firstboot-install</b> PKG,PKG..
           Install  the named packages (a comma-separated list).  These are installed when the guest first boots
           using the guest’s package manager (eg. apt, yum, etc.) and the guest’s network connection.

           For an overview on the different ways to install packages, see "INSTALLING PACKAGES".

       <b>--hostname</b> HOSTNAME
           Set the hostname of the guest to "HOSTNAME".  You can use a dotted hostname.domainname (FQDN) if  you
           want.

       <b>--inject-qemu-ga</b> METHOD
           Inject  the  QEMU Guest Agent into a Windows guest.  The guest agent communicates with qemu through a
           socket in order to provide enhanced  features  (see  <b><a href="../man8/qemu-ga.8.html">qemu-ga</a></b>(8)).   This  operation  also  injects  a
           firstboot script so that the Guest Agent is installed when the guest boots.

           The parameter is the same as used by the <u>--inject-virtio-win</u> operation.

           Note  that  to  do  a full conversion of a Windows guest from a foreign hypervisor like VMware (which
           involves many other operations) you should use the <b><a href="../man1/virt-v2v.1.html">virt-v2v</a></b>(1) tool instead of this.

       <b>--inject-virtio-win</b> METHOD
           Inject virtio-win drivers into a  Windows  guest.   These  drivers  add  virtio  accelerated  drivers
           suitable  when running on top of a hypervisor that supports virtio (such as qemu/KVM).  The operation
           also adjusts the Windows Registry so that the drivers are installed when the guest boots.

           The parameter can be one of:

           ISO The    path    to    the    ISO    image    containing    the     virtio-win     drivers     (eg.
               <u>/usr/share/virtio-win/virtio-win.iso</u>).

           DIR The directory containing the unpacked virtio-win drivers (eg. <u>/usr/share/virtio-win</u>).

           <b>"osinfo"</b>
               The  literal  string  "osinfo"  means  to use the libosinfo database to locate the drivers.  (See
               <b><a href="../man1/osinfo-query.1.html">osinfo-query</a></b>(1).

           Note that to do a full conversion of a Windows guest from a foreign  hypervisor  like  VMware  (which
           involves many other operations) you should use the <b><a href="../man1/virt-v2v.1.html">virt-v2v</a></b>(1) tool instead of this.

       <b>--install</b> PKG,PKG..
           Install  the  named  packages  (a  comma-separated list).  These are installed during the image build
           using the guest’s package manager (eg. apt, yum, etc.) and the host’s network connection.

           For an overview on the different ways to install packages, see "INSTALLING PACKAGES".

           See also <u>--update</u>, <u>--uninstall</u>.

       <b>--link</b> TARGET:LINK[:LINK..]
           Create symbolic link(s) in the guest, starting at "LINK" and pointing at "TARGET".

       <b>--mkdir</b> DIR
           Create a directory in the guest.

           This uses "mkdir -p" so any intermediate directories are created, and it also works if the  directory
           already exists.

       <b>--move</b> SOURCE:DEST
           Move files or directories inside the guest.

           Wildcards cannot be used.

       <b>--no-logfile</b>
           Scrub "builder.log" (log file from build commands) from the image after building is complete.  If you
           don't want to reveal precisely how the image was built, use this option.

           See also: "LOG FILE".

       <b>--no-selinux-relabel</b>
           Do not attempt to correct the SELinux labels of files in the guest.

           In such guests that support SELinux, customization automatically relabels files so that they have the
           correct  SELinux  label.   (The  relabeling  is  performed  immediately,  but if the operation fails,
           customization will instead touch <u>/.autorelabel</u> on the image to schedule a relabel operation  for  the
           next time the image boots.)  This option disables the automatic relabeling.

           The option is a no-op for guests that do not support SELinux.

       <b>--password</b> USER:SELECTOR
           Set the password for "USER".  (Note this option does <u>not</u> create the user account).

           See  "USERS  AND  PASSWORDS"  for  the  format  of  the "SELECTOR" field, and also how to set up user
           accounts.

       <b>--password-crypto</b> md5|sha256|sha512
           When the virt tools change or set a password in the guest, this option sets the  password  encryption
           of that password to "md5", "sha256" or "sha512".

           "sha256" and "sha512" require glibc ≥ 2.7 (check <b><a href="../man3/crypt.3.html">crypt</a></b>(3) inside the guest).

           "md5"  will  work  with  relatively  old  Linux guests (eg. RHEL 3), but is not secure against modern
           attacks.

           The default is "sha512" unless libguestfs detects an old guest that didn't have support for  SHA-512,
           in which case it will use "md5".  You can override libguestfs by specifying this option.

           Note  this does not change the default password encryption used by the guest when you create new user
           accounts inside the guest.  If you want to do that, then you should use the <u>--edit</u> option  to  modify
           "/etc/sysconfig/authconfig" (Fedora, RHEL) or "<a href="file:/etc/pam.d/common-password">/etc/pam.d/common-password</a>" (Debian, Ubuntu).

       <b>--root-password</b> SELECTOR
           Set the root password.

           See  "USERS  AND  PASSWORDS"  for  the  format  of  the "SELECTOR" field, and also how to set up user
           accounts.

           Note: In virt-builder, if you <u>don't</u> set <u>--root-password</u>  then  the  guest  is  given  a  <u>random</u>  root
           password.

       <b>--run</b> SCRIPT
           Run the shell script (or any program) called "SCRIPT" on the disk image.  The script runs virtualized
           inside a small appliance, chrooted into the guest filesystem.

           The script is automatically chmod +x.

           If  libguestfs supports it then a limited network connection is available but it only allows outgoing
           network connections.  You can also attach data disks (eg. ISO files) as another way to  provide  data
           (eg.  software packages) to the script without needing a network connection (<u>--attach</u>).  You can also
           upload data files (<u>--upload</u>).

           You can have multiple <u>--run</u> options.  They run in the same order that  they  appear  on  the  command
           line.

           See also: <u>--firstboot</u>, <u>--attach</u>, <u>--upload</u>.

       <b>--run-command</b> 'CMD+ARGS'
           Run  the  command  and  arguments  on  the  disk  image.  The command runs virtualized inside a small
           appliance, chrooted into the guest filesystem.

           If libguestfs supports it then a limited network connection is available but it only allows  outgoing
           network  connections.   You can also attach data disks (eg. ISO files) as another way to provide data
           (eg. software packages) to the script without needing a network connection (<u>--attach</u>).  You can  also
           upload data files (<u>--upload</u>).

           You  can  have  multiple  <u>--run-command</u>  options.  They run in the same order that they appear on the
           command line.

           See also: <u>--firstboot</u>, <u>--attach</u>, <u>--upload</u>.

       <b>--scrub</b> FILE
           Scrub a file from the guest.  This is like <u>--delete</u> except that:

           •   It scrubs the data so a guest could not recover it.

           •   It cannot delete directories, only regular files.

       <b>--selinux-relabel</b>
           This is a compatibility option that does nothing.

       <b>--sm-attach</b> SELECTOR
           Attach to a pool using "subscription-manager".

           See "SUBSCRIPTION-MANAGER" for the format of the "SELECTOR" field.

       <b>--sm-credentials</b> SELECTOR
           Set the credentials for "subscription-manager".

           See "SUBSCRIPTION-MANAGER" for the format of the "SELECTOR" field.

       <b>--sm-register</b>
           Register the guest using "subscription-manager".

           This requires credentials being set using <u>--sm-credentials</u>.

       <b>--sm-remove</b>
           Remove all the subscriptions from the guest using "subscription-manager".

       <b>--sm-unregister</b>
           Unregister the guest using "subscription-manager".

       <b>--ssh-inject</b> USER[:SELECTOR]
           Inject an ssh key so the given "USER" will be able to log in over ssh without supplying  a  password.
           The "USER" must exist already in the guest.

           See "SSH KEYS" for the format of the "SELECTOR" field.

           You can have multiple <u>--ssh-inject</u> options, for different users and also for more keys for each user.

       <b>--tar-in</b> TARFILE:REMOTEDIR
           Copy  local  files or directories from a local tar file called "TARFILE" into the disk image, placing
           them in the directory "REMOTEDIR" (which must exist).  Note that the tar file  must  be  uncompressed
           (<u>.tar.gz</u> files will not work here)

       <b>--timezone</b> TIMEZONE
           Set the default timezone of the guest to "TIMEZONE".  Use a location string like "Europe/London"

       <b>--touch</b> FILE
           This command performs a <b><a href="../man1/touch.1.html">touch</a></b>(1)-like operation on "FILE".

       <b>--truncate</b> FILE
           This command truncates "FILE" to a zero-length file. The file must exist already.

       <b>--truncate-recursive</b> PATH
           This command recursively truncates all files under "PATH" to zero-length.

       <b>--uninstall</b> PKG,PKG..
           Uninstall  the  named  packages  (a  comma-separated list).  These are removed during the image build
           using the guest’s package manager (eg. apt, yum, etc.).  Dependent  packages  may  also  need  to  be
           uninstalled to satisfy the request.

           See also <u>--install</u>, <u>--update</u>.

       <b>--update</b>
           Do  the  equivalent of "yum update", "apt-get upgrade", or whatever command is required to update the
           packages already installed in the template to their latest versions.

           See also <u>--install</u>, <u>--uninstall</u>.

       <b>--upload</b> FILE:DEST
           Upload local file "FILE" to destination "DEST" in the disk image.  File owner  and  permissions  from
           the original are preserved, so you should set them to what you want them to be in the disk image.

           "DEST" could be the final filename.  This can be used to rename the file on upload.

           If  "DEST" is a directory name (which must already exist in the guest) then the file is uploaded into
           that directory, and it keeps the same name as on the local filesystem.

           See also: <u>--mkdir</u>, <u>--delete</u>, <u>--scrub</u>.

       <b>--write</b> FILE:CONTENT
           Write "CONTENT" to "FILE".

</pre><h4><b>REFERENCE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>INSTALLING</b> <b>PACKAGES</b>
       There are several approaches to installing packages or applications in the  guest  which  have  different
       trade-offs.

       <u>Installing</u> <u>packages</u> <u>at</u> <u>build</u> <u>time</u>

       If  the  guest  OS  you are installing is similar to the host OS (eg.  both are Linux), and if libguestfs
       supports network connections, then you can use <u>--install</u> to install packages like this:

        virt-builder fedora-27 --install inkscape

       This uses the guest’s package manager and the host’s network connection.

       <u>Updating</u> <u>packages</u> <u>at</u> <u>build</u> <u>time</u>

       To update the installed packages in the template at build time:

        virt-builder fedora-27 --update

       Most of the templates that ship with virt-builder come with a very minimal selection of  packages  (known
       as a "JEOS" or "Just Enough Operating System"), which are up to date at the time the template is created,
       but  could  be  out of date by the time you come to install an OS from the template.  This option updates
       those template packages.

       <u>Installing</u> <u>packages</u> <u>at</u> <u>first</u> <u>boot</u>

       Another option is to install the packages when the guest first boots:

        virt-builder fedora-27 --firstboot-install inkscape

       This uses the guest’s package manager and the guest’s network connection.

       The downsides are that it will take the guest a lot longer to boot first time, and there’s  nothing  much
       you  can  do  if  package  installation  fails  (eg. if a network problem means the guest can't reach the
       package repositories).

       <u>Installing</u> <u>packages</u> <u>at</u> <u>build</u> <u>time</u> <u>from</u> <u>a</u> <u>side</u> <u>repository</u>

       If the software you want to install is not available in the main package repository of  the  guest,  then
       you can add a side repository.  Usually this is presented as an ISO (CD disk image) file containing extra
       packages.

       You  can  create  the  disk image using either <b><a href="../man1/genisoimage.1.html">genisoimage</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man1/virt-make-fs.1.html">virt-make-fs</a></b>(1).  For genisoimage, use a
       command like this:

        genisoimage -o extra-packages.iso -R -J -V EXTRA cdcontents/

       Create a script that mounts the ISO  and  sets  up  the  repository.   For  dnf,  create  /tmp/install.sh
       containing:

        mkdir /tmp/mount
        mount LABEL=EXTRA /tmp/mount

        cat &lt;&lt;'EOF' &gt; /etc/yum.repos.d/extra.repo
        [extra]
        name=extra
        baseurl=file:///tmp/mount
        enabled=1
        EOF

        dnf -y install famousdatabase

       For apt, create /tmp/install.sh containing:

        mkdir /tmp/mount
        mount LABEL=EXTRA /tmp/mount

        apt-cdrom -d=/tmp/mount add
        apt-get -y install famousdatabase

       Use the <u>--attach</u> option to attach the CD / disk image and the <u>--run</u> option to run the script:

        virt-builder fedora-27 \
          --attach extra-packages.iso \
          --run /tmp/install.sh

   <b>USERS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>PASSWORDS</b>
       The  <u>--root-password</u>  option  is  used to change the root password (otherwise a random password is used).
       This option takes a password "SELECTOR" in one of the following formats:

       <b>--root-password</b> file:FILENAME
           Read the root password from "FILENAME".  The whole  first  line  of  this  file  is  the  replacement
           password.   Any  other lines are ignored.  You should create the file with mode 0600 to ensure no one
           else can read it.

       <b>--root-password</b> password:PASSWORD
           Set the root password to the literal string "PASSWORD".

           <b>Note:</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>secure</b> since any user on the same machine can  see  the  cleartext  password  using
           <b><a href="../man1/ps.1.html">ps</a></b>(1).

       <b>--root-password</b> random
           Choose  a  random  password,  which is printed on stdout.  The password has approximately 120 bits of
           randomness.

           This is the default.

       <b>--root-password</b> disabled
           The root account password is disabled.  This is like putting "*" in the password field.

       <b>--root-password</b> locked:file:FILENAME
       <b>--root-password</b> locked:password:PASSWORD
       <b>--root-password</b> locked:random
           The root account is locked, but a password is placed  on  the  account.   If  first  unlocked  (using
           "passwd -u") then logins will use the given password.

       <b>--root-password</b> locked
       <b>--root-password</b> locked:disabled
           The root account is locked <u>and</u> password is disabled.

       <u>Creating</u> <u>user</u> <u>accounts</u>

       To create user accounts, use the <b><a href="../man8/useradd.8.html">useradd</a></b>(8) command with --firstboot-command like this:

        virt-builder --firstboot-command \
           'useradd -m -p "" rjones ; chage -d 0 rjones'

       The  above command will create an "rjones" account with no password, and force the user to set a password
       when they first log in.  There are other ways to manage passwords, see <b><a href="../man8/useradd.8.html">useradd</a></b>(8) for details.

       Because there are so many different ways to set the keyboard layout in Linux distributions,  virt-builder
       does  not  yet  attempt  to  have  a  simple  command line option.  This section describes how to set the
       keyboard for some common Linux distributions.

       <u>Keyboard</u> <u>layout</u> <u>with</u> <u>systemd</u>

       For distros that use systemd "localectl", use a command like this:

        virt-builder fedora-27 \
          --firstboot-command 'localectl set-keymap uk'

       See                                           <b><a href="../man1/localectl.1.html">localectl</a></b>(1)                                            and
       https://www.happyassassin.net/2013/11/23/keyboard-layouts-in-fedora-20-and-previously/ for more details.

       <u>Keyboard</u> <u>layout</u> <u>using</u> <u>/etc/sysconfig/keyboard</u>

       For  RHEL  ≤  6,  Fedora  ≤  18  and  similar, upload or modify the keyboard configuration file using the
       <u>--upload</u>, <u>--write</u> or <u>--edit</u> options.  For example:

        virt-builder centos-6 \
          --edit '/etc/sysconfig/keyboard: s/^KEYTABLE=.*/KEYTABLE="uk"/'

       The format of this file can be found documented in many places online.

       <u>Keyboard</u> <u>layout</u> <u>with</u> <u>Debian-derived</u> <u>distros</u>

       For Debian-derived distros using <u><a href="file:/etc/default/keyboard">/etc/default/keyboard</a></u>, upload or modify  the  keyboard  file  using  the
       <u>--upload</u>, <u>--write</u> or <u>--edit</u> options.  For example:

        virt-builder debian-8 \
          --edit '<a href="file:/etc/default/keyboard">/etc/default/keyboard</a>: s/^XKBLAYOUT=.*/XKBLAYOUT="gb"/'

       See https://wiki.debian.org/Keyboard.

   <b>LANGUAGE</b>
       Most  Linux distributions support multiple locale settings so that you can have guest messages printed in
       another language such as Russian.

       However there is no single setting which controls this, since extra packages may need to be installed  to
       support  console and X fonts, and keyboard input methods.  The packages required, and their configuration
       is highly distro-specific, and it is outside the scope of virt-builder to do this.

       This section contains examples for some common Linux distributions.

       <u>Setting</u> <u>Japanese</u> <u>in</u> <u>Fedora</u> <u>25</u>

        virt-builder fedora-27 \
          --size 20G \
          --update \
          --install @japanese-support \
          --install @xfce \
          --install xorg-x11-server-Xorg,xorg-x11-drivers,rsyslog \
          --link <a href="file:/usr/lib/systemd/system/graphical.target">/usr/lib/systemd/system/graphical.target</a>:/etc/systemd/system/default.target \
          --firstboot-command 'localectl set-locale LANG=ja_JP.utf8' \
          --firstboot-command 'localectl set-keymap jp' \
          --firstboot-command 'systemctl isolate graphical.target'

       <u>Setting</u> <u>Japanese</u> <u>in</u> <u>Debian</u> <u>8</u> <u>(Jessie)</u>

       Note that although this enables Japanese in the text console too,  it  is  unlikely  that  you  will  see
       properly rendered Japanese there.  However Japanese is properly rendered in X applications and terminals.

          --write '<a href="file:/etc/default/locale">/etc/default/locale</a>:LANG="ja_JP.UTF-8"' \
          --run-command "locale-gen"

   <b>LOG</b> <b>FILE</b>
       Scripts  and package installation that runs at build time (<u>--run</u>, <u>--run-command</u>, <u>--install</u>, <u>--update</u>, but
       <u>not</u> firstboot) is logged in one of the following locations:

       <u>/tmp/builder.log</u>
           On Linux, BSD, and other non-Windows guests.

       <u>C:\Temp\builder.log</u>
           On Windows, DOS guests.

       <u>/builder.log</u>
           If <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u> or <u>C:\Temp</u> is missing.

       If you don’t want the log file to appear in the final image,  then  use  the  <u>--no-logfile</u>  command  line
       option.

   <b>SSH</b> <b>KEYS</b>
       The  <u>--ssh-inject</u>  option  is  used  to inject ssh keys for users in the guest, so they can login without
       supplying a password.

       The "SELECTOR" part of the option value is optional; in this case, <u>--ssh-inject</u> "USER" means that we look
       in the <u>current</u> user’s <u><a href="file:~/.ssh">~/.ssh</a></u> directory to find the  default  public  ID  file.   That  key  is  uploaded.
       "default public ID" is the <u>default_ID_file</u> file described in <b><a href="../man1/ssh-copy-id.1.html">ssh-copy-id</a></b>(1).

       If specified, the "SELECTOR" can be in one of the following formats:

       <b>--ssh-inject</b> USER:file:FILENAME
           Read the ssh key from <u>FILENAME</u>.  <u>FILENAME</u> is usually a <u>.pub</u> file.

       <b>--ssh-inject</b> USER:string:KEY_STRING
           Use  the  specified  "KEY_STRING".   "KEY_STRING"  is  usually  a public string like <u>ssh-rsa</u> <u>AAAA....</u>
           <u>user@localhost</u>.

       In any case, the <u>~USER/.ssh</u> directory and the <u>~USER/.ssh/authorized_keys</u> file  will  be  created  if  not
       existing already.

   <b>FIRST</b> <b>BOOT</b> <b>SCRIPTS</b>
       The  <u>--firstboot</u>  and  <u>--firstboot-command</u> options allow you to execute commands at the first boot of the
       guest.  To do so, an init script for the guest init system is installed, which takes care of running  all
       the added scripts and commands.

       Supported operating systems are:

       Linux
           Init  systems  supported are: systemd, System-V init (known also as sysvinit), and Upstart (using the
           System-V scripts).

           Note that usually init scripts run as root, but with a more limited environment than  what  could  be
           available from a normal shell: for example, $HOME may be unset or empty.

           The output of the first boot scripts is available in the guest as <u>~root/virt-sysprep-firstboot.log</u>.

       Windows
           <u>rhsrvany.exe</u>,   available  from  sources  at  https://github.com/rwmjones/rhsrvany,  or  <u>pvvxsvc.exe</u>,
           available with SUSE VMDP is installed to run the first boot scripts.  It is required, and  the  setup
           of first boot scripts will fail if it is not present.

           <u>rhsrvany.exe</u>  or  <u>pvvxsvc.exe</u>  is  copied  from  the location pointed to by the "VIRT_TOOLS_DATA_DIR"
           environment  variable;  if  not  set,  a  compiled-in  default   will   be   used   (something   like
           <u>/usr/share/virt-tools</u>).

           The   output   of   the   first   boot   scripts   is   available   in   the   guest   as  <u>C:\Program</u>
           <u>Files\Guestfs\Firstboot\log.txt</u>.

   <b>SUBSCRIPTION-MANAGER</b>
       It is possible to automate the registration and attaching of  the  system  using  "subscription-manager".
       This is typical on Red Hat Enterprise Linux guests.  There are few options which ease this process, avoid
       executing commands manually and exposing passwords on command line.

       <u>--sm-register</u>  starts the registration process, and requires <u>--sm-credentials</u> to be specified; the format
       of the "SELECTOR" of <u>--sm-credentials</u> is one of the following formats:

       <b>--sm-credentials</b> USER:file:FILENAME
           Read the password for the specified "USER" from <u>FILENAME</u>.

       <b>--sm-credentials</b> USER:password:PASSWORD
           Use the literal string "PASSWORD" for the specified "USER".

       <u>--sm-attach</u> attaches the system to subscriptions; the format of its "SELECTOR" is one of the following:

       <b>--sm-attach</b> auto
           "subscription-manager" attaches to the best-fitting subscriptions for the system.

       <b>--sm-attach</b> file:FILENAME
           Read the pool ID from <u>FILENAME</u>.

       <b>--sm-attach</b> pool:POOL
           Use the literal string "POOL" as pool ID.

       <u>--sm-remove</u> removes all the subscriptions from the guest, while <u>--sm-unregister</u> completely unregister the
       system.

   <b>INSTALLATION</b> <b>PROCESS</b>
       When you invoke virt-builder, installation proceeds as follows:

       •   The template image is downloaded.

           If the template image is present in the cache, the cached version is used instead.  (See "CACHING").

       •   The template signature is checked.

       •   The template is uncompressed to a tmp file.

       •   The template image is resized into the destination, using <b><a href="../man1/virt-resize.1.html">virt-resize</a></b>(1).

       •   Extra disks are attached (<u>--attach</u>).

       •   A new random seed is generated for the guest.

       •   Guest customization is performed, in the order specified on the command line.

       •   SELinux relabelling is done unless disabled with <u>--no-selinux-relabel</u>.

   <b>IMPORTING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>DISK</b> <b>IMAGE</b>
       <u>Importing</u> <u>into</u> <u>libvirt</u>

       Import the disk image into libvirt using <b><a href="../man1/virt-install.1.html">virt-install</a></b>(1) <u>--import</u> option.

        virt-install --import \
          --name guest --ram 2048 \
          --disk path=disk.img,format=raw --os-variant fedora27

       Notes:

       1.  You <u>must</u> specify the correct format.  The format is "raw" unless  you  used  virt-builder’s  <u>--format</u>
           option.

       2.  <u>--os-variant</u>  is  highly  recommended, because it will present optimum devices to enable the guest to
           run most efficiently.  To get a list of all variants, do:

            osinfo-query os

           The above tool is provided by libosinfo package.

       3.  You can run virt-install as root or  non-root.   Each  works  slightly  differently  because  libvirt
           manages a different set of virtual machines for each user.  In particular virt-manager normally shows
           the root-owned VMs, whereas Boxes shows the user-owned VMs, and other tools probably work differently
           as well.

       <u>Importing</u> <u>into</u> <u>OpenStack</u>

       Import the image into Glance (the OpenStack image store) by doing:

        glance image-create --name fedora-27-image --file fedora-27.img \
          --disk-format raw --container-format bare \
          --is-public True

       The  <u>--file</u>  parameter is the virt-builder-generated disk image.  It should match virt-builder’s <u>--output</u>
       option.  The <u>--disk-format</u> parameter should match virt-builder’s <u>--format</u> option (or "raw" if you  didn't
       use  that  option).  The <u>--container-format</u> should always be "bare" since virt-builder doesn't put images
       into containers.

       You can use the "glance image-show <u>fedora-27-image</u>" command to display the properties of the image.

       To boot up an instance of your image on a Nova compute node, do:

        nova boot fedora-27-server --image fedora-27-image \
          --flavor m1.medium

       Use "nova flavor-list" to list possible machine flavors.  Use "nova list" to list running instances.

       <u>Booting</u> <u>directly</u> <u>using</u> <u>qemu</u> <u>or</u> <u>KVM</u>

       The qemu command line is not very stable or easy to use,  hence  libvirt  should  be  used  if  possible.
       However a command line similar to the following could be used to boot the virtual machine:

        qemu-system-x86_64 \
          -machine accel=kvm:tcg \
          -cpu host \
          -m 2048 \
          -drive file=disk.img,format=raw,if=virtio

       As  with  libvirt,  it  is very important that the correct format is chosen.  It will be "raw" unless the
       <u>--format</u> option was used.

   <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>MANAGEMENT</b>
       <u>Puppet</u>

       To enable the Puppet agent in a guest, install the package, point the configuration at your Puppetmaster,
       and ensure the agent runs at boot.

       A typical virt-builder command would be:

        virt-builder fedora-27 \
          --hostname client.example.com \
          --update \
          --install puppet \
          --append-line '/etc/puppet/puppet.conf:[agent]' \
          --append-line '/etc/puppet/puppet.conf:server = puppetmaster.example.com/' \
          --run-command 'systemctl enable puppet'

       The  precise  instructions  vary  according  to  the  Linux  distro.   For   further   information   see:
       https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/install_pre.html

   <b>DEBUGGING</b> <b>BUILDS</b>
       If virt-builder itself fails, then enable debugging (<u>-v</u>) and report a bug (see "BUGS" below).

       If   virt-builder   fails   because   some   script   or  package  it  is  installing  fails,  try  using
       <u>--no-delete-on-failure</u> to preserve the output file, and continue reading this section.

       If virt-builder is successful but the image doesn't work, here are some things to try:

       Use virt-rescue
           Run <b><a href="../man1/virt-rescue.1.html">virt-rescue</a></b>(1) on the disk image:

            virt-rescue -a disk.img

           This gives you a rescue shell.  You can mount the filesystems from the disk  image  on  <u>/sysroot</u>  and
           examine  them  using  ordinary  Linux  commands.  You can also chroot into the guest to reinstall the
           bootloader.  The virt-rescue man page has a lot more information and examples.

       Use guestfish
           Run <b><a href="../man1/guestfish.1.html">guestfish</a></b>(1) on the disk image:

            guestfish -a disk.img -i

           Use guestfish commands like "ll /directory" and "cat /file" to examine directories and files.

       Use guestmount
           Mount the disk image safely on the host using FUSE and <b><a href="../man1/guestmount.1.html">guestmount</a></b>(1):

            mkdir /tmp/mp
            guestmount -a disk.img -i /tmp/mp
            cd /tmp/mp

           To unmount the disk image do:

            fusermount -u /tmp/mp

       Add a serial console
           If the guest hangs during boot, it can be helpful to add a serial console to the  guest,  and  direct
           kernel  messages  to  the  serial  console.   Adding  the  serial console will involve looking at the
           documentation for your hypervisor.  To  direct  kernel  messages  to  the  serial  console,  add  the
           following on the kernel command line:

            console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200

   <b>SOURCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>TEMPLATES</b>
       virt-builder  reads  the available sources from configuration files, with the <u>.conf</u> extension and located
       in the following paths:

       •   $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/virt-builder/repos.d/ ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME is <u>$HOME/.config</u> if not set).

       •   $VIRT_BUILDER_DIRS/virt-builder/repos.d/ (where $VIRT_BUILDER_DIRS means any of  the  directories  in
           that environment variable, or just <u><a href="file:/etc">/etc</a></u> if not set).

       Each <u>.conf</u> file in those paths has a simple text format like the following:

        [libguestfs.org]
        uri=<a href="http://libguestfs.org/download/builder/index.asc">http://libguestfs.org/download/builder/index.asc</a>
        gpgkey=file:///etc/xdg/virt-builder/repos.d/libguestfs.gpg

       The part in square brackets is the repository identifier, which is used as unique identifier.

       The following fields can appear:

       "uri=URI"
           The URI of the index file which this repository refers to.

           This field is required.

       "gpgkey=URI"
           This  optional  field represents the URI (although only <u>file://</u> URIs are accepted) of the key used to
           sign the index file.  If not present, the index file referred by <u>uri=..</u> is not signed.

       "proxy=MODE"
           This optional field specifies the proxy mode, to be used when downloading  the  index  file  of  this
           repository.  The possible values are:

           <b>no</b>, <b>off</b>
               No proxy is being used at all, even overriding the system configuration.

           <b>system</b>
               The proxy used is the system one.

           <u>anything</u> <u>else</u>
               Specifies the actual proxy configuration to be used, overriding the system configuration.

           If  not  present, the assumed value is to respect the proxy settings of the system (i.e. as if <b>system</b>
           would be specified).

       "format=FORMAT"
           This optional field specifies the format of the repository.  The possible values are:

           <b>native</b>
               The native format of the "virt-builder" repository.  See also "Creating  and  signing  the  index
               file" below.

           <b>simplestreams</b>
               The URI represents the root of a Simple Streams v1.0 tree of metadata.

               For more information about Simple Streams, see also https://launchpad.net/simplestreams.

           If not present, the assumed value is "native".

       For serious virt-builder use, you may want to create your own repository of templates.

       <u>Libguestfs.org</u> <u>repository</u>

       Out of the box, virt-builder downloads the file <a href="http://libguestfs.org/download/builder/index.asc">http://libguestfs.org/download/builder/index.asc</a> which is
       an  index of available templates plus some information about each one, wrapped up in a digital signature.
       The command "virt-builder --list" lists out the information in this index file.

       The templates hosted on libguestfs.org were created using shell  scripts,  kickstart  files  and  preseed
       files which can be found in the libguestfs source tree, in "builder/templates".

       <u>Setting</u> <u>up</u> <u>the</u> <u>repository</u>

       You  can set up your own site containing an index file and some templates, and then point virt-builder at
       the site by creating a <u>.conf</u> file pointing to it.

       Note that if your index is signed, you will need to properly fill <u>gpgkey=..</u> in your  <u>.conf</u>  file,  making
       sure to deploy also the GPG key file.

        virt-builder --source https://example.com/builder/index.asc \
           --fingerprint 'AAAA BBBB ...' \
           --list

       You can host this on any web or FTP server, or a local or network filesystem.

       <u>Setting</u> <u>up</u> <u>a</u> <u>GPG</u> <u>key</u>

       If  you don’t have a GnuPG key, you will need to set one up.  (Strictly speaking this is optional, but if
       your  index  and  template  files  are  not  signed  then  virt-builder  users  will  have  to  use   the
       <u>--no-check-signature</u> flag every time they use virt-builder.)

       To create a key, see the GPG manual <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html">http://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html</a>.

       Export your GPG public key:

        gpg --export -a "<a href="mailto:you@example.com">you@example.com</a>" &gt; pubkey

       <u>Create</u> <u>the</u> <u>templates</u>

       There  are  many  ways  to  create  the  templates.   For  example  you  could clone existing guests (see
       <b><a href="../man1/virt-sysprep.1.html">virt-sysprep</a></b>(1)), or you could install a guest by hand (<b><a href="../man1/virt-install.1.html">virt-install</a></b>(1)).  To see how the templates  were
       created for virt-builder, look at the scripts in "builder/templates"

       Virt-builder  supports any image format (e.g. raw, qcow2, etc) as template, both as-is, and compressed as
       XZ.  This way, existing images (e.g. cleaned using <b><a href="../man1/virt-sysprep.1.html">virt-sysprep</a></b>(1)) can be used as templates.

       For best results when compressing the templates, use the following xz  options  (see  <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-xz-plugin.1.html">nbdkit-xz-plugin</a></b>(1)
       for further explanation):

        xz --best --block-size=16777216 disk

       <u>Creating</u> <u>and</u> <u>signing</u> <u>the</u> <u>index</u> <u>file</u>

       The index file has a simple text format (shown here without the digital signature):

        [fedora-18]
        name=Fedora® 18
        osinfo=fedora18
        arch=x86_64

        checksum[sha512]=...
        format=raw

        checksum[sha512]=...
        revision=3
        format=raw
        size=4294967296
        compressed_size=172190964
        expand=/dev/sda3

       The  part  in  square  brackets  is  the "os-version", which is the same string that is used on the virt-
       builder command line to build that OS.

       The index file creation and signature can be eased with the <b><a href="../man1/virt-builder-repository.1.html">virt-builder-repository</a></b>(1) tool.

       After preparing the "index" file in the correct format, clearsign it using the following command:

        gpg --clearsign --armor index

       This will create the final file called <u>index.asc</u> which can be uploaded to the server (and is  the  <u>uri=..</u>
       URL).  As noted above, signing the index file is optional, but recommended.

       The following fields can appear:

       "name=NAME"
           The user-friendly name of this template.  This is displayed in the <u>--list</u> output but is otherwise not
           significant.

       "osinfo=ID"
           This  optional field maps the operating system to the associated libosinfo ID.  Virt-builder does not
           use it (yet).

       "arch=ARCH"
           The architecture of the operating system installed within the template. This field is required.

       "file=PATH"
           The path (relative to the index) of the xz-compressed template.

           Note that absolute paths or URIs are <b>not</b> permitted here.  This is because virt-builder  has  a  "same
           origin" policy for templates so they cannot come from other servers.

       "sig=PATH"
           <b>This</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>deprecated</b>.  Use the checksum field instead.

           The path (relative to the index) of the GPG detached signature of the xz file.

           Note  that  absolute  paths or URIs are <b>not</b> permitted here.  This is because virt-builder has a "same
           origin" policy for templates so they cannot come from other servers.

           The file can be created as follows:

            gpg --detach-sign --armor -o disk.xz.sig disk.xz

       "checksum[sha512]=7b882fe9b82eb0fef..."
           The SHA-512 checksum of the file specified in <u>file=..</u> is checked after it is downloaded.  To work out
           the signature, do:

            sha512sum disk.xz

           Note if you use this, you don’t need to sign the file, ie. don’t use "sig".   This  option  overrides
           "sig".

       "checksum=7b882fe9b82eb0fef..."
           "checksum" is an alias for "checksum[sha512]".

           If  you  need to interoperate with virt-builder = 1.24.0 then you have to use "checksum" because that
           version would give a parse error with square brackets and numbers in the key of  a  field.   This  is
           fixed in virt-builder ≥ 1.24.1.

       "revision=N"
           The  revision  is  an  integer  which is used to control the template cache.  Increasing the revision
           number causes clients to download the template again even if they have a copy in the cache.

           The revision number is optional.  If omitted it defaults to 1.

       "format=raw"
       "format=qcow2"
           Specify the format of the disk image; in case it  is  compressed,  that  is  the  format  before  the
           compression.   If  not  given,  the format is autodetected, but generally it is better to be explicit
           about the intended format.

           Note this is the source format, which  is  different  from  the  <u>--format</u>  option  (requested  output
           format).   Virt-builder  does  on-the-fly  conversion  from the source format to the requested output
           format.

       "size=NNN"
           The virtual size of the image in bytes.  This is the size of the image when uncompressed.  If using a
           non-raw format such as qcow2 then it means the virtual disk size, not the size of the qcow2 file.

           This field is required.

           Virt-builder also uses this as the minimum size that users can request via the <u>--size</u> option,  or  as
           the default size if there is no <u>--size</u> option.

       "compressed_size=NNN"
           The  actual  size  of the disk image in bytes, i.e. what was specified in <u>file=..</u>.  This is just used
           for information (when using "long", and "json" formats of <u>--list</u>).

       "expand=/dev/sdaX"
           When expanding the image to its final size, instruct <b><a href="../man1/virt-resize.1.html">virt-resize</a></b>(1) to expand the named partition  in
           the guest image to fill up all available space.  This works like the virt-resize <u>--expand</u> option.

           You should usually put the device name of the guest’s root filesystem here.

           It’s a good idea to use this, but not required.  If the field is omitted then virt-resize will create
           an extra partition at the end of the disk to cover the free space, which is much less user-friendly.

       "lvexpand=/dev/VolGroup/LogVol"
           When  expanding  the  image  to  its  final size, instruct <b><a href="../man1/virt-resize.1.html">virt-resize</a></b>(1) to expand the named logical
           volume in the guest image  to  fill  up  all  available  space.   This  works  like  the  virt-resize
           <u>--lv-expand</u> option.

           If  the  guest  uses  LVM2 you should usually put the LV of the guest’s root filesystem here.  If the
           guest does not use LVM2 or its root filesystem is not on an LV, don't use this option.

       "notes=NOTES"
           Any notes that go with this image, especially notes describing what packages are in  the  image,  how
           the image was prepared, and licensing information.

           This information is shown in the <u>--notes</u> and <u>--list</u> <u>--long</u> modes.

           You  can  use  multi-line  notes  here  by  indenting  each  new  line with at least one character of
           whitespace (even on blank lines):

            notes=This image was prepared using
             the following kickstart script:
                                           &lt;-- one space at beginning of line
             part <a href="file:/boot">/boot</a> --fstype ext3
             ...

       "hidden=true"
           Using the hidden flag prevents the template from being listed by the <u>--list</u> option (but it  is  still
           installable).  This is used for test images.

       "aliases=ALIAS1 ALIAS2 ..."
           This optional field specifies a list of aliases, separated by spaces, for the image.  For example, an
           alias  could  be  used  to  always  point  to  the latest version of a certain image, leaving the old
           versions available in the index instead of updating the same image (see the "revision" field).

       <u>Running</u> <u>virt-builder</u> <u>against</u> <u>multiple</u> <u>sources</u>

       It is possible to use multiple sources with virt-builder.  The recommended way is to deploy  <u>.conf</u>  files
       pointing  to  the  index  files.  Another  way  is  to specify the sources using multiple <u>--source</u> and/or
       <u>--fingerprint</u> options:

        virt-builder \
          --source <a href="http://example.com/s1/index.asc">http://example.com/s1/index.asc</a> \
          --source <a href="http://example.com/s2/index.asc">http://example.com/s2/index.asc</a>

       You can provide N or 1 fingerprints.  In the case where you provide N fingerprints, N = number of sources
       and there is a 1-1 correspondence between each source and each fingerprint:

        virt-builder \
          --source <a href="http://example.com/s1/index.asc">http://example.com/s1/index.asc</a> --fingerprint '0123 ...' \
          --source <a href="http://example.com/s2/index.asc">http://example.com/s2/index.asc</a> --fingerprint '9876 ...'

       In the case where you provide 1 fingerprint, the same fingerprint is used for all sources.

       You "must" provide at least 1 fingerprint.

       <u>Licensing</u> <u>of</u> <u>templates</u>

       You should be aware of the licensing of images that you distribute.  For open source  guests,  provide  a
       link to the source code in the "notes" field and comply with other requirements (eg. around trademarks).

       <u>Formal</u> <u>specification</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>index</u> <u>file</u>

       The  index  file  format  has a formal specification defined by the flex scanner and bison parser used to
       parse the file.  This can be found in the following files in the libguestfs source tree:

        builder/index-scan.l
        builder/index-parse.y

       A tool called <b><a href="../man1/virt-index-validate.1.html">virt-index-validate</a></b>(1) is available to validate the index file to ensure it is correct.

       Note that the parser and tool can work on either  the  signed  or  unsigned  index  file  (ie.  <u>index</u>  or
       <u>index.asc</u>).

       The index is always encoded in UTF-8.

   <b>CACHING</b>
       <u>Caching</u> <u>templates</u>

       Since the templates are usually very large, downloaded templates are cached in the user’s home directory.

       The location of the cache is <u>$XDG_CACHE_HOME/virt-builder/</u> or <u>$HOME/.cache/virt-builder</u>.

       You  can print out information about the cache directory, including which guests are currently cached, by
       doing:

        virt-builder --print-cache

       The cache can be deleted if you want to save space by doing:

        virt-builder --delete-cache

       You can download all (current) templates to the local cache by doing:

        virt-builder --cache-all-templates

       To disable the template cache, use <u>--no-cache</u>.

       Only templates are cached.  The index and detached digital signatures are not cached.

       <u>Caching</u> <u>packages</u>

       Virt-builder uses <b><a href="../man1/curl.1.html">curl</a></b>(1) to download files and it also uses the current "http_proxy" (etc) settings when
       installing packages (<u>--install</u>, <u>--update</u>).

       You may therefore want to set those environment variables in  order  to  maximize  the  amount  of  local
       caching that happens.  See "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES" and <b><a href="../man1/curl.1.html">curl</a></b>(1).

       <u>Local</u> <u>mirrors</u>

       To  increase  both  speed  and  reliability  of installing packages, you can set up a local mirror of the
       target distribution, and point the guest package manager at that.

       Using a local mirror with Fedora

       To install a Fedora guest using a local mirror:

        virt-builder fedora-27 \
          --edit '/etc/yum.repos.d/fedora.repo:
              s{.*baseurl=.*}{baseurl=<a href="http://example.com/mirror/">http://example.com/mirror/</a>};
              s{.*metalink=.*}{};
          ' \
          --edit '/etc/yum.repos.d/fedora-updates.repo:
              s{.*baseurl=.*}{baseurl=<a href="http://example.com/mirror-updates/">http://example.com/mirror-updates/</a>};
              s{.*metalink=.*}{};
          ' \
          --run-command 'dnf -y update' \
          --install 'pkg1,pkg2,...'

       Using a local mirror with Debian

       Assuming that you are using "apt-proxy" to mirror the repository, you should create  a  new  <u>sources.list</u>
       file to point to your proxy (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptProxy) and then do:

        virt-builder debian-8 \
          --upload sources.list:<a href="file:/etc/apt/sources.list">/etc/apt/sources.list</a> \
          --run-command 'apt-get -y update' \
          --install 'pkg1,pkg2,...'

   <b>DIGITAL</b> <b>SIGNATURES</b>
       Virt-builder  uses  GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG or gpg) to verify that the index and templates have not been
       tampered with.

       The source points to an index file, which is optionally signed.

       Virt-builder downloads the index and checks that the signature is  valid  and  the  signer’s  fingerprint
       matches  the  specified  fingerprint  (ie.  the  one  specified  in  <u>gpgkey=..</u>  in  the  <u>.conf</u>,  or  with
       <u>--fingerprint</u>, in that order).

       For checking against the built-in public key/fingerprint, this requires importing the public key into the
       user’s local gpg keyring (that’s just the way that gpg works).

       When a template is downloaded, its signature is checked in the same way.

       Although the signatures are optional, if you don’t have them then virt-builder users  will  have  to  use
       <u>--no-check-signature</u> on the command line.  This prevents an attacker from replacing the signed index file
       with an unsigned index file and having virt-builder silently work without checking the signature.  In any
       case it is highly recommended that you always create signed index and templates.

   <b>ARCHITECTURE</b>
       Virt-builder can build a guest for any architecture no matter what the host architecture is.  For example
       an x86-64 guest on an ARM host.

       However  certain  options  may  not work, specifically options that require running commands in the guest
       during the build process: <u>--install</u>, <u>--update</u>, <u>--run</u>, <u>--run-command</u>.  You may need to replace these  with
       their firstboot-equivalents.

       An x86-64 host building 32 bit i686 guests should work without any special steps.

   <b>SECURITY</b>
       Virt-builder  does  not need to run as root (in fact, should not be run as root), and doesn't use setuid,
       "sudo" or any similar mechanism.

       <u>--install</u>, <u>--update</u>, <u>--run</u> and <u>--run-command</u> are implemented using an appliance (a small virtual machine)
       so these commands do not run on the host.  If you are using  the  libguestfs  libvirt  backend  and  have
       SELinux enabled then the virtual machine is additionally encapsulated in an SELinux container (sVirt).

       However these options will have access to the host’s network and since the template may contain untrusted
       code,  the code might try to access host network resources which it should not.  You can use <u>--no-network</u>
       to prevent this.

       Firstboot commands run in the context of the guest when it  is  booted,  and  so  the  security  of  your
       hypervisor / cloud should be considered.

       Virt-builder  injects  a  random  seed  into  every guest which it builds.  This helps to ensure that TCP
       sequence numbers, UUIDs, ssh host keys etc are truly random when the guest boots.

       You should check digital signatures and not ignore any signing errors.

   <b>CLONES</b>
       If you wish to create many new guests of the same type, it is tempting to run virt-builder once and  then
       copy  the  output file.  You should <b>not</b> do this.  You should run virt-builder once for each new guest you
       need.

       The reason is that each clone needs to have (at least) a separate random seed, and possibly other  unique
       features (such as filesystem UUIDs) in future versions of virt-builder.

       Another  thing  you  should <u>not</u> do is to boot the guest, then clone the booted disk image.  The reason is
       that some guests create unique machine IDs, SSH host keys and so on at first boot, and you would not want
       clones to have duplicate identities.

       See also: <b><a href="../man1/virt-sysprep.1.html">virt-sysprep</a></b>(1).

   <b>PERFORMANCE</b>
       The most important aspect of getting good performance is caching.  Templates  gets  downloaded  into  the
       cache  the first time they are used, or if you use the <u>--cache-all-templates</u> option.  See "CACHING" above
       for further information.

       Packages required for  the  <u>--install</u>  and  <u>--update</u>  options  are  downloaded  using  the  host  network
       connection.   Setting the "http_proxy", "https_proxy" and "ftp_proxy" environment variables to point to a
       local web cache may ensure they only need to be downloaded once.  You can also try using a local  package
       repository,  although  this  can  be complex to set up and varies according to which Linux distro you are
       trying to install.

       <u>Using</u> <u>--no-sync</u>

       Use <u>--no-sync</u>.  However read the caveats in the "OPTIONS"  section  above,  since  this  can  cause  disk
       corruption if not used correctly.

       <u>Skipping</u> <u>virt-resize</u>

       Virt-builder  can  skip  the  virt-resize  step  under  certain conditions.  This makes virt-builder much
       faster.  The conditions are:

       •   the output must be a regular file (not a block device), <b>and</b>

       •   the user did <b>not</b> use the <u>--size</u> option, <b>and</b>

       •   the output format is the same as the template format (usually raw).

       <u>pxzcat</u>

       Virt-builder uses an internal implementation of pxzcat (parallel xzcat) if liblzma  was  found  at  build
       time.  If liblzma was not found at build time, regular "xzcat" is used which is single-threaded.

   <b>SELINUX</b>
       Guests  which  use  SELinux  (such  as  Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux) require that each file has a
       correct SELinux label.

       Virt-builder does not know how to give new files a label, so there are two possible strategies it can use
       to ensure correct labelling:

       Automatic relabeling
           This runs <b><a href="../man8/setfiles.8.html">setfiles</a></b>(8) just before finalizing the guest, which sets SELinux labels  correctly  in  the
           disk image.

           This is the recommended method.

       Using <u>--no-selinux-relabel</u> <u>--touch</u> <u>/.autorelabel</u>
           Guest templates may already contain a file called <u>/.autorelabel</u> or you may touch it.

           For  guests  that  use  SELinux,  this causes <b><a href="../man8/restorecon.8.html">restorecon</a></b>(8) to run at first boot.  Guests will reboot
           themselves once the first time you use them, which is normal and harmless.

</pre><h4><b>MACHINE</b> <b>READABLE</b> <b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>--machine-readable</u> option can be used to make the output more machine friendly, which is useful  when
       calling virt-builder from other programs, GUIs etc.

       Use  the  option  on  its own to query the capabilities of the virt-builder binary.  Typical output looks
       like this:

        $ virt-builder --machine-readable
        virt-builder
        arch
        config-file
        customize
        json-list
        pxzcat

       A list of features is printed, one per line, and the program exits with status 0.

       It is possible to specify a format string for controlling the  output;  see  "ADVANCED  MACHINE  READABLE
       OUTPUT" in <b><a href="../man3/guestfs.3.html">guestfs</a></b>(3).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       For  other  environment  variables  which  affect all libguestfs programs, see "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES" in
       <b><a href="../man3/guestfs.3.html">guestfs</a></b>(3).

       "http_proxy"
       "https_proxy"
       "no_proxy"
           Set the proxy for downloads.  These environment variables (and  more)  are  actually  interpreted  by
           <b><a href="../man1/curl.1.html">curl</a></b>(1), not virt-builder.

       "HOME"
           Used  to  determine  the  location of the template cache, and the location of the user' sources.  See
           "CACHING" and "SOURCES OF TEMPLATES".

       "VIRT_TOOLS_DATA_DIR"
           This can point to the directory containing data files used for Windows firstboot installation.

           Normally you do not need to set this.  If not set, a compiled-in default will be used (something like
           <u>/usr/share/virt-tools</u>).

           This directory may contain the following files:

           <u>rhsrvany.exe</u>
               This is the RHSrvAny Windows binary, used to install a "firstboot" script in Windows guests.   It
               is  required  if  you  intend  to use the <u>--firstboot</u> or <u>--firstboot-command</u> options with Windows
               guests.

               See also: "https://github.com/rwmjones/rhsrvany"

           <u>pvvxsvc.exe</u>
               This is a Windows binary shipped with SUSE VMDP, used to install a "firstboot" script in  Windows
               guests.   It is required if you intend to use the <u>--firstboot</u> or <u>--firstboot-command</u> options with
               Windows guests.

       "XDG_CACHE_HOME"
           Used to determine the location of the template cache.  See "CACHING".

       "XDG_CONFIG_HOME"
           Used to determine the location of the user' sources.  See "SOURCES OF TEMPLATES".

       "VIRT_BUILDER_DIRS"
           Used to determine the location of the system sources.  See "SOURCES OF TEMPLATES".
