</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>age</b> - simple, modern, and secure file encryption

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>age</b> [<b>--encrypt</b>] (<b>-r</b> <u>RECIPIENT</u> | <b>-R</b> <u>PATH</u>)... [<b>--armor</b>] [<b>-o</b> <u>OUTPUT</u>] [<u>INPUT</u>]
       <b>age</b> [<b>--encrypt</b>] <b>--passphrase</b> [<b>--armor</b>] [<b>-o</b> <u>OUTPUT</u>] [<u>INPUT</u>]
       <b>age</b> <b>--decrypt</b> [<b>-i</b> <u>PATH</u> | <b>-j</b> <u>PLUGIN</u>]... [<b>-o</b> <u>OUTPUT</u>] [<u>INPUT</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>age</b>  encrypts or decrypts <u>INPUT</u> to <u>OUTPUT</u>. The <u>INPUT</u> argument is optional and defaults to standard input.
       Only a single <u>INPUT</u> file may be specified. If <b>-o</b> is not specified, <u>OUTPUT</u> defaults to standard output.

       If <b>-p</b>/<b>--passphrase</b> is specified, the  file  is  encrypted  with  a  passphrase  requested  interactively.
       Otherwise,   it's   encrypted   to   one   or   more   <u>RECIPIENTS</u>   specified   with   <b>-r</b>/<b>--recipient</b>  or
       <b>-R</b>/<b>--recipients-file</b>. Every recipient can decrypt the file.

       In <b>-d</b>/<b>--decrypt</b> mode, passphrase-encrypted  files  are  detected  automatically  and  the  passphrase  is
       requested  interactively.  Otherwise,  one  or  more  <u>IDENTITIES</u> specified with <b>-i</b>/<b>--identity</b> are used to
       decrypt the file.

       <b>age</b> encrypted files are binary and not malleable, with around 200 bytes of overhead per  recipient,  plus
       16 bytes every 64KiB of plaintext.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-o</b>, <b>--output</b>=<u>OUTPUT</u>
              Write  encrypted  or decrypted file to <u>OUTPUT</u> instead of standard output. If <u>OUTPUT</u> already exists
              it will be overwritten.

              If encrypting without <b>--armor</b>, <b>age</b> will refuse to output binary to a TTY. This can  be  forced  by
              specifying <b>-</b> as <u>OUTPUT</u>.

       <b>--version</b>
              Print the version and exit.

   <b>Encryption</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-e</b>, <b>--encrypt</b>
              Encrypt <u>INPUT</u> to <u>OUTPUT</u>. This is the default.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--recipient</b>=<u>RECIPIENT</u>
              Encrypt  to  the  explicitly  specified  <u>RECIPIENT</u>.  See the <u>RECIPIENTS</u> <u>AND</u> <u>IDENTITIES</u> section for
              possible recipient formats.

              This option can be repeated and combined with other recipient flags, and the file can be decrypted
              by all provided recipients independently.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--recipients-file</b>=<u>PATH</u>
              Encrypt to the <u>RECIPIENTS</u> listed in the file at <u>PATH</u>, one per line. Empty lines and lines starting
              with <b>#</b> are ignored as comments.

              If <u>PATH</u> is <b>-</b>, the recipients are read from standard input. In this case, the <u>INPUT</u>  argument  must
              be specified.

              This option can be repeated and combined with other recipient flags, and the file can be decrypted
              by all provided recipients independently.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--passphrase</b>
              Encrypt  with  a  passphrase,  requested  interactively  from  the  terminal.  <b>age</b>  will  offer to
              auto-generate a secure passphrase.

              This option can't be used with other recipient flags.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--armor</b>
              Encrypt to an ASCII-only "armored" encoding.

              <b>age</b> armor is a strict version of PEM with type <b>AGE</b> <b>ENCRYPTED</b> <b>FILE</b>, canonical "strict"  Base64,  no
              headers, and no support for leading and trailing extra data.

              Decryption transparently detects and decodes ASCII armoring.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--identity</b>=<u>PATH</u>
              Encrypt  to  the  <u>RECIPIENTS</u>  corresponding  to the <u>IDENTITIES</u> listed in the file at <u>PATH</u>. This is
              equivalent to converting the file at <u>PATH</u> to a recipients file with <b>age-keygen</b> <b>-y</b> and then passing
              that to <b>-R</b>/<b>--recipients-file</b>.

              For the format of <u>PATH</u>, see the definition of <b>-i</b>/<b>--identity</b> in the <u>Decryption</u> <u>options</u> section.

              <b>-e</b>/<b>--encrypt</b> must be explicitly specified when using <b>-i</b>/<b>--identity</b> in  encryption  mode  to  avoid
              confusion.

       <b>-j</b> <u>PLUGIN</u>
              Encrypt using the data-less <u>plugin</u> <u>PLUGIN</u>.

              This  is equivalent to using <b>-i</b>/<b>--identity</b> with a file that contains a single plugin <b>IDENTITY</b> that
              encodes no plugin-specific data.

              <b>-e</b>/<b>--encrypt</b> must be explicitly specified when using <b>-j</b> in encryption mode to avoid confusion.

   <b>Decryption</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-d</b>, <b>--decrypt</b>
              Decrypt <u>INPUT</u> to <u>OUTPUT</u>.

              If <u>INPUT</u> is passphrase encrypted, it will be automatically detected and  the  passphrase  will  be
              requested interactively. Otherwise, the <u>IDENTITIES</u> specified with <b>-i</b>/<b>--identity</b> are used.

              ASCII armoring is transparently detected and decoded.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--identity</b>=<u>PATH</u>
              Decrypt using the <u>IDENTITIES</u> at <u>PATH</u>.

              <u>PATH</u> may be one of the following:

              a.  A file listing <u>IDENTITIES</u> one per line. Empty lines and lines starting with "<b>#</b>" are ignored as
              comments.

              b. A passphrase encrypted age file, containing <u>IDENTITIES</u> one per line like above. The  passphrase
              is  requested  interactively.  Note that passphrase-protected identity files are not necessary for
              most use cases, where access to the encrypted identity file implies access to the whole system.

              c. An SSH private key file,  in  PKCS#1,  PKCS#8,  or  OpenSSH  format.  If  the  private  key  is
              password-protected,  the  password is requested interactively only if the SSH identity matches the
              file. See the <u>SSH</u> <u>keys</u> section for more information, including supported key types.

              d. "<b>-</b>", causing one of the options above to be read from standard input. In this case,  the  <u>INPUT</u>
              argument must be specified.

              This  option  can  be  repeated.  Identities are tried in the order in which are provided, and the
              first one matching one of the file's recipients is used. Unused identities are ignored, but it  is
              an error if the <u>INPUT</u> file is passphrase-encrypted and <b>-i</b>/<b>--identity</b> is specified.

       <b>-j</b> <u>PLUGIN</u>
              Decrypt using the data-less <u>plugin</u> <u>PLUGIN</u>.

              This  is equivalent to using <b>-i</b>/<b>--identity</b> with a file that contains a single plugin <b>IDENTITY</b> that
              encodes no plugin-specific data.

</pre><h4><b>RECIPIENTS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>IDENTITIES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>RECIPIENTS</b> are public values, like a public key, that a file can be encrypted to. <b>IDENTITIES</b> are  private
       values, like a private key, that allow decrypting a file encrypted to the corresponding <b>RECIPIENT</b>.

   <b>Native</b> <b>X25519</b> <b>keys</b>
       Native  <b>age</b> key pairs are generated with <a href="../man1/age-keygen.1.html">age-keygen</a>(1), and provide small encodings and strong encryption
       based on X25519. They are the recommended recipient type for most applications.

       A <b>RECIPIENT</b> encoding begins with <b>age1</b> and looks like the following:

           age1gde3ncmahlqd9gg50tanl99r960llztrhfapnmx853s4tjum03uqfssgdh

       An <b>IDENTITY</b> encoding begins with <b>AGE-SECRET-KEY-1</b> and looks like the following:

           AGE-SECRET-KEY-1KTYK6RVLN5TAPE7VF6FQQSKZ9HWWCDSKUGXXNUQDWZ7XXT5YK5LSF3UTKQ

       An encrypted file can't be linked to the native  recipient  it's  encrypted  to  without  access  to  the
       corresponding identity.

   <b>SSH</b> <b>keys</b>
       As a convenience feature, <b>age</b> also supports encrypting to RSA or Ed25519 <a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a>(1) keys. RSA keys must be at
       least  2048  bits.  This feature employs more complex cryptography, and should only be used when a native
       key is not available for the recipient. Note that SSH keys  might  not  be  protected  long-term  by  the
       recipient, since they are revokable when used only for authentication.

       A  <b>RECIPIENT</b> encoding is an SSH public key in <b>authorized_keys</b> format (see the <b>AUTHORIZED_KEYS</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b>
       section of <a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a>(8)), starting with <b>ssh-rsa</b> or <b>ssh-ed25519</b>, like the following:

           ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABgQDULTit0KUehbi[...]GU4BtElAbzh8=
           ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIH9pO5pz22JZEas[...]l1uZc31FGYMXa

       The comment at the end of the line, if present, is ignored.

       In recipient files passed to <b>-R</b>/<b>--recipients-file</b>, unsupported but valid SSH public keys are ignored with
       a warning, to facilitate using <b>authorized_keys</b> or GitHub <b>.keys</b> files. (See <u>EXAMPLES</u>.)

       An <b>IDENTITY</b> is an SSH private key <u>file</u> passed individually to  <b>-i</b>/<b>--identity</b>.  Note  that  keys  held  on
       hardware tokens such as YubiKeys or accessed via <a href="../man1/ssh-agent.1.html">ssh-agent</a>(1) are not supported.

       An  encrypted  file  <u>can</u>  be  linked  to  the SSH public key it was encrypted to. This is so that <b>age</b> can
       identify the correct SSH private key before requesting its password, if any.

   <b>Plugins</b>
       <b>age</b> can be extended through plugins. A plugin is only loaded if a corresponding <b>RECIPIENT</b> or <b>IDENTITY</b>  is
       specified.  (Simply  decrypting  a  file  encrypted with a plugin will not cause it to load, for security
       reasons among others.)

       A <b>RECIPIENT</b> for a  plugin  named  <b>example</b>  starts  with  <b>age1example1</b>,  while  an  <b>IDENTITY</b>  starts  with
       <b>AGE-PLUGIN-EXAMPLE-1</b>. They both encode arbitrary plugin-specific data, and are generated by the plugin.

       When  either is specified, <b>age</b> searches for <b>age-plugin-example</b> in the PATH and executes it to perform the
       file header encryption or decryption. The plugin may request input from the user through <b>age</b> to  complete
       the operation.

       Plugins can be freely mixed with other plugins or natively supported keys.

       A plugin is not bound to only encrypt or decrypt files meant for or generated by the plugin. For example,
       a  plugin  can be used to decrypt files encrypted to a native X25519 <b>RECIPIENT</b> or even with a passphrase.
       Similarly, a plugin can encrypt a file such that it can be decrypted without the use of any plugin.

       Plugins for which the <b>IDENTITY</b>/<b>RECIPIENT</b> distinction doesn't make sense (such as a  symmetric  encryption
       plugin)  may  generate only an <b>IDENTITY</b> and instruct the user to perform encryption with the <b>-e</b>/<b>--encrypt</b>
       and <b>-i</b>/<b>--identity</b> flags. Plugins for which the concept of separate identities doesn't make sense (such as
       a password-encryption plugin) may instruct the user to use the <b>-j</b> flag.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>age</b> will exit 0 if and only if encryption or decryption are successful for the full length of the input.

       If an error occurs during decryption, partial output might  still  be  generated,  but  only  if  it  was
       possible to securely authenticate it. No unauthenticated output is ever released.

</pre><h4><b>BACKWARDS</b> <b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Files  encrypted with a stable version (not alpha, beta, or release candidate) of <b>age</b>, or with any v1.0.0
       beta or release candidate, will decrypt with any later version of the tool.

       If decrypting older files poses a security risk, doing so might cause an error by default. In this  case,
       a flag will be provided to force the operation.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Generate a new identity, encrypt data, and decrypt:

           $ age-keygen -o key.txt
           Public key: age1ql3z7hjy54pw3hyww5ayyfg7zqgvc7w3j2elw8zmrj2kg5sfn9aqmcac8p

           $ tar cvz <a href="file:~/data">~/data</a> | age -r age1ql3z7hjy54pw3hyww5ayyfg7zqgvc7w3j2elw8zmrj2kg5sfn9aqmcac8p &gt; data.tar.gz.age

           $ age -d -o data.tar.gz -i key.txt data.tar.gz.age

       Encrypt <b>example.jpg</b> to multiple recipients and output to <b>example.jpg.age</b>:

           $ age -o example.jpg.age -r age1ql3z7hjy54pw3hyww5ayyfg7zqgvc7w3j2elw8zmrj2kg5sfn9aqmcac8p \
               -r age1lggyhqrw2nlhcxprm67z43rta597azn8gknawjehu9d9dl0jq3yqqvfafg example.jpg

       Encrypt to a list of recipients:

           $ cat &gt; recipients.txt
           # Alice
           age1ql3z7hjy54pw3hyww5ayyfg7zqgvc7w3j2elw8zmrj2kg5sfn9aqmcac8p
           # Bob
           age1lggyhqrw2nlhcxprm67z43rta597azn8gknawjehu9d9dl0jq3yqqvfafg

           $ age -R recipients.txt example.jpg &gt; example.jpg.age

       Encrypt and decrypt a file using a passphrase:

           $ age -p secrets.txt &gt; secrets.txt.age
           Enter passphrase (leave empty to autogenerate a secure one):
           Using the autogenerated passphrase "release-response-step-brand-wrap-ankle-pair-unusual-sword-train".

           $ age -d secrets.txt.age &gt; secrets.txt
           Enter passphrase:

       Encrypt and decrypt with a passphrase-protected identity file:

           $ age-keygen | age -p &gt; key.age
           Public key: age1yhm4gctwfmrpz87tdslm550wrx6m79y9f2hdzt0lndjnehwj0ukqrjpyx5
           Enter passphrase (leave empty to autogenerate a secure one):
           Using the autogenerated passphrase "hip-roast-boring-snake-mention-east-wasp-honey-input-actress".

           $ age -r age1yhm4gctwfmrpz87tdslm550wrx6m79y9f2hdzt0lndjnehwj0ukqrjpyx5 secrets.txt &gt; secrets.txt.age

           $ age -d -i key.age secrets.txt.age &gt; secrets.txt
           Enter passphrase for identity file "key.age":

       Encrypt and decrypt with an SSH public key:

           $ age -R <a href="file:~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub">~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub</a> example.jpg &gt; example.jpg.age

           $ age -d -i <a href="file:~/.ssh/id_ed25519">~/.ssh/id_ed25519</a> example.jpg.age &gt; example.jpg

       Encrypt and decrypt with age-plugin-yubikey:

           $ age-plugin-yubikey # run interactive setup, generate identity file and obtain recipient

           $ age -r age1yubikey1qwt50d05nh5vutpdzmlg5wn80xq5negm4uj9ghv0snvdd3yysf5yw3rhl3t secrets.txt &gt; secrets.txt.age

           $ age -d -i age-yubikey-identity-388178f3.txt secrets.txt.age

       Encrypt to the SSH keys of a GitHub user:

           $ curl https://github.com/benjojo.keys | age -R - example.jpg &gt; example.jpg.age
