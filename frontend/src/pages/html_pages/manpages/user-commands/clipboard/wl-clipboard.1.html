</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       wl-clipboard - Wayland copy and paste command line utilities

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wl-copy</b> [<b>--primary</b>] [<b>--type</b> <u>mime/type</u>] [<u>text</u>...]

       <b>wl-paste</b> [<b>--primary</b>] [<b>--type</b> <u>mime/type</u>]

       Only the most useful options are listed here; see below for the full list.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wl-copy</b>  copies  the  given <u>text</u> to the Wayland clipboard.  If no <u>text</u> is given, <b>wl-copy</b> copies data from
       its standard input.

       <b>wl-paste</b> pastes data from the Wayland clipboard to its standard output.

       Although <b>wl-copy</b> and <b>wl-paste</b> are particularly  optimized  for  plain  text  and  other  textual  content
       formats, they fully support content of arbitrary MIME types. <b>wl-copy</b> automatically infers the type of the
       copied content by running <b><a href="../man1/xdg-mime.1.html">xdg-mime</a></b>(1) on it. <b>wl-paste</b> tries its best to pick a type to paste based on the
       list  of offered MIME types and the extension of the file it's pasting into. If you're not satisfied with
       the type they pick or don't want to rely on this implicit type inference, you can explicitly specify  the
       type to use with the <b>--type</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       To  parse  options,  wl-clipboard  uses  the  <b><a href="../man3/getopt.3.html">getopt</a></b>(3)  library routines, whose features depend on the C
       library in use. In particular, it may be possible to specify <b>--</b> as an argument on its own to prevent  any
       further  arguments  from  getting parsed as options (which lets you copy text containing words that start
       with the <b>-</b> sign), and to shorten long options to their unambiguous prefixes.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--primary</b>
              Use the "primary" clipboard instead of the regular clipboard.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--paste-once</b> (for <b>wl-copy</b>)
              Only serve one paste request and then exit. Unless a clipboard manager  specifically  designed  to
              prevent this is in use, this has the effect of clearing the clipboard after the first paste, which
              is useful for copying sensitive data such as passwords. Note that this may break pasting into some
              clients  that  expect  to  be  able  to  paste multiple times, in particular pasting into XWayland
              windows is known to break when this option is used.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--foreground</b> (for <b>wl-copy</b>)
              By default, <b>wl-copy</b> forks and serves data requests in the background; this option  overrides  that
              behavior, causing <b>wl-copy</b> to run in the foreground.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--clear</b> (for <b>wl-copy</b>)
              Instead of copying anything, clear the clipboard so that nothing is copied.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--trim-newline</b> (for <b>wl-copy</b>)
              Do not copy the trailing newline character if it is present in the input file.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--no-newline</b> (for <b>wl-paste</b>)
              Do not append a newline character after the pasted clipboard content. This option is automatically
              enabled for non-text content types and when using the <b>--watch</b> mode.

       <b>-t</b> <u>mime/type</u>, <b>--type</b> <u>mime/type</u>
              Override the automatically selected MIME type. For <b>wl-copy</b> this option controls which type <b>wl-copy</b>
              will  offer  the  content  as.  For  <b>wl-paste</b> it controls which of the offered types <b>wl-paste</b> will
              request the content in. In addition to specific  MIME  types  such  as  <u>image/png</u>,  <b>wl-paste</b>  also
              accepts  generic  type  names such as <u>text</u> and <u>image</u> which make it automatically pick some offered
              MIME type that matches the given generic name.

       <b>-s</b> <u>seat-name</u>, <b>--seat</b> <u>seat-name</u>
              Specify which seat <b>wl-copy</b> and <b>wl-paste</b> should work with.  Wayland  natively  supports  multi-seat
              configurations  where each seat gets its own mouse pointer, keyboard focus, and among other things
              its own separate clipboard. The name  of  the  default  seat  is  likely  <u>default</u>  or  <u>seat0</u>,  and
              additional  seat names normally come from the <b><a href="../man7/udev.7.html">udev</a></b>(7) property <b>ENV{WL_SEAT}</b>. You can view the list
              of the currently available seats as advertised by the compositor using the <b><a href="../man1/weston-info.1.html">weston-info</a></b>(1) tool. If
              you don't specify the seat name explicitly, <b>wl-copy</b> and <b>wl-paste</b> will pick a seat arbitrarily.  If
              you are using a single-seat system, there is little reason to use this option.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--list-types</b> (for <b>wl-paste</b>)
              Instead of pasting the selection, output the list of MIME types it is offered in.

       <b>-w</b> <u>command</u>..., <b>--watch</b> <u>command</u>... (for <b>wl-paste</b>)
              Instead  of  pasting  once  and exiting, continuously watch the clipboard for changes, and run the
              specified <u>command</u> each time a new selection appears.  The spawned process can read  the  clipboard
              contents  from  its  standard  input.   <b>wl-paste</b>  also  sets  the  <b>CLIPBOARD_STATE</b> variable in the
              environment of the spawned processes (see below).

              This mode requires a compositor that supports the wlroots data-control protocol.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Display the version of wl-clipboard and some short info about its license.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Display a short help message listing the available options.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>WAYLAND_DISPLAY</b>
              Specifies what Wayland server <b>wl-copy</b> and <b>wl-paste</b> should connect to. This is the same environment
              variable that you pass to other Wayland clients, such as graphical applications, that  connect  to
              this  Wayland server. It is normally set up automatically by the graphical session and the Wayland
              compositor. See <b><a href="../man3/wl_display_connect.3.html">wl_display_connect</a></b>(3) for more details.

       <b>WAYLAND_DEBUG</b>
              When set to <b>1</b>, causes the <b><a href="../man7/wayland-client.7.html">wayland-client</a></b>(7) library to log every interaction <b>wl-copy</b> and  <b>wl-paste</b>
              make with the Wayland compositor to stderr.

       <b>CLIPBOARD_STATE</b>
              Set  by  <b>wl-paste</b> for the spawned command in <b>--watch</b> mode. Currently the following possible values
              are <u>defined</u>:

              CLIPBOARD_STATE=<b>data</b>
                     Indicates that the clipboard contains data that the  spawned  command  can  read  from  its
                     standard input. This is the most common case.

              CLIPBOARD_STATE=<b>nil</b>
                     Indicates  that  the  clipboard is empty. In this case the spawned command's standard input
                     will be attached to <u>/dev/null</u>. Note that  this  is  subtly  different  from  the  clipboard
                     containing  zero-sized  data  (which  can  be  achieved, for instance, by running <b>wl-copy</b> <b>&lt;</b>
                     <b>/dev/null</b>).

              CLIPBOARD_STATE=<b>clear</b>
                     Indicates that the clipboard is empty because of an explicit clear request, such  as  after
                     running  <b>wl-copy</b>  <b>--clear</b>.  As  for  <b>nil</b>,  the command's standard input will be attached to
                     <u>/dev/null</u>.

              CLIPBOARD_STATE=<b>sensitive</b>
                     Indicates that the clipboard contains sensitive data such as a password or  a  key.  It  is
                     probably best to avoid visibly displaying or persistently saving clipboard contents.

              Any  client  programs implementing the <b>CLIPBOARD_STATE</b> protocol are encouraged to implement proper
              support for all the values listed above, as well as to fall back  to  some  sensible  behavior  if
              <b>CLIPBOARD_STATE</b> is unset or set to some unrecognized value (this is to leave the design space open
              for  future extensions). However, the currently existing Wayland clipboard protocols don't let wl-
              clipboard identify the cases where <b>clear</b> and <b>sensitive</b> values should  be  set,  so  currently  wl-
              clipboard only ever sets <b>CLIPBOARD_STATE</b> to <b>data</b> or <b>nil</b>.

              The  <b>CLIPBOARD_STATE</b> protocol was intentionally designed to not be specific to either wl-clipboard
              or Wayland; in fact, other  clipboard  tools  are  encouraged  to  implement  the  same  protocol.
              Currently,  the  SerenityOS  <b><a href="../man1/paste.1.html">paste</a></b>(1)  utility  is  known  to  implement  the same <b>CLIPBOARD_STATE</b>
              protocol.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:/etc/mime.types">/etc/mime.types</a></u>
              If present, read by <b>wl-paste</b> to infer the MIME type to paste in based on the file  name  extension
              of its standard output.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Unless the Wayland compositor implements the wlroots data-control protocol, wl-clipboard has to resort to
       using a hack to access the clipboard: it will briefly pop up a tiny transparent surface (window). On some
       desktop environments (in particular when using tiling window managers), this can cause visual issues such
       as  brief  flashing.  In some cases the Wayland compositor doesn't give focus to the popup surface, which
       prevents wl-clipboard from accessing the clipboard and manifests as a hang.

       There is currently no way to copy data in multiple MIME types, such as multiple  image  formats,  at  the
       same time.
       See &lt;https://github.com/bugaevc/wl-clipboard/issues/71&gt;.

       wl-clipboard  is  not  always  able  to  detect that a MIME type is textual, which may break pasting into
       clients that expect textual formats, not <u>application/something</u>. The workaround, same as  for  all  format
       inference issues, is to specify the desired MIME type explicitly, such as <b>wl-copy</b> <b>--type</b> <u>text/plain</u>.

       <b>wl-copy</b>  <b>--clear</b>  and  <b>wl-copy</b>  <b>--paste-once</b>  don't always interact well with clipboard managers that are
       overeager to preserve clipboard contents.

       Applications written using the GTK 3 toolkit copy text with "\r\n" (also known as CR  LF)  line  endings,
       which  takes  most other software by surprise.  wl-cipboard does nothing to rectify this. The recommended
       workaround is piping <b>wl-paste</b> output through <b><a href="../man1/dos2unix.1.html">dos2unix</a></b>(1) when pasting from a GTK 3 application.
       See &lt;https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/issues/2307&gt;.

       When trying to paste content copied with <b>wl-copy</b>, <b>wl-copy</b> does not check whether the requested MIME  type
       is among those it has offered, and always provides the same data in response.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Copy a simple text message:
              $ <b>wl-copy</b> <u>Hello</u> <u>world!</u>

       Copy a message starting with dashes:
              <b>wl-copy</b> <b>--</b> <u>--long</u>

       Copy the list of files in <u><a href="file:~/Downloads">~/Downloads</a></u>:
              $ <u>ls</u> <u><a href="file:~/Downloads">~/Downloads</a></u> <b>|</b> <b>wl-copy</b>

       Copy an image:
              $ <b>wl-copy</b> <b>&lt;</b> <u><a href="file:~/Pictures/photo.png">~/Pictures/photo.png</a></u>

       Copy the previous command:
              $ <b>wl-copy</b> <b>"!!"</b>

       Paste to a file, without appending a newline:
              $ <b>wl-paste</b> <b>-n</b> <b>&gt;</b> <u>clipboard.txt</u>

       Sort clipboard contents:
              $ <b>wl-paste</b> <b>|</b> <b>sort</b> <b>|</b> <b>wl-copy</b>

       Upload clipboard contents to a pastebin on each change:
              $ <b>wl-paste</b> <b>--watch</b> <b>nc</b> <u>paste.example.org</u> <u>5555</u>
