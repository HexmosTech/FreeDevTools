</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       jstest-gtk - joystick testing and configuration tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>jstest-gtk</b> [<u>options</u>]<u>...</u>  [<u>device</u>]<u>...</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       jstest-gtk  is a simple joystick tester based on Gtk+. It provides a list of attached joysticks, a way to
       display which buttons and axis are pressed, a way to remap axis and buttons and a way to  calibrate  your
       joystick.

       Even  when your joystick is working mostly fine, you might want to give it a try, as the calibration lets
       you get rid of overlarge default deadzones that many joysticks use and then is a  noticeable  problem  in
       some games.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       jstest-gtk  is  mainly a graphical interface to check that your joysticks and pads work properly. You can
       find precise information on each axis, you can optionally recalibrate it and also change the mapping.

       If you run the program without parameters, you will get a window showing all the joystick devices in your
       system (there can be more than one). When you double click on one of them, you will get a new window with
       detailed information about its axes and buttons.

       There are two buttons in the detailed window called "Mapping"  adn  "Calibration",  that  allows  you  to
       reconfigurate the device.

       If  you  run  the  program  with  a  device as an argument (for example /dev/input/js0), you will get the
       detailed window for that device directly, without getting the whole list of joysticks in the system.

       Calibration of the axis consists in a simple window in which you set the values that go directly into the
       operative system configuration, without doing any changes on them. They're divided in range and dead zone
       (or center). In both of them you have to set a minimum and a  maximum.  You  also  have  a  checkbox  for
       inverting the axis.

       Values  are  changed  and  applied in the same instant that you modify them, there's no need for clicking
       anywhere or doing anything else for applying the changes.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with  long  options  starting  with  two  dashes
       (`-').
