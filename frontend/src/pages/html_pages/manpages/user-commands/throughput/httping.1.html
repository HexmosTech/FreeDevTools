</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The program <b>httping</b> lets you measure the latency of a webserver. Since version 1.0.6 also the  throughput
       can be measured.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-5</b>     The proxy server selected is a SOCKS5 server.

       <b>-6</b>     Enable IPv6 mode. Default is IPv4.

       <b>-a</b>     Audible ping

       <b>-b</b>     Use  this  switch  together  with  '-G'.  When this option is used, the transferspeed (in KB/s) is
              shown.

       <b>-B</b>     Use this switch together with '-G'. Ask the HTTP server to compress the returned data:  this  will
              reduce  the  influence  of  the bandwidth of your connection while increasing the influence of the
              processorpower of the HTTP server.

       <b>-c</b> <b>count</b>
              How many probes to send before exiting.

       <b>-D</b>     Do not draw graphs in ncurses mode (-K).

       <b>-e</b> <b>str</b> When the status-code differs from the ones selected with '-o', the given string is displayed.

       <b>-E</b>     Retrieve proxy settings from environment variables ('http_proxy' and 'https_proxy').

       <b>-F</b>     Attempt TCP Fast Open while trying to connect to a server (for Linux, version 3.7 onwards  of  the
              kernel)

       <b>-f</b>     Flood  ping:  do not sit idle between each ping but ping as fast as the computer and network allow
              you to.

       <b>-G</b>     Do a GET request instead of a HEAD request: this means that also the complete  page/file  must  be
              transferred. Note that in this case you're no longer measuring the latency!

       <b>-g</b> <b>url</b> This selects the url to probe. E.g.: <a href="http://localhost/">http://localhost/</a>

       <b>-h</b> <b>hostname</b>
              Instead of '-g' one can also set a hostname to probe with -h: -h localhost

       <b>-I</b> <b>str</b> UserAgent-string to send to the webserver (instead of 'HTTPing &lt;version&gt;').

       <b>-i</b> <b>interval</b>
              How many seconds to sleep between every probe sent.

       <b>-K</b>     Enable ncurses user interface.

       <b>-L</b> <b>x</b>   Use  this  switch  together with '-G'. Limit the amount of data transferred to 'x'. Note that this
              only affects the content of the page/file and not the headerdata.

       <b>-l</b>     Connect using SSL: for this to work you need to give a 'https'-url or a 443 portnumber.

       <b>-m</b>     Show machine readable output (also check '-o' and '-e').

       <b>-N</b> <b>x</b>   Switches HTTPing to Nagios-plugin mode 2: return 0 when everything  is  fine,  'x'  when  anything
              fails. E.g.: 1 =&gt; Nagios warning state, 2 =&gt; Nagios critical state.

       <b>-n</b> <b>warn,crit</b>
              Switches  HTTPing  to  Nagios-plugin mode 1: return exitcode '1' when the average response time is
              bigger then 'warn', return exitcode '2' when the the average response time is bigger then  'crit'.
              In all other cases return exitcode '0'.

       <b>-o</b> <b>x,x,...</b>
              This selects the HTTP status-codes which are regarded as an OK-state (only with '-m').

       <b>-p</b> <b>portnumber</b>
              -p can be used together with -h. -p selects the portnumber to probe.

       <b>-q</b>     Be quiet, only return an exit-code.

       <b>-R</b> <b>str</b> Referer-string to send to the webserver.

       <b>-Q</b>     Use  a  persistent  connection,  i.e.  reuse  the  same TCP connection for multiple HTTP requests.
              Usually possible when 'Connection: Keep-Alive' is sent by server. Adds a  'C'  to  the  output  if
              httping had to reconnect.

       <b>-r</b>     Only  resolve  the  hostname once: this takes the resolving out of the loop so that the latency of
              the DNS is not measured. Also useful when you want to measure  only  1  webserver  while  the  DNS
              returns a different ip-address for each resolve ('roundrobin').

       <b>-S</b>     Split measured latency in time to connect and time to exchange a request with the HTTP server.

       <b>-s</b>     When a successfull transaction was done, show the HTTP statuscode (200, 404, etc.).

       <b>-T</b> <b>x</b>   Read  the password for website authentication from file 'x' (instead of entering it on the command
              line).

       <b>-t</b> <b>timeout</b>
              How long to wait for answer from the other side.

       <b>-U</b>     Enable authentication against website. Set username with -U, set password with -P (or -T  to  read
              the password from a file).

       <b>-v</b>     Increase verbosity mode. To show standard deviation and dates in output.

       <b>-W</b>     Do not abort program if resolving fails.

       <b>-X</b>     Use this switch together with '-G'. For each "ping" show the amount of data transferred (excluding
              the headers).

       <b>-x</b> <b>proxyhost[:port]</b>
              Probe using a proxyserver. Note that you're also measuring the latency of the proxyserver!

       <b>-Y</b>     Enable colors

       <b>-z</b>     When connecting using SSL, display the fingerprint of the X509 certificate(s) of the peer.

       <b>--abbreviate</b>
              Abbreviate values bigger than thousand, million, billion, etc.

       <b>--adaptive-interval</b> <b>or</b> <b>--ai</b>
              (Try  to)  ping  on the same interval. E.g. if interval is set to 1.0 seconds and ping a ping t[n]
              occurs at 500s with duration 250ms, then the next ping (t[n+1]) will happen at 501 seconds and not
              at 501.25 seconds. Of course when the ping duration is &gt; bigger than the interval, a ping will  be
              "skipped"  (not  literally:  the  sequence number will continue) and t[n+1] will then be e.g. 502s
              instead of the expected 501s. This is useful for example in the ncurses output mode where  an  fft
              is calculated over the ping times.

       <b>--aggregates</b> <b>x[,y[,z[,etc.]]]</b>
              Show aggregates every x[/y[/z[<a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>]]] seconds.

       <b>--divert-connect</b> <b>x</b>
              Ignore the hostname in the URL and connect to 'x' instead. The given URL will be requested at 'x'.

       <b>--draw-phase</b>
              Not only draw the magnitude of the fourier transform, draw the phase as well.

       <b>--graph-limit</b> <b>x</b>
              If values measured are bigger than x, then they're limitted to x.

       <b>--header</b> <b>x</b>
              Add an additional request-header 'x'.

       <b>--keep-cookies</b>
              When the server sends a cookie, it will be returned in the next request.

       <b>--max-mtu</b> <b>x</b>
              Maximum MTU to use. Cannot be larger than network interface MTU.

       <b>--no-host-header</b>
              Do not put a "Host:"-header in the request header.

       <b>--no-tcp-nodelay</b>
              Do not disable "tcp delay" (Naggle).

       <b>--priority</b> <b>x</b>
              Set priority of packets.

       <b>--tos</b> <b>x</b>
              Set type of service.

       <b>--proxy-user</b> <b>x</b>
              Use username 'x' to authenticate against proxy (http/socks5) server (optional).

       <b>--proxy-password</b> <b>x</b>
              Use password 'x' to authenticate against proxy (http/socks5) server (optional).

       <b>--proxy-password-file</b> <b>x</b>
              Read password from file 'x' to authenticate against proxy (http/socks5) server (optional).

       <b>--recv-buffer</b> <b>x</b>
              Set the size of the receive buffer (in bytes).

       <b>--slow-log</b> <b>x</b>
              When the duration is x or more, show ping line in the slow log window (the middle window).

       <b>--threshold-red</b> <b>x</b>
              If the measured threshold is higher than x (and -Y is given), then the shown value is colored red.
              If you also use --threshold-yellow, then this value must be bigger.

       <b>--threshold-yellow</b> <b>x</b>
              If  the  measured  threshold  is  higher than x (and -Y is given), then the shown value is colored
              yellow.

       <b>--threshold-show</b> <b>x</b>
              If the measured threshold is higher than x, then the result is shown (default is show always). The
              value x is in ms.

       <b>--timestamp</b> <b>or</b> <b>--ts</b>
              Put a timestamp before the result-lines. Use -v to also show a date.

       <b>--tx-buffer</b> <b>x</b>
              Set the size of the transmit buffer (in bytes).

       <b>-V</b>     Show the version and exit.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       In split mode (-S) something like "time=0.08+24.09+23.17+15.64+0.02=62.98 ms" is shown. The  first  value
       is  the  time  it took to resolve the hostname (or 'n/a' if it did not resolve in this iteration, e.g. in
       "resolve once" (-r) mode), then the time it took to connect (or -1 for example in  persistent  connection
       (-Q,  HTTP  v1.1),  after that the time it took to put the request on the wire, then the time it took for
       the HTTP server to process the request and send it back  and  lastly  the  time  it  took  to  close  the
       connection.

</pre><h4><b>GRAPH</b></h4><pre>
       The  graph  in  the  ncurses uses colors to encode a meaning. Green: value is less than 1 block. Red: the
       value did not fit in the graph. Blue: the value was limitted by --graph-limit. Cyan: no  measurement  for
       that point in time.

</pre><h4><b>KEYS</b></h4><pre>
       Press  &lt;CTRL&gt;  + &lt;c&gt; to exit the program. It will display a summary of what was measured.  In the ncurses
       gui, press &lt;CTRL&gt; + &lt;l&gt; to forcibly redraw the screen. Press  'H'  to  halt  the  graphs  (and  again  to
       continue). Press 'q' to stop the program (&lt;CTRL&gt; + &lt;c&gt; will work too).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>httping</b> <b>-g</b> <b><a href="http://localhost/">http://localhost/</a></b>
              Ping the webserver on host 'localhost'.

       <b>httping</b> <b>-h</b> <b>localhost</b> <b>-p</b> <b>1000</b>
              Ping the webserver on host 'localhost' and portnumber 1000.

       <b>httping</b> <b>-l</b> <b>-g</b> <b>https://localhost/</b>
              Ping the webserver on host 'localhost' using an SSL connection.

       <b>httping</b> <b>-g</b> <b><a href="http://localhost/">http://localhost/</a></b> <b>-U</b> <b>username</b> <b>-P</b> <b>password</b>
              Ping the webserver on host 'localhost' using the Basic HTTP Authentication.
