</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       openipmi_eventd - An IPMI event handler

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>openipmi_eventd</b> <b>&lt;domain</b> <b>name&gt;</b> <b>&lt;connection</b> <b>parms&gt;</b> <b>&lt;options&gt;</b> <b>&lt;program&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;parm1&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;parm2&gt;</b> <b>[...]]]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>openipmi_eventd</b>  program  listens for IPMI events for the given connection and sends them to another
       program to process, or to a file.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>&lt;domain</b> <b>name&gt;</b>
              The name to use for the OpenIPMI domain.  This will appear in logs and some names.

       <b>&lt;connection</b> <b>parms&gt;</b>
              The parameters for the connection depend on the connection  type.   These  are  all  described  in
              openipmi_conparms (7)

       <b>&lt;options&gt;</b>
              Zero or more of the options defined in OPTIONS below.

       <b>&lt;program&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;parm1&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;parm2&gt;</b> <b>[...]]]</b>
              The  program  to run.  This must be the full path to the program.  Any given parameters are passed
              to the program before any IPMI parameters.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-f</b> filename, <b>--outfile</b> filename
              Send all events to the given file

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--exec-now</b>
              Immediately spawn the given program and send the event  information  to  that  program's  standard
              input.  The program should not quit, if it does then this program will exit with an error.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--event-stdin</b>
              Send the event information to the program's standard input instead of the commandline.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--delete-events</b>
              Delete  events  from  the  SEL  (System  Event  Log) once they have been processed.  Note that the
              program has to have handled the event without error for the event to be  deleted.   Otherwise  the
              events are not deleted from the SEL.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--dont-daemonize</b>
              Do not daemonize the program, run it as a foreground process.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--debug</b>
              Debug  the  program,  turn  on  output,  send  all logs to stderr, and do not run the process as a
              daemon.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       When started, this program will connect to the given IPMI domain, ignore all existing logs, and set up to
       listen from logs from all sources.  When an event comes in, it will handle the event depending on how  it
       is configured.

       By  default  the  program  will  be  called on each log and the event information passed on the program's
       command line. The first parameter (after the ones given on the <b>openipmi_eventd</b> command line) will be  the
       event type, the rest are key-value pairs as defined below.

       If  <b>-i</b>  is  given on the commandline, instead of passing in the event information on the command line, it
       will be passed into the program's standard input.  The first line will be the event type, and  each  line
       will have a key-value pair up until the last line, which will be <b>endevent.</b>

       If  <b>-k</b>  is given on the command line, the program will be started immediately and expected to take events
       on its standard input as they come in.  Each event will start  with  an  event  type,  contain  key-value
       pairs, and end in <b>endevent.</b>

</pre><h4><b>EVENT</b> <b>KEY-VALUE</b> <b>PAIRS</b></h4><pre>
       The  first  line  and  parameter  of  an event is always the event type (either <b>threshold</b> , <b>discrete</b> , or
       <b>unknown</b> ).  Then the following then the following, in no particular order.  When sending to  a  file,  or
       another program via standard input, <b>endevent</b> will mark the end of an event.

              assert true|false
                     If  true, the event is being asserted (the alarm present).  If false, the alarm was present
                     but has now gone away.

              eventtype &lt;num&gt;
                     The event type, per the IPMI specification.

              eventtime &lt;num&gt;
                     The time (in seconds) for the IPMI event.  It is 64 bits.

              eventdata &lt;vals&gt;
                     The raw event data, vals is a list of hex numbers.

              id &lt;name&gt;
                     The    OpenIPMI    id    of     the     sensor.      This     is     in     the     format:
                     <b>&lt;entity_id&gt;.&lt;entity_instance&gt;.&lt;sensor_name&gt;</b>  where  the entity id and instance identify the
                     object being monitored and the sensor names comes from the sensor.  Only for  discrete  and
                     threshold events.

              val &lt;floatnum&gt;
                     The sensor value that cause the event, in floating point format.  Optional and only present
                     for threshold sensors.

              raw &lt;hexnum&gt;
                     The  sensor value that cause the event, in raw (hex) format.  Optional and only present for
                     threshold sensors.

              off &lt;num&gt;
                     The bit in the sensor that caused the event, only present for discrete sensors.

              severity
                     The severity of the event.  For discrete sensors this optional and is a  number  between  0
                     and  14.   Them meaning depends on the specific sensor type.  For threshold sensors this is
                     one of:

                     lower_non_critical

                     lower_critical

                     lower_non_recoverable

                     upper_non_critical

                     upper_critical

                     upper_non_recoverable

              prevseverity
                     for discrete sensors.

              direction
                     The direction of the  event,  only  for  threshold  sensors.   This  can  be  difficult  to
                     understand  and  is not consistent on IPMI systems.  The IPMI specifiation does define what
                     this means.  For instance, what does an assertion of an upper critcal event going low mean?
