       lift.yaml - Define a Lift test suite

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Lift  provides  an  integration/functional  test  platform  which  handle  <b>executable</b>  tests  easily  and
       generically.

       <u>lift.yaml</u> files are used to define a test suite.  Such a file is written in YAML (  &lt;<a href="http://yaml.org/">http://yaml.org/</a>&gt;  )
       and  support  3 root sections types: <b>settings</b>, <b>local</b> <b>tests</b> and <b>remote</b> <b>tests</b>. These are documented further
       below in this documentation.

       A Lift test suite is composed of at least one <u>lift.yaml</u> file but it is often a folder hierarchy with  one
       <u>lift.yaml</u> file at each level.

       Such  a hierarchy is useful to define more specialized sub-suites (eg. one for basic functionalities, one
       for performances...). Each sub-suite has its own <u>lift.yaml</u> and can be run individually.

       Settings defined on a <u>lift.yaml</u> file are inherited in  sub-suites.   Sub-suites  can  override  inherited
       settings if they need to.

</pre><h4><b>SETTINGS</b> <b>DEFINITION</b></h4><pre>
       This  section  is  used  to  define  remotes  machines  that  will be used for remote tests and to define
       environment variables that will be passed to tests.

       Environment variables can be overridden for each test individually in their definition.

       The 'settings' section has to be defined at the root of the <u>lift.yaml</u> file.

          settings:
              # The 'define' keyword followed by the remote name
              define my_remote:
                  host: localhost  # mandatory
                  username: root  # mandatory
                  password: foobar  # optional (if ssh keys are set properly)
              define my_other_remote:
                  host: localhost
                  username: not_root
                  password: foobar
              # These will be transmitted to the test commands
              # They can be used as a way to pass common settings around
              environment:
                  MY_ENV_VAR1: foo
                  MY_ENV_VAR2: bar

</pre><h4><b>LOCAL</b> <b>TEST</b> <b>DEFINITION</b></h4><pre>
       Each test is represented by a single section at the root of the <u>lift.yaml</u> file. Here is an example:

          # the 'test' keyword followed by the test name
          test my_test_name:
              command: "./my_test_executable --my-arg"  # mandatory
              return code: 0  # optional (default to 0)
              timeout: 10  # optional, in seconds (no timeout by default)
              environment:  # optional
                  MY_VAR: 42  # may override an already defined variable

       If a test timeouts, it will return 124. You can therefore test that a command does timeout by setting the
       'return code' value to 124.

       The actual environment used by a test is computed in the following order: environment defined  in  higher
       level  <u>lift.yaml</u>  files  (inheritance),  then  the  environment defined in the current <u>lift.yaml</u> file and
       finally the environment defined in the test itself.

       The 'command' can be an absolute path, a path relative to the current  <u>lift.yaml</u>  position  or  a  system
       command (like ping, curl...)

</pre><h4><b>REMOTE</b> <b>TEST</b> <b>DEFINITION</b></h4><pre>
       Each remote test is represented by a single section at the root of the <u>lift.yaml</u> file.  Please also refer
       to  the  local test definition documentation, as all options are reused in the same way for remote tests.
       Here is an example:

          # A known remote name followed by the 'test' keyword and the test name
          # This defines a test that will be ran on my_remote.
          my_remote test my_remote_test_name:
              command: "sh test/test.sh --my-arg"
              return code: 0
              timeout: 2
              # List files and folders that will be uploaded to the remote
              # before running the test.
              resources:
                  - test/
              environment:
                  MY_VAR: content

       To be known, a remote has to be defined either in a higher level <u>lift.yaml</u> file (inheritance) or  in  the
       current <u>lift.yaml</u> or directly via the <b>--remote</b> option of the <b>lift</b> command line.

       Files  resources  are  uploaded  "flatly"  whereas  folders keep their structure.  Lift will take care of
       deleting all resources from the remote after the test is over.

       The command will be executed in a temporary directory that will be created on the remote. Resources  will
       be put in this directory, so you can use relative paths to them in your command/executable.

</pre><h4><b>FULL</b> <b>TEST</b> <b>SUITE</b> <b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>example</u>  folder  at  the  root of the Lift sources contains a fully commented example of a Lift test
       suite, which can also be used as a functional test suite for Lift itself.

       On Debian systems, the <u>example</u> folder can be found in <u>/usr/share/doc/lift/example</u>.
