</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       GNOME Keysign is a tool for signing OpenPGP keys.

       Its  purpose is to ease signing other peoples' keys. It is similar to caff, PIUS, or monkeysign. In fact,
       it is influenced a lot by these tools and either reimplements ideas or reuses code.  Consider  either  of
       the above mentioned tools when you need a much more mature codebase.

       In  contrast  to caff or monkeysign, this tool enables you to sign a key without contacting a key server.
       It downloads an authenticated copy of the key from the other party. For now, the key is authenticated  by
       its  fingerprint  which  is  securely  transferred  via  a  QR code. Alternatively, the user may type the
       fingerprint manually, assuming that it has been transferred securely via the audible channel.

       After having obtained an authentic copy of the  key,  its  UIDs  are  signed.  The  signatures  are  then
       encrypted  and  sent via email. In contrast to monkeysign, xdg-email is used to pop up a pre-filled email
       composer windows of the mail client the user has configured to use. This greatly reduces complexity as no
       SMTP configuration needs to be obtained and gives the user a well known interface.
