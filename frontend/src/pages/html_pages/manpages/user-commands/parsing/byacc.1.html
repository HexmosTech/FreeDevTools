</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       byacc - an <a href="../man1/LALR.1.html">LALR</a>(1) parser generator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>byacc</b>  <b>[</b>  <b>-BdghilLPrtvVy</b> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <b>-b</b> <u>file_prefix</u> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <b>-H</b> <u>defines_file</u> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <b>-o</b> <u>output_file</u> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <b>-p</b> <u>symbol_prefix</u> <b>]</b>
       <u>filename</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Byacc</b> reads the grammar specification in the file <u>filename</u> and generates an <a href="../man1/LALR.1.html">LALR</a>(1) parser for  it.   The
       parsers  consist  of  a  set  of <a href="../man1/LALR.1.html">LALR</a>(1) parsing tables and a driver routine written in the C programming
       language.  <b>Byacc</b> normally writes the parse tables and the driver routine to the file <u>y.tab.c</u>.

       The following options are available:

       <b>-b</b> <u>file_prefix</u>
            The <b>-b</b> option changes the prefix prepended to the  output  file  names  to  the  string  denoted  by
            <u>file_prefix</u>.  The default prefix is the character <u>y</u>.

       <b>-B</b>   create a backtracking parser (compile-time configuration for <b>btyacc</b>).

       <b>-d</b>   causes the header file <b>y.tab.h</b> to be written.  It contains #define's for the token identifiers.

       <b>-h</b>   print a usage message to the standard error.

       <b>-H</b> <u>defines_file</u>
            causes  #define's  for the token identifiers to be written to the given <u>defines_file</u> rather than the
            <b>y.tab.h</b> file used by the <b>-d</b> option.

       <b>-g</b>   The <b>-g</b> option causes a graphical description of the generated <a href="../man1/LALR.1.html">LALR</a>(1) parser to be  written  to  the
            file <b>y.dot</b> in graphviz format, ready to be processed by <b><a href="../man1/dot.1.html">dot</a></b>(1).

       <b>-i</b>   The  <b>-i</b>  option  causes  a  supplementary  header  file  <b>y.tab.i</b>  to be written.  It contains extern
            declarations and supplementary #define's as needed to map the conventional <u>yacc</u> <b>yy</b>-prefixed names to
            whatever the <b>-p</b> option may specify.  The code file, e.g., <b>y.tab.c</b> is modified to #include this  file
            as well as the <b>y.tab.h</b> file, enforcing consistent usage of the symbols defined in those files.

            The supplementary header file makes it simpler to separate compilation of lex- and yacc-files.

       <b>-l</b>   If  the  <b>-l</b>  option is not specified, <b>byacc</b> will insert <u>#line</u> directives in the generated code.  The
            <u>#line</u> directives let the C compiler relate errors in the generated code to the user's original code.
            If the <b>-l</b> option is specified, <b>byacc</b>  will  not  insert  the  <u>#line</u>  directives.   <u>#line</u>  directives
            specified by the user will be retained.

       <b>-L</b>   enable position processing, e.g., “%locations” (compile-time configuration for <b>btyacc</b>).

       <b>-o</b> <u>output_file</u>
            specify  the  filename for the parser file.  If this option is not given, the output filename is the
            file prefix concatenated with the file suffix, e.g., <b>y.tab.c</b>.  This overrides the <b>-b</b> option.

       <b>-p</b> <u>symbol_prefix</u>
            The <b>-p</b> option changes the prefix prepended to  yacc-generated  symbols  to  the  string  denoted  by
            <u>symbol_prefix</u>.  The default prefix is the string <b>yy.</b>

       <b>-P</b>   create a reentrant parser, e.g., “%pure-parser”.

       <b>-r</b>   The  <b>-r</b>  option  causes <b>byacc</b> to produce separate files for code and tables.  The code file is named
            <u>y.code.c</u>, and the tables file is named <u>y.tab.c</u>.  The prefix “<u>y.</u>” can  be  overridden  using  the  <b>-b</b>
            option.

       <b>-s</b>   suppress “<b>#define</b>” statements generated for string literals in a “<b>%token</b>” statement, to more closely
            match original <b>yacc</b> behavior.

            Normally when <b>byacc</b> sees a line such as

              %token OP_ADD "ADD"

            it  notices  that  the  quoted  “ADD”  is a valid C identifier, and generates a #define not only for
            OP_ADD, but for ADD as well, e.g.,

              #define OP_ADD 257
              #define ADD 258

            The original <b>yacc</b> does not generate the second “<b>#define</b>”.  The <b>-s</b> option suppresses this “<b>#define</b>”.

            POSIX (IEEE 1003.1 2004) documents only names and numbers for “<b>%token</b>”,  though  original  <b>yacc</b>  and
            bison also accept string literals.

       <b>-t</b>   The  <b>-t</b>  option  changes the preprocessor directives generated by <b>byacc</b> so that debugging statements
            will be incorporated in the compiled code.

            <b>Byacc</b> sends debugging output to the standard output (compatible with  both  the  original  <b>yacc</b>  and
            <b>btyacc</b>), while <b>btyacc</b> writes debugging output to the standard error (like <b>bison</b>).

       <b>-v</b>   The  <b>-v</b> option causes a human-readable description of the generated parser to be written to the file
            <u>y.output</u>.

       <b>-V</b>   print the version number to the standard output.

       <b>-y</b>   <b>byacc</b> ignores this option, which bison supports for ostensible POSIX compatibility.

       The <u>filename</u> parameter is not optional.  However, <b>byacc</b> accepts a single “-” to read the grammar from the
       standard input.  A double “--” marker denotes the  end  of  options.   A  single  <u>filename</u>  parameter  is
       expected after a “--” marker.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       If  there  are  rules that are never reduced, the number of such rules is reported on standard error.  If
       there are any <a href="../man1/LALR.1.html">LALR</a>(1) conflicts, the number of conflicts is reported on standard error.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Byacc</b> provides some extensions for compatibility with  bison  and  other  implementations  of  yacc.   It
       accepts  several  <u>long</u>  <u>options</u> which have equivalents in byacc.  The <b>%destructor</b> and <b>%locations</b> features
       are available only if <b>byacc</b> has been configured  and  compiled  to  support  the  back-tracking  (<b>btyacc</b>)
       functionality.  The remaining features are always available:

        <b>%code</b> <u>keyword</u> { <u>code</u> }
              Adds  the  indicated  source <u>code</u> at a given point in the output file.  The optional <u>keyword</u> tells
              <b>byacc</b> where to insert the <u>code</u>:

              <b>top</b>  just after the version-definition in the generated code-file.

              <b>requires</b>
                   just after the declaration of public parser variables.  If the <b>-d</b> option is given,  the  code
                   is inserted at the beginning of the defines-file.

              <b>provides</b>
                   just  after the declaration of private parser variables.  If the <b>-d</b> option is given, the code
                   is inserted at the end of the defines-file.

              If no <u>keyword</u> is given, the code is inserted at the  beginning  of  the  section  of  code  copied
              verbatim  from  the source file.  Multiple <b>%code</b> directives may be given; <b>byacc</b> inserts those into
              the corresponding code- or defines-file in the order that they appear in the source file.

        <b>%debug</b>
              This has the same effect as the “-t” command-line option.

        <b>%destructor</b> { <u>code</u> } <u>symbol+</u>
              defines code that is invoked when a symbol is automatically discarded during error recovery.  This
              code can be used to  reclaim  dynamically  allocated  memory  associated  with  the  corresponding
              semantic value for cases where user actions cannot manage the memory explicitly.

              On encountering a parse error, the generated parser discards symbols on the stack and input tokens
              until  it  reaches  a  state  that  will  allow parsing to continue.  This error recovery approach
              results in a memory leak if the <b>YYSTYPE</b> value is, or contains, pointers to  dynamically  allocated
              memory.

              The  bracketed <u>code</u> is invoked whenever the parser discards one of the symbols.  Within <u>code</u>, “<b>$$</b>”
              or “<b>$&lt;</b><u>tag</u><b>&gt;$</b>” designates the  semantic  value  associated  with  the  discarded  symbol,  and  “<b>@$</b>”
              designates its location (see <b>%locations</b> directive).

              A  per-symbol destructor is defined by listing a grammar symbol in <u>symbol+</u>.  A per-type destructor
              is defined by listing a semantic type tag (e.g., “&lt;some_tag&gt;”)  in  <u>symbol+</u>;  in  this  case,  the
              parser  will  invoke <u>code</u> whenever it discards any grammar symbol that has that semantic type tag,
              unless that symbol has its own per-symbol destructor.

              Two categories of default destructor are supported that are invoked when  discarding  any  grammar
              symbol that has no per-symbol and no per-type destructor:

              •   the  code for “<b>&lt;*&gt;</b>” is used for grammar symbols that have an explicitly declared semantic type
                  tag (via “<b>%type</b>”);

              •   the code for “<b>&lt;&gt;</b>” is used for grammar symbols that have no declared semantic type tag.

        <b>%empty</b>
              ignored by <b>byacc</b>.

        <b>%expect</b> <u>number</u>
              tells <b>byacc</b> the expected number of shift/reduce conflicts.  That makes it only report  the  number
              if it differs.

        <b>%expect-rr</b> <u>number</u>
              tell  <b>byacc</b>  the expected number of reduce/reduce conflicts.  That makes it only report the number
              if it differs.  This is (unlike bison) allowable in LALR parsers.

        <b>%locations</b>
              tells <b>byacc</b> to enable management of position information associated with each token,  provided  by
              the  lexer  in  the  global  variable  <b>yylloc</b>, similar to management of semantic value information
              provided in <b>yylval</b>.

              As for semantic values, locations can be referenced within  actions  using  <b>@$</b>  to  refer  to  the
              location  of  the  left hand side symbol, and <b>@</b><u>N</u> (<u>N</u> an integer) to refer to the location of one of
              the right hand side symbols.  Also as for semantic values, when  a  rule  is  matched,  a  default
              action is used the compute the location represented by <b>@$</b> as the beginning of the first symbol and
              the  end  of  the last symbol in the right hand side of the rule.  This default computation can be
              overridden by explicit assignment to <b>@$</b> in a rule action.

              The type of <b>yylloc</b> is <b>YYLTYPE</b>, which is defined by default as:

              typedef struct YYLTYPE {
                  int first_line;
                  int first_column;
                  int last_line;
                  int last_column;
              } YYLTYPE;

              <b>YYLTYPE</b> can be redefined by the user (<b>YYLTYPE_IS_DEFINED</b> must be defined, to inhibit the  default)
              in  the  declarations section of the specification file.  As in bison, the macro <b>YYLLOC_DEFAULT</b> is
              invoked each time a rule is matched to calculate a position for the left hand side  of  the  rule,
              before the associated action is executed; this macro can be redefined by the user.

              This directive adds a <b>YYLTYPE</b> parameter to <b>yyerror()</b>.  If the <b>%pure-parser</b> directive is present, a
              <b>YYLTYPE</b> parameter is added to <b>yylex()</b> calls.

        <b>%lex-param</b> { <u>argument-declaration</u> }
              By  default,  the lexer accepts no parameters, e.g., <b>yylex()</b>.  Use this directive to add parameter
              declarations for your customized lexer.

        <b>%parse-param</b> { <u>argument-declaration</u> }
              By default, the parser accepts  no  parameters,  e.g.,  <b>yyparse()</b>.   Use  this  directive  to  add
              parameter declarations for your customized parser.

        <b>%pure-parser</b>
              Most  variables (other than <b>yydebug</b> and <b>yynerrs</b>) are allocated on the stack within <b>yyparse</b>, making
              the parser reasonably reentrant.

        <b>%token-table</b>
              Make the parser's names for tokens available in  the  <b>yytname</b>  array.   However,  <b>byacc</b>  does  not
              predefine “$end”, “$error” or “$undefined” in this array.

</pre><h4><b>PORTABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       According to Robert Corbett,

              Berkeley Yacc is an <a href="../man1/LALR.1.html">LALR</a>(1) parser generator.  Berkeley Yacc
              has been made as compatible as possible with AT&amp;T Yacc.
              Berkeley Yacc can accept any input specification that
              conforms to the AT&amp;T Yacc documentation.  Specifications
              that take advantage of undocumented features of AT&amp;T Yacc
              will probably be rejected.

       The rationale in

              <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/yacc.html">http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/yacc.html</a>

       documents some features of AT&amp;T yacc which are no longer required for POSIX compliance.

       That  said,  you  may  be interested in reusing grammar files with some other implementation which is not
       strictly compatible with AT&amp;T yacc.  For instance, there is bison.  Here are a few differences:

       •   <b>Yacc</b> accepts an equals mark preceding the left curly brace of an action (as in the  original  grammar
           file <b>ftp.y</b>):

                  |   STAT CRLF
                      = {
                              statcmd();
                      }

       •   <b>Yacc</b>  and  bison  emit  code  in  different order, and in particular bison makes forward reference to
           common functions such as yylex, yyparse and yyerror without providing prototypes.

       •   Bison's support for “%expect” is broken in more than one release.   For  best  results  using  bison,
           delete that directive.

       •   Bison  has  no equivalent for some of <b>byacc</b>'s command-line options, relying on directives embedded in
           the grammar file.

       •   Bison's “<b>-y</b>” option does not affect bison's lack of support for features  of  AT&amp;T  yacc  which  were
           deemed obsolescent.

       •   <b>Yacc</b> accepts multiple parameters with <b>%lex-param</b> and <b>%parse-param</b> in two forms

              {type1 name1} {type2 name2} ...
              {type1 name1,  type2 name2 ...}

           Bison accepts the latter (though undocumented), but depending on the release may generate bad code.

       •   Like  bison,  <b>byacc</b>  will  add  parameters  specified  via  <b>%parse-param</b>  to <b>yyparse</b>, <b>yyerror</b> and (if
           configured for  back-tracking)  to  the  destructor  declared  using  <b>%destructor</b>.   Bison  puts  the
           additional  parameters  <u>first</u>  for  <b>yyparse</b>  and <b>yyerror</b> but <u>last</u> for destructors.  <b>Yacc</b> matches this
           behavior.
