</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tiptop - display hardware performance counters for Linux tasks

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tiptop</b> [OPTION]

       <b>tiptop</b> [OPTION] -- command  (EXPERIMENTAL)

       <b>ptiptop</b> PATTERN [OPTIONS]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>tiptop</b>  program provides a dynamic real-time view of the tasks running in the system. tiptop is very
       similar to top (1), but the information displayed comes from hardware counters.

       tiptop has two running <u>modes</u>: live-mode and batch-mode. In both modes, the system is periodically queried
       for the values of hardware counters, and various ratios are printed for  each  task.  In  live-mode,  the
       display  is  regularly  updated  with  new  values  at  constant  time intervals. In batch-mode, the same
       information is emitted to stdout. Batch-mode  is  appropriate  for  saving  to  a  file  or  for  further
       processing. No interaction is possible in batch-mode.

       Unless  tiptop  is  run  by  root, or the executable is setuid-root, a user can only monitor the tasks it
       owns.

       The results produced by tiptop are organized in <u>screens</u>. A screen consists in  rows  representing  tasks,
       and  columns  reporting  various  values and ratios collected from hardware counters. Many screens can be
       defined. Only one screen is displayed at a time. The default screen (number 0) reports target independent
       values as defined in the file /usr/include/linux/event_counter.h.  Other  screens  may  rely  on  target-
       dependent counters.

       When  an expression would result in a division by zero, a '-' sign is printed. When a counter involved in
       an expression could not be read, a '?' sign is printed.

       If -- appears in the command line, tiptop treats the rest of the line as a  command.  A  new  process  is
       forked,  and hardware counters are attached just before execvp is called. This makes it possible to trace
       an application from the first instruction. Only the child is traced, and idle-mode is  enabled  (in  live
       mode,  this  can  be  overridden by hitting keys 'p' and 'i').  This is commonly used in combination with
       sticky mode to track a command from start to finish. This is experimental!

       ptiptop is simply a shortcut for tiptop -p.

       tiptop requires Linux 2.6.31+.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND-LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Command line options with a parameter override values specified in the configuration  file.  Toggles  set
       the value or invert the value read in the configuration file (if any).

       -<b>b</b>  Start  tiptop in batch-mode. Output is sent to stdout, and no interactive command is accepted. tiptop
           will run forever, or until the number of iterations specified by <b>-n</b>.

       -<b>c</b>  display the command line of the task instead of its name. (toggle)

       --<b>cpu-min</b> VALUE
           %CPU activity threshold. Below this value, a task is considered
            idle and is not reported (unless idle-mode is on, see flag -i).

       -<b>d</b> VALUE
           Specify the delay between refreshes. VALUE can be fractional. It must be larger than 0.01.

       -<b>E</b> FILENAME
           Specify file where errors are logged. By default errors are logged to stderr  in  batch-mode,  and  a
           temporary file in live-mode.

       --<b>epoch</b>
           Print  the Epoch at each refresh. In batch-mode, it is printed at the beginning of each row. In live-
           mode, it is at the bottom of the display. (toggle)

       -<b>h</b> <b>--help</b>
           Print a brief help message and exit.

       -<b>H</b>  Show threads. (toggle)

       -<b>i</b>  Show idle tasks. (toggle)

       -<b>K</b> <b>--kernel</b>
           Include kernel activity in the reported values. This is only possible is the user is root, the tiptop
           executable is setuid root, or the paranoia level is low enough. (toggle)
           See file <a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid">/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid</a>
           (perf_counter_paranoid on Linux 2.6.31).

       --<b>list-screens</b>
           List available screens and exit.

       -<b>n</b> VALUE
           Automatically exit after VALUE iterations.

       --<b>no-collect</b>
           By default, when the maximum number of open files  is  reached,  and  new  processes  appear,  tiptop
           searches  for  idle  processes and closes the files in order to make room for the new ones. This flag
           disables this behavior: in case of file shortage, new processes will not get more chances than  older
           ones.

       -<b>o</b> FILENAME
           Specify the filename for the output of batch mode.

       --<b>only-conf</b>
           Only screens defined in configuration file displayed (no default).

       -<b>p</b> <b>--pid</b> VALUE
           Filters processes according to VALUE. VALUE can be either the numeric value PID, or a string. In case
           of  a string, all tasks whose names or command lines (depending on the display, see -c) contain VALUE
           are reported.

       -<b>S</b> VALUE
           Start tiptop with screen number VALUE if VALUE is an integer. Otherwise looks for  the  first  screen
           whose name contains VALUE.

       --<b>sticky</b>
           Start in sticky mode: tasks stay in the list after they die. In live-mode, they appear in a different
           color (when supported). In batch-mode, the word DEAD is appended. (toggle)

       --<b>timestamp</b>
           Print  a  timestamp at the beginning of each row. The timestamp is the number of refreshes so far. In
           batch-mode, it is printed at the beginning of each row. In live-mode, it is  at  the  bottom  of  the
           display. (toggle)

       -<b>u</b> USER
           Only show tasks owned by USER. USER can be either a login name, or the numeric value UID.

       -<b>U</b>  Show the owner of each task. (toggle)

       -<b>v</b>  Display build information and exit.

       --<b>version</b>
           Display version information and disclaimer and exit.

       -<b>w</b> VALUE
           Watch the task specified by VALUE. VALUE can be either the numeric value PID, or a string. In case of
           a string, all tasks whose names or command lines (depending on the display, see -c) contain VALUE are
           reported. In live-mode, watched tasks are shown in a different color (when supported). In batch-mode,
           an ASCII arrow points to the watched tasks.

       -<b>W</b> PATH
           Directory where the configuration file is located.

</pre><h4><b>INTERACTIVE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       In live-mode, tiptop accepts single-key commands.

       <b>LEFT</b>, <b>RIGHT</b>
           Rotate through available screens.

       <b>&lt;</b>, <b>&gt;</b>
           Change the reference column for sorting to the left or to the right.

       <b>c</b>   Toggle between showing task names and command lines.

       <b>d</b>   Change  the  refresh  interval.  The  new  value  is  queried. Fractional values larger than 0.01 are
           accepted.

       <b>e</b>   Display the errors encoutered so far. Scroll with UP, DOWN, PAGE_UP, PAGE_DOWN, HOME and END.

       <b>h</b>   Display a brief description of the screen and each column.

       <b>H</b>   Toggle between showing individual threads and accumulating values per process.

       <b>i</b>   Toggle between showing only active tasks and showing also idle tasks.

       <b>K</b>   Toggle between showing kernel activity and only user activity. Kernel mode is only available to root.
           Switching to and from kernel mode resets all counters.

       <b>k</b>   Kill a process. The user is asked for the PID, and the signal to send.

       <b>p</b>   Filter tasks by name or PID. The user is asked for a PID or string. In case a string is entered, only
           the tasks whose name or command line contain the string are displayed. Changing the filter resets all
           counters.

       <b>q</b>   Quit.

       <b>R</b>   Change sorting order: ascending or descending.

       <b>S</b>   Toggle sticky mode.

       <b>s</b>   Same as d.

       <b>u</b>   Filter tasks by user. The user name or PID is queried. Note that, unless tiptop is  run  by  root  or
           setuid  root,  tasks  owned  by  somebody  else  cannot  be monitored. Changing the filter resets all
           counters.

       <b>U</b>   Toggle displaying each task's owner.

       <b>w</b>   Used to track a particular task. The user is asked for a PID or string. In case a string is  entered,
           all tasks whose name or command line contain the string are highlighted.

       <b>W</b>   Writes a configuration file for the current state in the current directory.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       During startup, <b>tiptop</b> attempts to read a configuration file. The file must be named <b>.tiptoprc</b>. This file
       is  first  searched  in  the current directory, then in the directory defined by the environment variable
       <b>TIPTOP</b> if it exists, finally in the user's home.

   <b>Syntax</b>
       The file is structured in XML. The syntax is as follows.

       Root of tree
              The root of the xml tree is tiptop.  &lt;tiptop&gt; ... &lt;/tiptop&gt;

       Options
              Options can be specified on an &lt;options&gt; block.

              &lt;options&gt;
                &lt;option name="option1" value="value_option1"/&gt;
                &lt;option name="option2" value="value_option2"/&gt;
                     ...  &lt;/options&gt;

              Recognized options listed below, with their corresponding command line option.

              cpu_threshold (--cpu-min), delay (-d), idle (-i), max_iter  (-n),  show_cmdline  (-c),  show_epoch
              (--epoch),  show_kernel  (-K),  show_timestamp  (--timestamp),  show_threads (-H), show_user (-U),
              watch_name (-w), sticky (--sticky), watch_uid (-w)

       Screens
              Screens are defined inside a &lt;screen&gt; block. A screen is made of counters and  columns.  A  screen
              has a name and an optional description.

              &lt;screen name="my_screen" desc="what this screen is about"&gt;
                     ....  &lt;/screen&gt;

              Counters must provide an alias (used for further reference) and a configuration. The configuration
              is  either  a  predefined  value,  or the actual value that must be provided to the perf_even_open
              system call (typically found in vendor architecture manuals).

              Predefined    values    are:    CPU_CYCLES,    INSTRUCTIONS,    CACHE_REFERENCES,    CACHE_MISSES,
              BRANCH_INSTRUCTIONS, BRANCH_MISSES, and BUS_CYCLES.

              &lt;counter alias="instr" config="INSTRUCTIONS" /&gt;

              For  non-predefined  configs,  a  type  must  be  provided.  Currently,  only RAW and HW_CACHE are
              supported.

              Optionally, a counter may be restricted to a specific architecture (such as "x86"), and  a  model.
              The   definition   of   the   model   is   architecture-dependent.  For  x86,  it  is  defined  as
              DisplayFamily_DisplayModel as computed by the instruction CPUID.  A counter for  issued  micro-ops
              on Sandy Bridge may look like the following:

              &lt;counter alias="uops_issued" config="0x010e"
                       type="RAW" arch="x86" model="06_2A" /&gt;

              For the x86 architecture, a single counter can be valid for several models.

              &lt;counter alias="uOP" config="0x1c2" type="RAW"
                       arch="x86" model="06_1A;06_1E;06_1F;06_2E" /&gt;

              When  the type is HW_CACHE, the config is specified by shifting and ORing predefined values. The 8
              least significant bits represent the cache level (possible values L1D, L1I, LL, DTLB, ITLB,  BPU).
              The  next  8  bits  represent the type of access (OP_READ, OP_WRITE, OP_PREFETCH). The last 8 bits
              represent are one of RESULT_ACCESS or RESULT_MISS.

              Note that "shift left" is expressed as shl (the usual &lt;&lt; does not fit well in xml).

              &lt;counter alias="L1Rmiss" type="HW_CACHE"
                       config="L1D | (OP_READ shl 8) | (RESULT_MISS shl 16)" /&gt;

              See also /usr/include/linux/perf_events.h for more on config and type.

              A column defines its header, the printf-like format for values,  and  an  expression.  Expressions
              evaluate as double precision. A description is optional.

              &lt;counter alias="instr" config="INSTRUCTIONS" /&gt;
              &lt;counter alias="cycle" config="CPU_CYCLES" /&gt;
              &lt;column header=" IPC" format="%4.2f"
                      desc="Total instructions per cycle"
                      expr="instr/cycle"/&gt;
              &lt;column header=" ipc" format="%4.2f"
                      desc="Total instructions per cycle"
                      expr="instr/cycle" /&gt;

              The  syntax  of  expressions  supports  basic  arithmetic (+ - * / parentheses and constants). The
              special notation "delta(counter)" evaluates as the variation of  the  counter  between  refreshes.
              Expressions  can  also  refer to predefined variables such as CPU_TOT (CPU usage), CPU_SYS (system
              CPU usage), CPU_USER (user CPU usage), PROC_ID (processor where the process was last seen).

              &lt;column header=" ipc" format="%4.2f"
                    desc="Average IPC over last period"
                    expr="delta(instr) / delta(cycle)" /&gt;

       Sample config file

              &lt;tiptop&gt;

                &lt;options&gt;
                  &lt;option name="delay" value="2.0" /&gt;
                  &lt;option name="stick" value="1" /&gt;
                &lt;/options&gt;

                &lt;screen name="example" desc="Sample config file"&gt;
                  &lt;counter alias="cycle" config="CPU_CYCLES"  /&gt;
                  &lt;counter alias="instr" config="INSTRUCTIONS" /&gt;
                  &lt;counter alias="miss" config="CACHE_MISSES" /&gt;
                  &lt;counter alias="br_miss" config="BRANCH_MISSES" /&gt;

                  &lt;!-- Sandy Bridge only --&gt;
                  &lt;counter alias="uops_issued" config="0x010e"
                           type="RAW" arch="x86" model="06_2A" /&gt;

                  &lt;column header=" %CPU" format="%5.1f"
                          desc="CPU usage" expr="CPU_TOT" /&gt;
                  &lt;column header="   P" format="  %2.0f"
                          desc="Processor where last seen" expr="PROC_ID" /&gt;

                  &lt;column header="  Minstr" format="%8.2f"
                          desc="Instructions (millions)"
                          expr="delta(instr) / 1e6" /&gt;
                  &lt;column header=" IPC" format="%4.2f"
                          desc="Executed instructions per cycle"
                          expr="delta(instr) / delta(cycle)" /&gt;
                  &lt;column header=" %MISS" format="%6.2f"
                          desc="Cache miss per instructions (in %)"
                          expr="100 * <a href="../manmiss/delta.miss.html">delta</a>(miss) / delta(instr)" /&gt;
                  &lt;column header=" %BMIS" format="%6.2f"
                          desc="Branch misprediction per instruction (in %)"
                          expr="100 * delta(br_miss) / delta(instr)" /&gt;

                &lt;/screen&gt;
              &lt;/tiptop&gt;

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       tiptop does not seem to work within a virtualized environment.

       Attaching counters to processes may fail for various reasons, such as asking for more than  available  in
       hardware  (tiptop  does  not  implement sampling), or reaching the maximum number of open files. In these
       cases, you may consider filtering the processes (see flags -u, -p).

       To mitigate the limitation of the maximum number of open files, tiptop tries to close the events attached
       to idle processes. If this is a problem, see the flag --no-collect.
