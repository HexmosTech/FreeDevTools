</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program merges the fields -- not the rows -- of delimited text files.  That is, if several files are
       almost but not quite entirely unlike each other in their structure (in their field names, numbers or
       orders), this script allows you to easily unify the files into one file with all the same fields.  The
       output can be based on fields as determined by the three "action" flags.

       For the following examples, consider three files that contain the following fields:

         +------------+---------------------------------+
         | File       | Fields                          |
         +------------+---------------------------------+
         | merge1.tab | name, type, position            |
         | merge2.tab | name, type, position, lod_score |
         | merge3.tab | name, position                  |
         +------------+---------------------------------+

       To list all available fields in the files and the number of times they are present:

         $ tabmerge --list merge*
         +-----------+-------------------+
         | Field     | No. Times Present |
         +-----------+-------------------+
         | lod_score | 1                 |
         | name      | 3                 |
         | position  | 3                 |
         | type      | 2                 |
         +-----------+-------------------+

       To merge the files on the minimum overlapping fields:

         $ tabmerge merge*
         +----------+----------+
         | name     | position |
         +----------+----------+
         | RM104    | 2.30     |
         | RM105    | 4.5      |
         | TX5509   | 10.4     |
         | UU189    | 19.0     |
         | Xpsm122  | 3.3      |
         | Xpsr9556 | 4.5      |
         | DRTL     | 2.30     |
         | ALTX     | 4.5      |
         | DWRF     | 10.4     |
         +----------+----------+

       To merge the files and include all the fields:

         $ tabmerge --max merge*
         +-----------+----------+----------+--------+
         | lod_score | name     | position | type   |
         +-----------+----------+----------+--------+
         |           | RM104    | 2.30     | RFLP   |
         |           | RM105    | 4.5      | RFLP   |
         |           | TX5509   | 10.4     | AFLP   |
         | 2.4       | UU189    | 19.0     | SSR    |
         | 1.2       | Xpsm122  | 3.3      | Marker |
         | 1.2       | Xpsr9556 | 4.5      | Marker |
         |           | DRTL     | 2.30     |        |
         |           | ALTX     | 4.5      |        |
         |           | DWRF     | 10.4     |        |
         +-----------+----------+----------+--------+

       To merge and extract just the "name" and "type" fields:

         $ tabmerge -f name,type merge*
         +----------+--------+
         | name     | type   |
         +----------+--------+
         | RM104    | RFLP   |
         | RM105    | RFLP   |
         | TX5509   | AFLP   |
         | UU189    | SSR    |
         | Xpsm122  | Marker |
         | Xpsr9556 | Marker |
         | DRTL     |        |
         | ALTX     |        |
         | DWRF     |        |
         +----------+--------+

       To merge the files on just the "name" and "lod_score" fields and sort on the name:

         $ tabmerge -f name,lod_score -s name merge*
         +----------+-----------+
         | name     | lod_score |
         +----------+-----------+
         | ALTX     |           |
         | DRTL     |           |
         | DWRF     |           |
         | RM104    |           |
         | RM105    |           |
         | TX5509   |           |
         | UU189    | 2.4       |
         | Xpsm122  | 1.2       |
         | Xpsr9556 | 1.2       |
         +----------+-----------+

       To do the same but mimic the original tab-delimited input:

         $ tabmerge -f name,lod_score -s name --stdout merge*
         name    lod_score
         ALTX
         DRTL
         DWRF
         RM104
         RM105
         TX5509
         UU189   2.4
         Xpsm122 1.2
         Xpsr9556        1.2

       Why would you want to do this?  Suppose you have several delimited text files with nearly the same
       structure and want to create just one file from them, but the fields may be in a different order in each
       file and/or some files may contain more or fewer fields than others.  (As far-fetched as it may seem, it
       happens to the author more than he'd like.)
