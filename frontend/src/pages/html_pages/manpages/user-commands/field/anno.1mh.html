</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       anno - annotate nmh messages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>anno</b> [<b>-help</b>] [<b>-version</b>] [<u>+folder</u>] [<u>msgs</u>] [<b>-component</b> <u>field</u>] [<b>-inplace</b> | <b>-noinplace</b>] [<b>-date</b> | <b>-nodate</b>]
            [<b>-draft</b>] [<b>-append</b>] [<b>-list</b>] [<b>-delete</b>] [<b>-number</b> <u>[</u>num|all<u>]]</u> [<b>-preserve</b> | <b>-nopreserve</b>] [<b>-text</b> <u>body</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>anno</b>  manipulates header fields or <u>annotations</u> in messages.  Header fields consist of a field name and an
       optional field body as defined by RFC 2822.  The <b>-component</b> switch specifies  the  field  name,  and  the
       <b>-text</b> switch specifies the field body.

       The messages are either the <u>msgs</u> in the named folder, or the draft if invoked with the <b>-draft</b> switch.

       Usually,  annotation  is  performed  by  the  commands  <b>dist</b>, <b>forw</b>, and <b>repl</b>, if they are given the <b>-anno</b>
       switch.  This allows you to keep track of your distribution of, forwarding of, and replies to a message.

       By using <b>anno</b>, you can perform arbitrary  annotations  of  your  own.   Each  message  selected  will  be
       annotated with the lines

           field: date
           field: body

       The <b>-nodate</b> switch inhibits the date annotation, leaving only the body annotation.

       By  default,  <b>anno</b>  prepends  the  annotations  to  the message.  Annotations are instead appended if the
       <b>-append</b> switch is specified.

       If a <b>-component</b> <u>field</u> is not specified when <b>anno</b> is invoked, <b>anno</b> will prompt the user for a field name.

       The field specified must be a valid RFC 2822-style message field name, consisting  only  of  alphanumeric
       characters and dashes.  The body may consist of arbitrary text.

       Normally <b>anno</b> does the annotation in place in order to preserve any links to the message.  You may change
       this by using the <b>-noinplace</b> switch.

       The  <b>-list</b>  switch  produces  a  listing  of  the  field bodies for header fields with names matching the
       specified component, one per line.  The listing is numbered, starting at 1, if the <b>-number</b> switch is also
       used.  A tab character separates the number and the field body.  The field body is treated as if it is  a
       file  name,  and  only the final path name component is listed.  The complete field body is listed if the
       <b>-text</b> switch is used; the argument to the <b>-text</b> switch is required but ignored.

       The <b>-delete</b> switch removes header fields from messages.  The first header field whose  name  matches  the
       component  is deleted if no other options are specified.  If the <b>-text</b> switch is used in conjunction with
       the <b>-delete</b> switch, the first header field whose name matches the component and whose  body  matches  the
       text  is  deleted.   The  text is treated as if it was a file name; if it begins with a slash, the entire
       field body must match the text, otherwise just the last path name component of the field body must match.
       If the <b>-number</b> switch is used in conjunction with the <b>-delete</b> switch, header field <u>num</u> whose name matches
       the component is deleted.  The number matches that which is produced by the <b>-list</b>  switch.   The  special
       value <b>all</b> can be used for the number, and causes all components that match the name to be deleted.

       By  default,  <b>anno</b> changes the last-accessed and last-modified times on annotated messages to the time of
       the annotation.  <b>anno</b> preserves the  original  times  if  the  <b>-preserve</b>  switch  is  used.   A  matching
       <b>-nopreserve</b> switch allows time preservation to be turned off, if enabled in the profile.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       $HOME/.mh_profile   The user's profile.

</pre><h4><b>PROFILE</b> <b>COMPONENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Path:               To determine the user's nmh directory.
       Current-Folder:     To find the default current folder.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULTS</b></h4><pre>
       +folder             The current folder.
       msgs                The current message.
       -inplace
       -date

</pre><h4><b>CONTEXT</b></h4><pre>
       If  a  folder  is  given, it will become the current folder.  The first message annotated will become the
       current message.
