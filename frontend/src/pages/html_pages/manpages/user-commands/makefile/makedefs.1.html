</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       makedefs - Postfix makefile configuration utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>make</b> <b>makefiles</b> <u>name=value...</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>makedefs</b> command identifies the compilation environment, and emits macro definitions on the standard
       output stream that can be prepended to template Makefiles.  These macros implement an internal  interface
       and are subject to change without notice.

</pre><h4><b>NAME=VALUE</b> <b>OVERRIDES</b></h4><pre>
       Default  settings can be overruled by specifying them as environment variables (or as name=value pairs on
       the "make" command line). Use quotes if variables contain whitespace or shell meta characters.

       The command "<b>make</b> <b>makefiles</b> <b>name=value...</b>" will replace the string <b>MAIL_VERSION</b> at the  end  of  a  value
       with the Postfix version (<u>major.minor.patchlevel</u> for a stable release, <u>major.minor-date</u> for a development
       release).   Do  not  try to specify something like <b>$mail_version</b>: that produces inconsistent results with
       different implementations of the <a href="../man1/make.1.html">make</a>(1) command.

       <b>AUXLIBS=</b><u>object_library...</u>
              Specifies one or more non-default object libraries. Postfix 3.0 and later specify  some  of  their
              database  library  dependencies  with  AUXLIBS_CDB,  AUXLIBS_LDAP,  AUXLIBS_LMDB, AUXLIBS_MONGODB,
              AUXLIBS_MYSQL, AUXLIBS_PCRE, AUXLIBS_PGSQL, AUXLIBS_SDBM, and AUXLIBS_SQLITE, respectively.

       <b>CC=</b><u>compiler_command</u>
              Specifies a non-default compiler. On many systems, the default is <b>gcc</b>.

       <b>CCARGS=</b><u>compiler_arguments</u>
              Specifies non-default compiler arguments, for  example,  a  non-default  <u>include</u>  directory.   The
              following directives are special:

              <b>-DNO_DB</b>
                     Do not build with Berkeley DB support.

              <b>-DNO_DEVPOLL</b>
                     Do  not build with Solaris /dev/poll support.  By default, /dev/poll support is compiled in
                     on platforms that are known to support it.

              <b>-DNO_DNSSEC</b>
                     Do not build with DNSSEC support, even if the resolver library appears to support it.

              <b>-DNO_EPOLL</b>
                     Do not build with Linux EPOLL support.   By  default,  EPOLL  support  is  compiled  in  on
                     platforms that are known to support it.

              <b>-DNO_EAI</b>
                     Do  not  build with EAI (SMTPUTF8) support. By default, EAI support is compiled in when the
                     "pkg-config" command is found, or the deprecated "icu-config" command.

              <b>-DNO_INLINE</b>
                     Do not require support for C99 "inline" functions. Instead, implement  argument  typechecks
                     for non-(printf/scanf)-like functions with ternary operators and unreachable code.

              <b>-DNO_IPV6</b>
                     Do  not build with IPv6 support.  By default, IPv6 support is compiled in on platforms that
                     are known to have IPv6 support.

                     Note: this directive is for debugging and testing only. It is not guaranteed to work on all
                     platforms. If you don't want IPv6 support, set "inet_protocols = ipv4" in main.cf.

              <b>-DNO_IP_CYRUS_SASL_AUTH</b>
                     Don't pass remote SMTP client and Postfix SMTP server IP address and  port  information  to
                     the Cyrus SASL library.  This is compatible with Postfix &lt; 3.2.

              <b>-DNO_KQUEUE</b>
                     Do not build with FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD/MacOSX KQUEUE support.  By default, KQUEUE support
                     is compiled in on platforms that are known to support it.

              <b>-DNO_NIS</b>
                     Do  not  build  with  NIS or NISPLUS support. Support for NIS is unavailable on some recent
                     Linux distributions.

              <b>-DNO_NISPLUS</b>
                     Do not build with NISPLUS support. Support  for  NISPLUS  is  unavailable  on  some  recent
                     Solaris distributions.

              <b>-DNO_PCRE</b>
                     Do  not  build  with  PCRE  support.   By  default,  PCRE  support  is compiled in when the
                     <b>pcre2-config</b> or <b>pcre-config</b> utility are installed.

              <b>-DNO_POSIX_GETPW_R</b>
                     Disable support for POSIX getpwnam_r/getpwuid_r.

              <b>-DNO_RES_NCALLS</b>
                     Do not build with the threadsafe <a href="../man5/resolver.5.html">resolver</a>(5) API (res_ninit() etc.).

              <b>-DNO_SIGSETJMP</b>
                     Use setjmp()/longjmp() instead  of  sigsetjmp()/siglongjmp().   By  default,  Postfix  uses
                     sigsetjmp()/siglongjmp() when they appear to work.

              <b>-DNO_SNPRINTF</b>
                     Use  sprintf() instead of snprintf(). By default, Postfix uses snprintf() except on ancient
                     systems.

       <b>DEBUG=</b><u>debug_level</u>
              Specifies a non-default debugging level. The default is <b>-g</b>.  Specify <b>DEBUG=</b> to turn off debugging.

       <b>OPT=</b><u>optimization_level</u>
              Specifies a non-default optimization  level.  The  default  is  <b>-O</b>.   Specify  <b>OPT=</b>  to  turn  off
              optimization.

       <b>POSTFIX_INSTALL_OPTS=</b><u>-option...</u>
              Specifies  options  for  the postfix-install command, separated by whitespace. Currently, the only
              supported option is <b>-keep-build-mtime</b>.

       <b>SHLIB_CFLAGS=</b><u>flags</u>
              Override the compiler flags (typically, "-fPIC")  for  Postfix  dynamically-linked  libraries  and
              database plugins.

              This feature was introduced with Postfix 3.0.

       <b>SHLIB_RPATH=</b><u>rpath</u>
              Override  the  runpath  (typically,  "'-Wl,-rpath,${SHLIB_DIR}'")  for  Postfix dynamically-linked
              libraries.

              This feature was introduced with Postfix 3.0.

       <b>SHLIB_SUFFIX=</b><u>suffix</u>
              Override the filename suffix (typically,  ".so")  for  Postfix  dynamically-linked  libraries  and
              database plugins.

              This feature was introduced with Postfix 3.0.

       <b>shared=yes</b>

       <b>shared=no</b>
              Enable    (disable)   Postfix   builds   with   dynamically-linked   libraries   typically   named
              $shlib_directory/libpostfix-*.so.*.

              This feature was introduced with Postfix 3.0.

       <b>dynamicmaps=yes</b>

       <b>dynamicmaps=no</b>
              Enable (disable) Postfix builds with the  configuration  file  $meta_directory/dynamicmaps.cf  and
              dynamically-loadable    database    plugins   typically   named   postfix-*.so.*.    The   setting
              "dynamicmaps=yes" implicitly enables Postfix dynamically-linked libraries.

              This feature was introduced with Postfix 3.0.

       <b>pie=yes</b>

       <b>pie=no</b> Enable (disable) Postfix builds with position-independent executables, on platforms where this  is
              supported.

              This feature was introduced with Postfix 3.0.

       <u>installation_parameter</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>...
              Override  the  compiled-in default value of the specified installation parameter(s). The following
              parameters are supported in this context:

              command_directory   config_directory   daemon_directory    data_directory    default_database_type
              html_directory  mail_spool_directory  mailq_path  manpage_directory meta_directory newaliases_path
              queue_directory readme_directory sendmail_path shlib_directory openssl_path

              See the <a href="../man5/postconf.5.html">postconf</a>(5) manpage for a description of these parameters.

              This feature was introduced with Postfix 3.0.

       <b>WARN=</b><u>warning_flags</u>
              Specifies non-default gcc compiler warning options for use when "make"  is  invoked  in  a  source
              subdirectory only.
