</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gopher - connect to gopher document server

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gopher</b> [<u>-sSbDr</u>] [<u>-t</u> <u>title</u>] [<u>-p</u> <u>path</u>] [<u>-T</u> <u>type</u>] [<u>-i</u> <u>search</u> <u>term</u>] [<u>hostname</u>or<u>url</u>] [<u>port</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  gopher  client  is used to talk to gopher servers.  Once you have started the gopher client, help on
       using it is available by pressing the <b>?</b>  key.

       The Internet Gopher is a distributed document delivery service.  It allows  a  neophyte  user  to  access
       various  types  of  data  residing  on  multiple  hosts  in  a seamless fashion.  This is accomplished by
       presenting the user a hierarchical arrangement of documents and by using a  client-server  communications
       model.  The Internet Gopher Server accepts simple queries, and responds by sending the client a document.

       The  [hostname]  of  a gopher server may be specified at startup; if omitted, the default server for your
       site is used.  You may also specify a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) for this argument.

       The  [Port_number] of the server host may be specified at startup; if omitted you will  use  the  default
       port  specified  at your site.  The more or less standard and accepted Gopher port number on the Internet
       is 70.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -b     starts the client on the bookmark page.

       The next few options are for more advanced users who want to start at a location other than the  default,
       or to set up special aliases or shell-scripts to point the gopher client to seperate places.

       <b>-p</b> <u>path</u>
              specify a specific selector string to send to the gopher server on startup.

       <b>-T</b> <u>type</u>
              let the client know what type of object the <u>-p</u> option is pointing at.

       <b>-i</b> <u>search</u> <u>term</u>
              tell the client what to search for in the object defined by the <u>-p</u> and <u>-T</u> <u>7</u> options.

       <b>-t</b> <u>title</u>
              set the title of the initial screen for the gopher client.

       The  last  few  options  aren't  really  of  interest  to  regular  users,  but  are  provided for system
       administrators who waht to provide a secure client, or who need to debug a client.

       <b>-s</b> or <b>-S</b>
              "secure mode" which means that you can't save or print the files that you browse.  -s is for users
              without an account, while -S assumes the user has  an  account  on  this  machine.   One  security
              feature  is  forced  on, regardless of the state of these options, if the name of the user's shell
              ends in rsh; the 'O' (options) command is disabled so  the  user  cannot  select  a  shell  as  an
              application.

       <b>-r</b>     tells the client that its user is remote.

       <b>-D</b>     turns on the copius debugging output
