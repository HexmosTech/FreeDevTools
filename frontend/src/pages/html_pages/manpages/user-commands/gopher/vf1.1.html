</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       vf1 — command line gopher client

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vf1</b> [<b>-h</b>] [<b>--bookmarks</b>] [<b>--debug</b>] [<b>--tls</b>] [<u>url</u> <u>...</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vf1</b>  is  an interactive command line gopher client.  It presents a prompt to the user, who can then enter
       commands to perform actions.

       Only a small number of commands are needed to get around, and most of them can be abbreviated to  one  or
       two chars, so with practice very quick navigation of gopherspace is possible.  See the “COMMANDS” section
       for more details.

       The options are as follows:

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
               Display a short help message and exit.

       <b>--bookmarks</b>
               Immediately navigate to bookmarks upon starting.

       <b>--debug</b>
               Start with debug mode enabled.

       <b>--tls</b>   Start in TLS mode.  See the “TLS MODE” section for more details.

       <u>url</u> <u>...</u>
               The Gopher URL(s) to open.  If more than one URL is provided, these are queued in a <b>tour</b>.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       All  <b>vf1</b>  commands  are listed below.  Most commands operate on an implicit operand from the very limited
       internal state which <b>vf1</b> maintains.

       This state includes the “lookup,” which is a list  of  items  (locations)  in  Gopherspace  with  numeric
       indices  attached.   Indices begin from 1.  Upon startup, the lookup is empty.  Whenever a gopher menu is
       visited, the contents of that menu become the contents of the lookup, replacing  any  previous  contents.
       Some  commands,  such as <b>search</b>, <b>history</b>, or <b>links</b> overwrite the lookup with their results.  At any time,
       the lookup can be reset to the contents of the most recently visited gopher menu with the <b>ls</b> command.

       In addition to the lookup, <b>vf1</b> is aware of exactly one active  item  (the  item  the  user  is  currently
       viewing).  Usually, the active item is one of the items in the lookup, and if so <b>vf1</b> knows its index.

       Most <b>vf1</b> commands operate on either the lookup, or the active item.

       In addition to the commands listed below, users can enter a numeric index.  <b>vf1</b> will then navigate to the
       corresponding item in the lookup, and that item will become the active item.

       <b>a</b>, <b>add</b>  Add the URL of the current item to the bookmarks menu.

       <b>b</b>, <b>back</b>
               Go back to the previous item in the history.

       <b>bb</b>, <b>blackbox</b>
               Display contents of flight recorder, showing statistics for the current gopher browsing session.

       <b>bm</b>, <b>book</b>, <b>bookmarks</b>
               Show the current bookmarks menu.

       <b>cat</b>     Process the text of the current item with the <u><a href="../man1/cat.1.html">cat</a></u>(1) command.

       <b>exit</b>    Exit VF-1.  Go forward to the next item in the history.

       <b>f</b>, <b>fold</b>
               Process the text of the current item with the <u><a href="../man1/fold.1.html">fold</a></u>(1) command, wrapping lines at 70 characters.

       <b>fo</b>, <b>forward</b>
               Go forward to the next item in the history.

       <b>g</b>, <b>go</b> <u>url</u> | <u>mark</u>
               Visit a gopher URL or marked item, making it the active item.

       <b>handler</b> [<u>mimetype</u> <u>program</u>]
               List or set handlers for different MIME types.  See “HANDLERS” section below for more details.

       <b>help</b> [<u>command</u>]
               Display help information for a command, or list all commands with help information available.

       <b>h</b>, <b>hist</b>, <b>history</b>
               Display the history.

       <b>l</b>, <b>less</b>
               Process the text of the current item with the <u><a href="../man1/less.1.html">less</a></u>(1) command.

       <b>li</b>, <b>links</b>
               Extract URLs from the text of the current item, and populate the lookup with them.

       <b>ls</b> [-l]
               Set  the  lookup  to  the  contents  of  the  most recently visited gopher menu and then list the
               lookup's contents.  If invoked as <b>ls</b> <b>-l</b> the listing will include the URL of each menu item.

       <b>m</b>, <b>mark</b> [<u>mark</u>]
               Mark the current item with a single letter.  This letter can then be passed to the <b>go</b> command  to
               return to the current item later.  Lists all defined marks when no argument is given.

       <b>n</b>, <b>next</b>
               Go to the item which is after the current item in the lookup.

       <b>p</b>, <b>prev,</b> <b>previous</b>

               from its gopher selector.  <b>save</b> <b>filename</b> saves the current  item  with  the  specified  filename.
               <b>save</b>  <b>n</b>  saves  the item at lookup index n with an automagic filename.  <b>save</b> <b>n</b> <b>filename</b> saves the
               item at lookup index n with the specified filename.

       <b>/</b>, <b>se</b>, <b>search</b> <u>pattern</u>

               arguments are provided, the next item in the tour is visited.  Items from the lookup can be added
               with a list of indices like <b>tour</b> <b>1</b> <b>2</b> <b>3</b> <b>4</b>, or consecutive ranges like <b>tour</b> <b>1-4</b>.  All items in  the
               lookup  can  be  added  with <b>tour</b> <b>*</b>.  Items not in the lookup can be added by their URL with <b>tour</b>
               <u>url</u>.  The current tour queue can be listed with <b>tour</b> <b>ls</b> and scrubbed with <b>tour</b> <b>clear</b>.

       <b>up</b>, <b>u</b>   Go up one directory in the path.

       <b>url</b>     Show the URL of the current item.

       <b>v</b>, <b>veronica</b> [<u>query</u>]
               Submit a search query to the Veronica 2 search engine.

</pre><h4><b>HANDLERS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vf1</b> uses external programs as “handlers” to present different gopherspace content to the user.  Even when
       visiting a plain text file with item type 0, <b>vf1</b> uses (by default) the unix  command  <u><a href="../man1/cat.1.html">cat</a></u>(1)  to  display
       that  file  on  the  screen, rather than using a Python <b>print</b>() call.  Users have full control over which
       external programs are used for different content, so the user experience can be customised to taste.

       Handlers are assigned on the basis of MIME types.  The gopher protocol has no concept of  MIME  type,  so
       <b>vf1</b>  assigns  each  item a MIME type itself in the manner described in the section “MIME type assignment”
       below.

       A list of the current handler assignments can be viewed at any time by running the <b>handler</b> command.   The
       default handlers that ship with <b>vf1</b> are:

             <b>MIME</b> <b>type</b>          <b>handler</b>
             application/pdf:   xpdf %s
             audio/mpeg:        mpg123 %s
             audio/ogg:         ogg123 %s
             image/*:           feh %s
             text/*:            Ta cat %s
             text/html:         lynx -dump -force_html %s

       The  <b>handler</b>  command  can  be  used  to  change these handlers, or set handlers for new MIME types.  For
       example, users who prefer <u><a href="../man1/w3m.1.html">w3m</a></u>(1) over <u><a href="../man1/lynx.1.html">lynx</a></u>(1) for handling HTML content could run:

             <b>VF-1&gt;</b> <b>handler</b> <b>text/html</b> <b>w3m</b> <b>-dump</b> <b>%s</b>

       The specified handler will be run as a shell command, with the temporary file containing the  content  of
       the  current gopher item replacing any occurrences of %s.  Pipe syntax can be used to pass gopher content
       through multiple text filters to achieve the desired appearance.

       The ‘*’ wildcard can be used when specifying handler MIME types, e.g.  ‘image/*’ allows  using  a  single
       program  to  handle  any  kind  of  image.  Handlers without wildcards take precedence over handlers with
       wildcards.  In other words, if one handler is specified for ‘image/jpeg’  and  a  different  handler  for
       ‘image/*’, the ‘image/jpeg’ handler will be used for JPEGs and the ‘image/*’ handler will be used for all
       other images.

   <b>MIME</b> <b>type</b> <b>assignment</b>
       <b>vf1</b> assigns MIME types to gopher items as follows:

       <b>•</b>   Item types 0 and 1 are assigned MIME type ‘text/plain’

       <b>•</b>   Item type h is assigned MIME type ‘text/html’

       <b>•</b>   Item type g is assigned MIME type ‘image/gif’

       For all other item types, <b>vf1</b> attempts to guess a MIME type from the file extension of the last component
       of  the selector, using the ‘mimetypes’ module from the Python standard library.  This usually results in
       a reliable identification assuming the file has an extension and the author of the gopher content is  not
       being deliberately deceptive.

       If  the selector has no file extension, or the extension is not recognised by the ‘itemtypes’ module, <b>vf1</b>
       will use the unix program <u><a href="../man1/file.1.html">file</a></u>(1) to attempt to guess a MIME type by actually inspecting the  content  of
       the file.

       In  accordance  with  the  idea that gopher item types, which are a standard part of the protocol, should
       take precedence over any other attempt at inferring MIME type, which  is  not  a  standard  part  of  the
       protocol,  if  an  item  in  gopherspace  is listed with itemtype ‘I’ or ‘s’ and one of the above methods
       returns a MIME type which does not begin with ‘image/’ or ‘sound/’  respectively,  <b>vf1</b>  will  default  to
       ‘image/jpeg’  or  ‘audio/mpeg’ respectively.  This should only happen in highly unusual circumstances and
       suggests a poorly or maliciously configured gopher server.

</pre><h4><b>TEXT</b> <b>ENCODING</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vf1</b> attempts to decode the content received for any text-based item types (e.g. 0, 1,  7,  h)  as  UTF-8.
       Most  content  in  gopherspace  is ASCII-encoded, and since UTF-8 is backward compatible with ASCII, this
       will generally “just work”.  If the received content <u>cannot</u> be decoded as  UTF-8,  one  of  two  possible
       things will happen:

       If  the  ‘chardet’  Python  module  is  installed, <b>vf1</b> will use it to attempt to automatically detect the
       encoding used and decode the  text  appropriately.   Note  that  pip  etc.  will  not  install  ‘chardet’
       automatically  when  installing  <b>vf1</b>,  as  <b>vf1</b>  does  not  formally  depend  on  ‘chardet’.   It  uses it
       opportunistically, so that it can still be easily installed and used on systems where ‘chardet’ is not or
       cannot be installed.

       If ‘chardet’ is not installed, or if ‘chardet’ cannot identify an encoding with confidence exceeding 0.5,
       <b>vf1</b> will attempt to fall back to a single, user-specified alternative encoding.  This encoding can be set
       as follows:

             <b>VF-1&gt;</b> <b>set</b> <b>encoding</b> <b>koi8-r</b>

       The default fall back encoding is iso-8559-1, which is used by  the  popular  gopher  site  floodgap.com.
       Users  who  routinely  visit  gopher sites encoded with some other encoding may consider using an RC file
       (see below) to automatically set the alternative encoding at start up.

</pre><h4><b>TLS</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vf1</b> supports TLS connections.  This is an experimental feature, and TLS connections are not supported  by
       the majority of gopher servers.  As such, TLS support must be explicitly activatd by using the command to
       enable  TLS  mode (aka "Battloid mode").  When TLS mode is enabled, <u>all</u> gopher requests will be made over
       TLS, so most requests will fail when a connection to the server cannot be established.  TLS mode must  be
       explicitly deactivated to resume browsing unencrypted gopherspace.

</pre><h4><b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       The following miscellaneous settings can be adjusted with the command.

       <b>color_menus</b>
               If  set  to  true,  items  in gopher menus will be color coded according to item type, using ANSI
               escape codes.  Default value is false.

       <b>debug</b>   If set to true, detailed debugging information will be printed to stdout when commands  are  run.
               Default value is false.

       <b>encoding</b>
               Fallback  text  encoding  to  use if received gopher content cannot be decoded as UTF-8.  See the
               “TEXT ENCODING” section for more details.  Default value is iso-8859-1.

       <b>ipv6</b>    If set to true, <b>vf1</b> will preferentially attempt to connect to gopher servers via IPv6 if  a  AAAA
               DNS  record  is  found.   If  the  IPv6 connection fails, <b>vf1</b> will automatically retry with IPv4.
               Default value is true.

       <b>timeout</b>
               Time to wait, in seconds, when trying to connect to a gopher server before  giving  up.   Default
               value is 10.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:~/.vf1-bookmarks.txt">~/.vf1-bookmarks.txt</a></u>  This  file  stores gopher bookmarks, in a simple gophermap format (without hosts or
                             ports).  Use <b>add</b> to add the current URL to the bookmark list.
       <u><a href="file:~/.config/vf1/vf1rc">~/.config/vf1/vf1rc</a></u>
       <u><a href="file:~/.config/.vf1rc">~/.config/.vf1rc</a></u>
       <u><a href="file:~/.vf1rc">~/.vf1rc</a></u>              Upon startup, <b>vf1</b> will search for a file with one of these names,  a  so-called  RC
                             file  (see  below).The  names  are listed above in order of preference and <b>vf1</b> will
                             stop after the first one it finds, e.g. if both <u><a href="file:~/.config/vf1/vf1rc">~/.config/vf1/vf1rc</a></u> and a  <u><a href="file:~/.vf1rc">~/.vf1rc</a></u>
                             exist then then <u><a href="file:~/.vf1rc">~/.vf1rc</a></u> will be ignored.

   <b>RC</b> <b>FILE</b>
       If  an  RC  file  is  found, each line of the file will be executed as a <b>vf1</b> command before the prompt is
       displayed.This allows users to script certain commands that should be run  every  time  <b>vf1</b>  is  started.
       This permits, for example:

       <b>•</b>   Permanently configuring item type handlers by putting <b>handler</b> commands in the RC file.

       <b>•</b>   Permanently  configuring  the preferred non-UTF-8 encoding, or other options, by putting <b>set</b> commands
           in the RC file.

       <b>•</b>   Setting a “home page” by putting a <b>go</b> command in the RC file.

       <b>•</b>   Starting a tour through a list of favourite sites by putting <b>tour</b> commands in the RC file.
