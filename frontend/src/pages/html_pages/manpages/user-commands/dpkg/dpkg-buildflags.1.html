</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dpkg-buildflags - returns build flags to use during package build

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dpkg-buildflags</b> [<u>option</u>...] [<u>command</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dpkg-buildflags</b> is a tool to retrieve compilation flags to use during build of Debian packages.

       The default flags are defined by the vendor but they can be extended/overridden in several ways:

       1.  system-wide with <b>/etc/dpkg/buildflags.conf</b>;

       2.  for  the  current  user with <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dpkg/buildflags.conf</b> where <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</b> defaults to
           <b>$HOME/.config</b>;

       3.  temporarily by the user with environment variables (see section "ENVIRONMENT");

       4.  dynamically by the package maintainer with environment variables set via  <b>debian/rules</b>  (see  section
           "ENVIRONMENT").

       The configuration files can contain four types of directives:

       <b>SET</b> <u>flag</u> <u>value</u>
           Override the flag named <u>flag</u> to have the value <u>value</u>.

       <b>STRIP</b> <u>flag</u> <u>value</u>
           Strip from the flag named <u>flag</u> all the build flags listed in <u>value</u>.  Since dpkg 1.16.1.

       <b>APPEND</b> <u>flag</u> <u>value</u>
           Extend  the  flag  named  <u>flag</u>  by appending the options given in <u>value</u>.  A space is prepended to the
           appended value if the flag's current value is non-empty.

       <b>PREPEND</b> <u>flag</u> <u>value</u>
           Extend the flag named <u>flag</u> by prepending the options given in <u>value</u>.  A  space  is  appended  to  the
           prepended value if the flag's current value is non-empty.  Since dpkg 1.16.1.

       The  configuration  files  can  contain comments on lines starting with a hash (#).  Empty lines are also
       ignored.

       This program was introduced in dpkg 1.15.7.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--dump</b>
           Print to standard output all compilation flags and  their  values.   It  prints  one  flag  per  line
           separated from its value by an equal sign (“<u>flag</u>=<u>value</u>”).  This is the default action.

       <b>--list</b>
           Print  the  list  of flags supported by the current vendor (one per line).  See the "SUPPORTED FLAGS"
           section for more information about them.

       <b>--status</b>
           Display any information that can be useful to explain the behavior  of  <b>dpkg-buildflags</b>  (since  dpkg
           1.16.5):  relevant environment variables, current vendor, state of all feature flags.  Also print the
           resulting compiler flags with their origin.

           This is intended to be run from <b>debian/rules</b>, so that the build log keeps a clear trace of the  build
           flags used.  This can be useful to diagnose problems related to them.

       <b>--export=</b><u>format</u>
           Print  to  standard  output  commands  that  can be used to export all the compilation flags for some
           particular tool.  If the <u>format</u> value is not given, <b>sh</b> is assumed.  Only compilation  flags  starting
           with an upper case character are included, others are assumed to not be suitable for the environment.
           Supported formats:

           <b>sh</b>  Shell  commands  to set and export all the compilation flags in the environment.  The flag values
               are quoted so the output is ready for evaluation by a shell.

           <b>cmdline</b>
               Arguments to pass to a build program's command line to use all the compilation flags (since  dpkg
               1.17.0).  The flag values are quoted in shell syntax.

           <b>configure</b>
               This is a legacy alias for <b>cmdline</b>.

           <b>make</b>
               Make  directives  to  set and export all the compilation flags in the environment.  Output can be
               written to a Makefile fragment and evaluated using an <b>include</b> directive.

       <b>--get</b> <u>flag</u>
           Print the value of the flag on standard output.  Exits with 0 if the flag is  known  otherwise  exits
           with 1.

       <b>--origin</b> <u>flag</u>
           Print the origin of the value that is returned by <b>--get</b>.  Exits with 0 if the flag is known otherwise
           exits with 1.  The origin can be one of the following values:

           <b>vendor</b>
               the original flag set by the vendor is returned;

           <b>system</b>
               the flag is set/modified by a system-wide configuration;

           <b>user</b>
               the flag is set/modified by a user-specific configuration;

           <b>env</b> the flag is set/modified by an environment-specific configuration.

       <b>--query</b>
           Print  any  information  that  can  be useful to explain the behavior of the program: current vendor,
           relevant environment variables, feature areas, state of all  feature  flags,  whether  a  feature  is
           handled  as a builtin default by the compiler (since dpkg 1.21.14), and the compiler flags with their
           origin (since dpkg 1.19.0).

           For example:

            Vendor: Debian
            Environment:
             DEB_CFLAGS_SET=-O0 -Wall

            Area: qa
            Features:
             bug=no
             canary=no
            Builtins:

            Area: hardening
            Features:
             pie=no
            Builtins:
             pie=yes

            Area: reproducible
            Features:
             timeless=no
            Builtins:

            Flag: CFLAGS
            Value: -O0 -Wall
            Origin: env

            Flag: CPPFLAGS
            Value: -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3
            Origin: vendor

       <b>--query-features</b> <u>area</u>
           Print the features enabled for a given area (since dpkg 1.16.2).  If the feature is handled (even  if
           only  on  some  architectures)  as a builtin default by the compiler, then a <b>Builtin</b> field is printed
           (since dpkg 1.21.14).  See  the  "FEATURE  AREAS"  section  for  more  details  about  the  currently
           recognized areas.  Exits with 0 if the area is known otherwise exits with 1.

           The output is in RFC822 format, with one section per feature.  For example:

            Feature: pie
            Enabled: yes
            Builtin: yes

            Feature: stackprotector
            Enabled: yes

       <b>--help</b>
           Show the usage message and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Show the version and exit.

</pre><h4><b>FEATURE</b> <b>AREAS</b></h4><pre>
       Feature areas are currently vendor specific, and the ones described below are only recognized  on  Debian
       and derivatives.

       Each  area  feature  can  be  enabled  and  disabled in the <b>DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS</b> and <b>DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS</b>
       environment variable's area value with the ‘<b>+</b>’ and ‘<b>-</b>’ modifier.  Following the general syntax  of  these
       variables  (described  in  <b><a href="../man1/dpkg-buildpackage.1.html">dpkg-buildpackage</a></b>(1)),  multiple  feature  areas can be specified separated by
       spaces, where each get feature specifiers as mandatory parameters after an equal sign (‘<b>=</b>’).  The feature
       specifiers are comma-separated and parsed from left to right, where the settings within the same  feature
       specifier  override  previous  ones,  even  if  the  feature  specifiers are split across multiple space-
       separated feature area settings for the same area.

       For example, to enable the <b>hardening</b> “pie” feature and disable the “fortify” feature you can do  this  in
       <b>debian/rules</b>:

           export DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS = hardening=+pie,-fortify

       The  special  feature  <b>all</b>  (valid in any area) can be used to enable or disable all area features at the
       same time.  Thus disabling everything in the <b>hardening</b> area and enabling only “format” and “fortify”  can
       be achieved with:

           export DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS = hardening=-all,+format,+fortify

       Multiple feature areas can be set:

           export DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS = hardening=+pie abi=+lfs

       The  override  behavior applies as much to the <b>all</b> special feature, as to specific features, which should
       allow for composition.  Thus to enable “lfs” in the <b>abi</b>  area,  and  only  “pie”  and  “fortify”  in  the
       <b>hardening</b> area, but “format” only when CONDITION is defined, this could be done with:

           export DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS = hardening=-all,+pie,+format abi=+lfs
           …
           DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS += hardening=+fortify
           ifdef CONDITION
           DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS += hardening=-format
           endif

   <b>abi</b>
       Several compile-time options (detailed below) can be used to enable features that can change the ABI of a
       package,  but  cannot  be enabled by default due to backwards compatibility reasons unless coordinated or
       checked individually.

       <b>lfs</b> This setting (since  dpkg  1.22.0;  disabled  by  default)  enables  Large  File  Support  on  32-bit
           architectures  where  their  ABI  does  not  include  LFS  by  default, by adding <b>-D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE</b>
           <b>-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64</b> to <b>CPPFLAGS</b>.

           When this feature is enabled it will override the value from the same feature in the  <b>future</b>  feature
           area.

       <b>time64</b>
           This  setting  (since  dpkg  1.22.0;  enabled by default except for i386, hurd-i386 and kfreebsd-i386
           since dpkg 1.22.5) enables 64-bit time_t support on 32-bit architectures where  their  ABI  does  not
           include it by default, by adding <b>-D_TIME_BITS=64</b> to <b>CPPFLAGS</b>.  This setting automatically enables the
           <b>lfs</b> feature from the <b>abi</b> feature area.

           If the setting is enabled explicitly then it gets enabled on all architectures including i386 but not
           hurd-i386  nor  kfreebsd-i386 (where the kernel does not have time64 interfaces), ignoring the binary
           backwards compatibility default.

           It is also enabled by default by gcc on the armel, armhf, hppa, m68k, mips, mipsel, powerpc  and  sh4
           Debian   architectures,   where   disabling   the   feature   will  add  instead  <b>-U_LARGEFILE_SOURCE</b>
           <b>-U_FILE_OFFSET_BITS</b> <b>-U_TIME_BITS</b> to <b>CPPFLAGS</b>.

   <b>future</b>
       Several compile-time options (detailed below) can be used to enable features that should  be  enabled  by
       default, but cannot due to backwards compatibility reasons.

       <b>lfs</b> This  setting (since dpkg 1.19.0; disabled by default) is now an alias for the <b>lfs</b> feature in the <b>abi</b>
           area, use that instead.  The feature from the <b>abi</b> area overrides this setting.

   <b>qa</b>
       Several compile-time options (detailed below) can be used to help detect problems in the source  code  or
       build system.

       <b>bug-implicit-func</b>
           This    setting    (since    dpkg    1.22.3;   enabled   by   default   since   dpkg   1.22.6)   adds
           <b>-Werror=implicit-function-declaration</b> to <b>CFLAGS</b>.

       <b>bug</b> This setting (since dpkg 1.17.4; disabled by default) adds any warning option that  reliably  detects
           problematic  source code.  The warnings are fatal.  The only currently supported flags are <b>CFLAGS</b> and
           <b>CXXFLAGS</b>      with      flags       set       to       <b>-Werror=array-bounds</b>,       <b>-Werror=clobbered</b>,
           <b>-Werror=implicit-function-declaration</b> and <b>-Werror=volatile-register-var</b>.

           This feature handles <b>-Werror=implicit-function-declaration</b> via the <b>bug-implicit-func</b> feature, if that
           has not been specified.

       <b>canary</b>
           This  setting (since dpkg 1.17.14; disabled by default) adds dummy canary options to the build flags,
           so that the build logs can be checked for how the build flags propagate  and  to  allow  finding  any
           omission  of  normal  build  flag settings.  The only currently supported flags are <b>CPPFLAGS</b>, <b>CFLAGS</b>,
           <b>OBJCFLAGS</b>, <b>CXXFLAGS</b> and <b>OBJCXXFLAGS</b> with flags set to  <b>-D__DEB_CANARY_</b><u>flag</u>_<u>random-id</u><b>__</b>,  and  <b>LDFLAGS</b>
           set to <b>-Wl,-z,deb-canary-</b><u>random-id</u>.

       <b>elfpackagemetadata</b>
           This  setting  (since  dpkg  1.22.6ubuntu11;  enabled by default) adds an ELF note containing package
           metadata to every ELF binary being built. If the $DEB_BUILD_DEBUG_INFO_URL  environment  variable  is
           defined,  it  will  be  used to include the value as a debuginfod URL. This follows the specification
           defined at: https://systemd.io/ELF_PACKAGE_METADATA/

   <b>optimize</b>
       Several compile-time options (detailed below) can be used to help optimize a resulting binary (since dpkg
       1.21.0).  <b>Note</b>: Enabling <b>all</b> these options can result in unreproducible binary artifacts.

       <b>lto</b> This  setting  (since  dpkg  1.21.0)  enables   Link   Time   Optimization   by   adding   <b>-flto=auto</b>
           <b>-ffat-lto-objects</b> to <b>CFLAGS</b>, <b>CXXFLAGS</b>, <b>OBJCFLAGS</b>, <b>OBJCXXFLAGS</b>, <b>FFLAGS</b>, <b>FCFLAGS</b> and <b>LDFLAGS</b>.

           Note:  this  option is enabled by default in Ubuntu on all 64bit architectures, except for riscv64. A
           list    of     packages     with     LTO     disabled     by     default     is     maintained     in
           <b>/usr/share/lto-disabled-list/lto-disabled-list</b>, provided by the lto-disabled-list package.

   <b>sanitize</b>
       Several  compile-time  options  (detailed  below) can be used to help sanitize a resulting binary against
       memory corruptions, memory leaks, use after free, threading  data  races  and  undefined  behavior  bugs.
       <b>Note</b>:  These  options  should  <b>not</b>  be  used  for  production  builds  as they can reduce reliability for
       conformant code, reduce security or even functionality.

       <b>address</b>
           This setting (since dpkg  1.18.0;  disabled  by  default)  adds  <b>-fsanitize=address</b>  to  <b>LDFLAGS</b>  and
           <b>-fsanitize=address</b> <b>-fno-omit-frame-pointer</b> to <b>CFLAGS</b> and <b>CXXFLAGS</b>.

       <b>thread</b>
           This  setting (since dpkg 1.18.0; disabled by default) adds <b>-fsanitize=thread</b> to <b>CFLAGS</b>, <b>CXXFLAGS</b> and
           <b>LDFLAGS</b>.

       <b>leak</b>
           This setting (since dpkg 1.18.0; disabled by default)  adds  <b>-fsanitize=leak</b>  to  <b>LDFLAGS</b>.   It  gets
           automatically disabled if either the <b>address</b> or the <b>thread</b> features are enabled, as they imply it.

       <b>undefined</b>
           This  setting  (since dpkg 1.18.0; disabled by default) adds <b>-fsanitize=undefined</b> to <b>CFLAGS</b>, <b>CXXFLAGS</b>
           and <b>LDFLAGS</b>.

   <b>hardening</b>
       Several compile-time options (detailed below) can be used to  help  harden  a  resulting  binary  against
       memory  corruption  attacks,  or provide additional warning messages during compilation.  Except as noted
       below, these are enabled by default for architectures that support them.

       <b>format</b>
           This setting (since dpkg 1.16.1; enabled by default) adds <b>-Wformat</b> <b>-Werror=format-security</b> to <b>CFLAGS</b>,
           <b>CXXFLAGS</b>, <b>OBJCFLAGS</b> and <b>OBJCXXFLAGS</b>.  This will warn about improper format string uses, and will fail
           when format functions are used in a way that represent possible security problems.  At present,  this
           warns  about  calls to <b>printf</b> and <b>scanf</b> functions where the format string is not a string literal and
           there are no format arguments, as in <b>printf(foo);</b>  instead  of  <b>printf("%s",</b>  <b>foo);</b>  This  may  be  a
           security hole if the format string came from untrusted input and contains ‘%n’.

       <b>fortify</b>
           This  setting  (since  dpkg 1.16.1; enabled by default) adds <b>-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3</b> to <b>CPPFLAGS</b>.  During
           code generation the compiler knows a great deal of information about buffer sizes  (where  possible),
           and  attempts  to  replace  insecure unlimited length buffer function calls with length-limited ones.
           This is especially useful for old, crufty code.  Additionally, format strings in writable memory that
           contain ‘%n’ are blocked.  If an application depends on such a format string,  it  will  need  to  be
           worked around.

           Note  that  for  this option to have any effect, the source must also be compiled with <b>-O1</b> or higher.
           If the environment variable <b>DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS</b> contains <u>noopt</u>, then <b>fortify</b> support will be  disabled,
           due to new warnings being issued by glibc 2.16 and later.

       <b>stackprotector</b>
           This  setting  (since  dpkg  1.16.1;  enabled  by default if stackprotectorstrong is not in use) adds
           <b>-fstack-protector</b> <b>--param=ssp-buffer-size=4</b> to <b>CFLAGS</b>, <b>CXXFLAGS</b>, <b>OBJCFLAGS</b>, <b>OBJCXXFLAGS</b>,  <b>FFLAGS</b>  and
           <b>FCFLAGS</b>.   This  adds  safety  checks  against  stack  overwrites.   This renders many potential code
           injection  attacks  into  aborting  situations.   In  the  best  case  this  turns   code   injection
           vulnerabilities into denial of service or into non-issues (depending on the application).

           This feature requires linking against glibc (or another provider of <b>__stack_chk_fail</b>), so needs to be
           disabled when building with <b>-nostdlib</b> or <b>-ffreestanding</b> or similar.

       <b>stackprotectorstrong</b>
           This  setting  (since  dpkg  1.17.11;  enabled  by  default) adds <b>-fstack-protector-strong</b> to <b>CFLAGS</b>,
           <b>CXXFLAGS</b>, <b>OBJCFLAGS</b>, <b>OBJCXXFLAGS</b>, <b>FFLAGS</b> and <b>FCFLAGS</b>.  This is a stronger variant of  <b>stackprotector</b>,
           but without significant performance penalties.

           Disabling <b>stackprotector</b> will also disable this setting.

           This  feature  has the same requirements as <b>stackprotector</b>, and in addition also requires gcc 4.9 and
           later.

       <b>stackclash</b>
           This setting (since dpkg 1.22.0; enabled by default) adds <b>-fstack-clash-protection</b> on  <b>amd64</b>,  <b>arm64</b>,
           <b>armhf</b>  and  <b>armel</b> to <b>CFLAGS</b>, <b>CXXFLAGS</b>, <b>OBJCFLAGS</b>, <b>OBJCXXFLAGS</b>, <b>FFLAGS</b> and <b>FCFLAGS</b>.  This adds code to
           prevent stack clash style attacks.

       <b>branch</b>
           This  setting  (since  dpkg  1.22.0;  enabled  by  default)  adds  <b>-fcf-protection</b>   on   <b>amd64</b>   and
           <b>-mbranch-protection=standard</b>  on  <b>arm64</b>  to  <b>CFLAGS</b>,  <b>CXXFLAGS</b>,  <b>OBJCFLAGS</b>,  <b>OBJCXXFLAGS</b>,  <b>FFLAGS</b> and
           <b>FCFLAGS</b>.  This adds branch protection to indirect calls, jumps and returns to check whether these are
           valid at run-time.

       <b>relro</b>
           This setting (since dpkg 1.16.1; enabled by default) adds <b>-Wl,-z,relro</b> to  <b>LDFLAGS</b>.   During  program
           load, several ELF memory sections need to be written to by the linker.  This flags the loader to turn
           these  sections read-only before turning over control to the program.  Most notably this prevents GOT
           overwrite attacks.  If this option is disabled, <b>bindnow</b> will become disabled as well.

       <b>bindnow</b>
           This setting (since dpkg 1.16.1; disabled by default) adds <b>-Wl,-z,now</b>  to  <b>LDFLAGS</b>.   During  program
           load,  all  dynamic  symbols are resolved, allowing for the entire PLT to be marked read-only (due to
           <b>relro</b> above).  The option cannot become enabled if <b>relro</b> is not enabled.

       <b>pie</b> This setting (since dpkg 1.16.1; with no global default since dpkg  1.18.23,  as  it  is  enabled  by
           default now by gcc on the amd64, arm64, armel, armhf, hurd-i386, i386, kfreebsd-amd64, kfreebsd-i386,
           mips,   mipsel,  mips64el,  powerpc,  ppc64,  ppc64el,  riscv64,  s390x,  sparc  and  sparc64  Debian
           architectures) adds the required options to enable or disable PIE via gcc  specs  files,  if  needed,
           depending  on  whether gcc injects on that architecture the flags by itself or not.  When the setting
           is enabled and gcc injects the flags, it adds nothing.  When the setting is enabled and gcc does  not
           inject  the  flags,  it  adds  <b>-fPIE</b>  (via  <u>/usr/share/dpkg/pie-compiler.specs</u>)  to <b>CFLAGS</b>, <b>CXXFLAGS</b>,
           <b>OBJCFLAGS</b>, <b>OBJCXXFLAGS</b>, <b>FFLAGS</b> and <b>FCFLAGS</b>, and <b>-fPIE</b> <b>-pie</b>  (via  <u>/usr/share/dpkg/pie-link.specs</u>)  to
           <b>LDFLAGS</b>.   When  the  setting  is  disabled  and  gcc  injects  the  flags,  it  adds  <b>-fno-PIE</b>  (via
           <u>/usr/share/dpkg/no-pie-compile.specs</u>)  to  <b>CFLAGS</b>,  <b>CXXFLAGS</b>,  <b>OBJCFLAGS</b>,  <b>OBJCXXFLAGS</b>,  <b>FFLAGS</b>   and
           <b>FCFLAGS</b>, and <b>-fno-PIE</b> <b>-no-pie</b> (via <u>/usr/share/dpkg/no-pie-link.specs</u>) to <b>LDFLAGS</b>.

           Position  Independent  Executable  (PIE)  is  needed  to  take  advantage  of  Address  Space  Layout
           Randomization (ASLR), supported by some kernel versions.  While ASLR can already be enforced for data
           areas in the stack and heap (brk and mmap), the code areas must be compiled as  position-independent.
           Shared  libraries  already do this (<b>-fPIC</b>), so they gain ASLR automatically, but binary .text regions
           need to be built as PIE to gain ASLR.  When this happens, ROP (Return Oriented  Programming)  attacks
           are  much  harder  since  there  are  no static locations to bounce off of during a memory corruption
           attack.

           PIE is not compatible with <b>-fPIC</b>, so in general care must be taken when building shared objects.  But
           because the PIE flags emitted get injected  via  gcc  specs  files,  it  should  always  be  safe  to
           unconditionally set them regardless of the object type being compiled or linked.

           Static  libraries  can be used by programs or other shared libraries.  Depending on the flags used to
           compile all the objects within a static library, these libraries will be usable by different sets  of
           objects:

           none
               Cannot be linked into a PIE program, nor a shared library.

           <b>-fPIE</b>
               Can be linked into any program, but not a shared library (recommended).

           <b>-fPIC</b>
               Can be linked into any program and shared library.

           If  there is a need to set these flags manually, bypassing the gcc specs injection, there are several
           things to take into account.  Unconditionally and explicitly passing <b>-fPIE</b>, <b>-fpie</b> or <b>-pie</b> to a build-
           system using libtool is safe as these  flags  will  get  stripped  when  building  shared  libraries.
           Otherwise  on projects that build both programs and shared libraries you might need to make sure that
           when building the shared libraries <b>-fPIC</b> is always passed last (so that  it  overrides  any  previous
           <b>-PIE</b>)  to  compilation  flags  such  as  <b>CFLAGS</b>, and <b>-shared</b> is passed last (so that it overrides any
           previous <b>-pie</b>) to linking flags such as <b>LDFLAGS</b>.  <b>Note</b>: This should not be needed  with  the  default
           gcc specs machinery.

           Additionally,  since  PIE  is implemented via a general register, some register starved architectures
           (but not including i386 anymore since optimizations implemented in gcc  &gt;=  5)  can  see  performance
           losses  of  up  to 15% in very text-segment-heavy application workloads; most workloads see less than
           1%.  Architectures with more general registers (e.g. amd64) do not see as high a worst-case penalty.

   <b>reproducible</b>
       The compile-time options detailed below can be used to help  improve  build  reproducibility  or  provide
       additional  warning messages during compilation.  Except as noted below, these are enabled by default for
       architectures that support them.

       <b>timeless</b>
           This setting (since dpkg 1.17.14; enabled by default) adds <b>-Wdate-time</b> to <b>CPPFLAGS</b>.  This will  cause
           warnings when the <b>__TIME__</b>, <b>__DATE__</b> and <b>__TIMESTAMP__</b> macros are used.

       <b>fixfilepath</b>
           This  setting  (since dpkg 1.19.1; enabled by default) adds <b>-ffile-prefix-map=</b><u>BUILDPATH</u><b>=.</b>  to <b>CFLAGS</b>,
           <b>CXXFLAGS</b>, <b>OBJCFLAGS</b>, <b>OBJCXXFLAGS</b>, <b>FFLAGS</b>  and  <b>FCFLAGS</b>  where  <b>BUILDPATH</b>  is  set  to  the  top-level
           directory  of  the  package  being  built.   This  has the effect of removing the build path from any
           generated file.

           If both <b>fixdebugpath</b> and <b>fixfilepath</b> are set, this option takes precedence, because it is a  superset
           of the former.

           <b>Note</b>:  If the build process captures the build flags into the resulting built objects, that will make
           the package unreproducible.  And  while  disabling  this  option  might  make  some  of  the  objects
           reproducible  again  this  would  also require disabling <b>fixdebugpath</b>, which might make any generated
           debug symbols objects unreproducible.  The ideal fix is to stop capturing build flags.

       <b>fixdebugpath</b>
           This      setting      (since      dpkg      1.18.5;       enabled       by       default)       adds
           <b>-fdebug-prefix-map=</b><u>BUILDPATH</u><b>=<a href="file:/usr/src/">/usr/src/</a></b><u>PKGNAME-PKGVER</u>  to  <b>CFLAGS</b>,  <b>CXXFLAGS</b>,  <b>OBJCFLAGS</b>, <b>OBJCXXFLAGS</b>,
           <b>FFLAGS</b> and <b>FCFLAGS</b> where <b>BUILDPATH</b> is set to the top-level directory  of  the  package  being  built.
           This has the effect of removing the build path from any generated debug symbols and replacing it with
           <u>/usr/src/PKGNAME-PKGVER</u>,  where  <u>PKGNAME</u>  is the source package name and <u>PKGVER</u> is the source package
           version.

           <b>Note</b>: This feature has similar reproducible properties as <b>fixfilepath</b>.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       There are 2 sets of environment variables doing the same operations, the first one  (DEB_<u>flag</u>_<u>op</u>)  should
       never be used within <b>debian/rules</b>.  It's meant for any user that wants to rebuild the source package with
       different build flags.  The second set (DEB_<u>flag</u>_MAINT_<u>op</u>) should only be used in <b>debian/rules</b> by package
       maintainers to change the resulting build flags.

       <b>DEB_</b><u>flag</u><b>_SET</b>
       <b>DEB_</b><u>flag</u><b>_MAINT_SET</b> (since dpkg 1.16.1)
           This variable can be used to force the value returned for the given <u>flag</u>.

       <b>DEB_</b><u>flag</u><b>_STRIP</b> (since dpkg 1.16.1)
       <b>DEB_</b><u>flag</u><b>_MAINT_STRIP</b> (since dpkg 1.16.1)
           This variable can be used to provide a space separated list of options that will be stripped from the
           set of flags returned for the given <u>flag</u>.

       <b>DEB_</b><u>flag</u><b>_APPEND</b>
       <b>DEB_</b><u>flag</u><b>_MAINT_APPEND</b> (since dpkg 1.16.1)
           This variable can be used to append supplementary options to the value returned for the given <u>flag</u>.

       <b>DEB_</b><u>flag</u><b>_PREPEND</b> (since dpkg 1.16.1)
       <b>DEB_</b><u>flag</u><b>_MAINT_PREPEND</b> (since dpkg 1.16.1)
           This variable can be used to prepend supplementary options to the value returned for the given <u>flag</u>.

       <b>DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS</b>
       <b>DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS</b> (since dpkg 1.16.1)
           These  variables  can  be  used  by a user or maintainer to disable/enable various area features that
           affect  build  flags.   The  <b>DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS</b>  variable   overrides   any   setting   in   the
           <b>DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS</b> feature areas.  See the "FEATURE AREAS" section for details.

       <b>DEB_VENDOR</b>
           This  setting defines the current vendor.  If not set, it will discover the current vendor by reading
           <b><a href="file:/etc/dpkg/origins/default">/etc/dpkg/origins/default</a></b>.

       <b>DEB_BUILD_PATH</b>
           This variable sets the build path (since dpkg 1.18.8) to use in features such as <b>fixfilepath</b> so  that
           they can be controlled by the caller.  This variable is currently Debian and derivatives-specific.

       <b>DEB_BUILD_DEBUGPATH</b>
           This  variable  sets  the  debug  build  path  (since  dpkg 1.21.9ubuntu2) to use in features such as
           <b>fixdebugpath</b> so that they can be controlled by  the  caller.   This  variable  is  currently  Ubuntu-
           specific.

       <b>DEB_HOST_ARCH</b>
           Sets  the  host  architecture.   This  affects  the  build flags that are emitted, which is typically
           relevant when cross-compiling, where <b>DEB_HOST_ARCH</b> is different to <b>DEB_BUILD_ARCH</b>.

       <b>DPKG_COLORS</b>
           Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5).  The currently accepted values are: <b>auto</b>  (default),  <b>always</b>
           and <b>never</b>.

       <b>DPKG_NLS</b>
           If  set,  it  will  be  used  to  decide  whether  to activate Native Language Support, also known as
           internationalization (or i18n) support (since dpkg  1.19.0).   The  accepted  values  are:  <b>0</b>  and  <b>1</b>
           (default).

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Configuration</b> <b>files</b>
       <b>/etc/dpkg/buildflags.conf</b>
           System wide configuration file.

       <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dpkg/buildflags.conf</b> or
       <b>$HOME/.config/dpkg/buildflags.conf</b>
           User configuration file.

   <b>Packaging</b> <b>support</b>
       <b>/usr/share/dpkg/buildflags.mk</b>
           Makefile  snippet  that  loads  (and  optionally  export) all flags supported by <b>dpkg-buildflags</b> into
           variables (since dpkg 1.16.1).

       <b>/usr/share/dpkg/buildtools.mk</b>
           Makefile snippet that sets suitable host and build tools (and optionally export them) into  variables
           (since dpkg 1.19.0).

   <b>LTO</b> <b>exclusion</b> <b>list</b>
       <b>/usr/share/lto-disabled-list/lto-disabled-list</b>
           A  text file, listing source packages and architectures where LTO should not be enabled, allowing the
           package to build without modifying it.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To pass build flags to a build command in a Makefile:

        $(MAKE) $(shell dpkg-buildflags --export=cmdline)

        ./configure $(shell dpkg-buildflags --export=cmdline)

       To set build flags in a shell script or shell fragment, <b>eval</b> can be used to interpret the output  and  to
       export the flags in the environment:

        eval "$(dpkg-buildflags --export=sh)" &amp;&amp; make

       or to set the positional parameters to pass to a command:

        eval "set -- $(dpkg-buildflags --export=cmdline)"
        for dir in a b c; do (cd $dir &amp;&amp; ./configure "$@" &amp;&amp; make); done

   <b>Usage</b> <b>in</b> <b>debian/rules</b>
       You  should call <b>dpkg-buildflags</b> or include <b>buildflags.mk</b> from the <b>debian/rules</b> file to obtain the needed
       build flags to pass to the build system.  Note that older  versions  of  <b>dpkg-buildpackage</b>  (before  dpkg
       1.16.1)  exported  these  flags  automatically.   However, you should not rely on this, since this breaks
       manual invocation of <b>debian/rules</b>.

       For packages with autoconf-like build systems, you can pass the relevant options to configure or  <b><a href="../man1/make.1.html">make</a></b>(1)
       directly, as shown above.

       For  other  build systems, or when you need more fine-grained control about which flags are passed where,
       you can use <b>--get</b>.  Or you can include <b>buildflags.mk</b> instead, which takes care of calling <b>dpkg-buildflags</b>
       and storing the build flags in make variables.

       If you want to export all buildflags into the environment (where they can be  picked  up  by  your  build
       system):

        DPKG_EXPORT_BUILDFLAGS = 1
        include /usr/share/dpkg/buildflags.mk

       For some extra control over what is exported, you can manually export the variables (as none are exported
       by default):

        include /usr/share/dpkg/buildflags.mk
        export CPPFLAGS CFLAGS LDFLAGS

       And you can of course pass the flags to commands manually:

        include /usr/share/dpkg/buildflags.mk
        build-arch:
               $(CC) -o hello hello.c $(CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS)
