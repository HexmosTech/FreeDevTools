</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dpkg-repack - put an unpacked .deb file back together

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dpkg-repack</b> [<u>option</u>...] <u>package-name</u>...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dpkg-repack</b> creates a .deb file out of a Debian package that has already been installed on your system.

       If any changes have been made to the package while it was unpacked (e.g.  conffiles files in <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>
       modified), the new package will inherit the changes.  (There are exceptions to this, including changes to
       configuration files that are not conffiles, including those managed by <b><a href="../man1/ucf.1.html">ucf</a></b>(1).)

       This utility can make it easy to copy packages from one computer to another, or to recreate packages that
       are installed on your system, but no longer available elsewhere.

       Note: <b>dpkg-repack</b> will place the created package in the current directory.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--root=</b><u>dir</u>
           Take package from filesystem rooted on <u>dir</u>. This is useful if, for example, you have another computer
           NFS mounted on <u><a href="file:/mnt">/mnt</a></u>, then you can use <b>--root=<a href="file:/mnt">/mnt</a></b> to reassemble packages from that computer.

       <b>--arch=</b><u>architecture</u>
           Make  the  package  be  for  a  specific  <u>architecture</u>.  <b>dpkg-repack</b>  might not be able to tell if an
           installed package is architecture <b>all</b> or is specific to the system's architecture, in case  it  lacks
           the  <b>Architecture</b> field. If you know the package architecture, you can use this option to force <b>dpkg-</b>
           <b>repack</b> to use the right architecture.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--deb-option=</b><u>option</u>
           Pass <u>option</u> as build argument to <b>dpkg-deb</b>. This option can be specified multiple times.

       <b>--generate</b>
           Generate a temporary directory suitable for building a package from, but do not actually  create  the
           package.  This  is  useful  if  you  want to move files around in the package before building it. The
           package can be built from this temporary directory by running "<b>dpkg-deb</b> <b>--build</b> <u>dir</u> <b>.</b>" as root (or by
           using <b>fakeroot</b> <b>-u</b>), where <u>dir</u> is the generated directory.

       <b>--tag=</b><u>thing</u>[,...]
           Specify a comma-separated list of things to tag in the package as having been repackaged. The current
           list of <u>thing</u>s to tag is:

           <b>none</b>
             Tag nothing. This can be specified first to be augmented by more specific <u>thing</u>s.

           <b>description</b>
             Append a timestamped "Repackaged by dpkg-repack" tagline to the package's control file  <b>Description</b>
             field. This tag is enabled by default.

           <b>version</b>
             Append a "+repack" tag to the package version.

           <b>all</b>
             Tag everything.

       <u>package-name</u>
           The name of the package to attempt to repack. Multiple packages can be listed.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       There  is a tricky situation that can occur if you <b>dpkg-repack</b> a package that has modified conffiles. The
       modified conffiles are packed up. Now if you install the package,  <b><a href="../man1/dpkg.1.html">dpkg</a></b>(1)  does  not  realize  that  the
       conffiles  in  it  are  modified.  So  if you later upgrade to a new version of the package, <b><a href="../man1/dpkg.1.html">dpkg</a></b>(1) will
       believe that the old (repacked) package has older conffiles than  the  new  version,  and  will  silently
       replace the conffiles with those in the package you are upgrading to.

       While  <b>dpkg-repack</b>  can be run under <b><a href="../man1/fakeroot.1.html">fakeroot</a></b>(1) and will work most of the time, <b>fakeroot</b> <b>-u</b> must be used
       if any of the files to be repacked are owned by non-root users. Otherwise  the  package  will  have  them
       owned by root. <b>dpkg-repack</b> will warn if you run it under <b><a href="../man1/fakeroot.1.html">fakeroot</a></b>(1) without the <b>-u</b> flag.
