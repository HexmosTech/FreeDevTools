</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dpkg-query - a tool to query the dpkg database

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dpkg-query</b> [<u>option</u>...] <u>command</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dpkg-query</b> is a tool to show information about packages listed in the <b>dpkg</b> database.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-l</b>, <b>--list</b> [<u>package-name-pattern</u>...]
           List all known packages matching one or more patterns, regardless of their status, which includes any
           real  or  virtual  package referenced in any dependency relationship field (such as <b>Breaks</b>, <b>Enhances</b>,
           etc.).  If no <u>package-name-pattern</u> is given, list all packages in <u><a href="file:/var/lib/dpkg/status">/var/lib/dpkg/status</a></u>, excluding the
           ones marked as not-installed (i.e.  those which have been previously purged).  Normal shell  wildcard
           characters are allowed in <u>package-name-pattern</u>.  Please note you will probably have to quote <u>package-</u>
           <u>name-pattern</u> to prevent the shell from performing filename expansion.  For example this will list all
           package names starting with “libc6”:

            dpkg-query -l 'libc6*'

           The  first  three  columns  of the output show the desired action, the package status, and errors, in
           that order.

           Desired action:

           u = Unknown
           i = Install
           h = Hold
           r = Remove
           p = Purge

           Package status:

           n = Not-installed
           c = Config-files
           H = Half-installed
           U = Unpacked
           F = Half-configured
           W = Triggers-awaiting
           t = Triggers-pending
           i = Installed

           Error flags:

           &lt;empty&gt; = (none)
           R = Reinst-required

           An uppercase status or error letter indicates the package is likely to cause severe problems.  Please
           refer to <b><a href="../man1/dpkg.1.html">dpkg</a></b>(1) for information about the above states and flags.

           The output format of this option is not configurable, but varies automatically to  fit  the  terminal
           width.   It  is  intended for human readers, and is not easily machine-readable.  See <b>-W</b> (<b>--show</b>) and
           <b>--showformat</b> for a way to configure the output format.

       <b>-W</b>, <b>--show</b> [<u>package-name-pattern</u>...]
           Just like the <b>--list</b> option this will list all packages matching the  given  patterns.   However  the
           output can be customized using the <b>--showformat</b> option.

           The  default  output  format gives one line per matching package, each line consisting of the package
           name and its installed version, separated by a tab.  The package name will be architecture  qualified
           for  packages with a <b>Multi-Arch</b> field with the value <b>same</b> or with a foreign architecture, which is an
           architecture that is neither the native one nor <b>all</b>.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--status</b> [<u>package-name</u>...]
           Report status of specified packages.  This just displays the entry in the  installed  package  status
           database.  If no <u>package-name</u> is specified it will display all package entries in the status database
           (since dpkg 1.19.1).  When multiple <u>package-name</u> entries are listed, the requested status entries are
           separated by an empty line, with the same order as specified on the argument list.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--listfiles</b> <u>package-name</u>...
           List  files  installed to your system from <u>package-name</u>.  When multiple <u>package-name</u>s are listed, the
           requested lists of files are separated by an empty line, with the same  order  as  specified  on  the
           argument list.

           Each  file  diversion  is  printed  on its own line after its diverted file, prefixed with one of the
           following localized strings:

             locally diverted to: <u>diverted-to</u>
             package diverts others to: <u>diverted-to</u>
             diverted by <u>pkg</u> to: <u>diverted-to</u>

           <b>Hint</b>: When machine parsing the output,  it  is  customary  to  set  the  locale  to  <b>C.UTF-8</b>  to  get
           reproducible  results.   On  some  systems  this might also require adapting the <b>LANGUAGE</b> environment
           variable appropriately if it is already set (see <b><a href="../man7/locale.7.html">locale</a></b>(7)).

           This command will not list extra files created by maintainer scripts, nor will it list alternatives.

       <b>--control-list</b> <u>package-name</u>
           List control files installed to your system from <u>package-name</u> (since dpkg 1.16.5).  These can be used
           as input arguments to <b>--control-show</b>.

       <b>--control-show</b> <u>package-name</u> <u>control-file</u>
           Print the <u>control-file</u> installed to your system from <u>package-name</u> to the standard output (since  dpkg
           1.16.5).

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--control-path</b> <u>package-name</u> [<u>control-file</u>]
           List  paths  for  control  files  installed to your system from <u>package-name</u> (since dpkg 1.15.4).  If
           <u>control-file</u> is specified then only list the path for that control file if it is present.

           <b>Warning</b>: This command is deprecated as it gives direct access to the internal dpkg  database,  please
           switch to use <b>--control-list</b> and <b>--control-show</b> instead for all cases where those commands might give
           the  same  end  result.   Although, as long as there is still at least one case where this command is
           needed (i.e. when having to remove a damaging postrm maintainer script), and while there is  no  good
           solution for that, this command will not get removed.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--search</b> <u>filename-search-pattern</u>...
           Search  for  packages  that  own  files corresponding to the given patterns.  Standard shell wildcard
           characters can be used in the pattern, where asterisk (<b>*</b>) and question mark (<b>?</b>) will match  a  slash,
           and backslash (<b>\</b>) will be used as an escape character.

           If  the first character in the <u>filename-search-pattern</u> is none of ‘<b>*[?/</b>’ then it will be considered a
           substring match and will be implicitly surrounded by ‘<b>*</b>’ (as in <b>*</b><u>filename-search-pattern</u><b>*</b>).   If  the
           subsequent  string  contains  any  of ‘<b>*[?\</b>’, then it will handled like a glob pattern, otherwise any
           trailing ‘<b>/</b>’ or ‘<b><a href="file:/.">/.</a></b>’ will be removed and a literal path lookup will be performed.

           This command will not list extra files created by maintainer scripts, nor will it list alternatives.

           The output format consists of one line per matching pattern, with  a  list  of  packages  owning  the
           pathname separated by a comma (U+002C ‘<b>,</b>’) and a space (U+0020 ‘ ’), followed by a colon (U+003A ‘<b>:</b>’)
           and a space, followed by the pathname.  As in:

             pkgname1, pkgname2: pathname1
             pkgname3: pathname2

           File diversions are printed with the following localized strings:

             diversion by <u>pkgname</u> from: <u>diverted-from</u>
             diversion by <u>pkgname</u> to: <u>diverted-to</u>

           or for local diversions:

             local diversion from: <u>diverted-from</u>
             local diversion to: <u>diverted-to</u>

           <b>Hint</b>:  When  machine  parsing  the  output,  it  is  customary  to  set  the locale to <b>C.UTF-8</b> to get
           reproducible results.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--print-avail</b> [<u>package-name</u>...]
           Display details  about  packages,  as  found  in  <u><a href="file:/var/lib/dpkg/available">/var/lib/dpkg/available</a></u>.   If  no  <u>package-name</u>  is
           specified,  it  will display all package entries in the <u>available</u> database (since dpkg 1.19.1).  When
           multiple <u>package-name</u> are listed, the requested <u>available</u> entries are separated  by  an  empty  line,
           with the same order as specified on the argument list.

           Users  of  APT-based frontends should use <b>apt</b> <b>show</b> <u>package-name</u> instead as the <u>available</u> file is only
           kept up-to-date when using <b>dselect</b>.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show the usage message and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Show the version and exit.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--admindir=</b><u>dir</u>
           Change the location of the <b>dpkg</b> database.  The default location is <u><a href="file:/var/lib/dpkg">/var/lib/dpkg</a></u>.

       <b>--root=</b><u>directory</u>
           Set   the   root   directory   to   <u>directory</u>,   which   sets   the   administrative   directory   to
           «<u>directory</u><a href="file:/var/lib/dpkg">/var/lib/dpkg</a>» (since dpkg 1.21.0).

       <b>--load-avail</b>
           Also  load  the  available  file when using the <b>--show</b> and <b>--list</b> commands, which now default to only
           querying the status file (since dpkg 1.16.2).

       <b>--no-pager</b>
           Disables the use of any pager when showing information (since dpkg 1.19.2).

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--showformat=</b><u>format</u>
           This option is used to specify the format of the output <b>--show</b> will produce (short option since  dpkg
           1.13.1).  The format is a string that will be output for each package listed.

           In the format string, “<b>\</b>” introduces escapes:

           <b>\n</b> newline
           <b>\r</b> carriage return
           <b>\t</b> tab

           “<b>\</b>”  before  any  other character suppresses any special meaning of the following character, which is
           useful for “<b>\</b>” and “<b>$</b>”.

           Package information can be included by inserting variable references  to  package  fields  using  the
           syntax  “<b>${</b><u>field</u>[<b>;</b><u>width</u>]<b>}</b>”.   Fields  are printed right-aligned unless the width is negative in which
           case left alignment will be used.  The following <u>field</u>s are recognized but they are  not  necessarily
           available  in  the status file (only internal fields or fields stored in the binary package end up in
           it):

           <b>Triggers-Pending</b> (internal)
           <b>Version</b>

           The following are virtual fields, generated by <b>dpkg-query</b> from values from other  fields  (note  that
           these do not use valid names for fields in control files):

           <b>binary:Package</b>
               It  contains  the  binary  package name with a possible architecture qualifier like “libc6:amd64”
               (since dpkg 1.16.2).  An architecture  qualifier  will  be  present  to  make  the  package  name
               unambiguous,  for  packages  with  a  <b>Multi-Arch</b>  field  with  the  value  <b>same</b> or with a foreign
               architecture, which is an architecture that is neither the native one nor <b>all</b>.

           <b>binary:Synopsis</b>
               It contains the package short description (since dpkg 1.19.1).

           <b>binary:Summary</b>
               This is an alias for <b>binary:Synopsis</b> (since dpkg 1.16.2).

           <b>db:Status-Abbrev</b>
               It contains the abbreviated package status (as three characters), such as “ii ” or  “iHR”  (since
               dpkg 1.16.2).  See the <b>--list</b> command description for more details.

           <b>db:Status-Want</b>
               It contains the package wanted status, part of the Status field (since dpkg 1.17.11).

           <b>db:Status-Status</b>
               It contains the package status word, part of the Status field (since dpkg 1.17.11).

           <b>db:Status-Eflag</b>
               It contains the package status error flag, part of the Status field (since dpkg 1.17.11).

           <b>db-fsys:Files</b>
               It contains the list of the package filesystem entries separated by newlines (since dpkg 1.19.3).

           <b>db-fsys:Last-Modified</b>
               It  contains  the  timestamp  in  seconds  of  the  last time the package filesystem entries were
               modified (since dpkg 1.19.3).

           <b>source:Package</b>
               It contains the source package name for this binary package (since dpkg 1.16.2).

           <b>source:Version</b>
               It contains the source package version for this binary package (since dpkg 1.16.2)

           <b>source:Upstream-Version</b>
               It contains the source package upstream version for this binary package (since dpkg 1.18.16)

           The default format string is “<b>${binary:Package}\t${Version}\n</b>”.  Actually, all other fields found  in
           the  status  file  (i.e.  user  defined  fields)  can be requested, too.  They will be printed as-is,
           though, no conversion nor error checking is done on them.  To get the name of the <b>dpkg</b> maintainer and
           the installed version, you could run:

            dpkg-query -f='${binary:Package} ${Version}\t${Maintainer}\n' \
             -W dpkg

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>0</b>   The requested query was successfully performed.

       <b>1</b>   The requested query failed either fully or partially, due to no file or package being  found  (except
           for <b>--control-path</b>, <b>--control-list</b> and <b>--control-show</b> were such errors are fatal).

       <b>2</b>   Fatal or unrecoverable error due to invalid command-line usage, or interactions with the system, such
           as accesses to the database, memory allocations, etc.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
   <b>External</b> <b>environment</b>
       <b>SHELL</b>
           Sets the program to execute when spawning a command via a shell (since dpkg 1.19.2).

       <b>PAGER</b>
       <b>DPKG_PAGER</b>
           Sets the pager command to use (since dpkg 1.19.1), which will be executed with «<b>$SHELL</b> <b>-c</b>».  If <b>SHELL</b>
           is not set, «<b>sh</b>» will be used instead.

           The <b>DPKG_PAGER</b> overrides the <b>PAGER</b> environment variable (since dpkg 1.19.2).  If none of the programs
           pointed by <b>DPKG_PAGER</b> or <b>PAGER</b> are present, the following programs will be tried in order (since dpkg
           1.22.12): the default pager <b>pager</b>, then <b>less</b>, <b>more</b>, and finally <b>cat</b>.

       <b>DPKG_ROOT</b>
           If set and the <b>--root</b> option has not been specified, it will be used as the filesystem root directory
           (since dpkg 1.21.0).

       <b>DPKG_ADMINDIR</b>
           If set and the <b>--admindir</b> option has not been specified, it will be used as the <b>dpkg</b> data directory.

       <b>DPKG_DEBUG</b>
           Sets  the  debug  mask  (since  dpkg  1.21.10) from an octal value.  The currently accepted flags are
           described in the <b>dpkg</b> <b>--debug</b> option, but not all these flags might have an effect on this program.

       <b>DPKG_COLORS</b>
           Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5).  The currently accepted values are: <b>auto</b>  (default),  <b>always</b>
           and <b>never</b>.

       <b>DPKG_NLS</b>
           If  set,  it  will  be  used  to  decide  whether  to activate Native Language Support, also known as
           internationalization (or i18n) support (since dpkg  1.22.7).   The  accepted  values  are:  <b>0</b>  and  <b>1</b>
           (default).

   <b>Internal</b> <b>environment</b>
       <b>LESS</b>
           Defined  by  <b>dpkg-query</b>  to “<b>-FRSXMQ</b>”, if not already set, when spawning a pager (since dpkg 1.19.2).
           To change the default behavior, this variable can be preset to some other value  including  an  empty
           string,  or  the  <b>PAGER</b> or <b>DPKG_PAGER</b> variables can be set to disable specific options with «<b>-+</b>», for
           example <b>DPKG_PAGER="less</b> <b>-+F"</b>.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b></h4><pre>
       Query operations should never require root, and delegating their execution to unprivileged users via some
       gain-root command can have security implications (such as privilege escalation), for example when a pager
       is automatically invoked by the tool.
