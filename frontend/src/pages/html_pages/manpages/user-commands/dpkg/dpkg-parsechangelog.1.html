       dpkg-parsechangelog - parse Debian changelog files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dpkg-parsechangelog</b> [<u>option</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dpkg-parsechangelog</b> reads and parses the changelog of an unpacked Debian source tree and outputs the
       information in it to standard output in a machine-readable form.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-l</b>, <b>--file</b> <u>changelog-file</u>
           Specifies  the  changelog  file  to read information from.  A ‘-’ can be used to specify reading from
           standard input.  The default is <b>debian/changelog</b>.

       <b>-F</b> <u>changelog-format</u>
           Specifies the format of the changelog.  By default the format is read from a special  line  near  the
           bottom  of the changelog or failing that defaults to the <b>debian</b> standard format.  See also "CHANGELOG
           FORMATS".

       <b>-L</b> <u>libdir</u>
           Obsolete option without effect (since dpkg 1.18.8).  Setting the perl environment variables  <b>PERL5LIB</b>
           or <b>PERLLIB</b> has a similar effect when looking for the parser perl modules.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--show-field</b> <u>field</u>
           Specifies the name of the field to show (since dpkg 1.17.0).  The field name is not printed, only its
           value.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show the usage message and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Show the version and exit.

   <b>Parser</b> <b>Options</b>
       The  following options can be used to influence the output of the changelog parser, for example the range
       of entries or the format of the output.

       <b>--format</b> <u>output-format</u>
           Set the output format.  Currently supported values are <b>dpkg</b> and <b>rfc822</b>.  <b>dpkg</b> is the  classic  output
           format  (from  before  this  option  existed)  and  the default.  It consists of one stanza in Debian
           control format (see <b><a href="../man5/deb-control.5.html">deb-control</a></b>(5)).  If more than one entry is requested, then most fields are taken
           from the first entry (usually the most recent entry), except otherwise stated:

           <b>Source:</b> <u>pkg-name</u>
               The source package name.

           <b>Version:</b> <u>version</u>
               The source version number.  <b>Note</b>: For binary-only releases there might be no corresponding source
               release.

           <b>Distribution:</b> <u>target-distribution</u>
               A space-separated list of one or more distribution names where this version should  be  installed
               when it is uploaded.

           <b>Urgency:</b> <u>urgency</u>
               The  highest  urgency  of  all  included  entries  is  used, followed by the concatenated (space-
               separated) comments from all the versions requested.

           <b>Maintainer:</b> <u>author</u>
               The name and email address of the person who prepared these changes,  they  are  <b>not</b>  necessarily
               those of the uploader or the usual package maintainer.

           <b>Date:</b> <u>date</u>
               The  date  of  the  entry as a string, as it appears in the changelog.  With a <b><a href="../man3/strptime.3.html">strptime</a></b>(3) format
               "<b>%a,</b> <b>%d</b> <b>%b</b> <b>%Y</b> <b>%T</b> <b>%z</b>", but where the day of the week might not actually correspond to the real day
               obtained from the rest of the date string.  If you need a more  accurate  representation  of  the
               date,  use  the <b>Timestamp</b> field, but take into account it might not be possible to map it back to
               the exact value in this field.

           <b>Timestamp:</b> <u>timestamp</u>
               The date of the entry as a timestamp in seconds since the epoch (since dpkg 1.18.8).

           <b>Closes:</b> <u>bug-number</u>
               The Closes fields of all included entries are merged.

           <b>Changes:</b> <u>changelog-entries</u>
               The text of all changelog entries is concatenated.  To make this field  a  valid  Debian  control
               format multiline field empty lines are replaced with a single full stop and all lines is intended
               by one space character.  The exact content depends on the changelog format.

           The <b>Version</b>, <b>Distribution</b>, <b>Urgency</b>, <b>Maintainer</b> and <b>Changes</b> fields are mandatory.

           There might be additional user-defined fields present.

           The <b>rfc822</b> format uses the same fields but outputs a separate stanza for each changelog entry so that
           all metadata for each entry is preserved.

       <b>--reverse</b>
           Include all changes in reverse order (since dpkg 1.19.1).

           <b>Note</b>: For the <b>dpkg</b> format the first entry will be the most ancient entry.

       <b>--all</b>
           Include all changes.  <b>Note</b>: Other options have no effect when this is in use.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--since</b> <u>version</u>
       <b>-v</b> <u>version</u>
           Include all changes later than <u>version</u>.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--until</b> <u>version</u>
           Include all changes earlier than <u>version</u>.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--from</b> <u>version</u>
           Include all changes equal or later than <u>version</u>.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--to</b> <u>version</u>
           Include all changes up to or equal than <u>version</u>.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--count</b> <u>number</u>
       <b>-n</b> <u>number</u>
           Include <u>number</u> entries from the top (or the tail if <u>number</u> is lower than 0).

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--offset</b> <u>number</u>
           Change the starting point for <b>--count</b>, counted from the top (or the tail if <u>number</u> is lower than 0).

</pre><h4><b>CHANGELOG</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       It  is possible to use a different format to the standard one, by providing a parser for that alternative
       format.

       In order to have <b>dpkg-parsechangelog</b> run the new parser, a line must be included within the last 40 lines
       of the changelog file, matching the Perl regular expression: “<b>\schangelog-format:\s+([0-9a-z]+)\W</b>”.   The
       part in parentheses should be the name of the format.  For example:

           @@@ changelog-format: <u>otherformat</u> @@@

       Changelog format names are non-empty strings of lowercase alphanumerics (“a-z0-9”).

       If such a line exists then <b>dpkg-parsechangelog</b> will look for the parser as a <b>Dpkg::Changelog::</b><u>Otherformat</u>
       perl  module;  it  is  an  error  for  it  not being present.  The parser name in the perl module will be
       automatically capitalized.  The default changelog format is <b>debian</b>, and a parser for it  is  provided  by
       default.

       The  parser  should  be  derived  from  the  Dpkg::Changelog  class and implement the required documented
       interface.

       If the changelog format which is being parsed always  or  almost  always  leaves  a  blank  line  between
       individual  change  notes,  these  blank lines should be stripped out, so as to make the resulting output
       compact.

       If the changelog format does not contain date or package name  information  this  information  should  be
       omitted from the output.  The parser should not attempt to synthesize it or find it from other sources.

       If  the  changelog  does  not have the expected format the parser should error out, rather than trying to
       muddle through and possibly generating incorrect output.

       A changelog parser may not interact with the user at all.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       All <b>Parser</b> <b>Options</b> except for <b>-v</b> are only supported since dpkg 1.14.16.

       Short option parsing with non-bundled values available only since dpkg 1.18.0.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DPKG_COLORS</b>
           Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5).  The currently accepted values are: <b>auto</b>  (default),  <b>always</b>
           and <b>never</b>.

       <b>DPKG_NLS</b>
           If  set,  it  will  be  used  to  decide  whether  to activate Native Language Support, also known as
           internationalization (or i18n) support (since dpkg  1.19.0).   The  accepted  values  are:  <b>0</b>  and  <b>1</b>
           (default).

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>debian/changelog</b>
           The  changelog  file,  used to obtain version-dependent information about the source package, such as
           the urgency and distribution of an upload, the changes made  since  a  particular  release,  and  the
           source version number itself.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>Maintainer</b> field has a confusing name matching the field in the <u>debian/control</u> file but not its exact
       semantics,  where  its  meaning  would  be  better  represented  by the <b>Changed-By</b> field name used in the
       <u>.changes</u> file.
