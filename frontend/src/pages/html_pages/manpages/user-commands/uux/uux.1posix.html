</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       uux — remote command execution

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       uux <b>[</b>-jnp<b>]</b> <u>command-string</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>uux</u>  utility  shall  gather  zero  or more files from various systems, execute a shell pipeline (see
       <u>Section</u> <u>2.9</u>, <u>Shell</u> <u>Commands</u>) on a specified system, and then send the standard output of the command to a
       file on a specified system. Only the first command of a pipeline can have  a  <u>system-name</u>!   prefix.  All
       other commands in the pipeline shall be executed on the system of the first command.

       The following restrictions are applicable to the shell pipeline processed by <u>uux</u>:

        *  In gathering files from different systems, pathname expansion shall not be performed by <u>uux</u>.  Thus, a
           request such as:

               uux "c99 remsys!~/*.c"

           would attempt to copy the file named literally <b>*.c</b> to the local system.

        *  The  redirection  operators  <b>"&gt;&gt;"</b>,  <b>"&lt;&lt;"</b>,  <b>"&gt;|"</b>,  and  <b>"&gt;&amp;"</b>  shall  not be accepted. Any use of these
           redirection operators shall cause this utility to write an error message describing the  problem  and
           exit with a non-zero exit status.

        *  The  reserved word <b>!</b>  cannot be used at the head of the pipeline to modify the exit status.  (See the
           <u>command-string</u> operand description below.)

        *  Alias substitution shall not be performed.

       A filename can be specified as for <u>uucp</u>; it can be an absolute pathname, a  pathname  preceded  by  ~<u>name</u>
       (which  is  replaced  by  the  corresponding  login  directory),  a pathname specified as ~/<u>dest</u> (<u>dest</u> is
       prefixed by the public directory called <u>PUBDIR</u>; the actual location of <u>PUBDIR</u> is implementation-defined),
       or a simple filename (which is prefixed by <u>uux</u> with the current directory). See <u>uucp</u> for the details.

       The execution of commands on remote systems shall take place in an execution directory known to the  <u>uucp</u>
       system.  All files required for the execution shall be put into this directory unless they already reside
       on that machine. Therefore, the application shall  ensure  that  non-local  filenames  (without  path  or
       machine reference) are unique within the <u>uux</u> request.

       The  <u>uux</u> utility shall attempt to get all files to the execution system. For files that are output files,
       the application shall ensure that the filename is escaped using parentheses.

       The remote system shall notify the user by mail if  the  requested  command  on  the  remote  system  was
       disallowed or the files were not accessible. This notification can be turned off by the <b>-n</b> option.

       Typical  implementations  of  this  utility  require  a  communications  line  configured to use the Base
       Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Chapter</u> <u>11</u>, <u>General</u>  <u>Terminal</u>  <u>Interface</u>,  but  other  communications
       means  may  be  used. On systems where there are no available communications means (either temporarily or
       permanently), this utility shall write an error message describing the problem and exit with  a  non-zero
       exit status.

       The  <u>uux</u>  utility cannot guarantee support for all character encodings in all circumstances. For example,
       transmission data may be restricted to 7 bits by the underlying network, 8-bit data  and  filenames  need
       not be portable to non-internationalized systems, and so on. Under these circumstances, it is recommended
       that only characters defined in the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard International Reference Version (equivalent
       to  ASCII)  7-bit  range  of characters be used and that only characters defined in the portable filename
       character set be used for naming files.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>uux</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>12.2</u>,  <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-j</b>        Write  the job identification string to standard output. This job identification can be used by
                 <u>uustat</u> to obtain the status or terminate a job.

       <b>-n</b>        Do not notify the user if the command fails.

       <b>-p</b>        Make the standard input to <u>uux</u> the standard input to the <u>command-string</u>.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <u>command-string</u>
                 A string made up of one or more arguments that are similar to normal command arguments,  except
                 that  the  command and any filenames can be prefixed by <u>system-name</u>!.  A null <u>system-name</u> shall
                 be interpreted as the local system.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       The standard input shall not be used unless the <b>'-'</b> or <b>-p</b>  option  is  specified;  in  those  cases,  the
       standard input shall be made the standard input of the <u>command-string</u>.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Input files shall be selected according to the contents of <u>command-string</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>uux</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> for the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used  to affect the format and contents of diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       The standard output shall not be used  unless  the  <b>-j</b>  option  is  specified;  in  that  case,  the  job
       identification string shall be written to standard output in the following format:

           "%s\n", &lt;<u>jobid</u>&gt;

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Output files shall be created or written, or both, according to the contents of <u>command-string</u>.

       If  <b>-n</b>  is  not  used,  mail files shall be modified following any command or file-access failures on the
       remote system.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       This utility is part of the UUCP Utilities option and need not be supported by all implementations.

       Note that, for security reasons, many installations limit the list of commands executable on behalf of an
       incoming request from <u>uux</u>.  Many sites permit little more than the receipt of mail via <u>uux</u>.

       Any characters special to the command interpreter should be quoted either by quoting the entire  <u>command-</u>
       <u>string</u> or quoting the special characters as individual arguments.

       As  noted  in <u>uucp</u>, shell pattern matching notation characters appearing in pathnames are expanded on the
       appropriate local system. This is done under the control of local settings of  <u>LC_COLLATE</u>  and  <u>LC_CTYPE</u>.
       Thus, care should be taken when using bracketed filename patterns, as collation and typing rules may vary
       from one system to another. Also be aware that certain types of expression (that is, equivalence classes,
       character classes, and collating symbols) need not be supported on non-internationalized systems.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
        1. The  following  command  gets <b>file1</b> from system <b>a</b> and <b>file2</b> from system <b>b</b>, executes <u>diff</u> on the local
           system, and puts the results in <b>file.diff</b> in the local <u>PUBDIR</u> directory. (<u>PUBDIR</u> is the  <u>uucp</u>  public
           directory on the local system.)

               uux "!diff a!/usr/file1 b!/a4/file2 &gt;!<a href="file:~/file.diff">~/file.diff</a>"

        2. The  following  command  fails  because  <u>uux</u>  places all files copied to a system in the same working
           directory.  Although the files <b>xyz</b> are from two different systems, their filenames are the  same  and
           conflict.

               uux "!diff a!/usr1/xyz b!/usr2/xyz &gt;!<a href="file:~/xyz.diff">~/xyz.diff</a>"

        3. The  following  command  succeeds  (assuming <u>diff</u> is permitted on system <b>a</b>) because the file local to
           system <b>a</b> is not copied to the working directory, and hence does  not  conflict  with  the  file  from
           system <b>c</b>.

               uux "a!diff a!/usr/xyz c!/usr/xyz &gt;!<a href="file:~/xyz.diff">~/xyz.diff</a>"

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
