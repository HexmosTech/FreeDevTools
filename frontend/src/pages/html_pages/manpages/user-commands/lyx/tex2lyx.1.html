</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tex2lyx - translate well-behaved LaTeX into LyX

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       The  simplest  way  to  use  <b>tex2lyx</b>  is  via the File-&gt;Import-&gt;LaTeX (plain) menu item in LyX. That runs
       <b>tex2lyx</b> on the given file and loads the resulting file into LyX. You should try that first, and  call  it
       from the command line only if you need to use more complicated options.

       <b>tex2lyx</b>  [  <b>-userdir</b>  <u>userdir</u> ] [ <b>-systemdir</b> <u>systemdir</u> ] [ <b>-f</b> ] [ <b>-n</b> ] [ <b>-c</b> <u>textclass</u> ] [ <b>-e</b> <u>encoding</u> ] [
       <b>-fixedenc</b> <u>encoding</u> ] [ <b>-m</b> <u>module1</u>[,<u>module2</u>...]]  [ <b>-s</b> <u>sfile1</u>[,<u>sfile2</u>...]] [ <b>-skipchildren</b> ] [  <b>-roundtrip</b>
       ] [ <b>-copyfiles</b> ] <u>inputfile</u> [ <u>outputfile</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c</b>     Class. By default, when <b>tex2lyx</b> sees a \documentclass{foo} command, it creates a file of textclass
              “foo”    and    reads    the    LyX    layout    file    for    that    class    (something   like
              /usr/local/share/lyx/layouts/foo.layout OR <b>HOME</b>/.lyx/layouts/foo.layout).  Use  <b>-c</b>  to  declare  a
              different textclass (and read a different layout file).

              This  option  is  needed  if  the  input  file  is  a  LaTeX  fragment, with no preamble matter or
              \begin{document} command. LyX files created by <b>tex2lyx</b> from partial files can be  included  in  an
              existing LyX file using the “Include LyX File” command from LyX's Insert menu.

       <b>-m</b>     Module.  Load  the  given modules. This is useful if <b>tex2lyx</b> does not automatically detect a given
              module, but you know the modules that provide some commands or environments that are used  in  the
              imported file. The modules are loaded in the given order. If a module <u>foo</u> depends on a module <u>bar</u>,
              <u>bar</u> must be given before <u>foo</u>.

       <b>-f</b>     Force.  <b>tex2lyx</b> will not run if the .lyx file it would generate already exists.  Use the <b>-f</b> option
              (carefully) to clobber any existing files.

       <b>-e</b>     Specify the default encoding using the LaTeX name as defined in the encodings file.  <b>tex2lyx</b>  will
              use this encoding, but switch if it finds any encoding changing commands in the input.

       <b>-fixedenc</b>
              Specify  the  encoding using the LaTeX name as defined in the encodings file.  <b>tex2lyx</b> will ignore
              any encoding changing commands in the input.

       <b>-q</b>     Quite mode. <b>tex2lyx</b> will not output any warning messages.

       <b>-n</b>     Noweb. Translate a noweb (aka literate programming) file. This should be (almost?)  equivalent  to
              running “noweb2lyx foo.tex foo.lyx”. This option requires the <b>-c</b> option.

       <b>-skipchildren</b>
              Do  not  translate child documents included via \include and \input.  This option is useful if the
              child documents are generated files and/or contain many commands that <b>tex2lyx</b> does not  understand
              yet.

       <b>-s</b>     Syntax  files. Input (one or more quoted, comma-separated) syntax files to read in addition to the
              default. (see the section on <u>Syntax</u> <u>Files</u> for details).

       <b>-sysdir</b>
              Specify a system directory. Normally, you shouldn't  need  this.  Your  LyX  system  directory  is
              chosen. Cf. the section FILES for details.

       <b>-userdir</b>
              Specify  a  user  directory. Normally, you shouldn't need this. Your LyX user directory is chosen.
              Cf. the section FILES for details.

       <b>-roundtrip</b>
              Call LyX to re-export the created output file to LaTeX. If the output file name is not given it is
              determined automatically to avoid over-writing the input file by accident: If the  input  file  is
              named  <u>foo.tex</u>  the  output file will be named <u>foo.lyx.lyx</u>, and the re-exported file will be named
              <u>foo.lyx.tex</u>.

       <b>-copyfiles</b>
              Copy all included files <b>tex2lyx</b> is aware of to the output directory if the output file is  located
              in  a  different  directory  than  the  input  file.  This is useful if you want to ensure that no
              included file is overwritten (either in roundtrip mode or by a later export from LyX). Please note
              that the resulting document may be uncompilable. This happens if it needs files that <b>tex2lyx</b>  does
              not know about and therefore does not copy to the output directory.

       <b>-help</b>  Help. Print out usage information and quit.

       <b>-version</b>
              Print out the version number and build information and quit.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Introduction</b>
       <b>tex2lyx</b>  will  create  a  LyX file with the specified name (or <u>dir/foo.lyx</u> if no name was given) from the
       LaTeX file <u>dir/foo.tex</u>.

       Suffixes .tex, .ltx and .latex are supported. If <u>inputfile</u> does not exist and does not have one of  these
       suffixes, <b>tex2lyx</b> will try to translate <u>inputfile.tex</u>. (This is similar to the behavior of LaTeX.)

       The  purpose  of  <b>tex2lyx</b>  is  to  translate  <u>well-behaved</u>  LaTeX2e  into LyX. If your LaTeX file doesn't
       compile---or if you do weird things, like redefining standard LaTeX  commands---it  may  choke.  LaTeX209
       will often be translated correctly, but it's not guaranteed.

       <b>tex2lyx</b> lacks a few features. However, its main goals are:

       •   Get through a well-behaved LaTeX2e file without crashing

       •   Translate a lot of that file.

       •   Localize the parts that can't be translated and copy them in TeX mode

       It achieves these main goals pretty well on most files.

   <b>Usage</b>
       Here's a more lengthy description of what you should do to translate a LaTeX document into LyX.

       •   Run <b>tex2lyx</b>.

           <b>tex2lyx</b>  will  inform  you  of its progress and give any warnings to stderr, so if you don't want any
           output at all, try (in csh) `tex2lyx foo.tex &gt;&amp; /dev/null'.  You should NOT redirect standard  output
           to <u>foo.lyx</u>.

       •   Run LyX (version 2.1 or later) on the resulting .lyx file.

           In  theory,  most  of  the file will have been translated, and anything that's untranslatable will be
           transferred to TeX code (ERT in LyX-speak). In theory, LyX will be able to read in the file,  and  to
           create  printed  documents  from  it, because all that untranslated ERT stuff will be passed directly
           back to LaTeX, which LyX uses as a backend. Unfortunately, reality doesn't always reflect theory.  If
           <b>tex2lyx</b> crashes, or LyX cannot read the generated LyX file, see the BUGS section below.

       •   Transform things have been inserted as TeX code manually to LyX features, if possible.

           As  mentioned  above,  you should be able to print out the LyX file even without doing this. However,
           changing a command in TeX code to the corresponding LyX object will allow you to  take  advantage  of
           LyX's WYSIWYM editing.

           <b>tex2lyx</b>  is  not guaranteed to create a LyX file which generates exactly the same output as the LaTeX
           file, although its goal is to achieve this. <b>tex2lyx</b> will generally err on  the  side  of  translating
           less  to ensure that the resulting output files are accurate, even though this leads to more TeX code
           and less WYSIWYM.

       •   PROOFREAD THE DOCUMENT!!

           I'm sure you were planning on doing this anyway, but it's particularly important after translating  a
           LaTeX  document.  <b>tex2lyx</b>  is  better  at  “macro-translating”  (translating the whole document) than
           “micro-translating” (translating every little detail). For example,  you  may  see  extra  spaces  or
           deleted spaces. Space handling has improved, but it's not perfect.

   <b>What</b> <b>tex2lyx</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Handle</b>
       <b>tex2lyx</b> understands many LaTeX commands. It will translate:

       •   regular  text,  including  mini-commands  like  ~,  `', \@, \TeX, as well as accented characters like
           \'{a}, and the special cases ?` and !`

       •   title commands like \author, \date, \title, \thanks and the abstract environment

       •   heading commands like \section including starred commands (\section*)

       •   Environments: quote, quotation, and verse; center, flushright, and flushleft

       •   itemize, enumerate, and description environments,  and  their  \item  commands.   Also,  well-behaved
           nested lists

       •   cross-referencing commands: \ref, \pageref, \label, and \cite

       •   \footnote and \margin

       •   font-changing  commands  including  \em, \emph, \textit, and corresponding commands to change family,
           size, series, and shape

       •   \input{foo} (or \input{foo.blah}) and \include{foo}. Plain TeX \input  command  “\input  foo.tex”  is
           also supported.

       •   tabular  environment,  and  commands that go inside it like \hline, \cline, and \multicolumn (but see
           below)

       •   float environments table and table*, as well as \caption commands within them

       •   float environments figure and figure*, as well  as  graphics  inclusion  commands  \epsf,  \epsffile,
           \epsfbox, \epsfxsize, \epsfig, \psfig, and \includegraphics.  Both the graphics and graphicx forms of
           \includegraphics are supported.

       •   thebibliography   environment   and   \bibitem   command,  as  well  as  BibTeX's  \bibliography  and
           \bibliographystyle commands

       •   miscellaneous commands: \hfill, \\, \noindent, \ldots...

       •   documentclass-specific environments (and some commands) which can be translated to LyX layouts

       •   arguments to certain untranslatable commands (e.g. \mbox)

       Some of this support may not be 100% yet. See below for details

       <b>tex2lyx</b> copies math (almost) verbatim from your LaTeX file. Luckily, LyX reads in LaTeX math, so (almost)
       any math which is supported by LyX should work just fine.

       <b>tex2lyx</b> will copy any preamble commands (i.e., anything before \begin{document})  verbatim.  Fancy  stuff
       you've got in your preamble should thus be conserved in printed documents, although it will not of course
       show up in the LyX window. Check Document-&gt;Settings-&gt;LaTeX Preamble to see the result.

   <b>What</b> <b>tex2lyx</b> <b>Can't</b> <b>Handle</b> <b>---</b> <b>But</b> <b>it's</b> <b>OK</b>
       •   some spacing commands (\hspace, \pagebreak and \linebreak)

       •   \centering, \raggedleft, \raggedright

       •   \verb  and  verbatim environment. <b>tex2lyx</b> is careful to copy <u>exactly</u> in this case, including comments
           and whitespace.

       •   unknown (e.g., user-defined) environments and commands

       <b>tex2lyx</b> copies unknown commands, along with their arguments, verbatim into the LyX file. Also, if it sees
       a \begin{foo} where it doesn't recognize the “foo” environment, it  will  copy  verbatim  until  it  sees
       \end{foo}  (unless  you  use the <b>-r</b> option). Most of these unknown commands won't cause <b>tex2lyx</b> to break;
       they'll merely require you to do some editing once you've loaded the file up in LyX.  That should be less
       painful than editing either the .tex or the .lyx file using a text editor.

   <b>What</b> <b>tex2lyx</b> <b>Handles</b> <b>Badly</b> <b>---</b> <b>aka</b> <b>BUGS</b>
       Since <b>tex2lyx</b> is relatively new, it's got a number of problems.   As  it  matures,  these  bugs  will  be
       squished.

       •   “Exact”  copying  of  unknown environments and commands isn't quite exact.  This will yield ugly LyX,
           but in almost all cases the output will be the same.  However, most parts of the file will be  copied
           perfectly,   including   whitespace  and  comments.  This  includes:  the  LaTeX  preamble,  verbatim
           environments as well as \verb commands, and skip blocks.

       •   <b>tex2lyx</b> translates only a subset of the document class options to native features.  Other options are
           placed in the “options” field in the Document-&gt;Settings popup.

           More importantly, <b>tex2lyx</b> doesn't translate \newcommands,  unknown  \usepackage  commands  and  other
           unknown  code  in  the  preamble.  It  simply copies that into the LaTeX preamble. If you use special
           commands, e.g. to specify the text layout in a way that that is not understood by LyX, tex2lyx  won't
           recognize  it.  Note  that  these settings will be overwritten if you modify the text layout in LyX's
           document   settings.   Better   remove   these   special   options   from    the    LaTeX    preamble
           (Document-&gt;Settings-&gt;LaTeX Preamble) and use the corresponding LyX document settings, if possible.

       •   The  foil document class has a couple of bugs. <b>tex2lyx</b> may do weird things with optional arguments to
           \foilhead commands. Also, it may handle \begin{dinglist}  incorrectly  (although  the  stuff  in  the
           environment should translate normally).

       All known bugs of <b>tex2lyx</b> can be found on <u><a href="http://www.lyx.org/trac/wiki/BugTrackerHome">http://www.lyx.org/trac/wiki/BugTrackerHome</a></u>.

       <b>tex2lyx</b>  is  rather  robust. As mentioned above, it may not translate your file perfectly, but the result
       should be usable and it shouldn't crash. If you encounter problems---and the problem is not one of  those
       mentioned  above or on <u><a href="http://www.lyx.org/trac/wiki/BugTrackerHome">http://www.lyx.org/trac/wiki/BugTrackerHome</a></u>---please report the issue as described
       in the section on <u>Bug</u> <u>Reports</u>.

   <b>What</b> <b>LyX</b> <b>Can't</b> <b>Handle</b>
       LyX itself is missing a couple of features, such that even if <b>tex2lyx</b> translates  things  perfectly,  LyX
       may  still have trouble reading it. If you really need these features, you can export your final document
       as LaTeX, and put them back in. See <u>BUGS</u> for more details on these bugs.

       •   For a number of commands (such as \\), LyX does not support  the  optional  argument.   <b>tex2lyx</b>  will
           automatically  discard  the  optional arguments with a warning to stdout.  LyX also ignores the width
           argument for the thebibliography environment.

       •   LyX support for tables isn't perfect. For complicated tables, use a “skip” block, so that  they  will
           be copied in TeX mode.

       •   LyX  allows  figures to have sizes in the units known to TeX, such as in, cm, etc. It also translates
           percentages of \textwidth, \textheight, \columnwidth, but no other lengths (e.g.  if  you  wanted  to
           scale  a  figure  to  size \topmargin for some reason). <b>tex2lyx</b> will copy figures with untranslatable
           sizes in TeX mode. Again, you might be able to fix that within LyX.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       tex2lyx <b>-f</b> <b>-r</b> “myenv” foo.tex

       The above will create  a  file  foo.lyx  from  foo.tex,  overwriting  if  necessary.   When  it  finds  a
       \begin{myenv}  ...  \end{myenv}  block, it will translate the stuff within the block, but copy the \begin
       and \end commands in TeX mode.

       tex2lyx <b>-n</b> <b>-c</b> “literate-article” foo.tex

       The above will change a noweb document into a LyX literate-article document. A user would do this if  the
       noweb document had documentclass article.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Bug</b> <b>Reports</b>
       Bugs   should  be  reported  to  the  LyX  bug  tracker  at  <a href="http://www.lyx.org/trac/wiki/BugTrackerHome">http://www.lyx.org/trac/wiki/BugTrackerHome</a>.
       Additionally, you can post a message to the LyX developers' mailing list. Its address is  currently  lyx-
       <a href="mailto:devel@lists.lyx.org">devel@lists.lyx.org</a>.  If  your  message bounces, you can check the LyX home page, <a href="http://www.lyx.org/">http://www.lyx.org/</a>. If
       you are running <b>tex2lyx</b> on a huge file, please do not send all of the output in  your  bug  report.  Just
       include  the  last  ten  or twenty lines of output, along with the piece of the LaTeX file it crashed on.
       Or, even better, attach a small but complete file which causes the same problem as your original file.

   <b>Layout</b> <b>Files</b>
       <b>tex2lyx</b> reads a LyX layout file to  know  how  to  handle  LaTeX  environments  and  commands  which  get
       translated  to  LyX  layouts.  This file will include all “normal” non-math environments (i.e., including
       quote and itemize, but not tabular, minipage, and some  other  fancy  environments),  and  commands  like
       \section  and  \title.  If  you  want  to tex2lyx a class that doesn't have an existing layout file, then
       you'll have to create a layout file. But you have to do this anyway, in order to LyX the file, since  LyX
       depends  on  layout  files  to know how to display and process its files. Check the LyX documentation for
       help with this task (which can be hard or easy, depending on the class you want to create a  layout  file
       for.)  If  your  class  is  quite  similar  to a class that has a layout file, then consider using the <b>-c</b>
       option.

   <b>Syntax</b> <b>Files</b>
       <b>tex2lyx</b> always reads at least one syntax file, called the default syntax file.  <b>tex2lyx</b>  will  read  your
       personal  syntax  file  if  it  exists;  otherwise  it  will read the system-wide file. <b>tex2lyx</b> will read
       additional syntax files if you specify them with the <b>-s</b> option. (These extra files should have  the  same
       format  as  the default file, but will tend to be shorter, since they only have to specify extra commands
       not found in the default file.) A syntax file tells <b>tex2lyx</b> a few things.

       First, it describes the syntax of each command, that  is,  how  many  required  arguments  and  how  many
       optional  arguments  the  command  takes.  Knowing this makes it easier for <b>tex2lyx</b> to copy (in TeX mode)
       commands that it doesn't know how to translate. The syntax file simply has a command, followed by  braces
       or  brackets describing its arguments in the correct order. For example, a syntax file entry \bibitem[]{}
       means that the \bibitem command takes an optional argument followed by a required one,  while  the  entry
       \bf  means  that  the  \bf  command  takes  no arguments at all.  When <b>tex2lyx</b> encounters a token that it
       doesn't know how to translate into LyX, it will  copy  the  token---along  with  the  correct  number  of
       arguments---exactly.   If the token is not in the syntax file, then <b>tex2lyx</b> just copies as many arguments
       as it finds.  This means that it may copy too much. But since the  user  can  specify  additional  syntax
       files, that shouldn't happen often.

       Some  commands that cannot be translated to LyX, like \mbox, have as one of their arguments regular LaTeX
       text. If the string “translate” is put into an argument of an  (untranslatable)  command  in  the  syntax
       file,  then  <b>tex2lyx</b>  will  translate  that argument instead of copying it verbatim. So, for example, the
       default syntax file has \raisebox{}[][]{translate}. This means that the \raisebox command and  the  first
       argument  (and optional arguments if they exist) are copied in TeX mode, but the last argument (which may
       contain math, complicated LaTeX, other untranslatable commands, etc.) will be translated  into  LyX.  You
       can't use “translate” on optional arguments.

       User-defined  syntax files are allowed to define new commands and their syntax, or override the number of
       arguments for a command given in the default syntax file. (E.g., if you're using a style  that  gives  an
       extra  argument  to  some  command...) However, this will only be useful for commands copied in TeX mode.
       Commands which are actually translated by <b>tex2lyx</b> (like \item) have their argument syntax hard-coded. The
       hard-coded commands are identified in the default syntax file.

       Second, the syntax file describes any “regular environments”.  Usually,  an  entire  unknown  environment
       will  be copied in TeX mode. If you define a regular environment “foo”, though, then only the \begin{foo}
       and \end{foo} commands will be copied in TeX mode; the text within the environment will be treated (i.e.,
       translated) by <b>tex2lyx</b> as regular LaTeX, rather than being copied into TeX mode.  Don't  try  to  declare
       “tabbing”  and  “picture”  as  regular  environments,  as the text within those environments will confuse
       <b>tex2lyx</b>; use this capability for new environments you create that have  plain  text  or  math  or  simple
       commands  in  them.  You  also  can't  declare  unknown  math  environments  (like  equation*) as regular
       environments, either, since the LyX math editor won't understand them. The names of regular  environments
       appear,  whitespace-separated,  between  \begin{tex2lyxre}  and  \end{tex2lyxre} statements in the syntax
       file. (If you have a regular environment which you won't use very often, you can use the <b>-r</b> option rather
       than writing a syntax file.)

</pre><h4><b>WARNINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Always keep a copy of your original LaTeX  files  either  under  a  different  name  or  in  a  different
       directory. There are a couple ways in which using LyX could lead to overwriting the original LaTeX file.

       If  you  import  foo.tex to create foo.lyx, then edit foo.lyx and want to re-export it, note that it will
       overwrite the original foo.tex. (LyX will ask you if you want to overwrite it.)

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>LYX_DIR_24x</b>
             can be used to specify which system directory to use.

       The system directory is determined by searching for the file "chkconfig.ltx". Directories are searched in
       this order:
       1) -sysdir command line parameter
       2) LYX_DIR_24x environment variable
       3) Maybe &lt;path of binary&gt;/TOP_SRCDIR/lib
       4) &lt;path of binary&gt;/../share/&lt;name of binary&gt;/
       5) hardcoded lyx_dir (at build time: /usr/share/lyx)

       <b>LYX_USERDIR_24x</b>
              can be used to specify which user directory to use.

       The user directory is, in order of precedence:
       1) -userdir command line parameter
       2) LYX_USERDIR_24x environment variable
       3) $HOME/.&lt;name of binary&gt; if no explicit setting is made

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       If <u>LIBDIR</u> is the system-wide LyX directory and  <u>MY_LYXDIR</u>  is  your  personal  LyX  directory,  then  the
       following files are read by tex2lyx:

       <u>MY_LYXDIR</u>/layouts/*.layout
           User's personal layout files for document classes

       <u>MY_LYXDIR</u>/syntax.default
           User's personal syntax file

       <u>MY_LYXDIR</u>/encodings
           User's personal encoding definition file

       <u>LIBDIR</u>/layouts/*.layout
           System-wide layout files for document classes

       <u>LIBDIR</u>/lib/syntax.default
           System-wide LaTeX syntax file

       <u>LIBDIR</u>/lib/encodings
           System-wide encoding definition file
