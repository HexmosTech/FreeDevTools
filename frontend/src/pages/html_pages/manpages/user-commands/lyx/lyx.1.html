</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       LyX - A Document Processor

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lyx</b> [ <u>command-line</u> <u>switches</u> ] [ <u>name[.lyx]</u> <u>...</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>LyX</b>  is  too  complex  to  be  described  completely in the "man" page format. If your system is properly
       configured, you can access the full documentation within <b>LyX</b> under the Help menu.

       <b>LyX</b> is a document preparation system. It excels at letting you create complex  technical  and  scientific
       articles  with  mathematics, cross-references, bibliographies, indices, etc. It is very good at documents
       of any length in which the usual processing abilities are required: automatic sectioning and  pagination,
       spellchecking, and so forth. It can also be used to write a letter to your mom, though granted, there are
       probably  simpler  programs  available for that. It is definitely not the best tool for creating banners,
       flyers, or advertisements, though with some effort all these can be done, too.  Some examples of what  it
       is  used  for:  memos,  letters,  dissertations  and theses, lecture notes, seminar notebooks, conference
       proceedings, software documentation, books (on PostgreSQL, remote sensing, cryptology, fictional  novels,
       poetry,  and  even a children's book or two), articles in refereed scientific journals, scripts for plays
       and movies, business proposals... you get the idea.

       Currently, <b>LyX</b> uses the Qt library as a toolkit. <b>LyX</b> should run  everywhere,  where  this  library  runs.
       This is on all major Unix platforms as well as Windows and macOS (which actually is a unix platform).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>LyX</b> supports the following command-line switches.

       <b>-help</b> summarizes LyX usage

       <b>-version</b>
             provides version information on the build of LyX.

       <b>-sysdir</b> <u>directory</u>
             sets system directory. Normally not needed.

       <b>-userdir</b> <u>directory</u>
             sets user directory. Needed if you want to use LyX with different lyxrc settings.

       <b>-geometry</b> <u>WxH+X+Y</u>
             set geometry of the main window.

       <b>-dbg</b> <u>feature[,feature...]</u>
             where feature is a name or number.  Use "<b>lyx</b> <b>-dbg</b>" to see the list of available debug features.

        <b>-x</b> <b>[--execute]</b> <u>command</u>
             where command is a lyx command.

        <b>-e</b> <b>[--export]</b> <u>fmt</u>
             where  fmt  is  the  export format of choice (latex, pdflatex, luatex, xetex, xhtml, text, lyx, ps,
             pdf, ...).  Note that the order of -e and -x switches matters.

        <b>-E</b> <b>[--export-to]</b> <u>fmt</u> <u>filename</u>
             where fmt is the export format of choice (see --export), and filename is the destination  filename.
             Note that any additional external file needed by filename (such as image files) will be exported as
             well  to  the folder containing filename (preserving the relative path embedded within the original
             LyX document, if any).

        <b>-i</b> <b>[--import]</b> <u>fmt</u> <u>file.xxx</u>
             where fmt is the import format of choice and file.xxx is the file to be imported.

        <b>-f</b> <b>[--force-overwrite]</b> <u>what</u>
             where what is is either "<b>all</b>", "<b>main</b>" or "<b>none</b>".  Specify "<b>all</b>"  to  allow  overwriting  all  files
             during  a  batch  export,  "<b>main</b>"  to  allow  overwriting the main file only, or "<b>none</b>" to disallow
             overwriting any file. When this switch is followed by anything else other  than  "<b>all</b>",  "<b>main</b>"  or
             "<b>none</b>", the behavior is as if "<b>all</b>" was specified, but what follows is left on the command line for
             further processing.

        <b>--ignore-error-message</b> <u>which</u>
             allows  you  to  ignore  specific  LaTeX error messages.  Do not use for final documents! Currently
             supported values: "<b>missing_glyphs</b>" Fontspec "missing glyphs" error.

        <b>-n</b> <b>[--no-remote]</b>
             open documents passed as arguments in a new instance, even if another instance of  LyX  is  already
             running.

        <b>-r</b> <b>[--remote]</b>
             by  using  the  lyxpipe,  ask  an  already  running instance of LyX to open the documents passed as
             arguments and then exit. If the lyxpipe is not set up or is not working, a new instance is  created
             and execution continues normally.

        <b>-v</b> <b>[--verbose]</b>
             print on terminal all spawned external commands.

       <b>-batch</b>
             causes LyX to run the given commands without opening a GUI window.  Thus, something like:
                 lyx -batch -x "buffer-print printer default dvips" myfile.lyx
             will  cause  LyX  to  print  myfile.lyx  to  the default printer, using dvips and the default print
             settings (which, of course, have to have been configured already).

</pre><h4><b>QT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>LyX</b> is a Qt-based application and thus recognizes  common  options  implemented  by  Qt  itself  (notably
       <b>-platform</b>,  <b>-style</b>,  <b>-geometry</b>,  <b>-session</b>,  <b>-display</b>,  etc).  Please consult Qt documentation for further
       details, e.g.:

       https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qapplication.html#QApplication
       https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qguiapplication.html#supported-command-line-options

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>LYX_DIR_24x</b>
              can be used to specify which system directory to use.

       The system directory is determined by searching for the file "chkconfig.ltx". Directories are searched in
       this order:
       1) -sysdir command line parameter
       2) LYX_DIR_24x environment variable
       3) Maybe &lt;path of binary&gt;/TOP_SRCDIR/lib
       4) &lt;path of binary&gt;/../share/&lt;name of binary&gt;/
       5) hardcoded lyx_dir (at build time: /usr/share/lyx)

       <b>LYX_USERDIR_24x</b>
              can be used to specify which user directory to use.

       The user directory is, in order of precedence:
       1) -userdir command line parameter
       2) LYX_USERDIR_24x environment variable
       3) $HOME/.&lt;name of binary&gt; if no explicit setting is made

       <b>LYX_LOCALEDIR</b>
              can be used to tell LyX where to look for the translations of its GUI strings in other languages.

       <b>LYX_FORCE_OVERWRITE</b>
              can be used to change the default behavior when exporting from command line.

       By default, LyX overwrites the main file when exporting from command line but not  the  ancillary  files.
       This  behavior  can be changed by setting this environment variable, which relieves the need of using the
       -f switch.  Allowed values are either "<b>all</b>", "<b>main</b>" or "<b>none</b>", with same meaning as for the -f switch.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS/LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There are still some bugs in <b>LyX</b>. To report one, read if possible the Introduction found under  the  Help
       menu  in  LyX.  You'll  find  detailed  info  on submitting bug reports there. If you can't do that, send
       details to the LyX Developers mailing list  <a href="mailto:lyx-devel@lists.lyx.org">lyx-devel@lists.lyx.org</a>,  or  use  the  LyX  bug  tracker  at
       <a href="http://www.lyx.org/trac/wiki/BugTrackerHome">http://www.lyx.org/trac/wiki/BugTrackerHome</a>.   Don't  forget  to  mention  which  version  you are having
       problems with!

       <b>LaTeX</b> import is still not perfect and may produce buggy *.lyx files. Consult the <b>tex2lyx</b> documentation.
