</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PatMaN - search for approximate patterns in DNA libraries

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>patman</b> <b>[</b> <u>option</u> <b>|</b> <u>file</u> <b>...</b> <b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>PatMaN</b> searches for (small) <u>patterns</u> in (huge) DNA <u>databases</u>, allowing for some mismatches and optionally
       gaps.   <u>Patterns</u>  and  <u>databases</u> are read from one or more <b><a href="../man5/fasta.5.html">fasta</a></b>(5) files listed as non-option arguments,
       depending on whether the <u>-D</u> or <u>-P</u> option last preceded them, and matched against each other.  The  output
       of <b>PatMaN</b> is a table containing one line for each match, consisting of tab-separated fields:

       •   name of database sequence,

       •   name of pattern,

       •   position of first matched base in database sequence, the sequence's beginning has position 1,

       •   position of last matched base in database sequence,

       •   strand (+ for literal match, - for reverse complement),

       •   edit distance (number of mismatches plus number of gaps).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -V, --version
              Print version number and exit.

       -e num, --edits num
              Allow up to <u>num</u> mismatches and/or gaps per match.

       -g num, --gaps num
              Allow  up to <u>num</u> gaps per match.  Note that gaps count as mismatches, too, so the <u>-e</u> option should
              always be set at least as high as the <u>-g</u> option.  Allowing many  gaps  can  incur  a  considerable
              computational cost.

       -D, --databases
              Treat  the  following files as <u>database</u>.  Databases must be in <b><a href="../man5/fasta.5.html">fasta</a></b>(5) format.  Multiple <u>database</u>
              files, including "-" for standard input, are allowed and are read in turn.

       -P, --patterns
              Treat the following files as <u>patterns</u>.  Pattern  files  must  be  in  <b><a href="../man5/fasta.5.html">fasta</a></b>(5)  format.   Multiple
              <u>pattern</u>  files, including "-" for standard input, are allowed and are all read before touching the
              <u>databases.</u>

       -o file, --output file
              Redirect output to <u>file</u>.  The file name "-" causes output to be written to stdout, which  is  also
              the default

       -a, --ambicodes
              Activate  the interpretation of ambiguity codes in patterns.  This results in the expansion of any
              <u>pattern</u> with ambiguity codes into  multiple  patterns  which  can  match  independently.   Compare
              <b>Unknown</b> <b>Nucleotides</b> below.

       -s, --singlestrand
              Deactivate  matching  of  reverse-complements.   Normally,  <b>PatMaN</b> will try to match patterns both
              literally and after reverse-complementing them,  with  this  option  set,  only  straight  forward
              matches are considered.

       -p num, --prefetch num
              Causes  <u>num</u> pointers to be prefetched in advance.  This feature can improve performance, if <b>PatMaN</b>
              has been compiled for a processor architecture that supports prefetching.  The optimum  value  for
              your particular setup has to be determined empirically, but the default should be reasonably good.

       -l len, --min-length len
              Only  consider  patterns  with  a  length  of  at  least <u>len</u>.  Use this if your <u>pattern</u> collection
              contains short sequences that you don't want lots of possible matches reported for.

       -x num, --chop3 num
              Cut off <u>num</u> bases from the 3' end of each <u>pattern.</u>  Use this for <u>patterns</u>  with  damaged,  edited,
              etc.  3'  ends  that should be ignored.  The chopped bases are neither matched nor included in the
              reported match regions.

       -X num, --chop5 num
              Cut off <u>num</u> bases from the 5' end of each <u>pattern.</u>  Use this for <u>patterns</u>  with  damaged,  edited,
              etc.  5'  ends  that should be ignored.  The chopped bases are neither matched nor included in the
              reported match regions.

       -A, --adenine-hack
              Allow adenine to be ignored in patterns.  This is essentially equivalent to not counting  gaps  in
              the  <u>database,</u>  as long as it was an A that was gapped.  Using <u>-A</u> can be computationally extremely
              expensive, both in terms of memory and time consumed.

       -q, --quiet
              Suppress warnings (about unrecognized characters in input sequences or missing input files).  Even
              without <u>-q</u>, at most one such warning is given per run.

       -v, --verbose
              Prints additional progress information to stderr.

       -d flags, --debug flags
              Sets debugging flags to <u>flags</u>.<u>Flags</u> may be the logical <u>OR</u> of any of the following values, each  of
              which causes some output to appear on <u>stderr</u>.  Some of the values may only work if <b>PatMaN</b> has been
              compiled in debug mode.  The default value is 1.

       1      Print warnings.  Equivalent to not setting <u>-q</u>.

       2      Print progress information.  Equivalent to setting <u>-v</u>.

       4      Dump the suffix trie of the <u>patterns</u>.  Only available in debug build.

       8      Count  number  of  visited nodes and print that number in each iteration.  Only available in debug
              build.

       16     Print total number of nodes fetched from memory after completing all <u>databases</u>.

       32     Output <u>database</u> sequence while it is being matched.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Non-Option</b> <b>Arguments</b>
       Non-option arguments (bare filenames) are either treated as  <u>database</u>  or  <u>pattern</u>  files,  depending  on
       whether the <u>-D</u> or <u>-P</u> option was the the last that occurred before the filename.  If neither <u>-D</u> nor <u>-P</u> was
       given,  file  names  are  treated  as  <u>pattern</u>  files.  If no <u>database</u> was given, it is instead read from
       standard input.  Standard input can be explicitly given as either a <u>database</u> or a <u>pattern</u> file  by  using
       the  filename  "-".   A  warning  is given if standard input is selected implicitly as <u>database,</u> an error
       message is given if no <u>pattern</u> files have been named at all.

   <b>Gapped</b> <b>Matching</b>
       Allowing gaps often causes overlapping matches of single <u>patterns</u> at almost the  same  position.   <b>PatMaN</b>
       makes  no  attempt  to filter these redundant matches.  Also note that allowing many gaps, and especially
       allowing an arbitrary amount of gaps through the <u>-A</u> hack can slow down <b>PatMaN</b> considerably and  cause  it
       to produce enormous amounts of output.  The use of some sorty of post-processor to filter these is highly
       recommended.

   <b>Unknown</b> <b>Nucleotides</b>
       Unknown  nucleotides  are most often encoded by the letter <b>N</b>.  If the <u>--ambicodes</u> option is not given, Ns
       in patterns are interpreted as unknown nucleotides and can never match without penalty.   If  <u>--ambicodes</u>
       is  given,  Ns  in  <u>patterns</u>  are  expanded just like the other amibuguity codes, and effectively work as
       wildcards.  Unknown nucleotides can still be encoded by an <b>X</b> and will never match anything.  The database
       is treated differently in that anything other than <u>A</u>, <u>C</u>, <u>G</u>,  <u>T</u>  and  <u>U</u>,  including  ambiguity  codes,  is
       treated as unknown and can never match without penalty.
