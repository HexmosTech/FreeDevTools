</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pt-fifo-split - Split files and pipe lines to a fifo without really splitting.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: pt-fifo-split [OPTIONS] [FILE]

       pt-fifo-split splits FILE and pipes lines to a fifo.  With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard
       input.

       Read hugefile.txt in chunks of a million lines without physically splitting it:

        pt-fifo-split --lines 1000000 hugefile.txt
        while [ -e /tmp/pt-fifo-split ]; do cat /tmp/pt-fifo-split; done

</pre><h4><b>RISKS</b></h4><pre>
       Percona Toolkit is mature, proven in the real world, and well tested, but all database tools can pose a
       risk to the system and the database server.  Before using this tool, please:

       •   Read the tool's documentation

       •   Review the tool's known "BUGS"

       •   Test the tool on a non-production server

       •   Backup your production server and verify the backups

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       pt-fifo-split  lets  you read from a file as though it contains only some of the lines in the file.  When
       you read from it again, it contains the next set of lines; when you have gone all the way through it, the
       file disappears.  This works only on Unix-like operating systems.

       You can specify multiple files on the command line.  If you don't specify any, or if you use the  special
       filename "-", lines are read from standard input.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This  tool  accepts additional command-line arguments.  Refer to the "SYNOPSIS" and usage information for
       details.

       --config
           type: Array

           Read this comma-separated list of config files; if specified, this must be the first  option  on  the
           command line.

       --fifo
           type: string; default: /tmp/pt-fifo-split

           The name of the fifo from which the lines can be read.

       --force
           Remove the fifo if it exists already, then create it again.

       --help
           Show help and exit.

       --lines
           type: int; default: 1000

           The number of lines to read in each chunk.

       --offset
           type: int; default: 0

           Begin  at  the  Nth  line.   If  the  argument  is  0, all lines are printed to the fifo.  If 1, then
           beginning at the first line, lines are printed (exactly the same as 0).  If  2,  the  first  line  is
           skipped, and the 2nd and subsequent lines are printed to the fifo.

       --pid
           type: string

           Create  the  given  PID  file.   The  tool  won't start if the PID file already exists and the PID it
           contains is different than the current PID.  However, if the PID file exists and the PID it  contains
           is  no  longer  running,  the tool will overwrite the PID file with the current PID.  The PID file is
           removed automatically when the tool exits.

       --statistics
           Print out statistics between chunks.  The statistics are the number of chunks, the number  of  lines,
           elapsed time, and lines per second overall and during the last chunk.

       --version
           Show version and exit.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The  environment  variable "PTDEBUG" enables verbose debugging output to STDERR.  To enable debugging and
       capture all output to a file, run the tool like:

          PTDEBUG=1 pt-fifo-split ... &gt; FILE 2&gt;&amp;1

       Be careful: debugging output is voluminous and can generate several megabytes of output.

</pre><h4><b>SYSTEM</b> <b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       You need Perl, DBI, DBD::mysql, and some core packages that ought to be installed in any  reasonably  new
       version of Perl.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       For a list of known bugs, see &lt;<a href="http://www.percona.com/bugs/pt-fifo-split">http://www.percona.com/bugs/pt-fifo-split</a>&gt;.

       Please  report bugs at &lt;https://jira.percona.com/projects/PT&gt;.  Include the following information in your
       bug report:

       •   Complete command-line used to run the tool

       •   Tool "--version"

       •   MySQL version of all servers involved

       •   Output from the tool including STDERR

       •   Input files (log/dump/config files, etc.)

       If possible, include debugging output by running the tool with "PTDEBUG"; see "ENVIRONMENT".
