</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       libinput-debug-gui - visual debug helper for libinput

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>libinput</b> <b>debug-gui</b> <u>[options]</u>

       <b>libinput</b> <b>debug-gui</b> <u>[options]</u> <b>--udev</b> <u>&lt;seat&gt;</u>

       <b>libinput</b> <b>debug-gui</b> <u>[options]</u> <b>[--device]</b> <u>/dev/input/event0</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>libinput</b>  <b>debug-gui</b> tool creates a libinput context and a full-screen GTK window to visualize events
       processed by libinput. This tool exclusively grabs pointing devices and stops them from interacting  with
       the rest of the GUI.

       <b>Hit</b> <b>Esc</b> <b>to</b> <b>exit</b> <b>this</b> <b>tool.</b>

       This  is  a debugging tool only, its output or behavior may change at any time. Do not rely on the output
       or the behavior.

       This tool usually needs to be run as root to have access to the /dev/input/eventX nodes.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--device</b> <u>/dev/input/event0</u>
               Use the given device with the path backend. The <b>--device</b> argument may be omitted.

       <b>--grab</b>  Exclusively grab all opened devices. This will prevent events from being delivered  to  the  host
               system.

       <b>--help</b>  Print help

       <b>--udev</b> <u>&lt;seat&gt;</u>
               Use  the udev backend to listen for device notifications on the given seat.  The default behavior
               is equivalent to --udev "seat0".

       <b>--verbose</b>
               Use verbose output

       For libinput configuration options, see <a href="../man1/libinput-debug-events.1.html">libinput-debug-events</a>(1)

</pre><h4><b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Cursor</b> <b>movement</b>
               The cursor is displayed as black triangle. Various markers are displayed in light  grey  to  help
               debug cusor positioning. The cursor movement is the one as seen by libinput and may not match the
               cursor movement of the display server.

       The  unaccelerated cusor motion is displayed as a grey upside-down triangle.  The movement of this cursor
       typically reflects the relative motion in device units and can differ significantly to the normal  cursor
       movement.

       The  unaccelerated cursor motion is also displayed as a yellow snake. This is the connected set of recent
       deltas. Unlike the unaccelerated cursor, these coordinates are not clipped to the window.

       <b>Button</b> <b>testing</b>
               Four oblongs are displayed at the bottom. The top three are left, middle, right, the  bottom  one
               is for any other button and displays the button name on press.

       <b>Scrolling</b>
               The  green  oblongs  show  the  scrolling in continuous space, the smaller red oblongs the scroll
               steps in discrete steps.

       <b>Gestures</b>
               A set of four horizontal black rings show swipe gestures, with the  number  of  detected  fingers
               filled in. A set of two black rings show pinch gestures, filled when events are detected.

       <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>events</b>
               Touch and absolute mouse events are displayed as red and blue circles, respectively, at the touch
               point or absolute position.

       <b>Tablet</b> <b>tools</b>
               Events  from tablet tools show a cyan square at the proximity-in and proximity-out positions. The
               tool position is shown as circle and increases in radius with increasing  pressure  or  distance.
               Pressure  and  distance  are  also  shown in the vertical bar south-east of center. Where tilt is
               available, the circle changes to an ellipsis to indicate the tilt angle.   Relative  events  from
               the tablet tool are displayed as a yellow snake, always starting from the center of the window on
               proximity  in. Button events are displayed in the bottom-most button oblong, with the name of the
               button displayed on press.

       <b>Tablet</b> <b>pads</b>
               Button events are displayed in the bottom-most  button  oblong,  with  the  name  of  the  button
               displayed  on  press.  Dials, ring and strip events are displayed in the yellow 'IO' symbol, with
               the position of the ring or strip or the delta of the dial filled in when events  are  available.
               The number of the dial, ring or strip is displayed when an event is available.

       <b>Kernel</b> <b>events</b>
               Left of the center is a blue ring to debug kernel relative events (REL_X and REL_Y). Each unit is
               displayed  as  one  arrow  in  the  respective  direction.   Right of the center is a blue oblong
               representing the most recently-used touch device. Touch events are displayed  as  they  are  read
               from the kernel.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Events  shown  by  this  tool may not correspond to the events seen by a different user of libinput. This
       tool initializes a separate context.
