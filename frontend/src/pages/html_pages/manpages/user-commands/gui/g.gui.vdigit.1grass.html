</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>vector</b>  <b>digitizer</b>  is  a <u>wxGUI</u> component intended for interactive editing and digitizing vector maps
       (see <u>v.edit</u> for non-interactive vector editing GRASS capabilities).

       Note that only vector maps stored or generated in the <u>current</u> mapset can be opened for editing.

       The digitizer allows editing of 2D vector features (points, lines, centroids, boundaries, and areas).

       Vector features can be selected by mouse (bounding box or simply by mouse click, see select threshold  in
       <u>Settings→General→Select</u> <u>threshold</u>), or by query (eg. by line length, see <u>Settings→Query</u> <u>Tool</u>).

   <b>STARTING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>DIGITIZER</b>
       The  vector  digitizer  can  be  launched  from  Map  Display  toolbar by selecting "Digitize" from <u>Tools</u>
       combobox. Vector map is selectable for editing from Digitizer toolbar ("Select vector map" combobox, note
       that only vector maps from the current layer tree in Layer Manager are listed).  The vector digitizer can
       alternatively be activated from the contextual menu in the Layer Manager by selecting "Start editing"  on
       selected vector map in the layer tree, or directly from the Layer Manager toolbar .  The vector digitizer
       also can also be launched from the command line as a stand-alone application <u>g.gui.vdigit</u>.

   <b>CREATING</b> <b>A</b> <b>NEW</b> <b>VECTOR</b> <b>MAP</b>
       A  new  vector  map  can  be  easily  created from the digitizer toolbar by selecting "New vector map" in
       "Select vector map" combobox. A new vector map is created, added to  the  current  layer  tree  in  Layer
       Manager  and opened for editing. "Select vector map" combobox in the digitizer toolbar also allows easily
       switching between vector maps to be edited.

   <b>EDITING</b> <b>AN</b> <b>EXISTING</b> <b>VECTOR</b> <b>MAP</b>
       An existing vector map selected in the digitizer toolbar in the "Select vector map" combobox. This map is
       then opened for editing and added to the current layer tree in the <u>Layer</u>  <u>Manager</u>.  This  "Select  vector
       map" combobox in the digitizer toolbar also allows to easily switch between vector maps to be edited.

   <b>USING</b> <b>A</b> <b>RASTER</b> <b>BACKGROUND</b> <b>MAP</b>
       In order to digitize from a raster map, simply load the map into the <u>Map</u> <u>Display</u> using the <u>Layer</u> <u>Manager</u>.
       Then start digitizing, see below for details.

   <b>USING</b> <b>A</b> <b>VECTOR</b> <b>BACKGROUND</b> <b>MAP</b>
       The  vector digitizer allows you to select a "background" vector map.  Loading it within the digitizer is
       different from simply loading it via <u>Layer</u> <u>Manager</u> since direct interaction with single  vector  features
       then becomes possible.
       Vector  features  may  be  copied from the background map by "Copy features from (background) vector map"
       tool from the "Additional tools" of the digitizer toolbar.  Newly digitized vector features  are  snapped
       in the given threshold to the features from the background map.

   <b>DIGITIZER</b> <b>TOOLBAR</b>
             <u>Digitize</u> <u>new</u> <u>point</u>
           Add new point to vector map and optionally define its attributes (Ctrl+P).

             <u>Digitize</u> <u>new</u> <u>line</u>
           Add new line to vector map and optionally define its attributes (Ctrl+L).

             <u>Digitize</u> <u>new</u> <u>boundary</u>
           Add new boundary to vector map and optionally define its attributes (Ctrl+B).

             <u>Digitize</u> <u>new</u> <u>centroid</u>
           Add new centroid to vector map and optionally define its attributes (Ctrl+C).

             <u>Digitize</u> <u>new</u> <u>area</u>
           Add  new  area  (closed  boundary  and  one  centroid inside) to vector map and optionally define its
           attributes (Ctrl+A).

             <u>Move</u> <u>vertex</u>
           Move selected vertex of linear feature. Thus shape of linear feature is changed (Ctrl+G).

             <u>Add</u> <u>vertex</u>
           Add new vertex to selected linear feature (shape not changed) (Ctrl+V).

             <u>Remove</u> <u>vertex</u>
           Remove selected vertex from linear feature (Ctrl+X). Thus shape of selected feature can be changed.

             <u>Edit</u> <u>line/boundary</u>
           Edit selected linear feature, add  new  segments  or  remove  existing  segments  of  linear  feature
           (Ctrl+E).

             <u>Move</u> <u>feature(s)</u>
           Move selected vector features (Ctrl+M.) Selection can be done by mouse or by query.

             <u>Delete</u> <u>feature(s)</u>
           Delete  selected vector features (point, line, centroid, or boundary) (Ctrl+D). Selection can be done
           by mouse or by query.

             <u>Delete</u> <u>areas(s)</u>
           Delete selected vector areas (Ctrl+F). Selection can be done by mouse or by query.

             <u>Display/update</u> <u>categories</u>
           Display categories of selected vector feature  (Ctrl+J).  Category  settings  can  be  modified,  new
           layer/category pairs added or already defined pairs removed.

             <u>Display/update</u> <u>attributes</u>
           Display  attributes  of selected vector feature (based on its category settings) (Ctrl+K). Attributes
           can be also modified. Same functionality is accessible from Main toolbar "Query vector map  (editable
           mode)".

             <u>Additional</u> <u>tools</u>

           •   <u>Break</u> <u>selected</u> <u>lines/boundaries</u> <u>at</u> <u>intersection</u>
               Split  given  vector  line  or  boundary  into  two  lines  on  given position (based on <u>v.clean</u>,
               tool=break).

           •   <u>Connect</u> <u>two</u> <u>selected</u> <u>lines/boundaries</u>
               Connect selected lines or boundaries, the first given line is connected to the  second  one.  The
               second  line  is  broken  if  necessary  on  each  intersection.  The lines are connected only if
               distance between them is not greater than snapping threshold value.

           •   <u>Copy</u> <u>categories</u>
               Copy category settings of selected vector feature to other vector features. Layer/category  pairs
               of  source  vector  features  are  appended  to  the  target  feature category settings. Existing
               layer/category pairs are not removed from category settings of the target features.

           •   <u>Copy</u> <u>features</u> <u>from</u> <u>(background)</u> <u>vector</u> <u>map</u>
               Make identical copy of selected vector features. If a background vector  map  has  been  selected
               from the Layer Manager, copy features from background vector map, not from the currently modified
               vector map.

           •   <u>Copy</u> <u>attributes</u>
               Duplicate  attributes  settings  of  selected  vector  feature  to  other  vector  features.  New
               category(ies) is appended to the target feature category settings and attributes duplicated based
               on category settings of source vector features. Existing layer/category  pairs  are  not  removed
               from category settings of the target features.

           •   <u>Feature</u> <u>type</u> <u>conversion</u>
               Change  feature  type of selected geometry features. Points are converted to centroids, centroids
               to points, lines to boundaries and boundaries to lines.

           •   <u>Flip</u> <u>selected</u> <u>lines/boundaries</u>
               Flip direction of selected linear features (lines or boundaries).

           •   <u>Merge</u> <u>selected</u> <u>lines/boundaries</u>
               Merge (at least two) selected vector lines or boundaries. The geometry of the merged vector lines
               can be changed. If the second line from two selected lines is in opposite direction to the first,
               it will be flipped. See also module <u>v.build.polylines</u>.

           •   <u>Snap</u> <u>selected</u> <u>lines/boundaries</u> <u>(only</u> <u>to</u> <u>nodes)</u>
               Snap vector features in given threshold. See also module <u>v.clean</u>. Note that  this  tool  supports
               only  snapping  to nodes. Snapping to vector features from background vector map is not currently
               supported.

           •   <u>Split</u> <u>line/boundary</u>
               Split selected line or boundary on given position.

           •   <u>Query</u> <u>tool</u>
               Select vector features by defining a threshold for  min/max  length  value  (linear  features  or
               dangles).

           •   <u>Z-bulk</u> <u>labeling</u> <u>of</u> <u>3D</u> <u>lines</u>
               Assign  z  coordinate  values  to  3D  vector  lines in bounding box. This is useful for labeling
               contour lines.

             <u>Undo</u>
           Undo previous operations (Ctrl+Z).

             <u>Redo</u>
           Redo previous operations (Ctrl+Y).

             <u>Settings</u>
           Digitizer settings (Ctrl+T).

             <u>Show</u> <u>help</u>
           Show help page for the Digitizer (Ctrl+H).

             <u>Quit</u> <u>digitizing</u> <u>tool</u>
           Changes in vector map can be optionally discarded when digitizing session is quited (Ctrl+Q).

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Mouse</b> <b>button</b> <b>functions:</b>

       <u>Left</u>   - select or deselect features

       <u>Control+Left</u> - cancel action or undo vertex when digitizing lines

       <u>Right</u>  - confirm action

       <u>Dead</u> <u>(deleted)</u> features are only marked as ’dead’ in the geometry file but remain there and occupy space.
       Any vector module used afterwards on this vector map which really reads and writes  vector  geometry  (so
       not <u>g.copy</u>) will write only features which are ’alive’.

       <u>Added</u> <u>or</u> <u>modified</u> vector features are <u>snapped</u> to existing vector features (Settings→General→Snapping). To
       disable snapping set the snapping threshold to ’0’.

       If  the  digitizer  crashes  for some reason, the changes are automatically saved. Broken topology can be
       repaired by running <u>v.build</u>.

       GRASS GIS uses a topological vector format, meaning that a common boundary of two polygons is only stored
       once. When digitizing polygons it is thus important to be able to only  draw  each  boundary  once.  When
       drawing  a  polygon  adjacent to an existing polygon, one has to first split the existing boundary at the
       points where the new boundary will be attached. Snapping should be set to ensure that the new  boundaries
       are automatically attached to the chosen points.
