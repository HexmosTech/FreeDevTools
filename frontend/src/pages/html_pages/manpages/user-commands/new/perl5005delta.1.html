</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl5005delta - what's new for perl5.005

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.004 release and this one.

</pre><h4><b>About</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>versioning</b> <b>system</b></h4><pre>
       Perl is now developed on two tracks: a maintenance track that makes small, safe updates to released
       production versions with emphasis on compatibility; and a development track that pursues more aggressive
       evolution.  Maintenance releases (which should be considered production quality) have subversion numbers
       that run from 1 to 49, and development releases (which should be considered "alpha" quality) run from 50
       to 99.

       Perl 5.005 is the combined product of the new dual-track development scheme.

</pre><h4><b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
   <b>WARNING:</b>  <b>This</b> <b>version</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>binary</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>with</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>5.004</b>
       Starting with Perl 5.004_50 there were many deep and far-reaching changes to the language internals.  If
       you have dynamically loaded extensions that you built under perl 5.003 or 5.004, you can continue to use
       them with 5.004, but you will need to rebuild and reinstall those extensions to use them 5.005.  See
       <u>INSTALL</u> for detailed instructions on how to upgrade.

   <b>Default</b> <b>installation</b> <b>structure</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed</b>
       The new Configure defaults are designed to allow a smooth upgrade from 5.004 to 5.005, but you should
       read <u>INSTALL</u> for a detailed discussion of the changes in order to adapt them to your system.

   <b>Perl</b> <b>Source</b> <b>Compatibility</b>
       When none of the experimental features are enabled, there should be very few user-visible Perl source
       compatibility issues.

       If threads are enabled, then some caveats apply. @_ and $_ become lexical variables.  The effect of this
       should be largely transparent to the user, but there are some boundary conditions under which user will
       need to be aware of the issues.  For example, local(@_) results in a "Can't localize lexical variable @_
       ..." message.  This may be enabled in a future version.

       Some new keywords have been introduced.  These are generally expected to have very little impact on
       compatibility.  See "New "INIT" keyword", "New "lock" keyword", and "New "qr//" operator".

       Certain barewords are now reserved.  Use of these will provoke a warning if you have asked for them with
       the "-w" switch.  See ""our" is now a reserved word".

   <b>C</b> <b>Source</b> <b>Compatibility</b>
       There have been a large number of changes in the internals to support the new features in this release.

       •   Core sources now require ANSI C compiler

           An ANSI C compiler is now <b>required</b> to build perl.  See <u>INSTALL</u>.

       •   All Perl global variables must now be referenced with an explicit prefix

           All  Perl  global  variables  that  are  visible  for use by extensions now have a "PL_" prefix.  New
           extensions should "not" refer to perl globals by their unqualified names.   To  preserve  sanity,  we
           provide  limited  backward  compatibility  for globals that are being widely used like "sv_undef" and
           "na" (which should now be written as "PL_sv_undef", "PL_na" etc.)

           If you find that your XS extension does not compile anymore because a perl global is not visible, try
           adding a "PL_" prefix to the global and rebuild.

           It is strongly recommended that all functions in the  Perl  API  that  don't  begin  with  "perl"  be
           referenced  with  a "Perl_" prefix.  The bare function names without the "Perl_" prefix are supported
           with macros, but this support may cease in a future release.

           See perlapi.

       •   Enabling threads has source compatibility issues

           Perl built with threading enabled requires extensions to use the new "dTHR" macro to  initialize  the
           handle  to  access  per-thread data.  If you see a compiler error that talks about the variable "thr"
           not being declared (when building a module that has XS  code),   you  need  to  add  "dTHR;"  at  the
           beginning of the block that elicited the error.

           The  API function "perl_get_sv("@",GV_ADD)" should be used instead of directly accessing perl globals
           as GvSV(errgv).  The API call  is  backward  compatible  with  existing  perls  and  provides  source
           compatibility with threading is enabled.

           See "C Source Compatibility" for more information.

   <b>Binary</b> <b>Compatibility</b>
       This  version  is  NOT binary compatible with older versions.  All extensions will need to be recompiled.
       Further binaries built with threads enabled are incompatible with binaries built  without.   This  should
       largely  be  transparent  to  the  user,  as all binary incompatible configurations have their own unique
       architecture name, and extension binaries get installed at unique locations.  This allows coexistence  of
       several configurations in the same directory hierarchy.  See <u>INSTALL</u>.

   <b>Security</b> <b>fixes</b> <b>may</b> <b>affect</b> <b>compatibility</b>
       A  few  taint  leaks and taint omissions have been corrected.  This may lead to "failure" of scripts that
       used to work with older versions.  Compiling  with  -DINCOMPLETE_TAINTS  provides  a  perl  with  minimal
       amounts  of  changes  to  the  tainting  behavior.   But  note  that  the  resulting perl will have known
       insecurities.

       Oneliners with the "-e" switch do not create temporary files anymore.

   <b>Relaxed</b> <b>new</b> <b>mandatory</b> <b>warnings</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>in</b> <b>5.004</b>
       Many new warnings that were introduced in 5.004 have been made optional.   Some  of  these  warnings  are
       still present, but perl's new features make them less often a problem.  See "New Diagnostics".

   <b>Licensing</b>
       Perl has a new Social Contract for contributors.  See <u>Porting/Contract</u>.

       The  license  included in much of the Perl documentation has changed.  Most of the Perl documentation was
       previously under the implicit GNU General Public License or the Artistic License (at the user's  choice).
       Now  much  of  the documentation unambiguously states the terms under which it may be distributed.  Those
       terms are in general much less restrictive than the GNU GPL.  See perl and the individual  perl  manpages
       listed therein.

</pre><h4><b>Core</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Threads</b>
       WARNING:  Threading  is  considered  an  <b>experimental</b>  feature.  Details of the implementation may change
       without notice.  There are known limitations and some bugs.  These are expected to  be  fixed  in  future
       versions.

       See <u>README.threads</u>.

   <b>Compiler</b>
       WARNING: The Compiler and related tools are considered <b>experimental</b>.  Features may change without notice,
       and  there  are  known  limitations  and bugs.  Since the compiler is fully external to perl, the default
       configuration will build and install it.

       The Compiler produces three different types  of  transformations  of  a  perl  program.   The  C  backend
       generates C code that captures perl's state just before execution begins.  It eliminates the compile-time
       overheads  of  the regular perl interpreter, but the run-time performance remains comparatively the same.
       The CC backend generates optimized C code equivalent to the code path at run-time.  The  CC  backend  has
       greater  potential  for  big  optimizations, but only a few optimizations are implemented currently.  The
       Bytecode backend generates a platform independent bytecode representation of the interpreter's state just
       before execution.  Thus, the Bytecode back end also eliminates much of the compilation  overhead  of  the
       interpreter.

       The compiler comes with several valuable utilities.

       "B::Lint"  is  an experimental module to detect and warn about suspicious code, especially the cases that
       the "-w" switch does not detect.

       "B::Deparse" can be used to demystify perl code, and understand how perl optimizes certain constructs.

       "B::Xref" generates cross reference reports of all definition  and  use  of  variables,  subroutines  and
       formats in a program.

       "B::Showlex" show the lexical variables used by a subroutine or file at a glance.

       "perlcc" is a simple frontend for compiling perl.

       See "ext/B/README", B, and the respective compiler modules.

   <b>Regular</b> <b>Expressions</b>
       Perl's  regular  expression  engine has been seriously overhauled, and many new constructs are supported.
       Several bugs have been fixed.

       Here is an itemized summary:

       Many new and improved optimizations
           Changes in the RE engine:

                   Unneeded nodes removed;
                   Substrings merged together;
                   New types of nodes to process (SUBEXPR)* and similar expressions
                       quickly, used if the SUBEXPR has no side effects and matches
                       strings of the same length;
                   Better optimizations by lookup for constant substrings;
                   Better search for constants substrings anchored by $ ;

           Changes in Perl code using RE engine:

                   More optimizations to s/longer/short/;
                   study() was not working;
                   /blah/ may be optimized to an analogue of index() if $&amp; $` $' not seen;
                   Unneeded copying of matched-against string removed;
                   Only matched part of the string is copying if $` $' were not seen;

       Many bug fixes
           Note that only the major bug fixes are listed here.  See <u>Changes</u> for others.

                   Backtracking might not restore start of $3.
                   No feedback if max count for * or + on "complex" subexpression
                       was reached, similarly (but at compile time) for {3,34567}
                   Primitive restrictions on max count introduced to decrease a
                       possibility of a segfault;
                   (ZERO-LENGTH)* could segfault;
                   (ZERO-LENGTH)* was prohibited;
                   Long REs were not allowed;
                   /RE/g could skip matches at the same position after a
                     zero-length match;

       New regular expression constructs
           The following new syntax elements are supported:

                   (?&lt;=RE)
                   (?&lt;!RE)
                   (?{ CODE })
                   (?i-x)
                   (?i:RE)
                   (?(COND)YES_RE|NO_RE)
                   (?&gt;RE)
                   \z

       New operator for precompiled regular expressions
           See "New "qr//" operator".

       Other improvements
                   Better debugging output (possibly with colors),
                       even from non-debugging Perl;
                   RE engine code now looks like C, not like assembler;
                   Behaviour of RE modifiable by `use re' directive;
                   Improved documentation;
                   Test suite significantly extended;
                   Syntax [:^upper:] etc., reserved inside character classes;

       Incompatible changes
                   (?i) localized inside enclosing group;
                   $( is not interpolated into RE any more;
                   /RE/g may match at the same position (with non-zero length)
                       after a zero-length match (bug fix).

       See perlre and perlop.

   <b>Improved</b> <b>malloc()</b>
       See banner at the beginning of "malloc.c" for details.

   <b>Quicksort</b> <b>is</b> <b>internally</b> <b>implemented</b>
       Perl now contains its own highly optimized <b>qsort()</b> routine.  The new <b>qsort()</b> is resistant to inconsistent
       comparison functions, so Perl's sort() will not provoke coredumps any more when given poorly written sort
       subroutines.  (Some C library qsort()s that were being used before used to have this  problem.)   In  our
       testing,  the  new  qsort() required the minimal number of pair-wise compares on average, among all known
       qsort() implementations.

       See "perlfunc/sort".

   <b>Reliable</b> <b>signals</b>
       Perl's signal handling is susceptible to random crashes, because signals arrive asynchronously,  and  the
       Perl runtime is not reentrant at arbitrary times.

       However,  one experimental implementation of reliable signals is available when threads are enabled.  See
       "Thread::Signal".  Also see <u>INSTALL</u> for how to build a Perl capable of threads.

   <b>Reliable</b> <b>stack</b> <b>pointers</b>
       The internals now reallocate the perl stack only at predictable times.  In particular, magic calls  never
       trigger  reallocations  of  the stack, because all reentrancy of the runtime is handled using a "stack of
       stacks".  This should improve reliability of cached stack pointers in the internals and in XSUBs.

   <b>More</b> <b>generous</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>returns</b>
       Perl used to complain if it encountered literal carriage returns in scripts.  Now they are mostly treated
       like whitespace within program text.  Inside string literals and here documents, literal carriage returns
       are ignored if they occur paired with linefeeds, or get interpreted as whitespace if  they  stand  alone.
       This  behavior  means  that  literal carriage returns in files should be avoided.  You can get the older,
       more compatible (but less generous) behavior by defining the preprocessor  symbol  "PERL_STRICT_CR"  when
       building  perl.   Of  course,  all this has nothing whatever to do with how escapes like "\r" are handled
       within strings.

       Note that this doesn't somehow magically allow you to keep all text files in DOS  format.   The  generous
       treatment  only  applies  to  files  that  perl itself parses.  If your C compiler doesn't allow carriage
       returns in files, you may still be unable to build modules that need a C compiler.

   <b>Memory</b> <b>leaks</b>
       "substr", "pos" and "vec" don't leak memory anymore when used in lvalue context.  Many small  leaks  that
       impacted applications that embed multiple interpreters have been fixed.

   <b>Better</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>interpreters</b>
       The  build-time  option  "-DMULTIPLICITY"  has  had many of the details reworked.  Some previously global
       variables that should have been per-interpreter now are.  With care, this  allows  interpreters  to  call
       each other.  See the "PerlInterp" extension on CPAN.

   <b>Behavior</b> <b>of</b> <b>local()</b> <b>on</b> <b>array</b> <b>and</b> <b>hash</b> <b>elements</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>well-defined</b>
       See "Temporary Values via <b>local()</b>" in perlsub.

   <b>"%!"</b> <b>is</b> <b>transparently</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Errno</b> <b>module</b>
       See perlvar, and Errno.

   <b>Pseudo-hashes</b> <b>are</b> <b>supported</b>
       See perlref.

   <b>"EXPR</b> <b>foreach</b> <b>EXPR"</b> <b>is</b> <b>supported</b>
       See perlsyn.

   <b>Keywords</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>globally</b> <b>overridden</b>
       See perlsub.

   <b>$^E</b> <b>is</b> <b>meaningful</b> <b>on</b> <b>Win32</b>
       See perlvar.

   <b>"foreach</b> <b>(1..1000000)"</b> <b>optimized</b>
       "foreach (1..1000000)" is now optimized into a counting loop.  It does not try to allocate a 1000000-size
       list anymore.

   <b>"Foo::"</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>implicitly</b> <b>quoted</b> <b>package</b> <b>name</b>
       Barewords  caused  unintuitive  behavior when a subroutine with the same name as a package happened to be
       defined.  Thus, "new Foo @args", use the result of the call to Foo() instead of "Foo" being treated as  a
       literal.   The recommended way to write barewords in the indirect object slot is "new Foo:: @args".  Note
       that the method new() is called with a first argument of "Foo", not "Foo::" when you do that.

   <b>"exists</b> <b>$Foo::{Bar::}"</b> <b>tests</b> <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>package</b>
       It was impossible to test for the existence of a  package  without  actually  creating  it  before.   Now
       "exists $Foo::{Bar::}" can be used to test if the "Foo::Bar" namespace has been created.

   <b>Better</b> <b>locale</b> <b>support</b>
       See perllocale.

   <b>Experimental</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>64-bit</b> <b>platforms</b>
       Perl5 has always had 64-bit support on systems with 64-bit longs.  Starting with 5.005, the beginnings of
       experimental support for systems with 32-bit long and 64-bit 'long long' integers has been added.  If you
       add  -DUSE_LONG_LONG  to  your  ccflags  in config.sh (or manually define it in perl.h) then perl will be
       built with 'long long' support.  There will be many compiler warnings, and the  resultant  perl  may  not
       work  on all systems.  There are many other issues related to third-party extensions and libraries.  This
       option exists to allow people to work on those issues.

   <b>prototype()</b> <b>returns</b> <b>useful</b> <b>results</b> <b>on</b> <b>builtins</b>
       See "prototype" in perlfunc.

   <b>Extended</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>exception</b> <b>handling</b>
       die() now accepts a reference value, and $@ gets set to that value in exception  traps.   This  makes  it
       possible to propagate exception objects.  This is an undocumented <b>experimental</b> feature.

   <b>Re-blessing</b> <b>in</b> <b>DESTROY()</b> <b>supported</b> <b>for</b> <b>chaining</b> <b>DESTROY()</b> <b>methods</b>
       See "Destructors" in perlobj.

   <b>All</b> <b>"printf"</b> <b>format</b> <b>conversions</b> <b>are</b> <b>handled</b> <b>internally</b>
       See "printf" in perlfunc.

   <b>New</b> <b>"INIT"</b> <b>keyword</b>
       "INIT"  subs  are like "BEGIN" and "END", but they get run just before the perl runtime begins execution.
       e.g., the Perl Compiler makes use of "INIT" blocks to initialize and resolve pointers to XSUBs.

   <b>New</b> <b>"lock"</b> <b>keyword</b>
       The "lock" keyword is the fundamental synchronization primitive in threaded perl.  When threads  are  not
       enabled, it is currently a noop.

       To  minimize  impact on source compatibility this keyword is "weak", i.e., any user-defined subroutine of
       the same name overrides it, unless a "use Thread" has been seen.

   <b>New</b> <b>"qr//"</b> <b>operator</b>
       The "qr//" operator, which is syntactically similar to the other quote-like operators, is used to  create
       precompiled  regular  expressions.   This compiled form can now be explicitly passed around in variables,
       and interpolated in other regular expressions.  See perlop.

   <b>"our"</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> <b>reserved</b> <b>word</b>
       Calling a subroutine with the name "our" will now provoke a warning when using the "-w" switch.

   <b>Tied</b> <b>arrays</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>fully</b> <b>supported</b>
       See Tie::Array.

   <b>Tied</b> <b>handles</b> <b>support</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b>
       Several missing hooks have been added.  There is also a new base class for TIEARRAY implementations.  See
       Tie::Array.

   <b>4th</b> <b>argument</b> <b>to</b> <b>substr</b>
       <b>substr()</b> can now both return and replace in one operation.  The optional 4th argument is the  replacement
       string.  See "substr" in perlfunc.

   <b>Negative</b> <b>LENGTH</b> <b>argument</b> <b>to</b> <b>splice</b>
       <b>splice()</b>  with  a  negative  LENGTH  argument  now  work  similar  to  what  the LENGTH did for <b>substr()</b>.
       Previously a negative LENGTH was treated as 0.  See "splice" in perlfunc.

   <b>Magic</b> <b>lvalues</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>more</b> <b>magical</b>
       When you say something like "substr($x, 5) = "hi"", the scalar returned by <b>substr()</b> is special,  in  that
       any  modifications to it affect $x.  (This is called a 'magic lvalue' because an 'lvalue' is something on
       the left side of an assignment.)  Normally, this is exactly what you would expect  to  happen,  but  Perl
       uses  the same magic if you use <b>substr()</b>, <b>pos()</b>, or <b>vec()</b> in a context where they might be modified, like
       taking a reference with "\" or as an argument to a sub that modifies  @_.   In  previous  versions,  this
       'magic'  only  went  one way, but now changes to the scalar the magic refers to ($x in the above example)
       affect the magic lvalue too. For instance, this code now acts differently:

           $x = "hello";
           sub printit {
               $x = "g'bye";
               print $_[0], "\n";
           }
           printit(substr($x, 0, 5));

       In previous versions, this would print "hello", but it now prints "g'bye".

   <b>&lt;&gt;</b> <b>now</b> <b>reads</b> <b>in</b> <b>records</b>
       If $/ is a reference to an integer, or a scalar that holds an integer, &lt;&gt; will read in records instead of
       lines. For more info, see "$/" in perlvar.

</pre><h4><b>Supported</b> <b>Platforms</b></h4><pre>
       Configure has many incremental improvements.   Site-wide  policy  for  building  perl  can  now  be  made
       persistent, via Policy.sh.  Configure also records the command-line arguments used in <u>config.sh</u>.

   <b>New</b> <b>Platforms</b>
       BeOS is now supported.  See <u>README.beos</u>.

       DOS is now supported under the DJGPP tools.  See <u>README.dos</u> (installed as perldos on some systems).

       MiNT is now supported.  See <u>README.mint</u>.

       MPE/iX is now supported.  See README.mpeix.

       MVS  (aka  OS390,  aka  Open Edition) is now supported.  See <u>README.os390</u> (installed as perlos390 on some
       systems).

       Stratus VOS is now supported.  See <u>README.vos</u>.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>existing</b> <b>support</b>
       Win32 support has been vastly enhanced.  Support for Perl Object, a C++ encapsulation of Perl.   GCC  and
       EGCS are now supported on Win32.  See <u>README.win32</u>, aka perlwin32.

       VMS configuration system has been rewritten.  See <u>README.vms</u> (installed as <u>README_vms</u> on some systems).

       The hints files for most Unix platforms have seen incremental improvements.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>existing</b> <b>modules</b>
       Benchmark
           You can now run tests for <u>x</u> seconds instead of guessing the right number of tests to run.

           Keeps better time.

       Carp
           Carp  has  a new function <b>cluck()</b>. <b>cluck()</b> warns, like <b>carp()</b>, but also adds a stack backtrace to the
           error message, like <b>confess()</b>.

       CGI CGI has been updated to version 2.42.

       Fcntl
           More Fcntl constants added: F_SETLK64, F_SETLKW64, O_LARGEFILE for large (more than 4G)  file  access
           (the  64-bit  support is not yet working, though, so no need to get overly excited), Free/Net/OpenBSD
           locking behaviour flags F_FLOCK, F_POSIX,  Linux  F_SHLCK,  and  O_ACCMODE:  the  mask  of  O_RDONLY,
           O_WRONLY, and O_RDWR.

       Math::Complex
           The  accessors  methods Re, Im, arg, abs, rho, theta, methods can ($z-&gt;<b>Re()</b>) now also act as mutators
           ($z-&gt;<b><a href="../man3/Re.3.html">Re</a></b>(3)).

       Math::Trig
           A little bit of radial trigonometry (cylindrical and spherical) added, for example the  great  circle
           distance.

       POSIX
           POSIX now has its own platform-specific hints files.

       DB_File
           DB_File supports version 2.x of Berkeley DB.  See "ext/DB_File/Changes".

       MakeMaker
           MakeMaker  now  supports  writing empty makefiles, provides a way to specify that site <b>umask()</b> policy
           should be honored.  There is also better support for manipulation of  .packlist  files,  and  getting
           information about installed modules.

           Extensions  that  have  both architecture-dependent and architecture-independent files are now always
           installed completely in the architecture-dependent locations.  Previously, the shareable  parts  were
           shared both across architectures and across perl versions and were therefore liable to be overwritten
           with newer versions that might have subtle incompatibilities.

       CPAN
           See perlmodinstall and CPAN.

       Cwd Cwd::cwd is faster on most platforms.

</pre><h4><b>Utility</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       "h2ph" and related utilities have been vastly overhauled.

       "perlcc", a new experimental front end for the compiler is available.

       The  crude GNU "configure" emulator is now called "configure.gnu" to avoid trampling on "Configure" under
       case-insensitive filesystems.

       "perldoc" used to be rather slow.  The slower features are now optional.  In particular, case-insensitive
       searches need the "-i" switch, and recursive searches need "-r".  You  can  set  these  switches  in  the
       "PERLDOC" environment variable to get the old behavior.

</pre><h4><b>Documentation</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       Config.pm now has a glossary of variables.

       <u>Porting/patching.pod</u> has detailed instructions on how to create and submit patches for perl.

       perlport specifies guidelines on how to write portably.

       perlmodinstall describes how to fetch and install modules from "CPAN" sites.

       Some more Perl traps are documented now.  See perltrap.

       perlopentut gives a tutorial on using <b>open()</b>.

       perlreftut gives a tutorial on references.

       perlthrtut gives a tutorial on threads.

</pre><h4><b>New</b> <b>Diagnostics</b></h4><pre>
       Ambiguous call resolved as CORE::%s(), qualify as such or use &amp;
           (W)  A  subroutine  you have declared has the same name as a Perl keyword, and you have used the name
           without qualification for calling one or the other.  Perl decided to call  the  builtin  because  the
           subroutine is not imported.

           To  force interpretation as a subroutine call, either put an ampersand before the subroutine name, or
           qualify the name with its package.  Alternatively, you can import the  subroutine  (or  pretend  that
           it's imported with the "use subs" pragma).

           To  silently  interpret  it  as  the  Perl  operator,  use  the "CORE::" prefix on the operator (e.g.
           CORE::log($x)) or by declaring the subroutine to be an object method (see "attrs").

       Bad index while coercing array into hash
           (F) The index looked up in the hash found as the 0'th element of a pseudo-hash is not  legal.   Index
           values must be at 1 or greater.  See perlref.

       Bareword "%s" refers to nonexistent package
           (W)  You  used  a  qualified bareword of the form "Foo::", but the compiler saw no other uses of that
           namespace before that point.  Perhaps you need to predeclare a package?

       Can't call method "%s" on an undefined value
           (F) You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot filled by the object reference or package name
           contains an undefined value.  Something like this will reproduce the error:

               $BADREF = 42;
               process $BADREF 1,2,3;
               $BADREF-&gt;process(1,2,3);

       Can't check filesystem of script "%s" for nosuid
           (P) For some reason you can't check the filesystem of the script for nosuid.

       Can't coerce array into hash
           (F) You used an array where a hash was expected, but the array has no information on how to map  from
           keys to array indices.  You can do that only with arrays that have a hash reference at index 0.

       Can't goto subroutine from an eval-string
           (F)  The  "goto  subroutine"  call can't be used to jump out of an eval "string".  (You can use it to
           jump out of an eval {BLOCK}, but you probably don't want to.)

       Can't localize pseudo-hash element
           (F) You said something like "local $ar-&gt;{'key'}", where $ar is a reference to  a  pseudo-hash.   That
           hasn't  been  implemented yet, but you can get a similar effect by localizing the corresponding array
           element directly: "local $ar-&gt;[$ar-&gt;[0]{'key'}]".

       Can't use %%! because Errno.pm is not available
           (F) The first time the %! hash is used, perl automatically  loads  the  Errno.pm  module.  The  Errno
           module is expected to tie the %! hash to provide symbolic names for $! errno values.

       Cannot find an opnumber for "%s"
           (F)  A  string of a form "CORE::word" was given to <b>prototype()</b>, but there is no builtin with the name
           "word".

       Character class syntax [. .] is reserved for future extensions
           (W) Within regular expression character classes ([]) the syntax beginning with "[." and  ending  with
           ".]"  is reserved for future extensions.  If you need to represent those character sequences inside a
           regular expression character class, just quote the square brackets  with  the  backslash:  "\[."  and
           ".\]".

       Character class syntax [: :] is reserved for future extensions
           (W)  Within  regular expression character classes ([]) the syntax beginning with "[:" and ending with
           ":]" is reserved for future extensions.  If you need to represent those character sequences inside  a
           regular  expression  character  class,  just  quote the square brackets with the backslash: "\[:" and
           ":\]".

       Character class syntax [= =] is reserved for future extensions
           (W) Within regular expression character classes ([]) the syntax beginning with "[=" and  ending  with
           "=]"  is reserved for future extensions.  If you need to represent those character sequences inside a
           regular expression character class, just quote the square brackets  with  the  backslash:  "\[="  and
           "=\]".

       %s: Eval-group in insecure regular expression
           (F) Perl detected tainted data when trying to compile a regular expression that contains the "(?{ ...
           })" zero-width assertion, which is unsafe.  See "(?{ code })" in perlre, and perlsec.

       %s: Eval-group not allowed, use re 'eval'
           (F)  A regular expression contained the "(?{ ... })" zero-width assertion, but that construct is only
           allowed when the "use re 'eval'" pragma is in effect.  See "(?{ code })" in perlre.

       %s: Eval-group not allowed at run time
           (F) Perl tried to compile a regular expression containing the "(?{ ... })"  zero-width  assertion  at
           run  time, as it would when the pattern contains interpolated values.  Since that is a security risk,
           it is not allowed.  If you insist, you may still do this by explicitly building the pattern  from  an
           interpolated string at run time and using that in an <b>eval()</b>.  See "(?{ code })" in perlre.

       Explicit blessing to '' (assuming package main)
           (W)  You  are  blessing  a  reference  to  a zero length string.  This has the effect of blessing the
           reference into the package main.  This is usually not what you want.  Consider  providing  a  default
           target package, e.g. bless($ref, $p || 'MyPackage');

       Illegal hex digit ignored
           (W)  You  may  have  tried  to  use  a  character  other than 0 - 9 or A - F in a hexadecimal number.
           Interpretation of the hexadecimal number stopped before the illegal character.

       No such array field
           (F) You tried to access an array as a hash, but the field name used is  not  defined.   The  hash  at
           index 0 should map all valid field names to array indices for that to work.

       No such field "%s" in variable %s of type %s
           (F)  You  tried  to  access  a field of a typed variable where the type does not know about the field
           name.  The field names are looked up in the %FIELDS hash in the type package at  compile  time.   The
           %FIELDS hash is usually set up with the 'fields' pragma.

       Out of memory during ridiculously large request
           (F)  You  can't allocate more than 2^31+"small amount" bytes.  This error is most likely to be caused
           by a typo in the Perl program. e.g., $arr[time] instead of $arr[$time].

       Range iterator outside integer range
           (F) One (or both) of the numeric arguments to the range operator ".."  are outside  the  range  which
           can  be  represented by integers internally.  One possible workaround is to force Perl to use magical
           string increment by prepending "0" to your numbers.

       Recursive inheritance detected while looking for method '%s' %s
           (F) More than 100 levels of inheritance were encountered while invoking a method.  Probably indicates
           an unintended loop in your inheritance hierarchy.

       Reference found where even-sized list expected
           (W) You gave a single reference where Perl was expecting a list with an even number of elements  (for
           assignment  to  a hash). This usually means that you used the anon hash constructor when you meant to
           use parens. In any case, a hash requires key/value <b>pairs</b>.

               %hash = { one =&gt; 1, two =&gt; 2, };   # WRONG
               %hash = [ qw/ an anon array / ];   # WRONG
               %hash = ( one =&gt; 1, two =&gt; 2, );   # right
               %hash = qw( one 1 two 2 );                 # also fine

       Undefined value assigned to typeglob
           (W) An undefined value was assigned to a typeglob, a la "*foo = undef".   This  does  nothing.   It's
           possible that you really mean "undef *foo".

       Use of reserved word "%s" is deprecated
           (D)  The  indicated bareword is a reserved word.  Future versions of perl may use it as a keyword, so
           you're better off either explicitly quoting the word in a manner appropriate for its context of  use,
           or  using  a different name altogether.  The warning can be suppressed for subroutine names by either
           adding a "&amp;" prefix, or using a package qualifier, e.g. &amp;our(), or Foo::our().

       perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
           (S) The whole warning message will look something like:

                  perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
                  perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
                          LC_ALL = "En_US",
                          LANG = (unset)
                      are supported and installed on your system.
                  perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale ("C").

           Exactly what were the failed locale settings varies.  In the above the settings were that the  LC_ALL
           was  "En_US"  and  the  LANG  had no value.  This error means that Perl detected that you and/or your
           system administrator have set up the so-called variable system but Perl could not use those settings.
           This was not dead serious, fortunately: there is a "default locale" called "C" that Perl can and will
           use, the script will be run.  Before you really fix the problem, however, you will get the same error
           message each time you run Perl.  How to really fix the problem can be found in "LOCALE  PROBLEMS"  in
           perllocale.

</pre><h4><b>Obsolete</b> <b>Diagnostics</b></h4><pre>
       Can't <b>mktemp()</b>
           (F) The <b>mktemp()</b> routine failed for some reason while trying to process a <b>-e</b> switch.  Maybe your <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>
           partition is full, or clobbered.

           Removed because <b>-e</b> doesn't use temporary files any more.

       Can't write to temp file for <b>-e</b>: %s
           (F)  The  write  routine failed for some reason while trying to process a <b>-e</b> switch.  Maybe your <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>
           partition is full, or clobbered.

           Removed because <b>-e</b> doesn't use temporary files any more.

       Cannot open temporary file
           (F) The create routine failed for some reason while trying to process a <b>-e</b> switch.  Maybe  your  <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>
           partition is full, or clobbered.

           Removed because <b>-e</b> doesn't use temporary files any more.

       regexp too big
           (F) The current implementation of regular expressions uses shorts as address offsets within a string.
           Unfortunately this means that if the regular expression compiles to longer than 32767, it'll blow up.
           Usually  when  you  want  a regular expression this big, there is a better way to do it with multiple
           statements.  See perlre.

</pre><h4><b>Configuration</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       You can use "Configure -Uinstallusrbinperl" which causes installperl to  skip  installing  perl  also  as
       /usr/bin/perl.   This  is  useful  if  you  prefer  not to modify <a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a> for some reason or another but
       harmful because many scripts assume to find Perl in /usr/bin/perl.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the headers  of  recently  posted  articles  in  the
       comp.lang.perl.misc  newsgroup.   There  may  also be information at <a href="http://www.perl.com/perl/">http://www.perl.com/perl/</a> , the Perl
       Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the <b>perlbug</b> program  included  with  your  release.
       Make  sure  you  trim  your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
       output of "perl -V", will be sent off to &lt;<u><a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.com">perlbug@perl.com</a></u>&gt; to be analysed by the Perl porting team.
