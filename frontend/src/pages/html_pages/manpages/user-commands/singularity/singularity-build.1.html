       singularity-build - Build a Singularity image

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>singularity</b> <b>build</b> <b>[local</b> <b>options...]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       IMAGE PATH:

       When Singularity builds the container, output can be one of a few formats:

         default:    The compressed Singularity read only image format (default)
         sandbox:    This is a read-write container within a directory structure

       note: It is a common workflow to use the "sandbox" mode for development of the
         container, and then build it as a default Singularity image for production
         use. The default format is immutable.

       BUILD SPEC:

       The build spec target is a definition (def) file, local image, or URI that can
         be used to create a Singularity container. Several different local target
         formats exist:

         def file  : This is a recipe for building a container (examples below)
         directory:  A directory structure containing a (ch)root file system
         image:      A local image on your machine (will convert to sif if
                     it is legacy format)

       Targets can also be remote and defined by a URI of the following formats:

         library://  an image library (default https://cloud.sylabs.io/library)
         docker://   a Docker/OCI registry (default Docker Hub)
         shub://     a Singularity registry (default Singularity Hub)
         oras://     an OCI registry that holds SIF files using ORAS

         COMMANDS:

             Build a sif file from a Singularity recipe file:
                 $ singularity build /tmp/debian0.sif /path/to/debian.def

             Build a sif image from the Library:
                 $ singularity build /tmp/debian1.sif library://debian:latest

             Build a base sandbox from DockerHub, make changes to it, then build sif
                 $ singularity build --sandbox /tmp/debian docker://debian:latest
                 $ singularity exec --writable /tmp/debian apt-get install python
