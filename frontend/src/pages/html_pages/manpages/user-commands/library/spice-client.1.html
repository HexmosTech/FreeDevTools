</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Spice-GTK - a client-side library to access remote SPICE displays

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Spice-GTK is a library allowing access to remote displays over the SPICE protocol. At the moment It's
       mainly used to access remote virtual machines.

       The Spice-GTK library provides a set of command line options which can be used to tweak some SPICE-
       specific option.

</pre><h4><b>URI</b></h4><pre>
       To initiate a plain SPICE connection (the connection will be unencrypted) to hostname.example.com and
       port 5900, use the following URI:

         spice://hostname.example.com:5900

       In order to start a TLS connection, one would use:

         spice+tls://hostname.example.com:5900

       Note: 'spice+tls' is available since v0.35, you have to use the spice:// query string with the 'tls-port'
       parameter before that.

</pre><h4><b>URI</b> <b>query</b> <b>string</b></h4><pre>
       spice URI accepts query string. Several parameters can be specified at once if they are separated by &amp; or
       ;

         spice://hostname.example.com?port=5900;tls-port=5901

       When using 'tls-port', it's recommended to not specify any non-TLS port.  If you give both 'port' and
       'tls-port', make sure you use the --spice-secure-channels options to indicate which channels must be
       secure.  Otherwise, Spice-GTK first attempts a connection to the non-TLS port, and then try to use the
       TLS port. This means a man-in-the-middle could force the whole SPICE session to go in clear text
       regardless of the TLS settings of the SPICE server.

       Other valid URI parameters are 'username' and 'password'. Be careful that passing a password through a
       SPICE URI might cause the password to be visible by any local user through 'ps'.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are accepted when running a SPICE client which makes use of the default Spice-GTK
       options:

       --spice-secure-channels=&lt;main,display,inputs,...,all&gt;
           Force the specified channels to be secured

           This  instructs  the SPICE client that it must use a TLS connection for these channels. If the server
           only offers non-TLS connections for these channels, the client will not use  these.  If  the  special
           value "all" is used, this indicates that all SPICE channels must be encrypted.

           The current SPICE channels are: main, display, inputs, cursor, playback, record, smartcard, usbredir.

       --spice-disable-effects=&lt;wallpaper,font-smooth,animation,all&gt;
           Disable guest display effects

           This  tells  the SPICE client that it should attempt to disable some guest features in order to lower
           bandwidth usage. This requires guest support, usually through a SPICE agent. This is  currently  only
           supported on Windows guests.

           "wallpaper"  will  disable  the  guest  wallpaper,  "font-smooth"  will  disable  font  antialiasing,
           "animation" will try to disable some of the desktop environment animations.  "all"  will  attempt  to
           disable everything which can be disabled.

       --spice-color-depth=&lt;16,32&gt;
           Guest display color depth - DEPRECATED

           This  tells  the SPICE client that it should attempt to force the guest OS color depth. A lower color
           depth should lower bandwith usage. This requires guest support, usually through a SPICE  agent.  This
           is currently only supported on Windows 7 and older guests.

       --spice-ca-file=&lt;file&gt;
           Truststore file for secure connections

           This  option is used to specify a .crt file containing the CA certificate with which the SPICE server
           TLS certificates are signed. This is useful when  using  self-signed  TLS  certificates  rather  than
           certificates signed by an official CA.

       --spice-host-subject=&lt;host-subject&gt;
           Subject of the host certificate (field=value pairs separated by commas)

           When  using  self-signed  certificates,  or  when  the guest is migrated between different hosts, the
           subject/altSubject of the TLS certificate the SPICE server will provide will  not  necessarily  match
           the hostname we are connecting to.  This option makes it possible to override the expected subject of
           the TLS certificate.

           The subject must correspond to the "Subject:" line returned by:
             openssl x509 -noout -text -in server-cert.pem

       --spice-debug
           Enable Spice-GTK debugging. This can also be toggled on with the SPICE_DEBUG environment variable, or
           using G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all

       --spice-disable-audio
           Disable audio support

       --spice-disable-usbredir
           Disable USB redirection support

       --spice-usbredir-auto-redirect-filter=&lt;filter-string&gt;
           Filter selecting USB devices to be auto-redirected when plugged in

           This  filter  specifies which USB devices should be automatically redirected when they are plugged in
           during the lifetime of a SPICE session.

           A rule has the form of: "class,vendor,product,version,allow"

           -1 can be used instead of class, vendor, product or version in order to  accept  any  value.  Several
           rules can be concatenated with '|': "rule1|rule2|rule3"

       --spice-usbredir-redirect-on-connect=&lt;filter-string&gt;
           Filter selecting USB devices to redirect on connect

           This filter specifies which USB devices should be automatically redirected when a SPICE connection to
           a remote display has been established.

       --spice-gtk-version
           Display Spice-GTK version information

       --spice-smartcard
           Enable smartcard support

       --spice-smartcard-db=&lt;certificate-db&gt;
           Path to the local certificate database to use for software smartcard certificates

           This  option is only useful for testing purpose. Instead of having a hardware smartcard reader, and a
           physical smartcard, you can specify a file containing 3 certificates which will be used to emulate  a
           smartcard                          in                          software.                          See
           "<a href="http://www.spice-space.org/page/SmartcardUsage">http://www.spice-space.org/page/SmartcardUsage</a>#Using_a_software_smartcard" for  more  details  about
           how to generate these certificates.

       --spice-smartcard-certificates=&lt;certificates&gt;
           Certificates to use for software smartcards (field=values separated by commas)

           This  option  is  only useful for testing purpose. This allows to specify which certificates from the
           certificate database specified with --spice-smartcard-db should be used for smartcard emulation.

       --spice-cache-size=&lt;bytes&gt;
           Image cache size - DEPRECATED

           This option should only be used for testing/debugging.

       --spice-glz-window-size=&lt;bytes&gt;
           Glz compression history size - DEPRECATED

           This option should only be used for testing/debugging.
