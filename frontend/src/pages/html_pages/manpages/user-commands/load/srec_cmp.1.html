       srec_cmp - compare two EPROM load files for equality

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>srec_cmp</b> [ <u>option</u>...  ] <u>filename</u>...
       <b>srec_cmp</b> <b>-Help</b>
       <b>srec_cmp</b> <b>-VERSion</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>srec_cmp</u> program is used to compare two EPROM load files for equality.  This comparison is performed
       irrespective of the load order of the data in each of the files.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Input may be qualified in two ways: you may specify a data file or a data generator.  format and you  may
       specify filters to apply to them.  An input file specification looks like this:
              <u>data‐file</u> [ <u>filter</u> ... ]
              <u>data‐generator</u> [ <u>filter</u> ... ]

   <b>Data</b> <b>Files</b>
       Input  from data files is specified by file name and format name.  An input file specification looks like
       this:
              <u>filename</u> [ <u>format</u> ][ -ignore‐checksums ]
       The default format is Motorola S‐Record format, but <u>many</u> others are also understood.

   <b>Data</b> <b>Generators</b>
       It is also possible to generate data, rather than read it from a file.  You may use a generator  anywhere
       you could use a file.  An input generator specification looks like this:
              <b>-GENerate</b> <u>address‐range</u> <b>-</b><u>data‐source</u>
       Generators include random data and various forms of constant data.

   <b>Common</b> <b>Manual</b> <b>Page</b>
       See  <u><a href="../man1/srec_input.1.html">srec_input</a></u>(1)  for  complete  details of input specifiers.  This description is in a separate manual
       page because it is common to more than one SRecord command.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>@</b><u>filename</u>
               The named text file is read for additional command line arguments.  Arguments  are  separated  by
               white  space  (space,  tab,  newline, <u>etc</u>).  There is no wildcard mechanism.  There is no quoting
               mechanism.  Comments, which start with '<b>#</b>' and extend to the end of the line, are ignored.  Blank
               lines are ignored.

       <b>-Help</b>
               Provide some help with using the <u>srec_cmp</u> program.

       <b>-IGnore_Checksums</b>
               The <b>-IGnore‐Checksums</b> option may be used to disable checksum validation of input files, for those
               formats which have checksums at all.  Note that the checksum values are still read in and  parsed
               (so  it  is  still an error if they are missing) but their values are not checked.  Used after an
               input file name, the option affects that file alone; used anywhere else on the command  line,  it
               applies to all following files.

       <b>-Enable_Sequence_Warnings</b>
               This  option  may  be used to enable warnings about input files where the data records are not in
               strictly ascending address order.  Only one warning is  issued  per  input  file.   This  is  the
               default.

               <b>Note:</b> the output of <u><a href="../man1/srec_cat.1.html">srec_cat</a></u>(1) is always in this order.

               <b>Note:</b> This option must be used <u>before</u> the input file.  This is because if there are several files
               on  the  command  line, each may need different settings.  The setting remains in force until the
               next <b>-Disable_Sequence_Warnings</b> option.

       <b>-Disable_Sequence_Warnings</b>
               This option may be used to disable warnings about input files where the data records are  not  in
               strictly ascending address order.

               <b>Note:</b>  This  option  must  be used <u>before</u> the offending input file.  This is because if there are
               several files on the command line, each may need different  settings.   The  setting  remains  in
               force until the next <b>-Ensable_Sequence_Warnings</b> option.

       <b>-redundant‐bytes=</b><u>value</u>
               Use  this  option  to  permit  a file to contain redundant values for some memory locations.  The
               default is for this condition to be a warning.

               ignore
                   No warning or error is issued whena redundant settings are detected.

               warning
                   A warning is issued when  a  redundant  settings  are  observed,  the  warning  includes  the
                   problematic address.

               error
                   A  fatal  error  is  issued  when  a redundant settings are observed, the fatal error message
                   includes the problematic address and byte value.

       <b>-contradictory‐bytes=</b><u>value</u>
               Use this option to permit a file to contain contradictory values for some memory locations.   The
               last value in the input(s) will be used.  The default is for this condition to be a fatal error.

               ignore
                   No warning or error is issued when contradictory setting is detected.

               warning
                   A  warning  is  issued  when  a vontradictory settings are observed, the warning includes the
                   problematic address, and values.

               error
                   A fatal error is issued when contradictory settings are observed,  the  fatal  error  message
                   includes the problematic address and byte values.

       <b>-VERSion</b>
               Print the version of the <u>srec_cmp</u> program being executed.

       <b>-Verbose</b>
               This  option  may  be  used  to obtain more information about how and where the two files differ.
               Please note that this takes longer, and the output can be voluminous.

       All other options will produce a diagnostic error.

       All options may be abbreviated; the abbreviation is documented as the upper case letters, all lower  case
       letters and underscores (_) are optional.  You must use consecutive sequences of optional letters.

       All options are case insensitive, you may type them in upper case or lower case or a combination of both,
       case is not important.

       For  example:  the  arguments “-help”, “-HEL” and “-h” are all interpreted to mean the <b>-Help</b> option.  The
       argument “-hlp” will not be understood, because consecutive optional characters were not supplied.

       Options and other command line arguments may be mixed arbitrarily on the command line.

       The GNU long option names are understood.  Since all option names  for  <u>srec_cmp</u>  are  long,  this  means
       ignoring the extra leading “-”.  The “<b>--</b><u>option</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>” convention is also understood.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>srec_cmp</u> command will exit with a status of 1 on any error.  The <u>srec_cmp</u> command will only exit with
       a status of 0 if there are no errors.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       A  common  use  for the <u>srec_cmp</u> command is to verify that a particular signature is present in the code.
       In this example, the signature is in a file called “signature[rq], and the  EPROM  image  is  in  a  file
       called  “image[rq].   We  assume  they are both Motorola S‐Record format, although this will work for all
       formats:
              srec_cmp signature  image -crop -within signature
       The signature need not be at the start of memory, nor need it be one single contiguous piece  of  memory.
       In  the  above  example, the portions of the image which have the same address range as the signature are
       compared with the signature.
