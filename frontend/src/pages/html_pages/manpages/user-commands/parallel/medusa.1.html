       MEDUSA - Parallel Network Login Auditor

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>medusa</b> [-h host|-H file] [-u username|-U file] [-p password|-P file] [-C file] -M module [OPTIONS]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Medusa</u>  is  intended  to  be  a  speedy, massively parallel, modular, login brute-forcer.  The goal is to
       support as many services which allow remote authentication as possible. The  author  considers  following
       items to some of the key features of this application:

       *Thread-based  parallel  testing.  Brute-force  testing can be performed against multiple hosts, users or
       passwords concurrently.

       *Flexible user input. Target information (host/user/password) can be specified in a variety of ways.  For
       example,  each  item  can be either a single entry or a file containing multiple entries. Additionally, a
       combination file format allows the user to refine their target listing.

       *Modular design. Each service module exists as an independent .mod file. This means that no modifications
       are necessary to the core application in order to extend  the  supported  list  of  services  for  brute-
       forcing.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b> <b>[TARGET]</b>
              Target hostname or IP address.

       <b>-H</b> <b>[FILE]</b>
              Reads  target  specifications from the file specified rather than from the command line.  The file
              should contain a list separated by newlines.

       <b>-u</b> <b>[TARGET]</b>
              Target username.

       <b>-U</b> <b>[FILE]</b>
              Reads target usernames from the file specified rather than from the command line.  The file should
              contain a list separated by newlines.

       <b>-p</b> <b>[TARGET]</b>
              Target password.

       <b>-P</b> <b>[FILE]</b>
              Reads target passwords from the file specified rather than from the command line.  The file should
              contain a list separated by newlines.

       <b>-C</b> <b>[FILE]</b>
              File containing combo entries. Combo files are  colon  separated  and  in  the  following  format:
              host:user:password.  If  any of the three fields are left empty, the respective information should
              be provided either as a single global value or as a list in a file.

              The following combinations are possible in the combo file: 1.) foo:bar:fud 2.) foo:bar: 3.)  foo::
              4.) :bar:fud 5.) :bar: 6.) ::fud 7.) foo::fud

              Medusa  also  supports  using  PwDump  files  as a combo file. The format of these files should be
              user:id:lm:ntlm:::. We look for ':::' at the end of the  first  line  to  determine  if  the  file
              contains PwDump output.

       <b>-O</b> <b>[FILE]</b>
              File  to  append log information to. Medusa will log all accounts credentials found to be valid or
              cause an unknown error. It will also log the start and stop times of  an  audit,  along  with  the
              calling parameters.

       <b>-e</b> <b>[n/s/ns]</b>
              Additional  password  checks ([n] No Password, [s] Password = Username). If both options are being
              used, they should be specified together ("-e ns"). If only a single option  is  being  called  use
              either "-e n" or "-e s".

       <b>-M</b> <b>[TEXT]</b>
              Name of the module to execute (without the .mod extension).

       <b>-m</b> <b>[TEXT]</b>
              Parameter to pass to the module. This can be passed multiple times with a different parameter each
              time and they will all be sent to the module (i.e.  -m Param1 -m Param2, etc.)

       <b>-d</b>     Dump all known modules.

       <b>-n</b> <b>[NUM]</b>
              Use for non-default TCP port number.

       <b>-s</b>     Enable SSL.

       <b>-g</b> <b>[NUM]</b>
              Give up after trying to connect for NUM seconds (default 3).

       <b>-r</b> <b>[NUM]</b>
              Sleep NUM seconds between retry attempts (default 3).

       <b>-R</b> <b>[NUM]</b>
              Attempt NUM retries before giving up. The total number of attempts will be NUM + 1.

       <b>-c</b> <b>[NUM]</b>
              Set  the  number  of  usec  that  are waited during a test of the established network socket. Some
              services (e.g. FTP, IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) may be configured to drop connections after an arbitrary
              number of failed logon attempts. We try to reuse the established connection to send authentication
              attempts until this disconnect  occurs,  at  which  point  the  connection  is  reestablished.  To
              accomplish  this,  we  check  the  socket  to see if it's still alive before authenticating within
              select modules. The default is perform a 1 usec check. It may be necessary to specify much  larger
              values. For example, a 1000 usec was needed against our test vsftp server to avoid issues with its
              built-in anti-bruteforce mechanisms.

       <b>-t</b> <b>[NUM]</b>
              Total  number  of  logins to be tested concurrently. It should be noted that roughly t x T threads
              could be running at any one time. 381 appears to be the limit on my  fairly  boring  Gentoo  Linux
              host.

       <b>-T</b> <b>[NUM]</b>
              Total number of hosts to be tested concurrently.

       <b>-L</b>     Parallelize  logins  using  one username per thread. The default is to process the entire username
              before proceeding.

       <b>-f</b>     Stop scanning host after first valid username/password found.

       <b>-F</b>     Stop audit after first valid username/password found on any host.

       <b>-b</b>     Suppress startup banner

       <b>-q</b>     Display module's usage information. This should be used in conjunction with the "-M"  option.  For
              example, "medusa -M smbnt -q".

       <b>-v</b> <b>[NUM]</b>
              Verbose  level [0 - 6 (more)]. All messages at or below the specified level will be displayed. The
              default level is 5.

              The following is the breakdown of the verbose levels: 0)   EXIT APPLICATION 1)    MESSAGE  WITHOUT
              TAG  2)    LOG MESSAGE WITHOUT TAG 3)   IMPORTANT MESSAGE 4)   ACCOUNT FOUND 5)   ACCOUNT CHECK 6)
              GENERAL MESSAGE

       <b>-w</b> <b>[NUM]</b>
              Error debug level [0 - 10 (more)]. All messages at or below the specified level will be displayed.
              The default level is 5.

              The following is the breakdown of the error levels: 0)   FATAL 1)   ALERT 2)   CRITICAL 3)   ERROR
              4)   WARNING 5)   NOTICE 6)   INFO 7)   DEBUG 8)   DEBUG - AUDIT 9)   DEBUG - SERVER 10)  DEBUG  -
              MODULE

       <b>-V</b>     Display version

       <b>-Z</b> <b>[TEXT]</b>
              Allows  basic  resuming  of  a  previous  scan.  The supplied parameter describes which hosts were
              completed, which were partially tested and which had not been started.   When  Medusa  receives  a
              SIGINT,  it  will  calculate and display a "resume map". This map can then be supplied to the next
              run. For example, "medusa [OPTIONS PREVIOUSLY USED] -Z h6u1u2h8.".  In  this  particular  example,
              hosts 1-5 were completed, host 6 was partially done (user 1 was partially completed and user 2 and
              beyond  had  not  been  started), host 7 was completed and host 8 and beyond had not been started.
              Medusa will parse this map and skip hosts and users accordingly. It should be noted that only host
              and user-level, not password-level, resuming is supported. If a user had been previously  started,
              but was not completed, it will be tested from the start of its respective password list.
