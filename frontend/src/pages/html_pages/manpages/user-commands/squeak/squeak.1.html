</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       squeak - Unix Squeak virtual machine launcher

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>squeak</b> <b>squeak</b> [<u>image</u> <u>filename</u>]  [<u>project</u> <u>filename</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>squeak</b>  is  the  virtual  machine  for  the  Squeak Smalltalk system.  It requires three files to operate
       correctly: an <b>image</b> file containing a `snapshot' of a live Squeak session, a <b>changes</b> file containing  the
       source  code for modified methods in the image, and a copy of (or a link to) a shared system <b>sources</b> file
       containing the source code for methods  that  have  not  been  modified  since  the  last  major  version
       increment.

       The  image  and  changes  files contain the state of a user's Squeak session, which is persistent between
       consecutive sessions.  Private copies of these files are therefore normally required.  The <b>squeak</b>  script
       checks that the local Squeak installation appears sane, and then copies the required files to the current
       working  directory.   If  <b>squeak</b>  encounters  no problems, it will finish by running <b>squeak</b> <b>vm</b> to start a
       Squeak session using the newly copied image and changes files.

</pre><h4><b>INVOCATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>squeak</b> accepts  an optional <u>image</u> name, and/or an optional <u>project</u> name.  If an <u>image</u> name  is  given  on
       the  command  line then <b>squeak</b> tries to run that image.  Otherwise <b>squeak</b> checks the environment variable
       <b>SQUEAK_IMAGE</b> and, if it is set, uses its value as the name of the image to run.  Otherwise  <b>squeak</b>  looks
       for available images in the <a href="file:~/squeak">~/squeak</a> and /usr/share/squeak directories.  Then, <b>squeak</b> shows a dialog with
       all  the  available images for the user to choose one of them. If the chosen image is at SQUEAK_IMAGE_DIR
       (which is by default /usr/share/squeak), it will be copied to  <a href="file:~/squeak.">~/squeak.</a>  If only one image is available,
       no dialog will be shown and the script will run that image.

       The <u>image</u> argument can be followed by a <u>project</u> name.  This is the name of a 'document' that should  have
       been saved from a Squeak image. The <u>project</u> name must have the '.pr' extension.

       The  <u>project</u>  argument  can also be providen without an image name. In that case, <b>squeak</b> will look for an
       image to run the project following the same criteria explained above.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       To know all the environment variables that can affect the squeak image launching,  take  a  look  at  the
       Environment section of the squeakvm man page.

       Appart from those options, these are applied to this script:

       <b>SQUEAK_IMAGE_DIR</b>
              is the directory, together with <a href="file:~/squeak">~/squeak</a> where the launcher looks for Squeak images.  (The default
              value is /usr/share/squeak)

       <b>SQUEAK_IMAGE</b>
              is the name of a image file to be run by the script.

       <b>SQUEAK</b> is  the  name of an alternative vm (or alternative vm options) to be run by the script. The script
              launches the vm with these default options: <b>'-mmap</b> <b>1024M</b> <b>-nomixer'</b>

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents version [version] of Unix Squeak.  It may not be  appropriate  for  any  other
       version.

       The image and changes files containing a saved Squeak session are intimately related.  They should always
       be  used  together,  never be separated, and under no circumstances should an image be run with a changes
       file that has been used with a different image.  Failure to adhere to the above could  cause  the  source
       code for the methods in the image to become garbled and impossible to retrieve.

       The  Unix  Squeak virtual machine fully supports OpenGL in both the X11 and Quartz display drivers.  Open
       Croquet will run just fine with either of these drivers (and many Mac OS  X  users  will  even  have  the
       choice of which driver to use :).

       Because  of licensing issues, a Squeak image or Squeak sources package is not available in Debian yet. So
       the user must download a proper image in order to get this script useful.  Available images can be  found
       in these web sites:
