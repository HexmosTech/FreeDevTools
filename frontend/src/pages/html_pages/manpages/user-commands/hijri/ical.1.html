</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ical - A Hijri/Islamic calendar (and converter)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ical</b> [<b>--gregorian</b> yyyymmdd] [<b>--hijri</b> yyyymmdd] [<b>--umm_alqura</b>] [<b>--fixed_view</b>] [<b>--dual</b>] [<b>--help</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>ical</b>  program  is a Hijri/Islamic calendar displayer.  It utilizes and includes a Gregorian to Hijri
       (and vice-versa) date converter.  The application uses and offers multiple calculation methods  with  not
       all of them agreeing at all times.  The reason for this multiplicity is due to not having one agreed upon
       method and so various entities develop and advocate their calculations.

       <b>ical</b> is able to comprehend and calculate both pre-epoch or pre-Hijrah, denoted as "B.H", as well as post-
       epoch  or post-Hijrah, denoted as "A.H", dates.  <b>ical</b> also utilizes Gregorian's pre-epoch "B.C" and post-
       epoch "A.D" dates and notes them per its output.  When entering pre-epoch years, negative  numbers  ought
       to be utilized.

       <b>ical</b>  when run without any command-line options uses the host machine's Gregorian date and converts it to
       Hijri to display that month's view.  Entries enclosed by [] denote exact day specified.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ical</b> follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting  with  two  dashes  (`-').   A
       summary of all options is noted below:

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Show summary of options

       <b>-g,</b> <b>--gregorian</b> <u>yyyymmdd</u>
              Specify  the  Gregorian  date to be converted where 'y' stands for year, 'm' for month and 'd' for
              day

       <b>-hi,</b> <b>--hijri</b> <u>yyyymmdd</u>
              Specify the Hijri date to be converted where 'y' stands for year, 'm' for month and 'd' for day

       <b>-u,</b> <b>--umm_alqura</b>
              Specify to use the Umm Al-Qura calculation method (used mostly in Saudi Arabia)

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--fixed_view</b>
              Show a fixed week view (ie. start on Sun and end on Sat) else default  to  showing  the  preferred
              week view of the resulting calendar (Gregorian starts on Sunday, Hijri starts on Saturday)

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--dual</b>
              Show both conversion from and to calendar months simultaneously

</pre><h4><b>BACKGROUND</b></h4><pre>
       The  Hijri calendar is used in most of the Arab world and is the symbolic calendar of the Islamic faithed
       worldwide.  This calendar is known as the "Hijri" (based on the word "Hijrah"  -  denoting  migration  in
       Arabic) to signal Prophet Mohammed's (PBUH) migration from Makkah to Medinah on Thursday, July 15, 622 AD
       (Julian).

       The  Islamic  Hijri  calendar  is  strictly  lunar (ie. moon-based) with twelve lunar months which do not
       correspond or track their solar counterparts (the Gregorian calendar is a solar or  sun-based  calendar).
       Lunar  years  and  thus  Hijri years are, on average, about 354 days long resulting in a Hijri year being
       roughly about 11 days shorter than its Gregorian counterpart.

       There is much discussion and confusion regarding how best to track the Hijri calendar.  A great  deal  of
       that confusion is based on the fact that many relay on a human moon sighting to denote the start (or end)
       of  a  month  (each  month of the Hijri calendar starts when a new moon's crescent is observed or is made
       visible at sunset) as opposed to using an empirical mathematic certainty.  The methods presented in  this
       application  and its underlying ITL library are strictly arithmetic in nature and do NOT take moon-phases
       into consideration (in short, observational approximation is not used).

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There is currently no Umm Al-Qura support.
