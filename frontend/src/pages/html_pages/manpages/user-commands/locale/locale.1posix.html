</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       locale — get locale-specific information

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       locale <b>[</b>-a|-m<b>]</b>

       locale <b>[</b>-ck<b>]</b> <u>name</u>...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>locale</u>  utility shall write information about the current locale environment, or all public locales,
       to the standard output. For the purposes of this  section,  a  <u>public</u>  <u>locale</u>  is  one  provided  by  the
       implementation that is accessible to the application.

       When  <u>locale</u> is invoked without any arguments, it shall summarize the current locale environment for each
       locale category as determined  by  the  settings  of  the  environment  variables  defined  in  the  Base
       Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Chapter</u> <u>7</u>, <u>Locale</u>.

       When  invoked  with operands, it shall write values that have been assigned to the keywords in the locale
       categories, as follows:

        *  Specifying a keyword name shall select the named keyword and the category containing that keyword.

        *  Specifying a category name shall select the named category and all keywords in that category.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>locale</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>12.2</u>,  <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-a</b>        Write  information  about  all  available  public  locales. The available locales shall include
                 <b>POSIX</b>, representing the POSIX locale. The manner in which the  implementation  determines  what
                 other locales are available is implementation-defined.

       <b>-c</b>        Write the names of selected locale categories; see the STDOUT section.  The <b>-c</b> option increases
                 readability  when  more  than  one category is selected (for example, via more than one keyword
                 name or via a category name).  It is valid both with and without the <b>-k</b> option.

       <b>-k</b>        Write the names and values of selected keywords. The implementation may omit  values  for  some
                 keywords; see the OPERANDS section.

       <b>-m</b>        Write  names  of  available  charmaps; see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u>
                 <u>6.1</u>, <u>Portable</u> <u>Character</u> <u>Set</u>.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <u>name</u>      The name of a locale category as defined  in  the  Base  Definitions  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,
                 <u>Chapter</u>  <u>7</u>,  <u>Locale</u>,  the name of a keyword in a locale category, or the reserved name <b>charmap</b>.
                 The named category or keyword shall be selected for output. If a single <u>name</u> represents both  a
                 locale  category  name  and  a keyword name in the current locale, the results are unspecified.
                 Otherwise, both category and keyword names can be specified as <u>name</u> operands, in any  sequence.
                 It is implementation-defined whether any keyword values are written for the categories <u>LC_CTYPE</u>
                 and <u>LC_COLLATE</u>.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>locale</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> for the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used  to affect the format and contents of diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

       The application shall ensure that the <u>LANG</u>, <u>LC_*</u>, and <u>NLSPATH</u> environment variables specify  the  current
       locale environment to be written out; they shall be used if the <b>-a</b> option is not specified.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>LANG</u> variable shall be written first using the format:

           "LANG=%s\n", &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;

       If <u>LANG</u> is not set or is an empty string, the value is the empty string.

       If  <u>locale</u>  is  invoked  without  any  options  or operands, the names and values of the <u>LC_*</u> environment
       variables described in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 shall be written to the standard output, one  variable
       per  line,  and each line using the following format. Only those variables set in the environment and not
       overridden by <u>LC_ALL</u> shall be written using this format:

           "%s=%s\n", &lt;<u>variable_name</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;

       The names of  those  <u>LC_*</u>  variables  associated  with  locale  categories  defined  in  this  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017  that  are  not  set  in the environment or are overridden by <u>LC_ALL</u> shall be written in the
       following format:

           "%s=\"%s\"\n", &lt;<u>variable_name</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>implied</u> <u>value</u>&gt;

       The &lt;<u>implied</u> <u>value</u>&gt; shall be the name of the locale that has been  selected  for  that  category  by  the
       implementation,  based  on  the values in <u>LANG</u> and <u>LC_ALL</u>, as described in the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Chapter</u> <u>8</u>, <u>Environment</u> <u>Variables</u>.

       The &lt;<u>value</u>&gt; and &lt;<u>implied</u> <u>value</u>&gt; shown above shall be properly quoted for possible later  reentry  to  the
       shell.  The  &lt;<u>value</u>&gt; shall not be quoted using double-quotes (so that it can be distinguished by the user
       from the &lt;<u>implied</u> <u>value</u>&gt; case, which always requires double-quotes).

       The <u>LC_ALL</u> variable shall be written last, using the first format shown above. If it is not set, it shall
       be written as:

           "LC_ALL=\n"

       If any arguments are specified:

        1. If the <b>-a</b> option is specified, the names of all the public locales shall  be  written,  each  in  the
           following format:

               "%s\n", &lt;<u>locale</u> <u>name</u>&gt;

        2. If  the  <b>-c</b>  option  is specified, the names of all selected categories shall be written, each in the
           following format:

               "%s\n", &lt;<u>category</u> <u>name</u>&gt;

           If keywords are also selected for writing (see following  items),  the  category  name  output  shall
           precede the keyword output for that category.

           If  the  <b>-c</b>  option  is  not  specified,  the  names of the categories shall not be written; only the
           keywords, as selected by the &lt;<u>name</u>&gt; operand, shall be written.

        3. If the <b>-k</b> option is specified, the names and values of selected keywords shall be written. If a value
           is non-numeric and is not a compound keyword value, it shall be written in the following format:

               "%s=\"%s\"\n", &lt;<u>keyword</u> <u>name</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>keyword</u> <u>value</u>&gt;

           If a value is a non-numeric compound keyword value, it shall either be written in the format:

               "%s=\"%s\"\n", &lt;<u>keyword</u> <u>name</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>keyword</u> <u>value</u>&gt;

           where the &lt;<u>keyword</u> <u>value</u>&gt; is a single string of values separated by  &lt;semicolon&gt;  characters,  or  it
           shall be written in the format:

               "%s=%s\n", &lt;<u>keyword</u> <u>name</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>keyword</u> <u>value</u>&gt;

           where  the  &lt;<u>keyword</u>  <u>value</u>&gt; is encoded as a set of strings, each enclosed in double-quotation-marks,
           separated by &lt;semicolon&gt; characters.

           If the keyword was <b>charmap</b>, the name of the charmap (if any) that was specified via the <u>localedef</u>  <b>-f</b>
           option when the locale was created shall be written, with the word <b>charmap</b> as &lt;<u>keyword</u> <u>name</u>&gt;.

           If a value is numeric, it shall be written in one of the following formats:

               "%s=%d\n", &lt;<u>keyword</u> <u>name</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>keyword</u> <u>value</u>&gt;

               "%s=%c%o\n", &lt;<u>keyword</u> <u>name</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>escape</u> <u>character</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>keyword</u> <u>value</u>&gt;

               "%s=%cx%x\n", &lt;<u>keyword</u> <u>name</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>escape</u> <u>character</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>keyword</u> <u>value</u>&gt;

           where the &lt;<u>escape</u> <u>character</u>&gt; is that identified by the <b>escape_char</b> keyword in the current locale; see
           the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>7.3</u>, <u>Locale</u> <u>Definition</u>.

           Compound  keyword  values  (list entries) shall be separated in the output by &lt;semicolon&gt; characters.
           When included in  keyword  values,  the  &lt;semicolon&gt;,  &lt;backslash&gt;,  double-quote,  and  any  control
           character shall be preceded (escaped) with the escape character.

        4. If  the  <b>-k</b>  option is not specified, selected keyword values shall be written, each in the following
           format:

               "%s\n", &lt;<u>keyword</u> <u>value</u>&gt;

           If the keyword was <b>charmap</b>, the name of the charmap (if any) that was specified via the <u>localedef</u>  <b>-f</b>
           option when the locale was created shall be written.

        5. If  the  <b>-m</b>  option is specified, then a list of all available charmaps shall be written, each in the
           format:

               "%s\n", &lt;<u>charmap</u>&gt;

           where &lt;<u>charmap</u>&gt; is in a format suitable for use as the option-argument to the <u>localedef</u> <b>-f</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    All the requested information was found and output successfully.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       If the <u>LANG</u> environment variable is not set or set to an empty value, or  one  of  the  <u>LC_*</u>  environment
       variables is set to an unrecognized value, the actual locales assumed (if any) are implementation-defined
       as described in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Chapter</u> <u>8</u>, <u>Environment</u> <u>Variables</u>.

       Implementations  are  not required to write out the actual values for keywords in the categories <u>LC_CTYPE</u>
       and <u>LC_COLLATE</u>; however, they must write out the categories (allowing an application  to  determine,  for
       example, which character classes are available).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       In the following examples, the assumption is that locale environment variables are set as follows:

           LANG=locale_x
           LC_COLLATE=locale_y

       The command <u>locale</u> would result in the following output:

           LANG=locale_x
           LC_CTYPE="locale_x"
           LC_COLLATE=locale_y
           LC_TIME="locale_x"
           LC_NUMERIC="locale_x"
           LC_MONETARY="locale_x"
           LC_MESSAGES="locale_x"
           LC_ALL=

       The order of presentation of the categories is not specified by this volume of POSIX.1‐2017.

       The command:

           LC_ALL=POSIX locale -ck decimal_point

       would produce:

           LC_NUMERIC
           decimal_point="."

       The  following  command  shows  an application of <u>locale</u> to determine whether a user-supplied response is
       affirmative:

           printf 'Prompt for response: '
           read response
           if printf "%s\n$response" | grep -- -Eq "$(locale yesexpr)"
           then
               affirmative processing goes here
           else
               non-affirmative processing goes here
           fi

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The output for categories <u>LC_CTYPE</u> and <u>LC_COLLATE</u> has been made implementation-defined because there is a
       questionable value in having a shell script receive an entire array of characters.  It is also  difficult
       to return a logical collation description, short of returning a complete <u>localedef</u> source.

       The <b>-m</b> option was included to allow applications to query for the existence of charmaps.  The output is a
       list of the charmaps (implementation-supplied and user-supplied, if any) on the system.

       The <b>-c</b> option was included for readability when more than one category is selected (for example, via more
       than one keyword name or via a category name). It is valid both with and without the <b>-k</b> option.

       The <b>charmap</b> keyword, which returns the name of the charmap (if any) that was used when the current locale
       was created, was included to allow applications needing the information to retrieve it.

       According  to  the  Base  Definitions  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>6.1</u>, <u>Portable</u> <u>Character</u> <u>Set</u>, the
       standard requires that all supported locales must have  the  same  encoding  for  &lt;period&gt;  and  &lt;slash&gt;,
       because  these  two  characters  are  used  within  the  locale-independent pathname resolution sequence.
       Therefore, it would be an error if <u>locale</u> <b>-a</b> listed both ASCII and EBCDIC-based locales, since those  two
       encodings  do not share the same representation for either &lt;period&gt; or &lt;slash&gt;.  Any system that supports
       both environments would be expected to provide two POSIX locales, one in either codeset, where  only  the
       locales  appropriate  to  the  current  environment  can  be  visible  at  a  time.  In  an XSI-compliant
       implementation, the <u>dd</u> utility is the only portable means for  performing  conversions  between  the  two
       character sets.
