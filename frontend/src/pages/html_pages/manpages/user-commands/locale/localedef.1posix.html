</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       localedef — define locale environment

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       localedef <b>[</b>-c<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-f <u>charmap</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b>-i <u>sourcefile</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b>-u <u>code_set_name</u><b>]</b> <u>name</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>localedef</u> utility shall convert source definitions for locale categories into a format usable by the
       functions and utilities whose operational behavior is determined by the setting of the locale environment
       variables  defined  in  the  Base  Definitions  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Chapter</u>  <u>7</u>,  <u>Locale</u>.   It   is
       implementation-defined  whether  users  have  the  capability to create new locales, in addition to those
       supplied by the implementation. If the symbolic constant POSIX2_LOCALEDEF is defined, the system supports
       the creation of new locales.  On XSI-conformant systems, the symbolic constant POSIX2_LOCALEDEF shall  be
       defined.

       The  utility shall read source definitions for one or more locale categories belonging to the same locale
       from the file named in the <b>-i</b> option (if specified) or from standard input.

       The <u>name</u> operand identifies the target locale. The utility shall  support  the  creation  of  <u>public</u>,  or
       generally  accessible  locales,  as  well  as  <u>private</u>, or restricted-access locales. Implementations may
       restrict the capability to create or modify public locales to users with appropriate privileges.

       Each category source definition shall be identified by the corresponding environment  variable  name  and
       terminated  by  an <b>END</b> <u>category-name</u> statement. The following categories shall be supported. In addition,
       the input may contain source for implementation-defined categories.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Defines character classification and case conversion.

       <u>LC_COLLATE</u>
                 Defines collation rules.

       <u>LC_MONETARY</u>
                 Defines the format and symbols used in formatting of monetary information.

       <u>LC_NUMERIC</u>
                 Defines the decimal delimiter, grouping, and grouping symbol for non-monetary numeric editing.

       <u>LC_TIME</u>   Defines the format and content of date and time information.

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Defines the format and values of affirmative and negative responses.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>localedef</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>12.2</u>, <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-c</b>        Create permanent output even if warning messages have been issued.

       <b>-f</b> <u>charmap</u>
                 Specify the pathname of a file containing a mapping of character symbols and collating  element
                 symbols  to  actual  character  encodings.   The format of the <u>charmap</u> is described in the Base
                 Definitions  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>6.4</u>,  <u>Character</u>  <u>Set</u>  <u>Description</u>  <u>File</u>.   The
                 application  shall ensure that this option is specified if symbolic names (other than collating
                 symbols defined in a <b>collating-symbol</b> keyword) are used. If the <b>-f</b> option is  not  present,  an
                 implementation-defined character mapping shall be used.

       <b>-i</b> <u>inputfile</u>
                 The pathname of a file containing the source definitions. If this option is not present, source
                 definitions  shall be read from standard input. The format of the <u>inputfile</u> is described in the
                 Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>7.3</u>, <u>Locale</u> <u>Definition</u>.

       <b>-u</b> <u>code_set_name</u>
                 Specify the name of a codeset used as the target mapping of  character  symbols  and  collating
                 element symbols whose encoding values are defined in terms of the ISO/IEC 10646‐1:2000 standard
                 position constant values.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <u>name</u>      Identifies the locale; see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Chapter</u> <u>7</u>, <u>Locale</u> for a
                 description  of the use of this name. If the name contains one or more &lt;slash&gt; characters, <u>name</u>
                 shall be interpreted as a pathname where the created locale definitions  shall  be  stored.  If
                 <u>name</u> does not contain any &lt;slash&gt; characters, the interpretation of the name is implementation-
                 defined and the locale shall be public. The ability to create public locales in this way may be
                 restricted  to  users  with  appropriate  privileges. (As a consequence of specifying one <u>name</u>,
                 although several categories can be processed in one execution, only categories belonging to the
                 same locale can be processed.)

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Unless the <b>-i</b> option is specified, the standard input shall be a text file containing one or more  locale
       category  source  definitions,  as described in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>7.3</u>,
       <u>Locale</u> <u>Definition</u>.  When lines are continued using the escape character mechanism, there is no  limit  to
       the length of the accumulated continued line.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The  character  set  mapping  file  specified  as  the  <u>charmap</u>  option-argument is described in the Base
       Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>6.4</u>, <u>Character</u> <u>Set</u> <u>Description</u> <u>File</u>.  If  a  locale  category
       source  definition  contains a <b>copy</b> statement, as defined in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
       <u>Chapter</u> <u>7</u>, <u>Locale</u>, and the <b>copy</b> statement names a valid, existing locale, then <u>localedef</u> shall behave  as
       if the source definition had contained a valid category source definition for the named locale.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>localedef</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> for the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_COLLATE</u>
                 (This variable has no affect on <u>localedef</u>; the POSIX locale is used for this category.)

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for  example,  single-byte  as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files).
                 This variable has no affect on the processing of <u>localedef</u> input data; the POSIX locale is used
                 for this purpose, regardless of the value of this variable.

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to  affect  the  format  and  contents  of  diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       The utility shall report all categories successfully processed, in an unspecified format.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The  format  of  the  created  output is unspecified. If the <u>name</u> operand does not contain a &lt;slash&gt;, the
       existence of an output file for the locale is unspecified.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       When the <b>-u</b> option is used, the <u>code_set_name</u> option-argument shall be interpreted as an  implementation-
       defined  name  of  a codeset to which the ISO/IEC 10646‐1:2000 standard position constant values shall be
       converted via an implementation-defined method. Both the ISO/IEC 10646‐1:2000 standard position  constant
       values  and  other  formats (decimal, hexadecimal, or octal) shall be valid as encoding values within the
       <u>charmap</u> file. The codeset represented by the implementation-defined name  can  be  any  codeset  that  is
       supported by the implementation.

       When  conflicts occur between the <u>charmap</u> specification of &lt;<u>code_set_name</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>mb_cur_max</u>&gt;, or &lt;<u>mb_cur_min</u>&gt;
       and the implementation-defined interpretation of these respective items for the  codeset  represented  by
       the <b>-u</b> option-argument <u>code_set_name</u>, the result is unspecified.

       When  conflicts  occur  between the <u>charmap</u> encoding values specified for symbolic names of characters of
       the portable character set and the implementation-defined assignment of character  encoding  values,  the
       result is unspecified.

       If  a  non-printable  character  in  the <u>charmap</u> has a width specified that is not <b>-1</b>, the result will be
       undefined.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    No errors occurred and the locales were successfully created.

        1    Warnings occurred and the locales were successfully created.

        2    The locale specification exceeded implementation limits or the coded character  set  or  sets  used
             were not supported by the implementation, and no locale was created.

        3    The capability to create new locales is not supported by the implementation.

       &gt;3    Warnings or errors occurred and no output was created.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       If an error is detected, no permanent output shall be created.

       If  warnings  occur,  permanent  output  shall  be  created if the <b>-c</b> option was specified. The following
       conditions shall cause warning messages to be issued:

        *  If a symbolic name not found in the <u>charmap</u> file is used for the  descriptions  of  the  <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  or
           <u>LC_COLLATE</u> categories (for other categories, this shall be an error condition).

        *  If the number of operands to the <b>order</b> keyword exceeds the {COLL_WEIGHTS_MAX} limit.

        *  If optional keywords not supported by the implementation are present in the source.

       Other implementation-defined conditions may also cause warnings.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>charmap</u>  definition  is  optional,  and is contained outside the locale definition. This allows both
       completely self-defined source files, and generic sources (applicable to more than one codeset).  To  aid
       portability,  all <u>charmap</u> definitions must use the same symbolic names for the portable character set. As
       explained in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>6.4</u>, <u>Character</u> <u>Set</u> <u>Description</u> <u>File</u>, it
       is implementation-defined whether or not users or  applications  can  provide  additional  character  set
       description files. Therefore, the <b>-f</b> option might be operable only when an implementation-defined <u>charmap</u>
       is named.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The  output  produced  by  the  <u>localedef</u>  utility is implementation-defined. The <u>name</u> operand is used to
       identify the specific locale. (As a consequence, although several categories  can  be  processed  in  one
       execution, only categories belonging to the same locale can be processed.)

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
