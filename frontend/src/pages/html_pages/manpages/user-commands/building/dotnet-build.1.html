              dotnet build -h|--help

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>dotnet</b>  <b>build</b>  command builds the project and its dependencies into a set of binaries.  The binaries
       include the project’s code in Intermediate Language (IL) files with a <u>.dll</u> extension.  Depending  on  the
       project type and settings, other files may be included, such as:

       • An  executable  that can be used to run the application, if the project type is an executable targeting
         .NET Core 3.0 or later.

       • Symbol files used for debugging with a <u>.pdb</u> extension.

       • A <u>.deps.json</u> file, which lists the dependencies of the application or library.

       • A <u>.runtimeconfig.json</u> file, which specifies the shared runtime and its version for an application.

       • Other libraries that the project depends on (via project references or NuGet package references).

       For executable projects targeting versions earlier than .NET Core 3.0, library  dependencies  from  NuGet
       are typically NOT copied to the output folder.  They’re resolved from the NuGet global packages folder at
       run  time.   With  that in mind, the product of <b>dotnet</b> <b>build</b> isn’t ready to be transferred to another ma‐
       chine to run.  To create a version of the application that can be deployed, you need to publish  it  (for
       example, with the dotnet publish command).  For more information, see .NET Application Deployment.

       For  executable projects targeting .NET Core 3.0 and later, library dependencies are copied to the output
       folder.  This means that if there isn’t any other publish-specific logic (such as Web projects have), the
       build output should be deployable.

   <b>Implicit</b> <b>restore</b>
       Building requires the <u>project.assets.json</u> file, which lists the dependencies of  your  application.   The
       file is created when <b>dotnet</b> <b>restore</b> is executed.  Without the assets file in place, the tooling can’t re‐
       solve reference assemblies, which results in errors.

       You  don’t  have to run <b>dotnet</b> <b>restore</b> because it’s run implicitly by all commands that require a restore
       to occur, such as <b>dotnet</b> <b>new</b>, <b>dotnet</b> <b>build</b>, <b>dotnet</b> <b>run</b>, <b>dotnet</b> <b>test</b>, <b>dotnet</b> <b>publish</b>, and <b>dotnet</b> <b>pack</b>.  To
       disable implicit restore, use the <b>--no-restore</b> option.

       The <b>dotnet</b> <b>restore</b> command is still useful in certain scenarios where explicitly restoring  makes  sense,
       such as continuous integration builds in Azure DevOps Services or in build systems that need to explicit‐
       ly control when the restore occurs.

       For information about how to manage NuGet feeds, see the <b>dotnet</b> <b>restore</b> documentation.

       This  command  supports  the <b>dotnet</b> <b>restore</b> options when passed in the long form (for example, <b>--source</b>).
       Short form options, such as <b>-s</b>, are not supported.

   <b>Executable</b> <b>or</b> <b>library</b> <b>output</b>
       Whether the project is executable or not is determined by the <b>&lt;OutputType&gt;</b> property in the project  file.
       The following example shows a project that produces executable code:

              &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
                &lt;OutputType&gt;Exe&lt;/OutputType&gt;
              &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;

       To  produce  a  library, omit the <b>&lt;OutputType&gt;</b> property or change its value to <b>Library</b>.  The IL DLL for a
       library doesn’t contain entry points and can’t be executed.

   <b>MSBuild</b>
       <b>dotnet</b> <b>build</b> uses MSBuild to build the project, so it supports both parallel and incremental builds.  For
       more information, see Incremental Builds.

       In addition to its options, the <b>dotnet</b> <b>build</b> command accepts MSBuild options,  such  as  <b>-p</b>  for  setting
       properties  or <b>-l</b> to define a logger.  For more information about these options, see the MSBuild Command-
       Line Reference.  Or you can also use the dotnet msbuild command.

              When <b>dotnet</b> <b>build</b> is run automatically by  <b>dotnet</b>  <b>run</b>,  arguments  like  <b>-property:property=value</b>
              aren’t respected.

       Running  <b>dotnet</b> <b>build</b> is equivalent to running <b>dotnet</b> <b>msbuild</b> <b>-restore</b>; however, the default verbosity of
       the output is different.

   <b>Workload</b> <b>manifest</b> <b>downloads</b>
       When you run this command, it initiates an asynchronous background download of advertising manifests  for
       workloads.   If  the  download is still running when this command finishes, the download is stopped.  For
       more information, see Advertising manifests.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>PROJECT</b> <b>|</b> <b>SOLUTION</b>

       The project or solution file to build.  If a project or solution file isn’t specified,  MSBuild  searches
       the  current  working  directory for a file that has a file extension that ends in either <u>proj</u> or <u>sln</u> and
       uses that file.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       • <b>-a|--arch</b> <b>&lt;ARCHITECTURE&gt;</b>

         Specifies the target architecture.  This is a shorthand  syntax  for  setting  the  Runtime  Identifier
         (RID),  where  the provided value is combined with the default RID.  For example, on a <b>win-x64</b> machine,
         specifying <b>--arch</b> <b>x86</b> sets the RID to <b>win-x86</b>.  If you use this option, don’t use the <b>-r|--runtime</b>  op‐
         tion.  Available since .NET 6 Preview 7.

       • <b>--artifacts-path</b> <b>&lt;ARTIFACTS_DIR&gt;</b>

         All  build output files from the executed command will go in subfolders under the specified path, sepa‐
         rated by project.  For more information see Artifacts Output Layout.  Available since .NET 8 SDK.

       • <b>-c|--configuration</b> <b>&lt;CONFIGURATION&gt;</b>

         Defines the build configuration.  The default for most projects is <b>Debug</b>,  but  you  can  override  the
         build configuration settings in your project.

       • <b>--disable-build-servers</b>

         Forces  the  command  to ignore any persistent build servers.  This option provides a consistent way to
         disable all use of build caching, which forces a build from scratch.  A  build  that  doesn’t  rely  on
         caches is useful when the caches might be corrupted or incorrect for some reason.  Available since .NET
         7 SDK.

       • <b>-f|--framework</b> <b>&lt;FRAMEWORK&gt;</b>

         Compiles  for  a  specific  framework.   The  framework must be defined in the project file.  Examples:
         <b>net7.0</b>, <b>net462</b>.

       • <b>--force</b>

         Forces all dependencies to be resolved even if the last restore was successful.  Specifying  this  flag
         is the same as deleting the <u>project.assets.json</u> file.

       • <b>-?|-h|--help</b>

         Prints out a description of how to use the command.

       • <b>--interactive</b>

         Allows the command to stop and wait for user input or action.  For example, to complete authentication.
         Available since .NET Core 3.0 SDK.

       • <b>--no-dependencies</b>

         Ignores project-to-project (P2P) references and only builds the specified root project.

       • <b>--no-incremental</b>

         Marks  the  build  as  unsafe  for  incremental build.  This flag turns off incremental compilation and
         forces a clean rebuild of the project’s dependency graph.

       • <b>--no-restore</b>

         Doesn’t execute an implicit restore during build.

       • <b>--nologo</b>

         Doesn’t display the startup banner or the copyright message.

       • <b>--no-self-contained</b>

         Publishes the application as a framework dependent application.  A compatible .NET runtime must be  in‐
         stalled on the target machine to run the application.  Available since .NET 6 SDK.

       • <b>-o|--output</b> <b>&lt;OUTPUT_DIRECTORY&gt;</b>

         Directory  in which to place the built binaries.  If not specified, the default path is <b>.<a href="file:/bin/">/bin/</a>&lt;configu‐</b>
         <b>ration&gt;/&lt;framework&gt;/</b>.  For projects with multiple target frameworks (via the  <b>TargetFrameworks</b>  proper‐
         ty), you also need to define <b>--framework</b> when you specify this option.

         • .NET 7.0.200 SDK and later

           If you specify the <b>--output</b> option when running this command on a solution, the CLI will emit a warn‐
           ing  (an  error  in 7.0.200) due to the unclear semantics of the output path.  The <b>--output</b> option is
           disallowed because all outputs of all built projects would be copied into  the  specified  directory,
           which isn’t compatible with multi-targeted projects, as well as projects that have different versions
           of  direct  and transitive dependencies.  For more information, see Solution-level <b>--output</b> option no
           longer valid for build-related commands.

       • <b>--os</b> <b>&lt;OS&gt;</b>

         Specifies the target operating system (OS).  This is a shorthand syntax for setting the Runtime Identi‐
         fier (RID), where the provided value is combined with the default RID.  For example, on a  <b>win-x64</b>  ma‐
         chine,  specifying  <b>--os</b>  <b>linux</b>  sets  the  RID  to  <b>linux-x64</b>.   If you use this option, don’t use the
         <b>-r|--runtime</b> option.  Available since .NET 6.

       • <b>-p|--property:&lt;PROPERTYNAME&gt;=&lt;VALUE&gt;</b>

         Sets one or more MSBuild properties.  Specify multiple properties delimited by semicolons or by repeat‐
         ing the option:

                --property:&lt;NAME1&gt;=&lt;VALUE1&gt;;&lt;NAME2&gt;=&lt;VALUE2&gt;
                --property:&lt;NAME1&gt;=&lt;VALUE1&gt; --property:&lt;NAME2&gt;=&lt;VALUE2&gt;

       • <b>-r|--runtime</b> <b>&lt;RUNTIME_IDENTIFIER&gt;</b>

         Specifies the target runtime.  For a list of Runtime Identifiers (RIDs), see the RID catalog.   If  you
         use  this  option with .NET 6 SDK, use <b>--self-contained</b> or <b>--no-self-contained</b> also.  If not specified,
         the default is to build for the current OS and architecture.

       • <b>--self-contained</b> <b>[true|false]</b>

         Publishes the .NET runtime with the application so the runtime doesn’t need to be installed on the tar‐
         get machine.  The default is <b>true</b> if a runtime identifier is specified.  Available since .NET 6.

       • <b>--source</b> <b>&lt;SOURCE&gt;</b>

         The URI of the NuGet package source to use during the restore operation.

       • <b>--tl:[auto|on|off]</b>

         Specifies whether the <u>terminal</u> <u>logger</u> should be used for the build output.  The default is <b>auto</b>,  which
         first  verifies  the environment before enabling terminal logging.  The environment check verifies that
         the terminal is capable of using modern output features and isn’t using a  redirected  standard  output
         before  enabling  the  new  logger.   <b>on</b> skips the environment check and enables terminal logging.  <b>off</b>
         skips the environment check and uses the default console logger.

         The terminal logger shows you the restore phase followed by the build phase.  During  each  phase,  the
         currently building projects appear at the bottom of the terminal.  Each project that’s building outputs
         both  the  MSBuild  target  currently being built and the amount of time spent on that target.  You can
         search this information to learn more about the build.  When a project is finished building,  a  single
         “build completed” section is written that captures:

         • The name of the built project.

         • The target framework (if multi-targeted).

         • The status of that build.

         • The primary output of that build (which is hyperlinked).

         • Any diagnostics generated for that project.

         This option is available starting in .NET 8.

       • <b>-v|--verbosity</b> <b>&lt;LEVEL&gt;</b>

         Sets  the verbosity level of the command.  Allowed values are <b>q[uiet]</b>, <b>m[inimal]</b>, <b>n[ormal]</b>, <b>d[etailed]</b>,
         and <b>diag[nostic]</b>.  The default is <b>minimal</b>.  By default, MSBuild displays warnings  and  errors  at  all
         verbosity  levels.   To  exclude  warnings,  use  <b>/property:WarningLevel=0</b>.   For more information, see
         &lt;xref:Microsoft.Build.Framework.LoggerVerbosity&gt; and WarningLevel.

       • <b>--use-current-runtime,</b> <b>--ucr</b> <b>[true|false]</b>

         Sets the <b>RuntimeIdentifier</b> to a platform portable <b>RuntimeIdentifier</b> based on the one of  your  machine.
         This  happens  implicitly with properties that require a <b>RuntimeIdentifier</b>, such as <b>SelfContained</b>, <b>Pub‐</b>
         <b>lishAot</b>, <b>PublishSelfContained</b>, <b>PublishSingleFile</b>, and <b>PublishReadyToRun</b>.  If the  property  is  set  to
         false, that implicit resolution will no longer occur.

       • <b>--version-suffix</b> <b>&lt;VERSION_SUFFIX&gt;</b>

         Sets  the  value of the <b>$(VersionSuffix)</b> property to use when building the project.  This only works if
         the <b>$(Version)</b> property isn’t set.  Then, <b>$(Version)</b> is set to the <b>$(VersionPrefix)</b> combined  with  the
         <b>$(VersionSuffix)</b>, separated by a dash.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       • Build a project and its dependencies:

                dotnet build

       • Build a project and its dependencies using Release configuration:

                dotnet build --configuration Release

       • Build a project and its dependencies for a specific runtime (in this example, Linux):

                dotnet build --runtime linux-x64

       • Build the project and use the specified NuGet package source during the restore operation:

                dotnet build --source c:\packages\mypackages

       • Build the project and set version 1.2.3.4 as a build parameter using the <b>-p</b> MSBuild option:

                dotnet build -p:Version=1.2.3.4
