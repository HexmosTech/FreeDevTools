</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dh_installman - install man pages into package build directories

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dh_installman</b> [<u>debhelper</u> <u>options</u>] [<u>manpage</u> ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dh_installman</b> is a debhelper program that handles installing man pages into the correct locations in
       package build directories.

       In compat 10 and earlier, this program was primarily for when upstream's build system does not properly
       install them as a part of its install step (or it does not have an install step).  In compat 11 and
       later, it also supports the default searchdir plus --sourcedir like <b><a href="../man1/dh_install.1.html">dh_install</a></b>(1) and has the advantage
       that it respects the nodoc build profile (unlike <b><a href="../man1/dh_install.1.html">dh_install</a></b>(1)).

       Even if you prefer to use <b><a href="../man1/dh_install.1.html">dh_install</a></b>(1) for installing the manpages, <b>dh_installman</b> can still be useful
       for converting the manpage encoding to UTF-8 and for converting <u>.so</u> links (as described below).  However,
       that part happens automatically without any explicit configuration.

       You tell <b>dh_installman</b> what man pages go in your packages, and it figures out where to install them based
       on the section field in their <b>.TH</b> or <b>.Dt</b> line. If you have a properly formatted <b>.TH</b> or <b>.Dt</b> line, your man
       page will be installed into the right directory, with the right name (this includes proper handling of
       pages with a subsection, like <b>3perl</b>, which are placed in <u>man3</u>, and given an extension of <u>.3perl</u>). If your
       <b>.TH</b> or <b>.Dt</b> line is incorrect or missing, the program may guess wrong based on the file extension.

       It also supports translated man pages, by looking for extensions like <u>.ll.8</u> and <u>.ll_LL.8</u>, or by use of
       the <b>--language</b> switch.

       If <b>dh_installman</b> seems to install a man page into the wrong section or with the wrong extension, this is
       because the man page has the wrong section listed in its <b>.TH</b> or <b>.Dt</b> line. Edit the man page and correct
       the section, and <b>dh_installman</b> will follow suit. See <b><a href="../man7/man.7.html">man</a></b>(7) for details about the <b>.TH</b> section, and
       <b><a href="../man7/mdoc.7.html">mdoc</a></b>(7) for the <b>.Dt</b> section. If <b>dh_installman</b> seems to install a man page into a directory like
       <u><a href="file:/usr/share/man/pl/man1/">/usr/share/man/pl/man1/</a></u>, that is because your program has a name like <u>foo.pl</u>, and <b>dh_installman</b> assumes
       that means it is translated into Polish. Use <b>--language=C</b> to avoid this.

       After the man page installation step, <b>dh_installman</b> will check to see if any of the man pages in the
       temporary directories of any of the packages it is acting on contain <u>.so</u> links. If so, it changes them to
       symlinks.

       Also, <b>dh_installman</b> will use man to guess the character encoding of each manual page and convert it to
       UTF-8. If the guesswork fails for some reason, you can override it using an encoding declaration. See
       <b><a href="../man1/manconv.1.html">manconv</a></b>(1) for details.

       From debhelper compatibility level 11 on, <b>dh_install</b> will fall back to looking in <u>debian/tmp</u> for files,
       if it does not find them in the current directory (or wherever you've told it to look using <b>--sourcedir</b>).

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       debian/<u>package</u>.manpages
           Lists man pages to be installed.

           Supports substitution variables in compat 13 and later as documented in <b><a href="../man7/debhelper.7.html">debhelper</a></b>(7).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-A</b>, <b>--all</b>
           Install all files specified by command line parameters in ALL packages acted on.

       <b>--language=</b><u>ll</u>
           Use this to specify that the man pages being acted on are written in the specified language.

       <b>--sourcedir=</b><u>dir</u>
           Look  in  the specified directory for files to be installed.  This option requires compat 11 or later
           (it is silently ignored in compat 10 or earlier).

           Note that this is not the same as the <b>--sourcedirectory</b> option used by the  <b>dh_auto_</b><u>*</u>  commands.  You
           rarely  need  to  use this option, since <b>dh_installman</b> automatically looks for files in <u>debian/tmp</u> in
           debhelper compatibility level 11 and above.

       <u>manpage</u> ...
           Install these man pages into the first package acted on. (Or in all packages if <b>-A</b> is specified).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       An example <u>debian/package.manpages</u> file could look like this:

         doc/man/foo.1
         # Translations
         doc/man/foo.da.1
         doc/man/foo.de.1
         doc/man/foo.fr.1
         # NB: The following line is considered a polish translation
         # of "foo.1" (and not a manpage written in perl called "foo.pl")
         doc/man/foo.pl.1
         # ...

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       An older version of this program, <b><a href="../man1/dh_installmanpages.1.html">dh_installmanpages</a></b>(1), is still used by some packages, and so is  still
       included  in  debhelper.   It  is,  however,  deprecated,  due  to  its counterintuitive and inconsistent
       interface. Use this program instead.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="../man7/debhelper.7.html">debhelper</a></b>(7)

       This program is a part of debhelper.
