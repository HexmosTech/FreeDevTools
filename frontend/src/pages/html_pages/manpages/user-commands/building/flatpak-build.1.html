</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       flatpak-build - Build in a directory

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>flatpak</b> <b>build</b> [OPTION...] DIRECTORY [COMMAND [ARG...]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Runs a build command in a directory.  DIRECTORY must have been initialized with <b>flatpak</b> <b>build-init</b>.

       The sdk that is specified in the metadata file in the directory is mounted at <a href="file:/usr">/usr</a> and the files and var
       subdirectories are mounted at <a href="file:/app">/app</a> and <a href="file:/var">/var</a>, respectively. They are writable, and their contents are
       preserved between build commands, to allow accumulating build artifacts there.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show help options and exit.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Print debug information during command processing.

       <b>--ostree-verbose</b>
           Print OSTree debug information during command processing.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--runtime</b>
           Use the non-devel runtime that is specified in the application metadata instead of the devel runtime.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--die-with-parent</b>
           Kill the build process and all children when the launching process dies.

       <b>--bind-mount=DEST=SOURCE</b>
           Add a custom bind mount in the build namespace. Can be specified multiple times.

       <b>--build-dir=PATH</b>
           Start the build in this directory (default is in the current directory).

       <b>--share=SUBSYSTEM</b>
           Share a subsystem with the host session. This overrides the Context section from the application
           metadata.  SUBSYSTEM must be one of: network, ipc. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--unshare=SUBSYSTEM</b>
           Don't share a subsystem with the host session. This overrides the Context section from the
           application metadata.  SUBSYSTEM must be one of: network, ipc. This option can be used multiple
           times.

       <b>--socket=SOCKET</b>
           Expose a well-known socket to the application. This overrides to the Context section from the
           application metadata.  SOCKET must be one of: x11, wayland, fallback-x11, pulseaudio, system-bus,
           session-bus, ssh-auth, pcsc, cups, gpg-agent, inherit-wayland-socket. This option can be used
           multiple times.

       <b>--nosocket=SOCKET</b>
           Don't expose a well-known socket to the application. This overrides to the Context section from the
           application metadata.  SOCKET must be one of: x11, wayland, fallback-x11, pulseaudio, system-bus,
           session-bus, ssh-auth, pcsc, cups, gpg-agent, inherit-wayland-socket. This option can be used
           multiple times.

       <b>--device=DEVICE</b>
           Expose a device to the application. This overrides to the Context section from the application
           metadata.  DEVICE must be one of: dri, input, usb, kvm, shm, all. This option can be used multiple
           times.

       <b>--nodevice=DEVICE</b>
           Don't expose a device to the application. This overrides to the Context section from the application
           metadata.  DEVICE must be one of: dri, input, usb, kvm, shm, all. This option can be used multiple
           times.

       <b>--allow=FEATURE</b>
           Allow access to a specific feature. This updates the [Context] group in the metadata.  FEATURE must
           be one of: devel, multiarch, bluetooth, canbus, per-app-dev-shm. This option can be used multiple
           times.

           See <b><a href="../man1/flatpak-build-finish.1.html">flatpak-build-finish</a></b>(1) for the meaning of the various features.

       <b>--disallow=FEATURE</b>
           Disallow access to a specific feature. This updates the [Context] group in the metadata.  FEATURE
           must be one of: devel, multiarch, bluetooth, canbus, per-app-dev-shm. This option can be used
           multiple times.

       <b>--filesystem=FILESYSTEM[:ro|:create]</b>
           Allow the application access to a subset of the filesystem. This overrides to the Context section
           from the application metadata.  FILESYSTEM can be one of: home, host, host-os, host-etc, xdg-desktop,
           xdg-documents, xdg-download, xdg-music, xdg-pictures, xdg-public-share, xdg-templates, xdg-videos,
           xdg-run, xdg-config, xdg-cache, xdg-data, an absolute path, or a homedir-relative path like <a href="file:~/dir">~/dir</a> or
           paths relative to the xdg dirs, like xdg-download/subdir. The optional :ro suffix indicates that the
           location will be read-only. The optional :create suffix indicates that the location will be
           read-write and created if it doesn't exist. This option can be used multiple times. See the
           "[Context] filesystems" list in <b><a href="../man5/flatpak-metadata.5.html">flatpak-metadata</a></b>(5) for details of the meanings of these filesystems.

       <b>--nofilesystem=FILESYSTEM</b>
           Remove access to the specified subset of the filesystem from the application. This overrides to the
           Context section from the application metadata.  FILESYSTEM can be one of: home, host, host-os,
           host-etc, xdg-desktop, xdg-documents, xdg-download, xdg-music, xdg-pictures, xdg-public-share,
           xdg-templates, xdg-videos, an absolute path, or a homedir-relative path like <a href="file:~/dir.">~/dir.</a> This option can
           be used multiple times.

       <b>--with-appdir</b>
           Expose and configure access to the per-app storage directory in $HOME/.var/app. This is not normally
           useful when building, but helps when testing built apps.

       <b>--add-policy=SUBSYSTEM.KEY=VALUE</b>
           Add generic policy option. For example, "--add-policy=subsystem.key=v1 --add-policy=subsystem.key=v2"
           would map to this metadata:

               [Policy subsystem]
               key=v1;v2;

           This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--remove-policy=SUBSYSTEM.KEY=VALUE</b>
           Remove generic policy option. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--env=VAR=VALUE</b>
           Set an environment variable in the application. This overrides to the Context section from the
           application metadata. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--unset-env=VAR</b>
           Unset an environment variable in the application. This overrides the unset-environment entry in the
           [Context] group of the metadata, and the [Environment] group. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--env-fd=</b><u>FD</u>
           Read environment variables from the file descriptor <u>FD</u>, and set them as if via <b>--env</b>. This can be
           used to avoid environment variables and their values becoming visible to other users.

           Each environment variable is in the form <u>VAR</u>=<u>VALUE</u> followed by a zero byte. This is the same format
           used by env -0 and <a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>*/environ.

       <b>--own-name=NAME</b>
           Allow the application to own the well-known name NAME on the session bus. This overrides to the
           Context section from the application metadata. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--talk-name=NAME</b>
           Allow the application to talk to the well-known name NAME on the session bus. This overrides to the
           Context section from the application metadata. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--system-own-name=NAME</b>
           Allow the application to own the well-known name NAME on the system bus. This overrides to the
           Context section from the application metadata. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--system-talk-name=NAME</b>
           Allow the application to talk to the well-known name NAME on the system bus. This overrides to the
           Context section from the application metadata. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--persist=FILENAME</b>
           If the application doesn't have access to the real homedir, make the (homedir-relative) path FILENAME
           a bind mount to the corresponding path in the per-application directory, allowing that location to be
           used for persistent data. This overrides to the Context section from the application metadata. This
           option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--sdk-dir=DIR</b>
           Normally if there is a usr directory in the build dir, this is used for the runtime files (this can
           be created by <b>--writable-sdk</b> or <b>--type=runtime</b> arguments to build-init). If you specify <b>--sdk-dir</b>,
           this directory will be used instead. Use this if you passed <b>--sdk-dir</b> to build-init.

       <b>--readonly</b>
           Mount the normally writable destination directories read-only. This can be useful if you want to run
           something in the sandbox but guarantee that it doesn't affect the build results. For example tests.

       <b>--metadata=FILE</b>
           Use the specified filename as metadata in the exported app instead of the default file (called
           metadata). This is useful if you build multiple things from a single build tree (such as both a
           platform and a sdk).

       <b>--log-session-bus</b>
           Log session bus traffic. This can be useful to see what access you need to allow in your D-Bus
           policy.

       <b>--log-system-bus</b>
           Log system bus traffic. This can be useful to see what access you need to allow in your D-Bus policy.
