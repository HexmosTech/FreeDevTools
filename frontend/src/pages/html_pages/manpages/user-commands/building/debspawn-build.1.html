       debspawn-build - Build Debian packages in a container

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>debspawn</b> <b>build</b> [-h|--help] [--variant] [-a|--arch] [--suite] [--sign] [--only] [--include-orig]
                      [--buildflags] [--results-dir] [--maintainer] [--clean-source] [--lintian] [--no-buildlog]
                      [-i|--interact] [-e|--setenv] {SUITE} [DIR|DSC_FILE]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Build a Debian package from a directory or source package *.dsc file.  <b>debspawn</b> will create a new
       container for the respective build using the base image specified, build the package and return build
       artifacts in the default output directory /var/lib/debspawn/results/ unless a different location was
       specified via the <b>--results-dir</b> flag.

       Downloaded packages that are build dependencies are cached and will be reused on subsequent builds if
       possible.

       You can inject packages into the build environment that are not available in the preconfigured APT
       repositories by placing them in /var/lib/debspawn/injected-pkgs/${container-name}, or in
       /var/lib/debspawn/injected-pkgs/ to make a package available in all environments. Internally, <b>debspawn</b>
       will build a transient package repository with the respective packages and add it as a package source for
       APT.

       If you want to debug the package build process, you can pass the <b>--interact</b> flag to <b>debspawn</b>. This will
       open an interactive root shell in the build environment post-build, no matter whether the build failed or
       succeeded. After investigating the issue / building the package manually, the shell can be exited and the
       user is asked whether <b>debspawn</b> should copy back the changes made in the packages' debian/ directory to
       the host to make them permanent. Please keep in mind that while interactive mode is enabled, no build log
       can be created.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       You can build a package from its source directory, or just by passing a plain .dsc file to <b>debspawn</b>
       <b>build</b>. If the result should be automatically signed, the <b>--sign</b> flag needs to be passed too:

                          $ <b>cd</b> <a href="file:~/packages/hello">~/packages/hello</a>
                          $ <b>debspawn</b> <b>build</b> sid --sign

                          $ <b>debspawn</b> <b>build</b> --arch=i386 cosmic ./hello_2.10-1.dsc

       You can also build packages using <b>git-buildpackage</b> and <b>debspawn</b>. In this case the <b>--lintian</b> flag is also
       used to perform a Lintian static analysis check in the container after build:

                          $ <b>gbp</b> <b>buildpackage</b> --git-builder='debspawn b sid --lintian --sign'

       To debug a build issue interactively, the <b>--interact</b> flag can be used:

                          $ <b>debspawn</b> <b>build</b> sid --interact

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -h|--help
           Print brief help information about available commands.

       --variant
           Set the variant of the selected image, that was used for bootstrapping.

       -a|--arch
           The architecture of the base image that should be selected.

       --suite
           Explicitly set a suite name (instead of having it derived from the container name).

       --sign
           Sign the resulting package.

       --only
           Select only a specific set of packages to be built. Choices are: <b>binary</b>: Build only binary packages,
           no source files are to be built and/or distributed.  <b>arch</b>: Build only architecture-specific binary
           packages.  <b>indep</b>: Build only architecture-independent (arch:all) binary packages.  <b>source</b>: Do a
           source-only build, no binary packages are made.

       --include-orig
           Forces the inclusion of the original source.

       --buildflags
           Set flags passed through to dpkg-buildpackage as semicolon-separated list.

       --results-dir
           Override the configured results directory and return artifacts at a custom location.

       --maintainer
           Set the name and email address of the maintainer for this package and upload, rather than using the
           information from the source tree's control file or changelog.

       --clean-source
           Run the d/rules clean target outside of the container. This means the package build dependencies need
           to be installed on the host system when building from a source directory.

       --lintian
           Run the Lintian static analysis tool for Debian packages after the package is built.

       --no-buildlog
           Do not write a build log.

       -i|--interact
           Run an interactive shell in the build environment after build. This implies `--no-buildlog` and
           disables the log.

       -e|--setenv
           Set an environment variable for the build process. Takes a `key=value` pair any may be defined
           multiple times to set different environment variables.

</pre><h4><b>DIFFERENCES</b> <b>TO</b> <b>SBUILD</b></h4><pre>
       On Debian, <b>sbuild</b> is the primary tool used for package building, which uses different technology. So
       naturally, the question is whether the sbuild build environments and the <b>debspawn</b> build environments are
       be identical or at least compatible.

       Due to the different technology used, there may be subtle differences between <b>sbuild</b> chroots and <b>debspawn</b>
       containers. The differences should not have any impact on package builds, and any such occurrence is
       highly likely a bug in the package's build process. If you think it is not, please file a bug against
       Debspawn. We try to be as close to sbuild's default environment as possible, but unfortunately can not
       make any guarantees.

       One way the build environment of <b>debspawn</b> differs from Debian's default <b>sbuild</b> setup intentionally is in
       its consistent use of unicode. By default, <b>debspawn</b> will ensure that unicode is always available and
       enabled. If you do not want this behavior, you can pass the <b>--no-unicode</b> flag to <b>debspawn</b> <b>build</b> to
       disable unicode in the tool itself and in the build environment.
