</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       which-pkg-broke-build - find which package might have broken another package's build

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>which-pkg-broke-build</b> [.]
       <b>which-pkg-broke-build</b> <u>&lt;source-directory&gt;</u>
       <b>which-pkg-broke-build</b> <u>&lt;source-package&gt;</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>which-pkg-broke-build</b> program will retrieve a list of all (recursive) build-dependencies of the named
       package sorted by the time they were installed on the system (as determined from the mtime information of
       <b><a href="file:/var/lib/dpkg/info/">/var/lib/dpkg/info/</a>*.list</b> .

       This  tool  allows a package developer to obtain information that might correlate installation of package
       build-dependencies with a package build breakage in order to find which build-dependency update might  be
       responsible for the breakage.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       If  there's  a  parameter  and  it's an existing directory, <b>which-pkg-broke-build</b> assumes that this is an
       unpacked Debian source package and looks for its build-dependencies.

       If there's a parameter and it's not an existing directory,  <b>which-pkg-broke-build</b>  assumes  that  it's  a
       source package name and looks for that source package's build-dependencies.

       If  there's  no  parameter, <b>which-pkg-broke-build</b> assumes that the current directory contains an unpacked
       Debian source package and looks for its build-dependencies.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>which-pkg-broke-build</b> is horribly slow and inefficient as it calls <b>which-pkg-broke</b> once for each explicit
       build-dependency (and once  for  the  package  build-essential).  It  hence  checks  packages  which  are
       dependencies of multiple explicit build-dependencies also multiple times.
