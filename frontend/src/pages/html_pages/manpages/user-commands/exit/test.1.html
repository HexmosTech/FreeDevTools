</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       test - check file types and compare values

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>test</b> <u>EXPRESSION</u>
       <b>test</b>
       <b>[</b> <u>EXPRESSION</u> <b>]</b>
       <b>[</b> <b>]</b>
       <b>[</b> <u>OPTION</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Exit with the status determined by EXPRESSION.

       <b>--help</b> display this help and exit

       <b>--version</b>
              output version information and exit

       An  omitted  EXPRESSION  defaults to false.  Otherwise, EXPRESSION is true or false and sets exit status.
       It is one of:

       ( EXPRESSION )
              EXPRESSION is true

       ! EXPRESSION
              EXPRESSION is false

       EXPRESSION1 <b>-a</b> EXPRESSION2
              both EXPRESSION1 and EXPRESSION2 are true

       EXPRESSION1 <b>-o</b> EXPRESSION2
              either EXPRESSION1 or EXPRESSION2 is true

       <b>-n</b> STRING
              the length of STRING is nonzero

       STRING equivalent to <b>-n</b> STRING

       <b>-z</b> STRING
              the length of STRING is zero

       STRING1 = STRING2
              the strings are equal

       STRING1 != STRING2
              the strings are not equal

       INTEGER1 <b>-eq</b> INTEGER2
              INTEGER1 is equal to INTEGER2

       INTEGER1 <b>-ge</b> INTEGER2
              INTEGER1 is greater than or equal to INTEGER2

       INTEGER1 <b>-gt</b> INTEGER2
              INTEGER1 is greater than INTEGER2

       INTEGER1 <b>-le</b> INTEGER2
              INTEGER1 is less than or equal to INTEGER2

       INTEGER1 <b>-lt</b> INTEGER2
              INTEGER1 is less than INTEGER2

       INTEGER1 <b>-ne</b> INTEGER2
              INTEGER1 is not equal to INTEGER2

       FILE1 <b>-ef</b> FILE2
              FILE1 and FILE2 have the same device and inode numbers

       FILE1 <b>-nt</b> FILE2
              FILE1 is newer (modification date) than FILE2

       FILE1 <b>-ot</b> FILE2
              FILE1 is older than FILE2

       <b>-b</b> FILE
              FILE exists and is block special

       <b>-c</b> FILE
              FILE exists and is character special

       <b>-d</b> FILE
              FILE exists and is a directory

       <b>-e</b> FILE
              FILE exists

       <b>-f</b> FILE
              FILE exists and is a regular file

       <b>-g</b> FILE
              FILE exists and is set-group-ID

       <b>-G</b> FILE
              FILE exists and is owned by the effective group ID

       <b>-h</b> FILE
              FILE exists and is a symbolic link (same as <b>-L</b>)

       <b>-k</b> FILE
              FILE exists and has its sticky bit set

       <b>-L</b> FILE
              FILE exists and is a symbolic link (same as <b>-h</b>)

       <b>-N</b> FILE
              FILE exists and has been modified since it was last read

       <b>-O</b> FILE
              FILE exists and is owned by the effective user ID

       <b>-p</b> FILE
              FILE exists and is a named pipe

       <b>-r</b> FILE
              FILE exists and the user has read access

       <b>-s</b> FILE
              FILE exists and has a size greater than zero

       <b>-S</b> FILE
              FILE exists and is a socket

       <b>-t</b> FD  file descriptor FD is opened on a terminal

       <b>-u</b> FILE
              FILE exists and its set-user-ID bit is set

       <b>-w</b> FILE
              FILE exists and the user has write access

       <b>-x</b> FILE
              FILE exists and the user has execute (or search) access

       Except for <b>-h</b> and <b>-L</b>, all FILE-related tests dereference symbolic links.  Beware that parentheses need to
       be escaped (e.g., by backslashes) for shells.  INTEGER may also be <b>-l</b>  STRING,  which  evaluates  to  the
       length of STRING.

       Binary <b>-a</b> and <b>-o</b> are ambiguous.  Use 'test EXPR1 &amp;&amp; test EXPR2' or 'test EXPR1 || test EXPR2' instead.

       '[' honors <b>--help</b> and <b>--version</b>, but 'test' treats them as STRINGs.

       Your  shell  may  have  its  own version of test and/or [, which usually supersedes the version described
       here.  Please refer to your shell's documentation for details about the options it supports.
