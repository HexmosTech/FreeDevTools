</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       exit â€” cause the shell to exit

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       exit <b>[</b><u>n</u><b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>exit</u>  utility  shall  cause  the  shell to exit from its current execution environment with the exit
       status specified by the unsigned decimal integer <u>n</u>.  If the current execution environment is  a  subshell
       environment,  the  shell  shall  exit  from  the  subshell environment with the specified exit status and
       continue in the environment from which that  subshell  environment  was  invoked;  otherwise,  the  shell
       utility shall terminate with the specified exit status. If <u>n</u> is specified, but its value is not between 0
       and 255 inclusively, the exit status is undefined.

       A  <u>trap</u> on <b>EXIT</b> shall be executed before the shell terminates, except when the <u>exit</u> utility is invoked in
       that <u>trap</u> itself, in which case the shell shall exit immediately.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       See the DESCRIPTION.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The exit status shall be <u>n</u>, if specified, except that the behavior is unspecified if <u>n</u> is not an unsigned
       decimal integer or is greater than 255. Otherwise, the value shall be the exit value of the last  command
       executed, or zero if no command was executed. When <u>exit</u> is executed in a <u>trap</u> action, the last command is
       considered to be the command that executed immediately preceding the <u>trap</u> action.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Exit with a <u>true</u> value:

           exit 0

       Exit with a <u>false</u> value:

           exit 1

       Propagate error handling from within a subshell:

           (
               command1 || exit 1
               command2 || exit 1
               exec command3
           ) &gt; outputfile || exit 1
           echo "outputfile created successfully"

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       As explained in other sections, certain exit status values have been reserved for special uses and should
       be used by applications only for those purposes:

        126    A file to be executed was found, but it was not an executable utility.

        127    A utility to be executed was not found.

       &gt;128    A command was interrupted by a signal.

       The  behavior  of  <u>exit</u>  when  given  an  invalid  argument  or unknown option is unspecified, because of
       differing practices in the various historical implementations. A value larger than 255 might be truncated
       by the shell, and be unavailable even to a parent process that uses <u>waitid</u>() to get the full exit  value.
       It  is  recommended  that implementations that detect any usage error should cause a non-zero exit status
       (or, if the shell is interactive and the error does not cause the shell to abort, store a non-zero  value
       in <b>"$?"</b>), but even this was not done historically in all shells.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
