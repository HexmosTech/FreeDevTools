</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cback3-span - Span staged data among multiple discs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cback3-span</b> [<u>switches</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  is  the  Cedar Backup 3 span tool.  It is intended for use by people who back up more data than can
       fit on a single disc.  It allows a user to split (span) staged data between more than one disc.  It can't
       be a Cedar Backup extension in the usual sense because it requires user input when switching media.

       Generally, one can run the cback3-span command with no arguments.  This will start it using  the  default
       configuration  file,  the default log file, etc.  You only need to use the switches if you need to change
       the default behavior.

       This command takes most of its configuration from the Cedar Backup configuration file,  specifically  the
       store  section.   Then,  more  information  is  gathered from the user interactively while the command is
       running.

</pre><h4><b>MIGRATING</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>2</b> <b>TO</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>3</b></h4><pre>
       The main difference between Cedar Backup version 2 and Cedar Backup version  3  is  the  targeted  Python
       interpreter.  For most users, migration should be straightforward.  See the discussion found at <a href="../man1/cback3.1.html">cback3</a>(1)
       or reference the Cedar Backup user guide.

</pre><h4><b>SWITCHES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Display usage/help listing.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Display version information.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Print  verbose  output  to the screen as well writing to the logfile. When this option is enabled,
              most information that would normally be written to the logfile will also be written to the screen.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--config</b>
              Specify the  path  to  an  alternate  configuration  file.   The  default  configuration  file  is
              <u>/etc/cback3.conf</u>.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--logfile</b>
              Specify the path to an alternate logfile.  The default logfile file is <u>/var/log/cback3.log</u>.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--owner</b>
              Specify  the ownership of the logfile, in the form user:group.  The default ownership is <u>root:adm</u>,
              to match the Debian standard for most logfiles.  This value will only be used when creating a  new
              logfile.   If  the  logfile  already exists when the cback3 script is executed, it will retain its
              existing ownership and mode.  Only user and group names may be  used,  not  numeric  uid  and  gid
              values.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--mode</b>
              Specify  the permissions for the logfile, using the numeric mode as in <a href="../man1/chmod.1.html">chmod</a>(1).  The default mode
              is <u>640</u> (-rw-r-----).  This value will only be used when creating a new logfile.   If  the  logfile
              already exists when the cback3 script is executed, it will retain its existing ownership and mode.

       <b>-O</b>, <b>--output</b>
              Record some sub-command output to the logfile. When this option is enabled, all output from system
              commands will be logged. This might be useful for debugging or just for reference.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--debug</b>
              Write  debugging  information  to  the  logfile. This option produces a high volume of output, and
              would generally only be needed when debugging a problem. This option implies the --output  option,
              as well.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--stack</b>
              Dump  a Python stack trace instead of swallowing exceptions.  This forces Cedar Backup to dump the
              entire Python stack trace associated with an error, rather than just propagating last  message  it
              received  back  up to the user interface.  Under some circumstances, this is useful information to
              include along with a bug report.

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--diagnostics</b>
              Display runtime diagnostic information and then exit.  This diagnostic information is often useful
              when filing a bug report.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       This command returns 0 (zero) upon normal completion, and six other error  codes  related  to  particular
       errors.

       <b>1</b>      The Python interpreter version is not supported.

       <b>2</b>      Error processing command-line arguments.

       <b>3</b>      Error configuring logging.

       <b>4</b>      Error parsing indicated configuration file.

       <b>5</b>      Backup was interrupted with a CTRL-C or similar.

       <b>6</b>      Other error during processing.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Cedar  Backup  itself  is  designed  to  run  as  root,  since otherwise it's difficult to back up system
       directories or write the CD or DVD device.  However, cback3-span can be run safely as any user  that  has
       read access to the Cedar Backup staging directories and write access to the CD or DVD device.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/cback3.conf</u> - Default configuration file

       <u>/var/log/cback3.log</u> - Default log file

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       If you find a bug, please report it.

       If  possible,  give  me  the output from --diagnostics, all of the error messages that the script printed
       into its log, and also any stack-traces (exceptions) that Python printed.  It would be even better if you
       could tell me how to reproduce the problem, for instance by sending me your configuration file.

       Report bugs to &lt;<a href="mailto:support@cedar-solutions.com">support@cedar-solutions.com</a>&gt; or via GitHub issues tracker.
