</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This command primarily creates and processes certificate requests (CSRs) in PKCS#10 format. It can
       additionally create self-signed certificates for use as root CAs for example.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-help</b>
           Print out a usage message.

       <b>-inform</b> <b>DER</b>|<b>PEM</b>
           The  CSR  input file format to use; by default PEM is tried first.  See <b><a href="../man1/openssl-format-options.1.html">openssl-format-options</a></b>(1) for
           details.

       <b>-outform</b> <b>DER</b>|<b>PEM</b>
           The output format; unspecified by default.  See <b><a href="../man1/openssl-format-options.1.html">openssl-format-options</a></b>(1) for details.

           The data is a PKCS#10 object.

       <b>-in</b> <u>filename</u>
           This specifies the input filename to read a request from.  This defaults  to  standard  input  unless
           <b>-x509</b>  or  <b>-CA</b>  is  specified.   A  request  is only read if the creation options (<b>-new</b> or <b>-newkey</b> or
           <b>-precert</b>) are not specified.

       <b>-sigopt</b> <u>nm</u>:<u>v</u>
           Pass options to the signature algorithm during sign operations.  Names and values  of  these  options
           are algorithm-specific.

       <b>-vfyopt</b> <u>nm</u>:<u>v</u>
           Pass  options to the signature algorithm during verify operations.  Names and values of these options
           are algorithm-specific.

       <b>-passin</b> <u>arg</u>
           The password source for private key and certificate input.  For more information about the format  of
           <b>arg</b> see <b><a href="../man1/openssl-passphrase-options.1.html">openssl-passphrase-options</a></b>(1).

       <b>-passout</b> <u>arg</u>
           The  password  source  for  the  output  file.   For  more  information  about  the format of <b>arg</b> see
           <b><a href="../man1/openssl-passphrase-options.1.html">openssl-passphrase-options</a></b>(1).

       <b>-out</b> <u>filename</u>
           This specifies the output filename to write to or standard output by default.

       <b>-text</b>
           Prints out the certificate request in text form.

       <b>-subject</b>
           Prints out the certificate request subject (or certificate subject if <b>-x509</b> is in use).

       <b>-pubkey</b>
           Prints out the public key.

       <b>-noout</b>
           This option prevents output of the encoded version of the certificate request.

       <b>-modulus</b>
           Prints out the value of the modulus of the public key contained in the request.

       <b>-verify</b>
           Verifies the self-signature on the request. If the verification fails, the program  will  immediately
           exit, i.e. further option processing (e.g. <b>-text</b>) is skipped.

       <b>-new</b>
           This  option  generates  a  new  certificate  request. It will prompt the user for the relevant field
           values. The actual fields prompted for and their maximum and  minimum  sizes  are  specified  in  the
           configuration file and any requested extensions.

           If the <b>-key</b> option is not given it will generate a new private key using information specified in the
           configuration  file  or  given with the <b>-newkey</b> and <b>-pkeyopt</b> options, else by default an RSA key with
           2048 bits length.

       <b>-newkey</b> <u>arg</u>
           This option is used to generate a new private key unless <b>-key</b> is given.  It is subsequently  used  as
           if it was given using the <b>-key</b> option.

           This  option  implies  the <b>-new</b> flag to create a new certificate request or a new certificate in case
           <b>-x509</b> is used.

           The argument takes one of several forms.

           [<b>rsa:</b>]<u>nbits</u> generates an RSA key <u>nbits</u> in size.  If <u>nbits</u> is omitted, i.e., <b>-newkey</b> <b>rsa</b> is specified,
           the default key size specified in the configuration file with the  <b>default_bits</b>  option  is  used  if
           present, else 2048.

           All  other  algorithms  support  the  <b>-newkey</b> <u>algname</u>:<u>file</u> form, where <u>file</u> is an algorithm parameter
           file, created with "openssl genpkey -genparam" or an X.509 certificate for  a  key  with  appropriate
           algorithm.

           <b>param:</b><u>file</u>  generates a key using the parameter file or certificate <u>file</u>, the algorithm is determined
           by the parameters.

           <u>algname</u>[:<u>file</u>] generates a key using the given algorithm <u>algname</u>.  If a parameter file <u>file</u> is  given
           then  the parameters specified there are used, where the algorithm parameters must match <u>algname</u>.  If
           algorithm parameters are not given, any necessary parameters should be  specified  via  the  <b>-pkeyopt</b>
           option.

           <b>dsa:</b><u>filename</u>  generates a DSA key using the parameters in the file <u>filename</u>. <b>ec:</b><u>filename</u> generates EC
           key (usable both with ECDSA or ECDH algorithms), <b>gost2001:</b><u>filename</u> generates GOST  R  34.10-2001  key
           (requires  <b>gost</b>  engine  configured  in  the  configuration  file).  If  just <b>gost2001</b> is specified a
           parameter set should be specified by <b>-pkeyopt</b> <u>paramset:X</u>

       <b>-pkeyopt</b> <u>opt</u>:<u>value</u>
           Set the public key algorithm option <u>opt</u> to <u>value</u>. The precise set of options supported depends on the
           public key algorithm used and its implementation.  See "KEY GENERATION OPTIONS" in <b><a href="../man1/openssl-genpkey.1.html">openssl-genpkey</a></b>(1)
           for more details.

       <b>-key</b> <u>filename</u>|<u>uri</u>
           This option provides the private key for signing a new certificate or  certificate  request.   Unless
           <b>-in</b>  is  given, the corresponding public key is placed in the new certificate or certificate request,
           resulting in a self-signature.

           For certificate signing this option is overridden by the <b>-CA</b> option.

           This option also accepts PKCS#8 format private keys for PEM format files.

       <b>-keyform</b> <b>DER</b>|<b>PEM</b>|<b>P12</b>|<b>ENGINE</b>
           The format of the private key; unspecified by default.  See <b><a href="../man1/openssl-format-options.1.html">openssl-format-options</a></b>(1) for details.

       <b>-keyout</b> <u>filename</u>
           This gives the filename to write any private key to that has been newly created or  read  from  <b>-key</b>.
           If  neither  the  <b>-keyout</b>  option  nor  the  <b>-key</b> option are given then the filename specified in the
           configuration file with the <b>default_keyfile</b> option is used, if present.  Thus, if you want  to  write
           the  private  key  and the <b>-key</b> option is provided, you should provide the <b>-keyout</b> option explicitly.
           If a new key is generated and no filename is specified the key is written to standard output.

       <b>-noenc</b>
           If this option is specified then if a private key is created it will not be encrypted.

       <b>-nodes</b>
           This option is deprecated since OpenSSL 3.0; use <b>-noenc</b> instead.

       <b>-</b><u><b>digest</b></u>
           This specifies the message digest to sign the request.  Any digest  supported  by  the  OpenSSL  <b>dgst</b>
           command can be used.  This overrides the digest algorithm specified in the configuration file.

           Some  public  key  algorithms may override this choice. For instance, DSA signatures always use SHA1,
           GOST R 34.10 signatures always use GOST R 34.11-94 (<b>-md_gost94</b>), Ed25519  and  Ed448  never  use  any
           digest.

       <b>-config</b> <u>filename</u>
           This  allows  an  alternative configuration file to be specified.  Optional; for a description of the
           default value, see "COMMAND SUMMARY" in <b><a href="../man1/openssl.1.html">openssl</a></b>(1).

       <b>-section</b> <u>name</u>
           Specifies the name of the section to use; the default is <b>req</b>.

       <b>-subj</b> <u>arg</u>
           Sets subject name for new request or supersedes  the  subject  name  when  processing  a  certificate
           request.

           The  arg  must  be  formatted  as  "/type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=...".  Special characters may be
           escaped  by  "\"  (backslash),  whitespace  is  retained.   Empty  values  are  permitted,  but   the
           corresponding  type  will  not be included in the request.  Giving a single "/" will lead to an empty
           sequence of RDNs (a NULL-DN).  Multi-valued RDNs can be formed by placing a "+" character instead  of
           a "/" between the AttributeValueAssertions (AVAs) that specify the members of the set.  Example:

           "/DC=org/DC=OpenSSL/DC=users/UID=123456+CN=John Doe"

       <b>-multivalue-rdn</b>
           This option has been deprecated and has no effect.

       <b>-x509</b>
           This  option  outputs  a  certificate  instead  of  a certificate request.  This is typically used to
           generate test certificates.  It is implied by the <b>-CA</b> option.

           This option implies the <b>-new</b> flag if <b>-in</b> is not given.

           If an existing request is specified with the <b>-in</b> option, it is converted to a certificate;  otherwise
           a request is created from scratch.

           Unless  specified  using  the  <b>-set_serial</b>  option, a large random number will be used for the serial
           number.

           Unless the <b>-copy_extensions</b> option is used, X.509 extensions are not copied from any provided request
           input file.

           X.509 extensions to be added can be specified in the configuration file, possibly using  the  <b>-config</b>
           and <b>-extensions</b> options, and/or using the <b>-addext</b> option.

           Unless  <b>-x509v1</b>  is  given, generated certificates bear X.509 version 3.  Unless specified otherwise,
           key identifier extensions are included as described in <b><a href="../man5/x509v3_config.5.html">x509v3_config</a></b>(5).

       <b>-x509v1</b>
           Request generation of certificates with X.509 version 1.  This implies <b>-x509</b>.   If  X.509  extensions
           are given, anyway X.509 version 3 is set.

       <b>-CA</b> <u>filename</u>|<u>uri</u>
           Specifies  the  "CA"  certificate  to be used for signing a new certificate and implies use of <b>-x509</b>.
           When present, this behaves like a "micro CA" as follows: The subject name of the "CA" certificate  is
           placed  as  issuer  name  in  the  new  certificate, which is then signed using the "CA" key given as
           specified below.

       <b>-CAkey</b> <u>filename</u>|<u>uri</u>
           Sets the "CA" private key to sign a certificate with.  The private key must match the public  key  of
           the  certificate  given with <b>-CA</b>.  If this option is not provided then the key must be present in the
           <b>-CA</b> input.

       <b>-not_before</b> <u>date</u>
           When <b>-x509</b> is in use this allows the start date to be explicitly set, otherwise it  is  ignored.  The
           format of <u>date</u> is YYMMDDHHMMSSZ (the same as an ASN1 UTCTime structure), or YYYYMMDDHHMMSSZ (the same
           as  an  ASN1  GeneralizedTime structure). In both formats, seconds SS and timezone Z must be present.
           Alternatively, you can also use "today".

       <b>-not_after</b> <u>date</u>
           When <b>-x509</b> is in use this allows the expiry date to be explicitly set, otherwise it is  ignored.  The
           format of <u>date</u> is YYMMDDHHMMSSZ (the same as an ASN1 UTCTime structure), or YYYYMMDDHHMMSSZ (the same
           as  an  ASN1  GeneralizedTime structure). In both formats, seconds SS and timezone Z must be present.
           Alternatively, you can also use "today".

           This overrides the <b>-days</b> option.

       <b>-days</b> <u>n</u>
           When <b>-x509</b> is in use this specifies the number of days from today to  certify  the  certificate  for,
           otherwise it is ignored. <u>n</u> should be a positive integer. The default is 30 days.

           Regardless  of  the  option  <b>-not_before</b>, the days are always counted from today.  When used together
           with the option <b>-not_after</b>, the explicit expiry date takes precedence.

       <b>-set_serial</b> <u>n</u>
           Serial number to use when outputting a self-signed certificate.  This may be specified as  a  decimal
           value or a hex value if preceded by "0x".  If not given, a large random number will be used.

       <b>-copy_extensions</b> <u>arg</u>
           Determines  how  X.509 extensions in certificate requests should be handled when <b>-x509</b> is in use.  If
           <u>arg</u> is <b>none</b> or this option is not present then extensions are ignored.  If <u>arg</u>  is  <b>copy</b>  or  <b>copyall</b>
           then all extensions in the request are copied to the certificate.

           The main use of this option is to allow a certificate request to supply values for certain extensions
           such as subjectAltName.

       <b>-extensions</b> <u>section</u>, <b>-reqexts</b> <u>section</u>
           Can  be  used  to override the name of the configuration file section from which X.509 extensions are
           included in the certificate (when <b>-x509</b> is in use)  or  certificate  request.   This  allows  several
           different  sections  to  be  used in the same configuration file to specify requests for a variety of
           purposes.

       <b>-addext</b> <u>ext</u>
           Add a specific extension to the certificate (if  <b>-x509</b>  is  in  use)  or  certificate  request.   The
           argument must have the form of a "key=value" pair as it would appear in a config file.

           If  an  extension  is  added  using this option that has the same OID as one defined in the extension
           section of the config file, it overrides that one.

           This option can be given multiple times.  Doing so, the same key most not be given more than once.

       <b>-precert</b>
           A poison extension will be added to the certificate, making it  a  "pre-certificate"  (see  RFC6962).
           This  can  be  submitted  to  Certificate  Transparency  logs  in  order to obtain signed certificate
           timestamps (SCTs).  These SCTs can then be embedded into the pre-certificate as an extension,  before
           removing the poison and signing the certificate.

           This implies the <b>-new</b> flag.

       <b>-utf8</b>
           This option causes field values to be interpreted as UTF8 strings, by default they are interpreted as
           ASCII.  This  means  that  the  field  values,  whether  prompted  from a terminal or obtained from a
           configuration file, must be valid UTF8 strings.

       <b>-reqopt</b> <u>option</u>
           Customise the printing format used with <b>-text</b>. The <u>option</u> argument can be a single option or multiple
           options separated by commas.

           See discussion of the  <b>-certopt</b> parameter in the <b><a href="../man1/openssl-x509.1.html">openssl-x509</a></b>(1) command.

       <b>-newhdr</b>
           Adds the word <b>NEW</b> to the PEM file header and footer lines on the  outputted  request.  Some  software
           (Netscape certificate server) and some CAs need this.

       <b>-batch</b>
           Non-interactive mode.

       <b>-verbose</b>
           Print extra details about the operations being performed.

       <b>-quiet</b>
           Print  fewer details about the operations being performed, which may be handy during batch scripts or
           pipelines (specifically "progress dots" during key generation are suppressed).

       <b>-keygen_engine</b> <u>id</u>
           Specifies an engine (by its unique <u>id</u> string) which would be used for key generation operations.

       <b>-nameopt</b> <u>option</u>
           This specifies how the subject or issuer names are displayed.  See <b><a href="../man1/openssl-namedisplay-options.1.html">openssl-namedisplay-options</a></b>(1) for
           details.

       <b>-rand</b> <u>files</u>, <b>-writerand</b> <u>file</u>
           See "Random State Options" in <b><a href="../man1/openssl.1.html">openssl</a></b>(1) for details.

       <b>-engine</b> <u>id</u>
           See "Engine Options" in <b><a href="../man1/openssl.1.html">openssl</a></b>(1).  This option is deprecated.

       <b>-provider</b> <u>name</u>
       <b>-provider-path</b> <u>path</u>
       <b>-propquery</b> <u>propq</u>
           See "Provider Options" in <b><a href="../man1/openssl.1.html">openssl</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man7/provider.7.html">provider</a></b>(7), and <b><a href="../man7/property.7.html">property</a></b>(7).

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The configuration options are specified in the <b>req</b> section of the configuration file. An  alternate  name
       be  specified by using the <b>-section</b> option.  As with all configuration files, if no value is specified in
       the specific section then the initial unnamed or <b>default</b> section is searched too.

       The options available are described in detail below.

       <b>input_password</b>, <b>output_password</b>
           The passwords for the input private key file (if present) and the output private  key  file  (if  one
           will be created). The command line options <b>passin</b> and <b>passout</b> override the configuration file values.

       <b>default_bits</b>
           Specifies the default key size in bits.

           This  option  is used in conjunction with the <b>-new</b> option to generate a new key. It can be overridden
           by specifying an explicit key size in the <b>-newkey</b> option. The smallest accepted key size is 512 bits.
           If no key size is specified then 2048 bits is used.

       <b>default_keyfile</b>
           This is the default filename to write a private key to. If  not  specified  the  key  is  written  to
           standard output. This can be overridden by the <b>-keyout</b> option.

       <b>oid_file</b>
           This specifies a file containing additional <b>OBJECT</b> <b>IDENTIFIERS</b>.  Each line of the file should consist
           of the numerical form of the object identifier followed by whitespace then the short name followed by
           whitespace and finally the long name.

       <b>oid_section</b>
           This  specifies  a  section  in the configuration file containing extra object identifiers. Each line
           should consist of the short name of the object identifier followed by <b>=</b> and the numerical  form.  The
           short and long names are the same when this option is used.

       <b>RANDFILE</b>
           At  startup the specified file is loaded into the random number generator, and at exit 256 bytes will
           be written to it.  It is used for private key generation.

       <b>encrypt_key</b>
           If this is set to <b>no</b> then if a private key is generated it is <b>not</b> encrypted. This  is  equivalent  to
           the <b>-noenc</b> command line option. For compatibility <b>encrypt_rsa_key</b> is an equivalent option.

       <b>default_md</b>
           This  option  specifies the digest algorithm to use. Any digest supported by the OpenSSL <b>dgst</b> command
           can be used. This option can be overridden on the command  line.  Certain  signing  algorithms  (i.e.
           Ed25519 and Ed448) will ignore any digest that has been set.

       <b>string_mask</b>
           This  option masks out the use of certain string types in certain fields. Most users will not need to
           change this option. It can be set to several values:

           <b>utf8only</b> - only UTF8Strings are used (this is the default value)
           <b>pkix</b> - any string type except T61Strings
           <b>nombstr</b> - any string type except BMPStrings and UTF8Strings
           <b>default</b> - any kind of string type

           Note that <b>utf8only</b> is the PKIX recommendation in RFC2459 after 2003,  and  the  default  <b>string_mask</b>;
           <b>default</b>  is  not  the  default  option.  The <b>nombstr</b> value is a workaround for some software that has
           problems with variable-sized BMPStrings and UTF8Strings.

       <b>req_extensions</b>
           This specifies the configuration file  section  containing  a  list  of  extensions  to  add  to  the
           certificate  request.  It can be overridden by the <b>-reqexts</b> (or <b>-extensions</b>) command line switch. See
           the <b><a href="../man5/x509v3_config.5.html">x509v3_config</a></b>(5) manual page for details of the extension section format.

       <b>x509_extensions</b>
           This specifies the configuration file section containing a list of extensions to add  to  certificate
           generated when <b>-x509</b> is in use.  It can be overridden by the <b>-extensions</b> command line switch.

       <b>prompt</b>
           If  set  to the value <b>no</b> this disables prompting of certificate fields and just takes values from the
           config file directly. It also changes the expected format of the  <b>distinguished_name</b>  and  <b>attributes</b>
           sections.

       <b>utf8</b>
           If  set  to  the  value  <b>yes</b> then field values to be interpreted as UTF8 strings, by default they are
           interpreted as ASCII. This means that the field values, whether prompted from a terminal or  obtained
           from a configuration file, must be valid UTF8 strings.

       <b>attributes</b>
           This   specifies  the  section  containing  any  request  attributes:  its  format  is  the  same  as
           <b>distinguished_name</b>. Typically these may contain the challengePassword or unstructuredName types. They
           are currently ignored by OpenSSL's request signing utilities but some CAs might want them.

       <b>distinguished_name</b>
           This specifies the section containing the distinguished name fields to prompt for when  generating  a
           certificate or certificate request. The format is described in the next section.

</pre><h4><b>DISTINGUISHED</b> <b>NAME</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ATTRIBUTE</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       There are two separate formats for the distinguished name and attribute sections. If the <b>prompt</b> option is
       set to <b>no</b> then these sections just consist of field names and values: for example,

        CN=My Name
        OU=My Organization
        emailAddress=<a href="mailto:someone@somewhere.org">someone@somewhere.org</a>

       This  allows  external programs (e.g. GUI based) to generate a template file with all the field names and
       values and just pass it to this command. An example of this kind of configuration file  is  contained  in
       the <b>EXAMPLES</b> section.

       Alternatively  if  the  <b>prompt</b>  option  is absent or not set to <b>no</b> then the file contains field prompting
       information. It consists of lines of the form:

        fieldName="prompt"
        fieldName_default="default field value"
        fieldName_min= 2
        fieldName_max= 4

       "fieldName" is the field name being used, for example commonName (or CN).  The "prompt" string is used to
       ask the user to enter the relevant details. If the user enters nothing then the default value is used  if
       no default value is present then the field is omitted. A field can still be omitted if a default value is
       present if the user just enters the '.' character.

       The number of characters entered must be between the fieldName_min and fieldName_max limits: there may be
       additional  restrictions  based  on  the  field  being used (for example countryName can only ever be two
       characters long and must fit in a PrintableString).

       Some fields (such as organizationName) can be used more than once  in  a  DN.  This  presents  a  problem
       because  configuration  files  will not recognize the same name occurring twice. To avoid this problem if
       the fieldName contains some characters followed by a full stop they will be ignored.  So  for  example  a
       second organizationName can be input by calling it "1.organizationName".

       The  actual  permitted field names are any object identifier short or long names. These are compiled into
       OpenSSL and include the usual values such as  commonName,  countryName,  localityName,  organizationName,
       organizationalUnitName,  stateOrProvinceName.  Additionally  emailAddress  is  included  as well as name,
       surname, givenName, initials, and dnQualifier.

       Additional  object  identifiers  can  be  defined  with  the  <b>oid_file</b>  or  <b>oid_section</b>  options  in  the
       configuration file. Any additional fields will be treated as though they were a DirectoryString.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Examine and verify certificate request:

        openssl req -in req.pem -text -verify -noout

       Create a private key and then generate a certificate request from it:

        openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048
        openssl req -new -key key.pem -out req.pem

       The same but just using req:

        openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out req.pem

       Generate a self-signed root certificate:

        openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out req.pem

       Create an SM2 private key and then generate a certificate request from it:

        openssl ecparam -genkey -name SM2 -out sm2.key
        openssl req -new -key sm2.key -out sm2.csr -sm3 -sigopt "distid:1234567812345678"

       Examine and verify an SM2 certificate request:

        openssl req -verify -in sm2.csr -sm3 -vfyopt "distid:1234567812345678"

       Example of a file pointed to by the <b>oid_file</b> option:

        1.2.3.4        shortName       A longer Name
        1.2.3.6        otherName       Other longer Name

       Example of a section pointed to by <b>oid_section</b> making use of variable expansion:

        testoid1=1.2.3.5
        testoid2=${testoid1}.6

       Sample configuration file prompting for field values:

        [ req ]
        default_bits           = 2048
        default_keyfile        = privkey.pem
        distinguished_name     = req_distinguished_name
        attributes             = req_attributes
        req_extensions         = v3_ca

        dirstring_type = nombstr

        [ req_distinguished_name ]
        countryName                    = Country Name (2 letter code)
        countryName_default            = AU
        countryName_min                = 2
        countryName_max                = 2

        localityName                   = Locality Name (eg, city)

        organizationalUnitName         = Organizational Unit Name (eg, section)

        commonName                     = Common Name (eg, YOUR name)
        commonName_max                 = 64

        emailAddress                   = Email Address
        emailAddress_max               = 40

        [ req_attributes ]
        challengePassword              = A challenge password
        challengePassword_min          = 4
        challengePassword_max          = 20

        [ v3_ca ]

        subjectKeyIdentifier=hash
        authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid:always,issuer:always
        basicConstraints = critical, CA:true

       Sample configuration containing all field values:

        [ req ]
        default_bits           = 2048
        default_keyfile        = keyfile.pem
        distinguished_name     = req_distinguished_name
        attributes             = req_attributes
        prompt                 = no
        output_password        = mypass

        [ req_distinguished_name ]
        C                      = GB
        ST                     = Test State or Province
        L                      = Test Locality
        O                      = Organization Name
        OU                     = Organizational Unit Name
        CN                     = Common Name
        emailAddress           = <a href="mailto:test@email.address">test@email.address</a>

        [ req_attributes ]
        challengePassword              = A challenge password

       Example of giving the most common attributes (subject and extensions) on the command line:

        openssl req -new -subj "/C=GB/CN=foo" \
                         -addext "subjectAltName = DNS:foo.co.uk" \
                         -addext "certificatePolicies = 1.2.3.4" \
                         -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out req.pem

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The  certificate  requests generated by <b>Xenroll</b> with MSIE have extensions added. It includes the <b>keyUsage</b>
       extension which determines the type of key (signature only or general purpose) and  any  additional  OIDs
       entered by the script in an <b>extendedKeyUsage</b> extension.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       The following messages are frequently asked about:

               Using configuration from /some/path/openssl.cnf
               Unable to load config info

       This is followed some time later by:

               unable to find 'distinguished_name' in config
               problems making Certificate Request

       The  first  error  message  is  the  clue: it can't find the configuration file! Certain operations (like
       examining a certificate request) don't need a configuration file so its use isn't enforced. Generation of
       certificates or requests however does need a configuration file. This could be regarded as a bug.

       Another puzzling message is this:

               Attributes:
                   a0:00

       this is displayed when no attributes are present and the  request  includes  the  correct  empty  <b>SET</b>  <b>OF</b>
       structure (the DER encoding of which is 0xa0 0x00). If you just see:

               Attributes:

       then  the  <b>SET</b>  <b>OF</b>  is  missing  and  the  encoding is technically invalid (but it is tolerated). See the
       description of the command line option <b>-asn1-kludge</b> for more information.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       OpenSSL's handling of T61Strings (aka TeletexStrings) is broken: it effectively treats them as ISO-8859-1
       (Latin 1), Netscape and MSIE have similar behaviour.  This can cause problems if you need characters that
       aren't available in PrintableStrings and you don't want to or can't use BMPStrings.

       As a consequence of the T61String handling the only correct  way  to  represent  accented  characters  in
       OpenSSL  is  to  use  a  BMPString:  unfortunately Netscape currently chokes on these. If you have to use
       accented characters with Netscape and MSIE then you currently need to use the invalid T61String form.

       The current prompting is not very friendly. It doesn't allow you to confirm  what  you've  just  entered.
       Other  things  like  extensions in certificate requests are statically defined in the configuration file.
       Some of these: like an email address in subjectAltName should be input by the user.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>-section</b> option was added in OpenSSL 3.0.0.

       The <b>-multivalue-rdn</b> option has become obsolete in OpenSSL 3.0.0 and has no effect.

       The  <b>-engine</b>  option  was  deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0.  The &lt;-nodes&gt; option was deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0,
       too; use <b>-noenc</b> instead.

       The <b>-reqexts</b> option has been made an alias of <b>-extensions</b> in OpenSSL 3.2.

       Since OpenSSL 3.2, generated certificates  bear  X.509  version  3  unless  <b>-x509v1</b>  is  given,  and  key
       identifier extensions are included by default.

       Since OpenSSL 3.3, the <b>-verify</b> option will exit with 1 on failure.
