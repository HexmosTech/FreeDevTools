</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sq key rotate - Rotate a certificate

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sq</b> <b>key</b> <b>rotate</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Rotate a certificate.

       Generates a new certificate to replace an existing one.

       The new certificate will have the same capabilities as the old certificate.  This can be overridden using
       the `--can-sign`, `--cannot-sign`, etc., arguments.  Note: the new certificate may have a different shape
       from  the  old  certificate.   For  instance,  if  the  old  certificate's  primary key is marked as both
       certification and signing capable, the new certificate's primary key will be certification  capable,  and
       it will have a signing subkey.

       By default the certificate expires after 3 years.  This can be changed using the `--expiration` argument.

       The new certificate will have the same self-signed user IDs as the old certificate.  Revoked user IDs are
       ignored.

       The  new  certificate  and  the  old  certificate  will cross certify each other as unconstrained trusted
       introducers.

       The new certificate will be linked in the same way as the old certificate.  This can be overridden  using
       the `--own-key`, or the `--shared-key` argument.

       The  new  certificate  will  certify  the  same  certificates  as  the old certificate.  That is, the old
       certificate's certifications will be replayed.  See `sq pki vouch replay` for more information.

       A revocation certificate indicating that the old certificate is retired, and  that  the  new  certificate
       should  be  instead  used  will  be issued.  By default, it will go into effect in 182 days.  This can be
       changed or suppressed using the `--retire-in` argument.

       When using `--output`, the new certificate as well as all of the other updated certificates  are  written
       to the specified file.

       Stable since 1.2.0.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Subcommand</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>--can-authenticate</b>
              Add an authentication-capable subkey

       <b>--can-encrypt</b>=<u>PURPOSE</u>
              Add an encryption-capable subkey

              Encryption-capable subkeys can be marked as suitable for transport encryption, storage encryption,
              or both, i.e., universal.

              [possible values: <b>transport</b>, <b>storage</b>, <b>universal</b>]

       <b>--can-sign</b>
              Add a signing-capable subkey

       <b>--cannot-authenticate</b>
              Don't add an authentication-capable subkey

       <b>--cannot-encrypt</b>
              Don't add an encryption-capable subkey

       <b>--cannot-sign</b>
              Don't add a signing-capable subkey

       <b>--cert</b>=<u>FINGERPRINT|KEYID</u>
              Use certificates with the specified fingerprint or key ID

       <b>--cert-email</b>=<u>EMAIL</u>
              Use certificates where a user ID includes the specified email address

       <b>--cert-file</b>=<u>PATH</u>
              Read certificates from PATH

       <b>--cert-userid</b>=<u>USERID</u>
              Use certificates with the specified user ID

       <b>--cipher-suite</b>=<u>CIPHER-SUITE</u>
              Select the cryptographic algorithms for the key

              The    default    can    be    changed    in    the   configuration   file   using   the   setting
              `key.generate.cipher-suite`.

              [default: <b>cv25519</b>]

              [possible values: <b>rsa2k</b>, <b>rsa3k</b>, <b>rsa4k</b>, <b>cv25519</b>]

       <b>--expiration</b>=<u>EXPIRATION</u>
              Sets the expiration time

              EXPIRATION is either an ISO 8601 formatted date with an optional time or  a  custom  duration.   A
              duration  takes  the  form `N[ymwds]`, where the letters stand for years, months, weeks, days, and
              seconds, respectively. Alternatively, the keyword `never` does not set an expiration time.

              [default: <b>3y</b>]

       <b>--new-password-file</b>=<u>PASSWORD_FILE</u>
              File containing password to encrypt the secret key material

              Note that the entire key file will be used as the password including  any  surrounding  whitespace
              like a trailing newline.

       <b>--output</b>=<u>FILE</u>
              Write the key to the specified file

              When not specified, the key is saved on the key store.

       <b>--own-key</b>
              Mark the key as one's own key

              The  newly  generated  key with all of its user IDs will be marked as authenticated and as a fully
              trusted introducer.

       <b>--profile</b>=<u>PROFILE</u>
              Select the OpenPGP standard for the key

              As OpenPGP evolves, new versions will become  available.   This  option  selects  the  version  of
              OpenPGP to use for the newly generated key.

              Currently,  sq  supports  only one version: RFC4880.  Consequently, this is the default.  However,
              there is already a newer version of the standard: RFC9580.  And, the  default  will  change  in  a
              future version of sq.

              The default can be changed in the configuration file using the setting `key.generate.profile`.

              [default: <b>rfc4880</b>]

              [possible values: <b>rfc4880</b>]

       <b>--retire-in</b>=<u>TIME</u>
              Sets the time at which the certificate should be retired

              TIME  is either an ISO 8601 formatted date with an optional time or a custom duration.  A duration
              takes the form `N[ymwds]`, where the letters stand for years, months, weeks,  days,  and  seconds,
              respectively.  Alternatively,  the  keyword  `never`  skips  the  certification  of  a  revocation
              certificate.

              [default: <b>26w</b>]

       <b>--rev-cert</b>=<u>FILE</u>
              Write the emergency revocation certificate to FILE

              When  the  key  is  stored  on  the  key  store,  the  revocation   certificate   is   stored   in
              $HOME/.local/share/sequoia/revocation-certificates by default.

              When  `--output`  is  specified,  the  revocation  certificate is written to the file specified by
              `--rev-cert`.

              If `--output` is `-`, then this option must not also be `-`.

       <b>--shared-key</b>
              Mark the key as a shared key

              The newly generated key with all of its user IDs will be marked as authenticated,  but  not  as  a
              trusted introducer.  Further, the key metadata will indicate that this is a shared key.

              Use  this  option  if you plan to share this key with other people.  Normally, you shouldn't share
              keys material.  An example of where you might want to do this is a shared mailbox.

       <b>--without-password</b>
              Don't protect the secret key material with a password
