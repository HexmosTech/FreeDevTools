       sq pki vouch - Manage certifications

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sq</b> <b>pki</b> <b>vouch</b> <b>add</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>]
       <b>sq</b> <b>pki</b> <b>vouch</b> <b>authorize</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>]
       <b>sq</b> <b>pki</b> <b>vouch</b> <b>list</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Manage certifications.

       A vouch is a potentially public statement that something is true.  In OpenPGP there are two main types of
       statements that you can make: certifications, and authorizations.

       You  can  assert  that  a certificate belongs to a particular entity. This says nothing about an entity's
       trustworthiness.  For instance, you might certify `<a href="mailto:bob@nsa.gov">bob@nsa.gov</a>` for a given certificate.  This just means
       that you think the person behind the  email  address  `<a href="mailto:bob@nsa.gov">bob@nsa.gov</a>`  really  controls  that  certificate.
       That's a useful statement to make even if you don't trust that person to act in your interest.

       Alternatively  you  can say that you believe a certificate is a reasonable trusted introducer.  A trusted
       introducer is a third-party that you authorize to make introductions.  For instance, your bank might have
       a certification authority (CA).  If you verify the  CA's  fingerprint,  you  can  authorize  it  to  make
       certifications.   That  means  that  sq will use those certifications almost as if you made them. This is
       convenient as now you can authenticate any of the bank's employee.

       Authorizing a trusted introducer gives the trusted introducer a lot of  power.   You  can  constrain  the
       amount  of  power  that you give it by saying that it is only authorized to certify user IDs that have an
       email address in one or more domains, for instance.  In this way, you can take advantage  of  the  places
       where  your  and  a  CA's interests are aligned, and protect yourself from potentially malicious actions.
       For example, you could authorize your bank's CA to certify  user  IDs  that  have  an  email  address  in
       `bank.com`.  sq will then ignore any other certifications made by the CA.

</pre><h4><b>SUBCOMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>sq</b> <b>pki</b> <b>vouch</b> <b>add</b>
       Certify a User ID for a Certificate.

       Using a certification a keyholder may vouch for the fact that another certificate legitimately belongs to
       a  user  id.   In  the  context  of emails this means that the same entity controls the key and the email
       address.  These kind of certifications form the basis for the Web of Trust.

       This command emits the certificate with the  new  certification.   The  updated  certificate  has  to  be
       distributed,  preferably  by  sending  it  to  the  certificate  holder  for  approval.  See also `sq key
       approvals`.

       By default a certification expires after 10 years. Using the `--expiration`  argument  specific  validity
       periods  may  be  defined.  It  allows  for  providing  a point in time for validity to end or a validity
       duration.

       `sq pki vouch add` respects the reference time set by the  top-level  `--time`  argument.   It  sets  the
       certification's creation time to the reference time.

   <b>sq</b> <b>pki</b> <b>vouch</b> <b>authorize</b>
       Mark a certificate as a trusted introducer.

       Creates  a  certification that says that the issuer considers the certificate to be a trusted introducer.
       Trusted introducer is another word for certification authority (CA).  When a user  relies  on  a  trusted
       introducer,  the  user  considers  certifications  made by the trusted introducer to be valid.  A trusted
       introducer can also designate further trusted introducers.

       As is, a trusted introducer has a lot of power.  This power can be limited in several ways.

         - The ability to specify further introducers can be constrained using the `--depth` parameter.

         - The degree to which an introducer is trusted can be changed using the `--amount` parameter.

         - The user IDs that an introducer can certify  can  be  constrained  by  domain  using  the  `--domain`
       parameter or a regular expression using the `--regex` parameter.

       These  mechanisms  allow Alice to say that she is willing to rely on the CA for example.org, but only for
       user IDs that have an email address for example.org, for instance.

       By default a delegation expires after 10 years. Use the `--expiration` argument to override this.

       This subcommand respects the reference time  set  by  the  top-level  `--time`  argument.   It  sets  the
       certification's creation time to the reference time.

   <b>sq</b> <b>pki</b> <b>vouch</b> <b>list</b>
       List certifications.

       If  the  certifier argument is provided, then certifications made by the specified certificate are shown.
       If the certificate argument is provided, then certifications of the specified certificate are  shown.  If
       both  are  provided, then certifications of the specified certificate made by the specified certifier are
       shown.

       This command lists all of certifications, not just the active certification.

       Because certifications  are  associated  with  the  certificated  certificate  and  not  the  certifier's
       certificate, this list is likely incomplete.

       Stable since 1.2.0.

   <b>sq</b> <b>pki</b> <b>vouch</b> <b>replay</b>
       Replays vouches.

       This  command  replays  the vouches made by one certificate using another certificate.  This is primarily
       useful when you replace a  certificate,  and  you  want  the  new  certificate  to  have  made  the  same
       certifications as you made with the old certificate.

       Because  certifications  are  associated  with  the  certificated  certificate,  and  not the certifier's
       certificate, this may not replay all of the certifications that the source ever made.

       This command only copies the active certification for a given user ID  and  certificate.   This  includes
       both  exportable  certifications (vouches) as well as non-exportable certifications (links).  It excludes
       expired certifications.  It also doesn't replay  certifications  made  on  invalid,  expired  or  revoked
       certificates, or revoked user IDs.

       This command replays all of the certifications parameters including any expiration time, but the creation
       time is set to the current time.

       Stable since 1.2.0.
