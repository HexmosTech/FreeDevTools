</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       git-annex-fsck - find and fix problems

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       git annex fsck <b>[path</b> <b>...]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This command checks annexed files for consistency, and warns about or fixes any problems found. This is a
       good complement to <b>git</b> <b>fsck</b>.

       The  default  is to check all annexed files in the current directory and subdirectories. With parameters,
       only the specified files are checked.

       The problems fsck finds include files that have gotten corrupted, files whose content has somehow  become
       lost, files that do not have the configured number of copies yet made, and keys that can be upgraded to a
       better format.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--from=remote</b>

              Check a remote, rather than the local repository.

              Note  that by default, files will be copied from the remote to check their contents. To avoid this
              expensive transfer, and only verify that the remote still has the files that are expected to be on
              it, add the <b>--fast</b> option.

       <b>--fast</b> Avoids expensive checksum calculations (and expensive transfers when fscking a remote).

       <b>--incremental</b>
              Start a new incremental fsck pass. An incremental fsck can be interrupted at  any  time,  with  eg
              ctrl-c.

       <b>--more</b> Resume the last incremental fsck pass, where it left off.

              Resuming  may  redundantly  check  some  files that were checked before. Any files that fsck found
              problems with before will be re-checked on resume. Also, checkpoints are made every 1000 files  or
              every 5 minutes during a fsck, and it resumes from the last checkpoint.

       <b>--incremental-schedule=time</b>
              This  makes  a  new  incremental  fsck  be  started  only  a  specified time period after the last
              incremental fsck was started.

              The time is in the form "10d" or "300h".

              Maybe you'd like to run a fsck for 5 hours at night, picking up each  night  where  it  left  off.
              You'd like this to continue until all files have been fscked. And once it's done, you'd like a new
              fsck pass to start, but no more often than once a month. Then put this in a nightly cron job:

               git annex fsck --incremental-schedule 30d --time-limit 5h

       <b>--numcopies=N</b>
              Override the normally configured number of copies.

              To verify data integrity only while disregarding required number of copies, use <b>--numcopies=1</b>.

       <b>--all</b> <b>-A</b>
              Normally  only  the  files  in the currently checked out branch are fscked. This option causes all
              versions of all files to be fscked.

              This is the default behavior when running git-annex in a bare repository.

       <b>--branch=ref</b>
              Operate on files in the specified branch or treeish.

       <b>--unused</b>
              Operate on files found by last run of git-annex unused.

       <b>--key=keyname</b>
              Use this option to fsck a specified key.

       matching options
              The <a href="../man1/git-annex-matching-options.1.html">git-annex-matching-options</a>(1) can be used to control what to fsck.

       <b>--jobs=N</b> <b>-JN</b>
              Runs multiple fsck jobs in parallel. For example: <b>-J4</b>

              Setting this to "cpus" will run one job per CPU core.

       <b>--json</b> Enable JSON output. This is intended to be parsed by programs that use  git-annex.  Each  line  of
              output is a JSON object.

       <b>--json-error-messages</b>
              Messages that would normally be output to standard error are included in the JSON instead.

       <b>--quiet</b>
              Like  all git-annex commands, this option makes only error and warning messages be displayed. This
              is particularly useful with fsck, which normally displays all the files it's  checking  even  when
              there is no problem with them.

       Also the <a href="../man1/git-annex-common-options.1.html">git-annex-common-options</a>(1) can be used.
