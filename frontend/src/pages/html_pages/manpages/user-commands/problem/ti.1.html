</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ti — issue tracking system built on Git

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ti</b> <u>COMMAND</u> [<u>ARGUMENTS</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ti</b>,  short  for  ticgit,  is an issue tracker based on the Git revision control system.  It allows you to
       store bugs in your project in a separate <b>ticgit</b>  or  <b>ticgit-ng</b>  branch  of  its  development  repository,
       thereby keeping open issues close to the source without cluttering the tree.

       Every ticket consists of the following information:

       Title     A  short  summary  of  the problem.  This can be compared to the subject of an e-mail or to the
                 first line of a Git commit message.

       Ticket ID The Ticket ID (TicId) is the SHA-1 hash of the file which holds the ticket  name  (which  is  a
                 normalized  form of the title including the time of ticket creation and a small random number).
                 It is used to uniquely identify a ticket.

       Number    Apart from TicIds, tickets can also be referred to by using their number.  This will  often  be
                 preferred  to  TicIds  when  using  ticgit  from the command line (i.e., in everyday work), but
                 ticket numbers are not persistent (they change with every <b>ti</b> <b>list</b> invocation).

                 In the current version of ticgit, <b>ti</b> <b>list</b> does not show numbers any more, but they can still be
                 used (by counting manually).

       State     A ticket can either be <b>open</b>, <b>resolved</b>, <b>invalid</b> or put on <b>hold</b>.

       Assignment
                 The e-mail address of the person working on the ticket.

       Tag       A custom label which tells more about the nature of a ticket.  A  typical  example  is  <b>feature</b>
                 (not  a bug, but a feature suggestion). ticgit associates no special semantics to tags, you are
                 free to choose them however you like.

                 Tickets can have an arbitrary number of tags.

       Points    You can use this integer value to assign some numerical  value,  such  as  a  measure  for  the
                 importance, to each ticket.  Again, ticgit does not dictate how to use this field.

       Comments  Comments provide a simple form of communication between bug reporters and developers.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ti</b> supports the following commands:

       <b>list</b>      List  tickets.  By default, only <b>open</b> issues are shown; to show tickets in other states, use <b>-s</b>
                 <b>STATE</b>.  You can also select by tag (<b>-t</b> <b>TAG</b>) or by assignment (<b>-a</b> <b>ADDRESS</b>).  When running  <b>list</b>,
                 small  integer  numbers  will  be  assigned  to all shown tickets; you may use them to refer to
                 tickets in other commands until you call <b>list</b> again.

       <b>state</b>     Pass a ticket ID and a state specification to set the ticket's state information.  You can omit
                 the ticket ID to work on the current ticket.

       <b>show</b>      Show everything known about the specified ticket.  You can omit  the  ticket  ID  to  show  the
                 current ticket.

       <b>new</b>       Create  a  new  ticket.   This  will  launch an editor to let you enter a title, more detailled
                 information about the issue, and some tags.  Initially, the ticket will be in the <b>open</b> state.

       <b>checkout</b>  Set the current ticket.

       <b>comment</b>   Add a comment to the ticket specified on the command line.  If you do not pass one, the current
                 ticket will be used.

       <b>tag</b>       Pass a ticket ID and a tag name to add a label to an issue.  You can omit the ticket ID to  tag
                 the current ticket.  If you use the <b>-d</b> option, the tag will be removed instead of added.

       <b>assign</b>    Assign  the  specified  ticket to you (or to the given user, when <b>-u</b> <b>ADDRESS</b> is given).  If you
                 omit the ticket ID, the current ticket will be assigned.  Otherwise, you can prepend <b>-c</b> to  the
                 ticket ID to perform the <b>checkout</b> operation after assigning the ticket.

       <b>points</b>    Pass  a  ticket  ID  and some integer to assign a point value to the given ticket.  If you only
                 pass a number, this command manipulates the current ticket.

       <b>sync</b>      Synchronize tickets with the remote repository specified on the command line.   This  uses  the
                 underlying  push  and pull command implemented in Git, so you can use your usual named remotes.
                 The default remote is <b>origin</b>.

       <b>recent</b>    Get a human-readable changelog of the tickets maintained by ticgit.   This  command  takes  its
                 information straight from the commit messages of the <b>ticgit(-ng)</b> branch.

       These commands show usage information about themselves when passed the <b>--help</b> option.
