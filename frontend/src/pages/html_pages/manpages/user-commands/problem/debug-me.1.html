       debug-me - secure remote debugging

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>debug-me</b> <b>[options]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Debugging a problem over email is slow, tedious, and hard. The developer needs to see the your problem to
       understand  it. Debug-me aims to make debugging fast, fun, and easy, by letting the developer access your
       computer remotely, so they can immediately see and interact with the problem. Making your  problem  their
       problem gets it fixed fast.

       A  debug-me session is logged and signed with the developer's GnuPG key, producing a chain of evidence of
       what they saw and what they did.  So the developer's  good  reputation  is  leveraged  to  make  debug-me
       secure.  If you trust a developer to ship software to your computer, you can trust them to debug-me.

       When  you  start debug-me without any options, it will connect to a debug-me server, and print out an url
       that you can give to the developer to get them connected to you. Then debug-me will show you their  GnuPG
       key  and  who  has  signed  it,  and  will let you know if they are a known developer of software on your
       computer. If the developer has a good reputation, you can proceed to let them type into your console in a
       debug-me session. Once the session is done, the debug-me server will email you  the  signed  evidence  of
       what the developer did in the session.

       It's  a  good  idea to watch the debug-me session. The developer should be running their buggy program in
       different ways, perhaps running a debugger, or looking at  configuration  files.  They  should  *not*  be
       looking  at your personal files without asking you first in the debug-me chat window.  They should not be
       downloading or installing other software. If you see them do anything you don't  expect,  you  can  enter
       "/quit" in the control window to immediately end the debug-me session.

       If  the developer did do something bad, you'd have proof that they cannot be trusted, which you can share
       with the world. Knowing that is the case will keep most developers honest.

</pre><h4><b>USER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --run cmd
              Normally debug-me will run your login shell. To run some other command, use this option.

       --use-server url
              Specify a debug-me server to use. Not normally needed since there is a default server.

</pre><h4><b>DEVELOPER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       url    Connect to a debug-me session on the specified url, to see and interact with the user's  bug.  You
              need a GnuPG key to use this.

       --watch url
              Connect  to  a debug-me session on the specified url and display what happens in the session. Your
              keystrokes will not be sent to the session.

</pre><h4><b>COMMON</b> <b>SESSION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --control
              debug-me uses a separate window than the one displaying  the  debug-me  session,  to  control  the
              session.  This  control window is where debug-me shows the user what developers want to connect to
              the session.  The user and developer can also chat using the control window.

              Normally, the control window will be opened when debug-me starts, by running a  terminal  emulator
              (xterm  or  gnome-terminal,  etc).   If debug-me is not being run in a graphical environment, that
              won't work, and you'll need to open another shell prompt and run "debug-me --control" to see it.

</pre><h4><b>LOG</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --download url
              Download a debug-me log file from the specified url. Note that if the debug-me session is still in
              progress, this will continue downloading until the session ends. The signature chain  in  the  log
              file is verified as it is downloaded, but developer gpg signatures are not verified.

       --replay logfile
              Replay a debug-me log file with realistic pauses.

              While  this  is  running,  you can press Space to skip forward in the recording to the next point,
              which is useful when there are long pauses in the recording.

       --verify logfile
              Verify that the log file contains a valid chain of hashes, and valid signatures. Will exit nonzero
              if any problem is detected. Displays the gpg public keys of any developers who interacted with the
              debug-me session.

       --graphviz logfile
              Uses graphviz to generate a visualization of a debug-me log file.

       --show-hashes
              Include hashes in the graphviz visualization.

</pre><h4><b>SERVER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --server logdir
              Run a debug-me server, logging to the specified directory.

       --port N
              Specify a port for the debug-me server to listen to.

       --from-email address
              The server will email session logs to users. It's a good idea to provide  a  real  email  address,
              otherwise  a dummy one will be used.  You can also set the enviroment variable DEBUG_ME_FROM_EMAIL
              to configure this.

       --delete-old-logs
              Normally the server will retain old log files so that users and developers can refer to them. This
              option makes it delete the log file once the session is done.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="file:~/.debug-me/log/">~/.debug-me/log/</a>
              Sessions are logged to here. The log file name is displayed when debug-me exits.

       <a href="file:~/.debug-me/log/remote/">~/.debug-me/log/remote/</a>
              When using debug-me to connect to a remote session, the session will be logged to here.

       /usr/share/debug-me/keyring/*.gpg
              When verifying a developer's gpg key, debug-me checks if it's  listed  in  the  keyrings  in  this
              directory, which can be provided by software installed on the computer.
