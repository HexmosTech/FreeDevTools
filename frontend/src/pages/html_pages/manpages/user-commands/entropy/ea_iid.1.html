       ea_iid - Run IID tests for entropy assesment

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ea_iid</b> [<b>-i</b>|<b>-c</b>] [<b>-a</b>|<b>-t</b>] [<b>-v</b>] [<b>-q</b>] [<b>-l</b> &lt;index&gt;,&lt;samples&gt; ] &lt;file_name&gt; [bits_per_symbol]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Run IID tests for entropy assesment.

       &lt;file_name&gt;: Must be relative path to a binary file with at least 1 million entries (samples).

       [bits_per_symbol]: Must be between 1-8, inclusive. By default this value is inferred from the data.

       [<b>-i</b>|<b>-c</b>]: '-i' for initial entropy estimate, '-c' for conditioned sequential dataset entropy estimate. The
              initial entropy estimate is the default.

       [<b>-a</b>|<b>-t</b>]:  '-a'  produces  the  'H_bitstring' assessment using all read bits, '-t' truncates the bitstring
              used to produce the `H_bitstring` assessment to 1000000 bits. Test all data by default.

              Note: When testing binary data, no `H_bitstring` assessment is produced,  so  the  `-a`  and  `-t`
              options produce the same results for the initial assessment of binary data.

       <b>-v</b>: Optional verbosity flag for more output. Can be used multiple times.

       <b>-q</b>: Quiet mode, less output to screen. This will override any verbose flags.

       <b>-l</b> &lt;index&gt;,&lt;samples&gt;   Read the &lt;index&gt; substring of length &lt;samples&gt;.

              Samples  are assumed to be packed into 8-bit values, where the least significant 'bits_per_symbol'
              bits constitute the symbol.

       <b>-i</b>: Initial Entropy Estimate (Section 3.1.3)

              Computes the initial entropy estimate H_I as  described  in  Section  3.1.3  (not  accounting  for
              H_submitter)  using  the  entropy  estimators  specified  in Section 6.3.  If 'bits_per_symbol' is
              greater than 1, the samples are also converted to bitstrings and assessed to  create  H_bitstring;
              for  multi-bit  symbols,  two entropy estimates are computed: H_original and H_bitstring.  Returns
              min(H_original,  bits_per_symbol  X   H_bitstring).   The   initial   entropy   estimate   H_I   =
              min(H_submitter, H_original, bits_per_symbol X H_bitstring).

       <b>-c</b>: Conditioned Sequential Dataset Entropy Estimate (Section 3.1.5.2)

              Computes  the  entropy  estimate  per  bit  h'  for  the  conditioned  sequential  dataset  if the
              conditioning function is non-vetted. The samples are converted  to  a  bitstring.   Returns  h'  =
              min(H_bitstring).

       <b>-o</b>: Set Output Type to JSON

              Changes the output format to JSON and sets the file location for the output file.

       <b>--version</b>: Prints tool version information
