       ea_restart - Run restart tests for entropy assesment

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ea_restart</b> [<b>-i</b>|<b>-n</b>] [<b>-v</b>] [<b>-q</b>] &lt;file_name&gt; [bits_per_symbol] &lt;H_I&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Run restart tests for entropy assesment.

       &lt;file_name&gt;: Must be relative path to a binary file with at least 1 million entries (samples), and in the
              "row dataset" format described in SP800-90B Section 3.1.4.1.

       [bits_per_symbol]: Must be between 1-8, inclusive.

       &lt;H_I&gt;: Initial entropy estimate.

       [<b>-i</b>|<b>-n</b>]: '-i' for IID data, '-n' for non-IID data. Non-IID is the default.

       <b>-v</b>: Optional verbosity flag for more output.

       <b>-q</b>: Quiet mode, less output to screen.

              Restart  samples are assumed to be packed into 8-bit values, where the rightmost 'bits_per_symbol'
              bits constitute the sample.

              This program performs restart testing as described in Restart  Tests  (Section  3.1.4).  The  data
              consists  of  1000  restarts, each with 1000 samples. The data is converted to rows and columns as
              described Section 3.1.4.1. The sanity check (Section 3.1.4.3) and  the  validation  test  (Section
              3.1.4.2) are performed on this data.

              If  the  restart  data  passes the sanity check and validation test, this program returns min(H_r,
              H_c, H_I), which is  either  the  validated  entropy  assessment  or  used  to  derive  'h_in'  if
              conditioning is used (Section 3.1.5).
