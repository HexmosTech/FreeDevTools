</pre><h4><b>WARNING</b></h4><pre>
       This man page is not a complete set of documentation - the complexity of the atlc project makes man pages
       not an ideal way to document it, although  out  of  completeness,  man  pages  are  produced.   The  best
       documentation  that  was current at the time the version was produced should be found on your hard drive,
       usually at
       /usr/local/share/atlc/docs/html-docs/index.html
       although it might be elsewhere if your system administrator  chose  to  install  the  package  elsewhere.
       Sometimes,  errors are corrected in the documentation and placed at <a href="http://atlc.sourceforge.net/">http://atlc.sourceforge.net/</a> before a
       new release of atlc is released.  Please, if you notice a problem with the documentation - even  spelling
       errors and typos, please let me know.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ</b>  is  a  pre-processor for <b>atlc</b>, the finite difference program that is used to
       calculate the properties of a two and three conductor electrical transmission  line  of  arbitrary  cross
       section. The program <b>create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ</b> is used as a fast way of generating bitmaps (there is no
       need  to  use  a  graphics  program),  for  a  circular  conductor  inside  a circular conductor (coaxial
       conductors), like this:

       The parameter 'D' is the inner dimensions of the outer conductor and 'd' is the  outer  diameter  of  the
       inner  conductor.   The  inner  conductor is offset 'h' from the centre of the outer conductor. The whole
       region is surrounded by a dielectric of relative permittivity 'Er'.

       The bitmap is printed to 'outfile.bmp' - the last command line argument.

       The bitmaps produced by <b>create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ</b> are 24-bit bit colour bitmaps,  as  are  required  by
       <b>atlc</b>.

       The permittivities of the dielectric 'Er' determines the colours in the bitmap. If Er is 1.0, 1.006, 2.1,
       2.2,  2.33,  2.5,  3.3,  3.335, 3,7, 4.8, 10.2 or 100, then the colour corresponding to that permittivity
       will be set according to the colours defined in COLOURS below. If Er is not one of those  permittivities,
       the  region  of  permittivity  Er will be set to the colour 0xCAFF00. The program <b>atlc</b> does not know what
       this permittivity is, so <b>atlc</b>, must be told with the command line option -d, as in example 4 below.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-b</b> <b>bitmapsize</b>
       is used to set the size of the bitmap, and so the accuracy  to  which  atlc  is  able  to  calculate  the
       transmission line's properties. The default value for 'bitmapsize' is normally 4, although this is set at
       compile time. The value can be set anywhere from 1 to 15, but more than 8 is probably not sensible.

       <b>-f</b> <b>outfile</b>
       Set  the output filename. By default, the bitmap is sent to stdout, but it *must* be sent to a file, with
       this option, or as described above.

       <b>-v</b>
       Causes <b>create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ</b> to print some data to stderr. Note, nothing  extra  goes  to  standard
       output, as that is expected to be redirected to a bitmap file.

</pre><h4><b>COLOURS</b></h4><pre>
       The 24-bit bitmaps that <b>atlc</b> expects, have 8 bits assigned to represent the amount of red, 8 for blue and
       8  for  green.  Hence there are 256 levels of red, green and blue, making a total of 256*256*256=16777216
       colours.  Every one of the possible 16777216 colours can be defined precisely by the  stating  the  exact
       amount of red, green and blue, as in:

       red         = 255,000,000 or 0xff0000
       green       = 000,255,000 or 0x00ff00
       blue        = 000,000,255 or 0x0000ff
       black       = 000,000,000 or 0x000000
       white       = 255,255,255 or 0xffffff
       Brown       = 255,000,255 or 0xff00ff
       gray        = 142,142,142 or 0x8e8e8e

       Some  colours,  such  as  pink,  turquoise,  sandy, brown, gray etc may mean slightly different things to
       different people. This is not so with <b>atlc</b>, as the program  expects  the  colours  below  to  be  EXACTLY
       defined  as given. Whether you feel the colour is sandy or yellow is up to you, but if you use it in your
       bitmap, then it either needs to be a colour reconised by atlc, <b>or</b> you must define it with a command  line
       option (see OPTIONS and example 5 below).
       The following conductors are reconised by atlc:
       red    = 255,000,000 or 0xff0000 is the live conductor.
       green  = 000,255,000 or 0x00ff00 is the grounded conductor.
       blue   = 000,000,000 or 0x000000 is the negative conductor

       All  bitmaps <b>must</b> have the live (red) and grounded (green) conductor. The blue conductor is not currently
       supported, but it will be used to indicate a negative conductor, which will be needed if/when the program
       gets extended to analyse directional couplers.

       The following dielectrics are reconised by atlc <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>are</b> <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ<b>.</b>

       white     255,255,255 or 0xFFFFFF as Er=1.0   (vacuum)
       pink      255,202,202 or 0xFFCACA as Er=1.0006 (air)
       blue      000,000,255 or 0x0000FF as Er=2.1   (PTFE)
       Mid gray  142,242,142 or 0x8E8E8E as Er=2.2   (duroid 5880)
       mauve     255.000,255 or 0xFF00FF as Er=2.33  (polyethylene)
       yellow    255,255,000 or 0xFFFF00 as Er=2.5   (polystyrene)
       sandy     239,203,027 or 0xEFCC1A as Er=3.3   (PVC)
       brown     188,127,096 or 0xBC7F60 as Er=3.335 (epoxy resin)
       Turquoise 026,239,179 or 0x1AEFB3 as Er=4.8   (glass PCB)
       Dark gray 142,142,142 or ox696969 as Er=6.15  (duroid 6006)
       L. gray   240,240,240 or 0xDCDCDC as Er=10.2  (duroid 6010)

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b></h4><pre>
       Although <b>create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ</b> is used for circular inner and outer conductors, the outside of  the
       outer  conductor  is  drawn  as  a  square.  This  is  for  convenience  and  makes  no difference to the
       calculations. The inside is of the outer conductor is drawn as a circle.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Here are a few examples of the use of <b>create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ</b>. Again, see the html  documentation  in
       atlc-X.Y.Z/docs/html-docs/index.html for more examples.

       1)  In the first example, the outer conductor has an inside diameter of 12 units (inches, mm, feet etc.),
       the inner has an outside diameter of 3.9 units.  The inner is placed centrally (h=0) and  the  dielectric
       is vacuum (Er=1.0).
       <b>%</b> <b>create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ</b> <b>12</b> <b>3.9</b> <b>0</b> <b>1.0</b> <b>coaxial_1.bmp</b>
       <b>%</b> <b>atlc</b> <b>coaxial_1.bmp</b>
       <b>atlc</b> will indicate the correct value of impedance to be 67.3667 Ohms, whereas an exact analysis will show
       the true value to be 67.4358 Ohms, so <b>atlc</b> has an error of 0.102%.

       2)  In  this  second example, the conductor sizes are the sames as in example 1, but the inner is located
       3.5 units off-centre and the dielectric has a relative permittivity of 2.1 (Er of  PTFE)  The  output  is
       sent to a file not_in_centre.bmp which is then processed by <b>atlc</b>
       <b>%</b> <b>create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ</b> <b>12</b> <b>3.9</b> <b>3.5</b> <b>2.1</b> <b>not_in_centre.bmp</b>
       <b>%</b> <b>atlc</b> <b>not_in_centre.bmp</b>
       The  impedance of this is theoretically 24.315342 Ohms, as create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ will calculate for
       you. atlc's estimate is 24.2493 Ohms, an error of only -0.271 %.

       3) In the third example the bitmap is made larger, to increase accuracy, but otherwise this is  identical
       to the previous one.
       <b>%</b> <b>create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ</b> <b>-b8</b> <b>12</b> <b>3.9</b> <b>3.5</b> <b>2.1</b> <b>bigger_not_in_centre.bmp</b>
       <b>%</b> <b>atlc</b> <b>bigger_not_in_centre.bmp</b>
       This  time  atlc  will take much longer to calculate Zo, since the bitmap is larger and so it needs to do
       more calculations. However, the final result should be more accurate. In this case, the  result  reported
       is  24.2461 Ohms, an error that's marginally smaller than before at 0.285 %.  It is possible there may be
       something to be gained by decreasing the cutoff at larger grids, so this is being investigated.  However,
       errors almost always below 0.25 %, no matter what is being analysed.

       In  the  fourth example, a material with a relativity permittivity 7.89 of is used. There is no change in
       how to use <b>create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ</b>, but since this permittivity is not one of the pre-defined  values
       (see  COLOURS),  we  must  tell  <b>atlc</b>  what  it  is.   The  colour will be set an olive green one, with a
       hexacidcal representation of red=0xCA, blue=OxFF and green = 0x00. This just happens to  be  the  default
       colour  used when the permittivity is unknown. So atlc must be given this information, like thisL
       <b>%</b> <b>create_bmp_for_circ_in_circ</b> <b>23</b> <b>9</b> <b>0</b> <b>7.89</b> <b>an_odd_er.bmp</b>
       <b>%</b>  <b>atlc</b> <b>-d</b> <b>CAFF00=7.89</b> <b>an_odd_er.bmp</b> This has a theoretical impedance of 20.041970 Ohms, but atlc version
       3.0.1 will calculate it to be 20.0300, an error of -0.058 % !!! If you look  at  the  file  an_odd_er.bmp
       with  a  graphics  package,  you  will see there are 3 colours in it - the red inner conductor, the green
       outer and an olive-green dielectric.
