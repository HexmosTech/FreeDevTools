       <b>create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect</b>  -  bitmap  generator  for rectangular conductor inside rectangular conductor
       (part of <b>atlc</b>)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect</b> <b>[options...</b> <b>]</b> <b>W</b> <b>H</b> <b>a</b> <b>b</b> <b>c</b> <b>d</b> <b>w</b> <b>h</b> <b>Er1</b> <b>Er2</b> <b>filename.bmp</b>

</pre><h4><b>WARNING</b></h4><pre>
       This man page is not a complete set of documentation - the complexity of the atlc project makes man pages
       not an ideal way to document it, although  out  of  completeness,  man  pages  are  produced.   The  best
       documentation  that  was current at the time the version was produced should be found on your hard drive,
       usually at
       /usr/local/share/atlc/docs/html-docs/index.html
       although it might be elsewhere if your system administrator  chose  to  install  the  package  elsewhere.
       Sometimes,  errors are corrected in the documentation and placed at <a href="http://atlc.sourceforge.net/">http://atlc.sourceforge.net/</a> before a
       new release of atlc is released.  Please, if you notice a problem with the documentation - even  spelling
       errors and typos, please let me know.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect</b>  is  a  pre-processor for <b>atlc</b>, the finite difference program that is used to
       calculate the properties of a two and three conductor electrical transmission  line  of  arbitrary  cross
       section. The program <b>create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect</b> is used as a fast way of generating bitmaps (there is no
       need  to  use  a  graphics program), for a rectangular conductor inside a rectangular conductor, with two
       dieletrics, like this:

       -----------------------------------------------------  ^
       |                                                   |  |
       |     &lt;--------------d-------------------&gt;          |  |
       |                                                   |  |

       |         |  off-centre)         |   |              |  |
       |         |                      |   |              |  |
       |     ------------------------------------ ^        |  |
       |     |..................................| |        |  |

       -----------------------------------------------------  |
       &lt;---------------------------W-----------------------&gt;

       The parameters 'W' and 'H' and the inner dimensions of the outer conductor.  The outer dimensions of  the
       inner  conductor  are  'w' and 'c'. The inner conductor is assumed to rest on a dielectric (Er2) which is
       'd' wide and outer conductor an the inner conductor is offset 'b' from the  left  hand  sidewall  of  the
       outer  conductor.  The  whole  region  is  surrounded by a dielectric of relative permittivity 'Er1'. The
       dielectrics 'Er1' and then 'Er1' and 'Er2' will both be 1.0

       The bitmap is printed to the file specifiled as the last argument

       <b>create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect</b> <b>-f</b> <b>filename.bmp</b> <b>W</b> <b>H</b> <b>a</b> <b>b</b> <b>c</b> <b>d</b> <b>w</b> <b>h</b> <b>Er1</b> <b>Er2</b>

       The bitmaps produced by <b>create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect</b> are 24-bit bit colour bitmaps,  as  are  required  by
       <b>atlc</b>.

       The  permittivities of the bitmap, set by 'Er1' and 'Er2', determine the colours in the bitmap. If Er1 or
       Er2 is 1.0, 1.0006, 2.1, 2.2, 2.33, 2.5, 3.3, 3.335, 3.7, 4.8, 10.2 or 100, then the colour corresponding
       to that permittivity will be set according to the colours defined in COLOURS below. If Er1 is not one  of
       those  permittivities,  the  region of permittivity Er1 will be set to the colour 0xCAFF00. If Er2 is not
       one of those values, then the region of the image will be set to the colour 0xAC82AC.  The  program  <b>atlc</b>
       does not know what these permittivites are, so they <b>atlc</b>, must be told with the comand line option -d, as
       in example 4 below.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-b</b> <b>bitmapsize</b>
       is  used  to  set  the  size  of  the  bitmap, and so the accuracy to which atlc is able to calculate the
       transmission line's properties. The default value for 'bitmapsize' is normally 4, although this is set at
       compile time. The value can be set anywhere from 1 to 15, but more than 8 is probably not sensible.

       <b>-f</b> <b>outfile</b>
       Set the output filename. By default, the bitmap is sent to stdout, but it *must* be sent to a file,  with
       this option, or as described above.

       <b>-v</b>
       Causes  <b>create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect</b>  to  print  some data to stderr. Note, nothing extra goes to standard
       output, as that is expected to be redirected to a bitmap file.

</pre><h4><b>COLOURS</b></h4><pre>
       The 24-bit bitmaps that <b>atlc</b> expects, have 8 bits assigned to represent the amount of red, 8 for blue and
       8 for green. Hence there are 256 levels of red, green and blue, making a  total  of  256*256*256=16777216
       colours.   Every  one  of the possible 16777216 colours can be defined precisely by the stating the exact
       amount of red, green and blue, as in:

       red         = 255,000,000 or 0xff0000
       green       = 000,255,000 or 0x00ff00
       blue        = 000,000,255 or 0x0000ff
       black       = 000,000,000 or 0x000000
       white       = 255,255,255 or 0xffffff
       Brown       = 255,000,255 or 0xff00ff
       gray        = 142,142,142 or 0x8e8e8e

       Some colours, such as pink, turquoise, sandy, brown, gray etc  may  mean  slightly  different  things  to
       different  people.  This  is  not  so  with  <b>atlc</b>, as the program expects the colours below to be EXACTLY
       defined as given. Whether you feel the colour is sandy or yellow is up to you, but if you use it in  your
       bitmap, then it either needs to be a colour recognised by atlc, <b>or</b> you must define it with a command line
       option (see OPTIONS and example 5 below).
       red    = 255,000,000 or 0xFF0000 is the live conductor.
       green  = 000,255,000 or 0x00FF00 is the grounded conductor.
       blue   = 000,000,000 or 0x0000FF is the negative conductor

       All  bitmaps <b>must</b> have the live (red) and grounded (green) conductor. The blue conductor is not currently
       supported, but it will be used to indicate a negative conductor, which will be needed if/when the program
       gets extended to analyse directional couplers.

       The following dielectrics are recognised by atlc <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>are</b> <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect<b>.</b>

       white     255,255,255 or 0xFFFFFF as Er=1.0    (vacuum)
       pink      255,202,202 or 0xFFCACA as Er=1.0006 (air)
       L. blue   130,052,255 or 0x8235EF as Er=2.1    (PTFE)
       Mid gray  142,242,142 or 0x8E8E8E as Er=2.2    (duroid 5880)
       mauve     255.000,255 or 0xFF00FF as Er=2.33  (polyethylene)
       yellow    255,255,000 or 0xFFFF00 as Er=2.5    (polystyrene)
       sandy     239,203,027 or 0xEFCC1A as Er=3.3    (PVC)
       brown     188,127,096 or 0xBC7F60 as Er=3.335  (epoxy resin)
       Turquoise 026,239,179 or 0x1AEFB3 as Er=4.8    (glass PCB)
       Dark gray 142,142,142 or 0x696969 as Er=6.15   (duroid 6006)
       L. gray   240,240,240 or 0xDCDCDC as Er=10.2  (duroid 6010)
       D. orange 213,160,067 or 0xD5A04D as Er=100.0 (mainly for test purposes)

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Here are a few examples of the use of <b>create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect</b>. Again, see the html  documentation  in
       atlc-X.Y.Z/docs/html-docs/index.html for more examples.

       In  the  first example, there is just an air dielectric, so Er1=Er2=1.0.  The inner of 1x1 inches (or mm,
       miles etc) is placed centrally in an outer with dimensions 3 x 3 inches.

       The exact place where the dielectric starts (a) and its width (d) are unimportant, but they must still be
       entered.

       <b>%</b> <b>create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect</b> <b>3</b> <b>3</b> <b>1</b> <b>1</b> <b>1</b> <b>1</b> <b>1</b> <b>1</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>ex1.bmp</b>
       <b>%</b> <b>atlc</b> <b>ex1.bmp</b>

       In this second example, an inner of 15.0 mm x 0.5 mm is surrounded by an outer with  internal  dimensions
       of  61.5 x 20.1 mm. There is a material with permittivity 2.1 (Er of PTFE) below the inner conductor. The
       output from <b>create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect</b> is sent to a file ex1.bmp, which is then processed by <b>atlc</b>

       <b>%</b> <b>create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect</b> <b>61.5</b> <b>20.1</b> <b>5</b> <b>22</b> <b>0.5</b> <b>50</b> <b>15</b> <b>5</b> <b>1.0</b> <b>2.1</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>ex2.bmp</b>
       <b>%</b> <b>atlc</b> <b>ex2.bmp</b>

       In example 3, the bitmap is made larger, to increase accuracy, but otherwise this  is  identical  to  the
       second example.  <b>%</b> <b>create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect</b> <b>-b7</b> <b>61.5</b> <b>20.1</b> <b>5</b> <b>22</b> <b>0.5</b> <b>50</b> <b>15</b> <b>5</b> <b>1.0</b> <b>2.1</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>ex3.bmp</b>
       <b>%</b> <b>atlc</b> <b>ex3.bmp</b>

       In  the  fourth example, materials with permittivites 2.78 and 7.89 are used. While there is no change in
       how to use <b>create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect</b>, since these permittivities are not known, we must tell <b>atlc</b>  what
       they  are.   <b>%</b>  <b>create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect</b>  <b>61</b>  <b>20</b>  <b>1</b>  <b>4</b>  <b>22</b>  <b>0.5</b>  <b>50</b> <b>15</b> <b>5</b> <b>2.78</b> <b>7.89</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>ex5.bmp</b> <b>%</b> <b>atlc</b> <b>-d</b>
       <b>CAFF00=2.78</b> <b>-d</b> <b>AC82AC=7.89</b> <b>ex5.bmp</b> In the sixth and final example, the -v option is used  to  print  some
       extra data to stderr from <b>create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect</b>.
