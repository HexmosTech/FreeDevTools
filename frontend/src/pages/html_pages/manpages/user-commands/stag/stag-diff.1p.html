</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       stag-diff - finds the difference between two stag files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         stag-diff -ignore foo-id -ignore bar-id file1.xml file2.xml

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Compares two data trees and reports whether they match. If they do not match, the mismatch is reported.

   <b>ARGUMENTS</b>
       -help|h
           shows this document

       -ignore|i ELEMENT
           these nodes are ignored for the purposes of comparison. Note that attributes are treated as elements,
           prefixed by the containing element id. For example, if you have

             &lt;foo ID="wibble"&gt;

           And you wish to ignore the ID attribute, then you would use the switch

             -ignore foo-ID

           You can specify multiple elements to ignore like this

             -i foo -i bar -i baz

           You can also specify paths

             -i foo/bar/bar-id

       -parser|p FORMAT
           which  parser  to  use.  The  default is XML. This can also be autodetected by the file suffix. Other
           alternatives are <b>sxpr</b> and <b>itext</b>. See Data::Stag for details.

       -report|r ELEMENT
           report mismatches as they occur on each element of type ELEMENT

           multiple elements can be specified

       -verbose|v
           used in conjunction with the <b>-report</b> switch

           shows the tree of the mismatching element

   <b>OUTPUT</b>
       If a mismatch is reported, a report is generated displaying the subpart of the tree  that  could  not  be
       matched. This will look like this:

       REASON: no_matching_node: annotation
         no_matching_node: feature_set
           no_matching_node: feature_span
             no_matching_node: evidence
               no_matching_node: evidence-id
                 data_mismatch(:15077290 ne :15077291): evidence-id AND evidence-id

       Due  to  the  nature  of tree matching, it can be difficult to specify exactly how trees do not match. To
       investigate this, you may need to use the <b>-r</b> and <b>-v</b> options. For the  above  output,  I  would  recommend
       using

         stag-diff -r feature_span -v

   <b>ALGORITHM</b>
       Both trees are recursively traversed... see the actual code for how this works

       The order of elements is not important; eg

         &lt;foo&gt;
           &lt;bar&gt;
             &lt;baz&gt;1&lt;/baz&gt;
           &lt;/bar&gt;
           &lt;bar&gt;
             &lt;baz&gt;2&lt;/baz&gt;
           &lt;/bar&gt;
         &lt;/foo&gt;

       matches

         &lt;foo&gt;
           &lt;bar&gt;
             &lt;baz&gt;2&lt;/baz&gt;
           &lt;/bar&gt;
           &lt;bar&gt;
             &lt;baz&gt;1&lt;/baz&gt;
           &lt;/bar&gt;
         &lt;/foo&gt;

       The  recursive  nature  of  this  algorithm means that certain tree comparisons will explode wrt time and
       memory. I think this will only happen with very deep trees where nodes high up in the tree  can  only  be
       differentiated by nodes low down in the tree.

       Both trees are loaded into memory to begin with, so it may thrash with very large documents
