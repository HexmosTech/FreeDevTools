</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       Publishes a package to the registry so that it can be installed by name.

       By default npm will publish to the public registry. This can be
       overridden by specifying a different default registry or using a
       <b>scope</b> in the name, combined with a
       scope-configured registry (see
       <b>package.json</b>).

       A <b>package</b> is interpreted the same way as other commands (like
       <b>npm</b> <b>install</b> and can be:

        • a) a folder containing a program described by a
          <b>package.json</b> file

        • b) a gzipped tarball containing (a)

        • c) a url that resolves to (b)

        • d) a <b>&lt;name&gt;@&lt;version&gt;</b> that is published on the registry (see
          <b>registry</b>) with (c)

        • e) a <b>&lt;name&gt;@&lt;tag&gt;</b> (see <b>npm</b> <b>dist-tag</b>) that
          points to (d)

        • f) a <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> that has a "latest" tag satisfying (e)

        • g) a <b>&lt;git</b> <b>remote</b> <b>url&gt;</b> that resolves to (a)

       The publish will fail if the package name and version combination already
       exists in the specified registry.

       Once a package is published with a given name and version, that specific
       name and version combination can never be used again, even if it is removed
       with <b>npm</b> <b>unpublish</b>.

       As of <b>npm@5</b>, both a sha1sum and an integrity field with a sha512sum of the
       tarball will be submitted to the registry during publication. Subsequent
       installs will use the strongest supported algorithm to verify downloads.

       Similar to <b>--dry-run</b> see <b>npm</b> <b>pack</b>, which figures
       out the files to be included and packs them into a tarball to be uploaded
       to the registry.

</pre><h4><b>Files</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>package</b></h4><pre>
       To see what will be included in your package, run <b>npx</b> <b>npm-packlist</b>.  All
       files are included by default, with the following exceptions:

        • Certain files that are relevant to package installation and distribution
          are always included.  For example, <b>package.json</b>, <b>README.md</b>,
          <b>LICENSE</b>, and so on.

        • If there is a "files" list in
          <b>package.json</b>, then only the files
          specified will be included.  (If directories are specified, then they
          will be walked recursively and their contents included, subject to the
          same ignore rules.)

        • If there is a <b>.gitignore</b> or <b>.npmignore</b> file, then ignored files in
          that and all child directories will be excluded from the package.  If
          <u>both</u> files exist, then the <b>.gitignore</b> is ignored, and only the
          <b>.npmignore</b> is used.

        <b>.npmignore</b> files follow the same pattern
        rules
        as <b>.gitignore</b> files

        • If the file matches certain patterns, then it will <u>never</u> be included,
          unless explicitly added to the <b>&amp;quot;files&amp;quot;</b> list in <b>package.json</b>, or
          un-ignored with a <b>!</b> rule in a <b>.npmignore</b> or <b>.gitignore</b> file.

        • Symbolic links are never included in npm packages.

       See <b>developers</b> for full details on what's
       included in the published package, as well as details on how the package is
       built.
