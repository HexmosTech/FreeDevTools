</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       buildah-pull - Pull an image from a registry.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>buildah</b> <b>pull</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>image</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Pulls  an  image based upon the specified input. It supports all transports from <b><a href="../man5/containers-transports.5.html">containers-transports</a>(5)</b>
       (see examples below). If no transport is specified, the input is subject to  short-name  resolution  (see
       <b><a href="../man5/containers-registries.conf.5.html">containers-registries.conf</a>(5)</b>) and the <b>docker</b> (i.e., container registry) transport is used.

   <b>DEPENDENCIES</b>
       Buildah resolves the path to the registry to pull from by using the /etc/containers/registries.conf file,
       <a href="../man5/containers-registries.conf.5.html">containers-registries.conf</a>(5).   If the <b>buildah</b> <b>pull</b> command fails with an "image not known" error, first
       verify that the registries.conf file is installed and configured appropriately.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       The image ID of the image that was pulled.  On error 1 is returned.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--all-tags</b>, <b>-a</b>

       All tagged images in the repository will be pulled.

       <b>--arch</b>="ARCH"

       Set the ARCH of the image to be pulled to the provided value instead of using  the  architecture  of  the
       host. (Examples: arm, arm64, 386, amd64, ppc64le, s390x)

       <b>--authfile</b> <u>path</u>

       Path  of  the  authentication  file.  Default is ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json. See <a href="../man5/containersauth.json.5.html">containers-</a>
       <a href="../man5/containersauth.json.5.html">auth.json</a>(5) for more information. This file is created using <b>buildah</b> <b>login</b>.

       If the authorization state is not found there, $HOME/.docker/config.json is checked, which is  set  using
       <b>docker</b> <b>login</b>.

       Note: You can also override the default path of the authentication file by setting the REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE
       environment variable. <b>export</b> <b>REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE=path</b>

       <b>--cert-dir</b> <u>path</u>

       Use  certificates  at  <u>path</u>  (*.crt, *.cert, *.key) to connect to the registry.  The default certificates
       directory is <u>/etc/containers/certs.d</u>.

       <b>--creds</b> <u>creds</u>

       The [username[:password]] to use to authenticate with the registry if required.  If one  or  both  values
       are  not  supplied,  a  command  line  prompt  will appear and the value can be entered.  The password is
       entered without echo.

       <b>--decryption-key</b> <u>key[:passphrase]</u>

       The [key[:passphrase]] to be used for decryption of images. Key can point to  keys  and/or  certificates.
       Decryption  will  be  tried  with all keys. If the key is protected by a passphrase, it is required to be
       passed in the argument and omitted otherwise.

       <b>--os</b>="OS"

       Set the OS of the image to be pulled instead of using the current operating system of the host.

       <b>--platform</b>="OS/ARCH[/VARIANT]"

       Set the OS/ARCH of the image to be pulled to the provided value instead of using  the  current  operating
       system and architecture of the host (for example <b>linux/arm</b>).

       OS/ARCH  pairs  are  those  used  by  the Go Programming Language.  In several cases the ARCH value for a
       platform differs from one produced by other tools such as the <b>arch</b> command.  Valid  OS  and  architecture
       name      combinations      are     listed     as     values     for     $GOOS     and     $GOARCH     at
       https://golang.org/doc/install/source#environment, and can also be found by running <b>go</b> <b>tool</b> <b>dist</b> <b>list</b>.

       <b>NOTE:</b> The <b>--platform</b> option may not be used in combination with the <b>--arch</b>, <b>--os</b>, or <b>--variant</b> options.

       <b>--policy</b>=<b>always</b>|<b>missing</b>|<b>never</b>|<b>newer</b>

       Pull image policy. The default is <b>missing</b>.

              • <b>always</b>: Always pull the image and throw an error if the pull fails.

              • <b>missing</b>: Pull the image only if it could not be found in the local containers storage.  Throw an
                error if no image could be found and the pull fails.

              • <b>never</b>: Never pull the image but use the one from the local containers storage.  Throw  an  error
                if no image could be found.

              • <b>newer</b>:  Pull if the image on the registry is newer than the one in the local containers storage.
                An image is considered to be newer when the digests are different.  Comparing the time stamps is
                prone to errors.  Pull errors are suppressed if a local image was found.

       <b>--quiet</b>, <b>-q</b>

       If an image needs to be pulled from the registry, suppress progress output.

       <b>--remove-signatures</b>

       Don't copy signatures when pulling images.

       <b>--retry</b> <u>attempts</u>

       Number of times to retry in case of failure when performing pull of images from registry.

       Defaults to <b>3</b>.

       <b>--retry-delay</b> <u>duration</u>

       Duration of delay between retry attempts in case of failure when performing pull of images from registry.

       Defaults to <b>2s</b>.

       <b>--tls-verify</b> <u>bool-value</u>

       Require HTTPS and verification of certificates when talking to container registries (defaults  to  true).
       TLS verification cannot be used when talking to an insecure registry.

       <b>--variant</b>=""

       Set the architecture variant of the image to be pulled.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       buildah pull imagename

       buildah pull docker://myregistry.example.com/imagename

       buildah pull docker-daemon:imagename:imagetag

       buildah pull docker-archive:filename

       buildah pull oci-archive:filename

       buildah pull dir:directoryname

       buildah pull --tls-verify=false myregistry/myrepository/imagename:imagetag

       buildah pull --creds=myusername:mypassword --cert-dir <a href="file:~/auth">~/auth</a> myregistry/myrepository/imagename:imagetag

       buildah pull --authfile=/tmp/auths/myauths.json myregistry/myrepository/imagename:imagetag

       buildah pull --arch=aarch64 myregistry/myrepository/imagename:imagetag

       buildah pull --arch=arm --variant=v7 myregistry/myrepository/imagename:imagetag

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>BUILD_REGISTRY_SOURCES</b>

       BUILD_REGISTRY_SOURCES,  if set, is treated as a JSON object which contains lists of registry names under
       the keys <b>insecureRegistries</b>, <b>blockedRegistries</b>, and <b>allowedRegistries</b>.

       When pulling an image from a registry, if the name of the registry  matches  any  of  the  items  in  the
       <b>blockedRegistries</b>   list,   the   image  pull  attempt  is  denied.   If  there  are  registries  in  the
       <b>allowedRegistries</b> list, and the registry's name is not in the list, the pull attempt is denied.

       <b>TMPDIR</b> The TMPDIR environment variable allows the user to specify where temporary files are stored  while
       pulling and pushing images.  Defaults to '<a href="file:/var/tmp">/var/tmp</a>'.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>registries.conf</b> (<b>/etc/containers/registries.conf</b>)

       registries.conf  is the configuration file which specifies which container registries should be consulted
       when completing image names which do not include a registry or domain portion.

       <b>policy.json</b> (<b>/etc/containers/policy.json</b>)

       Signature policy file.  This defines the trust policy for container  images.   Controls  which  container
       registries can be used for image, and whether or not the tool should trust the images.
