</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mosh - mobile shell with roaming and intelligent local echo

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mosh</b> [<u>options</u>] [--] [user@]host [command...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mosh</b>  (mobile  shell)  is  a  remote terminal application that supports intermittent connectivity, allows
       roaming, and provides speculative local echo and line editing of user keystrokes.

       Compared with <b>ssh</b>, <b>mosh</b> is more robust — its connections  stay  up  across  sleeps  and  changes  in  the
       client's IP address — and more responsive, because the protocol is tolerant of packet loss and the client
       can echo most keystrokes immediately, without waiting for a network round-trip.

       <b>mosh</b>  uses  <b>ssh</b>  to establish a connection to the remote host and authenticate with existing means (e.g.,
       public-key authentication or a password). <b>mosh</b> executes the unprivileged <b>mosh-server</b>  helper  program  on
       the  server,  then  closes  the SSH connection and starts the <b>mosh-client</b>, which establishes a long-lived
       datagram connection over UDP.

       To improve responsiveness, <b>mosh</b> runs a predictive model of  the  server's  behavior  in  the  background,
       trying  to  guess  the  effect  of  each keystroke on the screen. It makes predictions for normal typing,
       backspace, and the left- and right-arrow keys. When  it  is  confident,  <b>mosh</b>  displays  the  predictions
       without  waiting  for the server. The predictive model must prove itself anew on each row of the terminal
       and after each control character, so <b>mosh</b> avoids echoing passwords or non-echoing editor commands.

       By default, <b>mosh</b> shows its predictions only  on  high-latency  connections  and  to  smooth  out  network
       glitches.  (On  longer-latency  links, the predicted cells are underlined until confirmed by the server.)
       Occasional echo mistakes are corrected within a network round-trip and do not cause lasting effect.

       <b>mosh</b> does not support X forwarding or the non-interactive uses  of  SSH,  including  port  forwarding  or
       sshfs.  <b>mosh</b>  works  through  typical  client-side  network  address translators but requires UDP to pass
       between client and server. By default, <b>mosh</b> uses the ports between 60000 and 61000, but allows  the  user
       to request a particular UDP port instead.

       Currently,  <b>mosh</b>  has limited support for IPv6, dual-stack networks, and servers with multiple addresses.
       At session start, it will select a single IPv4 or IPv6 server address to connect to for the  lifetime  of
       the session.

       <b>mosh</b>  will  do its best to arrange a UTF-8 character set locale on the client and server. The client must
       have locale-related environment variables that specify UTF-8. <b>mosh</b> will pass these  client  variables  to
       the  <b>mosh-server</b>  on its command line, but in most cases they will not need to be used. <b>mosh-server</b> first
       attempts to use its own  locale-related  environment  variables,  which  come  from  the  system  default
       configuration  (sometimes <a href="file:/etc/default/locale">/etc/default/locale</a>) or from having been passed over the SSH connection. But if
       these variables don't call for the use of UTF-8, <b>mosh-server</b> will apply  the  locale-related  environment
       variables from the client and try again.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options named  <b>--experimental-*</b> are subject to change or removal in future versions of Mosh; their design
       or function is not yet final.

       <u>command</u>
              Command to run on remote host. By default, <b>mosh</b> executes a login shell.

       <b>--client=</b><u>PATH</u>
              path to client helper on local machine (default: "mosh-client")

       <b>--server=</b><u>COMMAND</u>
              command to run server helper on remote machine (default: "mosh-server")

              The server helper is unprivileged and can be installed in the user's home directory.

              This option can be used to set environment variables for the server by using the <b><a href="../man1/env.1.html">env</a></b>(1) command to
              wrap the actual server command.  See <b><a href="../man1/mosh-server.1.html">mosh-server</a></b>(1) for available environment variables.

       <b>--ssh=</b><u>COMMAND</u>
              OpenSSH command to remotely execute mosh-server on remote machine (default: "ssh")

              An alternate ssh port can be specified with, <u>e.g.</u>, --ssh="ssh -p 2222".

       <b>--ssh-pty</b>
              <b>--no-ssh-pty</b>  Enable  or disable ssh's use of a pty when connecting to a remote host.  The default
              is enabled.

       <b>--predict=</b><u>WHEN</u>
              Controls use of speculative local echo. WHEN defaults to `adaptive' (show  predictions  on  slower
              links and to smooth out network glitches) and can also be `always` or `never'.

              The  MOSH_PREDICTION_DISPLAY  environment variable controls this setting permanently and can adopt
              the same three values.

              Even on `always', <b>mosh</b> will only show predictions when it is confident.  This  generally  means  a
              previous  prediction on the same row of the terminal has been confirmed by the server, without any
              intervening control character keystrokes.

       <b>-a</b>     Synonym for --predict=always

       <b>-n</b>     Synonym for --predict=never

       <b>--predict-overwrite</b>
              When prediction is enabled, do not  insert  speculative  local  echo  before  existing  text,  but
              overwrite it instead.

              The MOSH_PREDICTION_OVERWRITE environment variable also enables this if its value is 'yes'.

       <b>-o</b>     Synonym for --predict-overwrite

       <b>--family=inet</b>
              Only use IPv4 for the SSH connection and Mosh session.

       <b>--family=inet6</b>
              Only  use  IPv6  for  the  SSH  connection and Mosh session.  This and the following modes require
              Perl's IO::Socket::IP or IO::Socket::INET6 modules.

       <b>--family=auto</b>
              Autodetect IPv4 or IPv6 for hosts that only have addresses in a single family.   Hosts  with  both
              IPv4  and  IPv6  addresses  will  raise  an  error, and require re-invocation of <b>mosh</b> with another
              <b>--family</b> option.

       <b>--family=all</b>
              Choose an address from all available IPv4 or IPv6 address, even for dual-stack hosts.  This is the
              most convenient option, but requires dual-stack connectivity, and  Mosh  1.2.5  or  later  on  the
              server, when roaming with dual-stack servers.

       <b>--family=prefer-inet</b>
              Similar to <b>--family=all</b>, but attempt connects to the IPv4 addresses first.  This is the default.

       <b>--family=prefer-inet6</b>
              Similar to <b>--family=all</b>, but attempt connects to the IPv6 addresses first.

       <b>-4</b>     Synonym for --family=inet

       <b>-6</b>     Synonym for --family=inet6

       <b>-p</b> <u>PORT</u><b>[:</b><u>PORT2</u><b>],</b> <b>--port=</b><u>PORT</u><b>[:</b><u>PORT2</u><b>]</b>
              Use a particular server-side UDP port or port range, for example, if this is the only port that is
              forwarded  through  a  firewall to the server. With <b>-p</b> <b>0</b>, the server will let the operating system
              pick an available UDP port. Otherwise, <b>mosh</b> will choose a port between  60000  and  61000.  Please
              note that this option does not affect the server-side port used by SSH.

       <b>--bind-server={ssh|any|</b><u>IP</u><b>}</b>
              Control the IP address that the <b>mosh-server</b> binds to.

              The  default  is  `ssh',  in  which  case  the  server will reply from the IP address that the SSH
              connection came from (as found in the <b>SSH_CONNECTION</b> environment variable).  This  is  useful  for
              multihomed servers.

              With  --bind-server=any,  the  server  will  reply on the default interface and will not bind to a
              particular IP address. This can be useful if the connection is made through <b>sslh</b> or  another  tool
              that makes the SSH connection appear to come from localhost.

              With --bind-server=<u>IP</u>, the server will attempt to bind to the specified IP address.

       <b>--no-init</b>
              Do  not  send  the  <b>smcup</b>  initialization string and <b>rmcup</b> deinitialization string to the client's
              terminal. On many terminals this disables alternate screen mode.

       <b>--local</b>
              Invoke <b>mosh-server</b> locally, without using <b>ssh</b>.  This option requires the <b>host</b>  argument  to  be  a
              local, numeric IPv4/IPv6 address.  This option is useful for testing.

       <b>--experimental-remote-ip={proxy|local|remote}</b>
              Select the method used to discover the IP address that the <b>mosh-client</b> connects to.

              The default is <b>proxy</b>, which uses SSH's <b>--ssh-proxy-command</b> option to generate and report the exact
              address that <b>ssh</b> uses to connect to the remote host.  This option is generally the most compatible
              with  hosts  and  other options configured in <b>ssh</b> configuration files.  However, this may not work
              for some configurations, or for environments where  a  <b>ssh</b>  bastion  host  forwards  to  a  remote
              machine.  It only works with <b>OpenSSH</b>.

              With  <b>remote</b>,  the  server's <b>SSH_CONNECTION</b> environment variable will be used.  This is useful for
              environments where <b>ssh</b> forwarding is used, or the <b>--ssh-proxy-command</b> option  is  used  for  other
              purposes.

              With  <b>local</b>,  Mosh resolves the hostname given on its command line, and uses that address for both
              <b>ssh</b> and Mosh connections.  This option ignores  any  configuration  in  <b>ssh_config</b>  for  the  same
              hostname.

</pre><h4><b>ESCAPE</b> <b>SEQUENCES</b></h4><pre>
       The default escape character used by Mosh is ASCII RS (decimal 30).  This is typically typed as <b>Ctrl-^</b> or
       <b>Ctrl-Shift-6</b>,  on  US  English  keyboards.   Users  of  non-English  keyboards  may  find it difficult or
       impossible to type the default escape character, and may need to change the escape  character.   See  the
       description  of  MOSH_ESCAPE_KEY,  below.   In  this  description,  the  configured  escape  character is
       represented as <b>Esc</b>.

       There are two slightly different modes for escape sequences, depending whether the  escape  character  is
       printable or not.

       If the escape character is a printable character, it must be prefixed with a newline, similar to <b>OpenSSH</b>.
       To  send  the  escape  character  itself,  type it twice.  If the escape character is set to <b>~</b>, <b>mosh</b> will
       behave much like <b>OpenSSH</b>.

       If the escape character is a non-printable control character, no prefix is used and the escape  character
       is  recognized  at  any  time.   To send the escape character itself, type the escape character, then its
       corresponding ASCII character (for <b>Ctrl-^</b> you would type <b>^</b>, for <b>Ctrl-B</b> you would type <b>B</b>).

       The escape sequence to shut down the connection is <b>Esc</b> <b>.</b>. The sequence <b>Esc</b> <b>Ctrl-Z</b>  suspends  the  client.
       Any other sequence passes both characters through to the server.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       These variables are not actually interpreted by <b><a href="../man1/mosh.1.html">mosh</a></b>(1) itself, but are passed through to <b><a href="../man1/mosh-server.1.html">mosh-server</a></b>(1).
       They are described here for ease of use.

       <b>MOSH_ESCAPE_KEY</b>
              When  set, this configures the escape character used for local commands.  The escape character may
              be set to any ASCII character in the range 1-127.  The variable must be set with a single  literal
              ASCII  character.   Control characters are set with the actual ASCII control character, not with a
              printable representation such as "^B".

       <b>MOSH_PREDICTION_DISPLAY</b>
              Controls local echo as described above.  The command-line flag overrides this variable.

       <b>MOSH_TITLE_NOPREFIX</b>
              When set, inhibits prepending "[mosh]" to window title.
