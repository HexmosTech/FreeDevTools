</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       anki - flexible, intelligent flashcard program

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Anki</b>  is  a program designed to help you remember facts (such as words and phrases in a foreign language)
       as easily, quickly and efficiently as possible.  To do this, it tracks how well you remember  each  fact,
       and  uses  that  information to optimally schedule review times. With a minimal amount of effort, you can
       greatly increase the amount of material you remember, making study more productive, and more fun.

       Anki is based on a theory called <u>spaced</u> <u>repetition</u>. In simple terms, it means that each time  you  review
       some  material,  you should wait longer than last time before reviewing it again. This maximizes the time
       spent studying difficult material and minimizes the time spent reviewing things  you  already  know.  The
       concept is simple, but the vast majority of memory trainers and flashcard programs out there either avoid
       the  concept  all  together, or implement inflexible and suboptimal methods that were originally designed
       for pen and paper.
