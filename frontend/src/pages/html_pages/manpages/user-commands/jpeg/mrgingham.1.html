         [ image pops up with the detected grid plotted on top, detections color-coded
           by their decimation level ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The mrgingham tool detects chessboard corners from images stored on disk. The images are given on the
       commandline, as globs. Each glob is expanded, and each image is processed, possibly in parallel if -j was
       given.

       The output is a vnlog text table (&lt;https://www.github.com/dkogan/vnlog)&gt; containing columns:

       - filename: path to the image on disk

       - x, y: detected pixel coordinates of the chessboard corner

       - level: image level used in detecting this corner. Level 0 means "full-resolution". Level 1 means "half-
       resolution" and that the noise on this detection has double the standard deviation. Level 2 means
       "quarter-resolution" and so on.

       If no chessboard was found in an image, a single record is output:

         filename - - -

       The corners are output in a consistent order: starting at the top-left, traversing the grid, in the
       horizontal direction first. Usually, the chessboard is observed by multiple cameras mounted at a similar
       orientation, so this consistent order is consistent across cameras.

       By default we look for a CHESSBOARD, not a grid of circles or Apriltags or anything else. By default we
       apply adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE), then blur with a radius of 1. We then use an adaptive
       level of downsampling when looking for the chessboard. These defaults work very well in practice.

       For debugging, pass in --debug. This will dump the various intermediate results into <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> and it will
       report more stuff on the console. Most of the intermediate results are self-plotting data files. Run
       them. For debugging sequence candidates, pass in --debug-sequence x,y where 'x,y' are the approximate
       image coordinates of the start of a given sequence (corner on the edge of a chessboard. This doesn't need
       to be exact; mrgingham will report on the nearest corner

       See the mrgingham project documentation for more detail:

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>POSITIONAL</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b>
         imageglobs
           Globs specifying the images to process. May be given more than once

   <b>OPTIONAL</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b>
         --blobs
           Finds circle centers instead of chessboard corners. Not recommended
         --gridn N
           Requests detections of an NxN grid of corners. If omitted, N defaults to 10
         --noclahe
           Controls image preprocessing. Unless given, we will apply adaptive histogram
           equalization (CLAHE algorithm) to the images. This is EXTREMELY helpful if
           the images aren't illuminated evenly; which applies to most real-world
           images.
         --blur RADIUS
           Controls image preprocessing. Applies a gaussian blur to the image after the
           histogram equalization. A light blurring is very helpful with CLAHE, since
           it produces noisy images. By default we will blur with radius = 1. Set to &lt;=
           0 to disable
         --level LEVEL
           Controls image preprocessing. Applies a downsampling to the image (after
           CLAHE and --blur, if those are given). Level 0 means 'use the original
           image'. Level &gt; 0 means downsample by 2**level. Level &lt; 0 means 'try several
           different levels until we find one that works. This is the default.
         --no-refine
           Disables corner refinement. By default, the coordinates of reported corners
           are re-detected at less-downsampled zoom levels to improve their accuracy.
           If we do not want to do that, pass --no-refine
         --jobs N
           Parallelizes the processing N-ways. -j is a synonym. This is just like GNU
           make, except you're required to explicitly specify a job count.
         --debug
           If given, mrgingham will dump various intermediate results into <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> and it
           will report more stuff on the console. The output is self-documenting
         --debug-sequence
           If given, we report details about sequence matching. Do this if --debug
           reports correct-looking corners (all corners detected, no doubled-up
           detections, no detections inside the chessboard but not on a corner)
