       db5.3_archive - Find unused log files for archiving purposes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>db5.3_archive</b> [-adlsVv] [-h home] [-P password]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  db5.3_archive  utility  writes the pathnames of log files that are no longer in use (for example, no
       longer involved in active transactions), to the standard output, one pathname per line.  These log  files
       should be written to backup media to provide for recovery in the case of catastrophic failure (which also
       requires  a snapshot of the database files), but they may then be deleted from the system to reclaim disk
       space.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b>     Write all pathnames as absolute pathnames, instead of relative to the database home directories.

       <b>-d</b>     Remove log files that are no longer needed; no filenames are written.  Automatic log file  removal
              is likely to make catastrophic recovery impossible.

       <b>-h</b>     Specify  a  home directory for the database environment; by default, the current working directory
              is used.

       <b>-l</b>     Write out the pathnames of all the database log files, whether or not they are involved in  active
              transactions.

       <b>-P</b>     Specify  an  environment  password.   Although Berkeley DB utilities overwrite password strings as
              soon as possible, be aware there may be a window of vulnerability on  systems  where  unprivileged
              users  can  see  command-line  arguments  or  where utilities are not able to overwrite the memory
              containing the command-line arguments.

       <b>-s</b>     Write the pathnames of all the database files that need to be archived in  order  to  recover  the
              database  from  catastrophic  failure.  If any of the database files have not been accessed during
              the lifetime of the current log files, db5.3_archive will not include them in this output.

              It is possible that some of the files to which the log refers have since  been  deleted  from  the
              system.   In  this  case, db5.3_archive will ignore them.  When db5.3_recover is run, any files to
              which the log refers that are not present during recovery are assumed to  have  been  deleted  and
              will not be recovered.

       <b>-V</b>     Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.

       <b>-v</b>     Run in verbose mode, listing the checkpoints in the log files as they are reviewed.

       Log  cursor  handles  (returned  by the DB_ENV-&gt;log_cursor method) may have open file descriptors for log
       files in the database environment.  Also, the Berkeley DB interfaces to the database environment  logging
       subsystem  (for  example,  DB_ENV-&gt;log_put and DB_TXN-&gt;abort) may allocate log cursors and have open file
       descriptors for log files as well.  On operating systems  where  filesystem  related  system  calls  (for
       example,  rename  and  unlink  on  Windows/NT)  can fail if a process has an open file descriptor for the
       affected file, attempting to move or remove the log files listed by db5.3_archive may fail.  All Berkeley
       DB internal use of log cursors operates on active log files  only  and  furthermore,  is  short-lived  in
       nature.  So, an application seeing such a failure should be restructured to close any open log cursors it
       may  have, and otherwise to retry the operation until it succeeds.  (Although the latter is not likely to
       be necessary; it is hard to imagine a reason to move or rename a log file in which transactions are being
       logged or aborted.)

       The db5.3_archive utility uses a Berkeley DB environment (as described for the <b>-h</b> option, the environment
       variable <b>DB_HOME</b>, or because the utility was run in a directory containing a  Berkeley  DB  environment).
       In  order  to  avoid  environment  corruption  when using a Berkeley DB environment, db5.3_archive should
       always be given the chance to detach from the environment and exit gracefully.  To cause db5.3_archive to
       release all environment resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal (SIGINT).

       The DB_ENV-&gt;log_archive method is the underlying method used  by  the  db5.3_archive  utility.   See  the
       db5.3_archive  utility  source code for an example of using DB_ENV-&gt;log_archive in a IEEE/ANSI Std 1003.1
       (POSIX) environment.

       The db5.3_archive utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DB_HOME</b>
              If the <b>-h</b> option is not specified and the environment variable DB_HOME is set, it is used  as  the
              path of the database home, as described in DB_ENV-&gt;open.
