       ttcn3_logformat - TTCN-3 log file formatter utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ttcn3_logformat</b> [ <b>-i</b> <u>n</u> ] [ <b>-o</b> <u>outfile</u> ] [ <b>-s</b> ] [ <u>file.log</u> ] [ <b>-n</b> ]
       or
       <b>ttcn3_logformat</b> <b>-v</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page is a quick reference for the TTCN-3 logformat utility of the TTCN-3 Test Executor. The
       <b>ttcn3_logformat</b> utility, which can be found in <u>$TTCN3_DIR/bin,</u> reads the unformatted log  file  generated
       by  test  executor from its standard input. It can split up the log into several files based on the lines
       that are automatically logged at the beginning or end of each  test  case.  Furthermore,  <b>ttcn3_logformat</b>
       formats the sent and received messages in the log file. The structured values are indented and each field
       is put into a new line according to the braces and commas.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Available command line switches are:

       <b>-i</b> <u>n</u>      Sets  the  depth of each indentation level to <u>n</u> characters. The default value is 4. If the sent
                 or received PDU is too complex and has too deeply nested fields, this number can  be  decreased
                 to get more readable output.

       <b>-o</b> <u>outfile</u>
                 Places  the  output  into file <u>outfile</u>. If the <u>-s</u> flag is also set, only those parts of the log
                 files will be written into this file that were logged outside the test cases (i.e.  in  control
                 part  or  on  PTCs).   If this option is omitted, the formatted log will be printed to standard
                 output.

       <b>-s</b>        If this option is set, the entries that were recorded during the execution of a particular test
                 case will be saved in a separate file in <u>ttcn3_logformat</u> working directory. The  name  of  this
                 file  will be identical to the name of the test case. If the same test case is executed several
                 times after each other, the results of repeated test runs will be collected after  each  other.
                 If  the output file contained some data before <u>ttcn3_logformat</u> was started (e.g. the results of
                 previous test run), the output file will be emptied and the old logs will be destroyed.
                 <u>ttcn3_logformat</u> recognizes any types of timestamps that can be set in the <b>[LOGGING]</b> section  of
                 the configuration file.

                 <b>WARNING!</b>   This  option is useless when formatting the log files of PTCs, because these logs do
                 not contain the name of the testcase that the PTC belongs to.

       <b>-n</b>        If this option is set, newline and tab characters are not modified, they are printed as \n  and
                 \t

       <b>-v</b>        Prints <u>version</u> and license key information and exits.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       TTCN3_DIR
              The  installation  directory  where the uncompressed binary package of TTCN-3 Test Executor can be
              found.

       TTCN3_LICENSE_FILE
              It shall point to the <u>file</u> (<b>NB:</b> <u>not</u> to its directory) that contains the personalized  license  key
              for the current user or host.
