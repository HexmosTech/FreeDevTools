</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sos</b>  <b>clean</b>  or  <b>sos</b>  <b>mask</b>  is  an  sos subcommand used to obfuscate sensitive information from previously
       generated sos reports that is not covered by the standard plugin-based post  processing  executed  during
       report generation, for example IP addresses.

       Data  obfuscated  via  this  utility  is  done  so  consistently,  meaning  for  example an IP address of
       192.168.1.1 in an unprocessed sos report that gets obfuscated to, for example, 100.0.0.1, will be changed
       to 100.0.0.1 in all occurrences found in the report.

       Additionally, by default all such obfuscations are stored in "maps" that will be  persistently  saved  to
       /etc/sos/cleaner/default_mapping and be re-used on subsequent runs.

       This  utility  may  also  be  used  in-line with <b>sos</b> <b>report</b> and  <b>sos</b> <b>collect</b> by specifying the <b>--clean</b> or
       <b>--mask</b> option.

       When called directly via <b>sos</b> <b>clean</b>, the obfuscated archive is written as an additional file, meaning  the
       original  unprocessed  report  still  remains  on  the filesystem. When called via <b>report</b> or <b>collect</b>, the
       changes are done in-line and thus only an obfuscated archive is written and available.  In either case, a
       mapping file containing the relationships between unprocessed and obfuscated elements will be written  in
       the  same  location  as  the  resulting  archive.  This  mapping  file  should  be kept private by system
       administrators.

</pre><h4><b>REQUIRED</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>TARGET</b>

       The path to the archive that is to be obfuscated. This may be an archive or an unbuilt sos temporary
              directory. If an archive, it will first be extracted and then after obfuscation  is  complete  re-
              compressed using the same compression method as the original.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--domains</b> <b>DOMAINS</b>
              Provide  a  comma-delimited  list  of domain names to obfuscate, in addition to those matching the
              hostname of the system that created the sos report. Subdomains that match a domain given via  this
              option will also be obfuscated.

              For  example,  if <b>--domains</b> <b>redhat.com</b> is specified, then 'redhat.com' will be obfuscated, as will
              'www.redhat.com' and subdomains such as 'foo.redhat.com'.

       <b>--disable-parsers</b> <b>PARSERS</b>
              Provide a comma-delimited list of parsers to disable when cleaning  an  archive.  By  default  all
              parsers are enabled.

              Note  that  using this option is very likely to leave sensitive information in place in the target
              archive, so only use this option when absolutely necessary or  you  have  complete  trust  in  the
              party/parties that may handle the generated report.

              Valid values for this option are currently: <b>hostname</b>, <b>ip</b>, <b>ipv6</b>, <b>mac</b>, <b>keyword</b>, and <b>username</b>.

       <b>--skip-cleaning-files,</b> <b>--skip-masking-files</b> <b>FILES</b>
              Provide a comma-delimited list of files inside an archive, that cleaner should skip in cleaning.

              Globs  like  asterisk  are  supported,  so  <b>sos_commands/host/hostname*</b> will match all three usual
              filenames in that directory (<b>hostname</b>, <b>hostnamectl_status</b> and <b>hostname_-f</b>).

              Use this option with caution, only when being certain the given files do not contain any sensitive
              information.

       <b>--keywords</b> <b>KEYWORDS</b>
              Provide a comma-delimited list of keywords to scrub in addition to the default parsers.

              Keywords provided by this option will be obfuscated as "obfuscatedwordX" where  X  is  an  integer
              based on the keyword's index in the parser. Note that keywords will be replaced as both standalone
              words and in substring matches.

       <b>--keyword-file</b> <b>FILE</b>
              Provide  a  file  that  contains  a  list of keywords that should be obfuscated. Each word must be
              specified on a newline within the file.

       <b>--map-file</b> <b>FILE</b>
              Provide a location to a valid mapping file to use as a reference for existing  obfuscation  pairs.
              If  one  is  found,  the  contents  are  loaded before parsing is started. This allows consistency
              between runs of this command for obfuscated pairs.  By  default,  sos  will  write  the  generated
              private map file to /etc/sos/cleaner/default_mapping so that consistency is maintained by default.
              Users  may use this option to reference a map file from a different run (perhaps one that was done
              on another system).

              Default: /etc/sos/cleaner/default_mapping

       <b>--jobs</b> <b>JOBS</b>
              The number of concurrent archives to process, if more than one. If this utility is called  by  <b>sos</b>
              <b>collect</b> then the value of the jobs option for that utility will be used here.

              Default: 4

       <b>--no-update</b>
              Do not write the mapping file contents to /etc/sos/cleaner/default_mapping

       <b>--keep-binary-files</b>
              Keep unprocessable binary files in the archive, rather than removing them.

              Note  that  binary  files cannot be obfuscated, and thus keeping them in the archive may result in
              otherwise sensitive information being included in the final  archive.   Users  should  review  any
              archive that keeps binary files in place before sending to a third party.

              Default: False (remove encountered binary files)

       <b>--archive-type</b> <b>TYPE</b>
              Specify  the type of archive that TARGET was generated as.  When sos inspects a TARGET archive, it
              tries to identify what type of archive it is.  For example, it may be a report  generated  by  <b>sos</b>
              <b>report</b>,  or  a  collection  of  those  reports  generated  by  <b>sos</b> <b>collect</b>, which require separate
              approaches.

              This option may be useful if a given TARGET archive is known to be of a specific type, but due  to
              unknown  reasons  or  some  malformed/missing  information  in  the  archive directly, that is not
              properly identified by sos.

              The following are accepted values for this option:

                  <b>auto</b>          Automatically detect the archive type
                  <b>report</b>        An archive generated by <b>sos</b> <b>report</b>
                  <b>collect</b>       An archive generated by <b>sos</b> <b>collect</b>
                  <b>insights</b>      An archive generated by the <b>insights-client</b> package

              The following may also be used, however note that these do not attempt to pre-load any information
              from the archives into the parsers. This means that, among other limitations, items like host  and
              domain  names may not be obfuscated unless an obfuscated mapping already exists on the system from
              a previous execution.

                  <b>data-dir</b>      A plain directory on the filesystem.
                  <b>tarball</b>       A generic tar archive not associated with any known tool
