</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The script is designed to assist in the setup of the <a href="../man8/lirc.8.html">lirc</a>(8)  configuration  files  for  ordinary  remote
       controls.  It is not aimed to handle full-blown keyboards or joystick devices. The generated lircrc files
       represents a starting point which will need further, manual refinements but might "work" in a basic sense
       in many cases.

       The setup involves normalizing the lircd.conf to use symbols  in  the  legal  namespace,  and  to  create
       application specific lircrc files which uses the normalized symbols.

       To assist normalizing /etc/lircd.conf, the script can report symbols used which not are in the namespace.
       It can can also update many of these symbols to corresponding symbols within the namespace.

       The script also can create application specific lircrc files such as mythtv.lircrc or vlc.lircrc. It then
       uses  the normalized key symbols in /etc/lirdc.conf. By default, files are created in <a href="file:~/.config/lirc.">~/.config/lirc.</a>

       Generated  lircrc files basically combines known keys from /etc/lirc/lircd.conf with template data for an
       application. The process results in a lircrc file, a list a of unused keys and some entries  which  don't
       match  any existing key. The unused keys and unmatched entries are written as comments into the generated
       file.

       An 'illegal' key i. e., a key not in namespace, will not match any entry and will thus always be  unused.
       However, it's perfectly possible to use it later on while manually modifying the lircrc files.

       When updating files, script always makes backup copies.

       The  generated  lircrc  files are intended to be included in a main <a href="file:~/.config/lircrc">~/.config/lircrc</a> file. A minimal such
       might look like

                  include <a href="file:~/.config/lirc/mythtv.lircrc">~/.config/lirc/mythtv.lircrc</a>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Scan /etc/lirc/lircd.conf for duplicated symbols and symbols not in namespace:

              lirc-config-tool -s

       Update a local lircd.conf file to use symbols in namespace:

              lirc-config-tool -uc ./lircd.conf

       List available files to generate:

              lirc-config-tool -l

       Generate one of the files listed by -l, creates <a href="file:~/.config/lirc/mythtv.lircrc">~/.config/lirc/mythtv.lircrc</a>:

              lirc-config-tool mythtv

       Dump template data  for mythtv:

              lirc-config-tool -d mythtv &gt;mythtv.lircdata

       Use possibly edited data to create a modified mythtv.lircrc in current dir:

              lirc-config-tool -o . stdin &lt; mythtv.lircdata

</pre><h4><b>LIRCD.CONF</b> <b>CONVERSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The -s option simply reports all key symbols not  in  namespace.  It  also  reports  some  symbols  which
       although  legal  are  inappropriate  in  this  context, notably KEY_NUMERIC_0..KEY_NUMERIC_9. If present,
       duplicated keys are also reported.

       The -u option converts several known symbols to their corresponding KEY_*  symbols.  Symbols  which  have
       names like KEY_WINDOWS but not are in namespace gets a X_ prefix e. g., KEY_WINDOWS -&gt; X_KEY_WINDOWS. The
       converted file thus guarantees that any key symbol starting with KEY_ is a legal symbol.

       All known numeric keys such as '1', 'KEY_1', 'KEY_KP_1', 'KEY_NUMERIC_1 are converted to KEY_1.

       All modifications are marked by comments in file.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDING</b></h4><pre>
       The  script  can be extended to support more applications by providing a shell function named *.lircdata.
       E. g., to add a new application named "my_app" based on the built-in vlc application:

                $ lirc-config-tool -d vlc &gt;my_app.lircdata
                $ function my_app_lircdata()
                &gt; {
                &gt;    cat my_app.lircdata
                &gt; }
                $ export -f my_app_lircdata
                $ lirc-config-tool  my_app

</pre><h4><b>DATA</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The script uses a simple, line-oriented format to represent the lircrc files.  The purpose of the  format
       is to be compact and thus to give a good overview, and also to be easy to parse.  Each line is divided in
       comma-separated tokens.  There are four kind of lines.

       Comment lines begins with a '#'. These are copied verbatim to the output file.

       The  first  data  line  represents  global items, applicable to all entrys. The first word is the program
       name. It's used in the first 'program=' line.  Following words, if present, are optional lines which will
       be appended to each entry in the file.

       A data line starting with 'begin' or 'end' is a  mode block designator. It's copied  verbatim  to  output
       file.

       All other data lines represents a button/config entry. The format is
           &lt;button&gt; &lt;config&gt; [extra]...
       The  button  value  is used in the  button = line, and the config item is used in the config = line. Both
       are mandatory. Following items, if any, are copied as verbatim lines to the entry.

       An unlikely example: The data format

           myprog, flags = quit
           begin volume_mode
           KEY_VOLUMEUP, volume-up, delay=4, repeat=1
           KEY_VOLUMEDOWN, volume-down
           end volume_mode

       translates to:

           begin volume_mode
               begin
                   program = myprog
                   button  = KEY_VOLUME_UP
                   config  = volume-up
                   delay   = 4
                   repeat  = 1
                   flags   = quit
               end
               begin
                   program = myprog
                   button  = KEY_VOLUME_DOWN
                   config  = volume-down
                   flags   = quit
               end
           end volume_mode
