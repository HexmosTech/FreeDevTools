</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       hcal - displays a Hebrew / Gregorian calendar

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hcal</b> [options] [coordinates [timezone]] [[mm] yyyy]

       coordinates: -l [NS]yy[.yyy] -L [EW]xx[.xxx]
                           -l [NS]yy[:mm[:ss]] -L [EW]xx[:mm[:ss]]
              timezone:    -z nn[( .nn | :mm )]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hcal</b>  prints  a calendar with both Gregorian and Hebrew dates for the specified Gregorian month or, if no
       month is specified, for the whole Gregorian year. If no  arguments  are  given,  it  prints  the  current
       month's  calendar.  Jewish  holidays  are  annotated,  and can optionally be footnoted.  <b>hcal</b> tries to be
       sunset-aware in order to correctly highlight the current Hebrew date, and can also display Shabbat  times
       and parshiot. See the section LOCATION, below.

       <b>INPUTTING</b> <b>A</b> <b>HEBREW</b> <b>DATE:</b> If the year provided is greater than 3000, <b>hcal</b> will interpret the given date as
       a  Hebrew  date, and will display the calendar of the corresponding Gregorian month(s). Hebrew months are
       expected to be passed as numbers 1-12 for Tishrei - Elul; Adar I and Adar II are expected to be passed as
       months 13 and 14.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>HOLIDAYS</b>
       Holidays  are  depicted  by  a  change  in  the  symbol separating a day's Gregorian and Hebrew dates, as
       follows:

              <b>/</b>  Regular day
              <b>+</b>  Yom Tov (plus Yom Kippur)
              <b>*</b>  Erev Yom Kippur
              <b>~</b>  Hol HaMoed
              <b>!</b>   Hanuka and Purim
              <b>@</b>  Tzomot
              <b>$</b>  Lag BaOmer ,Tu BeAv, Tu BeShvat
              <b>#</b>  Independance day and Yom Yerushalaim
              <b>%</b>  Tzahal and Holocaust memorial days
              <b>^</b>  Other Israeli National days

       Use the -f (--footnote) option to have hcal describe what any particular day is marking.

   <b>LOCATIONS</b>
       If you want <b>hcal</b> to display accurate Shabbat times, and to accurately advance the Hebrew  'today's  date'
       indicator  at  sunset,  <b>hcal</b>  requires  location  and time zone information in order to make astronomical
       calculations for a given date. If you don't provide ANY such information, <b>hcal</b> uses your computer's local
       time zone information as an indicator, and either picks a city in that time  zone,  or  defaults  to  the
       equator  at  the  center  of  that time zone. If <b>hcal</b> can't even retrieve time zone information from your
       computer, it defaults to Tel-Aviv. For other locations, use the <b>-l</b> <b>-L</b> option pair. For  other  timezones,
       use the <b>-z</b> option. Co-ordinates and standard time zones for some common locations are listed below.

       The current defaults include:
                Timezone   Default city    Lattitude  Longitude
                   -5      New York City      40        -74
                    0      London             51          0
                    1      Paris              48          2
                    2      Tel-Aviv           32         34
                    3      Moscow             55         37

   <b>CONFIG</b> <b>FILE</b>
       This folder and file will be automatically created, and includes its own documentation, in-line:
                       <u>${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/hcal/hcalrc</u>

       If ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME} is undefined:
                       <u><a href="file:~/.config/hcal/hcalrc">~/.config/hcal/hcalrc</a></u>

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Accuracy</b>  The   accuracy  of  the  astronomically-derived  data  will  suffer  from  not  accounting  for
                 environmental conditions such as elevation, horizon, temperature and air pressure.

       <b>Timezones</b> The timezone support is currenlty  primitive  and  lacks  support  for  daylight  savings  time
                 transitions.

       <b>Historical</b>
                 The  software  does  not  yet  account  for  the phenomenon and complications of the "Gregorian
                 transition" from the prior, Julian calendar, which effectively caused an  instantaneous  'loss'
                 of  two weeks for all gentiles affected. Countries (eg. Poland, Spain and Italy) began adopting
                 the Gregorian calendar on 8 Tishrei 5343 (4 October 1582CE), although many did  not  transition
                 until  the  56th century (1752 CE, eg. UK colonies, Sweden). Russia did not adopt the Gregorian
                 calendar until 5678 (1918 CE) and Turkey did not until 5687 (December,  1926  CE).  Many  other
                 countries  made the transition on other dates. Keep in mind that Russia invaded part of Poland,
                 undoing, for the interim, the Gregorian  transition  for  (only)  that  part  of  Poland;  Also
                 important  to  remember  in  this  regard  is that Eretz Ysroel was part of the Turkish Ottoman
                 empire until the British mandate (5677 (1917CE)). Until all this is accounted for adequately by
                 this application, refer to ' <b>ncal</b> <b>-p</b> Â´ for a basic table of country transitions. However,  keep
                 in  mind  that European borders underwent many changes during the 426 years in question, so the
                 accuracy of your data will depend on accurate knowledge of whether any particular date  at  any
                 specific location was Julian or Gregorian.

       1. Display a 2012ce year's calendar, three-months wide, in color.
             <b>hcal</b> <b>-3c</b> <b>2012</b>

       2.  Display the current month's calendar, with Shabbat times, parshiot, footnoted holiday identification,
          with Hebrew information in Hebrew, and all in "calming", "muted" color-tones.
