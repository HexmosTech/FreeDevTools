</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dune-uninstall - Uninstall packages defined in the workspace.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       The installation directories used are defined by priority:
       - directories set on the command line of <u>dune</u> <u>install</u>, or corresponding environment variables
       - directories set in dune binary. They are setup before the compilation of dune with <u>./configure</u>
       - inferred from the environment variable <u>OPAM_SWITCH_PREFIX</u> if present

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--action-stderr-on-success</b>=<u>VAL</u>
           Same  as <b>--action-stdout-on-success</b> but for standard error instead of standard output. A good default
           for          large          mono-repositories          is          <b>--action-stdout-on-success=swallow</b>
           <b>--action-stderr-on-success=must-be-empty</b>.  This  ensures  that a successful build has a "clean" empty
           output.

       <b>--action-stdout-on-success</b>=<u>VAL</u>
           Specify how to deal with the standard output of actions when they succeed. Possible values are: <b>print</b>
           to just print it to Dune's output, <b>swallow</b> to completely ignore it and <b>must-be-empty</b> to enforce  that
           the  action  printed  nothing.  With  <b>must-be-empty</b>,  Dune will consider that the action failed if it
           printed something to its standard output. The default is <b>print</b>.

       <b>--bindir</b>=<u>PATH</u>
           Manually override the directory to install public binaries. Only absolute path accepted.

       <b>--build-info</b>
           Show build information.

       <b>--context</b>=<u>CONTEXT</u>
           Select context to install from. By default, install files from all defined contexts.

       <b>--create-install-files</b>
           Do not directly install, but create install files in the root directory and create substituted  files
           if needed in destdir (_destdir by default).

       <b>--datadir</b>=<u>PATH</u>
           Manually override the directory to install files from share section. Only absolute path accepted.

       <b>--destdir</b>=<u>PATH</u> (absent <b>DESTDIR</b> env)
           This directory is prepended to all installed paths.

       <b>--display-separate-messages</b>
           Separate error messages with a blank line.

       <b>--docdir</b>=<u>PATH</u>
           Manually override the directory to install documentation files. Only absolute path accepted.

       <b>--dry-run</b>
           Only display the file operations that would be performed.

       <b>--error-reporting</b>=<u>VAL</u> (absent=<b>deterministic</b>)
           Controls  when  the  build  errors are reported. <b>early</b> reports errors as soon as they are discovered.
           <b>deterministic</b> reports errors at the end of the build in a deterministic  order.  <b>twice</b>  reports  each
           error  twice:  once  as  soon as the error is discovered and then again at the end of the build, in a
           deterministic order.

       <b>--etcdir</b>=<u>PATH</u>
           Manually override the directory to install configuration files. Only absolute path accepted.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--force</b>
           Force actions associated to aliases to be re-executed even if their dependencies haven't changed.

       <b>--file-watcher</b>=<u>VAL</u> (absent=<b>automatic</b>)
           Mechanism to detect changes in the source. Automatic to make dune run an external program  to  detect
           changes. Manual to notify dune that files have changed manually.

       <b>--libdir</b>=<u>PATH</u>
           Directory  where  library  files are copied, relative to <b>prefix</b> or absolute. If <b>--prefix</b> is specified
           the default is <u>$prefix/lib</u>. Only absolute path accepted.

       <b>--libexecdir</b>=<u>PATH</u>
           Manually override the directory to install executable library files. Only absolute path accepted.

       <b>--mandir</b>=<u>PATH</u>
           Manually override the directory to install man pages. Only absolute path accepted.

       <b>--passive-watch-mode</b>
           Similar to [--watch], but only start a build when instructed externally by an RPC.

       <b>--prefix</b>=<u>PREFIX</u> (absent <b>DUNE_INSTALL_PREFIX</b> env)
           Directory where files are copied. For instance binaries are copied into  <u>$prefix/bin</u>,  library  files
           into <u>$prefix/lib</u>, etc...

       <b>--relocatable</b>
           Make  the  binaries relocatable (the installation directory can be moved). The installation directory
           must be specified with --prefix

       <b>--sandbox</b>=<u>VAL</u> (absent <b>DUNE_SANDBOX</b> env)
           Set sandboxing mode. Some actions require a  certain  sandboxing  mode,  so  they  will  ignore  this
           setting. The allowed values are: none, symlink, copy, hardlink.

       <b>--sbindir</b>=<u>PATH</u>
           Manually override the directory to install files from sbin section. Only absolute path accepted.

       <b>--sections</b>=<u>VAL</u>
           sections that should be installed

       <b>--stop-on-first-error</b>
           Stop the build as soon as an error is encountered.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--watch</b>
           Instead of terminating build after completion, wait continuously for file changes.

       <b>--wait-for-filesystem-clock</b>
           Dune  digest  file  contents  for  better incrementally. These digests are themselves cached. In some
           cases, Dune needs to drop some digest cache entries in order for things to be reliable.  This  option
           makes  Dune  wait  for the file system clock to advance so that it doesn't need to drop anything. You
           should probably not care about this option; it is mostly useful for  Dune  developers  to  make  Dune
           tests of the digest cache more reproducible.

</pre><h4><b>COMMON</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These options are common to all commands.

       <b>--always-show-command-line</b>
           Always show the full command lines of programs executed by dune.

       <b>--auto-promote</b>
           Automatically promote files. This is similar to running <b>dune</b> <b>promote</b> after the build.

       <b>--build-dir</b>=<u>FILE</u> (absent <b>DUNE_BUILD_DIR</b> env)
           Specified build directory. _build if unspecified

       <b>--cache</b>=<u>VAL</u> (absent <b>DUNE_CACHE</b> env)

           `enabled-except-user-rules'.

       <b>--cache-check-probability</b>=<u>VAL</u> (absent <b>DUNE_CACHE_CHECK_PROBABILITY</b> env)
           Check build reproducibility by re-executing randomly chosen rules and comparing  their  results  with
           those  stored  in  Dune  cache.  Note: by increasing the probability of such checks you slow down the
           build. The default probability is zero, i.e. no rules are checked.

       <b>--cache-storage-mode</b>=<u>VAL</u> (absent <b>DUNE_CACHE_STORAGE_MODE</b> env)
           Dune cache storage mode (one of <b>auto</b>, <b>hardlink</b> or <b>copy</b>). Default is `hardlink'.

       <b>--config-file</b>=<u>FILE</u>
           Load this configuration file instead of the default one.

       <b>--debug-artifact-substitution</b>
           Print debugging info about artifact substitution

           Always print exception backtraces.

       <b>--debug-cache</b>=<u>VAL</u>
           Show debug messages on cache misses for the given cache layers. Value is a  comma-separated  list  of
           cache layer names. All available cache layers: shared,workspace-local,fs.

       <b>--debug-dependency-path</b>
           In  case  of  error,  print the dependency path from the targets on the command line to the rule that
           failed.

       <b>--debug-digests</b>
           Explain why Dune decides to re-digest some files

       <b>--debug-load-dir</b>
           Print debugging info about directory loading

       <b>--debug-package-logs</b> (absent <b>DUNE_DEBUG_PACKAGE_LOGS</b> env)
           Always print the standard logs when building packages

       <b>--default-target</b>=<u>TARGET</u> (absent=<b>@@default</b>)
           Set the default target that is used when none is specified to <b>dune</b> <b>build</b>.

       <b>--diff-command</b>=<u>VAL</u> (absent <b>DUNE_DIFF_COMMAND</b> env)
           Shell command to use to diff files. Use - to disable printing the diff.

       <b>--disable-promotion</b> (absent <b>DUNE_DISABLE_PROMOTION</b> env)
           Disable all promotion rules

       <b>--display</b>=<u>MODE</u>
           Control the display mode of Dune. See <b><a href="../man5/dune-config.5.html">dune-config</a>(5)</b> for more details. Valid values for  this  option
           are progress, verbose, short, quiet or tui.

       <b>--dump-gc-stats</b>=<u>FILE</u>
           Dump the garbage collector stats to a file after the build is complete.

       <b>--dump-memo-graph</b>=<u>FILE</u>
           Dump the dependency graph to a file after the build is complete.

       <b>--dump-memo-graph-format</b>=<u>FORMAT</u> (absent=<b>gexf</b>)
           Set the file format used by <b>--dump-memo-graph</b>

       <b>--dump-memo-graph-with-timing</b>
           Re-run  each  cached node in the Memo graph after building and include the run duration in the output
           of <b>--dump-memo-graph</b>. Since all nodes contain a cached value, each measurement will only account  for
           a single node.

       <b>--help</b>[=<u>FMT</u>] (default=<b>auto</b>)
           Show  this  help  in format <u>FMT</u>. The value <u>FMT</u> must be one of <b>auto</b>, <b>pager</b>, <b>groff</b> or <b>plain</b>. With <b>auto</b>,
           the format is <b>pager</b> or <b>plain</b> whenever the <b>TERM</b> env var is <b>dumb</b> or undefined.

       <b>--ignore-lock-dir</b>
           Ignore dune.lock/ directory.

       <b>--ignore-promoted-rules</b>
           Ignore   rules   with   (mode   promote),   except   ones   with    (only    ...).    The    variable
           %{ignoring_promoted_rules} in dune files reflects whether this option was passed or not.

       <b>--instrument-with</b>=<u>BACKENDS</u> (absent <b>DUNE_INSTRUMENT_WITH</b> env)
           Enable  instrumentation by <b>BACKENDS</b>. <b>BACKENDS</b> is a comma-separated list of library names, each one of
           which must declare an instrumentation backend.

       <b>-j</b> <u>JOBS</u>
           Run no more than <u>JOBS</u> commands simultaneously.

       <b>--no-buffer</b>
           Do not buffer the output of commands executed  by  dune.  By  default  dune  buffers  the  output  of
           subcommands,  in  order  to  prevent  interleaving  when  multiple commands are executed in parallel.
           However, this can be an issue when debugging long running  tests.  With  <b>--no-buffer</b>,  commands  have
           direct  access to the terminal. Note that as a result their output won't be captured in the log file.
           You should use this option in conjunction with <b>-j</b> <b>1</b>, to avoid interleaving. Additionally  you  should
           use <b>--verbose</b> as well, to make sure that commands are printed before they are being executed.

       <b>--no-config</b>
           Do not load the configuration file

       <b>--no-print-directory</b>
           Suppress "Entering directory" messages.

       <b>--only-packages</b>=<u>PACKAGES</u>
           Ignore  stanzas referring to a package that is not in <b>PACKAGES</b>. <b>PACKAGES</b> is a comma-separated list of
           package names. Note that this has the same effect as deleting the relevant stanzas from  dune  files.
           It  is  mostly  meant for releases. During development, it is likely that what you want instead is to
           build a particular <b>&lt;package&gt;.install</b> target.

       <b>-p</b> <u>PACKAGES</u>, <b>--for-release-of-packages</b>=<u>PACKAGES</u> (required)
           Shorthand for <b>--release</b> <b>--only-packages</b> <b>PACKAGE</b>. You must use  this  option  in  your  <u>&lt;package&gt;.opam</u>
           files,  in  order to build only what's necessary when your project contains multiple packages as well
           as getting reproducible builds.

       <b>--print-metrics</b>
           Print out various performance metrics after every build.

       <b>--profile</b>=<u>VAL</u> (absent <b>DUNE_PROFILE</b> env)
           Select the build profile, for instance <b>dev</b> or <b>release</b>. The default is <b>dev</b>.

       <b>--promote-install-files</b>[=<u>VAL</u>] (default=<b>true</b>)
           Promote any generated &lt;package&gt;.install files to the source tree.

       <b>--release</b>
           Put <b>dune</b> into a reproducible <u>release</u> mode. Shorthand for <b>--root</b> <b>.</b> <b>--ignore-promoted-rules</b> <b>--no-config</b>
           <b>--profile</b>  <b>release</b>  <b>--always-show-command-line</b>  <b>--promote-install-files</b>   <b>--require-dune-project-file</b>
           <b>--ignore-lock-dir</b>  <b>--default-target</b>  <b>@install</b>.  You  should  use  this option for release builds. For
           instance, you must use this option in your <u>&lt;package&gt;.opam</u> files. Except if you already use <b>-p</b>, as  <b>-p</b>
           implies this option.

       <b>--require-dune-project-file</b>[=<u>VAL</u>] (default=<b>true</b>)
           Fail if a dune-project file is missing.

       <b>--root</b>=<u>DIR</u>
           Use this directory as workspace root instead of guessing it. Note that this option doesn't change the
           interpretation of targets given on the command line. It is only intended for scripts.

       <b>--store-orig-source-dir</b> (absent <b>DUNE_STORE_ORIG_SOURCE_DIR</b> env)
           Store original source location in dune-package metadata.

       <b>--terminal-persistence</b>=<u>MODE</u>
           Change  how  the  log of build results are displayed to the console between rebuilds while in <b>--watch</b>
           mode. Supported modes: <b>preserve</b>, <b>clear-on-rebuild</b>, <b>clear-on-rebuild-and-flush-history</b>.

       <b>--trace-extended</b>
           Output extended trace data (requires trace-file).

       <b>--trace-file</b>=<u>FILE</u>
           Output trace data in catapult format (compatible with chrome://tracing).

       <b>--verbose</b>
           Same as <b>--display</b> <b>verbose</b>

       <b>--version</b>
           Show version information.

       <b>--watch-exclusions</b>=<u>REGEX</u>
           Adds a POSIX regular expression that will exclude matching directories from <b>`dune</b> <b>build</b> <b>--watch`</b>. The
           option <b>--watch-exclusions</b> can be repeated to add multiple exclusions. Semicolons can be also used  as
           a  separator.  If  no exclusions are provided, then a standard set of exclusions is used; however, if
           <u>one</u> <u>or</u> <u>more</u> <b>--watch-exclusions</b> are used, <b>none</b> of the  standard  exclusions  are  used.  The  standard
           exclusions  are:  ^_opam  /_opam ^_esy /_esy ^\.#.* /\.#.* ~$ ^#[^#]*#$ /#[^#]*#$ ^4913$ /4913$ /.git
           /.hg :/windows

       <b>--workspace</b>=<u>FILE</u> (absent <b>DUNE_WORKSPACE</b> env)
           Use this specific workspace file instead of looking it up.

       <b>-x</b> <u>VAL</u>
           Cross-compile using this toolchain.

</pre><h4><b>MORE</b> <b>HELP</b></h4><pre>

           `enabled-except-user-rules'.

       <b>DUNE_CACHE_CHECK_PROBABILITY</b>
           Check  build  reproducibility  by re-executing randomly chosen rules and comparing their results with
           those stored in Dune cache. Note: by increasing the probability of such  checks  you  slow  down  the
