</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sip-install - build and install the sip project

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       sip-install [options]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sip-install</b> builds and installs a project.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Display a help message.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Display the SIP version number.

       <b>--deprecations-are-errors</b>
              The use of any deprecated feature is handled as an error rather than a warning.

       <b>--quiet</b>
              All progress messages are disabled.

       <b>--verbose</b>
              Verbose progress messages are enabled.

       <b>--abi-version</b> <b>M[.N]</b>
              The  version  number  of  the ABI of the <b>sip</b> module to target is <b>M.N</b>.  By default the latest major
              version is used.  If the minor version is not specified then the latest minor version of the major
              version is used.

       <b>--api-dir</b> <b>DIR</b>
              A QScintilla <b>.api</b> file is created in <b>DIR</b>.

       <b>--build-dir</b> <b>DIR</b>
              <b>DIR</b> is created as a build directory in which all generated files  will  be  created.   This  build
              directory  is  not  removed  after  the  build  has  been completed.  By default a temporary build
              directory is created which is removed after the build has been completed.

       <b>--concatenate</b> <b>N</b>
              The generated code is split into <b>N</b> files.  By default one file is generated for each  C  structure
              or C++ class.  Specifying a low value of <b>N</b> can significantly speed up the build of large projects.

       <b>--disable</b> <b>NAME</b>
              The  <b>NAME</b>  bindings  are  disabled  and  will not be built.  This option may be specified multiple
              times.  It is only available if the project contains multiple sets of bindings.

       <b>--disabled-feature</b> <b>TAG</b>
              The <b>TAG</b> feature tag is disabled.  This option may be specified multiple times.

       <b>--enable</b> <b>NAME</b>
              The <b>NAME</b> bindings are enabled and will be built.  Any associated configuration  tests  that  would
              normally  be  run to determine if the bindings should be built are suppressed.  This option may be
              specified multiple times.  It is only available if the project contains multiple sets of bindings.

       <b>--debug</b>
              A build with debugging symbols is performed.

       <b>--no-docstrings</b>
              The  generation  of  docstrings  that  describe  the  signature  of  all  functions,  methods  and
              constructors is disabled.

       <b>--no-distinfo</b>
              The creation of the <b>.dist-info</b> directory is disabled.

       <b>--pep484-pyi</b>
              The generation of Python type hints stub files is enabled.  These files contain a description of a
              module's API that is compliant with <u>PEP</u> <u>484</u>.

       <b>--protected-is-public</b>
              SIP  can  generate  code to provide access to protected C++ functions from Python.  On non-Windows
              platforms this code can be avoided  if  the  <b>protected</b>  keyword  is  redefined  as  <b>public</b>  during
              compilation.  This can result in a significant reduction in the size of a generated Python module.
              This  option  enables  the  redefinition  of  <b>protected</b> and is the default on all platforms except
              Windows.

       <b>--no-protected-is-public</b>
              This option disables the redefinition of <b>protected</b> to access protected C++ functions  from  Python
              and is the default on Windows.

       <b>--scripts-dir</b> <b>DIR</b>
              Any  project scripts will be installed in <b>DIR</b>.  If <b>DIR</b> is relative then it is taken as relative to
              the target directory.  By default the directory containing the Python interpreter is used.

       <b>--target-dir</b> <b>DIR</b>
              The project will be installed in <b>DIR</b>.  By default it is the <b>site-packages</b> directory of the  Python
              installation.

       <b>--tracing</b>
              Debugging  statements  that  trace  the execution of the bindings are automatically generated.  By
              default the statements are not generated.

                                                                                                  <u><a href="../man1/sip-install.1.html">sip-install</a></u>(1)
