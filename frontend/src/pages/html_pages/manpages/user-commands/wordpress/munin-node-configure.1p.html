</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       munin-node-configure - View and modify which plugins are enabled.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         munin-node-configure [options]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>munin-node-configure</b> reports which plugins are enabled on the current node, and suggest changes to this
       list.

       By default this program shows which plugins are activated on the system.

       If you specify "--suggest", it will present a table of plugins that will probably work (according to the
       plugins' autoconf command).

       If you specify "--snmp", followed by a list of hosts, it will present a table of SNMP plugins that they
       support.

       If you additionally specify "--shell", shell commands to install those same plugins will be printed.
       These can be reviewed or piped directly into a shell to install the plugins.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--help</b>
           Show this help page.

       <b>--version</b>
           Show version information.

       <b>--debug</b>
           Print debug information on the operations of "munin-node-configure".  This can be very verbose.

           All  debugging  output  is  printed  to  STDOUT, and each line is prefixed with '#'.  Only errors are
           printed to STDERR.

       <b>--pidebug</b>
           Plugin debug.  Sets the environment variable MUNIN_DEBUG to 1 so that plugins may enable debugging.

       <b>--config</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
           Override configuration file [/etc/munin/munin-node.conf]

       <b>--servicedir</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
           Override plugin directory [/etc/munin/plugins/]

       <b>--sconfdir</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
           Override plugin configuration directory [/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/]

       <b>--libdir</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
           Override plugin library [/usr/share/munin/plugins/]

       <b>--suggest</b>
           Suggest plugins that might be added or removed, instead of those that are currently enabled.

   <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       By default, "munin-node-configure" will print out a table summarising the results.

       <b>--shell</b>
           Instead of a table, print shell commands to install the new plugin suggestions.

           This implies "--suggest", unless "--snmp" was also enabled.  By  default,  it  will  not  attempt  to
           remove any plugins.

       <b>--remove-also</b>
           When "--shell" is enabled, also provide commands to remove plugins that are no longer applicable from
           the service directory.

   <b>PLUGIN</b> <b>SELECTION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>--families</b> <b>&lt;family,...&gt;</b>
           Override the list of families that will be used (auto, manual, contrib, snmpauto).  Multiple families
           can be specified as a comma-separated list, by repeating the "--families" option, or as a combination
           of the two.

           When listing installed plugins, the default families are 'auto', 'manual' and 'contrib'.  Only 'auto'
           plugins are checked for suggestions.  SNMP probing is only performed on 'snmpauto' plugins.

       <b>--newer</b> <b>&lt;version&gt;</b>
           Only consider plugins added to the Munin core since &lt;version&gt;.  This option is useful when upgrading,
           since  it  can  prevent  plugins  that  have been manually removed from being reinstalled.  This only
           applies to plugins in the 'auto' family.

   <b>SNMP</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--snmp</b> <b>&lt;host|cidr,...&gt;</b>
           Probe the SNMP agents on the host or CIDR network (e.g. "192.168.1.0/24"), to see what  plugins  they
           support. This may take some time, especially if the many hosts are specified.

           This  option  can be specified multiple times, or as a comma-separated list, to include more than one
           host/CIDR.

       <b>--snmpversion</b> <b>&lt;ver&gt;</b>
           The SNMP version (1, 2c or 3) to use. ['2c']

       <b>--snmpport</b> <b>&lt;port&gt;</b>
           The SNMP port to use [161]

       <b>--snmpdomain</b> <b>&lt;domain&gt;</b>
           The Transport Domain to use for exchanging SNMP messages. The default is UDP/IPv4.  Possible  values:
           'udp', 'udp4', 'udp/ipv4'; 'udp6', 'udp/ipv6'; 'tcp', 'tcp4', 'tcp/ipv4'; 'tcp6', 'tcp/ipv6'.

       <b>SNMP</b> <b>1/2c</b> <b>authentication</b>
           SNMP  versions 1 and 2c use a "community string" for authentication.  This is a shared password, sent
           in plaintext over the network.

       <b>--snmpcommunity</b> <b>&lt;string&gt;</b>
           The community string for version 1 and 2c agents.  ['public'] (If this works your device is  probably
           very insecure and needs a security checkup).

       <b>SNMP</b> <b>3</b> <b>authentication</b>
           SNMP  v3  has  three security levels. Lowest is "noAuthNoPriv", which provides neither authentication
           nor encryption.  If a username and "authpassword" are given it  goes  up  to  "authNoPriv",  and  the
           connection  is authenticated.  If "privpassword" is also given the security level becomes "authPriv",
           and the connection is authenticated and encrypted.

           <b>Note</b>: Encryption can slow down slow or heavily loaded network devices.  For  most  uses  "authNoPriv"
           will be secure enough -- the password is sent over the network encrypted in any case.

           ContextEngineIDs are not (yet) supported.

           For  further  reading  on  SNMP  v3  security models please consult RFC3414 and the documentation for
           Net::SNMP.

       <b>--snmpusername</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>
           Username.  There is no default.

       <b>--snmpauthpass</b> <b>&lt;password&gt;</b>
           Authentication password.  Optional when encryption is also enabled, in which  case  defaults  to  the
           privacy password ("--snmpprivpass").

       <b>--snmpauthproto</b> <b>&lt;protocol&gt;</b>
           Authentication  protocol.   One  of  'md5' or 'sha' (HMAC-MD5-96, RFC1321 and SHA-1/HMAC-SHA-96, NIST
           FIPS PIB 180, RFC2264).  ['md5']

       <b>--snmpprivpass</b> <b>&lt;password&gt;</b>
           Privacy password to enable encryption.  There is no default.  An empty ('') password is considered as
           no password and will not enable encryption.

           Privacy requires a privprotocol as well as an authprotocol and a authpassword, but all of  these  are
           defaulted  (to  'des',  'md5',  and  the  privpassword value, respectively) and may therefore be left
           unspecified.

       <b>--snmpprivproto</b> <b>&lt;protocol&gt;</b>
           If the privpassword is set this setting controls what kind of encryption is used to  achieve  privacy
           in the session.  Only the very weak 'des' encryption method is supported officially.  ['des']

           munin-node-configure also supports '3des' (CBC-3DES-EDE, aka Triple-DES, NIST FIPS 46-3) as specified
           in IETF draft-reeder-snmpv3-usm-3desede.  Whether or not this works with any particular device, we do
           not know.
