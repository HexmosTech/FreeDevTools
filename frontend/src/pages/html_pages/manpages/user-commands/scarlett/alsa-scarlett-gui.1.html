</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
            <b>alsa-scarlett-gui</b>  -  Gtk4  GUI  for  the  ALSA controls presented by the Focusrite Scarlett/Clarett
       kernel driver

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>alsa-scarlett-gui</b> [<u>FILE</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
            <b>alsa-scarlett-gui</b> is a Gtk4 GUI for the ALSA  controls  presented  by  the  Linux  kernel  Focusrite
       Scarlett Gen 2/3/Clarett USB/Clarett+ Mixer Driver.

            The  Focusrite  USB  audio interfaces are class compliant meaning that they work "out of the box" on
       Linux as audio and MIDI interfaces (although on Gen 3 you  need  to  disable  MSD  mode  first  for  full
       functionality).  However,  except  for  some  of  the  smallest  models, they have a bunch of proprietary
       functionality that required a kernel driver to be written specifically for those devices.

            Linux kernel  support  ("ALSA  Focusrite  Scarlett  Gen  2/3  Mixer  Driver")  for  the  proprietary
       functionality was first added in:

       •      Scarlett Gen 2: Linux 5.4 (bugs fixed in Linux 5.14)

       •      Scarlett Gen 3: Linux 5.14

       •      Clarett+ 8Pre: Linux 6.1

       •      Clarett 2Pre/4Pre/8Pre USB, Clarett+ 2Pre/4Pre: coming soon

              For full documentation, see: https://github.com/geoffreybennett/alsa-scarlett-gui.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
            <u>FILE</u>           Load the specified .state file on start

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       •      The  linear-dB  scale  of  the volume controls doesn't work well. Lower volumes (e.g. below -30dB)
              don't need as much fine control as higher volumes.

       •      Can’t select (focus) the gain/volume controls or use a keyboard to adjust them.

       •      Level (monitoring) doesn't work yet and is disabled (needs kernel driver update).

       •      Load/Save uses alsactl which will be confused if the ALSA interface name (e.g. USB) changes.

       •      Load/Save is not implemented for simulated interfaces.

       •      Lots of "couldn't find weak ref" warnings are emitted when loading a state file for simulation.

       •      The read-only status of controls in interface simulation mode  does  not  change  when  the  HW/SW
              button is clicked.

       •      When there's more than one main window open, closing one of them doesn't free and close everything
              related to that card.

       •      There  is  no  facility  to  group  channels  into stereo pairs (needs kernel support to save this
              information in the interface).

       •      There is no facility to give channels custom names (needs kernel support to save this  information
              in the interface).

       •      No keyboard accelerators (e.g. Ctrl-Q to quit) have been implemented.
