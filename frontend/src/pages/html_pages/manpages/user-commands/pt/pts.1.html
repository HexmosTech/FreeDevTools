       pts - Introduction to the pts command suite

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The commands in the <b>pts</b> command suite are the administrative interface to the Protection Server, which
       runs on each database server machine in a cell and maintains the Protection Database. The database stores
       the information that AFS uses to augment and refine the standard UNIX scheme for controlling access to
       files and directories.

       Instead of relying only on the mode bits that define access rights for individual files, AFS associates
       an access control list (ACL) with each directory. The ACL lists users and groups and specifies which of
       seven possible access permissions they have for the directory and the files it contains. (It is still
       possible to set a directory or file's mode bits, but AFS interprets them in its own way; see the chapter
       on protection in the <u>OpenAFS</u> <u>Administration</u> <u>Guide</u> for details.)

       AFS enables users to define groups in the Protection Database and place them on ACLs to extend a set of
       rights to multiple users simultaneously.  Groups simplify administration by making it possible to add
       someone to many ACLs by adding them to a group that already exists on those ACLs. Machines can also be
       members of a group, so that users logged into the machine automatically inherit the permissions granted
       to the group.

       There are several categories of commands in the pts command suite:

       •   Commands  to  create and remove Protection Database entries: <b>pts</b> <b>creategroup</b>, <b>pts</b> <b>createuser</b>, and <b>pts</b>
           <b>delete</b>.

       •   Commands to administer and display group membership: <b>pts</b> <b>adduser</b>, <b>pts</b> <b>listowned</b>, <b>pts</b> <b>membership</b>,  and
           <b>pts</b> <b>removeuser</b>.

       •   Commands  to  administer  and display properties of user and group entries other than membership: <b>pts</b>
           <b>chown</b>, <b>pts</b> <b>examine</b>, <b>pts</b> <b>listentries</b>, <b>pts</b> <b>rename</b>, and <b>pts</b> <b>setfields</b>.

       •   Commands to set and examine the counters used when assigning IDs to users and groups: <b>pts</b> <b>listmax</b> and
           <b>pts</b> <b>setmax</b>.

       •   Commands to run commands interactively: <b>pts</b> <b>interactive</b>, <b>pts</b> <b>sleep</b>, and <b>pts</b> <b>quit</b>.

       •   A command to run commands from a file: <b>pts</b> <b>source</b>.

       •   Commands to obtain help: <b>pts</b> <b>apropos</b> and <b>pts</b> <b>help</b>.

       •   A command to display the OpenAFS command suite version: <b>pts</b> <b>version</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following arguments and flags are available on many commands in the <b>pts</b> suite. The reference page for
       each command also lists them, but they are described here in greater detail.

       <b>-cell</b> &lt;<u>cell</u> <u>name</u>&gt;
           Names the cell in which to run the command. It is acceptable to  abbreviate  the  cell  name  to  the
           shortest form that distinguishes it from the other entries in the <u>/etc/openafs/CellServDB</u> file on the
           local  machine.  If the <b>-cell</b> argument is omitted, the command interpreter determines the name of the
           local cell by reading the following in order:

           •   The value of the AFSCELL environment variable.

           •   The local <u>/etc/openafs/ThisCell</u> file.

           •   The local <u>/etc/openafs/server/ThisCell</u> file.

           Do not combine the <b>-cell</b> and <b>-localauth</b> options. A command on which the <b>-localauth</b> flag  is  included
           always  runs in the local cell (as defined in the server machine's local <u>/etc/openafs/server/ThisCell</u>
           file), whereas a command on which the <b>-cell</b> argument is included runs in the specified foreign cell.

       <b>-config</b> &lt;<u>config</u> <u>directory</u>&gt;
           The location of the directory to use to obtain configuration information, including  the  CellServDB.
           This  is  primarily  provided  for  testing  purposes.   If  the <b>-config</b> and <b>-localauth</b> arguments are
           omitted, the command interpreter searches for the configuration information in the following order:

           •   The <u>/etc/openafs</u> directory.

           •   The <u>/etc/openafs/server</u> directory.

       <b>-force</b>
           Enables the command to continue executing as far as possible when errors  or  other  problems  occur,
           rather  than halting execution immediately.  Without it, the command halts as soon as the first error
           is encountered. In either case, the <b>pts</b> command interpreter reports errors at the command shell. This
           flag is especially useful if the issuer provides many values for a command line argument; if  one  of
           them is invalid, the command interpreter continues on to process the remaining arguments.

       <b>-help</b>
           Prints  a  command's online help message on the standard output stream. Do not combine this flag with
           any of the command's other options; when it is provided, the command interpreter  ignores  all  other
           options, and only prints the help message.

       <b>-noauth</b>
           Establishes  an  unauthenticated  connection to the Protection Server, in which the server treats the
           issuer as the unprivileged user "anonymous".  It  is  useful  only  when  authorization  checking  is
           disabled  on  the  server  machine  (during the installation of a file server machine or when the <b>bos</b>
           <b>setauth</b> command has been used during other  unusual  circumstances).  In  normal  circumstances,  the
           Protection Server allows only privileged users to issue commands that change the Protection Database,
           and refuses to perform such an action even if the <b>-noauth</b> flag is provided.

       <b>-encrypt</b>
           Establishes an authenticated, encrypted connection to the Protection Server.  It is useful when it is
           desired to obscure network traffic related to the transactions being done.

       <b>-localauth</b>
           Constructs a server ticket using the server encryption key with the highest key version number in the
           local  <u>/etc/openafs/server/KeyFile</u> file. The <b>pts</b> command interpreter presents the ticket, which never
           expires, to the BOS Server during mutual authentication.

           Use this flag only when issuing a command on a server machine; client machines do not usually have  a
           <u>/etc/openafs/server/KeyFile</u>  file.  The issuer of a command that includes this flag must be logged on
           to the server machine as the local superuser "root". The flag is useful for commands  invoked  by  an
           unattended  application  program,  such  as a process controlled by the UNIX <b>cron</b> utility. It is also
           useful if an administrator is unable to authenticate to AFS but is logged in as the  local  superuser
           "root".

           Do  not  combine the <b>-cell</b> and <b>-localauth</b> options. A command on which the <b>-localauth</b> flag is included
           always runs in the local cell (as defined in the server machine's local  <u>/etc/openafs/server/ThisCell</u>
           file),  whereas a command on which the <b>-cell</b> argument is included runs in the specified foreign cell.
           Also, do not combine the <b>-localauth</b> and <b>-noauth</b> flags.

       <b>-auth</b>
           Use the calling user's tokens from the kernel to communicate with the ptserver  (that  is,  the  same
           tokens displayed by <b><a href="../man1/tokens.1.html">tokens</a></b>(1). This is the default if neither <b>-localauth</b> nor <b>-noauth</b> is given.

           Since  this  option  is  the  default,  it  is  usually  not  useful  for running single command line
           operations. However, it can be useful when running commands via <b><a href="../man1/pts_interactive.1.html">pts_interactive</a></b>(1),  since  otherwise
           it  would be impossible to switch from, for example, <b>-localauth</b> back to using regular tokens during a
           bulk operation. See <b><a href="../man1/pts_interactive.1.html">pts_interactive</a></b>(1) for more details.

</pre><h4><b>PRIVILEGE</b> <b>REQUIRED</b></h4><pre>
       Members of the system:administrators group can issue all <b>pts</b> commands on  any  entry  in  the  Protection
       Database.

       Users who do not belong to the system:administrators group can list information about their own entry and
       any  group  entries  they  own.  The  privacy  flags set with the <b>pts</b> <b>setfields</b> command control access to
       entries owned by other users.
