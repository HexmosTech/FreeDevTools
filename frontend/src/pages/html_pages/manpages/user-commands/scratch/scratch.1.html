</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Scratch - An easy to use interactive programming environment for ages 8 and up.

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       Scratch  is  an  easy,  interactive,  collaborative  programming  environment  designed  for  creation of
       interactive stories, animations, games, music, and art -- and  sharing  these  on  the  web.  Scratch  is
       designed  to  help  young  people  (ages  8  and up) develop 21st century learning skills. As they create
       Scratch projects, young people learn important mathematical and computational ideas, while also gaining a
       deeper understanding of the process of design.  This man page contains basic information  about  Scratch.
