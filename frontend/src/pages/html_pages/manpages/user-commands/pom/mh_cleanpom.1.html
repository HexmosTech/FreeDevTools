</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Maven - Cleans a POM file.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mh_cleanpom</b> [<u>option</u>]... [<u>pom</u>] [<u>target</u>] [<u>pom-props</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Cleans the POM and prepare it for inclusion in the Maven repository.  Also extracts some information from
       the POM.

       debian/maven.rules is used to alter the version properties for the library and its dependencies.

       Where

              [pom] is the location of the POM file to clean.

              Default to pom.xml or debian/pom.xml

              [target] is where the cleaned POM is written to.

              Default to debian/.debhelper/.mh/pom.xml

              [pom-props] is where the POM properties file will be written.

              Default to debian/.debhelper/.mh/pom.properties

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>-h</b> <b>--help</b>: show this text

       <b>-V</b> <b>--version</b>: show the version

       <b>-p</b>&lt;package&gt; <b>--package=</b>&lt;package&gt;: name of the Debian package which

              will contain this POM file

       <b>-h</b> <b>--has-package-version</b>: flag that indicates that this POM has the

              same version as the package, this helps packagers of depending packages

       <b>-o</b> <b>--no-parent</b>: don't inherit from a parent POM

       <b>-k</b> <b>--keep-pom-version</b>: keep the original version of the POM but

              convert  all  other  versions  in  dependencies  and plugins.  If there is a parent POM, keeps its
              version except when the parent is already registered in the Maven repository

       <b>-e</b>&lt;version&gt;, <b>--set-version=</b>&lt;version&gt;: set the version for the POM,

              do not use the version declared in the POM file.

       <b>-r</b>&lt;rules&gt; <b>--rules=</b>&lt;rules&gt;: path to the file containing the

              rules to apply when cleaning the POM.  Optional, the default location is debian/maven.rules

       <b>-R</b>&lt;rule&gt;, <b>--extra-rule=</b>&lt;rule&gt;: extra rule to apply when cleaning the POM

              May occur multiple times, instead of or in addition to <b>-r</b>

       <b>-u</b>&lt;rules&gt; <b>--published-rules=</b>&lt;rules&gt;: path to the file containing the

              extra rules to publish in the property  debian.mavenRules  in  the  cleaned  POM.   Optional,  the
              default location is debian/maven.publishedRules

       <b>-U</b>&lt;rule&gt;, <b>--extra-published-rule=</b>&lt;rule&gt;: extra rule to publish

              May occur multiple times, instead of or in addition to <b>-u</b>

       <b>-i</b>&lt;rules&gt; <b>--ignore-rules=</b>&lt;rules&gt;: path to the file containing the

              rules  used  to remove certain dependencies from the cleaned POM Optional, the default location is
              debian/maven.ignoreRules

       <b>-I</b>&lt;rule&gt;, <b>--extra-ignore-rule=</b>&lt;rule&gt;: extra rule used to remove dependencies

              from the transformed POM May occur multiple times, instead of or in addition to <b>-i</b>

              rules use to remove certain dependencies from the cleaned POM, in addition  to  the  ignore  rules
              specified  previously.  This  is useful in situations such as when the Maven clean target requires
              more  dependencies  or  plugins  to  ignore  than  the  build  target.   All  rules   defined   in
              clean-ignore-rules  will  be  added  to the existing rules in ignore-rules.  Optional, the default
              location is debian/maven.cleanIgnoreRules

              do not even convert versions to the default 'debian' version

       <b>--no-publish-used-rule</b>: don't publish the rule used to transform

              a POM's own attributes in debian.mavenRules

       <b>--keep-elements=</b>&lt;elem1,elem2&gt;: keep the elements listed here

              even  if  they   are   normally   removed   by   the   clean   operation.    Such   elements   are

              used  to  force  the  versions of the Maven plugins used in the current POM file with the versions

       <b>-v</b> <b>--verbose</b>: show more information while running

       <b>-n</b> <b>--no-act</b>: don't actually do anything, just print the results

   <b>Description:</b>
              Cleans a Maven POM and prepare it for inclusion in the Debian repository for Maven.

              The POM will be normalised, and its parent tag removed if the option  <b>--no-parent</b>  is  given.  The
              version  will  be  replaced  by  'debian', unless a special rule applies (see below the discussion
              about rules).  Build, profiles and other build time only sections of the POM will be stripped.

              If versions are given for a dependency, this version will be replaced by the 'debian' version,  or
              a rule can be given to use a custom version

              You  can modify those defaults with the help of the rules file. This file should contain the lines
              with the format: &lt;groupId&gt; [artifactId]  [type]  [version]  [classifier]  [scope]  where  groupId,
              artifactId,  type,  version,  classifier  and scope can be the explicit attribute to match, or can
              contain a wildcard (*) for generic matches.

              Each one of those elements can also be a replace rule,  of  the  form  s/&lt;regex&gt;/&lt;replace&gt;/  where
              regex is a regular expression, and replace is the replacement. Substitution groups $1 $2... can be
              used in the replacement if capture groups () have been used in the regex.

              The  first element is mandatory (groupId), but you can ignore the elements on the right hand side.
              If the scope is missing, then any scope is matched and left unchanged.  If the version is missing,
              then any version will be replaced with 'debian'.  If type is missing, then any type is matched and
              left unchanged.  If artifactId is missing, then any artifactId is matched and left unchanged.

              You can also have comments in this file, it should be a line starting with #

       Example of a rules file:

              s/commons-(.*)/org.apache.commons.commons$1/ org.itext * * s/1\..*/1.x/ org.itext * * s/2\..*/2.x/
              # use the alpha version of plexus-container-default  org.codehaus.plexus  plexus-container-default
              jar s/1\.0-alpha.*/1.0-alpha/

              This  rules  file  does  the  following:  -  all  groupIds  starting  with  commons-  will  have -
              org.apache.commons. prefixed to them - any artifact in the org.itext group with a  version  number
              starting

              with 1. will use the 1.x version

              - any artifact in the org.itext group with a version number starting

              with 2. will use the 2.x version

              - the jar with groupId=org.codehaus.plexus and

              artifactId=plexus-container-default  and a version starting with 1.0-alpha- will use the 1.0-alpha
              version

              The default rule (* * * s/.*/debian/ *) replaces any version number with the 'debian' version  and
              always  applies  last  if there was no other matches.  Another default rule (* * maven-plugin * *)
              keep the version for all plugins as the plugin mechanism requires a version in Maven.

              Any  rules  given  on  the  command  line  (using  <b>-R</b>/--extra-rule,  <b>-U</b>/--extra-published-rule  or
              <b>-I</b>/--extra-ignore-rule)  are  applied  in the order given, in between the rules given in the rules
              file (if any) and the default rules.
