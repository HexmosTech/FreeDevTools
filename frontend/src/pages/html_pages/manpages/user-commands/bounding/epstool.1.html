</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       epstool - Edit preview images and fix bounding boxes in EPS files.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>epstool</b> <u>command</u> [ <u>options</u> ] <u>inputfile</u> <u>outputfile</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>epstool</b>  is  a  utility  to  create or extract preview images in EPS files. It can also calculate optimal
       bounding boxes.

   <b>EPS</b> <b>(Encapsulated</b> <b>PostScript</b> <b>Format)</b>
       EPS is a specialised form of a PostScript file that complies with the  Document  Structuring  Conventions
       (DSC)  and is intended to be embedded inside another PostScript file.  An EPS file must contain a special
       first line that identifies it as an EPS file  (e.g.  <b>%!PS-Adobe-3.0</b>  <b>EPSF-3.0</b>)  and  it  must  contain  a
       <b>%%BoundingBox:</b>  line.   The  EPS  file  only draws within the rectangle defined by the bounding box.  The
       PostScript code must avoid using PostScript operators that would interfere  with  the  embedding.   These
       include operators with global effects such as changing the page size and changing the half tone screen.

   <b>PREVIEWS</b>
       EPS  files  may  contain a preview to be used by programs that can't interpret the PostScript code. There
       are three ways to add a preview to an EPS file.

       Interchange
              This preview is included  within  PostScript  comments  in  a  section  marked  %%BeginPreview:  /
              %%EndPreview.  The actual image data is stored in hexadecimal format. This format is most commonly
              used on Unix.

       DOS EPS
              The preview is a TIFF or Windows Metafile. A DOS EPS file has a 30 byte binary header which  gives
              offsets  and  lengths for the PostScript, TIFF and Windows Metafile sections. You can't send a DOS
              EPS file directly to a printer - you have to remove the binary  header  and  preview  first.  This
              format is most commonly used on MS-Windows.

       PICT   The  preview  is  in  PICT  format  stored  in the resource fork of the file.  This format is most
              commonly used on the Macinstosh.  Epstool provides limited support for this format.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b> <b>(one</b> <b>only):</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-t4,</b> <b>--add-tiff4-preview</b>
              Add a TIFF 4 preview. The preview is monochrome and is intended for use  with  old  programs  that
              won't read TIFF6, such as Word Perfect 5.1 for DOS.

       <b>-t6u,</b> <b>--add-tiff6u-preview</b>
              Add  a  TIFF  6  uncompressed  preview.  See  <b>--add-tiff6p-preview</b>  for  how to add a greyscale or
              monochrome preview.

       <b>-t6p,</b> <b>--add-tiff6p-preview</b>
              Add a TIFF 6 preview compressed with packbits (simple  run  length  encoding).  The  preview  will
              normally  be  full  colour, but you can make it greyscale by adding the option <b>--device</b> <b>bmpgray</b> or
              <b>--device</b> <b>pgmraw,</b> or monochrome using <b>--device</b> <b>bmpmono</b> or <b>--device</b> <b>pbmraw</b>.

       <b>-tg,</b> <b>--add-tiff-preview</b>
              Add a TIFF preview using ghostscript to generate the TIFF file. You must specify a  suitable  TIFF
              device using <b>--device</b>. If you want a compressed monochrome image, you might use <b>--device</b> <b>tiffg3</b>.

       <b>-i,</b> <b>--add-interchange-preview</b>
              Add a monochrome interchange preview.

       <b>-w,</b> <b>--add-metafile-preview</b>
              Add  a Windows Metafile (WMF) preview. The metafile will contain a bitmap, not vector information.
              The preview will normally be full colour. See <b>--add-tiff6p-preview</b> for how to add a  greyscale  or
              monochrome preview.

       <b>--add-pict-preview</b>
              Add  a  Mac  PICT  preview.   EPSF  files  with  PICT  previews  can generally be used only on Mac
              computers.  The preview will be full colour.  The AppleSingle and MacBinary formats  will  contain
              the  EPSF  and  the preview.  The AppleDouble or Resource format will contain the preview only and
              needs to accompany the  original  EPSF  file.   To  specify  the  file  format  use  <b>--mac-single</b>,
              <b>--mac-double</b>, <b>--mac-binary</b> or <b>--mac-rsrc</b>.

       <b>--add-user-preview</b>  <u>filename</u>
              Add  a user supplied image as a preview. The image can be a Windows bitmap, a PBMPLUS file, a TIFF
              image or a Windows Metafile.  Window  bitmaps  and  PBMPLUS  files  will  be  converted  to  TIFF6
              compressed with packbits. TIFF and Windows Metafile images will be added unchanged.

       <b>--bitmap</b>
              Create  a  bitmap  of the area within the EPS bounding box. The bitmap type must be specified with
              <b>--device</b>.  If processing a DCS 2.0 file, the separation can be specified with <b>--page-number</b>.

       <b>--copy</b> Copy the EPS file. This is generally used with the <b>--bbox</b> option to update the bounding box.

       <b>--dcs2-multi</b>
              Convert DCS 2.0 separations to multiple files. See DCS 2.0. If the output name  is  out.eps,  then
              the separations would be named out.eps.Cyan etc.

       <b>--dcs2-single</b>
              Convert DCS 2.0 separations to a single file. See DCS 2.0.

       <b>--dcs2-report</b>
              Write  the  separation  names,  lengths  and  CMYK  values to standard output. This can be used to
              identify if a DCS 2.0 file is missing the composite page or preview.

       <b>--dump</b> Display some information about the file type and DSC comments.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--extract-postscript</b>
              Extract the PostScript section from a DOS EPS file.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--extract-preview</b>
              Extract the preview section from a DOS EPS file.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Display a summary of the epstool commands and options.

       <b>--test-eps</b>
              Partially test if a file complies with the EPSF specification.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-b,</b> <b>--bbox</b>
              Calculate the bounding box using the ghostscript bbox device and update in the EPS file.

       <b>--combine-separations</b>  <u>filename</u>
              Combine the separations of the input DCS 2.0 file with those of this file.  It is an error if  the
              bounding  boxes  do not match or they contain separations with the same name.  This option must be
              used with <b>--dcs2-multi</b> or <b>--dcs2-single</b>.  The composite page may later need  to  be  updated  with
              <b>--replace-composite</b>.

       <b>--combine-tolerance</b>  <u>pts</u>
              When  using  <b>--combine-separations</b>,  allow  the  bounding  boxes to vary by up to <u>pts</u> points.  The
              default is 0 so the bounding boxes must match exactly.

       <b>--custom-colours</b>  <u>filename</u>
              When using <b>--replace-composite</b> on a DCS 2.0 file, use  the  colours  specified  in  this  file  in
              preference to those specified in the composite page.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--debug</b>
              Be more verbose about progress. Do not remove temporary files.

       <b>--device</b> <u>name</u>
              Specify   a   ghostscript   device   to   be  used  when  creating  the  preview  or  bitmap.  For
              <b>--add-tiff-preview</b> this must be one of the ghostscript tiff devices (e.g. tiffg3, tiff24nc).   For
              any  other  preview,  it  must be one of the bmp or pbmplus devices (e.g. bmpgray, bmp16m, pgmraw,
              ppmraw). For bitmap output (<b>--bitmap</b>) it can be any ghostscript bitmap device.

       <b>--doseps-reverse</b>
              When writing a DOS EPS file (TIFF or WMF preview), the default is to write the  PostScript  before
              the  preview.   Using  <b>--doseps-reverse</b>  puts  the preview before the PostScript section, which is
              required by some buggy programs.  Either order is correct.

       <b>--dpi</b> <u>resolution</u>
              Set the resolution of the preview or bitmap. The default is 72 dpi.

       <b>--dpi-render</b> <u>resolution</u>
              Render at a higher resolution set by <b>--dpi-render</b> , then  downsample  to  the  resolution  set  by
              <b>--dpi</b>.  This  works  when adding a preview image or using <b>--replace-composite</b> , but not when using
              <b>--bitmap.</b>  This improves the preview quality when the original contains a pre-rendered  image  and
              <b>--dpi-render</b> is set to match the original target printer.

       <b>--ignore-information</b>
              Ignore  information  messages  from the DSC parser.  Use at your own risk.  These messages usually
              indicate that something is wrong with an EPS file, but that most EPS handlers probably won't care.
              An example is a line with more than 255 characters.

       <b>--ignore-warnings</b>
              Ignore warnings from the DSC parser.  Use at your own risk.   These  messages  are  usually  about
              faults  in  the  DSC comments that are recoverable by <b>epstool</b>, but may confuse other EPS handlers.
              An example is a bounding box that incorrectly uses floating point numbers instead of integer.

       <b>--ignore-errors</b>
              Ignore warnings from the DSC parser. Use at your own risk. You really  should  fix  the  EPS  file
              first.

       <b>--gs</b> <b>command</b>
              Specify  the  name  the  ghostscript program. On Unix the default is gs.  On Windows, <b>epstool</b> will
              check the registry for installed versions of ghostscript and use the latest, otherwise it will use
              gswin32c.exe.

       <b>--gs-args</b> <u>arguments</u>
              Specify additional Ghostscript  arguments.  This  might  be  used  to  select  anti-aliasing  with
              "-dTextAlphaBits=4 -dGraphicsAlphaBits=4"

       <b>--output</b> <u>filename</u>
              Specify the output file (instead of using the second file parameter).  Using the filename <b>-</b> causes
              epstool to write to standard output, which requires the use of <b>--quiet</b>.

       <b>--mac-binary</b>
              When adding a PICT preview, use the MacBinary I format.  for the Mac

       <b>--mac-double</b>
              When adding a PICT preview, use the AppleDouble format for the Mac.

       <b>--mac-rsrc</b>
              When adding a PICT preview, use the Resource format for the Mac.

       <b>--mac-single</b>
              When adding a PICT preview, use the AppleSingle format for the Mac.

       <b>--missing-separations</b>
              When  writing  a  DCS  2.0 file, epstool will normally fail if a separation is missing.  When this
              option is used, it will remove references to missing separations when writing the file.

       <b>--page-number</b> <u>page</u>
              When creating a bitmap with <b>--device</b> from a DCS 2.0 file, <u>page</u>  specifies  the  separation  to  be
              used.   Page  1 is the composite and page 2 is the first separation.  Use <b>--dcs2-report</b> to get the
              list of separations.

       <b>--quiet</b>
              Try to run without writing to standard output.

       <b>--rename-separation</b> <u>oldname</u> <u>newname</u>
              When copying a DCS 2.0 file with <b>--dcs2-multi</b> or <b>--dcs2-single</b>, rename separation with <u>oldname</u>  to
              <u>newname</u>.   This  option implies <b>--missing-separations</b>.  It is assumed that the new name is just an
              alias for the same colour and that the CMYK or RGB values for  the  separation  are  not  changed.
              This  option  may be used multiple times.  This must be used if the input file incorrectly has two
              separations of the same name.

       <b>--replace-composite</b>
              Some DCS 2.0 files do not have an image in the composite page. This option replaces the  composite
              page with a CMYK image derived from the separations. This option must be used with <b>--dcs2-multi</b> or
              <b>--dcs2-single</b>. See also the options <b>--dpi</b> and <b>--custom-colours</b>.

</pre><h4><b>MACINTOSH</b></h4><pre>
       The Macintosh does not use a flat file system.  Each file can have a data fork and a resource fork.  EPSF
       files  have the PostScript in the data fork, and optionally have a preview in the resource fork as a PICT
       image.  In addition, file type is obtained from the finder info rather than a file extension.  File types
       use a four character code such as "EPSF" or "PICT".  When Macintosh files are copied to  a  foreign  file
       system,  the  resource  fork may be left behind.  Alternatives to retain the resource fork are to package
       the finder data, data fork and resource fork in a single MacBinary or AppleSingle file,  or  to  put  the
       data  fork  in  a  flat  file  and the finder info and resource fork in an AppleDouble file.  The Mac OSX
       finder will handle AppleDouble files automatically when copying files to and from a foreign file  system.
       When copying <u>test.eps</u> to a foreign file system, the data fork would be written as <u>test.eps</u> and the finder
       info and resource fork to the AppleDouble file <u>._test.eps</u> or <u>.AppleDouble/test.eps</u>.

       Epstool  can read MacBinary and AppleSingle files.  It can write MacBinary I, AppleSingle, AppleDouble or
       Resource files.  Files written by epstool will have type <u>EPSF</u> and creator <u>MSWD</u>.  When adding a preview to
       <u>test.eps</u>, it is suggested that you create the MacBinary file <u>test.eps.bin</u>.  On a Macintosh  computer  you
       then  need  to extract it with StuffIt Expander.  Another alternative is to write the AppleDouble file to
       <u>._test.eps</u> then copy <b>both</b> <b>files</b> to a file system accessible to a Mac computer.

       If the output file name starts with <u>.</u> then AppleDouble will be assumed, otherwise if  it  ends  with  <u>.as</u>
       then AppleSingle will be assumed, otherwise if it ends with <u>.rsrc</u> or <u>/rsrc</u> then Resource will be assumed,
       otherwise  MacBinary  will be assumed.  When writing a MacBinary file, it is recommended that you end the
       filename in <u>.bin</u>.  To force the file type, use <b>--mac-single</b>, <b>--mac-double</b>, <b>--mac-binary</b> or <b>--mac-rsrc</b>.

       On Mac OS X you can access a file's resource fork from command line  tools  by  appending  <u>/rsrc</u>  to  the
       original  file name.  The easiest way to add a preview to the file <u>test.eps</u> on Mac OS X is to let epstool
       write in <b>--mac-rsrc</b> format to <u>test.eps/rsrc</u> (see <b>Examples</b>).

</pre><h4><b>DESKTOP</b> <b>COLOR</b> <b>SEPARATIONS</b> <b>(DCS</b> <b>2.0)</b></h4><pre>
       The Desktop Color Separation (DCS) image file format contains a low resolution preview, a main file  with
       the  full  resolution composite image, and colour separations with full resolution separated plates.  The
       separations will typically contain Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black and possibly spot colours.  There are two
       versions of DCS 2.0.

       Multiple File
              The main file contains <u>%%PlateFile:</u> <u>(name)</u> <u>EPS</u> <u>Local</u> <u>filename</u> comments which give the filenames of
              the separation plates.  The main  file  may  contain  a  low  resolution  DOS  EPS  preview.   The
              separation files do not contain previews.

       Single File
              This  is  an  abuse  of  the  EPS  specification.   The single file contains the main file and the
              separations concatenated together,  which  makes  the  DSC  comments  incorrect.   The  main  file
              specifies  the  byte  offsets  to the separations using <u>%%PlateFile:</u> <u>(name)</u> <u>EPS</u> <u>#offset</u> <u>size</u>.  The
              single file may then be placed inside a DOS EPS file with a low resolution preview.   By  default,
              epstool writes single file DCS 2.0.

       Epstool  can  add  previews  to  single and multiple file DCS 2.0.  It can split single file DCS 2.0 into
       multiple files and vice versa.  This allows a single file DCS  2.0  to  be  split,  the  composite  image
       replaced, a new preview created, and then be recombined into a single file.

       Some  DCS  2.0 files do not have an image in the composite page.  To determine if the composite page does
       not contain an image, use <b>--dcs2-report</b> and look to see if the composite section is  very  short.   Using
       <b>--dcs2-single</b>  <b>--replace-composite</b> replaces the composite page with the headers of the original composite
       page and a body containing a CMYK image derived from the separations.  Set the  resolution  of  the  CMYK
       image using <b>--dpi</b>.

       When  replacing  the  composite  page  with  a CMYK image using <b>--replace-composite</b>, the <b>--custom-colours</b>
       option is useful for dealing with DCS 2.0 files that have incorrect CMYK colours, for example  specifying
       that  the  varnish  layer  is  grey.   Each  line  of  the  CMYK  colours  file  is  formatted like a DSC
       <u>%%CMYKCustomColor:</u> or <u>%%RGBCustomColor:</u> line, as shown in the example below.

       %%CMYKCustomColor: 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 Varnish

       %%CMYKCustomColor: 1.00 0.68 0.00 0.12 (Dark Blue)

       %%RGBCustomColor: 0.5 0.0 0.0 (Dark Red)

       DCS2 files should not have two separations with the same name.  Epstool will not allow a DCS2 output file
       to have duplicate separation names.  Use <b>--rename-separation</b> to resolve this.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Add colour preview (24bit/pixel) to EPS file
                epstool -t6p tiger.eps output.eps

       Add TIFF (G3 Fax) preview to tiger.eps.
                epstool --add-tiff-preview --device tiffg3 tiger.eps output.eps

       Any GS TIFF device can be used, e.g. tiffg4, tiffpack

       Extract TIFF preview from tiger.eps
                epstool -v tiger.eps tiger.tif

       Fix incorrect %%BoundingBox then add TIFF4 preview.
                epstool --bbox -t4 golfer.eps output.eps

       Adjust the BoundingBox of an existing EPS file, but don't add a preview:
                epstool --copy --bbox input.eps output.eps

       Add user supplied Windows Metafile to EPS file.
                epstool --add-user-preview logo.wmf logo.eps output.eps

       Typically used when an application can export EPS and WMF  separately  but  can't  export  EPS  with  WMF
       preview.

       Add a PICT preview and write an AppleDouble file.
                epstool --add-pict-preview --mac-double tiger.eps ._tiger.eps

       To be used by a Mac, both <u>tiger.eps</u> and <u>._tiger.eps</u> need to be on a foreign file system accessible to the
       Mac.

       Add a PICT preview, overwriting the existing resources.
               epstool --add-pict-preview --mac-rsrc tiger.eps tiger.eps/rsrc

       On  Mac  OS  X  you can access a file's resource fork from command line tools by appending "/rsrc" to the
       file's original name.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       When adding a WMF preview to an EPS file using <b>-add-user-preview</b> <b>filename</b>, the placeable metafile  header
       is  removed  from the metafile as it is put into the EPS file.  When extracting a WMF preview from an EPS
       file, a placeable metafile header is created  from  the  EPS  BoundingBox  information.   This  placeable
       metafile header assumes that the WMF has its origin at (0,0), which might not be correct.

       When epstool is creating a TIFF or WMF preview, it will convert palette colour images into 24-bit/pixel.

       The environment variable TEMP should point to a writeable directory for temporary files.  If not defined,
       <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> will be used for Unix and the current directory will be used for other platforms.
