       ykushcmd - control application for Yepkit YKUSH Switchable USB Hub board

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ykushcmd</b> [board_name] [<b>-s</b> <u>serial_number</u>] [OPTIONS] ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ykushcmd</b> allows you to control the ports of a Yepkit YKUSH Switchable USB Hub board.

   <b>Board</b> <b>names</b>
           ykush          YKUSH board
           ykush3         YKUSH3 board
           ykushxs        YKUSHXS board

       The [board_name] must be provided for commands addressed for a specific board.

       For general or common commands, applicable to all board models, the [board_name] has to be omited from
       the command.

   <b>YKUSH</b> <b>board</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-d</b> 1|2|3|a

           Power Down/Off downstream port with the number privided.

           If [a] is provided as the port number then all ports will be switched.

       <b>-u</b> 1|2|3|a

           Power Up/On downstream port number downstream_number

       <b>-s</b> serial_number

           Board serial number to which the command is addressed.

           When multiple YKUSH boards are connected to a host, this option
           should be used to specify the board. If more than one board is
           connected and this option is not provided the command will be sent to
           the first board in the USB enumeration list.

       <b>-l</b>

           Lists the serial numbers of the YKUSH boards attached to the host.

       <b>-g</b> 1|2|3

           Show state of a downstream port.

       <b>-h</b>

           Display help for YKUSH board specific commands.

   <b>YKUSH3</b> <b>board</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-d</b> 1|2|3|a

           Power Down/Off downstream port with the number privided.

           If [a] is provided as the port number then all ports will be
           switched.

       <b>-u</b> 1|2|3|a

           Power Up/On downstream port number downstream_number

       <b>-s</b> serial_number

       Board serial number to which the command is addressed.

           When multiple YKUSH boards are connected to a host, this option
           should be used to specify the board. If more than one board is
           connected and this option is not provided the command will be sent to
           the first board in the USB enumeration list.

       <b>-l</b>

           Lists the serial numbers of the YKUSH boards attached to the host.

       <b>-g</b> 1|2|3

           Show state of a downstream port.

       <b>-c</b> &lt;port-number&gt; &lt;config-value&gt;

           Configure the default state of a downstream port
           (port-number=1|2|3|e) at power-on. The port number &lt;e&gt; refers to
           exteranl 5V port.

           The default states are off (config-value=0), on (config-value=1) and
           persistent (config-value=2).

       <b>-on</b>

           Switch On the 5V output power port.

       <b>-off</b>

           Switch Off the 5V output power port.

       <b>-r</b> 1|2|3

           Read GPIO with the number provided (1, 2 or 3).

       <b>-w</b> 1|2|3 0|1

           Write to the GPIO with the number provided (1, 2 or 3).

           Writing a value of 1 or 0 will drive the GPIO to logical high or low,
           respectively.

       <b>--gpio</b> enable|disable

           Enable / Disable GPIO control interface. Will become active on next
           reset/power-on.

       <b>--reset</b>

           Resets (reboot) the YKUSH3 board.

       <b>-h</b>

           Display help for YKUSH board specific commands.

       <b>--bootloader-version</b>

           Board bootloader version.

       <b>--firmware-version</b>

           Board firmware version.

       <b>--boot</b>

           Enter bootloader mode for firmware update.

   <b>YKUSHXS</b> <b>board</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-d</b>

           Power Down/Off the downstream port.

       <b>-u</b>

           Power Up/On the downstream port

       <b>-s</b> serial_number

           Board serial number to which the command is addressed.

           When multiple YKUSHXS boards are connected to a host, this option
           should be used to specify the board. If more than one board is
           connected and this option is not provided the command will be sent to
           the first board in the USB enumeration list.

       <b>-l</b>

           Lists the serial numbers of the YKUSHXS boards attached to the host.

       <b>-g</b>

           Show state of the downstream port.

       <b>-h</b>

           Display help for YKUSHXS board specific commands.
