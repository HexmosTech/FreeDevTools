</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       bbmap.sh - Fast and accurate splice-aware read aligner.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       To index:

              <b>bbmap.sh</b> ref=&lt;reference fasta&gt;

       To map:

              <b>bbmap.sh</b> in=&lt;reads&gt; out=&lt;output sam&gt;

       To map without writing an index:

              <b>bbmap.sh</b> ref=&lt;reference fasta&gt; in=&lt;reads&gt; out=&lt;output sam&gt; nodisk

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       in=stdin  will  accept  reads  from  standard  in,  and  out=stdout  will write to standard out, but file
       extensions are still needed to specify the format of the input and output files e.g. in=stdin.fa.gz  will
       read gzipped fasta from standard in; out=stdout.sam.gz will write gzipped sam.

   <b>Indexing</b> <b>Parameters</b> <b>(required</b> <b>when</b> <b>building</b> <b>the</b> <b>index):</b>
       nodisk=f
              Set to true to build index in memory and write nothing to disk except output.

       ref=&lt;file&gt;
              Specify  the  reference  sequence.   Only  do  this  ONCE,  when  building the index (unless using
              'nodisk').

       build=1
              If multiple references are indexed in the same directory, each needs a unique numeric  ID  (unless
              using 'nodisk').

       k=13   Kmer length, range 8-15.  Longer is faster but uses more memory.  Shorter is more sensitive.

              If indexing and mapping are done in two steps, K should be specified each time.

       path=&lt;.&gt;
              Specify the location to write the index, if you don't want it in the current working directory.

       usemodulo=f
              Throw  away  ~80%  of kmers based on remainder modulo a number (reduces RAM by 50% and sensitivity
              slightly).  Should be enabled both when building the index AND when mapping.

       rebuild=f
              Force a rebuild of the index (ref= should be set).

   <b>Input</b> <b>Parameters:</b>
       build=1
              Designate index to use.  Corresponds to the number specified when building the index.

       in=&lt;file&gt;
              Primary reads input; required parameter.

       in2=&lt;file&gt;
              For paired reads in two files.

       interleaved=auto
              True forces paired/interleaved  input;  false  forces  single-ended  mapping.  If  not  specified,
              interleaved status will be autodetected from read names.

       fastareadlen=500
              Break up FASTA reads longer than this.  Max is 500 for BBMap and 6000 for BBMapPacBio.  Only works
              for  FASTA  input  (use  'maxlen'  for  FASTQ  input).   The  default for <b>bbmap.sh</b> is 500, and for
              <b>mapPacBio.sh</b> is 6000.

       unpigz=f
              Spawn a pigz (parallel gzip) process for faster decompression than using Java.  Requires  pigz  to
              be installed.

       touppercase=t
              (tuc)  Convert  lowercase  letters  in  reads  to  upper  case  (otherwise they will not match the
              reference).

   <b>Sampling</b> <b>Parameters:</b>
       reads=-1
              Set to a positive number N to only process the first N reads (or pairs), then quit.  <b>-1</b> means  use
              all reads.

       samplerate=1
              Set  to  a  number  from  0 to 1 to randomly select that fraction of reads for mapping. 1 uses all
              reads.

       skipreads=0
              Set to a number N to skip the first N reads (or pairs), then map the rest.

   <b>Mapping</b> <b>Parameters:</b>
       fast=f This flag is a macro which sets other parameters to run faster, at reduced sensitivity.   Bad  for
              RNA-seq.

       slow=f This  flag  is a macro which sets other parameters to run slower, at greater sensitivity.  'vslow'
              is even slower.

       maxindel=16000
              Don't look for indels longer than this. Lower is faster.

              Set to &gt;=100k for RNAseq with long introns like mammals.

       strictmaxindel=f
              When enabled, do not allow indels longer than 'maxindel'.

              By default these are not sought, but may be found anyway.

       tipsearch=100
              Look this far for read-end deletions with anchors shorter than K, using brute force.

       minid=0.76
              Approximate minimum alignment identity to look for.

              Higher is faster and less sensitive.

       minhits=1
              Minimum number of seed hits required for candidate sites.

              Higher is faster.

       local=f
              Set to true to use local, rather than global, alignments.

              This will soft-clip ugly ends of poor alignments.

       perfectmode=f
              Allow only perfect mappings when set to true (very fast).

       semiperfectmode=f
              Allow only perfect and semiperfect (perfect except for N's in the reference) mappings.

       threads=auto
              (t) Set to number of threads desired.  By default, uses all cores available.

       ambiguous=best
              (ambig) Set behavior on ambiguously-mapped reads (with

              multiple top-scoring mapping locations).

              best    (use the first best site)

              toss    (consider unmapped)

              random  (select one top-scoring site randomly)

              all     (retain all top-scoring sites)

       samestrandpairs=f
              (ssp) Specify whether paired reads should map to the same strand or opposite strands.

       requirecorrectstrand=t
              (rcs) Forbid pairing of reads without correct strand orientation.

              Set to false for long-mate-pair libraries.

       killbadpairs=f
              (kbp) If a read pair is mapped with an inappropriate insert size or orientation, the read with the
              lower mapping quality is marked unmapped.

       pairedonly=f
              (po) Treat unpaired reads as unmapped.  Thus they will be sent to 'outu' but not 'outm'.

       rcomp=f
              Reverse complement both reads prior to mapping (for LMP outward-facing libraries).

       rcompmate=f
              Reverse complement read2 prior to mapping.

       pairlen=32000
              Set max allowed distance between paired reads.

              (insert size)=(pairlen)+(read1 length)+(read2 length)

       rescuedist=1200
              Don't try to rescue paired reads if avg. insert size greater than this.  Lower is faster.

       rescuemismatches=32
              Maximum mismatches allowed in a rescued read.  Lower is faster.

       averagepairdist=100
              (apd) Initial average distance between paired reads.

              Varies dynamically; does not need to be specified.

       deterministic=f
              Run in  deterministic  mode.   In  this  case  it  is  good  to  set  averagepairdist.   BBMap  is
              deterministic without this flag if using single-ended reads, or run singlethreaded.

       bandwidthratio=0
              (bwr)  If  above  zero,  restrict alignment band to this fraction of read length.  Faster but less
              accurate.

       bandwidth=0
              (bw) Set the bandwidth directly.  fraction of read length.  Faster but less accurate.

       usejni=f
              (jni) Do  alignments  faster,  in  C  code.   Requires  compiling  the  C  code;  details  are  in
              <u>/jni/README.txt</u>.

       maxsites2=800
              Don't analyze (or print) more than this many alignments per read.

       ignorefrequentkmers=t
              (ifk) Discard low-information kmers that occur often.

       excludefraction=0.03
              (ef) Fraction of kmers to ignore.  For example, 0.03 will ignore the most common 3% of kmers.

       greedy=t
              Use a greedy algorithm to discard the least-useful kmers on a per-read basis.

       kfilter=0
              If positive, potential mapping sites must have at least this many consecutive exact matches.

   <b>Quality</b> <b>and</b> <b>Trimming</b> <b>Parameters:</b>

       renamebyinsert=f
              Renames reads based on their mapped insert size.

       secondarycov=t
              Include coverage of secondary alignments.

       physcov=f
              Calculate physical coverage for paired reads.  This includes the unsequenced bases.

       delcoverage=t
              (delcov) Count bases covered by deletions as covered.  True is faster than false.

       covk=0 If positive, calculate kmer coverage statistics.

   <b>Java</b> <b>Parameters:</b>
       <b>-Xmx</b>   This will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.  <b>-Xmx20g</b> will specify 20 gigs of RAM,
              and <b>-Xmx800m</b> will specify 800 megs.  The max is typically  85%  of  physical  memory.   The  human
              genome  requires around 24g, or 12g with the 'usemodulo' flag.  The index uses roughly 6 bytes per
              reference base.

       <b>-eoom</b>  This flag will cause the process to exit if an  out-of-memory  exception  occurs.   Requires  Java
              8u92+.

       <b>-da</b>    Disable assertions.
