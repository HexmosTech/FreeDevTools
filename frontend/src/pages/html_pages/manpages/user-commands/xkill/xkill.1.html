</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xkill - kill a client by its X resource

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xkill</b> [-display <u>displayname</u>] [-id <u>resource</u>] [-button number] [-frame] [-all] [-version]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Xkill</u>  is  a  utility  for  forcing  the  X server to close connections to clients.  This program is very
       dangerous, but is useful for aborting programs that have displayed undesired windows on a user's  screen.
       If no resource identifier is given with <u>-id</u>, <u>xkill</u> will display a special cursor as a prompt for the user
       to  select a window to be killed.  If a pointer button is pressed over a non-root window, the server will
       close its connection to the client that created the window.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-display</b> <u>displayname</u>
               This option specifies the name of the X server to contact.

       <b>-id</b> <u>resource</u>
               This option specifies the X identifier for the resource whose creator is to be  aborted.   If  no
               resource  is specified, <u>xkill</u> will display a special cursor with which you should select a window
               to be kill.

       <b>-button</b> <u>number</u>
               This option specifies the number of pointer button that should be used in selecting a  window  to
               kill.   If  the  word "any" is specified, any button on the pointer may be used.  By default, the
               first button in the pointer map (which is usually the leftmost button) is used.

       <b>-all</b>    This option indicates that all clients with top-level windows on the  screen  should  be  killed.
               <u>Xkill</u>  will  ask you to select the root window with each of the currently defined buttons to give
               you several chances to abort.  Use of this option is highly discouraged.

       <b>-frame</b>  This option indicates that xkill should ignore the standard  conventions  for  finding  top-level
               client  windows  (which  are typically nested inside a window manager window), and simply believe
               that you want to kill direct children of the root.

       <b>-version</b>
               This option makes xkill print its version and exit without killing anything.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       This command does not provide any warranty that the application whose  connection  to  the  X  server  is
       closed will abort nicely, or even abort at all. All this command does is to close the connection to the X
       server.  Many  existing applications do indeed abort when their connection to the X server is closed, but
       some can choose to continue.

</pre><h4><b>XDEFAULTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Button</b>  Specifies a specific pointer button number or the word "any" to use when selecting windows.
