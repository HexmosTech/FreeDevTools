       arp-fingerprint - Fingerprint a system using ARP

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>arp-fingerprint</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>target</u>

       The  target should be specified as a single IP address or hostname.  You cannot specify multiple targets,
       IP networks or ranges.

       If you use an IP address for the target, you can use the <b>-o</b> option to pass the <b>--numeric</b> option  to  <b>arp-</b>
       <b>scan</b>,  which  will prevent it from attempting DNS lookups.  This can speed up the fingerprinting process,
       especially on systems with a slow or faulty DNS configuration.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>arp-fingerprint</b> fingerprints the specified target host using the ARP protocol.

       It sends various different types of ARP request to the target, and records which types  it  responds  to.
       From  this, it constructs a fingerprint string consisting of "1" where the target responded and "0" where
       it did not.  An example of a fingerprint string is <u>01000100000</u>.  This fingerprint string is then used  to
       lookup the likely target operating system.

       Many of the fingerprint strings are shared by several operating systems, so there is not always a one-to-
       one  mapping between fingerprint strings and operating systems. Also the fact that a system's fingerprint
       matches a certain operating system (or list of operating systems) does  not  necessarily  mean  that  the
       system  being  fingerprinted  is  that operating system, although it is quite likely. This is because the
       list of operating systems is not exhaustive; it is just what I have discovered to  date,  and  there  are
       bound to be operating systems that are not listed.

       The  ARP fingerprint of a system is generally a function of that system's kernel (although it is possible
       for the ARP function to be implemented in user space, it almost never is).

       Sometimes, an operating system can give  different  fingerprints  depending  on  the  configuration.   An
       example  is  Linux,  which will respond to a non-local source IP address if that IP is routed through the
       interface being tested.  This is both good and bad: on one hand it makes  the  fingerprinting  task  more
       complex; but on the other, it can allow some aspects of the system configuration to be determined.

       Sometimes the fact that two different operating systems share a common ARP fingerprint string points to a
       re-use of networking code. One example of this is Windows NT and FreeBSD.

       <b>arp-fingerprint</b> uses <b>arp-scan</b> to send the ARP requests and receive the replies.

       There  are  other  methods  that  can be used to fingerprint a system using <b>arp-scan</b> which can be used in
       addition to <b>arp-fingerprint</b>.  These additional methods are not included in <b>arp-fingerprint</b> either because
       they are likely to cause disruption to the target system,  or  because  they  require  knowledge  of  the
       target's configuration that may not always be available.

       Most  of  the  ARP requests that <b>arp-fingerprint</b> sends are non-standard, so it could disrupt systems that
       don't have a robust TCP/IP stack.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>     Display a brief usage message and exit.

       <b>-v</b>     Display verbose progress messages.

       <b>-o</b> <b>&lt;option-string&gt;</b>
              Pass specified options to arp-scan. You need to  enclose  the  options  string  in  quotes  if  it
              contains spaces. e.g.  -o "-I eth1".  The commonly used options are --interface (-I) and --numeric
              (-N).

       <b>-l</b>     Fingerprint  all  hosts  on the local network. You do not need to specify any target hosts if this
              option is given.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       $ arp-fingerprint 192.168.0.1
       192.168.0.1   01000100000     Linux 2.2, 2.4, 2.6

       $ arp-fingerprint -o "-N -I eth1" 192.168.0.202
       192.168.0.202 11110100000     FreeBSD 5.3, Win98, WinME, NT4, 2000, XP, 2003

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>arp-fingerprint</b> is implemented in Perl, so you need to have the Perl interpreter installed on your system
       to use it.
