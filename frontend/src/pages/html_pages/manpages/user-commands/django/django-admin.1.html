</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       django-admin - Utility script for the Django web framework

       <b>django-admin</b>  is  Django's  command-line utility for administrative tasks.  This document outlines all it
       can do.

       In addition, <b>manage.py</b> is automatically created in each  Django  project.  It  does  the  same  thing  as
       <b>django-admin</b>  but  also  sets  the  <u>DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE</u> environment variable so that it points to your
       project's <b>settings.py</b> file.

       The <b>django-admin</b> script should be on your system path if you installed Django via <b>pip</b>.  If  it's  not  in
       your path, ensure you have your virtual environment activated.

       Generally,  when  working  on a single Django project, it's easier to use <b>manage.py</b> than <b>django-admin</b>. If
       you need to switch between multiple Django settings files, use <b>django-admin</b>  with  <u>DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE</u>
       or the <u>--settings</u> command line option.

       The command-line examples throughout this document use <b>django-admin</b> to be consistent, but any example can
       use <b>manage.py</b> or <b>python</b> <b>-m</b> <b>django</b> just as well.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
          $ django-admin &lt;command&gt; [options]
          $ manage.py &lt;command&gt; [options]
          $ python -m django &lt;command&gt; [options]

       <b>command</b>  should  be  one  of the commands listed in this document.  <b>options</b>, which is optional, should be
       zero or more of the options available for the given command.

   <b>Getting</b> <b>runtime</b> <b>help</b>
       <b>django-admin</b> <b>help</b>

       Run <b>django-admin</b> <b>help</b> to display  usage  information  and  a  list  of  the  commands  provided  by  each
       application.

       Run <b>django-admin</b> <b>help</b> <b>--commands</b> to display a list of all available commands.

       Run <b>django-admin</b> <b>help</b> <b>&lt;command&gt;</b> to display a description of the given command and a list of its available
       options.

   <b>App</b> <b>names</b>
       Many  commands  take  a list of "app names." An "app name" is the basename of the package containing your
       models. For example, if your <u>INSTALLED_APPS</u> contains the string <b>'mysite.blog'</b>, the app name is <b>blog</b>.

   <b>Determining</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b>
       <b>django-admin</b> <b>version</b>

       Run <b>django-admin</b> <b>version</b> to display the current Django version.

       The output follows the schema described in <u>PEP</u> <u>440</u>:

          1.4.dev17026
          1.4a1
          1.4

   <b>Displaying</b> <b>debug</b> <b>output</b>
       Use <u>--verbosity</u>, where it is supported, to specify the amount of notification and debug information  that
       <b>django-admin</b> prints to the console.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABLE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>check</b>
       <b>django-admin</b> <b>check</b> <b>[app_label</b> <b>[app_label</b> <b>...]]</b>

       Uses the <u>system</u> <u>check</u> <u>framework</u> to inspect the entire Django project for common problems.

       By default, all apps will be checked. You can check a subset of apps by providing a list of app labels as
       arguments:

          django-admin check auth admin myapp

       <b>--tag</b> <b>TAGS,</b> <b>-t</b> <b>TAGS</b>

       The  system  check  framework performs many different types of checks that are <u>categorized</u> <u>with</u> <u>tags</u>. You
       can use these tags to restrict the checks performed to just those in a particular category.  For example,
       to perform only models and compatibility checks, run:

          django-admin check --tag models --tag compatibility

       <b>--database</b> <b>DATABASE</b>

       Specifies the database to run checks requiring database access:

          django-admin check --database default --database other

       By default, these checks will not be run.

       <b>--list-tags</b>

       Lists all available tags.

       <b>--deploy</b>

       Activates some additional checks that are only relevant in a deployment setting.

       You can use this option in your local development environment, but since your local development  settings
       module  may  not have many of your production settings, you will probably want to point the <b>check</b> command
       at a different settings module, either by setting the <u>DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE</u> environment variable, or  by
       passing the <b>--settings</b> option:

          django-admin check --deploy --settings=production_settings

       Or  you  could  run it directly on a production or staging deployment to verify that the correct settings
       are in use (omitting <b>--settings</b>). You could even make it part of your integration test suite.

       <b>--fail-level</b> <b>{CRITICAL,ERROR,WARNING,INFO,DEBUG}</b>

       Specifies the message level that will cause the command to exit with a non-zero status. Default is <b>ERROR</b>.

   <b>compilemessages</b>
       <b>django-admin</b> <b>compilemessages</b>

       Compiles <b>.po</b> files created by <u>makemessages</u> to <b>.mo</b> files for use with the built-in  gettext  support.  See
       <u>Internationalization</u> <u>and</u> <u>localization</u>.

       <b>--locale</b> <b>LOCALE,</b> <b>-l</b> <b>LOCALE</b>

       Specifies the locale(s) to process. If not provided, all locales are processed.

       <b>--exclude</b> <b>EXCLUDE,</b> <b>-x</b> <b>EXCLUDE</b>

       Specifies the locale(s) to exclude from processing. If not provided, no locales are excluded.

       <b>--use-fuzzy,</b> <b>-f</b>

       Includes <u>fuzzy</u> <u>translations</u> into compiled files.

       Example usage:

          django-admin compilemessages --locale=pt_BR
          django-admin compilemessages --locale=pt_BR --locale=fr -f
          django-admin compilemessages -l pt_BR
          django-admin compilemessages -l pt_BR -l fr --use-fuzzy
          django-admin compilemessages --exclude=pt_BR
          django-admin compilemessages --exclude=pt_BR --exclude=fr
          django-admin compilemessages -x pt_BR
          django-admin compilemessages -x pt_BR -x fr

       <b>--ignore</b> <b>PATTERN,</b> <b>-i</b> <b>PATTERN</b>

       Ignores directories matching the given <u>glob</u>-style pattern. Use multiple times to ignore more.

       Example usage:

          django-admin compilemessages --ignore=cache --ignore=outdated/*/locale

   <b>createcachetable</b>
       <b>django-admin</b> <b>createcachetable</b>

       Creates the cache tables for use with the database cache backend using the information from your settings
       file. See <u>Django's</u> <u>cache</u> <u>framework</u> for more information.

       <b>--database</b> <b>DATABASE</b>

       Specifies the database in which the cache table(s) will be created. Defaults to <b>default</b>.

       <b>--dry-run</b>

       Prints  the  SQL  that  would  be  run  without  actually  running it, so you can customize it or use the
       migrations framework.

   <b>dbshell</b>
       <b>django-admin</b> <b>dbshell</b>

       Runs the command-line client for  the  database  engine  specified  in  your  <u>ENGINE</u>  setting,  with  the
       connection parameters specified in your <u>USER</u>, <u>PASSWORD</u>, etc., settings.

       • For PostgreSQL, this runs the <b>psql</b> command-line client.

       • For MySQL, this runs the <b>mysql</b> command-line client.

       • For SQLite, this runs the <b>sqlite3</b> command-line client.

       • For Oracle, this runs the <b>sqlplus</b> command-line client.

       This  command  assumes  the  programs  are  on your <b>PATH</b> so that a call to the program name (<b>psql</b>, <b>mysql</b>,
       <b>sqlite3</b>, <b>sqlplus</b>) will find the program in the right place. There's no way to specify the location of the
       program manually.

       <b>--database</b> <b>DATABASE</b>

       Specifies the database onto which to open a shell. Defaults to <b>default</b>.

       <b>--</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b>

       Any arguments following a <b>--</b> divider will be  passed  on  to  the  underlying  command-line  client.  For
       example, with PostgreSQL you can use the <b>psql</b> command's <b>-c</b> flag to execute a raw SQL query directly:

          $ django-admin dbshell -- -c 'select current_user'
           current_user
          --------------
           postgres
          (1 row)

       On MySQL/MariaDB, you can do this with the <b>mysql</b> command's <b>-e</b> flag:

          $ django-admin dbshell -- -e "select user()"
          +----------------------+
          | user()               |
          +----------------------+
          | djangonaut@localhost |
          +----------------------+

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Be  aware that not all options set in the <u>OPTIONS</u> part of your database configuration in <u>DATABASES</u> are
          passed to the command-line client, e.g. <b>'isolation_level'</b>.

   <b>diffsettings</b>
       <b>django-admin</b> <b>diffsettings</b>

       Displays differences between the current settings file and Django's default settings (or another settings
       file specified by <u>--default</u>).

       Settings that don't appear in the defaults are followed by <b>"###"</b>. For example, the default settings don't
       define <u>ROOT_URLCONF</u>, so <u>ROOT_URLCONF</u> is followed by <b>"###"</b> in the output of <b>diffsettings</b>.

       <b>--all</b>

       Displays all settings, even if they have Django's default value. Such settings are prefixed by <b>"###"</b>.

       <b>--default</b> <b>MODULE</b>

       The settings module to compare the current settings against. Leave  empty  to  compare  against  Django's
       default settings.

       <b>--output</b> <b>{hash,unified}</b>

       Specifies  the  output  format.  Available  values  are  <b>hash</b> and <b>unified</b>.  <b>hash</b> is the default mode that
       displays the output that's described above.  <b>unified</b> displays the output  similar  to  <b>diff</b>  <b>-u</b>.  Default
       settings are prefixed with a minus sign, followed by the changed setting prefixed with a plus sign.

   <b>dumpdata</b>
       <b>django-admin</b> <b>dumpdata</b> <b>[app_label[.ModelName]</b> <b>[app_label[.ModelName]</b> <b>...]]</b>

       Outputs to standard output all data in the database associated with the named application(s).

       If no application name is provided, all installed applications will be dumped.

       The output of <b>dumpdata</b> can be used as input for <u>loaddata</u>.

       When result of <b>dumpdata</b> is saved as a file, it can serve as a <u>fixture</u> for <u>tests</u> or as an <u>initial</u> <u>data</u>.

       Note  that  <b>dumpdata</b>  uses  the default manager on the model for selecting the records to dump. If you're
       using a <u>custom</u> <u>manager</u> as the default manager and it filters some of the available records,  not  all  of
       the objects will be dumped.

       <b>--all,</b> <b>-a</b>

       Uses  Django's  base  manager,  dumping records which might otherwise be filtered or modified by a custom
       manager.

       <b>--format</b> <b>FORMAT</b>

       Specifies the serialization format of the output. Defaults to  JSON.  Supported  formats  are  listed  in
       <u>Serialization</u> <u>formats</u>.

       <b>--indent</b> <b>INDENT</b>

       Specifies the number of indentation spaces to use in the output. Defaults to <b>None</b> which displays all data
       on single line.

       <b>--exclude</b> <b>EXCLUDE,</b> <b>-e</b> <b>EXCLUDE</b>

       Prevents  specific  applications  or  models  (specified  in  the form of <b>app_label.ModelName</b>) from being
       dumped. If you specify a model name, then only that model  will  be  excluded,  rather  than  the  entire
       application. You can also mix application names and model names.

       If you want to exclude multiple applications, pass <b>--exclude</b> more than once:

          django-admin dumpdata --exclude=auth --exclude=contenttypes

       <b>--database</b> <b>DATABASE</b>

       Specifies the database from which data will be dumped. Defaults to <b>default</b>.

       <b>--natural-foreign</b>

       Uses the <b>natural_key()</b> model method to serialize any foreign key and many-to-many relationship to objects
       of   the   type   that  defines  the  method.  If  you're  dumping  <b>contrib.auth</b>  <b>Permission</b>  objects  or
       <b>contrib.contenttypes</b> <b>ContentType</b> objects, you should  probably  use  this  flag.  See  the  <u>natural</u>  <u>keys</u>
       documentation for more details on this and the next option.

       <b>--natural-primary</b>

       Omits  the  primary  key  in  the  serialized  data  of  this  object  since  it can be calculated during
       deserialization.

       <b>--pks</b> <b>PRIMARY_KEYS</b>

       Outputs only the objects specified by a comma separated list of primary keys.   This  is  only  available
       when dumping one model. By default, all the records of the model are output.

       <b>--output</b> <b>OUTPUT,</b> <b>-o</b> <b>OUTPUT</b>

       Specifies a file to write the serialized data to. By default, the data goes to standard output.

       When  this  option is set and <b>--verbosity</b> is greater than 0 (the default), a progress bar is shown in the
       terminal.

   <b>Fixtures</b> <b>compression</b>
       The output file can be compressed with one of the <b>bz2</b>, <b>gz</b>, <b>lzma</b>, or <b>xz</b> formats  by  ending  the  filename
       with the corresponding extension.  For example, to output the data as a compressed JSON file:

          django-admin dumpdata -o mydata.json.gz

   <b>flush</b>
       <b>django-admin</b> <b>flush</b>

       Removes  all data from the database and re-executes any post-synchronization handlers. The table of which
       migrations have been applied is not cleared.

       If you would rather start from an empty database and rerun all migrations, you should drop  and  recreate
       the database and then run <u>migrate</u> instead.

       <b>--noinput,</b> <b>--no-input</b>

       Suppresses all user prompts.

       <b>--database</b> <b>DATABASE</b>

       Specifies the database to flush. Defaults to <b>default</b>.

   <b>inspectdb</b>
       <b>django-admin</b> <b>inspectdb</b> <b>[table</b> <b>[table</b> <b>...]]</b>

       Introspects the database tables in the database pointed-to by the <u>NAME</u> setting and outputs a Django model
       module (a <b>models.py</b> file) to standard output.

       You  may  choose what tables or views to inspect by passing their names as arguments. If no arguments are
       provided, models are created for views only if the <u>--include-views</u> option is used. Models  for  partition
       tables are created on PostgreSQL if the <u>--include-partitions</u> option is used.

       Use  this if you have a legacy database with which you'd like to use Django.  The script will inspect the
       database and create a model for each table within it.

       As you might expect, the created models will have an attribute for every field in the  table.  Note  that
       <b>inspectdb</b> has a few special cases in its field-name output:

       • If  <b>inspectdb</b> cannot map a column's type to a model field type, it'll use <b>TextField</b> and will insert the
         Python comment <b>'This</b> <b>field</b> <b>type</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>guess.'</b> next to the field in the generated model.  The  recognized
         fields  may  depend  on  apps  listed  in  <u>INSTALLED_APPS</u>.  For  example,  <u>django.contrib.postgres</u> adds
         recognition for several PostgreSQL-specific field types.

       • If the database column name is a Python reserved word (such as <b>'pass'</b>,  <b>'class'</b>  or  <b>'for'</b>),  <b>inspectdb</b>
         will  append  <b>'_field'</b> to the attribute name. For example, if a table has a column <b>'for'</b>, the generated
         model will have a field <b>'for_field'</b>, with the <b>db_column</b> attribute set to <b>'for'</b>. <b>inspectdb</b>  will  insert
         the Python comment <b>'Field</b> <b>renamed</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Python</b> <b>reserved</b> <b>word.'</b> next to the field.

       This feature is meant as a shortcut, not as definitive model generation. After you run it, you'll want to
       look  over  the generated models yourself to make customizations. In particular, you'll need to rearrange
       models' order, so that models that refer to other models are ordered properly.

       Django doesn't create database defaults when a  <u>default</u>  is  specified  on  a  model  field.   Similarly,
       database defaults aren't translated to model field defaults or detected in any fashion by <b>inspectdb</b>.

       By  default, <b>inspectdb</b> creates unmanaged models. That is, <b>managed</b> <b>=</b> <b>False</b> in the model's <b>Meta</b> class tells
       Django not to manage each table's creation, modification, and deletion. If you do want to allow Django to
       manage the table's lifecycle, you'll need to change the <u>managed</u> option to <b>True</b> (or remove it because <b>True</b>
       is its default value).

   <b>Database-specific</b> <b>notes</b>
   <b>Oracle</b>
       • Models are created for materialized views if <u>--include-views</u> is used.

   <b>PostgreSQL</b>
       • Models are created for foreign tables.

       • Models are created for materialized views if <u>--include-views</u> is used.

       • Models are created for partition tables if <u>--include-partitions</u> is used.

       <b>--database</b> <b>DATABASE</b>

       Specifies the database to introspect. Defaults to <b>default</b>.

       <b>--include-partitions</b>

       If this option is provided, models are also created for partitions.

       Only support for PostgreSQL is implemented.

       <b>--include-views</b>

       If this option is provided, models are also created for database views.

   <b>loaddata</b>
       <b>django-admin</b> <b>loaddata</b> <b>fixture</b> <b>[fixture</b> <b>...]</b>

       Searches for and loads the contents of the named <u>fixture</u> into the database.

       <b>--database</b> <b>DATABASE</b>

       Specifies the database into which the data will be loaded. Defaults to <b>default</b>.

       <b>--ignorenonexistent,</b> <b>-i</b>

       Ignores fields and models that may have been removed since the fixture was originally generated.

       <b>--app</b> <b>APP_LABEL</b>

       Specifies a single app to look for fixtures in rather than looking in all apps.

       <b>--format</b> <b>FORMAT</b>

       Specifies the <u>serialization</u> <u>format</u> (e.g., <b>json</b> or <b>xml</b>) for fixtures <u>read</u> <u>from</u> <u>stdin</u>.

       <b>--exclude</b> <b>EXCLUDE,</b> <b>-e</b> <b>EXCLUDE</b>

       Excludes loading the fixtures from the given applications and/or models (in  the  form  of  <b>app_label</b>  or
       <b>app_label.ModelName</b>). Use the option multiple times to exclude more than one app or model.

   <b>Loading</b> <b>fixtures</b> <b>from</b> <b>stdin</b>
       You can use a dash as the fixture name to load input from <b>sys.stdin</b>. For example:

          django-admin loaddata --format=json -

       When reading from <b>stdin</b>, the <u>--format</u> option is required to specify the <u>serialization</u> <u>format</u> of the input
       (e.g., <b>json</b> or <b>xml</b>).

       Loading from <b>stdin</b> is useful with standard input and output redirections.  For example:

          django-admin dumpdata --format=json --database=test app_label.ModelName | django-admin loaddata --format=json --database=prod -

       The <u>dumpdata</u> command can be used to generate input for <b>loaddata</b>.

       <b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO:</b>
          For more detail about fixtures see the <u>Fixtures</u> topic.

   <b>makemessages</b>
       <b>django-admin</b> <b>makemessages</b>

       Runs  over  the  entire  source  tree  of  the  current  directory  and  pulls out all strings marked for
       translation. It creates (or updates) a message file in the conf/locale (in the  Django  tree)  or  locale
       (for  project  and application) directory. After making changes to the messages files you need to compile
       them with <u>compilemessages</u> for use with the builtin  gettext  support.  See  the  <u>i18n</u>  <u>documentation</u>  for
       details.

       This  command  doesn't require configured settings. However, when settings aren't configured, the command
       can't ignore the <u>MEDIA_ROOT</u> and <u>STATIC_ROOT</u> directories or include <u>LOCALE_PATHS</u>.

       <b>--all,</b> <b>-a</b>

       Updates the message files for all available languages.

       <b>--extension</b> <b>EXTENSIONS,</b> <b>-e</b> <b>EXTENSIONS</b>

       Specifies a list of file extensions to examine (default: <b>html</b>, <b>txt</b>, <b>py</b> or <b>js</b> if <u>--domain</u> is <b>js</b>).

       Example usage:

          django-admin makemessages --locale=de --extension xhtml

       Separate multiple extensions with commas or use <b>-e</b> or <b>--extension</b> multiple times:

          django-admin makemessages --locale=de --extension=html,txt --extension xml

       <b>--locale</b> <b>LOCALE,</b> <b>-l</b> <b>LOCALE</b>

       Specifies the locale(s) to process.

       <b>--exclude</b> <b>EXCLUDE,</b> <b>-x</b> <b>EXCLUDE</b>

       Specifies the locale(s) to exclude from processing. If not provided, no locales are excluded.

       Example usage:

          django-admin makemessages --locale=pt_BR
          django-admin makemessages --locale=pt_BR --locale=fr
          django-admin makemessages -l pt_BR
          django-admin makemessages -l pt_BR -l fr
          django-admin makemessages --exclude=pt_BR
          django-admin makemessages --exclude=pt_BR --exclude=fr
          django-admin makemessages -x pt_BR
          django-admin makemessages -x pt_BR -x fr

       <b>--domain</b> <b>DOMAIN,</b> <b>-d</b> <b>DOMAIN</b>

       Specifies the domain of the messages files. Supported options are:

       • <b>django</b> for all <b>*.py</b>, <b>*.html</b> and <b>*.txt</b> files (default)

       • <b>djangojs</b> for <b>*.js</b> files

       <b>--symlinks,</b> <b>-s</b>

       Follows symlinks to directories when looking for new translation strings.

       Example usage:

          django-admin makemessages --locale=de --symlinks

       <b>--ignore</b> <b>PATTERN,</b> <b>-i</b> <b>PATTERN</b>

       Ignores files or directories matching the given <u>glob</u>-style pattern. Use multiple times to ignore more.

       These patterns are used by default: <b>'CVS'</b>, <b>'.*'</b>, <b>'*~'</b>, <b>'*.pyc'</b>.

       Example usage:

          django-admin makemessages --locale=en_US --ignore=apps/* --ignore=secret/*.html

       <b>--no-default-ignore</b>

       Disables the default values of <b>--ignore</b>.

       <b>--no-wrap</b>

       Disables breaking long message lines into several lines in language files.

       <b>--no-location</b>

       Suppresses writing '<b>#:</b> <b>filename:line</b>’ comment lines in language files.  Using this option makes it harder
       for technically skilled translators to understand each message's context.

       <b>--add-location</b> <b>[{full,file,never}]</b>

       Controls <b>#:</b> <b>filename:line</b> comment lines in language files. If the option is:

       • <b>full</b> (the default if not given): the lines include both file name and line number.

       • <b>file</b>: the line number is omitted.

       • <b>never</b>: the lines are suppressed (same as <u>--no-location</u>).

       Requires <b>gettext</b> 0.19 or newer.

       <b>--keep-pot</b>

       Prevents deleting the temporary <b>.pot</b> files generated before creating the <b>.po</b> file.  This  is  useful  for
       debugging errors which may prevent the final language files from being created.

       <b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO:</b>
          See  <u>Customizing</u>  <u>the</u>  <u>makemessages</u>  <u>command</u>  for  instructions  on how to customize the keywords that
          <u>makemessages</u> passes to <b>xgettext</b>.

   <b>makemigrations</b>
       <b>django-admin</b> <b>makemigrations</b> <b>[app_label</b> <b>[app_label</b> <b>...]]</b>

       Creates new migrations based on the changes detected to your models.  Migrations, their relationship with
       apps and more are covered in depth in <u>the</u> <u>migrations</u> <u>documentation</u>.

       Providing one or more app names as arguments will limit the migrations created to  the  app(s)  specified
       and any dependencies needed (the table at the other end of a <b>ForeignKey</b>, for example).

       To  add  migrations to an app that doesn't have a <b>migrations</b> directory, run <b>makemigrations</b> with the app's
       <b>app_label</b>.

       <b>--noinput,</b> <b>--no-input</b>

       Suppresses all user prompts. If a suppressed prompt cannot be resolved automatically,  the  command  will
       exit with error code 3.

       <b>--empty</b>

       Outputs  an  empty  migration  for the specified apps, for manual editing. This is for advanced users and
       should not be used unless you are familiar with the  migration  format,  migration  operations,  and  the
       dependencies between your migrations.

       <b>--dry-run</b>

       Shows  what  migrations  would  be made without actually writing any migrations files to disk. Using this
       option along with <b>--verbosity</b> <b>3</b> will also show the complete migrations files that would be written.

       <b>--merge</b>

       Enables fixing of migration conflicts.

       <b>--name</b> <b>NAME,</b> <b>-n</b> <b>NAME</b>

       Allows naming the generated migration(s) instead of using a generated name. The  name  must  be  a  valid
       Python <u>identifier</u>.

       <b>--no-header</b>

       Generate migration files without Django version and timestamp header.

       <b>--check</b>

       Makes <b>makemigrations</b> exit with a non-zero status when model changes without migrations are detected.

       In older versions, the missing migrations were also created when using the <b>--check</b> option.

       <b>--scriptable</b>

       Diverts  log  output  and  input  prompts  to  <b>stderr</b>, writing only paths of generated migration files to
       <b>stdout</b>.

       <b>--update</b>

       Merges model changes into the latest migration and optimize the resulting operations.

   <b>migrate</b>
       <b>django-admin</b> <b>migrate</b> <b>[app_label]</b> <b>[migration_name]</b>

       Synchronizes the database state with the  current  set  of  models  and  migrations.   Migrations,  their
       relationship with apps and more are covered in depth in <u>the</u> <u>migrations</u> <u>documentation</u>.

       The behavior of this command changes depending on the arguments provided:

       • No arguments: All apps have all of their migrations run.

       • <b>&lt;app_label&gt;</b>:  The  specified  app  has  its  migrations  run, up to the most recent migration. This may
         involve running other apps' migrations too, due to dependencies.

       • <b>&lt;app_label&gt;</b> <b>&lt;migrationname&gt;</b>: Brings the database schema  to  a  state  where  the  named  migration  is
         applied, but no later migrations in the same app are applied. This may involve unapplying migrations if
         you have previously migrated past the named migration. You can use a prefix of the migration name, e.g.
         <b>0001</b>, as long as it's unique for the given app name. Use the name <b>zero</b> to migrate all the way back i.e.
         to revert all applied migrations for an app.

       <b>WARNING:</b>
          When   unapplying  migrations,  all  dependent  migrations  will  also  be  unapplied,  regardless  of
          <b>&lt;app_label&gt;</b>. You can use <b>--plan</b> to check which migrations will be unapplied.

       <b>--database</b> <b>DATABASE</b>

       Specifies the database to migrate. Defaults to <b>default</b>.

       <b>--fake</b>

       Marks the migrations up to the target one (following the rules above) as applied,  but  without  actually
       running the SQL to change your database schema.

       This  is  intended  for  advanced  users  to  manipulate  the current migration state directly if they're
       manually applying changes; be warned that using <b>--fake</b> runs the risk of putting the migration state table
       into a state where manual recovery will be needed to make migrations run correctly.

       <b>--fake-initial</b>

       Allows Django to skip an app's initial migration if all database tables with  the  names  of  all  models
       created  by  all  <u>CreateModel</u> operations in that migration already exist. This option is intended for use
       when first running migrations against a database that preexisted the use of migrations. This option  does
       not,  however,  check for matching database schema beyond matching table names and so is only safe to use
       if you are confident that your existing schema matches what is recorded in your initial migration.

       <b>--plan</b>

       Shows the migration operations that will be performed for the given <b>migrate</b> command.

       <b>--run-syncdb</b>

       Allows creating tables for  apps  without  migrations.  While  this  isn't  recommended,  the  migrations
       framework is sometimes too slow on large projects with hundreds of models.

       <b>--noinput,</b> <b>--no-input</b>

       Suppresses all user prompts. An example prompt is asking about removing stale content types.

       <b>--check</b>

       Makes <b>migrate</b> exit with a non-zero status when unapplied migrations are detected.

       <b>--prune</b>

       Deletes  nonexistent  migrations  from  the  <b>django_migrations</b> table. This is useful when migration files
       replaced by a squashed migration have been removed.  See <u>Squashing</u> <u>migrations</u> for more details.

   <b>optimizemigration</b>
       <b>django-admin</b> <b>optimizemigration</b> <b>app_label</b> <b>migration_name</b>

       Optimizes the operations for the named migration and  overrides  the  existing  file.  If  the  migration
       contains  functions  that must be manually copied, the command creates a new migration file suffixed with
       <b>_optimized</b> that is meant to replace the named migration.

       <b>--check</b>

       Makes <b>optimizemigration</b> exit with a non-zero status when a migration can be optimized.

   <b>runserver</b>
       <b>django-admin</b> <b>runserver</b> <b>[addrport]</b>

       Starts a lightweight development web server on the local machine. By default, the  server  runs  on  port
       8000 on the IP address <b>127.0.0.1</b>. You can pass in an IP address and port number explicitly.

       If you run this script as a user with normal privileges (recommended), you might not have access to start
       a port on a low port number. Low port numbers are reserved for the superuser (root).

       This server uses the WSGI application object specified by the <u>WSGI_APPLICATION</u> setting.

       DO  NOT  USE  THIS SERVER IN A PRODUCTION SETTING. It has not gone through security audits or performance
       tests. (And that's how it's gonna stay. We're in the business of making web frameworks, not web  servers,
       so improving this server to be able to handle a production environment is outside the scope of Django.)

       The  development  server automatically reloads Python code for each request, as needed. You don't need to
       restart the server for code changes to take effect.   However,  some  actions  like  adding  files  don't
       trigger a restart, so you'll have to restart the server in these cases.

       If  you're using Linux or MacOS and install both <u>pywatchman</u> and the <u>Watchman</u> service, kernel signals will
       be used to autoreload the server (rather than polling file modification  timestamps  each  second).  This
       offers better performance on large projects, reduced response time after code changes, more robust change
       detection, and a reduction in power usage. Django supports <b>pywatchman</b> 1.2.0 and higher.

          Large directories with many files may cause performance issues

                 When   using   Watchman  with  a  project  that  includes  large  non-Python  directories  like
                 <b>node_modules</b>, it's advisable to ignore this directory for optimal performance. See the <u>watchman</u>
                 <u>documentation</u> for information on how to do this.

          Watchman timeout

          <b>DJANGO_WATCHMAN_TIMEOUT</b>

          The  default  timeout  of  <b>Watchman</b>  client  is  5  seconds.  You  can  change  it  by   setting   the
          <u>DJANGO_WATCHMAN_TIMEOUT</u> environment variable.

       When  you  start the server, and each time you change Python code while the server is running, the system
       check framework will check your entire Django project for some common errors (see the <u>check</u> command).  If
       any  errors  are  found, they will be printed to standard output. You can use the <b>--skip-checks</b> option to
       skip running system checks.

       You can run as many concurrent servers as you want, as long as they're on  separate  ports  by  executing
       <b>django-admin</b> <b>runserver</b> more than once.

       Note  that  the  default IP address, <b>127.0.0.1</b>, is not accessible from other machines on your network. To
       make your development server viewable to other machines on the network, use  its  own  IP  address  (e.g.
       <b>192.168.2.1</b>), <b>0</b> (shortcut for <b>0.0.0.0</b>), <b>0.0.0.0</b>, or <b>::</b> (with IPv6 enabled).

       You  can  provide  an  IPv6 address surrounded by brackets (e.g. <b>[200a::1]:8000</b>). This will automatically
       enable IPv6 support.

       A hostname containing ASCII-only characters can also be used.

       If the <u>staticfiles</u> contrib app is enabled (default  in  new  projects)  the  <u>runserver</u>  command  will  be
       overridden with its own <u>runserver</u> command.

       Logging of each request and response of the server is sent to the <u>django.server</u> logger.

       <b>--noreload</b>

       Disables  the auto-reloader. This means any Python code changes you make while the server is running will
       <u>not</u> take effect if the particular Python modules have already been loaded into memory.

       <b>--nothreading</b>

       Disables use of threading in the development server. The server is multithreaded by default.

       <b>--ipv6,</b> <b>-6</b>

       Uses IPv6 for the development server. This changes the default IP address from <b>127.0.0.1</b> to <b>::1</b>.

   <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> <b>different</b> <b>ports</b> <b>and</b> <b>addresses</b>
       Port 8000 on IP address <b>127.0.0.1</b>:

          django-admin runserver

       Port 8000 on IP address <b>1.2.3.4</b>:

          django-admin runserver 1.2.3.4:8000

       Port 7000 on IP address <b>127.0.0.1</b>:

          django-admin runserver 7000

       Port 7000 on IP address <b>1.2.3.4</b>:

          django-admin runserver 1.2.3.4:7000

       Port 8000 on IPv6 address <b>::1</b>:

          django-admin runserver -6

       Port 7000 on IPv6 address <b>::1</b>:

          django-admin runserver -6 7000

       Port 7000 on IPv6 address <b>2001:0db8:1234:5678::9</b>:

          django-admin runserver [2001:0db8:1234:5678::9]:7000

       Port 8000 on IPv4 address of host <b>localhost</b>:

          django-admin runserver localhost:8000

       Port 8000 on IPv6 address of host <b>localhost</b>:

          django-admin runserver -6 localhost:8000

   <b>Serving</b> <b>static</b> <b>files</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>server</b>
       By default, the development server doesn't serve any static files for  your  site  (such  as  CSS  files,
       images, things under <u>MEDIA_URL</u> and so forth). If you want to configure Django to serve static media, read
       <u>How</u> <u>to</u> <u>manage</u> <u>static</u> <u>files</u> <u>(e.g.</u> <u>images,</u> <u>JavaScript,</u> <u>CSS)</u>.

   <b>Serving</b> <b>with</b> <b>ASGI</b> <b>in</b> <b>development</b>
       Django's  <b>runserver</b>  command  provides  a WSGI server. In order to run under ASGI you will need to use an
       <u>ASGI</u> <u>server</u>.  The Django Daphne project provides <u>Integration</u> <u>with</u> <u>runserver</u> that you can use.

   <b>sendtestemail</b>
       <b>django-admin</b> <b>sendtestemail</b> <b>[email</b> <b>[email</b> <b>...]]</b>

       Sends a test email (to confirm email sending through Django is working) to  the  recipient(s)  specified.
       For example:

          django-admin sendtestemail <a href="mailto:foo@example.com">foo@example.com</a> <a href="mailto:bar@example.com">bar@example.com</a>

       There are a couple of options, and you may use any combination of them together:

       <b>--managers</b>

       Mails the email addresses specified in <u>MANAGERS</u> using <u>mail_managers()</u>.

       <b>--admins</b>

       Mails the email addresses specified in <u>ADMINS</u> using <u>mail_admins()</u>.

   <b>shell</b>
       <b>django-admin</b> <b>shell</b>

       Starts the Python interactive interpreter.

       <b>--interface</b> <b>{ipython,bpython,python},</b> <b>-i</b> <b>{ipython,bpython,python}</b>

       Specifies  the  shell  to  use. By default, Django will use <u>IPython</u> or <u>bpython</u> if either is installed. If
       both are installed, specify which one you want like so:

       IPython:

          django-admin shell -i ipython

       bpython:

          django-admin shell -i bpython

       If you have a "rich" shell installed but want to force use of the "plain" Python interpreter, use  <b>python</b>
       as the interface name, like so:

          django-admin shell -i python

       <b>--nostartup</b>

       Disables reading the startup script for the "plain" Python interpreter. By default, the script pointed to
       by the <u>PYTHONSTARTUP</u> environment variable or the <b><a href="file:~/.pythonrc.py">~/.pythonrc.py</a></b> script is read.

       <b>--command</b> <b>COMMAND,</b> <b>-c</b> <b>COMMAND</b>

       Lets you pass a command as a string to execute it as Django, like so:

          django-admin shell --command="import django; print(django.__version__)"

       You can also pass code in on standard input to execute it. For example:

          $ django-admin shell &lt;&lt;EOF
          &gt; import django
          &gt; print(django.__version__)
          &gt; EOF

       On Windows, the REPL is output due to implementation limits of <u>select.select()</u> on that platform.

   <b>showmigrations</b>
       <b>django-admin</b> <b>showmigrations</b> <b>[app_label</b> <b>[app_label</b> <b>...]]</b>

       Shows all migrations in a project. You can choose from one of two formats:

       <b>--list,</b> <b>-l</b>

       Lists  all of the apps Django knows about, the migrations available for each app, and whether or not each
       migration is applied (marked by an <b>[X]</b> next to the migration name). For a <b>--verbosity</b> of 2 and above, the
       applied datetimes are also shown.

       Apps without migrations are also listed, but have <b>(no</b> <b>migrations)</b> printed under them.

       This is the default output format.

       <b>--plan,</b> <b>-p</b>

       Shows the migration plan Django will follow to apply migrations.  Like  <b>--list</b>,  applied  migrations  are
       marked by an <b>[X]</b>. For a <b>--verbosity</b> of 2 and above, all dependencies of a migration will also be shown.

       <b>app_label</b>s arguments limit the output, however, dependencies of provided apps may also be included.

       <b>--database</b> <b>DATABASE</b>

       Specifies the database to examine. Defaults to <b>default</b>.

   <b>sqlflush</b>
       <b>django-admin</b> <b>sqlflush</b>

       Prints the SQL statements that would be executed for the <u>flush</u> command.

       <b>--database</b> <b>DATABASE</b>

       Specifies the database for which to print the SQL. Defaults to <b>default</b>.

   <b>sqlmigrate</b>
       <b>django-admin</b> <b>sqlmigrate</b> <b>app_label</b> <b>migration_name</b>

       Prints the SQL for the named migration. This requires an active database connection, which it will use to
       resolve constraint names; this means you must generate the SQL against a copy of the database you wish to
       later apply it on.

       Note that <b>sqlmigrate</b> doesn't colorize its output.

       <b>--backwards</b>

       Generates  the SQL for unapplying the migration. By default, the SQL created is for running the migration
       in the forwards direction.

       <b>--database</b> <b>DATABASE</b>

       Specifies the database for which to generate the SQL. Defaults to <b>default</b>.

   <b>sqlsequencereset</b>
       <b>django-admin</b> <b>sqlsequencereset</b> <b>app_label</b> <b>[app_label</b> <b>...]</b>

       Prints the SQL statements for resetting sequences for the given app name(s).

       Sequences are indexes used by some database engines to track the next available number for  automatically
       incremented fields.

       Use  this  command  to  generate  SQL  which  will  fix  cases  where  a sequence is out of sync with its
       automatically incremented field data.

       <b>--database</b> <b>DATABASE</b>

       Specifies the database for which to print the SQL. Defaults to <b>default</b>.

   <b>squashmigrations</b>
       <b>django-admin</b> <b>squashmigrations</b> <b>app_label</b> <b>[start_migration_name]</b> <b>migration_name</b>

       Squashes the migrations for <b>app_label</b> up to and including <b>migration_name</b> down into fewer  migrations,  if
       possible.  The  resulting  squashed  migrations  can  live alongside the unsquashed ones safely. For more
       information, please read <u>Squashing</u> <u>migrations</u>.

       When <b>start_migration_name</b> is given, Django will only include migrations starting from and including  this
       migration.    This    helps    to    mitigate    the    squashing    limitation    of    <u>RunPython</u>    and
       <u>django.db.migrations.operations.RunSQL</u> migration operations.

       <b>--no-optimize</b>

       Disables the optimizer when generating a squashed migration. By default, Django will try to optimize  the
       operations  in  your migrations to reduce the size of the resulting file. Use this option if this process
       is failing or creating incorrect migrations, though please also  file  a  Django  bug  report  about  the
       behavior, as optimization is meant to be safe.

       <b>--noinput,</b> <b>--no-input</b>

       Suppresses all user prompts.

       <b>--squashed-name</b> <b>SQUASHED_NAME</b>

       Sets the name of the squashed migration. When omitted, the name is based on the first and last migration,
       with <b>_squashed_</b> in between.

       <b>--no-header</b>

       Generate squashed migration file without Django version and timestamp header.

   <b>startapp</b>
       <b>django-admin</b> <b>startapp</b> <b>name</b> <b>[directory]</b>

       Creates  a  Django  app  directory structure for the given app name in the current directory or the given
       destination.

       By default, <u>the</u> <u>new</u> <u>directory</u> contains a <b>models.py</b> file and other app template files.  If  only  the  app
       name is given, the app directory will be created in the current working directory.

       If  the  optional destination is provided, Django will use that existing directory rather than creating a
       new one. You can use '.' to denote the current working directory.

       For example:

          django-admin startapp myapp /Users/jezdez/Code/myapp

       <b>--template</b> <b>TEMPLATE</b>

       Provides the path to a directory with a custom app template file, or a path to  an  uncompressed  archive
       (<b>.tar</b>)  or  a  compressed  archive (<b>.tar.gz</b>, <b>.tar.bz2</b>, <b>.tar.xz</b>, <b>.tar.lzma</b>, <b>.tgz</b>, <b>.tbz2</b>, <b>.txz</b>, <b>.tlz</b>, <b>.zip</b>)
       containing the app template files.

       For example, this would look for an app template in the given directory when creating the <b>myapp</b> app:

          django-admin startapp --template=/Users/jezdez/Code/my_app_template myapp

       Django will also accept URLs (<b>http</b>, <b>https</b>, <b>ftp</b>) to compressed  archives  with  the  app  template  files,
       downloading and extracting them on the fly.

       For  example, taking advantage of GitHub's feature to expose repositories as zip files, you can use a URL
       like:

          django-admin startapp --template=https://github.com/githubuser/django-app-template/archive/main.zip myapp

       <b>--extension</b> <b>EXTENSIONS,</b> <b>-e</b> <b>EXTENSIONS</b>

       Specifies which file extensions in the app template should be rendered with the template engine. Defaults
       to <b>py</b>.

       <b>--name</b> <b>FILES,</b> <b>-n</b> <b>FILES</b>

       Specifies which files in the app template (in addition to those matching <b>--extension</b>) should be  rendered
       with the template engine. Defaults to an empty list.

       <b>--exclude</b> <b>DIRECTORIES,</b> <b>-x</b> <b>DIRECTORIES</b>

       Specifies  which directories in the app template should be excluded, in addition to <b>.git</b> and <b>__pycache__</b>.
       If this option is not provided, directories named <b>__pycache__</b> or starting with <b>.</b> will be excluded.

       The <u>template</u> <u>context</u> used for all matching files is:

       • Any option passed to the <b>startapp</b> command (among the command's supported options)

       • <b>app_name</b> -- the app name as passed to the command

       • <b>app_directory</b> -- the full path of the newly created app

       • <b>camel_case_app_name</b> -- the app name in camel case format

       • <b>docs_version</b> -- the version of the documentation: <b>'dev'</b> or <b>'1.x'</b>

       • <b>django_version</b> -- the version of Django, e.g. <b>'2.0.3'</b>

       <b>WARNING:</b>
          When the app template files are rendered with the Django template engine (by default all <b>*.py</b>  files),
          Django  will  also  replace  all stray template variables contained. For example, if one of the Python
          files contains a docstring explaining a particular feature related to  template  rendering,  it  might
          result in an incorrect example.

          To work around this problem, you can use the <u>templatetag</u> template tag to "escape" the various parts of
          the template syntax.

          In  addition,  to  allow Python template files that contain Django template language syntax while also
          preventing packaging systems from trying to byte-compile invalid <b>*.py</b>  files,  template  files  ending
          with <b>.py-tpl</b> will be renamed to <b>.py</b>.

       <b>WARNING:</b>
          The  contents of custom app (or project) templates should always be audited before use: Such templates
          define code that will become part of your project, and this means that such code will  be  trusted  as
          much  as  any  app you install, or code you write yourself.  Further, even rendering the templates is,
          effectively, executing code that was provided as input to the management command. The Django  template
          language  may  provide wide access into the system, so make sure any custom template you use is worthy
          of your trust.

   <b>startproject</b>
       <b>django-admin</b> <b>startproject</b> <b>name</b> <b>[directory]</b>

       Creates a Django project directory structure for the given project name in the current directory  or  the
       given destination.

       By  default,  <u>the</u>  <u>new</u>  <u>directory</u>  contains <b>manage.py</b> and a project package (containing a <b>settings.py</b> and
       other files).

       If only the project name is given,  both  the  project  directory  and  project  package  will  be  named
       <b>&lt;projectname&gt;</b> and the project directory will be created in the current working directory.

       If  the  optional  destination  is  provided,  Django  will  use  that  existing directory as the project
       directory, and create <b>manage.py</b> and the project package within it. Use '.' to denote the current  working
       directory.

       For example:

          django-admin startproject myproject /Users/jezdez/Code/myproject_repo

       <b>--template</b> <b>TEMPLATE</b>

       Specifies  a  directory,  file  path,  or  URL  of a custom project template. See the <u>startapp</u> <u>--template</u>
       documentation for examples and usage.

       <b>--extension</b> <b>EXTENSIONS,</b> <b>-e</b> <b>EXTENSIONS</b>

       Specifies which file extensions in the project template should be  rendered  with  the  template  engine.
       Defaults to <b>py</b>.

       <b>--name</b> <b>FILES,</b> <b>-n</b> <b>FILES</b>

       Specifies  which  files  in  the  project  template (in addition to those matching <b>--extension</b>) should be
       rendered with the template engine. Defaults to an empty list.

       <b>--exclude</b> <b>DIRECTORIES,</b> <b>-x</b> <b>DIRECTORIES</b>

       Specifies which directories in the  project  template  should  be  excluded,  in  addition  to  <b>.git</b>  and
       <b>__pycache__</b>.  If  this  option  is not provided, directories named <b>__pycache__</b> or starting with <b>.</b> will be
       excluded.

       The <u>template</u> <u>context</u> used is:

       • Any option passed to the <b>startproject</b> command (among the command's supported options)

       • <b>project_name</b> -- the project name as passed to the command

       • <b>project_directory</b> -- the full path of the newly created project

       • <b>secret_key</b> -- a random key for the <u>SECRET_KEY</u> setting

       • <b>docs_version</b> -- the version of the documentation: <b>'dev'</b> or <b>'1.x'</b>

       • <b>django_version</b> -- the version of Django, e.g. <b>'2.0.3'</b>

       Please also see the <u>rendering</u> <u>warning</u> and <u>trusted</u> <u>code</u> <u>warning</u> as mentioned for <u>startapp</u>.

   <b>test</b>
       <b>django-admin</b> <b>test</b> <b>[test_label</b> <b>[test_label</b> <b>...]]</b>

       Runs tests for all installed apps. See <u>Testing</u> <u>in</u> <u>Django</u> for more information.

       <b>--failfast</b>

       Stops running tests and reports the failure immediately after a test fails.

       <b>--testrunner</b> <b>TESTRUNNER</b>

       Controls the test runner class that is used to execute tests. This value overrides the value provided  by
       the <u>TEST_RUNNER</u> setting.

       <b>--noinput,</b> <b>--no-input</b>

       Suppresses all user prompts. A typical prompt is a warning about deleting an existing test database.

   <b>Test</b> <b>runner</b> <b>options</b>
       The  <b>test</b>  command receives options on behalf of the specified <u>--testrunner</u>. These are the options of the
       default test runner: <u>DiscoverRunner</u>.

       <b>--keepdb</b>

       Preserves the test database between test runs. This has the advantage of skipping  both  the  create  and
       destroy actions which can greatly decrease the time to run tests, especially those in a large test suite.
       If  the  test  database  does  not exist, it will be created on the first run and then preserved for each
       subsequent run. Unless the <u>MIGRATE</u> test setting is <b>False</b>, any unapplied migrations will also  be  applied
       to the test database before running the test suite.

       <b>--shuffle</b> <b>[SEED]</b>

       Randomizes  the  order  of  tests  before  running  them. This can help detect tests that aren't properly
       isolated. The test order generated by this option is a deterministic function of the integer seed  given.
       When no seed is passed, a seed is chosen randomly and printed to the console. To repeat a particular test
       order,  pass a seed. The test orders generated by this option preserve Django's <u>guarantees</u> <u>on</u> <u>test</u> <u>order</u>.
       They also keep tests grouped by test case class.

       The shuffled orderings also have a special consistency property  useful  when  narrowing  down  isolation
       issues.  Namely,  for a given seed and when running a subset of tests, the new order will be the original
       shuffling restricted to the smaller set. Similarly, when adding tests while keeping the  seed  the  same,
       the order of the original tests will be the same in the new order.

       <b>--reverse,</b> <b>-r</b>

       Sorts  test  cases  in the opposite execution order. This may help in debugging the side effects of tests
       that aren't properly isolated. <u>Grouping</u> <u>by</u> <u>test</u> <u>class</u> is preserved when using this option.  This  can  be
       used in conjunction with <b>--shuffle</b> to reverse the order for a particular seed.

       <b>--debug-mode</b>

       Sets the <u>DEBUG</u> setting to <b>True</b> prior to running tests. This may help troubleshoot test failures.

       <b>--debug-sql,</b> <b>-d</b>

       Enables  <u>SQL</u>  <u>logging</u>  for  failing  tests.  If  <b>--verbosity</b> is <b>2</b>, then queries in passing tests are also
       output.

       <b>--parallel</b> <b>[N]</b>

       <b>DJANGO_TEST_PROCESSES</b>

       Runs tests in separate parallel processes. Since modern  processors  have  multiple  cores,  this  allows
       running tests significantly faster.

       Using  <b>--parallel</b>  without  a  value, or with the value <b>auto</b>, runs one test process per core according to
       <u>multiprocessing.cpu_count()</u>. You can override this by passing  the  desired  number  of  processes,  e.g.
       <b>--parallel</b> <b>4</b>, or by setting the <u>DJANGO_TEST_PROCESSES</u> environment variable.

       Django  distributes  test cases — <u>unittest.TestCase</u> subclasses — to subprocesses. If there are fewer test
       cases than configured processes, Django will reduce the number of processes accordingly.

       Each process gets its own database. You must ensure that different  test  cases  don't  access  the  same
       resources.  For  instance,  test  cases that touch the filesystem should create a temporary directory for
       their own use.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          If you have test classes that cannot be run in parallel,  you  can  use  <b>SerializeMixin</b>  to  run  them
          sequentially. See <u>Enforce</u> <u>running</u> <u>test</u> <u>classes</u> <u>sequentially</u>.

       This option requires the third-party <b>tblib</b> package to display tracebacks correctly:

          $ python -m pip install tblib

       This feature isn't available on Windows. It doesn't work with the Oracle database backend either.

       If  you want to use <u>pdb</u> while debugging tests, you must disable parallel execution (<b>--parallel=1</b>). You'll
       see something like <b>bdb.BdbQuit</b> if you don't.

       <b>WARNING:</b>
          When test parallelization is enabled and a test fails, Django may be unable to display  the  exception
          traceback.  This  can  make  debugging difficult. If you encounter this problem, run the affected test
          without parallelization to see the traceback of the failure.

          This is a known limitation. It arises from the need to serialize objects in  order  to  exchange  them
          between processes. See <u>What</u> <u>can</u> <u>be</u> <u>pickled</u> <u>and</u> <u>unpickled?</u> for details.

       <b>--tag</b> <b>TAGS</b>

       Runs  only  tests <u>marked</u> <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>specified</u> <u>tags</u>.  May be specified multiple times and combined with <u>test</u>
       <u>--exclude-tag</u>.

       Tests that fail to load are always considered matching.

       <b>--exclude-tag</b> <b>EXCLUDE_TAGS</b>

       Excludes tests <u>marked</u> <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>specified</u> <u>tags</u>.  May be specified multiple times and  combined  with  <u>test</u>
       <u>--tag</u>.

       <b>-k</b> <b>TEST_NAME_PATTERNS</b>

       Runs  test  methods and classes matching test name patterns, in the same way as <u>unittest's</u> <u>-k</u> <u>option</u>. Can
       be specified multiple times.

       <b>--pdb</b>

       Spawns a <b>pdb</b> debugger at each test error or failure. If you have it installed, <b>ipdb</b> is used instead.

       <b>--buffer,</b> <b>-b</b>

       Discards output (<b>stdout</b> and <b>stderr</b>) for passing tests, in the same way as <u>unittest's</u> <u>--buffer</u> <u>option</u>.

       <b>--no-faulthandler</b>

       Django automatically calls <u>faulthandler.enable()</u> when starting the tests, which  allows  it  to  print  a
       traceback if the interpreter crashes. Pass <b>--no-faulthandler</b> to disable this behavior.

       <b>--timing</b>

       Outputs timings, including database setup and total run time.

   <b>testserver</b>
       <b>django-admin</b> <b>testserver</b> <b>[fixture</b> <b>[fixture</b> <b>...]]</b>

       Runs a Django development server (as in <u>runserver</u>) using data from the given fixture(s).

       For example, this command:

          django-admin testserver mydata.json

       ...would perform the following steps:

       1. Create a test database, as described in <u>The</u> <u>test</u> <u>database</u>.

       2. Populate  the test database with fixture data from the given fixtures.  (For more on fixtures, see the
          documentation for <u>loaddata</u> above.)

       3. Runs the Django development server (as in <u>runserver</u>), pointed at  this  newly  created  test  database
          instead of your production database.

       This is useful in a number of ways:

       • When  you're writing <u>unit</u> <u>tests</u> of how your views act with certain fixture data, you can use <b>testserver</b>
         to interact with the views in a web browser, manually.

       • Let's say you're developing your Django application and have a "pristine" copy of a database that you'd
         like to interact with. You can dump your database to a <u>fixture</u> (using the <u>dumpdata</u>  command,  explained
         above),  then  use  <b>testserver</b>  to run your web application with that data.  With this arrangement, you
         have the flexibility of messing up your data in any way, knowing  that  whatever  data  changes  you're
         making are only being made to a test database.

       Note  that  this  server  does  <u>not</u> automatically detect changes to your Python source code (as <u>runserver</u>
       does). It does, however, detect changes to templates.

       <b>--addrport</b> <b>ADDRPORT</b>

       Specifies a different port, or IP address and port,  from  the  default  of  <b>127.0.0.1:8000</b>.  This  value
       follows  exactly  the  same  format and serves exactly the same function as the argument to the <u>runserver</u>
       command.

       Examples:

       To run the test server on port 7000 with <b>fixture1</b> and <b>fixture2</b>:

          django-admin testserver --addrport 7000 fixture1 fixture2
          django-admin testserver fixture1 fixture2 --addrport 7000

       (The above statements are equivalent. We include both of them  to  demonstrate  that  it  doesn't  matter
       whether the options come before or after the fixture arguments.)

       To run on 1.2.3.4:7000 with a <b>test</b> fixture:

          django-admin testserver --addrport 1.2.3.4:7000 test

       <b>--noinput,</b> <b>--no-input</b>

       Suppresses all user prompts. A typical prompt is a warning about deleting an existing test database.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b> <b>PROVIDED</b> <b>BY</b> <b>APPLICATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Some  commands  are  only  available  when  the  <b>django.contrib</b> application that <u>implements</u> them has been
       <u>enabled</u>. This section describes them grouped by their application.

   <b>django.contrib.auth</b>
   <b>changepassword</b>
       <b>django-admin</b> <b>changepassword</b> <b>[&lt;username&gt;]</b>

       This command is only available if Django's <u>authentication</u> <u>system</u> (<b>django.contrib.auth</b>) is installed.

       Allows changing a user's password. It prompts you to enter a new password twice for the  given  user.  If
       the  entries  are  identical, this immediately becomes the new password. If you do not supply a user, the
       command will attempt to change the password whose username matches the current user.

       <b>--database</b> <b>DATABASE</b>

       Specifies the database to query for the user. Defaults to <b>default</b>.

       Example usage:

          django-admin changepassword ringo

   <b>createsuperuser</b>
       <b>django-admin</b> <b>createsuperuser</b>

       <b>DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD</b>

       This command is only available if Django's <u>authentication</u> <u>system</u> (<b>django.contrib.auth</b>) is installed.

       Creates a superuser account (a user who has all permissions). This is useful if you  need  to  create  an
       initial  superuser  account  or  if  you  need  to  programmatically generate superuser accounts for your
       site(s).

       When run interactively, this command will prompt for a password for the new superuser account.  When  run
       non-interactively,  you  can  provide  a  password  by  setting the <u>DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD</u> environment
       variable. Otherwise, no password will be set, and the superuser account will not be able to log in  until
       a password has been manually set for it.

       In  non-interactive mode, the <u>USERNAME_FIELD</u> and required fields (listed in <u>REQUIRED_FIELDS</u>) fall back to
       <b>DJANGO_SUPERUSER_&lt;uppercase_field_name&gt;</b> environment variables, unless they are overridden  by  a  command
       line  argument.  For  example,  to provide an <b>email</b> field, you can use <b>DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL</b> environment
       variable.

       <b>--noinput,</b> <b>--no-input</b>

       Suppresses all user prompts. If a suppressed prompt cannot be resolved automatically,  the  command  will
       exit with error code 1.

       <b>--username</b> <b>USERNAME</b>

       <b>--email</b> <b>EMAIL</b>

       The  username  and  email address for the new account can be supplied by using the <b>--username</b> and <b>--email</b>
       arguments on the command line. If either of those is not supplied, <b>createsuperuser</b>  will  prompt  for  it
       when running interactively.

       <b>--database</b> <b>DATABASE</b>

       Specifies the database into which the superuser object will be saved.

       You can subclass the management command and override <b>get_input_data()</b> if you want to customize data input
       and  validation.  Consult  the  source  code  for details on the existing implementation and the method's
       parameters. For example, it could be useful if you have a <b>ForeignKey</b> in <u>REQUIRED_FIELDS</u> and want to allow
       creating an instance instead of entering the primary key of an existing instance.

   <b>django.contrib.contenttypes</b>
   <b>remove_stale_contenttypes</b>
       <b>django-admin</b> <b>remove_stale_contenttypes</b>

       This command is only available if Django's <u>contenttypes</u> <u>app</u> (<u>django.contrib.contenttypes</u>) is installed.

       Deletes stale content types (from deleted models) in your  database.  Any  objects  that  depend  on  the
       deleted  content  types  will  also  be  deleted.  A list of deleted objects will be displayed before you
       confirm it's okay to proceed with the deletion.

       <b>--database</b> <b>DATABASE</b>

       Specifies the database to use. Defaults to <b>default</b>.

       <b>--include-stale-apps</b>

       Deletes stale content types including ones from previously installed apps that  have  been  removed  from
       <u>INSTALLED_APPS</u>. Defaults to <b>False</b>.

   <b>django.contrib.gis</b>
   <b>ogrinspect</b>
       This command is only available if <u>GeoDjango</u> (<b>django.contrib.gis</b>) is installed.

       Please refer to its <u>description</u> in the GeoDjango documentation.

   <b>django.contrib.sessions</b>
   <b>clearsessions</b>
       <b>django-admin</b> <b>clearsessions</b>

       Can be run as a cron job or directly to clean out expired sessions.

   <b>django.contrib.sitemaps</b>
   <b>ping_google</b>
       This command is only available if the <u>Sitemaps</u> <u>framework</u> (<b>django.contrib.sitemaps</b>) is installed.

       Please refer to its <u>description</u> in the Sitemaps documentation.

   <b>django.contrib.staticfiles</b>
   <b>collectstatic</b>
       This command is only available if the <u>static</u> <u>files</u> <u>application</u> (<b>django.contrib.staticfiles</b>) is installed.

       Please refer to its <u>description</u> in the <u>staticfiles</u> documentation.

   <b>findstatic</b>
       This command is only available if the <u>static</u> <u>files</u> <u>application</u> (<b>django.contrib.staticfiles</b>) is installed.

       Please refer to its <u>description</u> in the <u>staticfiles</u> documentation.

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Although some commands may allow their own custom options, every command allows for the following options
       by default:

       <b>--pythonpath</b> <b>PYTHONPATH</b>

       Adds  the  given  filesystem  path to the Python <u>import</u> <u>search</u> <u>path</u>. If this isn't provided, <b>django-admin</b>
       will use the <u>PYTHONPATH</u> environment variable.

       This option is unnecessary in <b>manage.py</b>, because it takes care of setting the Python path for you.

       Example usage:

          django-admin migrate --pythonpath='/home/djangoprojects/myproject'

       <b>--settings</b> <b>SETTINGS</b>

       Specifies the settings module to use. The settings module  should  be  in  Python  package  syntax,  e.g.
       <b>mysite.settings</b>.  If  this  isn't  provided, <b>django-admin</b> will use the <u>DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE</u> environment
       variable.

       This option is unnecessary in <b>manage.py</b>, because it uses <b>settings.py</b> from the current project by default.

       Example usage:

          django-admin migrate --settings=mysite.settings

       <b>--traceback</b>

       Displays a full stack trace when a <u>CommandError</u> is raised. By default, <b>django-admin</b> will  show  an  error
       message when a <b>CommandError</b> occurs and a full stack trace for any other exception.

       This option is ignored by <u>runserver</u>.

       Example usage:

          django-admin migrate --traceback

       <b>--verbosity</b> <b>{0,1,2,3},</b> <b>-v</b> <b>{0,1,2,3}</b>

       Specifies the amount of notification and debug information that a command should print to the console.

       • <b>0</b> means no output.

       • <b>1</b> means normal output (default).

       • <b>2</b> means verbose output.

       • <b>3</b> means <u>very</u> verbose output.

       This option is ignored by <u>runserver</u>.

       Example usage:

          django-admin migrate --verbosity 2

       <b>--no-color</b>

       Disables  colorized  command  output.   Some  commands  format their output to be colorized. For example,
       errors will be printed to the console in red and SQL statements will be syntax highlighted.

       Example usage:

          django-admin runserver --no-color

       <b>--force-color</b>

       Forces colorization of the command output if it would  otherwise  be  disabled  as  discussed  in  <u>Syntax</u>
       <u>coloring</u>. For example, you may want to pipe colored output to another command.

       <b>--skip-checks</b>

       Skips  running  system  checks  prior  to  running  the  command.  This  option  is only available if the
       <u>requires_system_checks</u> command attribute is not an empty list or tuple.

       Example usage:

          django-admin migrate --skip-checks

</pre><h4><b>EXTRA</b> <b>NICETIES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Syntax</b> <b>coloring</b>
       <b>DJANGO_COLORS</b>

       The <b>django-admin</b> / <b>manage.py</b> commands will use  pretty  color-coded  output  if  your  terminal  supports
       ANSI-colored  output.  It  won't  use  the  color  codes if you're piping the command's output to another
       program unless the <u>--force-color</u> option is used.

   <b>Windows</b> <b>support</b>
       On Windows 10, the <u>Windows</u>  <u>Terminal</u>  application,  <u>VS</u>  <u>Code</u>,  and  PowerShell  (where  virtual  terminal
       processing is enabled) allow colored output, and are supported by default.

       Under  Windows,  the  legacy  <b>cmd.exe</b>  native console doesn't support ANSI escape sequences so by default
       there is no color output. In this case either of two third-party libraries are needed:

       • Install <u>colorama</u>, a Python package that translates ANSI color codes  into  Windows  API  calls.  Django
         commands  will  detect  its  presence  and  will  make use of its services to color output just like on
         Unix-based platforms.  <b>colorama</b> can be installed via pip:

            ...\&gt; py -m pip install colorama

       • Install <u>ANSICON</u>, a third-party tool that allows <b>cmd.exe</b> to process ANSI color  codes.  Django  commands
         will  detect  its  presence  and  will make use of its services to color output just like on Unix-based
         platforms.

       Other modern terminal  environments  on  Windows,  that  support  terminal  colors,  but  which  are  not
       automatically  detected  as  supported  by  Django, may "fake" the installation of <b>ANSICON</b> by setting the
       appropriate environmental variable, <b>ANSICON="on"</b>.

   <b>Custom</b> <b>colors</b>
       The colors used for syntax highlighting can be customized. Django ships with three color palettes:

       • <b>dark</b>, suited to terminals that show white text on a black background. This is the default palette.

       • <b>light</b>, suited to terminals that show black text on a white background.

       • <b>nocolor</b>, which disables syntax highlighting.

       You select a palette by setting a <u>DJANGO_COLORS</u> environment variable to specify the palette you  want  to
       use.  For  example,  to  specify  the  <b>light</b>  palette  under a Unix or OS/X BASH shell, you would run the
       following at a command prompt:

          export DJANGO_COLORS="light"

       You can also customize the colors that are used. Django specifies a number of roles  in  which  color  is
       used:

       • <b>error</b> - A major error.

       • <b>notice</b> - A minor error.

       • <b>success</b> - A success.

       • <b>warning</b> - A warning.

       • <b>sql_field</b> - The name of a model field in SQL.

       • <b>sql_coltype</b> - The type of a model field in SQL.

       • <b>sql_keyword</b> - An SQL keyword.

       • <b>sql_table</b> - The name of a model in SQL.

       • <b>http_success</b> - A 2XX HTTP Success server response.

       • <b>http_not_modified</b> - A 304 HTTP Not Modified server response.

       • <b>http_redirect</b> - A 3XX HTTP Redirect server response other than 304.

       • <b>http_not_found</b> - A 404 HTTP Not Found server response.

       • <b>http_bad_request</b> - A 4XX HTTP Bad Request server response other than 404.

       Each of these roles can be assigned a specific foreground and background color, from the following list:

       • <b>black</b>

       • <b>red</b>

       • <b>green</b>

       • <b>yellow</b>

       • <b>blue</b>

       • <b>magenta</b>

       • <b>cyan</b>

       • <b>white</b>

       Each of these colors can then be modified by using the following display options:

       • <b>bold</b>

       • <b>underscore</b>

       • <b>blink</b>

       • <b>reverse</b>

       • <b>conceal</b>

       A color specification follows one of the following patterns:

       • <b>role=fg</b>

       • <b>role=fg/bg</b>

       • <b>role=fg,option,option</b>

       • <b>role=fg/bg,option,option</b>

       where  <b>role</b> is the name of a valid color role, <b>fg</b> is the foreground color, <b>bg</b> is the background color and
       each <b>option</b> is one of the color modifying options. Multiple color specifications are then separated by  a
       semicolon. For example:

          export DJANGO_COLORS="error=yellow/blue,blink;notice=magenta"

       would  specify  that  errors  be  displayed  using  blinking  yellow on blue, and notices displayed using
       magenta. All other color roles would be left uncolored.

       Colors can also be specified by extending a  base  palette.  If  you  put  a  palette  name  in  a  color
       specification, all the colors implied by that palette will be loaded. So:

          export DJANGO_COLORS="light;error=yellow/blue,blink;notice=magenta"

       would  specify the use of all the colors in the light color palette, <u>except</u> for the colors for errors and
       notices which would be overridden as specified.

   <b>Bash</b> <b>completion</b>
       If you use the Bash shell, consider  installing  the  Django  bash  completion  script,  which  lives  in
       <u>extras/django_bash_completion</u>   in   the   Django  source  distribution.  It  enables  tab-completion  of
       <b>django-admin</b> and <b>manage.py</b> commands, so you can, for instance...

       • Type <b>django-admin</b>.

       • Press [TAB] to see all available options.

       • Type <b>sql</b>, then [TAB], to see all available options whose names start with <b>sql</b>.

       See <u>How</u> <u>to</u> <u>create</u> <u>custom</u> <u>django-admin</u> <u>commands</u> for how to add customized actions.

   <b>Black</b> <b>formatting</b>
       The  Python  files  created   by   <u>startproject</u>,   <u>startapp</u>,   <u>optimizemigration</u>,   <u>makemigrations</u>,   and
       <u>squashmigrations</u> are formatted using the <b>black</b> command if it is present on your <b>PATH</b>.

       If  you  have  <b>black</b> globally installed, but do not wish it used for the current project, you can set the
       <b>PATH</b> explicitly:

          PATH=path/to/venv/bin django-admin makemigrations

       For commands using <b>stdout</b> you can pipe the output to <b>black</b> if needed:

          django-admin inspectdb | black -

       <b>django.core.management.call_command(name,</b> <b>*args,</b> <b>**options)</b>

       To call a management command from code use <b>call_command</b>.

       <b>name</b>   the name of the command to call or a command object. Passing the  name  is  preferred  unless  the
              object is required for testing.

       <b>*args</b>  a  list  of arguments accepted by the command. Arguments are passed to the argument parser, so you
              can use the same style as you would  on  the  command  line.  For  example,  <b>call_command('flush',</b>
              <b>'--verbosity=0')</b>.

       <b>**options</b>
              named  options  accepted on the command-line. Options are passed to the command without triggering
              the  argument  parser,  which  means  you'll  need  to  pass  the  correct  type.   For   example,
              <b>call_command('flush',</b> <b>verbosity=0)</b> (zero must be an integer rather than a string).

       Examples:

          from django.core import management
          from django.core.management.commands import loaddata

          management.call_command("flush", verbosity=0, interactive=False)
          management.call_command("loaddata", "test_data", verbosity=0)
          management.call_command(loaddata.Command(), "test_data", verbosity=0)

       Note  that  command  options that take no arguments are passed as keywords with <b>True</b> or <b>False</b>, as you can
       see with the <b>interactive</b> option above.

       Named arguments can be passed by using either one of the following syntaxes:

          # Similar to the command line
          management.call_command("dumpdata", "--natural-foreign")

          # Named argument similar to the command line minus the initial dashes and
          # with internal dashes replaced by underscores
          management.call_command("dumpdata", natural_foreign=True)

          # `use_natural_foreign_keys` is the option destination variable
          management.call_command("dumpdata", use_natural_foreign_keys=True)

       Some command options have different names when using <b>call_command()</b> instead of <b>django-admin</b> or <b>manage.py</b>.
       For  example,  <b>django-admin</b>  <b>createsuperuser</b>  <b>--no-input</b>  translates  to  <b>call_command('createsuperuser',</b>
       <b>interactive=False)</b>.  To  find  what  keyword argument name to use for <b>call_command()</b>, check the command's
       source code for the <b>dest</b> argument passed to <b>parser.add_argument()</b>.

       Command options which take multiple options are passed a list:

          management.call_command("dumpdata", exclude=["contenttypes", "auth"])

       The return value of the <b>call_command()</b> function is the same as the return value of the <b>handle()</b> method of
       the command.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>REDIRECTION</b></h4><pre>
       Note that you can redirect standard output and error streams as  all  commands  support  the  <b>stdout</b>  and
       <b>stderr</b> options. For example, you could write:

          with open("/path/to/command_output", "w") as f:
              management.call_command("dumpdata", stdout=f)
