</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "perlcritic" is a Perl source code analyzer.  It is the executable front-end to the Perl::Critic engine,
       which attempts to identify awkward, hard to read, error-prone, or unconventional constructs in your code.
       Most of the rules are based on Damian Conway's book <b>Perl</b> <b>Best</b> <b>Practices</b>. However, "perlcritic" is <b>not</b>
       limited to enforcing PBP, and it will even support rules that contradict Conway.  All rules can easily be
       configured or disabled to your liking.

       This documentation only covers how to drive this command.  For all other information, such as API
       reference and alternative interfaces, please see the documentation for Perl::Critic itself.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b> <b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Before getting into all the gory details, here are some basic usage examples to help get you started.

           # Report only most severe violations (severity = 5)
           perlcritic YourModule.pm

           # Same as above, but read input from STDIN
           perlcritic

           # Recursively process all Perl files beneath directory
           perlcritic /some/directory

           # Report slightly less severe violations too (severity &gt;= 4)
           perlcritic -4 YourModule.pm

           # Same as above, but using named severity level
           perlcritic --stern YourModule.pm

           # Report all violations, regardless of severity (severity &gt;= 1)
           perlcritic -1 YourModule.pm

           # Same as above, but using named severity level
           perlcritic --brutal YourModule.pm

           # Report only violations of things from "Perl Best Practices"
           perlcritic --theme pbp YourModule.pm

           # Report top 20 most severe violations (severity &gt;= 1)
           perlcritic --top YourModule.pm

           # Report additional violations of Policies that match m/variables/xms
           perlcritic --include variables YourModule.pm

           # Use defaults from somewhere other than <a href="file:~/.perlcriticrc">~/.perlcriticrc</a>
           perlcritic --profile project/specific/perlcriticrc YourModule.pm

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       The arguments are paths to the files you wish to analyze.  You may specify multiple files.  If an
       argument is a directory, "perlcritic" will analyze all Perl files below the directory.  If no arguments
       are specified, then input is read from STDIN.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Option names can be abbreviated to uniqueness and can be stated with singe or double dashes, and option
       values can be separated from the option name by a space or '=' (as with Getopt::Long). Option names are
       also case-sensitive.

       "--profile FILE" or "-p FILE"
           Directs "perlcritic" to use a profile named by FILE rather than looking for the default <u>.perlcriticrc</u>
           file  in  the current directory or your home directory.  See "CONFIGURATION" in Perl::Critic for more
           information.

       "--noprofile"
           Directs "perlcritic" not to load any configuration file, thus reverting to the default  configuration
           for all Policies.

       "--severity N"
           Directs  "perlcritic"  to  only apply Policies with a severity greater than "N".  Severity values are
           integers ranging from 1 (least severe)  to  5  (most  severe).   The  default  is  5.   For  a  given
           "--profile",  decreasing  the  "--severity"  will  usually  produce  more violations. You can set the
           default value for this option in your <u>.perlcriticrc</u> file.  You can also redefine the  "severity"  for
           any Policy in your <u>.perlcriticrc</u> file.  See "CONFIGURATION" for more information.

       "-5 | -4 | -3 | -2 | -1"
           These  are numeric shortcuts for setting the "--severity" option.  For example, "-4" is equivalent to
           "--severity 4".  If multiple shortcuts are specified, then the most  restrictive  one  wins.   If  an
           explicit "--severity" option is also given, then all shortcut options are silently ignored.  NOTE: Be
           careful  not to put one of the number severity shortcut options immediately after the "--top" flag or
           "perlcritic" will interpret it as the number of violations to report.

       "--severity NAME"
           If it is difficult for you to remember whether severity "5" is the most or least  restrictive  level,
           then you can use one of these named values:

               SEVERITY NAME   ...is equivalent to...   SEVERITY NUMBER
               --------------------------------------------------------
               --severity gentle                           --severity 5
               --severity stern                            --severity 4
               --severity harsh                            --severity 3
               --severity cruel                            --severity 2
               --severity brutal                           --severity 1

       "--gentle | --stern | --harsh | --cruel | --brutal"
           These  are named shortcuts for setting the "--severity" option.  For example, "--cruel" is equivalent
           to "--severity 2".  If multiple shortcuts are specified, then the most restrictive one wins.   If  an
           explicit "--severity" option is also given, then all shortcut options are silently ignored.

       "--theme RULE"
           Directs  "perlcritic"  to  apply  only  Policies  with  themes  that  satisfy the "RULE".  Themes are
           arbitrary names for groups of related policies.  You can combine theme names with  boolean  operators
           to  create  an arbitrarily complex "RULE".  For example, the following would apply only Policies that
           have a 'bugs' AND 'pbp' theme:

               $&gt; perlcritic --theme='bugs &amp;&amp; pbp' MyModule.pm

           Unless  the  "--severity"  option  is  explicitly  given,  setting  "--theme"  silently  causes   the
           "--severity"  to  be  set  to 1.  You can set the default value for this option in your <u>.perlcriticrc</u>
           file. See "POLICY THEMES" in Perl::Critic for more information about themes.

       "--include PATTERN"
           Directs "perlcritic" to apply additional Policies that match  the  regex  "/PATTERN/imx".   Use  this
           option  to  temporarily  override your profile and/or the severity settings at the command-line.  For
           example:

               perlcritic --include=layout my_file.pl

           This would cause "perlcritic" to apply all the "CodeLayout::*" policies even if they have a  severity
           level  that  is  less  than the default level of 5, or have been disabled in your <u>.perlcriticrc</u> file.
           You can specify multiple "--include" options and you can use it in conjunction with  the  "--exclude"
           option.  Note that "--exclude" takes precedence over "--include" when a Policy matches both patterns.
           You can set the default value for this option in your <u>.perlcriticrc</u> file.

       "--exclude PATTERN"
           Directs  "perlcritic" to not apply any Policy that matches the regex "/PATTERN/imx".  Use this option
           to temporarily override your profile and/or the severity settings at the command-line.  For example:

               perlcritic --exclude=strict my_file.pl

           This would cause "perlcritic" to not apply the  "RequireUseStrict"  and  "ProhibitNoStrict"  Policies
           even  though  they have the highest severity level.  You can specify multiple "--exclude" options and
           you can use it in conjunction with the "--include" option.  Note that  "--exclude"  takes  precedence
           over  "--include" when a Policy matches both patterns.  You can set the default value for this option
           in your <u>.perlcriticrc</u> file.

       "--single-policy PATTERN" or "-s PATTERN"
           Directs "perlcritic" to apply just one Policy module matching the regex "/PATTERN/ixms", and  exclude
           all  other  Policies.   This  option  has  precedence  over the "--severity", "--theme", "--include",
           "--exclude", and "--only" options.  For example:

               perlcritic --single-policy=nowarnings my_file.pl

           This would cause "perlcritic" to apply  just  the  "ProhibitNoWarnings"  Policy,  regardless  of  the
           severity level setting.  No other Policies would be applied.

           This is equivalent to what one might intend by...

               perlcritic --exclude=. --include=nowarnings my_file.pl

           ... but this won't work because the "--exclude" option overrides the "--include" option.

           The  equivalent  of  this option can be accomplished by creating a custom profile containing only the
           desired policy and then running...

               perlcritic --profile=customprofile --only my_file.pl

       "--top [ N ]"
           Directs "perlcritic" to report only the top "N" Policy violations  in  each  file,  ranked  by  their
           severity.   If  "N"  is  not specified, it defaults to 20.  If the "--severity" option (or one of the
           shortcuts) is not explicitly given, the "--top" option implies that the minimum severity level is "1"
           (i.e.  "brutal"). Users can redefine the severity for any Policy in their  <u>.perlcriticrc</u>  file.   See
           "CONFIGURATION"  for  more  information.   You  can  set  the  default  value for this option in your
           <u>.perlcriticrc</u> file.  NOTE: Be careful not to put one of the  severity  shortcut  options  immediately
           after the "--top" flag or "perlcritic" will interpret it as the number of violations to report.

       "--force"
           Directs  "perlcritic"  to  ignore  the  magical  "##  no  critic" annotations in the source code. See
           "BENDING THE RULES" for more information.  You can set the default value  for  this  option  in  your
           <u>.perlcriticrc</u> file.

       "--statistics"
           Causes  several statistics about the code being scanned and the violations found to be reported after
           any other output.

       "--statistics-only"
           Like the "--statistics" option, but suppresses normal output and only shows the statistics.

       "--verbose N | FORMAT"
           Sets the verbosity level or format for reporting violations.  If given a number  ("N"),  "perlcritic"
           reports  violations  using  one  of  the  predefined  formats  described  below.   If  given a string
           ("FORMAT"), it is interpreted to be an actual format specification.  If the "--verbose" option is not
           specified, it defaults to either 4 or 5, depending on whether multiple files were given as  arguments
           to "perlcritic".  You can set the default value for this option in your <u>.perlcriticrc</u> file.

               Verbosity     Format Specification
               -----------   -------------------------------------------------------
                1            "%f:%l:%c:%m\n",
                2            "%f: (%l:%c) %m\n",
                3            "%m at %f line %l\n",
                4            "%m at line %l, column %c.  %e.  (Severity: %s)\n",
                5            "%f: %m at line %l, column %c.  %e.  (Severity: %s)\n",
                6            "%m at line %l, near '%r'.  (Severity: %s)\n",
                7            "%f: %m at line %l near '%r'.  (Severity: %s)\n",
                8            "[%p] %m at line %l, column %c.  (Severity: %s)\n",
                9            "[%p] %m at line %l, near '%r'.  (Severity: %s)\n",
               10            "%m at line %l, column %c.\n  %p (Severity: %s)\n%d\n",
               11            "%m at line %l, near '%r'.\n  %p (Severity: %s)\n%d\n"

           Formats  are  a combination of literal and escape characters similar to the way "sprintf" works.  See
           String::Format for a full explanation of the formatting capabilities.  Valid escape characters are:

               Escape    Meaning
               -------   ------------------------------------------------------------
               %c        Column number where the violation occurred
               %d        Full diagnostic discussion of the violation
               %e        Explanation of violation or page numbers in PBP
               %F        Just the name of the file where the violation occurred.
               %f        Path to the file where the violation occurred.
               %l        Line number where the violation occurred
               %m        Brief description of the violation
               %P        Full name of the Policy module that created the violation
               %p        Name of the Policy without the Perl::Critic::Policy:: prefix
               %r        The string of source code that caused the violation
               %C        The class of the PPI::Element that caused the violation
               %s        The severity level of the violation

           The purpose of these formats is to  provide  some  compatibility  with  text  editors  that  have  an
           interface  for  parsing  certain  kinds of input. See "EDITOR INTEGRATION" for more information about
           that.

       "--list"
           Displays a condensed listing of all the Perl::Critic::Policy modules that are found on this  machine.
           This  option  lists <u>all</u> Policies, regardless of your <u>.perlcriticrc</u> or command line options.  For each
           Policy, the name, default severity and default themes are shown.

       "--list-enabled"
           Displays a condensed listing of all the Perl::Critic::Policy modules that <u>would</u> be enforced,  if  you
           were  actually  going  to critique a file with this command. This is useful when you've constructed a
           complicated command or modified your <u>.perlcriticrc</u> file and you want to see  exactly  which  Policies
           are  going  to  be enforced (or not enforced, as the case may be). For each Policy, the name, default
           severity and default themes are shown.

       "--list-themes"
           Displays a list of all the themes of the Perl::Critic::Policy modules that are found on this machine.

       "--profile-proto"
           Displays an expanded listing of all the Perl::Critic::Policy modules that are found on this  machine.
           For  each Policy, the name, default severity and default themes are shown, as well as the name of any
           additional parameters that the Policy supports.  The format is  suitable  as  a  prototype  for  your
           <u>.perlcriticrc</u> file.

       "--only"
           Directs  perlcritic  to apply only Policies that are explicitly mentioned in your <u>.perlcriticrc</u> file.
           This is useful if you want to use just a small subset of Policies without having to disable  all  the
           others.  You can set the default value for this option in your <u>.perlcriticrc</u> file.

       "--profile-strictness {warn|fatal|quiet}"
           Directs  perlcritic  how  to  treat  certain  recoverable  problems  found in a <u>.perlcriticrc</u> or file
           specified via the "--profile" option. Valid values are "warn" (the default),  "fatal",  and  "quiet".
           For  example,  perlcritic  normally only warns about profiles referring to non-existent Policies, but
           this option can make this situation fatal. You can set the default value  for  this  option  in  your
           <u>.perlcriticrc</u> file.

       "--count"
       "-C"
           Display only the number of violations for each file.  Use this feature to get a quick handle on where
           a large pile of code might need the most attention.

       "--color"
       "--colour"
           This  option  is on when outputting to a tty.  When set, Severity 5 and 4 are colored red and yellow,
           respectively.  Colorization only happens if Term::ANSIColor is installed. For  Windows  environments,
           Win32::Console::ANSI  must  also be installed.  Negate this switch to disable color.  You can set the
           default value for this option in your <u>.perlcriticrc</u> file.

       "--pager PAGER_COMMAND_STRING"
           If set, perlcritic will pipe it's output to the given PAGER_COMMAND_STRING.  You can set the  default
           value for this option in your <u>.perlcriticrc</u> file.

           Setting  a pager turns off color by default.  You will have to turn color on explicitly.  If you want
           color, you'll probably also want to tell your pager  to  display  raw  characters.   For  "less"  and
           "more", use the -R switch.

       "--color-severity-highest COLOR_SPECIFICATION"
           Specifies  the  color  to  be  used  for  highest  severity  violations,  as  a Term::ANSIColor color
           specification. Can also  be  specified  as  "--colour-  severity-highest",  "--color-severity-5",  or
           "--colour-severity-5".

       "--color-severity-high COLOR_SPECIFICATION"
           Specifies   the  color  to  be  used  for  high  severity  violations,  as  a  Term::ANSIColor  color
           specification.  Can  also  be  specified  as  "--colour-  severity-high",  "--color-severity-4",   or
           "--colour-severity-4".

       "--color-severity-medium COLOR_SPECIFICATION"
           Specifies  the  color  to  be  used  for  medium  severity  violations,  as  a  Term::ANSIColor color
           specification. Can  also  be  specified  as  "--colour-  severity-medium",  "--color-severity-3",  or
           "--colour-severity-3".

       "--color-severity-low COLOR_SPECIFICATION"
           Specifies the color to be used for low severity violations, as a Term::ANSIColor color specification.
           Can also be specified as "--colour- severity-low", "--color-severity-2", or "--colour-severity-2".

       "--color-severity-lowest COLOR_SPECIFICATION"
           Specifies  the  color  to  be  used  for  lowest  severity  violations,  as  a  Term::ANSIColor color
           specification. Can  also  be  specified  as  "--colour-  severity-lowest",  "--color-severity-1",  or
           "--colour-severity-1".

       "--files-with-violations"
           Display only the names of files with violations.  Use this feature with --single-policy to find files
           that contain violations of a given policy. Can also be specified as "--l".

       "--files-without-violations"
           Display  only  the  names of files without violations.  Use this feature with --single-policy to find
           files that do not contain violations of a given policy. Can also be specified as "--L".

       "--program-extensions file_name_extension"
           Tell "perlcritic" to treat files whose names end in the given file name extension as programs, not as
           modules. If a leading '.' is desired it must be explicitly specified, e.g.

               --program-extensions .pl

           The matching is case-sensitive, and the option may be specified as many times as desired, e.g.

               --program-extensions .pl --program-extensions .cgi

           The above can also be done by quoting the file name extensions:

               --program-extensions '.pl .cgi'

           Files whose name ends in '.PL' will always be considered programs.

       "--doc PATTERN"
           Displays the perldoc for all Perl::Critic::Policy modules that match "m/PATTERN/ixms".  Since  Policy
           modules  tend  to  have  rather long names, this just provides a more convenient way to say something
           like: "perldoc Perl::Critic::Policy::ValuesAndExpressions::RequireUpperCaseHeredocTerminator" at  the
           command prompt.

       "--allow-unsafe"
           This  option  directs  "perlcritic"  to  allow the use of Policies that have been marked as "unsafe".
           Unsafe Policies may result in risky operations by compiling and executing the code they analyze.  All
           the Policies that ship in  the  core  Perl::Critic  distribution  are  safe.   However,  third  party
           Policies, such as those in the Perl::Critic::Dynamic distribution, may not be.  Note that "safety" is
           honorary  --  if a Policy author marks a Policy as safe, it is not a guarantee that it won't do nasty
           things.  <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>don't</b> <b>trust</b> <b>your</b> <b>Policies</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>code</b> <b>you</b>  <b>are</b>  <b>analyzing,</b>  <b>then</b>  <b>do</b>  <b>not</b>  <b>use</b>  <b>this</b>
           <b>switch</b>.

       "--quiet"
           Suppress the "source OK" message when no violations are found.

       "--help"
       "-?"
       "-H"
           Displays a brief summary of options and exits.

       "--options"
           Displays  the  descriptions  of the options and exits.  While this output is long, it it nowhere near
           the length of the output of "--man".

       "--man"
           Displays the complete "perlcritic" manual and exits.

       "--version"
           Displays the version number of "perlcritic" and exits.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Most of the settings for Perl::Critic and each of the Policy modules can be controlled by a configuration
       file.  The default configuration file is called <u>.perlcriticrc</u>.  "perlcritic" will look for this  file  in
       the current directory first, and then in your home directory. Alternatively, you can set the "PERLCRITIC"
       environment variable to explicitly point to a different file in another location.  If none of these files
       exist, and the "--profile" option is not given on the command-line, then all Policies will be loaded with
       their default configuration.

       The  format  of  the  configuration  file  is  a  series of INI-style blocks that contain key-value pairs
       separated by "=". Comments should start with "#" and can be placed on a separate line or after the  name-
       value pairs if you desire.

       Default  settings for perlcritic itself can be set <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>named</b> <b>block.</b> For example, putting any
       or all of these at the top of your <u>.perlcriticrc</u> file will set the default value  for  the  corresponding
       command-line argument.

           severity  = 3                                     #Integer or named level
           only      = 1                                     #Zero or One
           force     = 0                                     #Zero or One
           verbose   = 4                                     #Integer or format spec
           top       = 50                                    #A positive integer
           theme     = (pbp + security) * bugs               #A theme expression
           include   = NamingConventions ClassHierarchies    #Space-delimited list
           exclude   = Variables  Modules::RequirePackage    #Space-delimited list

       The remainder of the configuration file is a series of blocks like this:

           [Perl::Critic::Policy::Category::PolicyName]
           severity = 1
           set_themes = foo bar
           add_themes = baz
           arg1 = value1
           arg2 = value2

       "Perl::Critic::Policy::Category::PolicyName"  is  the  full  name of a module that implements the policy.
       The Policy modules distributed with Perl::Critic have been grouped into categories according to the table
       of  contents  in  Damian  Conway's  book  <b>Perl</b>  <b>Best</b>  <b>Practices</b>.  For   brevity,   you   can   omit   the
       'Perl::Critic::Policy' part of the module name.

       "severity"  is  the level of importance you wish to assign to the Policy.  All Policy modules are defined
       with a default severity value ranging from 1 (least  severe)  to  5  (most  severe).   However,  you  may
       disagree  with  the  default severity and choose to give it a higher or lower severity, based on your own
       coding philosophy.  You can set the "severity" to an integer from 1 to 5, or use one  of  the  equivalent
       names:

           SEVERITY NAME ...is equivalent to... SEVERITY NUMBER
           ----------------------------------------------------
           gentle                                             5
           stern                                              4
           harsh                                              3
           cruel                                              2
           brutal                                             1

       "set_themes"  sets the theme for the Policy and overrides its default theme.  The argument is a string of
       one or more whitespace-delimited alphanumeric words.  Themes are case-insensitive.  See  "POLICY  THEMES"
       for more information.

       "add_themes"  appends  to  the  default  themes for this Policy.  The argument is a string of one or more
       whitespace-delimited words. Themes are case- insensitive.  See "POLICY THEMES" for more information.

       The remaining key-value pairs are configuration parameters that will be passed into  the  constructor  of
       that Policy.  The constructors for most Policy modules do not support arguments, and those that do should
       have reasonable defaults.  See the documentation on the appropriate Policy module for more details.

       Instead  of redefining the severity for a given Policy, you can completely disable a Policy by prepending
       a '-' to the name of the module in your configuration file.  In this manner, the  Policy  will  never  be
       loaded, regardless of the "--severity" given on the command line.

       A simple configuration might look like this:

           #--------------------------------------------------------------
           # I think these are really important, so always load them

           [TestingAndDebugging::RequireUseStrict]
           severity = 5

           [TestingAndDebugging::RequireUseWarnings]
           severity = 5

           #--------------------------------------------------------------
           # I think these are less important, so only load when asked

           [Variables::ProhibitPackageVars]
           severity = 2

           [ControlStructures::ProhibitPostfixControls]
           allow = if unless  # My custom configuration
           severity = cruel   # Same as "severity = 2"

           #--------------------------------------------------------------
           # Give these policies a custom theme.  I can activate just
           # these policies by saying "perlcritic --theme 'larry || curly'"

           [Modules::RequireFilenameMatchesPackage]
           add_themes = larry

           [TestingAndDebugging::RequireTestLabels]
           add_themes = curly moe

           #--------------------------------------------------------------
           # I do not agree with these at all, so never load them

           [-NamingConventions::Capitalization]
           [-ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitMagicNumbers]

           #--------------------------------------------------------------
           # For all other Policies, I accept the default severity,
           # so no additional configuration is required for them.

       Note  that  all  policies included with the Perl::Critic distribution that have integer parameters accept
       underscores ("_") in their values, as with Perl numeric literals.  For example,

           [ValuesAndExpressions::RequireNumberSeparators]
           min_value = 1_000

       For additional configuration examples, see the <u>perlcriticrc</u>  file  that  is  included  in  this  <u>examples</u>
       directory of this distribution.

       Damian   Conway's   own   Perl::Critic   configuration   is   also   included  in  this  distribution  as
       <u>examples/perlcriticrc-conway</u>.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>POLICIES</b></h4><pre>
       A large number of Policy modules are distributed with Perl::Critic. They are  described  briefly  in  the
       companion  document  Perl::Critic::PolicySummary and in more detail in the individual modules themselves.
       Say "perlcritic --doc PATTERN"  to  see  the  perldoc  for  all  Policy  modules  that  match  the  regex
       "m/PATTERN/ixms"

       There  are  a  number  of distributions of additional policies on CPAN. If Perl::Critic doesn't contain a
       policy that you want, some one may have already written it.  See "SEE ALSO" in Perl::Critic for a list of
       some of these distributions.

</pre><h4><b>POLICY</b> <b>THEMES</b></h4><pre>
       Each Policy is defined with one or more "themes".  Themes can be  used  to  create  arbitrary  groups  of
       Policies.   They  are  intended  to  provide an alternative mechanism for selecting your preferred set of
       Policies. For example, you may wish disable a certain set  of  Policies  when  analyzing  test  programs.
       Conversely, you may wish to enable only a specific subset of Policies when analyzing modules.

       The  Policies  that ship with Perl::Critic are have been divided into the following themes.  This is just
       our attempt to provide some basic logical groupings.  You are free to invent new themes  that  suit  your
       needs.

           THEME             DESCRIPTION
           ------------------------------------------------------------------------
           core              All policies that ship with Perl::Critic
           pbp               Policies that come directly from "Perl Best Practices"
           bugs              Policies that that prevent or reveal bugs
           certrec           Policies that CERT recommends
           certrule          Policies that CERT considers rules
           maintenance       Policies that affect the long-term health of the code
           cosmetic          Policies that only have a superficial effect
           complexity        Policies that specifically relate to code complexity
           security          Policies that relate to security issues
           tests             Policies that are specific to test programs

       Say  "perlcritic  --list"  to  get a listing of all available policies and the themes that are associated
       with each one.  You can also change the theme for  any  Policy  in  your  <u>.perlcriticrc</u>  file.   See  the
       "CONFIGURATION" section for more information about that.

       Using the "--theme" command-line option, you can create an arbitrarily complex rule that determines which
       Policies  to  apply.  Precedence is the same as regular Perl code, and you can use parentheses to enforce
       precedence as well.  Supported operators are:

           Operator    Altertative    Example
           -----------------------------------------------------------------
           &amp;&amp;          and            'pbp &amp;&amp; core'
           ||          or             'pbp || (bugs &amp;&amp; security)'
           !           not            'pbp &amp;&amp; ! (portability || complexity)'

       Theme names are case-insensitive.  If the "--theme" is set to an empty string, then it evaluates as  true
       all Policies.

</pre><h4><b>BENDING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>RULES</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic takes a hard-line approach to your code: either you comply or you don't.  In the real world,
       it  is  not always practical (or even possible) to fully comply with coding standards.  In such cases, it
       is wise to show that you are knowingly violating the standards and that you have a Damn Good Reason (DGR)
       for doing so.

       To help with those situations, you can direct Perl::Critic to ignore certain lines or blocks of  code  by
       using annotations:

         require 'LegacyLibaray1.pl';  ## no critic
         require 'LegacyLibrary2.pl';  ## no critic

         for my $element (@list) {

             ## no critic

             $foo = "";               #Violates 'ProhibitEmptyQuotes'
             $barf = bar() if $foo;   #Violates 'ProhibitPostfixControls'
             #Some more evil code...

             ## use critic

             #Some good code...
             do_something($_);
         }

       The  "## no critic" annotations direct Perl::Critic to ignore the remaining lines of code until a "## use
       critic" annotation is found. If the "## no critic" annotation is on the same line as  a  code  statement,
       then  only  that  line  of  code  is  overlooked.   To  direct  perlcritic  to  ignore the "## no critic"
       annotations, use the "--force" option.

       A bare "## no critic" annotation disables all the active Policies.  If you wish to disable only  specific
       Policies,  add a list of Policy names as arguments just as you would for the "no strict" or "no warnings"
       pragma.  For example, this would disable the "ProhibitEmptyQuotes" and "ProhibitPostfixControls" policies
       until the end of the block or until the next "## use critic" annotation (whichever comes first):

           ## no critic (EmptyQuotes, PostfixControls);

           # Now exempt from ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitEmptyQuotes
           $foo = "";

           # Now exempt ControlStructures::ProhibitPostfixControls
           $barf = bar() if $foo;

           # Still subject to ValuesAndExpression::RequireNumberSeparators
           $long_int = 10000000000;

       Since the Policy names are matched against the "## no critic" arguments as regular expressions,  you  can
       abbreviate the Policy names or disable an entire family of Policies in one shot like this:

           ## no critic (NamingConventions)

           # Now exempt from NamingConventions::Capitalization
           my $camelHumpVar = 'foo';

           # Now exempt from NamingConventions::Capitalization
           sub camelHumpSub {}

       The  argument list must be enclosed in parentheses and must contain one or more comma-separated barewords
       (i.e. don't use quotes).  The "## no critic" annotations can be nested, and Policies named  by  an  inner
       annotation will be disabled along with those already disabled an outer annotation.

       Some  Policies  like  "Subroutines::ProhibitExcessComplexity" apply to an entire block of code.  In those
       cases, "## no critic" must appear on the line where the violation is reported.  For example:

           sub complicated_function {  ## no critic (ProhibitExcessComplexity)
               # Your code here...
           }

       Some Policies like "Documentation::RequirePodSections" apply  to  the  entire  document,  in  which  case
       violations  are reported at line 1.  But if the file requires a shebang line, it is impossible to put "##
       no critic" on the first line of the file.  This is a known limitation and  it  will  be  addressed  in  a
       future  release.   As  a workaround, you can disable the affected policies at the command-line or in your
       <u>.perlcriticrc</u> file.  But beware that this will affect the analysis of <b>all</b> files.

       Use this feature wisely.  "## no critic" should be used in  the  smallest  possible  scope,  or  only  on
       individual  lines of code. And you should always be as specific as possible about which policies you want
       to disable (i.e. never use a bare "## no critic").  If Perl::Critic complains about your  code,  try  and
       find a compliant solution before resorting to this feature.

</pre><h4><b>EDITOR</b> <b>INTEGRATION</b></h4><pre>
       For  ease-of-use,  "perlcritic"  can be integrated with your favorite text editor.  The output-formatting
       capabilities of "perlcritic" are specifically intended  for  use  with  the  "grep"  or  "compile"  modes
       available  in  editors  like "emacs" and "vim".  In these modes, you can run an arbitrary command and the
       editor will parse the output into an interactive buffer that you can click on and jump  to  the  relevant
       line of code.

       The  Perl::Critic  team  thanks everyone who has helped integrate Perl-Critic with their favorite editor.
       Your contributions in particular have made Perl- Critic a convenient  and  user-friendly  tool  for  Perl
       developers of all stripes.  We sincerely appreciate your hard work.

   <b>EMACS</b>
       Joshua  ben  Jore  has  authored  a minor-mode for emacs that allows you to run perlcritic on the current
       region or buffer.  You can run it on demand, or configure it to  run  automatically  when  you  save  the
       buffer.  The  output appears in a hot-linked compiler buffer.  The code and installation instructions can
       be found in the <u>extras</u> directory inside this distribution.

   <b>VIM</b>
       Scott      Peshak      has      published      <u>perlchecker.vim</u>,      which      is      available      at

   <b>gVIM</b>
       Fritz  Mehner  recently  added  support  for  "perlcritic"  to his fantastic gVIM plugin.  In addition to
       providing a very Perlish IDE, Fritz's plugin enables one-click access to "perlcritic" and many other very
       useful    utilities.     And    all    is    seamlessly    integrated    into     the     editor.     See
       &lt;<a href="http://lug.fh-swf.de/vim/vim-perl/screenshots-en.html">http://lug.fh-swf.de/vim/vim-perl/screenshots-en.html</a>&gt; for complete details.

   <b>Visual</b> <b>Studio</b> <b>Code</b>
       Visual  Studio  Code  is  a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is
       available for Windows, macOS and Linux.

       The           perlcritic           extension           can           be            found            here:
       &lt;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sfodje.perlcritic&gt;

       The steps to install the perlcritic extension:

       1. Menu: View-&gt;Command Palette
       2. Type in "Extensions"
       3. Select "Extensions: Install Extension"
       4. In the search box type "perlcritic" and the extensions pane will open.
       5. perlcritic should be the first entry
       6. Select the "install" button
       7. Once installed go to Preferences-&gt;Settings
       8. Type in "perlcritic" in the search box
       9. The settings options for perlcritic will show and you configure the extension here.
       9a. If you want perlcritic to run automatically when the file is saved, select "only critique on save".

       Open  a  Perl  file. Save it and perlcritic should fire. There is a triangle with an exclamation point on
       the status bar. Click it and it will open the issues that perlcritic has found.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       If "perlcritic" has any errors itself, exits with status == 1.  If there are no errors, but  "perlcritic"

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>Perl::Critic</b> <b>PHILOSOPHY</b></h4><pre>
           Coding standards are deeply personal and highly subjective.  The goal of Perl::Critic is to help  you
           write code that conforms with a set of best practices.  Our primary goal is not to dictate what those
           practices are, but rather, to implement the practices discovered by others.  Ultimately, you make the
           rules  --  Perl::Critic  is merely a tool for encouraging consistency.  If there is a policy that you
           think is important or that we have overlooked, we would be very grateful for  contributions,  or  you
           can simply load your own private set of policies into Perl::Critic.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>CRITIC</b></h4><pre>
       The  modular  design of Perl::Critic is intended to facilitate the addition of new Policies.  You'll need
       to have some understanding of PPI, but most Policy modules are pretty straightforward  and  only  require
       about  20 lines of code.  Please see the Perl::Critic::DEVELOPER file included in this distribution for a
       step-by-step demonstration of how to create new Policy modules.

       If you develop any new Policy modules, feel free to send them  to  "&lt;<a href="mailto:team@perlcritic.com">team@perlcritic.com</a>&gt;"  and  I'll  be
       happy  to  consider putting them into the Perl::Critic distribution.  Or if you would like to work on the
       Perl::Critic      project      directly,      you      can       fork       our       repository       at
       &lt;https://github.com/Perl-Critic/Perl-Critic.git&gt;.

       The  Perl::Critic team is also available for hire.  If your organization has its own coding standards, we
       can create custom Policies to enforce your local guidelines.   Or  if  your  code  base  is  prone  to  a
       particular  defect  pattern,  we can design Policies that will help you catch those costly defects <b>before</b>
       they  go  into  production.  To  discuss  your  needs  with   the   Perl::Critic   team,   just   contact
       "&lt;<a href="mailto:team@perlcritic.com">team@perlcritic.com</a>&gt;".

</pre><h4><b>CONTACTING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>DEVELOPMENT</b> <b>TEAM</b></h4><pre>
       You  are  encouraged to subscribe to the mailing list at &lt;https://groups.google.com/d/forum/perl-critic&gt;.
       At least one member of the development team is usually hanging around in &lt;irc://irc.perl.org/#perlcritic&gt;
       and you can follow Perl::Critic on Twitter, at &lt;https://twitter.com/perlcritic&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       There are a number of distributions of additional Policies available. A few are listed here:

       Perl::Critic::More

       Perl::Critic::Bangs

       Perl::Critic::Lax

       Perl::Critic::StricterSubs

       Perl::Critic::Swift

       Perl::Critic::Tics

       These distributions enable you to use Perl::Critic in your unit tests:

       Test::Perl::Critic

       Test::Perl::Critic::Progressive

       There is also a distribution that will  install  all  the  Perl::Critic  related  modules  known  to  the
       development team:

       Task::Perl::Critic

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Scrutinizing Perl code is hard for humans, let alone machines.  If you find any bugs, particularly false-
       positives    or    false-negatives    from    a    Perl::Critic::Policy,    please    submit    them   at
       &lt;https://github.com/Perl-Critic/Perl-Critic/issues&gt;.  Thanks.
