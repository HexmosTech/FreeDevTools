</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gawk - pattern scanning and processing language

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gawk</b> [ POSIX or GNU style options ] <b>-f</b> <u>program-file</u> [ <b>--</b> ] file ...
       <b>gawk</b> [ POSIX or GNU style options ] [ <b>--</b> ] <u>program-text</u> file ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Gawk</u>  is the GNU Project's implementation of the AWK programming language.  It conforms to the definition
       of the language in the POSIX 1003.1 standard.  This version in turn is based on the  description  in  <u>The</u>
       <u>AWK</u> <u>Programming</u> <u>Language</u>, by Aho, Kernighan, and Weinberger.  <u>Gawk</u> provides the additional features found
       in the current version of Brian Kernighan's <u>awk</u> and numerous GNU-specific extensions.

       The  command line consists of options to <u>gawk</u> itself, the AWK program text (if not supplied via the <b>-f</b> or
       <b>--include</b> options), and values to be made available in the <b>ARGC</b> and <b>ARGV</b> pre-defined AWK variables.

</pre><h4><b>PREFACE</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page is intentionally as terse as possible.  Full details are provided in <u>GAWK:</u> <u>Effective</u> <u>AWK</u>
       <u>Programming</u>, and you should look there for the full story on any specific feature.  Where possible, links
       to the online version of the manual are provided.

</pre><h4><b>OPTION</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Gawk</u> options may be either traditional POSIX-style one letter options, or GNU-style long options.   POSIX
       options  start with a single “-”, while long options start with “--”.  Long options are provided for both
       GNU-specific features and for POSIX-mandated features.

       <u>Gawk</u>-specific options are typically used in long-option form.   Arguments  to  long  options  are  either
       joined  with  the  option  by  an <b>=</b> sign, with no intervening spaces, or they may be provided in the next
       command line argument.  Long options may be abbreviated, as long as the abbreviation remains unique.

       Additionally, every long option has a corresponding short option, so that the option's functionality  may
       be used from within <b>#!</b>  executable scripts.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Gawk</u>  accepts  the  following  options.   Standard options are listed first, followed by options for <u>gawk</u>
       extensions, listed alphabetically by short option.

       <b>-f</b> <u>program-file</u>, <b>--file</b> <u>program-file</u>
              Read the AWK program source from the file <u>program-file</u>, instead of from  the  first  command  line
              argument.   Multiple <b>-f</b> options may be used.  Files read with <b>-f</b> are treated as if they begin with
              an implicit <b>@namespace</b> <b>"awk"</b> statement.

       <b>-F</b> <u>fs</u>, <b>--field-separator</b> <u>fs</u>
              Use <u>fs</u> for the input field separator (the value of the <b>FS</b> predefined variable).

       <b>-v</b> <u>var</u><b>=</b><u>val</u>, <b>--assign</b> <u>var</u><b>=</b><u>val</u>
              Assign the value <u>val</u> to the variable <u>var</u>, before execution of the program begins.   Such  variable
              values are available to the <b>BEGIN</b> rule of an AWK program.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--characters-as-bytes</b>
              Treat all input data as single-byte characters.  The <b>--posix</b> option overrides this one.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--traditional</b>
              Run  in  <u>compatibility</u> mode.  In compatibility mode, <u>gawk</u> behaves identically to Brian Kernighan's
              <u>awk</u>; none of the GNU-specific extensions are recognized.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--copyright</b>
              Print the short version of the GNU copyright information message on the standard output  and  exit
              successfully.

       <b>-d</b>[<u>file</u>], <b>--dump-variables</b>[<b>=</b><u>file</u>]
              Print  a  sorted list of global variables, their types and final values to <u>file</u>.  The default file
              is <b>awkvars.out</b> in the current directory.

       <b>-D</b>[<u>file</u>], <b>--debug</b>[<b>=</b><u>file</u>]
              Enable debugging of AWK programs.  By default, the debugger reads commands interactively from  the
              keyboard  (standard  input).   The optional <u>file</u> argument specifies a file with a list of commands
              for the debugger to execute non-interactively.
              In this mode of execution, <u>gawk</u> loads the AWK source code and then prompts for debugging commands.
              <u>Gawk</u> can only debug AWK program source provided with the <b>-f</b> and <b>--include</b> options.   The  debugger
              is        documented        in        <u>GAWK:</u>       <u>Effective</u>       <u>AWK</u>       <u>Programming</u>;       see
              <u>https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Debugger.html#Debugger</u>.

       <b>-e</b> <u>program-text</u>, <b>--source</b> <u>program-text</u>
              Use <u>program-text</u> as AWK program source code.  Each argument supplied via <b>-e</b> is treated  as  if  it
              begins with an implicit <b>@namespace</b> <b>"awk"</b> statement.

       <b>-E</b> <u>file</u>, <b>--exec</b> <u>file</u>
              Similar  to  <b>-f</b>,  however,  this is option is the last one processed.  This should be used with <b>#!</b>
              scripts, particularly for CGI applications, to avoid passing in options or source code (!) on  the
              command line from a URL.  This option disables command-line variable assignments.

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--gen-pot</b>
              Scan  and parse the AWK program, and generate a GNU <b>.pot</b> (Portable Object Template) format file on
              standard output with entries for all localizable strings in the program.  The  program  itself  is
              not executed.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print  a  relatively  short  summary of the available options on the standard output.  Per the <u>GNU</u>
              <u>Coding</u> <u>Standards</u>, these options cause an immediate, successful exit.

       <b>-i</b> <u>include-file</u>, <b>--include</b> <u>include-file</u>
              Load an awk source library.  This searches for the library using the <b>AWKPATH</b> environment variable.
              If the initial search fails, another attempt will be made after appending the  <b>.awk</b>  suffix.   The
              file  will be loaded only once (i.e., duplicates are eliminated), and the code does not constitute
              the main program source.  Files read with <b>--include</b> are treated as if they begin with an  implicit
              <b>@namespace</b> <b>"awk"</b> statement.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--trace</b>
              Print  the  internal  byte  code names as they are executed when running the program. The trace is
              printed to standard error. Each ``op code'' is preceded by a <b>+</b> sign in the output.

       <b>-l</b> <u>lib</u>, <b>--load</b> <u>lib</u>
              Load a <u>gawk</u> extension from the shared library <u>lib</u>.   This  searches  for  the  library  using  the
              <b>AWKLIBPATH</b>  environment variable.  If the initial search fails, another attempt will be made after
              appending the default shared library suffix for the platform.  The library initialization  routine
              is expected to be named <b>dl_load()</b>.

       <b>-L</b> [<u>value</u>], <b>--lint</b>[<b>=</b><u>value</u>]
              Provide  warnings  about constructs that are dubious or non-portable to other AWK implementations.
              See  <u>https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Options.html#Options</u>  for  the   list   of
              possible values for <u>value</u>.

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--bignum</b>
              Force arbitrary precision arithmetic on numbers. This option has no effect if <u>gawk</u> is not compiled
              to use the GNU MPFR and GMP libraries.  (In such a case, <u>gawk</u> issues a warning.)

              <b>NOTE:</b> This feature is <u>on</u> <u>parole</u>.  The primary <u>gawk</u> maintainer is no longer supporting it, although
              there  is  a member of the development team who is. If this situation changes, the feature will be
              removed from <u>gawk</u>.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--non-decimal-data</b>
              Recognize octal and hexadecimal values in input data.  <u>Use</u> <u>this</u> <u>option</u> <u>with</u> <u>great</u> <u>caution!</u>

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--use-lc-numeric</b>
              Force <u>gawk</u> to use the locale's decimal point character when parsing input data.

       <b>-o</b>[<u>file</u>], <b>--pretty-print</b>[<b>=</b><u>file</u>]
              Output a pretty printed version of the program to <u>file</u>.  The default file is  <b>awkprof.out</b>  in  the
              current directory.  This option implies <b>--no-optimize</b>.

       <b>-O</b>, <b>--optimize</b>
              Enable  <u>gawk</u>'s default optimizations upon the internal representation of the program.  This option
              is on by default.

       <b>-p</b>[<u>prof-file</u>], <b>--profile</b>[<b>=</b><u>prof-file</u>]
              Start a profiling session, and send the profiling data to <u>prof-file</u>.  The default  is  <b>awkprof.out</b>
              in  the current directory.  The profile contains execution counts of each statement in the program
              in the left margin and function call counts for each user-defined function.  <u>Gawk</u> runs more slowly
              in this mode.  This option implies <b>--no-optimize</b>.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--posix</b>
              This turns on <u>compatibility</u> mode, and disables a number of common extensions.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--re-interval</b>
              Enable the use of <u>interval</u> <u>expressions</u> in regular expression matching.  Interval  expressions  are
              enabled by default, but this option remains for backwards compatibility.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--no-optimize</b>
              Disable <u>gawk</u>'s default optimizations upon the internal representation of the program.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--sandbox</b>
              Run  <u>gawk</u> in sandbox mode, disabling the <b>system()</b> function, input redirection with <b>getline</b>, output
              redirection with <b>print</b> and <b>printf</b>, and loading dynamic  extensions.   Command  execution  (through
              pipelines) is also disabled.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--lint-old</b>
              Provide warnings about constructs that are not portable to the original version of UNIX <u>awk</u>.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Print version information for this particular copy of <u>gawk</u> on the standard output.  This is useful
              when  reporting  bugs.  Per the <u>GNU</u> <u>Coding</u> <u>Standards</u>, these options cause an immediate, successful
              exit.

       <b>--</b>     Signal the end of options. This is useful to allow further arguments to the AWK program itself  to
              start with a “-”.

       In  compatibility  mode,  any other options are flagged as invalid, but are otherwise ignored.  In normal
       operation, as long as program text has been supplied, unknown options are passed on to the AWK program in
       the <b>ARGV</b> array for processing.

       For POSIX compatibility, the <b>-W</b> option may be used, followed by the name of a long option.

</pre><h4><b>AWK</b> <b>PROGRAM</b> <b>EXECUTION</b></h4><pre>
       An AWK program consists of a sequence of optional directives,  pattern-action  statements,  and  optional
       function definitions.

              <b>@include</b> <b>"</b><u>filename</u><b>"</b>
              <b>@load</b> <b>"</b><u>filename</u><b>"</b>
              <b>@namespace</b> <b>"</b><u>name</u><b>"</b>
              <u>pattern</u>   <b>{</b> <u>action</u> <u>statements</u> <b>}</b>
              <b>function</b> <u>name</u><b>(</b><u>parameter</u> <u>list</u><b>)</b> <b>{</b> <u>statements</u> <b>}</b>

       <u>Gawk</u> first reads the program source from the <u>program-file</u>(s) if specified, from arguments to <b>--source</b>, or
       from the first non-option argument on the command line.  The <b>-f</b> and <b>--source</b> options may be used multiple
       times  on  the  command  line.   <u>Gawk</u> reads the program text as if all the <u>program-file</u>s and command line
       source texts had been concatenated together.

       In addition, lines beginning with <b>@include</b> may be used to include other source files into  your  program.
       This is equivalent to using the <b>--include</b> option.

       Lines beginning with <b>@load</b> may be used to load extension functions into your program.  This is equivalent
       to using the <b>--load</b> option.

       The  environment variable <b>AWKPATH</b> specifies a search path to use when finding source files named with the
       <b>-f</b> and <b>--include</b> options.  If this variable does not exist, the default path is <b>".:/usr/local/share/awk"</b>.
       (The actual directory may vary, depending upon how <u>gawk</u> was built and installed.)  If a file  name  given
       to the <b>-f</b> option contains a “/” character, no path search is performed.

       The  environment  variable <b>AWKLIBPATH</b> specifies a search path to use when finding source files named with
       the <b>--load</b> option.  If this variable does not exist, the default  path  is  <b>"/usr/local/lib/gawk"</b>.   (The
       actual directory may vary, depending upon how <u>gawk</u> was built and installed.)

       <u>Gawk</u>  executes AWK programs in the following order.  First, all variable assignments specified via the <b>-v</b>
       option are performed.  Next, <u>gawk</u> compiles the program into an internal form.  Then,  <u>gawk</u>  executes  the
       code  in  the  <b>BEGIN</b> rule(s) (if any), and then proceeds to read each file named in the <b>ARGV</b> array (up to
       <b>ARGV[ARGC-1]</b>).  If there are no files named on the command line, <u>gawk</u> reads the standard input.

       If a filename on the command line has the form <u>var</u><b>=</b><u>val</u> it is  treated  as  a  variable  assignment.   The
       variable <u>var</u> will be assigned the value <u>val</u>.  (This happens after any <b>BEGIN</b> rule(s) have been run.)

       If the value of a particular element of <b>ARGV</b> is empty (<b>""</b>), <u>gawk</u> skips over it.

       For  each input file, if a <b>BEGINFILE</b> rule exists, <u>gawk</u> executes the associated code before processing the
       contents of the file. Similarly, <u>gawk</u> executes the code associated with <b>ENDFILE</b>  rules  after  processing
       the file.

       For  each  record in the input, <u>gawk</u> tests to see if it matches any <u>pattern</u> in the AWK program.  For each
       pattern that the record matches, <u>gawk</u> executes the associated <u>action</u>.  The patterns  are  tested  in  the
       order they occur in the program.

       Finally, after all the input is exhausted, <u>gawk</u> executes the code in the <b>END</b> rule(s) (if any).

   <b>Command</b> <b>Line</b> <b>Directories</b>
       According  to  POSIX,  files  named  on  the  <u>awk</u>  command  line  must  be  text  files.  The behavior is
       ``undefined'' if they are not.  Most versions of <u>awk</u> treat a directory on the command  line  as  a  fatal
       error.

       For <u>gawk</u>, a directory on the command line produces a warning, but is otherwise skipped.  If either of the
       <b>--posix</b>  or <b>--traditional</b> options is given, then <u>gawk</u> reverts to treating directories on the command line
       as a fatal error.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES,</b> <b>RECORDS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>FIELDS</b></h4><pre>
       AWK variables are dynamic; they come into existence when they are first used.  Their  values  are  either
       floating-point  numbers or strings, or both, depending upon how they are used.  Additionally, <u>gawk</u> allows
       variables to have regular-expression type.  AWK also has one dimensional  arrays;  arrays  with  multiple
       dimensions  may  be  simulated.   However,  <u>gawk</u>  provides  true  arrays  of arrays.  Several pre-defined
       variables are set as a program runs; these are described as needed and summarized below.

   <b>Records</b>
       Normally, records are separated by newline characters.  You can control  how  records  are  separated  by
       assigning         values         to         the         built-in         variable         <b>RS</b>.         See
       <u>https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Records.html</u> for the details.

   <b>Fields</b>
       As each input record is read, <u>gawk</u> splits the record into <u>fields</u>, using the value of the <b>FS</b>  variable  as
       the  field  separator.   Additionally, <b>FIELDWIDTHS</b> and <b>FPAT</b> may be used to control input field splitting.
       See the details, starting at <u>https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Fields.html</u>.

       Each field in the input record may be referenced by its position: <b>$1</b>, <b>$2</b>, and so on.   <b>$0</b>  is  the  whole
       record, including leading and trailing whitespace.

       The variable <b>NF</b> is set to the total number of fields in the input record.

       References  to  non-existent fields (i.e., fields after <b>$NF</b>) produce the null string.  However, assigning
       to a non-existent field (e.g., <b>$(NF+2)</b> <b>=</b> <b>5</b>) increases the value of <b>NF</b>,  creates  any  intervening  fields
       with  the null string as their values, and causes the value of <b>$0</b> to be recomputed, with the fields being
       separated by the value of <b>OFS</b>.  References to negative numbered fields cause a fatal error.  Decrementing
       <b>NF</b> causes the values of fields past the new value to be lost, and the value of <b>$0</b> to be recomputed,  with
       the fields being separated by the value of <b>OFS</b>.

       Assigning  a  value  to  an  existing  field causes the whole record to be rebuilt when <b>$0</b> is referenced.
       Similarly, assigning a value to <b>$0</b> causes the record to be resplit, creating new values for the fields.

   <b>Built-in</b> <b>Variables</b>
       <u>Gawk</u>'s  built-in  variables  are  listed  below.   This  list  is  purposely  terse.  For  details,   see
       <u>https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Built_002din-Variables</u>.

       <b>ARGC</b>        The number of command line arguments.

       <b>ARGIND</b>      The index in <b>ARGV</b> of the current file being processed.

       <b>ARGV</b>        Array of command line arguments.  The array is indexed from 0 to <b>ARGC</b> - 1.

       <b>BINMODE</b>     On   non-POSIX   systems,   specifies   use   of   “binary”  mode  for  all  file  I/O.   See
                   <u>https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/PC-Using.html</u> for the details.

       <b>CONVFMT</b>     The conversion format for numbers, <b>"%.6g"</b>, by default.

       <b>ENVIRON</b>     An array containing the values of the current environment.   The  array  is  indexed  by  the
                   environment variables, each element being the value of that variable.

       <b>ERRNO</b>       If  a  system error occurs either doing a redirection for <b>getline</b>, during a read for <b>getline</b>,
                   or during a <b>close()</b>, then <b>ERRNO</b> is set to a  string  describing  the  error.   The  value  is
                   subject to translation in non-English locales.

       <b>FIELDWIDTHS</b> A  whitespace-separated list of field widths.  When set, <u>gawk</u> parses the input into fields of
                   fixed width, instead of using the value of the <b>FS</b> variable  as  the  field  separator.   Each
                   field  width  may  optionally be preceded by a colon-separated value specifying the number of
                   characters to skip before the field starts.

       <b>FILENAME</b>    The name of the current input file.  If no files are specified on the command line, the value
                   of <b>FILENAME</b> is “-”.  However, <b>FILENAME</b> is undefined inside the  <b>BEGIN</b>  rule  (unless  set  by
                   <b>getline</b>).

       <b>FNR</b>         The input record number in the current input file.

       <b>FPAT</b>        A  regular  expression  describing  the  contents  of the fields in a record.  When set, <u>gawk</u>
                   parses the input into fields, where the fields match the regular expression, instead of using
                   the value of <b>FS</b> as the field separator.

       <b>FS</b>          The      input      field      separator,      a      space      by       default.        See
                   <u>https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Field-Separators.html</u> for the details.

       <b>FUNCTAB</b>     An  array  whose  indices  and  corresponding values are the names of all the user-defined or
                   extension functions in the program.  <b>NOTE</b>: You may not use  the  <b>delete</b>  statement  with  the
                   <b>FUNCTAB</b> array.

       <b>SUBSEP</b>      The string used to separate multiple subscripts in array elements, by default <b>"\034"</b>.

       <b>SYMTAB</b>      An array whose indices are the names of all currently defined global variables and arrays  in
                   the  program.   You  may  not  use  the <b>delete</b> statement with the <b>SYMTAB</b> array, nor assign to
                   elements with an index that is not a variable name.

       <b>TEXTDOMAIN</b>  The text domain of the AWK program; used to find the localized translations for the program's
                   strings.

   <b>Arrays</b>
       Arrays are subscripted with an expression between square brackets (<b>[</b> and <b>]</b>).  If  the  expression  is  an
       expression list (<u>expr</u>, <u>expr</u> ...)  then the array subscript is a string consisting of the concatenation of
       the  (string)  value of each expression, separated by the value of the <b>SUBSEP</b> variable.  This facility is
       used to simulate multiply dimensioned arrays.  For example:

              <b>i</b> <b>=</b> <b>"A";</b> <b>j</b> <b>=</b> <b>"B";</b> <b>k</b> <b>=</b> <b>"C"</b>
              <b>x[i,</b> <b>j,</b> <b>k]</b> <b>=</b> <b>"hello,</b> <b>world\n"</b>

       assigns the string <b>"hello,</b> <b>world\n"</b> to the element of  the  array  <b>x</b>  which  is  indexed  by  the  string
       <b>"A\034B\034C"</b>.  All arrays in AWK are associative, i.e., indexed by string values.

       The special operator <b>in</b> may be used to test if an array has an index consisting of a particular value:

              <b>if</b> <b>(val</b> <b>in</b> <b>array)</b>
                   <b>print</b> <b>array[val]</b>

       If the array has multiple subscripts, use <b>(i,</b> <b>j)</b> <b>in</b> <b>array</b>.

       The  <b>in</b>  construct may also be used in a <b>for</b> loop to iterate over all the elements of an array.  However,
       the <b>(i,</b> <b>j)</b> <b>in</b> <b>array</b> construct only works in tests, not in <b>for</b> loops.

       An element may be deleted from an array using the <b>delete</b> statement.  The <b>delete</b>  statement  may  also  be
       used to delete the entire contents of an array, just by specifying the array name without a subscript.

       <u>gawk</u> supports true multidimensional arrays. It does not require that such arrays be ``rectangular'' as in
       C or C++.  See <u>https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Arrays</u> for details.

   <b>Namespaces</b>
       <u>Gawk</u>  provides  a  simple  <u>namespace</u>  facility to help work around the fact that all variables in AWK are
       global.

       A <u>qualified</u> <u>name</u> consists of a two simple identifiers joined by  a  double  colon  (<b>::</b>).   The  left-hand
       identifier  represents the namespace and the right-hand identifier is the variable within it.  All simple
       (non-qualified) names are considered to be in the ``current'' namespace; the default  namespace  is  <b>awk</b>.
       However,  simple  identifiers  consisting  solely of uppercase letters are forced into the <b>awk</b> namespace,
       even if the current namespace is different.

       You change the current namespace with an <b>@namespace</b> <b>"</b><u>name</u><b>"</b> directive.

       The standard predefined builtin function names may  not  be  used  as  namespace  names.   The  names  of
       additional  functions  provided  by <u>gawk</u> may be used as namespace names or as simple identifiers in other
       namespaces.                   For                   more                   details,                   see
       <u>https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Namespaces.html#Namespaces</u>.

   <b>Variable</b> <b>Typing</b> <b>And</b> <b>Conversion</b>
       Variables  and  fields  may  be  (floating point) numbers, or strings, or both.  They may also be regular
       expressions. How the value of a variable is interpreted depends upon its context.  If used in  a  numeric
       expression, it will be treated as a number; if used as a string it will be treated as a string.

       To  force  a  variable  to be treated as a number, add zero to it; to force it to be treated as a string,
       concatenate it with the null string.

       Uninitialized variables have the numeric value zero and the string value "" (the null, or empty, string).

       When a string must be converted to a number, the conversion is accomplished using <u><a href="../man3/strtod.3.html">strtod</a></u>(3).  A number is
       converted to a string by using the value of <b>CONVFMT</b> as a format string for <u><a href="../man3/sprintf.3.html">sprintf</a></u>(3), with  the  numeric
       value  of  the  variable  as  the  argument.  However, even though all numbers in AWK are floating-point,
       integral values are <u>always</u> converted as integers.

       <u>Gawk</u> performs comparisons as follows: If two variables are numeric, they are  compared  numerically.   If
       one  value  is  numeric and the other has a string value that is a “numeric string,” then comparisons are
       also done numerically.  Otherwise, the numeric value is converted to a string and a string comparison  is
       performed.  Two strings are compared, of course, as strings.

       Note  that  string constants, such as <b>"57"</b>, are <u>not</u> numeric strings, they are string constants.  The idea
       of “numeric string” only applies to fields, <b>getline</b> input, <b>FILENAME</b>, <b>ARGV</b> elements, <b>ENVIRON</b> elements  and
       the  elements  of  an array created by <b>split()</b> or <b>patsplit()</b> that are numeric strings.  The basic idea is
       that <u>user</u> <u>input</u>, and only user input, that looks numeric, should be treated that way.

   <b>Octal</b> <b>and</b> <b>Hexadecimal</b> <b>Constants</b>
       You may use C-style octal and hexadecimal constants in your AWK program source code.   For  example,  the
       octal value <b>011</b> is equal to decimal <b>9</b>, and the hexadecimal value <b>0x11</b> is equal to decimal 17.

   <b>String</b> <b>Constants</b>
       String  constants  in  AWK  are  sequences  of  characters enclosed between double quotes (like <b>"value"</b>).
       Within    strings,    certain    <u>escape</u>    <u>sequences</u>    are     recognized,     as     in     C.      See
       <u>https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Escape-Sequences</u> for the details.

   <b>Regexp</b> <b>Constants</b>
       A  regular  expression  constant  is  a  sequence  of  characters  enclosed between forward slashes (like
       <b>/value/</b>).

       The escape sequences described in the manual may also be used inside constant regular expressions  (e.g.,
       <b>/[</b> <b>\t\f\n\r\v]/</b> matches whitespace characters).

       <u>Gawk</u>  provides  <u>strongly</u>  <u>typed</u>  regular  expression constants. These are written with a leading <b>@</b> symbol
       (like so: <b>@/value/</b>).  Such constants may be assigned to scalars (variables, array elements) and passed to
       user-defined functions. Variables that have been so assigned have regular expression type.

</pre><h4><b>PATTERNS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ACTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       AWK is a line-oriented language.  The pattern comes first, and then the action.   Action  statements  are
       enclosed  in  <b>{</b>  and <b>}</b>.  Either the pattern may be missing, or the action may be missing, but, of course,
       not both.  If the pattern is missing, the action executes for every single record of  input.   A  missing
       action is equivalent to

              <b>{</b> <b>print</b> <b>}</b>

       which prints the entire record.

       Comments  begin with the <b>#</b> character, and continue until the end of the line.  Empty lines may be used to
       separate statements.  Normally, a statement ends with a newline, however, this is not the case for  lines
       ending  in  a  comma,  <b>{</b>,  <b>?</b>,  <b>:</b>,  <b>&amp;&amp;</b>,  or  <b>||</b>.   Lines  ending  in <b>do</b> or <b>else</b> also have their statements
       automatically continued on the following line.  In other cases, a line can be continued by ending it with
       a “\”, in which case the newline is ignored.  However, a “\” after a <b>#</b> is not special.

       Multiple statements may be put on one line by separating them with a  “;”.   This  applies  to  both  the
       statements  within  the  action part of a pattern-action pair (the usual case), and to the pattern-action
       statements themselves.

   <b>Patterns</b>
       AWK patterns may be one of the following:

              <b>BEGIN</b>
              <b>END</b>
              <b>BEGINFILE</b>
              <b>ENDFILE</b>
              <b>/</b><u>regular</u> <u>expression</u><b>/</b>
              <u>relational</u> <u>expression</u>
              <u>pattern</u> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <u>pattern</u>
              <u>pattern</u> <b>||</b> <u>pattern</u>
              <u>pattern</u> <b>?</b> <u>pattern</u> <b>:</b> <u>pattern</u>
              <b>(</b><u>pattern</u><b>)</b>
              <b>!</b> <u>pattern</u>
              <u>pattern1</u><b>,</b> <u>pattern2</u>

       <b>BEGIN</b> and <b>END</b> are two special kinds of patterns which are not tested against the input.  The action parts
       of all <b>BEGIN</b> patterns are merged as if all the statements had been written in a single <b>BEGIN</b> rule.   They
       are executed before any of the input is read.  Similarly, all the <b>END</b> rules are merged, and executed when
       all  the  input  is  exhausted (or when an <b>exit</b> statement is executed).  <b>BEGIN</b> and <b>END</b> patterns cannot be
       combined with other patterns in pattern expressions.  <b>BEGIN</b> and <b>END</b> patterns cannot have  missing  action
       parts.

       <b>BEGINFILE</b> and <b>ENDFILE</b> are additional special patterns whose actions are executed before reading the first
       record  of  each  command-line  input  file  and  after reading the last record of each file.  Inside the
       <b>BEGINFILE</b> rule, the value of <b>ERRNO</b> is the empty string if the file was opened  successfully.   Otherwise,
       there  is  some  problem  with the file and the code should use <b>nextfile</b> to skip it. If that is not done,
       <u>gawk</u> produces its usual fatal error for files that cannot be opened.

       For <b>/</b><u>regular</u> <u>expression</u><b>/</b> patterns, the associated statement  is  executed  for  each  input  record  that
       matches  the regular expression.  Regular expressions are essentially the same as those in <u><a href="../man1/egrep.1.html">egrep</a></u>(1).  See
       <u>https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Regexp.html</u> for the details on regular expressions.

       A <u>relational</u> <u>expression</u> may use any of the operators defined below in  the  section  on  actions.   These
       generally test whether certain fields match certain regular expressions.

       The  <b>&amp;&amp;</b>,  <b>||</b>, and <b>!</b>  operators are logical AND, logical OR, and logical NOT, respectively, as in C.  They
       do short-circuit evaluation, also as in C, and are used for combining more primitive pattern expressions.
       As in most languages, parentheses may be used to change the order of evaluation.

       The <b>?:</b> operator is like the same operator in C.  If the first pattern is true then the pattern  used  for
       testing  is  the second pattern, otherwise it is the third.  Only one of the second and third patterns is
       evaluated.

       The <u>pattern1</u><b>,</b> <u>pattern2</u> form of an expression is called a <u>range</u> <u>pattern</u>.  It  matches  all  input  records
       starting  with  a  record  that  matches  <u>pattern1</u>,  and continuing until a record that matches <u>pattern2</u>,
       inclusive.  It does not combine with any other sort of pattern expression.

   <b>Actions</b>
       Action statements are enclosed in braces, <b>{</b> and <b>}</b>.  Action statements consist of  the  usual  assignment,
       conditional,  and  looping  statements  found  in most languages.  The operators, control statements, and
       input/output statements available are patterned after those in C.

   <b>Operators</b>
       The operators in AWK, in order of decreasing precedence, are:

       <b>(</b>...<b>)</b>       Grouping

       <b>$</b>           Field reference.

       <b>++</b> <b>--</b>       Increment and decrement, both prefix and postfix.

       <b>^</b>           Exponentiation.

       <b>+</b> <b>-</b> <b>!</b>       Unary plus, unary minus, and logical negation.

       <b>*</b> <b>/</b> <b>%</b>       Multiplication, division, and modulus.

       <b>+</b> <b>-</b>         Addition and subtraction.

       <u>space</u>       String concatenation.

       <b>|</b>   <b>|&amp;</b>      Piped I/O for <b>getline</b>, <b>print</b>, and <b>printf</b>.

       <b>&lt;</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>&lt;=</b> <b>&gt;=</b> <b>==</b> <b>!=</b>
                   The regular relational operators.

       <b>~</b> <b>!~</b>        Regular expression match, negated match.

       <b>in</b>          Array membership.

       <b>&amp;&amp;</b>          Logical AND.

       <b>||</b>          Logical OR.

       <b>?:</b>          The C conditional expression.  This has the form <u>expr1</u> <b>?</b> <u>expr2</u> <b>:</b> <u>expr3</u>.  If  <u>expr1</u>  is  true,
                   the  value of the expression is <u>expr2</u>, otherwise it is <u>expr3</u>.  Only one of <u>expr2</u> and <u>expr3</u> is
                   evaluated.

       <b>=</b> <b>+=</b> <b>-=</b> <b>*=</b> <b>/=</b> <b>%=</b> <b>^=</b>
                   Assignment.  Both absolute assignment <b>(</b><u>var</u> <b>=</b> <u>value</u><b>)</b> and operator-assignment (the other forms)
                   are supported.

   <b>Control</b> <b>Statements</b>
       The control statements are as follows:

              <b>if</b> <b>(</b><u>condition</u><b>)</b> <u>statement</u> [ <b>else</b> <u>statement</u> ]
              <b>while</b> <b>(</b><u>condition</u><b>)</b> <u>statement</u>
              <b>do</b> <u>statement</u> <b>while</b> <b>(</b><u>condition</u><b>)</b>
              <b>for</b> <b>(</b><u>expr1</u><b>;</b> <u>expr2</u><b>;</b> <u>expr3</u><b>)</b> <u>statement</u>
              <b>for</b> <b>(</b><u>var</u> <b>in</b> <u>array</u><b>)</b> <u>statement</u>
              <b>break</b>
              <b>continue</b>
              <b>delete</b> <u>array</u><b>[</b><u>index</u><b>]</b>
              <b>delete</b> <u>array</u>
              <b>exit</b> [ <u>expression</u> ]
              <b>{</b> <u>statements</u> <b>}</b>
              <b>switch</b> <b>(</b><u>expression</u><b>)</b> <b>{</b>
              <b>case</b> <u>value</u><b>|</b><u>regex</u> <b>:</b> <u>statement</u>
              <u>...</u>
              [ <b>default:</b> <u>statement</u> ]
              <b>}</b>

   <b>I/O</b> <b>Statements</b>
       The input/output statements are as follows:

       <b>close(</b><u>file</u> [<b>,</b> <u>how</u>]<b>)</b>   Close an open file, pipe or coprocess.  The optional <u>how</u> should only be  used  when
                             closing  one  end  of  a  two-way  pipe to a coprocess.  It must be a string value,
                             either <b>"to"</b> or <b>"from"</b>.

       <b>getline</b>               Set <b>$0</b> from the next input record; set <b>NF</b>, <b>NR</b>, <b>FNR</b>, <b>RT</b>.

       <b>getline</b> <b>&lt;</b><u>file</u>         Set <b>$0</b> from the next record of <u>file</u>; set <b>NF</b>, <b>RT</b>.

       <b>getline</b> <u>var</u>           Set <u>var</u> from the next input record; set <b>NR</b>, <b>FNR</b>, <b>RT</b>.

       <b>getline</b> <u>var</u> <b>&lt;</b><u>file</u>     Set <u>var</u> from the next record of <u>file</u>; set <b>RT</b>.

       <u>command</u> <b>|</b> <b>getline</b> [<u>var</u>]
                             Run <u>command</u>, piping the output either into <b>$0</b> or <u>var</u>, as above, and <b>RT</b>.

       <u>command</u> <b>|&amp;</b> <b>getline</b> [<u>var</u>]
                             Run <u>command</u> as a coprocess piping the output either into <b>$0</b> or <u>var</u>, as  above,  and
                             <b>RT</b>.   (The  <u>command</u>  can  also be a socket.  See the subsection <b>Special</b> <b>File</b> <b>Names</b>,
                             below.)

       <b>fflush(</b>[<u>file</u>]<b>)</b>        Flush any buffers associated with the open output file or pipe <u>file</u>.   If  <u>file</u>  is
                             missing or if it is the null string, then flush all open output files and pipes.

       <b>next</b>                  Stop  processing  the  current  input record.  Read the next input record and start
                             processing over with the first pattern in the AWK program.  Upon reaching  the  end
                             of the input data, execute any <b>END</b> rule(s).

       <b>nextfile</b>              Stop  processing the current input file.  The next input record read comes from the
                             next input file.  Update <b>FILENAME</b> and <b>ARGIND</b>, reset <b>FNR</b> to 1, and start  processing
                             over with the first pattern in the AWK program.  Upon reaching the end of the input

       The <b>getline</b> command returns 1 on success, zero on end of file, and -1 on an error.  If the <u><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></u>(3) value
       indicates  that  the  I/O  operation  may  be  retried, and <b>PROCINFO["</b><u>input</u><b>",</b> <b>"RETRY"]</b> is set, then -2 is
       returned instead of -1, and further calls to <b>getline</b> may be attempted.  Upon an error, <b>ERRNO</b> is set to  a
       string describing the problem.

       <b>NOTE</b>:  Failure  in  opening  a  two-way socket results in a non-fatal error being returned to the calling
       function. If using a pipe, coprocess, or socket to <b>getline</b>, or from <b>print</b> or <b>printf</b> within  a  loop,  you
       <u>must</u>  use  <b>close()</b>  to  create  new instances of the command or socket.  AWK does not automatically close
       pipes, sockets, or coprocesses when they return EOF.

       The AWK versions of the <b>printf</b> statement and <b>sprintf()</b> function are similar to those of C.  For  details,
       see <u>https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Printf.html</u>.

   <b>Special</b> <b>File</b> <b>Names</b>
       When  doing  I/O  redirection  from  either <b>print</b> or <b>printf</b> into a file, or via <b>getline</b> from a file, <u>gawk</u>
       recognizes certain special filenames internally.  These filenames allow access to open  file  descriptors
       inherited  from  <u>gawk</u>'s  parent  process  (usually  the shell).  These file names may also be used on the
       command line to name data files.  The filenames are:

       <b>-</b>           The standard input.

       <b><a href="file:/dev/stdin">/dev/stdin</a></b>  The standard input.

       <b>/dev/stdout</b> The standard output.

       <b>/dev/stderr</b> The standard error output.

       <b><a href="file:/dev/fd/">/dev/fd/</a></b><u>n</u>   The file associated with the open file descriptor <u>n</u>.

       The following special filenames may be used with the <b>|&amp;</b> coprocess operator for  creating  TCP/IP  network
       connections:

       <b>/inet/tcp/</b><u>lport</u><b>/</b><u>rhost</u><b>/</b><u>rport</u>
       <b>/inet4/tcp/</b><u>lport</u><b>/</b><u>rhost</u><b>/</b><u>rport</u>
       <b>/inet6/tcp/</b><u>lport</u><b>/</b><u>rhost</u><b>/</b><u>rport</u>
              Files  for a TCP/IP connection on local port <u>lport</u> to remote host <u>rhost</u> on remote port <u>rport</u>.  Use
              a port of <b>0</b> to have the system pick a port.  Use <b>/inet4</b> to force an IPv4 connection, and <b>/inet6</b> to
              force an IPv6 connection.  Plain <b>/inet</b> uses the system default (most likely  IPv4).   Usable  only
              with the <b>|&amp;</b> two-way I/O operator.

       <b>/inet/udp/</b><u>lport</u><b>/</b><u>rhost</u><b>/</b><u>rport</u>
       <b>/inet4/udp/</b><u>lport</u><b>/</b><u>rhost</u><b>/</b><u>rport</u>
       <b>/inet6/udp/</b><u>lport</u><b>/</b><u>rhost</u><b>/</b><u>rport</u>
              Similar, but use UDP/IP instead of TCP/IP.

   <b>Numeric</b> <b>Functions</b>
       AWK has the following built-in arithmetic functions:

       <b>atan2(</b><u>y</u><b>,</b> <u>x</u><b>)</b>   Return the arctangent of <u>y/x</u> in radians.

       <b>cos(</b><u>expr</u><b>)</b>     Return the cosine of <u>expr</u>, which is in radians.

       <b>exp(</b><u>expr</u><b>)</b>     The exponential function.

       <b>int(</b><u>expr</u><b>)</b>     Truncate to integer.

       <b>log(</b><u>expr</u><b>)</b>     The natural logarithm function.

       <b>rand()</b>        Return a random number <u>N</u>, between zero and one, such that 0 ≤ <u>N</u> &lt; 1.

       <b>sin(</b><u>expr</u><b>)</b>     Return the sine of <u>expr</u>, which is in radians.

       <b>sqrt(</b><u>expr</u><b>)</b>    Return the square root of <u>expr</u>.

       <b>srand(</b>[<u>expr</u>]<b>)</b> Use  <u>expr</u> as the new seed for the random number generator.  If no <u>expr</u> is provided, use the
                     time of day.  Return the previous seed for the random number generator.

   <b>String</b> <b>Functions</b>
       <u>Gawk</u>    has    the    following    built-in    string    functions;    details    are     provided     in
       <u>https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/String-Functions</u>.

       <b>asort(</b><u>s</u> [<b>,</b> <u>d</u> [<b>,</b> <u>how</u>] ]<b>)</b> Return  the  number  of  elements  in the source array <u>s</u>.  Sort the contents of <u>s</u>
                               using <u>gawk</u>'s normal rules for comparing values, and replace the  indices  of  the
                               sorted  values  <u>s</u>  with  sequential  integers  starting  with  1. If the optional
                               destination array <u>d</u> is specified, first duplicate <u>s</u> into  <u>d</u>,  and  then  sort  <u>d</u>,
                               leaving  the  indices  of  the  source array <u>s</u> unchanged. The optional string <u>how</u>
                               controls the direction and  the  comparison  mode.   Valid  values  for  <u>how</u>  are
                               described      in      <u>https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/String-</u>
                               <u>Functions.html#String-Functions</u>.  <u>s</u> and <u>d</u> are allowed to be the same array;  this
                               only makes sense when supplying the third argument as well.

       <b>asorti(</b><u>s</u> [<b>,</b> <u>d</u> [<b>,</b> <u>how</u>] ]<b>)</b>
                               Return the number of elements in the source array <u>s</u>.  The behavior is the same as
                               that  of  <b>asort()</b>,  except  that  the array <u>indices</u> are used for sorting, not the
                               array values.  When done, the array is indexed numerically, and  the  values  are
                               those  of  the  original  indices.   The original values are lost; thus provide a
                               second array if you wish to preserve the original.  The purpose of  the  optional
                               string  <u>how</u>  is the same as for <b>asort()</b>.  Here too, <u>s</u> and <u>d</u> are allowed to be the
                               same array; this only makes sense when supplying the third argument as well.

       <b>gensub(</b><u>r</u><b>,</b> <u>s</u><b>,</b> <u>h</u> [<b>,</b> <u>t</u>]<b>)</b>   Search the target string <u>t</u> for matches of the regular expression <u>r</u>.  If  <u>h</u>  is  a
                               string beginning with <b>g</b> or <b>G</b>, then replace all matches of <u>r</u> with <u>s</u>.  Otherwise, <u>h</u>
                               is a number indicating which match of <u>r</u> to replace.  If <u>t</u> is not supplied, use <b>$0</b>
                               instead.  Within the replacement text <u>s</u>, the sequence <b>\</b><u>n</u>, where <u>n</u> is a digit from
                               1 to 9, may be used to indicate just the text that matched the <u>n</u>'th parenthesized
                               subexpression.   The  sequence <b>\0</b> represents the entire matched text, as does the
                               character <b>&amp;</b>.  Unlike <b>sub()</b> and <b>gsub()</b>, the modified string  is  returned  as  the
                               result of the function, and the original target string is <u>not</u> changed.

       <b>gsub(</b><u>r</u><b>,</b> <u>s</u> [<b>,</b> <u>t</u>]<b>)</b>        For  each substring matching the regular expression <u>r</u> in the string <u>t</u>, substitute
                               the string <u>s</u>, and return the number of substitutions.  If <u>t</u> is not supplied,  use
                               <b>$0</b>.   An  <b>&amp;</b>  in  the replacement text is replaced with the text that was actually
                               matched.  Use <b>\&amp;</b> to get  a  literal  <b>&amp;</b>.   (This  must  be  typed  as  <b>"\\&amp;"</b>;  see
                               <u>https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Gory-Details.html#Gory-Details</u>
                               for  a  fuller  discussion  of  the  rules  for ampersands and backslashes in the
                               replacement text of <b>sub()</b>, <b>gsub()</b>, and <b>gensub()</b>.)

       <b>index(</b><u>s</u><b>,</b> <u>t</u><b>)</b>             Return the index of the string <u>t</u> in the string <u>s</u>, or zero if <u>t</u>  is  not  present.
                               (This implies that character indices start at one.)

       <b>length(</b>[<u>s</u>]<b>)</b>             Return  the  length  of  the  string <u>s</u>, or the length of <b>$0</b> if <u>s</u> is not supplied.
                               With an array argument, <b>length()</b> returns the number of elements in the array.

       <b>match(</b><u>s</u><b>,</b> <u>r</u> [<b>,</b> <u>a</u>]<b>)</b>       Return the position in <u>s</u> where the regular expression <u>r</u> occurs, or zero if  <u>r</u>  is
                               not  present,  and  set the values of <b>RSTART</b> and <b>RLENGTH</b>.  Note that the argument
                               order   is   the   same   as   for   the   <b>~</b>   operator:   <u>str</u>   <b>~</b>    <u>re</u>.     See
                               <u>https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/String-Functions.html#String-</u>
                               <u>Functions</u> for a description of how the array <u>a</u> is filled if it is provided.

       <b>patsplit(</b><u>s</u><b>,</b> <u>a</u> [<b>,</b> <u>r</u> [<b>,</b> <u>seps</u>] ]<b>)</b>
                               Split  the string <u>s</u> into the array <u>a</u> and the separators array <u>seps</u> on the regular
                               expression <u>r</u>, and return the number of fields.  Element values are  the  portions
                               of  <u>s</u>  that  matched <u>r</u>.  The value of <b>seps[</b><u>i</u><b>]</b> is the possibly null separator that
                               appeared after  <b>a[</b><u>i</u><b>]</b>.   The  value  of  <b>seps[0]</b>  is  the  possibly  null  leading
                               separator.   If  <u>r</u>  is  omitted, <b>FPAT</b> is used instead.  The arrays <u>a</u> and <u>seps</u> are
                               cleared first.  Splitting behaves identically to field splitting with <b>FPAT</b>.

       <b>split(</b><u>s</u><b>,</b> <u>a</u> [<b>,</b> <u>r</u> [<b>,</b> <u>seps</u>] ]<b>)</b>
                               Split the string <u>s</u> into the array <u>a</u> and the separators array <u>seps</u> on the  regular
                               expression  <u>r</u>,  and  return  the  number  of fields.  If <u>r</u> is omitted, <b>FS</b> is used
                               instead.  The arrays <u>a</u>  and  <u>seps</u>  are  cleared  first.   <b>seps[</b><u>i</u><b>]</b>  is  the  field
                               separator matched by <u>r</u> between <b>a[</b><u>i</u><b>]</b> and <b>a[</b><u>i</u><b>+1]</b>.  Splitting behaves identically to
                               field splitting.

       <b>sprintf(</b><u>fmt</u><b>,</b> <u>expr-list</u><b>)</b> Print <u>expr-list</u> according to <u>fmt</u>, and return the resulting string.

       <b>strtonum(</b><u>str</u><b>)</b>           Examine <u>str</u>, and return its numeric value.  If <u>str</u> begins with a leading <b>0</b>, treat
                               it  as  an  octal  number.   If <u>str</u> begins with a leading <b>0x</b> or <b>0X</b>, treat it as a
                               hexadecimal number.  Otherwise, assume it is a decimal number.

       <b>sub(</b><u>r</u><b>,</b> <u>s</u> [<b>,</b> <u>t</u>]<b>)</b>         Just like <b>gsub()</b>, but replace only the first matching substring.   Return  either
                               zero or one.

       <b>substr(</b><u>s</u><b>,</b> <u>i</u> [<b>,</b> <u>n</u>]<b>)</b>      Return  the  at  most <u>n</u>-character substring of <u>s</u> starting at <u>i</u>.  If <u>n</u> is omitted,
                               use the rest of <u>s</u>.

       <b>tolower(</b><u>str</u><b>)</b>            Return a copy of the string  <u>str</u>,  with  all  the  uppercase  characters  in  <u>str</u>
                               translated   to   their  corresponding  lowercase  counterparts.   Non-alphabetic
                               characters are left unchanged.

       <b>toupper(</b><u>str</u><b>)</b>            Return a copy of the string  <u>str</u>,  with  all  the  lowercase  characters  in  <u>str</u>
                               translated   to   their  corresponding  uppercase  counterparts.   Non-alphabetic
                               characters are left unchanged.

       <u>Gawk</u> is multibyte aware.  This means that <b>index()</b>, <b>length()</b>, <b>substr()</b> and <b>match()</b> all work  in  terms  of
       characters, not bytes.

   <b>Time</b> <b>Functions</b>
       <u>Gawk</u> provides the following functions for obtaining time stamps and formatting them. Details are provided
       in <u>https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Time-Functions</u>.

       <b>mktime(</b><u>datespec</u> [<b>,</b> <u>utc-flag</u>]<b>)</b>
                 Turn  <u>datespec</u>  into  a  time  stamp  of the same form as returned by <b>systime()</b>, and return the
                 result.  If <u>utc-flag</u> is present and is non-zero or non-null, the time is assumed to be  in  the
                 UTC  time  zone; otherwise, the time is assumed to be in the local time zone.  If <u>datespec</u> does
                 not contain enough elements or if the resulting time is out of range, <b>mktime()</b> returns -1.  See
                 <u>https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Time-Functions.html#Time-Functions</u>  for  the
                 details of <u>datespec</u>.

       <b>strftime(</b>[<u>format</u> [<b>,</b> <u>timestamp</u>[<b>,</b> <u>utc-flag</u>]]]<b>)</b>
                 Format  <u>timestamp</u> according to the specification in <u>format</u>.  If <u>utc-flag</u> is present and is non-
                 zero or non-null, the result is in UTC, otherwise the result is in local time.   The  <u>timestamp</u>
                 should be of the same form as returned by <b>systime()</b>.  If <u>timestamp</u> is missing, the current time
                 of  day is used.  If <u>format</u> is missing, a default format equivalent to the output of <u><a href="../man1/date.1.html">date</a></u>(1) is
                 used.  The default format is available in <b>PROCINFO["strftime"]</b>.  See the specification for  the
                 <b>strftime()</b> function in ISO C for the format conversions that are guaranteed to be available.

       <b>systime()</b> Return  the  current  time of day as the number of seconds since the Epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00
                 UTC on POSIX systems).

   <b>Bit</b> <b>Manipulations</b> <b>Functions</b>
       <u>Gawk</u> supplies the following  bit  manipulation  functions.   They  work  by  converting  double-precision
       floating  point values to <b>uintmax_t</b> integers, doing the operation, and then converting the result back to
       floating point.  Passing negative operands to any of these functions causes a fatal error.

       The functions are:

       <b>and(</b><u>v1</u><b>,</b> <u>v2</u> [, ...]<b>)</b> Return the bitwise AND of the values provided in the argument list.  There must be at
                           least two.

       <b>compl(</b><u>val</u><b>)</b>          Return the bitwise complement of <u>val</u>.

       <b>lshift(</b><u>val</u><b>,</b> <u>count</u><b>)</b>  Return the value of <u>val</u>, shifted left by <u>count</u> bits.

       <b>or(</b><u>v1</u><b>,</b> <u>v2</u> [, ...]<b>)</b>  Return the bitwise OR of the values provided in the argument list.  There must be  at
                           least two.

       <b>rshift(</b><u>val</u><b>,</b> <u>count</u><b>)</b>  Return the value of <u>val</u>, shifted right by <u>count</u> bits.

       <b>xor(</b><u>v1</u><b>,</b> <u>v2</u> [, ...]<b>)</b> Return the bitwise XOR of the values provided in the argument list.  There must be at
                           least two.

   <b>Type</b> <b>Functions</b>
       The following functions provide type related information about their arguments.

       <b>isarray(</b><u>x</u><b>)</b> Return true if <u>x</u> is an array, false otherwise.

       <b>typeof(</b><u>x</u><b>)</b>  Return  a  string  indicating  the  type  of  <u>x</u>.  The string will be one of <b>"array"</b>, <b>"number"</b>,
                  <b>"regexp"</b>, <b>"string"</b>, <b>"strnum"</b>, <b>"unassigned"</b>, or <b>"undefined"</b>.

   <b>Internationalization</b> <b>Functions</b>
       The following functions may be used from within your AWK program for  translating  strings  at  run-time.
       For   full   details,   see  <u>https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/I18N-Functions.html#I18N-</u>
       <u>Functions</u>.

       <b>bindtextdomain(</b><u>directory</u> [<b>,</b> <u>domain</u>]<b>)</b>
              Specify the directory where <u>gawk</u> looks for the <b>.gmo</b> files, in case they  will  not  or  cannot  be
              placed in the ``standard'' locations.  It returns the directory where <u>domain</u> is ``bound.''
              The  default  <u>domain</u>  is  the  value  of  <b>TEXTDOMAIN</b>.   If <u>directory</u> is the null string (<b>""</b>), then
              <b>bindtextdomain()</b> returns the current binding for the given <u>domain</u>.

       <b>dcgettext(</b><u>string</u> [<b>,</b> <u>domain</u> [<b>,</b> <u>category</u>]]<b>)</b>
              Return the translation of <u>string</u> in text domain <u>domain</u> for locale category <u>category</u>.  The  default
              value  for  <u>domain</u>  is  the  current  value  of  <b>TEXTDOMAIN</b>.   The  default  value for <u>category</u> is
              <b>"LC_MESSAGES"</b>.

       <b>dcngettext(</b><u>string1</u><b>,</b> <u>string2</u><b>,</b> <u>number</u> [<b>,</b> <u>domain</u> [<b>,</b> <u>category</u>]]<b>)</b>
              Return the plural form used for <u>number</u> of the translation of <u>string1</u> and <u>string2</u>  in  text  domain
              <u>domain</u>  for  locale  category  <u>category</u>.   The  default  value  for <u>domain</u> is the current value of
              <b>TEXTDOMAIN</b>.  The default value for <u>category</u> is <b>"LC_MESSAGES"</b>.

   <b>Boolean</b> <b>Valued</b> <b>Functions</b>
       You can create special Boolean-typed values; see the manual for how they work and why they exist.

       <b>mkbool(</b><u>expression</u><b>)</b>
              Based on the boolean value of <u>expression</u> return either a true value or a false value.  True values
              have numeric value one.  False values have numeric value zero.

</pre><h4><b>USER-DEFINED</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Functions in AWK are defined as follows:

              <b>function</b> <u>name</u><b>(</b><u>parameter</u> <u>list</u><b>)</b> <b>{</b> <u>statements</u> <b>}</b>

       Functions execute when they are called from within expressions in either  patterns  or  actions.   Actual
       parameters  supplied  in  the function call are used to instantiate the formal parameters declared in the
       function.  Arrays are passed by reference, other variables are passed by value.

       Local variables are declared as extra parameters in the parameter list.  The convention  is  to  separate
       local variables from real parameters by extra spaces in the parameter list.  For example:

              <b>function</b>  <b>f(p,</b> <b>q,</b>     <b>a,</b> <b>b)</b>   <b>#</b> <b>a</b> <b>and</b> <b>b</b> <b>are</b> <b>local</b>
              <b>{</b>
                   <b>...</b>
              <b>}</b>

              <b>/abc/</b>     <b>{</b> <b>...</b> <b>;</b> <b>f(1,</b> <b>2)</b> <b>;</b> <b>...</b> <b>}</b>

       The  left parenthesis in a function call is required to immediately follow the function name, without any
       intervening whitespace.  This restriction does not apply to the built-in functions listed above.

       Functions may call each other and may be recursive.  Function parameters  used  as  local  variables  are
       initialized to the null string and the number zero upon function invocation.

       Use  <b>return</b>  <u>expr</u>  to  return  a  value  from  a  function.  The return value is undefined if no value is
       provided, or if the function returns by “falling off” the end.

       Functions may be called indirectly. To do this, assign the name of  the  function  to  be  called,  as  a
       string,  to  a  variable.  Then use the variable as if it were the name of a function, prefixed with an <b>@</b>
       sign, like so:
              <b>function</b> <b>myfunc()</b>
              <b>{</b>
                   <b>print</b> <b>"myfunc</b> <b>called"</b>
                   <b>...</b>
              <b>}</b>

              <b>{</b>    <b>...</b>
                   <b>the_func</b> <b>=</b> <b>"myfunc"</b>
                   <b>@the_func()</b>    <b>#</b> <b>call</b> <b>through</b> <b>the_func</b> <b>to</b> <b>myfunc</b>
                   <b>...</b>
              <b>}</b>

       If <b>--lint</b> has been provided, <u>gawk</u> warns about calls to undefined functions at parse time, instead  of  at
       run time.  Calling an undefined function at run time is a fatal error.

</pre><h4><b>DYNAMICALLY</b> <b>LOADING</b> <b>NEW</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       You  can dynamically add new functions written in C or C++ to the running <u>gawk</u> interpreter with the <b>@load</b>
       statement.    The   full   details   are   beyond    the    scope    of    this    manual    page;    see
       <u>https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Dynamic-Extensions.html#Dynamic-Extensions</u>.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>gawk</u>  profiler  accepts two signals.  <b>SIGUSR1</b> causes it to dump a profile and function call stack to
       the profile file, which is either <b>awkprof.out</b>, or whatever file was named with the <b>--profile</b> option.   It
       then continues to run.  <b>SIGHUP</b> causes <u>gawk</u> to dump the profile and function call stack and then exit.

</pre><h4><b>INTERNATIONALIZATION</b></h4><pre>
       String  constants  are  sequences  of  characters  enclosed  in  double  quotes.  In non-English speaking
       environments, it is possible to mark strings in the AWK program as requiring  translation  to  the  local
       natural  language.  Such  strings  are  marked  in  the AWK program with a leading underscore (“_”).  For
       example,

              <b>gawk</b> <b>'BEGIN</b> <b>{</b> <b>print</b> <b>"hello,</b> <b>world"</b> <b>}'</b>

       always prints <b>hello,</b> <b>world</b>.  But,

              <b>gawk</b> <b>'BEGIN</b> <b>{</b> <b>print</b> <b>_"hello,</b> <b>world"</b> <b>}'</b>

       might           print           <b>bonjour,</b>           <b>monde</b>            in            France.             See
       <u>https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Internationalization.html#Internationalization</u> for the
       steps involved in producing and running a localizable AWK program.

</pre><h4><b>GNU</b> <b>EXTENSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Gawk</u>    has   a   too-large   number   of   extensions   to   POSIX   <u>awk</u>.    They   are   described   in
       <u>https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/POSIX_002fGNU.html</u>.   All  the   extensions   can   be
       disabled by invoking <u>gawk</u> with the <b>--traditional</b> or <b>--posix</b> options.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>AWKPATH</b>  environment  variable  can be used to provide a list of directories that <u>gawk</u> searches when
       looking for files named via the <b>-f</b>, <b>--file</b>, <b>-i</b> and <b>--include</b> options, and the <b>@include</b> directive.  If the
       initial search fails, the path is searched again after appending <b>.awk</b> to the filename.

       The <b>AWKLIBPATH</b> environment variable can be used to provide a list of directories that <u>gawk</u> searches  when
       looking for files named via the <b>-l</b> and <b>--load</b> options.

       The  <b>GAWK_PERSIST_FILE</b> environment variable, if present, specifies a file to use as the backing store for
       persistent memory.  <u>This</u> <u>is</u> <u>an</u> <u>experimental</u>  <u>feature</u>.   See  <u>GAWK:</u>  <u>Effective</u>  <u>AWK</u>  <u>Programming</u>  for  the
       details.

       The  <b>GAWK_READ_TIMEOUT</b>  environment variable can be used to specify a timeout in milliseconds for reading
       input from a terminal, pipe or two-way communication including sockets.

       For connection to a remote host via  socket,  <b>GAWK_SOCK_RETRIES</b>  controls  the  number  of  retries,  and
       <b>GAWK_MSEC_SLEEP</b>  the  interval  between retries.  The interval is in milliseconds. On systems that do not
       support <u><a href="../man3/usleep.3.html">usleep</a></u>(3), the value is rounded up to an integral number of seconds.

       If <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b> exists in the environment, then <u>gawk</u> behaves exactly as if <b>--posix</b> had been  specified
       on the command line.  If <b>--lint</b> has been specified, <u>gawk</u> issues a warning message to this effect.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       If the <b>exit</b> statement is used with a value, then <u>gawk</u> exits with the numeric value given to it.

       Otherwise,  if  there  were  no  problems  during  execution, <u>gawk</u> exits with the value of the C constant
       <b>EXIT_SUCCESS</b>.  This is usually zero.

       If an error occurs, <u>gawk</u> exits with the value of the C constant <b>EXIT_FAILURE</b>.  This is usually one.

       If <u>gawk</u> exits because of a fatal error, the exit status is 2.  On non-POSIX systems, this  value  may  be
       mapped to <b>EXIT_FAILURE</b>.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b> <b>INFORMATION</b></h4><pre>
       This man page documents <u>gawk</u>, version 5.2.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       The  original version of UNIX <u>awk</u> was designed and implemented by Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, and Brian
       Kernighan of Bell Laboratories.  Brian Kernighan continues to maintain and enhance it.

       Paul Rubin and Jay Fenlason, of the Free Software Foundation, wrote  <u>gawk</u>,  to  be  compatible  with  the
       original  version  of  <u>awk</u>  distributed  in Seventh Edition UNIX.  John Woods contributed a number of bug
       fixes.  David Trueman, with contributions from Arnold Robbins, made <u>gawk</u> compatible with the new  version
       of UNIX <u>awk</u>.  Arnold Robbins is the current maintainer.

       See <u>GAWK:</u> <u>Effective</u> <u>AWK</u> <u>Programming</u> for a full list of the contributors to <u>gawk</u> and its documentation.

       See the <b>README</b> file in the <u>gawk</u> distribution for up-to-date information about maintainers and which ports
       are currently supported.

</pre><h4><b>BUG</b> <b>REPORTS</b></h4><pre>
       If you find a bug in <u>gawk</u>, please use the <u><a href="../man1/gawkbug.1.html">gawkbug</a></u>(1) program to report it.

       Full        instructions        for        reporting        a       bug       are       provided       in
       <u>https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Bugs.html</u>.   <u>Please</u>  carefully  read  and  follow  the
       instructions given there.  This will make bug reporting and resolution much easier for everyone involved.
       Really.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>-F</b>  option  is not necessary given the command line variable assignment feature; it remains only for
       backwards compatibility.

       This manual page is too long; <u>gawk</u> has too many features.
