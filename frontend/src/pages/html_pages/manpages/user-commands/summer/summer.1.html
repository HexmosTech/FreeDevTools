       summer - print checksum and system metainformation for files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>summer</b> <b>-ACDbfqtx</b> [<u>startpoint</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>summer</b>  prints  the MD5 checksum of the contents, and the system metainformation (ownership, permissions,
       timestamps, etc.), for a file, or recursively for a whole directory tree.

       Each command line argument should be a file or directory to be processed; if it is a  directory  then  it
       will  be  processed  and  then  its  contents  will also be processed, recursively. If no <u>startpoint</u>s are
       specified on the command line then <b>summer</b> will read a list of newline-separated startpoints from standard
       input.

       Since <b>summer</b> correctly handles devices, FIFOs and other non-regular files it is useful for generating and
       comparing summaries of arbitrary directory trees where md5sum alone would not be.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>summer</b> prints one line of information for each  filesystem  object  it  processes.   Each  line  has  the
       following columns:
           MD5 checksum (in hex) or file type information
           Size of file in bytes
           File access rights (in octal)
           User ID of owner (in decimal)
           Group ID of owner (in decimal)
           atime (time of last access, decimal time_t)
           mtime (time of last modification)
           ctime (time of last status change)
           Filename

       For regular files, the first column is the md5sum. For directories, pipes, symlinks and sockets it is the
       literal  string <b>dir</b>, <b>mountpoint</b>, <b>pipe</b>, <b>symlink</b> or <b>socket</b> as appropriate. For devices it begins with <b>c</b> for
       character or <b>b</b> for block devices, followed by the device number as a single 32 bit hex number and as four
       separate 8 bit decimal numbers (most significant first).

       Note that any bytes in the filename other than printing 7-bit ASCII are escaped using <b>\x</b><u>NN</u> syntax,  where
       <u>NN</u>  are  two  hex  digits;  backslashes are also escaped in this way.  This makes the output unambiguous.
       Filenames will be relative if the relevant <u>startpoint</u> was relative, and absolute if it was absolute.

       For symlinks the filename column is followed by ` <b>-&gt;</b> ' (note the spaces) and  the  target  of  the  link,
       again escaped, as above.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-A</b>     Do not print the atime (time of last access). The atime column will be omitted.

       <b>-C</b>     Do not print the ctime (time of last status change). The ctime column will be omitted.

       <b>-M</b>     Do not print the mtime (time of last modification). The mtime column will be omitted.

       <b>-D</b>     Do not print directory sizes. The size column for directories will read <b>dir</b>.

       <b>-b</b>     Do  not  print  mtime (time of last modification) for symbolic links. The mtime field for symbolic
              links will read <b>link</b>.

       <b>-B</b>     Do not print any times for special files, symlinks, sockets, or fifos.  The atime, mtime and ctime
              fields for these objects will read <b>char</b>, <b>block</b>, <b>link</b>, <b>sock</b> or <b>pipe</b> instead.

       <b>-f</b>     Include information about errors encountered (for example, unreadable files) in  the  output,  and
              continue  processing.  The  default  is  to  print  error  information  to standard error and stop
              immediately an error is encountered.

       <b>-x</b>     Do not cross mountpoints while recursing into subdirectories.  Startpoints which  are  mountpoints
              <u>are</u> descended into.

       <b>-q</b>     Suppress the progress information which <b>summer</b> normally prints to standard error.

       <b>-t</b>     Set  the  field  separator between the information and the filename to a tab character (default is
              space).

       <b>-f</b>     Normally any errors (problems accessing files including nonexistent startpoings, and the like) are
              fatal; an error message is reported to stderr.

              With <b>-f</b> errors are nonfatal and the problems are reported inline.  The filesystem object with  the
              problem  is  reported  in  the  normal  way  except  that  instead  of  the  checksum,  the string
              <b>\[</b><u>problem</u>[<b>:</b> <u>details</u>]<b>]</b> appears.  Fields whose value could not be determined are printed as <b>?</b>.

       <b>-h</b>     Print a brief usage message to stderr (and do nothing else, exiting nonzero).

</pre><h4><b>PARSING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       If the first character in the line is <b>\[</b>, then the first (checksum or type) field is everything until the
       first subsequent <b>]</b>; this may be of variable length and will be followed by one or more spaces.  Otherwise
       the first field has a fixed width: 64 characters, the size of an MD5 checksum represented in hex, and  is
       followed by a single space.

       The  metadata  fields are space-separated but are also space-padded to a minimum width: 10 characters for
       sizes and times and ids; 4 characters for the mode.

       The filename field, and optional link target information, are of variable length, but they are escaped so
       that they do not contain spaces.
