       p0f - identify remote systems passively

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>p0f</b> <u>p0f</u> <u>[</u> <u>-f</u> <u>file</u> <u>]</u> <u>[</u> <u>-i</u> <u>device</u> <u>]</u> <u>[</u> <u>-r</u> <u>file</u> <u>]</u> <u>[</u> <u>-o</u> <u>file</u> <u>]</u> <u>[</u> <u>-s</u> <u>socket</u> <u>]</u> <u>[</u> <u>-u</u> <u>user</u> <u>]</u> <u>[</u> <u>-S</u> <u>limit</u> <u>]</u> <u>[</u> <u>-t</u> <u>c,h</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>p0f</b>  uses a fingerprinting technique based on analyzing the structure of a TCP/IP packet to determine the
       operating system and other configuration properties of a remote host. The process is  completely  passive
       and does not generate any suspicious network traffic. The other host has to either:

       -  connect  to  your  network  - either spontaneously or in an induced manner, for example when trying to
       establish a ftp data stream, returning a bounced mail, performing auth lookup, using  IRC  DCC,  external
       html mail image reference and so on,

       -  or  be contacted by some entity on your network using some standard means (such as a web browsing); it
       can either accept or refuse the connection.

       The method can see thru packet firewalls and does not have the restrictions of an active  fingerprinting.
       The  main uses of passive OS fingerprinting are attacker profiling (IDS and honeypots), visitor profiling
       (content optimization), customer/user profiling (policy enforcement), pen-testing, etc.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-f</b> file
              read fingerprints from file; by default, p0f reads signatures  from  ./p0f.fp  or  /etc/p0f/p0f.fp
              (the  latter  on Unix systems only). You can use this to load custom fingerprint data.  Specifying
              multiple -f values will NOT combine several signature files together.

       <b>-i</b> device
              listen on this device; p0f defaults to whatever device libpcap considers to be the best (and which
              often isn't). On some newer systems you might be able to specify 'any' to listen on  all  devices,
              but  don't  rely  on  this.  Specifying multiple -i values will NOT cause p0f to listen on several
              interfaces at once.

       <b>-r</b> file
              read packets from tcpdump snapshot; this is an alternate mode of operation,  in  which  p0f  reads
              packet  from  pcap  data  capture file, instead of a live network. Useful for forensics (this will
              parse tcpdump -w output, for example).

              You can use Ethereal's text2pcap to convert human-readable packet traces to pcap files, if needed.

       <b>-o</b> file
              write to this logfile. This option is required for -d and implies -t.

       <b>-s</b> socket
              listen on a specified local stream socket (a filesystem object, for example /var/run/p0f-sock) for
              queries. One can later send a packet to this socket with p0f_query structure from p0f-query.h, and
              wait for p0f_response. This is a method of integrating p0f with active services (web server or web
              scripts, etc). P0f will still continue to report signatures the usual way - but you can  use  -qKU
              combination to suppress this. Also see -c notes.

              A sample query tool (p0f-client) is provided in the tools/ subdirectory.

              NOTE: The socket will be created with permissions corresponding to your current umask. If you want
              to restrict access to this interface, use caution.

       <b>-u</b> user
              this  option  forces  p0f to chroot to this user's home directory after reading configuration data
              and binding to sockets, then to switch to his UID, GID and supplementary groups.

              This is a security feature for the paranoid - when running p0f in daemon mode, you might  want  to
              create  a  new  unprivileged user with an empty home directory, and limit the exposure when p0f is
              compromised. That said, should such a compromise occur, the attacker will still have a  socket  he
              can use for sniffing some network traffic (better than rm -rf /).

       <b>-p</b>     switch  card to promiscuous mode; by default, p0f listens only to packets addressed or routed thru
              the machine it runs on. This setting might decrease performance, depending on your network  design
              and load. On switched networks, this usually has little or no effect.

              Note that promiscuous mode on IP-enabled interfaces can be detected remotely, and is sometimes not
              welcome by network administrators.

       <b>-d</b>     go into daemon mode (detach from current terminal and fork into background). Requires -o or -s.

       <b>-L</b>     lists  all  available  interfaces,  then  quits. Particularly useful on Windows, where the system-
              generated interface names are impossible to memorize.

       <b>-S</b> limit
              Limit number of parallel API connections (default: 20)

       <b>-t</b> c,h Set connection / host cache age limits (default: 30s,120m)

       <b>-m</b> c,h Limit the number of active connections / hosts (default: 1000,10000)

</pre><h4><b>FILTERS</b></h4><pre>
       The last part, 'filter rule', is a bpf-style filter expression for incoming packets. It  is  very  useful
       for  excluding or including certain networks, hosts, or specific packets, in the logfile. See man tcpdump
       for more information, few examples:

       ´src port ftp-data´

       ´not dst net 10.0.0.0 mask 255.0.0.0´

       ´dst port 80 and ( src host 195.117.3.59 or src host 217.8.32.51 )´
