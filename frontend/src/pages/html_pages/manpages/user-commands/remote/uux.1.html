</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       uux - Remote command execution over UUCP

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>uux</b> [ options ] command

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>uux</u>  command  is  used to execute a command on a remote system, or to execute a command on the local
       system using files from remote systems.  The command is not executed immediately; the request  is  queued
       until the <u>uucico</u> (8) daemon calls the system and executes it.  The daemon is started automatically unless
       one of the <b>-r</b> or <b>--nouucico</b> options is given.

       The actual command execution is done by the <u>uuxqt</u> (8) daemon.

       File  arguments  can  be  gathered  from  remote  systems to the execution system, as can standard input.
       Standard output may be directed to a file on a remote system.

       The command name may be preceded by a system name followed by  an  exclamation  point  if  it  is  to  be
       executed on a remote system.  An empty system name is taken as the local system.

       Each  argument that contains an exclamation point is treated as naming a file.  The system which the file
       is on is before the exclamation point, and the pathname on that system follows it.  An empty system  name
       is  taken  as  the  local  system;  this must be used to transfer a file to a command being executed on a
       remote system.  If the path is not absolute, it will be appended to the current working directory on  the
       local  system;  the  result may not be meaningful on the remote system.  A pathname may begin with ~/, in
       which  case  it  is  relative  to  the  UUCP   public   directory   (usually   /usr/spool/uucppublic   or
       /var/spool/uucppublic)  on the appropriate system.  A pathname may begin with ~name/, in which case it is
       relative to the home directory of the named user on the appropriate system.

       Standard input and output may be redirected as usual; the pathnames used may contain  exclamation  points
       to indicate that they are on remote systems.  Note that the redirection characters must be quoted so that
       they are passed to <u>uux</u> rather than interpreted by the shell.  Append redirection (&gt;&gt;) does not work.

       All specified files are gathered together into a single directory before execution of the command begins.
       This means that each file must have a distinct base name.  For example,
            uux 'sys1!diff sys2!~user1/foo sys3!~user2/foo &gt;!foo.diff'
       will fail because both files will be copied to sys1 and stored under the name foo.

       Arguments  may  be  quoted  by parentheses to avoid interpretation of exclamation points.  This is useful
       when executing the <u>uucp</u> command on a remote system.

       A request to execute an empty command (e.g., <u>uux</u> <u>sys!)</u>  will create a poll file for the specified system.

       The exit status of <u>uux</u> is one of the codes found in the header file <b>sysexits.h.</b>  In particular, <b>EX_OK</b> ( <b>0</b>
       ) indicates success, and <b>EX_TEMPFAIL</b> ( <b>75</b> ) indicates a temporary failure.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options may be given to <u>uux.</u>

       <b>-,</b> <b>-p,</b> <b>--stdin</b>
            Read standard input and use it as the standard input for the command to be executed.

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--nocopy</b>
            Do not copy local files to the spool directory.  This is the default.  If they  are  removed  before
            being  processed  by  the  <u>uucico</u> (8) daemon, the copy will fail.  The files must be readable by the
            <u>uucico</u> (8) daemon, as well as the by the invoker of <u>uux.</u>

       <b>-C,</b> <b>--copy</b>
            Copy local files to the spool directory.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--link</b>
            Link local files into the spool directory.  If a file can not be linked because it is on a different
            device, it will be copied unless one of the <b>-c</b> or <b>--nocopy</b> options also appears (in other words, use
            of <b>--link</b> switches the default from <b>--nocopy</b> to <b>--copy).</b>  If the  files  are  changed  before  being
            processed  by  the <u>uucico</u> (8) daemon, the changed versions will be used.  The files must be readable
            by the <u>uucico</u> (8) daemon, as well as by the invoker of <u>uux.</u>

       <b>-g</b> <b>grade,</b> <b>--grade</b> <b>grade</b>
            Set the grade of the file transfer command.  Jobs of a higher grade are executed first.  Grades  run
            0 ... 9 A ... Z a ... z from high to low.

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--notification=no</b>
            Do not send mail about the status of the job, even if it fails.

       <b>-z,</b> <b>--notification=error</b>
            Send  mail  about  the  status of the job if an error occurs.  For many <u>uuxqt</u> daemons, including the
            Taylor UUCP <u>uuxqt,</u> this is the default action; for those, <b>--notification=error</b> will have no  effect.
            However,  some  <u>uuxqt</u>  daemons  will  send  mail if the job succeeds unless the <b>--notification=error</b>
            option is used, and some other <u>uuxqt</u> daemons will  not  send  mail  if  the  job  fails  unless  the
            <b>--notification=error</b> option is used.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--nouucico</b>
            Do  not  start  the  <u>uucico</u>  (8) daemon immediately; merely queue up the execution request for later
            processing.

       <b>-j,</b> <b>--jobid</b>
            Print jobids on standard output.  A jobid will be generated for each file copy operation required to
            perform the operation.  These file copies may be cancelled by passing the jobid to the <b>--kill</b> switch
            of <u>uustat</u> (1), which will make the execution impossible to complete.

       <b>-a</b> <b>address,</b> <b>--requestor</b> <b>address</b>
            Report job status to the specified e-mail address.

       <b>-x</b> <b>type,</b> <b>--debug</b> <b>type</b>
            Turn on particular debugging types.  The following types are recognized: abnormal, chat,  handshake,
            uucp-proto,  proto,  port,  config,  spooldir,  execute, incoming, outgoing.  Only abnormal, config,
            spooldir and execute are meaningful for <u>uux.</u>

            Multiple types may be given, separated by commas, and the <b>--debug</b> option may appear multiple  times.
            A number may also be given, which will turn on that many types from the foregoing list; for example,
            <b>--debug</b> <b>2</b> is equivalent to <b>--debug</b> <b>abnormal,chat.</b>

       <b>-I</b> <b>file,</b> <b>--config</b> <b>file</b>
            Set  configuration  file  to  use.   This  option  may  not be available, depending upon how <u>uux</u> was
            compiled.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
            Report version information and exit.

       <b>--help</b>
            Print a help message and exit.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       uux -z - sys1!rmail user1
       Execute the command ``rmail user1'' on the system sys1, giving it as standard input whatever is given  to
       <u>uux</u> as standard input.  If a failure occurs, send a message using <u>mail</u> (1).

       uux 'diff -c sys1!~user1/file1 sys2!~user2/file2 &gt;!file.diff'
       Fetch  the  two  named  files  from  system  sys1  and system sys2 and execute <u>diff</u> putting the result in
       file.diff in the current directory.  The current directory must be writable by the <u>uuxqt</u> (8)  daemon  for
       this to work.

       uux 'sys1!uucp ~user1/file1 (sys2!~user2/file2)'
       Execute  <u>uucp</u>  on  the  system  sys1 copying file1 (on system sys1) to sys2.  This illustrates the use of
       parentheses for quoting.

</pre><h4><b>RESTRICTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The remote system may not permit you to execute certain commands.  Many remote systems  only  permit  the
       execution of <u>rmail</u> and <u>rnews.</u>

       Some of the options are dependent on the capabilities of the <u>uuxqt</u> (8) daemon on the remote system.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Files can not be referenced across multiple systems.

       Too  many  jobids  are  output by <b>--jobid,</b> and there is no good way to cancel a local execution requiring
       remote files.
