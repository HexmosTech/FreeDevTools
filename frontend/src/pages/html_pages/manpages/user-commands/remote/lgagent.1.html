</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       lgagent - ION Load/Go remote agent program

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lgagent</b> <u>own_endpoint_ID</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       ION Load/Go is a system for management of an ION-based network, enabling the execution of ION
       administrative programs at remote nodes.  The system comprises two programs, <b>lgsend</b> and <b>lgagent</b>.

       The <b>lgagent</b> task on a given node opens the indicated ION endpoint for bundle reception, receives the
       extracted payloads of Load/Go bundles sent to it by <b>lgsend</b> as run on one or more remote nodes, and
       processes those payloads, which are the text of Load/Go source files.

       Load/Go source file content is limited to newline-terminated lines of ASCII characters.  More
       specifically, the text of any Load/Go source file is a sequence of <u>line</u> <u>sets</u> of two types: <u>file</u> <u>capsules</u>
       and <u>directives</u>.  Any Load/Go source file may contain any number of file capsules and any number of
       directives, freely intermingled in any order, but the typical structure of a Load/Go source file is
       simply a single file capsule followed by a single directive.

       When <b>lgagent</b> identifies a file capsule, it copies all of the capsule's text lines to a new file that it
       creates in the current working directory.  When <b>lgagent</b> identifies a directive, it executes the directive
       by passing the text of the directive to the <u>pseudoshell()</u> function (see <u><a href="../man3/platform.3.html">platform</a></u>(3)).  <b>lgagent</b> processes
       the line sets of a Load/Go source file in the order in which they appear in the file, so the text of a
       directive may reference a file that was created as the result of processing a prior file capsule in the
       same source file.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       "0" Load/Go remote agent processing has terminated.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lgfile</b> contains the Load/Go file capsules and directives that are to be processed.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       No environment variables apply.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       The following diagnostics may be issued to the <b>ion.log</b> log file:

       lgagent: can't attach to BP.
           Bundle Protocol is not running on this computer.  Run <u><a href="../man1/bpadmin.1.html">bpadmin</a></u>(1) to start BP.

       lgagent: can't open own endpoint.
           <u>own_endpoint_ID</u> is not a declared endpoint on the local ION node.  Run <u><a href="../man1/bpadmin.1.html">bpadmin</a></u>(1) to add it.

       lgagent: bundle reception failed.
           ION system problem.  Investigate and correct before restarting.

       lgagent cannot continue.
           lgagent  processing  problem.   See earlier diagnostic messages for details.  Investigate and correct
           before restarting.

       lgagent: no space for bundle content.
           ION system problem: have exhausted available SDR data store reserves.

       lgagent: can't receive bundle content.
           ION system problem: have exhausted available SDR data store reserves.

       lgagent: can't handle bundle delivery.
           ION system problem.  Investigate and correct before restarting.

       lgagent: pseudoshell failed.
           Error in directive line, usually an attempt to execute a non-existent administration program (e.g., a
           misspelled program name).  Terminates processing of source file content.

       A variety of other diagnostics noting source file parsing problems may also be  reported.   These  errors
       are  non-fatal  but  they  terminate  the  processing  of  the source file content from the most recently
       received bundle.
