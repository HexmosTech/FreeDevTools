</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       rstart - a sample implementation of a Remote Start client

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rstart</b> [-c <u>context</u>] [-g] [-l <u>username</u>] [-v] <u>hostname</u> <u>command</u> <u>args</u> <u>...</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Rstart</u>  is  a  simple  implementation of a Remote Start client as defined in "A Flexible Remote Execution
       Protocol Based on <b>rsh</b>".  It uses <u>rsh</u> as its underlying remote execution mechanism.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c</b> <u>context</u>
               This option specifies the <u>context</u> in which the command is to  be  run.   A  <u>context</u>  specifies  a
               general  environment  the  program  is  to  be run in.  The details of this environment are host-
               specific; the intent is that the client need not know how the environment must be configured.  If
               omitted, the context defaults to <b>X</b>.  This should be suitable for  running  X  programs  from  the
               host's "usual" X installation.

       <b>-g</b>      Interprets <u>command</u> as a <u>generic</u> <u>command</u>, as discussed in the protocol document.  This is intended
               to  allow  common  applications  to be invoked without knowing what they are called on the remote
               system.  Currently, the only generic commands defined are  <b>Terminal</b>,  <b>LoadMonitor</b>,  <b>ListContexts</b>,
               and <b>ListGenericCommands</b>.

       <b>-l</b> <u>username</u>
               This option is passed to the underlying <u>rsh</u>; it requests that the command be run as the specified
               user.

       <b>-v</b>      This  option  requests  that  <u>rstart</u>  be  verbose  in its operation.  Without this option, <u>rstart</u>
               discards output from the remote's <u>rstart</u> helper, and directs the  <u>rstart</u>  helper  to  detach  the
               program  from  the  <u>rsh</u> connection used to start it.  With this option, responses from the helper
               are displayed and the resulting program is not detached from the connection.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       This is a trivial implementation.  Far more sophisticated implementations  are  possible  and  should  be
       developed.

       Error  handling  is nonexistent.  Without <b>-v</b>, error reports from the remote are discarded silently.  With
       <b>-v</b>, error reports are displayed.

       The $DISPLAY environment variable is passed.  If it starts with a colon, the local hostname is prepended.
       The local domain name should be appended to unqualified host names, but isn't.

       The $SESSION_MANAGER environment variable should be passed, but isn't.

       X11 authority information is passed for the current display.

       ICE authority information should be passed, but isn't.  It  isn't  completely  clear  how  <u>rstart</u>  should
       select what ICE authority information to pass.

       Even  without  <b>-v</b>, the sample <u>rstart</u> helper will leave a shell waiting for the program to complete.  This
       causes no real harm and consumes relatively few resources, but if it is undesirable it can be avoided  by
       explicitly specifying the "exec" command to the shell, eg
       rstart somehost exec xterm
       This is obviously dependent on the command interpreter being used on the remote system; the example given
       will work for the Bourne and C shells.
