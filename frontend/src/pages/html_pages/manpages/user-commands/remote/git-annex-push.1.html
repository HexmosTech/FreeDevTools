</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       git-annex-push - push content to remotes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       git annex push <b>[remote</b> <b>...]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  command  pushes  content  to  remotes.  It  uploads both git repository content, and the content of
       annexed files.

       You can use <b>git</b> <b>push</b> and <b>git-annex</b> <b>copy</b> by hand to do the same thing as this command,  but  this  command
       handles several details, including making sure that the git-annex branch is pushed to the remote.

       When  using  git-annex,  often remotes are not bare repositories, because it's helpful to add remotes for
       nearby machines that you want to access the same annexed content. Pushing to a non-bare remote  will  not
       normally update the remote's current branch with changes from the local repository. (Unless the remote is
       configured with receive.denyCurrentBranch=updateInstead.)

       To  make  working  with such non-bare remotes easier, this command pushes not only local <b>master</b> to remote
       <b>master</b>, but also to remote <b>synced/master</b> (and similar with other branches). When <b>git-annex</b> <b>pull</b> (or  git-
       annex sync<b>)</b> <b>is</b> <b>later</b> <b>run</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>remote,</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>merge</b> <b>the</b> synced/ branches that were pushed to it.

       Some  special  remotes  allow exporting a tree of files to them (<b>exporttree=yes</b>), and this command can be
       used to push to those remotes as well as regular git remotes. See <a href="../man1/git-annex-export.1.html">git-annex-export</a>(1) for  details  about
       how   those   special  remotes  work.  In  order  for  this  command  to  export  to  a  special  remote,
       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-tracking-branch</b> also must be configured, and have the same  value  as  the  currently
       checked out branch.

       When  <a href="../man1/git-annex-adjust.1.html">git-annex-adjust</a>(1)  has  been  used  to  check out an adjusted branch, this command will propagate
       changes that have been made back to the parent branch, without propagating the adjustments.

       Normally this tries to upload the content of each annexed file that is in the working tree, to any remote
       that it's pushing to that does not have a copy.  To  control  which  files  are  uploaded  to  a  remote,
       configure  the  preferred content of the remote. When a file is not the preferred content of a remote, or
       of  the  local  repository,  this  command  will  try   to   drop   the   file's   content.    See   <a href="../man1/gitannex-preferred-content.1.html">git-</a>
       <a href="../man1/gitannex-preferred-content.1.html">annex-preferred-content</a>(1).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>[remote]</b>

              By  default,  this  command  pushes  to  all  available  remotes,  except  for  remotes  that have
              <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-push</b>     (or     <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-sync</b>)      set      to      false      or
              <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-readonly</b> set to true.

              By specifying the names of remotes (or remote groups), you can control which ones to push to.

       <b>--fast</b> Only push to the remotes with the lowest annex-cost value configured.

              When  a  list  of remotes (or remote groups) is provided, it picks from amoung those, otherwise it
              picks from amoung all remotes.

       <b>--only-annex</b> <b>-a</b>, <b>--not-only-annex</b>
              Only push the git-annex branch and annexed content to remotes, not other git branches.

              The <b>annex.synconlyannex</b> configuration can be set to true to make this be the default behavior.  To
              override such a setting, use <b>--not-only-annex</b>.

              When this is combined with --no-content, only the git-annex branch will be pushed.

       <b>--no-content</b>, <b>-g</b>, <b>--content</b>
              Use <b>--no-content</b> or <b>-g</b> to avoid uploading (and dropping) the content of annexed files.

              If you often use <b>--no-content</b>, you can set the <b>annex.synccontent</b> configuration to false to prevent
              uploading content by default.  The <b>--content</b> option overrides that configuration.

       <b>--content-of=path</b> <b>-C</b> <b>path</b>
              Only upload (or drop) annexed files in the given path.

              This option can be repeated multiple times with different paths.

              Note that this option does not prevent exporting other files to an "exporttree=yes" remote.

       <b>--all</b> <b>-A</b>
              Usually  this  command  operates  on  annexed  files  in the current branch.  This option makes it
              operate on all available versions of all annexed files (when preferred content settings allow).

              Note that preferred content settings that use <b>include=</b> or <b>exclude=</b> will only match the version  of
              files currently in the work tree, but not past versions of files.

       <b>--jobs=N</b> <b>-JN</b>
              Enables  parallel  pushing  with  up to the specified number of jobs running at once. For example:
              <b>-J10</b>

              Setting this to "cpus" will run one job per CPU core.

       <b>--cleanup</b>
              Removes the local and remote <b>synced/</b> branches, which were created and pushed by <b>git-annex</b> <b>push</b>  or
              <b>git-annex</b> <b>sync</b>. This option prevents all other activities.

              This  can  come  in handy when you've pushed a change to remotes and now want to reset your master
              branch back before that change. So you run <b>git</b> <b>reset</b> and force-push the master branch to  remotes,
              only to find that the next <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>merge</b> or <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>pull</b> brings the changes back. Why? Because
              the <b>synced/master</b> branch is hanging around and still has the change in it. Cleaning up the <b>synced/</b>
              branches prevents that problem.

       Also the <a href="../man1/git-annex-common-options.1.html">git-annex-common-options</a>(1) can be used.
