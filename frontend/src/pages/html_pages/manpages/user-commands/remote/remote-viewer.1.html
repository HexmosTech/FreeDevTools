</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       remote-viewer - a simple remote desktop client

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>remote-viewer</b> [OPTIONS] -- [URI]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>remote-viewer</b> is a simple remote display client. The supported protocols are SPICE and VNC.

       Starting remote-viewer without URI will open a simple dialog with an entry and a list of previously
       successfully accessed URI.

       The URI can also point to a connection settings file, see the CONNECTION FILE section for a description
       of the format.

       If URI is '-', then remote-viewer will read the standard input as a connection settings file and attempt
       to connect using it.

       In some circumstances the viewer may need to grab the mouse pointer. The default key sequence for
       releasing the grab is "Ctrl_L"+"Alt_L", however, this can be overridden using the "--hotkeys" argument
       documented below.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are accepted when running "remote-viewer":

       -h, --help
           Display command line help summary

       -V, --version
           Display program version number

       -v, --verbose
           Display information about the connection

       -z PCT, --zoom=PCT
           Zoom level of the display window in percentage. Range 10-400.

       -f, --full-screen
           Start with the windows maximized to fullscreen.

           If  supported,  the  remote  display  will  be  reconfigured  to  match  the  physical client monitor
           configuration, by enabling or disabling extra monitors as necessary. This is currently implemented by
           the Spice backend only and can be disabled by the "--auto-resize" arguemnt.

           To specify which client monitors are used in fullscreen mode, see the CONFIGURATION section below.

       --auto-resize &lt;always|never&gt;
           Controls whether it is permitted to attempt to resize the  remote  framebuffer  to  match  the  local
           window size. This currently defaults to on, but note that not all servers will support this.

       -t TITLE, --title TITLE
           Set the window title to <b>TITLE</b>

       -s, --shared
           Permitted a shared session with multiple clients

       --cursor auto|local
           Control  how  the  mouse  cursor  is rendered. "auto" is the default behaviour, which will honour the
           behaviour requested by the remote server. This may involve the server  remote  rendering  the  cursor
           into  the framebuffer, or sending the cursor details to the client to render.  "local" overrides this
           default to request that the local desktop cursor is always rendered regardless  of  what  the  server
           requests.  The  latter  is  rarely needed, but can be used if the server has a bad configuration that
           results in its own cursor being hidden.

       --debug
           Print debugging information

       -H HOTKEYS, --hotkeys HOTKEYS
           Set global hotkey bindings. By default, keyboard shortcuts only work when the  guest  display  widget
           does  not have focus.  Any actions specified in <b>HOTKEYS</b> will be effective even when the guest display
           widget       has       input       focus.       The        format        for        <b>HOTKEYS</b>        is
           &lt;action1&gt;=&lt;key1&gt;[+&lt;key2&gt;][,&lt;action2&gt;=&lt;key3&gt;[+&lt;key4&gt;]].  Key-names are case-insensitive. Valid actions
           are:  toggle-fullscreen, release-cursor, zoom-in, zoom-out, zoom-reset, secure-attention, usb-device-
           reset, smartcard-insert and smartcard-remove.  The "secure-attention" action sends a secure attention
           sequence (Ctrl+Alt+Del) to the guest. Examples:

             --hotkeys=toggle-fullscreen=shift+f11,release-cursor=shift+f12

             --hotkeys=release-cursor=ctrl+alt

           Note that hotkeys for which no binding is given are disabled. Although the hotkeys specified here are
           handled by the client, it is still possible to send these key combinations to the guest  via  a  menu
           item.

       -K, --keymap
           Remap and/or block supplied keypresses to the host. All key identifiers are case-sensitive and follow
           the naming convention as defined in gdkkeysyms.h without the GDK_KEY_ prefix.

           Running the application with --debug will display keypress symbols in the following way:
             "Key pressed was keycode='0x63', gdk_keyname='c'"
             "Key pressed was keycode='0xffeb', gdk_keyname='Super_L'"

           The            format            for            supplying            a           keymap           is:
           &lt;srcKeySym1&gt;=[&lt;destKeySym1&gt;][+&lt;destKeySym2][,&lt;srckeySym2&gt;=[&lt;destKeySym1]

           To block a keypress simply assign an empty parameter to the srcKeySym.

           Example:
             --keymap=Super_L=,Alt_L=,1=Shift_L+F1,2=Shift_L+F2

           This will block the Super_L (typically Windows Key) and ALT_L keypresses and remap key 1 to Shift F1,
           2 to Shift F2.

       -k, --kiosk
           Start in kiosk mode. In this mode, the application will start in fullscreen with minimal UI. It  will
           prevent  the  user from quitting or performing any interaction outside of usage of the remote desktop
           session.

           Note that it can't offer a complete secure solution by itself. Your kiosk system must have additional
           configuration and security settings to lock down the OS. In particular, you must configure or disable
           the window manager, limit the session capabilities, use some restart/watchdog mechanism,  disable  VT
           switching etc.

       --kiosk-quit &lt;never|on-disconnect&gt;
           By  default,  when  kiosk  mode  is  enabled, virt-viewer will remain open when the connection to the
           remote server is terminated. By setting kiosk-quit option to "on-disconnect" value, virt-viewer  will
           quit instead.

</pre><h4><b>HOTKEY</b></h4><pre>
       A  key  binding combination is described by a series of key strings separated by '+' that must be pressed
       together in order to activate the associated action.

       It must be composed of modifiers (shift, ctrl or alt) and a non-modifier key. For example, "shift+f11".

</pre><h4><b>CONNECTION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>remote-viewer</b> connection file is of INI file format, with a mandatory [virt-viewer] group and "type" key.

   <b>Example</b>
       Opening a file with the following content will start remote-viewer in fullscreen and connect to the  host
       "betsiboka" using the SPICE protocol:

        [virt-viewer]
        type=spice
        host=betsiboka
        port=5900
        fullscreen=1

   <b>Key</b> <b>list</b>
       "version" (string)
           If  remote-viewer  version  number isn't greater or equal to the required version, an error is raised
           with the expected version.

           The version format accepted is a list of integers separated by '.'. It can be followed by a dash  '-'
           and an additional build number with the same format.

           Version  comparison  is  done  by  comparing  each  integer  from  the list one by one. If any of the
           component is not a number, the version comparison will fail and consider  that  the  2  versions  are
           considered to be the same.

       "versions" (osid:version list)
           This  is  a  list of osid:version couples separated by ';'. osid is an arbitrary string, version is a
           version number in the same format as in the 'version' field. A given couple  indicates  that  remote-
           viewer  builds matching the given 'osid' (fedora22, debian7, ...) must be at least version 'version'.
           For consistency, it's recommended to use libosinfo OS shortids as the osid.

       "newer-version-url" (string)
           If specified, this field is an URL which will be displayed to the user when a version check fails.

       "type" (string, mandatory)
           The session type, either "spice", "vnc" or "ovirt".

       "unix-path" (string)

       "host" (string)
           The server host to connect to.

       "port" (integer)
           The server port to connect to.

       "tls-port" (integer)
           The server TLS/SSL port to connect to.

       "username" (string)
           The username for the session authentication.

           The list of session channels to disable.

           The current SPICE channels are: main, display, inputs, cursor, playback, record, smartcard, usbredir.

       "tls-ciphers" (string)
           Set the cipher list to use for the secure connection, in textual OpenSSL  cipher  list  format.  (see
           <b><a href="../man1/ciphers.1.html">ciphers</a></b>(1))

       "title" (string)
           String to present in the window title.

       "fullscreen" (boolean)
           Opens the client windows in fullscreen.

       "ca" (string)
           CA  certificate in PEM format (using "\n" to separate the lines). This will be used to verify the SSL
           certificate used for SPICE TLS sessions.

       "host-subject" (string)
           Verify the certificate subject matches with the given subject.

       "toggle-fullscreen" (hotkey string)
           Key binding for entering and leaving fullscreen mode. (see HOTKEY for description of expected string)

       "release-cursor" (hotkey string)
           Key binding for releasing cursor grab. (see HOTKEY for description of expected string)

       "zoom-in" (hotkey string)
           Key binding for zooming in and enlarging client window size. (see HOTKEY for description of  expected
           string)

       "zoom-out" (hotkey string)
           Key  binding for zooming out and reducing client window size. (see HOTKEY for description of expected
           string)

       "zoom-reset" (hotkey string)
           Key binding for reseting zoom and client window size. (see HOTKEY for description of expected string)

           Key binding for inserting emulated smartcard. (see HOTKEY for description of expected string)

       "smartcard-remove" (hotkey string)
           Key binding for removing emulated smartcard. (see HOTKEY for description of expected string)

       "color-depth" (integer)
           Set the color depth of the guest display (16 or 32).

       "disable-effects" (string list)
           A list of desktop effects to disable in the remote guest.

           The effects that can be disabled with SPICE are: wallpaper, font-smooth, animation or all.

       "enable-smartcard" (boolean)
           Set to 1 to enable client smartcard redirection.

       "enable-usbredir" (boolean)
           Set to 1 to enable client USB device redirection.

       "enable-usb-autoshare" (boolean)
           Set to 1 to enable client USB devices auto-sharing.

       "usb-filter" (string)
           Set a string specifying a filter to use to determine which USB devices to  autoconnect  when  plugged
           in, a filter consists of one or more rules. Where each rule has the form of:

           "class,vendor,product,version,allow"

           Use -1 for class/vendor/product/version to accept any value.

           And the rules themselves are concatenated like this:

           "rule1|rule2|rule3"

       "secure-channels" (string list)
           The list of session channels to secure.

           The current SPICE channels are: main, display, inputs, cursor, playback, record, smartcard, usbredir.

       "delete-this-file" (boolean)

       "proxy" (string)
           A proxy URL to tunnel the connection through.

           At  the  time  of  writing  this  documentation,  the  only supported proxy method with Spice is HTTP
           CONNECT.

           For example, to tunnel connection through foobar  host  HTTP  proxy  on  port  8080,  use  the  value
           "<a href="http://foobar">http://foobar</a>:8080".

   <b>oVirt</b> <b>Support</b>
       The  connection  file can also carry some oVirt-specific options when oVirt support is compiled in. These
       options are used to interact with oVirt REST API.  This is currently only used in order to  show  a  menu
       allowing  to  change  the  CD  image being used by the virtual machine from remote-viewer user interface.
       These options go in an optional [ovirt] group.

       "host" (string, mandatory)
           The oVirt instance to connect to. This corresponds to the hostname one would connect  to  access  the
           oVirt user or admin portal.

       "vm-guid" (string, mandatory)
           GUID of the oVirt virtual machine to connect to.

       "jsessionid" (string)
           Value  to  set  the  'jsessionid'  cookie to. With oVirt 3.6, setting this authentication cookie to a
           valid value will allow to interact with the oVirt REST API without being asked for credentials.

       "sso-token" (string)
           Value to set the 'Authorization' header to. With oVirt 4.0  or  newer,  setting  this  authentication
           header  to  a  valid  value  will  allow  to interact with the oVirt REST API without being asked for
           credentials.

       "ca" (string)
           CA certificate in PEM format (using "\n" to separate the lines). This will be used  to  validate  the
           certificate used for the oVirt REST https session remote-viewer will establish.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       A  small  number  of  configuration options can be controlled by editing the settings file located in the
       user configuration directory:

           &lt;USER-CONFIG-DIR&gt;/virt-viewer/settings

       This file is a text file in INI format, with application options in the [virt-viewer] group and per-guest
       options in a group identified by the guest's UUID. The application options should not be edited manually.
       There is also a special [fallback] group which specifies options  for  all  guests  that  don't  have  an
       explicit group.

       For  each  guest,  the  initial  fullscreen  monitor configuration can be specified by using the <b>monitor-</b>
       <b>mapping</b> key. This configuration only takes effect when the -f/--full-screen option is specified.

       The value of this key is a list of mappings between a guest display and a client monitor. Each mapping is
       separated    by    a    semicolon     character,     and     the     mappings     have     the     format
       &lt;GUEST-DISPLAY-ID&gt;:&lt;CLIENT-MONITOR-ID&gt;.

       For  example,  to  map  guest  displays  1  and 2 to client monitors 2 and 3 for the guest with a UUID of
       e4591275-d9d3-4a44-a18b-ef2fbc8ac3e2, use:

           [e4591275-d9d3-4a44-a18b-ef2fbc8ac3e2]
           monitor-mapping=1:2;2:3

       The monitor-mapping must contain ids of all displays  from  1  to  the  last  desired  display  id,  e.g.
       "monitor-mapping=3:3" is invalid because mappings for displays 1 and 2 are not specified.

       Configuration key <b>share-clipboard</b> contains a boolean value. If it's "true", then clipboard is shared with
       guests if clipboard sharing is supported by used protocol.
