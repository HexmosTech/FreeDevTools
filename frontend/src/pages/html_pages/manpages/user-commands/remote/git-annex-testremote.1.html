</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       git-annex-testremote - test transfers to/from a remote

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       git annex testremote <b>remote</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This tests a remote by sending objects to it, downloading objects from it, etc.

       It's  safe  to  run  in an existing repository (the repository contents are not altered), although it may
       perform expensive data transfers.

       It's best to make a new remote for testing purposes. While the test tries to clean up  after  itself,  if
       the  remote  being  tested had a bug, the cleanup might fail, leaving test data in the remote. Also, some
       special remotes don't support removal of data that has been stored in them, so test data won't be able to
       be cleaned up when testing those.

       Testing will use the remote's configuration, automatically varying  the  chunk  sizes,  and  with  simple
       shared  encryption  disabled and enabled, and exporttree disabled and enabled. If the remote is readonly,
       testing is limited to checking various properties of downloading from it.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--fast</b>

              Perform a smaller set of tests.

       <b>--test-readonly=file</b>
              Normally, random objects are generated for the test and are sent to the remote.  When  a  readonly
              remote  is being tested, that cannot be done, and so you need to specify some annexed files to use
              in the testing, using this option. Their content needs to be present in the readonly remote  being
              tested, and in the local repository.

              This option can be repeated.

       <b>--size=NUnits</b>
              Tune the base size of generated objects. The default is 1MiB.

       Also the <a href="../man1/git-annex-common-options.1.html">git-annex-common-options</a>(1) can be used.
