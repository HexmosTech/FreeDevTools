       just-import-git - import one Git repository to a multi-repository configuration

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>just-import-git</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]...  <u>URL</u> [<u>foreign</u> <u>repository</u> <u>name</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Extend  an  existing  <b><a href="../man5/just-mr-repository-config.5.html">just-mr-repository-config</a></b>(5)  by  adding  one  Git  repository.   In  doing so, the
       dependencies declared in  the  imported  repository  are  added  as  well  and  <u>"file"</u>  repositories  are
       transformed to <u>"subdir"</u> parts of the imported repository.  This solves the problem, that a repository can
       refer  to itself only as <u>"."</u> in a portable way.  The importing party, however, always knows the URL it is
       importing from.

       The imported repositories are renamed in a way that no conflicts with already present repositories arise.
       The repositories pulled in as dependencies are named in a way to remind for which repositories they  came
       as  a  dependency.  This renaming is taken into account at all places repositories are referred to, i.e.,
       the <u>"bindings"</u> field, as well as roots defined by reference to other repositories.

       Only the main parts of repositories are imported  (<u>"repository"</u>,  <u>"bindings"</u>,  names,  and  roots).   The
       <u>"pragma"</u> part, as well as unknown fields are dropped.

       The repository to import is specified by its URL

       The resulting configuration is printed on standard output.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--as</b> <u>NAME</u>
       Specify  the  name  the  imported  repository  should have in the final configuration.  If not specified,
       default to the name the repository has in the configuration file of  the  repository  imported.   In  any
       case, the name is amended if it conflicts with an already existing name.

       <b>-b</b> <u>BRANCH</u>
       The  branch  in  the  imported  repository  to use; this branch is also recorded as the branch to follow.
       Defaults to <u>"master"</u>.

       <b>-C</b> <u>CONFIGFILE</u>
       Use the specified file as the configuration to import into.  The string <u>-</u> is treated as a request to take
       the config from stdin; so a file called <u>-</u> has to be described as <u>.</u>/<u>-</u>, or similar.  If  not  specified,  a
       config file is searched for in the same way as <b>just-mr</b> does when invoked with <b>--norc</b>.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
       Output a usage message and exit.

       <b>--map</b> <u>THEIRS</u> <u>OURS</u>
       Map  repositories  from  the imported configuration to already existing ones.  Those repositories are not
       imported (and the search for their transitive dependency is omitted) and instead  the  specified  already
       existing  repository  is used.  This is useful, if a sufficiently compatible repository already exists in
       the configuration.

       <b>-R</b> <u>RELPATH</u>
       Use the file, specified by path relative to the repository root, as multi-repository specification in the
       imported repository.  If not specified, for a config file is searched in the same way  as  <b>just-mr</b>  does,
       when  invoked  with <b>--no-rc</b>, however leaving out searches relative to global roots (<u>"home"</u> and <u>"system"</u>).
       In other words, <u>repos.json</u> and <u>etc/repos.json</u> are tried if this option is not given.

       <b>--plain</b>
       Pretend the foreign multi-repository specification is the canonical one for a single repository.  Useful,
       if the repository to be imported does not have a repository configuration or should be  imported  without
       dependencies.

       <b>--absent</b>
       Add the pragma {"absent": true} to all imported repositories.

       <b>--mirror</b> <u>URL</u>
       Provides  an  alternative  fetch  location  for the imported repository.  Specifying this option multiple
       times will accumulate URLs in the order they appear on the command line.  These URLs  will  not  be  used
       during  the  import,  but  instead  will  be  recorded as the value of the "mirrors" key in the resulting
       configuration of the imported repository.  See <b><a href="../man5/just-mr-repository-config.5.html">just-mr-repository-config</a></b>(5).

       <b>--inherit-env</b> <u>VAR</u>
       Specify, for the imported repository, environment variables to be inherited when fetching the  repository
       by  calling  git.   These  variables  will  not  be taken into account during the import (where the whole
       environment is inherited), but instead will be recorded as the value for the "inherit  env"  key  in  the
       resulting configuration of the imported repository.  See <b><a href="../man5/just-mr-repository-config.5.html">just-mr-repository-config</a></b>(5).
