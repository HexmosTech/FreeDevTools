</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       reprepro - produce, manage and sync a local repository of Debian packages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>reprepro</b> <b>--help</b>

       <b>reprepro</b> [ <u>options</u> ] <u>command</u> [ <u>per-command-arguments</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       reprepro  is  a tool to manage a repository of Debian packages (.deb, .udeb, .dsc, ...).  It stores files
       either being injected manually or downloaded from some other repository (partially) mirrored into a pool/
       hierarchy.  Managed packages and checksums of files are stored in a Berkeley  DB  database  file,  so  no
       database  server  is needed.  Checking signatures of mirrored repositories and creating signatures of the
       generated Package indices is supported.

       Former working title of this program was mirrorer.

</pre><h4><b>GLOBAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options can be specified before the command. Each affects a different subset of commands and  is  ignored
       by other commands.

       <b>-h</b> <b>--help</b>
              Displays a short list of options and commands with description.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>-V,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Be more verbose. Can be applied multiple times. One uppercase <b>-V</b> counts as five lowercase <b>-v.</b>

       <b>--silent</b>
              Be less verbose. Can be applied multiple times. One <b>-v</b> and one <b>-s</b> cancel each other out.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--force</b>
              This option is ignored, as it no longer exists.

       <b>-b,</b> <b>--basedir</b> <u>basedir</u>
              Sets  the  base-dir  all  other  default directories are relative to.  If none is supplied and the
              <b>REPREPRO_BASE_DIR</b> environment variable is not set either, the current directory will be used.

       <b>--outdir</b> <u>outdir</u>
              Sets the base-dir of the repository to manage, i.e. where the <b>pool/</b> subdirectory resides.  And  in
              which  the  <b>dists/</b>  directory  is placed by default.  If this starts with '<b>+b/</b>', it is relative to
              basedir.

              The default for this is <u>basedir</u>.

       <b>--confdir</b> <u>confdir</u>
              Sets the directory where the configuration is searched in.

              If this starts with '<b>+b/</b>', it is relative to basedir.

              If none is given, <b>+b/conf</b> (i.e. <u>basedir</u><b>/conf</b>) will be used.

       <b>--distdir</b> <u>distdir</u>
              Sets the directory  to  generate  index  files  relatively  to.  (i.e.  things  like  Packages.gz,
              Sources.gz and Release.gpg)

              If this starts with '<b>+b/</b>', it is relative to basedir, if starting with '<b>+o/</b>' relative to outdir.

              If none is given, <b>+o/dists</b> (i.e. <u>outdir</u><b>/dists</b>) is used.

              <b>Note:</b>  apt  has  <b>dists</b>  hard-coded  in  it, so this is mostly only useful for testing or when your
              webserver pretends another directory structure than your physical layout.

              <b>Warning:</b> Beware when changing this forth and back between  two  values  not  ending  in  the  same
              directory.  Reprepro only looks if files it wants are there. If nothing of the content changed and
              there  is  a  file  it  will not touch it, assuming it is the one it wrote last time, assuming any
              different <b>--distdir</b> ended in the same directory.  So  either  clean  a  directory  before  setting
              <b>--distdir</b> to it or do an <b>export</b> with the new one first to have a consistent state.

       <b>--logdir</b> <u>logdir</u>
              The  directory  where  files  generated  by the <b>Log:</b> directive are stored if they have no absolute
              path.

              If this starts with '<b>+b/</b>', it is relative to basedir, if starting with '<b>+o/</b>' relative  to  outdir,
              with '<b>+c/</b>' relative to confdir.

              If none is given, <b>+b/logs</b> (i.e. <u>basedir</u><b>/logs</b>) is used.

       <b>--dbdir</b> <u>dbdir</u>
              Sets the directory where reprepro keeps its databases.

              If  this  starts with '<b>+b/</b>', it is relative to basedir, if starting with '<b>+o/</b>' relative to outdir,
              with '<b>+c/</b>' relative to confdir.

              If none is given, <b>+b/db</b> (i.e. <u>basedir</u><b>/db</b>) is used.

              <b>Note:</b> This is permanent data, no cache. One has almost to regenerate  the  whole  repository  when
              this is lost.

       <b>--listdir</b> <u>listdir</u>
              Sets  the  directory where it downloads indices to when importing from other repositories. This is
              temporary data and can be safely deleted when not in an update run.

              If this starts with '<b>+b/</b>', it is relative to basedir, if starting with '<b>+o/</b>' relative  to  outdir,
              with '<b>+c/</b>' relative to confdir.

              If none is given, <b>+b/lists</b> (i.e. <u>basedir</u><b>/lists</b>) is used.

       <b>--morguedir</b> <u>morguedir</u>
              Files deleted from the pool are stored into <u>morguedir</u>.

              If  this  starts with '<b>+b/</b>', it is relative to basedir, if starting with '<b>+o/</b>' relative to outdir,
              with '<b>+c/</b>' relative to confdir.

              If none is given, deleted files are just deleted.

       <b>--methoddir</b> <u>methoddir</u>
              Look in <u>methoddir</u> instead of <b><a href="file:/usr/lib/apt/methods">/usr/lib/apt/methods</a></b> for methods to call when  importing  from  other
              repositories.

       <b>-C,</b> <b>--component</b> <u>components</u>
              Limit  the  specified  command  to  this  components only.  This will force added packages to this
              components, limit removing packages from this components, only list packages in  this  components,
              and/or otherwise only look at packages in this components, depending on the command in question.

              Multiple components are specified by separating them with <b>|</b>, as in <b>-C</b> <b>'main|contrib'</b>.

       <b>-A,</b> <b>--architecture</b> <u>architectures</u>
              Limit  the  specified  command  to  this  architectures only.  (i.e. only list such packages, only
              remove packages  from  the  specified  architectures,  or  otherwise  only  look  at/act  on  this
              architectures depending on the specific command).

              Multiple architectures are specified by separating them with <b>|</b>, as in <b>-A</b> <b>'sparc|i386'</b>.

              Note  that  architecture  <b>all</b>  packages  can be included to each architecture but are then handled
              separately.  Thus by using <b>-A</b> in a specific way one can have different versions of an architecture
              <b>all</b> package in different architectures of the same distribution.

       <b>-T,</b> <b>--type</b> dsc|deb|udeb
              Limit the specified command to this packagetypes only.  (i.e. only list such packages, only remove
              such packages, only include such packages, ...)

       <b>-S,</b> <b>--section</b> <u>section</u>
              Overrides the section of inclusions. (Also override possible override files)

       <b>-P,</b> <b>--priority</b> <u>priority</u>
              Overrides the priority of inclusions. (Also override possible override files)

       <b>--export=</b>(<b>silent-never</b>|<b>never</b>|<b>changed</b>|<b>lookedat</b>|<b>force</b>)
              This option specify whether and how the high level actions (e.g. install,  update,  pull,  delete)
              should export the index files of the distributions they work with.

       <b>--export=lookedat</b>
              In  this  mode  every  distribution the action handled will be exported, unless there was an error
              possibly corrupting it.
              <u>Note</u> that only missing files and files whose intended content changed between before and after the
              action will be written.  To get a guaranteed current export, use the <b>export</b> action.
              For backwards compatibility, <b>lookedat</b> is also available under  the  old  name  <b>normal</b>.   The  name
              <b>normal</b> is deprecated and will be removed in future versions.

       <b>--export=changed</b>
              In  this  mode  every  distribution  actually  changed will be exported, unless there was an error
              possibly corrupting it.  (i.e. if nothing changed, not even missing files will be created.)
              <u>Note</u> that only missing files and files whose intended content changed between before and after the
              action will be written.  To get a guaranteed current export, use the <b>export</b> action.

       <b>--export=force</b>
              Always export all distributions looked at, even if there was some error possibly bringing it  into
              a inconsistent state.

       <b>--export=never</b>
              No index files are exported. You will have to call <b>export</b> later.
              <u>Note</u> that you most likely additionally need the <b>--keepunreferencedfiles</b> option, if you do not want
              some of the files pointed to by the untouched index files to vanish.

       <b>--export=silent-never</b>
              Like never, but suppress most output about that.

       <b>--ignore=</b><u>what</u>
              Ignore errors of type <u>what</u>. See the section <b>ERROR</b> <b>IGNORING</b> for possible values.

       <b>--nolistsdownload</b>
              When running <b>update</b>, <b>checkupdate</b> or <b>predelete</b> do not download any Release or index files.  This is
              hardly  useful except when you just run one of those command for the same distributions.  And even
              then reprepro is usually good in not downloading except <b>Release</b> and <b>Release.gpg</b> files again.

       <b>--nothingiserror</b>
              If nothing was done, return with exitcode 1 instead of the usual 0.

              Note that "nothing was done" means the primary purpose  of  the  action  in  question.   Auxiliary
              actions  (opening  and  closing the database, exporting missing files with --export=lookedat, ...)
              usually do not count.  Also note that this is not very well tested.  If you find  an  action  that
              claims to have done something in some cases where you think it should not, please let me know.

       <b>--keeptemporaries</b>
              Do  not  delete  temporary <b>.new</b> files when exporting a distribution fails.  (reprepro first create
              <b>.new</b> files in the <b>dists</b> directory and only if everything is generated,  all  files  are  put  into
              their  final  place at once.  If this option is not specified and something fails, all are deleted
              to keep <b>dists</b> clean).

       <b>--keepunreferencedfiles</b>
              Do not delete files that are no longer used because the package they are from is  deleted/replaced
              with a newer version from the last distribution it was in.

       <b>--keepunusednewfiles</b>
              The  include,  includedsc, includedeb and processincoming by default delete any file they added to
              the pool that is not marked used at the end of the operation.  While this keeps the pool clean and
              allows changing before trying to add again, this needs copying and checksum calculation every time
              one tries to add a file.

       <b>--keepdirectories</b>
              Do not try to rmdir parent directories after files or directories have  been  removed  from  them.
              (Do  this  if  your directories have special permissions you want keep, do not want to be pestered
              with warnings about errors to  remove  them,  or  have  a  buggy  rmdir  call  deleting  non-empty
              directories.)

       <b>--ask-passphrase</b>
              Ask  for  passphrases  when signing things and one is needed. This is a quick and dirty and unsafe
              implementation using the obsolete <b><a href="../man3/getpass.3.html">getpass</a>(3)</b> function with the description gpgme is supplying.  So
              the prompt will look quite funny and support for passphrases with more than 8 characters depend on
              your libc.  Use of this option is not recommended. Use gpg-agent with pinentry instead.

              (With current versions of gnupg you need to set <b>pinentry-mode</b>  <b>loopback</b>  in  your  .gnupg/gpg.conf
              file  to  use  <b>--ask-passphrase</b>.   Without  that  option gnupg uses the much safer and recommended
              pinentry instead).

       <b>--noskipold</b>
              When updating do not skip targets where no  new  index  files  and  no  files  marked  as  already
              processed are available.

              If  you  changed  a  script to preprocess downloaded index files or changed a Listfilter, you most
              likely want to call reprepro with --noskipold.

       <b>--waitforlock</b> <u>count</u>
              If there is a lockfile indicating another instance of reprepro is currently  using  the  database,
              retry <u>count</u> times after waiting for 10 seconds each time.  The default is 0 and means to error out
              instantly.

       <b>--spacecheck</b> <b>full</b>|<b>none</b>
              The default is <b>full</b>:
              In  the  update  commands, check for every to be downloaded file which filesystem it is on and how
              much space is left.
              To disable this behaviour, use <b>none</b>.

       <b>--dbsafetymargin</b> <u>bytes-count</u>
              If checking for free space,  reserve  <u>byte-count</u>  bytes  on  the  filesystem  containing  the  <b>db/</b>
              directory.   The  default is 104857600 (i.e. 100MB), which is quite large.  But as there is no way
              to know in advance how large the databases will grow and libdb is extremely touchy in that regard,
              lower only when you know what you do.

       <b>--safetymargin</b> <u>bytes-count</u>
              If checking for free space, reserve  <u>byte-count</u>  bytes  on  filesystems  not  containing  the  <b>db/</b>
              directory.  The default is 1048576 (i.e. 1MB).

       <b>--noguessgpgtty</b>
              Don't  set  the  environment  variable  <b>GPG_TTY</b>,  even  when  it is not set, stdin is terminal and
              <b><a href="file:/proc/self/fd/0">/proc/self/fd/0</a></b> is a readable symbolic link.

       <b>--gnupghome</b>
              Set the <b>GNUPGHOME</b> evnironment variable to the given directory as argument  to  this  option.   And
              your  gpg will most likely use the content of this variable instead of "<a href="file:~/.gnupg">~/.gnupg</a>".  Take a look at
              <b><a href="../man1/gpg.1.html">gpg</a></b>(1) to be sure.  This option in the command line is usually not very useful, as it is  possible
              to set the environment variable directly.  Its main reason for existence is that it can be used in
              <u>conf</u><b>/options</b>.

       <b>--gunzip</b> <u>gz-uncompressor</u>
              While  reprepro links against <b>libz</b>, it will look for the program given with this option (or <b>gunzip</b>
              if not given)  and  use  that  when  uncompressing  index  files  while  downloading  from  remote
              repositories.   (So  that  downloading  and  uncompression  can  happen at the same time).  If the
              program is not found or is <b>NONE</b> (all-uppercase) then uncompressing will always be done  using  the
              built  in  uncompression method.  The program has to accept the compressed file as stdin and write
              the uncompressed file into stdout.

       <b>--bunzip2</b> <u>bz2-uncompressor</u>
              When uncompressing downloaded index files or if not linked against <b>libbz2</b> reprepro will  use  this
              program  to  uncompress <b>.bz2</b> files.  The default value is <b>bunzip2</b>.  If the program is not found or
              is <b>NONE</b> (all-uppercase) then uncompressing will always be done using the  built  in  uncompression
              method  or not be possible if not linked against <b>libbz2</b>.  The program has to accept the compressed
              file as stdin and write the uncompressed file into stdout.

       <b>--unlzma</b> <u>lzma-uncompressor</u>
              When uncompressing downloaded index files or if not linked against <b>liblzma</b> reprepro will use  this
              program  to  uncompress <b>.lzma</b> files.  The default value is <b>unlzma</b>.  If the program is not found or
              is <b>NONE</b> (all-uppercase) then uncompressing lzma files will always  be  done  using  the  built  in
              uncompression  method or not be possible if not linked against <b>liblzma</b>.  The program has to accept
              the compressed file as stdin and write the uncompressed file into stdout.

       <b>--unxz</b> <u>xz-uncompressor</u>
              When uncompressing downloaded index files or if not linked against <b>liblzma</b> reprepro will use  this
              program  to  uncompress  <b>.xz</b> files.  The default value is <b>unxz</b>.  If the program is not found or is
              <b>NONE</b> (all-uppercase) then  uncompressing  xz  files  will  always  be  done  using  the  built  in
              uncompression  method or not be possible if not linked against <b>liblzma</b>.  The program has to accept
              the compressed file as stdin and write the uncompressed file into stdout.

       <b>--lunzip</b> <u>lzip-uncompressor</u>
              When trying to uncompress or read lzip compressed files, this program will be used.   The  default
              value  is  <b>lunzip</b>.   If  the program is not found or is <b>NONE</b> (all-uppercase) then uncompressing lz
              files will not be possible.  The program has to accept the compressed file as stdin and write  the
              uncompressed  file  into  stdout.   Note that .lz support is <b>DEPRECATED</b> and will be removed in the
              future.

       <b>--list-max</b> <u>count</u>
              Limits the output of <b>list</b>, <b>listmatched</b> and <b>listfilter</b> to the first <u>count</u> results.  The default  is
              0, which means unlimited.

       <b>--list-skip</b> <u>count</u>
              Omitts the first <u>count</u> results from the output of <b>list</b>, <b>listmatched</b> and <b>listfilter</b>.

       <b>--list-format</b> <u>format</u>
              Set  the  output  format  of  <b>list</b>, <b>listmatched</b> and <b>listfilter</b> commands.  The format is similar to
              dpkg-query's <b>--showformat</b>: fields are specified  as  <b>${</b><u>fieldname</u><b>}</b>  or  <b>${</b><u>fieldname</u><b>;</b><u>length</u><b>}</b>.   Zero
              length  or no length means unlimited.  Positive numbers mean fill with spaces right, negative fill
              with spaces left.

              <b>\n</b>, <b>\r</b>, <b>\t</b>, <b>\0</b> are new-line, carriage-return, tabulator and zero-byte.  Backslash (<b>\</b>) can be  used
              to escape every non-letter-or-digit.

              The  special field names <b>$identifier</b>, <b>$architecture</b>, <b>$component</b>, <b>$type</b>, <b>$codename</b> denote where the
              package was found.

              The special field names <b>$source</b> and <b>$sourceversion</b> denote the source and source version a  package
              belongs to.  (i.e.  <b>${$source}</b> will either be the same as <b>${source}</b> (without a possible version in
              parentheses at the end) or the same as <b>${package}</b>.

              The  special  field names <b>$basename</b>, <b>$filekey</b> and <b>$fullfilename</b> denote the first package file part
              of this entry (i.e. usually the .deb, .udeb or  .dsc  file)  as  basename,  as  filekey  (filename
              relative  to the outdir) and the full filename with outdir prepended (i.e. as relative or absolute
              as your outdir (or basedir if you did not set outdir) is).

              When <b>--list-format</b> is not given or <b>NONE</b>, then the default is equivalent to
              <b>${$identifier}</b> <b>${package}</b> <b>${version}\n</b>.

              Escaping digits or letters not  in  above  list,  using  dollars  not  escaped  outside  specified
              constructs,  or  any field names not listed as special and not consisting entirely out of letters,
              digits and minus signs have undefined behaviour and  might  change  meaning  without  any  further
              notice.

              If  you  give  this  option  on  the command line, don't forget that $ is also interpreted by your
              shell.  So you have to properly  escape  it.   For  example  by  putting  the  whole  argument  to
              --list-format in single quotes.

       <b>--show-percent</b>
              When  downloading  packages,  show  each completed percent of completed package downloads together
              with the size of completely downloaded packages.  (Repeating this option increases  the  frequency
              of this output).

       <b>--onlysmalldeletes</b>
              The  pull and update commands will skip every distribution in which one target loses more than 20%
              of its packages (and at least 10).

              Using this option (or putting it in the options config file) can avoid removing  large  quantities
              of data but means you might often give <b>--noonlysmalldeletes</b> to override it.

       <b>--restrict</b> <u>src</u>[<b>=</b><u>version</u>|<b>:</b><u>type</u>]
              Restrict  a  <b>pull</b>  or  <b>update</b>  to only act on packages belonging to source-package <u>src</u>.  Any other
              package will not be updated (unless it  matches  a  <b>--restrict-bin</b>).   Only  packages  that  would
              otherwise  be  updated  or  are  at least marked with <b>hold</b> in a <b>FilterList</b> or <b>FilerSrcList</b> will be
              updated.

              The action can be restricted to a source version using a equal sign or  changed  to  another  type
              (see FilterList) using a colon.

              This  option  can  be given multiple times to list multiple packages, but each package may only be
              named once (even when there are different versions or types).

       <b>--restrict-binary</b> <u>name</u>[<b>=</b><u>version</u>|<b>:</b><u>type</u>]
              Like <b>--restrict</b> but restrict to binary  packages  (<b>.deb</b>  and  <b>.udeb</b>).   Source  packages  are  not
              upgraded unless they appear in a <b>--restrict</b>.

       <b>--restrict-file</b> <u>filename</u>
              Like <b>--restrict</b> but read a whole file in the <b>FilterSrcList</b> format.

       <b>--restrict-file-bin</b> <u>filename</u>
              Like <b>--restrict-bin</b> but read a whole file in the <b>FilterList</b> format.

       <b>--endhook</b> <u>hookscript</u>

              Run  the  specified  <u>hookscript</u> once reprepro exits.  It will get the usual <b>REPREPRO_</b>* environment
              variables set (or unset) and additionally a variable <b>REPREPRO_EXIT_CODE</b> that is the exit code with
              which reprepro would have exited (the hook is always called once the  initial  parsing  of  global
              options  and  the command name is done, no matter if reprepro did anything or not).  Reprepro will
              return to the calling process with the exitcode of this  script.   Reprepro  has  closed  all  its
              databases  and removed all its locks, so you can run reprepro again in this script (unless someone
              else did so in the same repository before, of course).

              The only advantage over running that command always directly after reprepro is that you  can  some
              environment variables set and cannot so easily forget it if this option is in conf/options.

              The  script is supposed to be located relative to <u>confdir</u>, unless its name starts with <b>/</b>, <b>./</b>, <b>+b/</b>,
              <b>+o/</b>, or <b>+c/</b> and the name may not start (except in the cases given before) with a <b>+</b>.

              An example script looks like:
               <b>#!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a></b>

               <b>if</b> <b>[</b> <b>"$REPREPRO_EXIT_CODE"</b> <b>-ne</b> <b>0</b> <b>]</b> <b>;</b> <b>then</b>
                    <b>exit</b> <b>"$REPREPRO_EXIT_CODE"</b>
               <b>fi</b>

               <b>echo</b> <b>"congratulations,</b> <b>reprepro</b> <b>with</b> <b>arguments:</b> <b>$*"</b>
               <b>echo</b> <b>"seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>run</b> <b>successfully.</b> <b>REPREPRO_</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>is:"</b>
               <b>set</b> <b>|</b> <b>grep</b> <b>^REPREPRO_</b>

               <b>exit</b> <b>0</b>

       <b>--outhook</b> <u>hookscript</u>
              <u>hookscript</u> is called with a <b>.outlog</b> file as argument (located in <u>logdir</u>) containing a  description
              of all changes made to <u>outdir</u>.

              The  script is supposed to be located relative to <u>confdir</u>, unless its name starts with <b>/</b>, <b>./</b>, <b>+b/</b>,
              <b>+o/</b>, or <b>+c/</b> and the name may not start (except in the cases given before) with a <b>+</b>.

              For a format of the <b>.outlog</b> files generated for this  script  see  the  <b>manual.html</b>  shipped  with
              reprepro.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>export</b> [ <u>codenames</u> ]
              Generate all index files for the specified distributions.

              This  regenerates all files unconditionally.  It is only useful if you want to be sure <b>dists</b> is up
              to date, you called some other actions with <b>--export=never</b> before or you want to create an initial
              empty but fully equipped <b>dists/</b><u>codename</u> directory.

        [ <b>--delete</b> ] <b>createsymlinks</b> [ <u>codenames</u> ]
              Creates <u>suite</u> symbolic links in the <b>dists/</b>-directory pointing to the corresponding <u>codename</u>.

              It will not create links, when multiple of the given codenames would be linked from the same suite
              name, or if the link already exists (though when <b>--delete</b> is given it will delete already existing
              symlinks)

       <b>list</b> <u>codename</u> [ <u>packagename</u> ]
              List all packages (source and binary, except when <b>-T</b> or <b>-A</b> is given) with the given  name  in  all
              components  (except when <b>-C</b> is given) and architectures (except when <b>-A</b> is given) of the specified
              distribution.  If no package name is given, list everything.  The format  of  the  output  can  be
              changed with <b>--list-format</b>.  To only get parts of the result, use <b>--list-max</b> and <b>--list-skip</b>.

       <b>listmatched</b> <u>codename</u> <u>glob</u>
              as  list, but does not list a single package, but all packages matching the given shell-like <u>glob</u>.
              (i.e. <b>*</b>, <b>?</b> and <b>[</b><u>chars</u><b>]</b> are allowed).

              Examples:

              <b>reprepro</b> <b>-b</b> <b>.</b> <b>listmatched</b> <b>test2</b> <b>'linux-*'</b> lists all packages starting with <b>linux-</b>.

       <b>listfilter</b> <u>codename</u> <u>condition</u>
              as list, but does not list a single package, but all packages matching the given condition.

              The format of the formulas is those of the dependency lines in Debian packages' control files with
              some extras.  That means a formula consists of names of fields with a possible condition  for  its
              content in parentheses.  These atoms can be combined with an exclamation mark '!' (meaning not), a
              pipe  symbol '|' (meaning or) and a comma ',' (meaning and).  Additionally parentheses can be used
              to change binding (otherwise '!' binds more than '|' than ',').

              The values given in the search expression are directly alphabetically compared to the  headers  in
              the respective index file.  That means that each part <u>Fieldname</u> <b>(</b><u>cmp</u> <u>value</u><b>)</b> of the formula will be
              true  for  exactly  those  package  that  have in the <b>Package</b> or <b>Sources</b> file a line starting with
              <u>fieldname</u> and a value is alphabetically <u>cmp</u> to <u>value</u>.

              Additionally since reprepro 3.11.0, '<b>%</b>' can be used as comparison operator,  denoting  matching  a
              name with shell like wildcard (with '<b>*</b>', '<b>?</b>' and '<b>[</b>..<b>]</b>').

              The special field names starting with '<b>$</b>' have special meaning (available since 3.11.1):

              <b>$Version</b>

              The version of the package, comparison is not alphabetically, but as Debian version strings.

              <b>$Source</b>

              The source name of the package.

              <b>$SourceVersion</b>

              The source version of the package.

              <b>$Architecture</b>

              The architecture the package is in (listfilter) or to be put into.

              <b>$Component</b>

              The component the package is in (listfilter) or to be put into.

              <b>$Packagetype</b>

              The packagetype of the package.

              Examples:

              <b>reprepro</b>  <b>-b</b>  <b>.</b> <b>listfilter</b> <b>test2</b> <b>'Section</b> <b>(==</b> <b>admin)'</b> will list all packages in distribution test2
              with a Section field and the value of that field being <b>admin</b>.

              <b>reprepro</b> <b>-b</b> <b>.</b> <b>-T</b> <b>deb</b> <b>listfilter</b> <b>test2</b> <b>'Source</b> <b>(==</b> <u>blub</u><b>)</b> <b>|</b> <b>(</b> <b>!Source</b> <b>,</b> <b>Package</b> <b>(==</b>  <u>blub</u><b>)</b>  <b>)'</b>  will
              find  all  .deb  Packages  with  either a Source field blub or no Source field and a Package field
              blub.  (That means all package generated by a source package <u>blub</u>, except those also specifying  a
              version number with its Source).

              <b>reprepro</b>  <b>-b</b>  <b>.</b>  <b>-T</b>  <b>deb</b> <b>listfilter</b> <b>test2</b> <b>'$Source</b> <b>(==</b><u>blub</u><b>)</b> is the better way to do this (but only
              available since 3.11.1).

              <b>reprepro</b> <b>-b</b> <b>.</b> <b>listfilter</b> <b>test2</b> <b>'$PackageType</b> <b>(==deb),</b> <b>$Source</b> <b>(==</b><u>blub</u><b>)</b> is another (less efficient)
              way.

              <b>reprepro</b> <b>-b</b> <b>.</b> <b>listfilter</b> <b>test2</b> <b>'Package</b> <b>(%</b> <b>linux-*-2.6*)'</b> lists all packages with  names  starting
              with <b>linux-</b> and later having an <b>-2.6</b>.

       <b>ls</b> <u>package-name</u>
              List the versions of the specified package in all distributions.

       <b>lsbycomponent</b> <u>package-name</u>
              Like ls, but group by component (and print component names).

       <b>remove</b> <u>codename</u> <u>package-names</u>
              Delete  all  packages  in  the  specified distribution, that have package name listed as argument.
              (i.e. remove all packages <b>list</b> with the same arguments and options  would  list,  except  that  an
              empty package list is not allowed.)

              Note  that  like  any other operation removing or replacing a package, the old package's files are
              unreferenced and thus may be automatically deleted  if  this  was  their  last  reference  and  no
              <b>--keepunreferencedfiles</b> specified.

       <b>removematched</b> <u>codename</u> <u>glob</u>
              Delete all packages <b>listmatched</b> with the same arguments would list.

       <b>removefilter</b> <u>codename</u> <u>condition</u>
              Delete all packages <b>listfilter</b> with the same arguments would list.

       <b>removesrc</b> <u>codename</u> <u>source-name</u> [<u>version</u>]
              Remove all packages in distribution <u>codename</u> belonging to source package <u>source-name</u>.  (Limited to
              those with source version <u>version</u> if specified).

              If  package tracking is activated, it will use that information to find the packages, otherwise it
              traverses all package indices for the distribution.

       <b>removesrcs</b> <u>codename</u> <u>source-name</u>[<b>=</b><u>version</u>] <u>...</u>
              Like <b>removesrc</b>, but can be given multiple source names and source versions must  be  specified  by
              appending '<b>=</b>' and the version to the name (without spaces).

       <b>update</b> [ <u>codenames</u> ]
              Sync  the  specified  distributions  (all  if  none  given)  as specified in the config with their
              upstreams. See the description of <b>conf/updates</b> below.

       <b>checkupdate</b> [ <u>codenames</u> ]
              Same like <b>update</b>, but will show what it will change instead of actually changing it.

       <b>dumpupdate</b> [ <u>codenames</u> ]
              Same like <b>checkupdate</b>, but less suiteable for humans and more suitable for computers.

       <b>predelete</b> [ <u>codenames</u> ]
              This will determine which packages a <b>update</b> would delete or replace  and  remove  those  packages.
              This  can  be  useful for reducing space needed while upgrading, but there will be some time where
              packages are vanished from the lists so clients will mark them as obsolete.  Plus  if  you  cannot
              download  a  updated  package  in  the  (hopefully)  following update run, you will end up with no
              package at all instead of an old one.  This will also blow up <b>.diff</b> files if  you  are  using  the
              pdiff  example or something similar.  So be careful when using this option or better get some more
              space so that update works.

       <b>cleanlists</b>
              Delete all files in <u>listdir</u> (default <u>basedir</u><b>/lists</b>) that do not belong to any update rule for  any
              distribution.   I.e. all files are deleted in that directory that no <b>update</b> command in the current
              configuration can use.  (The files are usually left there, so if they are needed again they do not
              need to be downloaded again. Though in many easy cases not even those files will be needed.)

       <b>pull</b> [ <u>codenames</u> ]
              pull in  newer  packages  into  the  specified  distributions  (all  if  none  given)  from  other
              distributions in the same repository.  See the description of <b>conf/pulls</b> below.

       <b>checkpull</b> [ <u>codenames</u> ]
              Same like <b>pull</b>, but will show what it will change instead of actually changing it.

       <b>dumppull</b> [ <u>codenames</u> ]
              Same like <b>checkpull</b>, but less suiteable for humans and more suitable for computers.

       <b>includedeb</b> <u>codename</u> <u>.deb-filename</u>
              Include  the  given  binary Debian package (.deb) in the specified distribution, applying override
              information and guessing all values not given and guessable.

       <b>includeudeb</b> <u>codename</u> <u>.udeb-filename</u>
              Same like <b>includedeb</b>, but for .udeb files.

       <b>includedsc</b> <u>codename</u> <u>.dsc-filename</u>
              Include the given Debian source package (.dsc, including other files  like  .orig.tar.gz,  .tar.gz
              and/or  .diff.gz)  in  the  specified distribution, applying override information and guessing all
              values not given and guessable.

              Note that .dsc files do not contain section or priority,  but  the  Sources.gz  file  needs  them.
              reprepro  tries  to parse .diff and .tar files for it, but is only able to resolve easy cases.  If
              reprepro fails to extract those automatically, you have to either specify a  DscOverride  or  give
              them via <b>-S</b> and <b>-P</b>

       <b>include</b> <u>codename</u> <u>.changes-filename</u>
              Include  in  the  specified  distribution  all  packages  found and suitable in the <u>.changes</u> file,
              applying override information guessing all values not given and guessable.

       <b>processincoming</b> <u>rulesetname</u> [<u>.changes-file</u>]
              Scan an incoming directory and process the .changes files found there.  If a filename is supplied,
              processing is limited to that  file.   <u>rulesetname</u>  identifies  which  rule-set  in  <b>conf/incoming</b>
              determines  which incoming directory to use and in what distributions to allow packages into.  See
              the section about this file for more information.

       <b>check</b> [ <u>codenames</u> ]
              Check if all packages in the specified distributions have all files needed properly registered.

       <b>checkpool</b> [ <b>fast</b> ]
              Check if all files believed to be in the pool are actually still there and have the known  md5sum.
              When <b>fast</b> is specified md5sum is not checked.

       <b>collectnewchecksums</b>
              Calculate  all  supported  checksums  for  all files in the pool.  (Versions prior to 3.3 did only
              store md5sums, 3.3 added sha1, 3.5 added sha256).

       <b>translatelegacychecksums</b>
              Remove the legacy <b>files.db</b> file after making sure  all  information  is  also  found  in  the  new
              <b>checksums.db</b>  file.   (Alternatively  you  can call <b>collecnewchecksums</b> and remove the file on your
              own.)

       <b>rereference</b>
              Forget which files are needed and recollect this information.

       <b>dumpreferences</b>
              Print out which files are marked to be needed by whom.

       <b>dumpunreferenced</b>
              Print a list of all filed believed to be in the pool, that are not known to be needed.

       <b>deleteunreferenced</b>
              Remove all known files (and forget them) in the pool not marked to be needed by anything.

       <b>deleteifunreferenced</b> [ <u>filekeys</u> ]
              Remove the given files (and forget them) in the pool  if  they  are  not  marked  to  be  used  by
              anything.   If  no  command  line arguments are given, stdin is read and every line treated as one
              filekey.  This is mostly useful together with <b>--keepunreferenced</b> in <b>conf/options</b> or in  situations
              where  one does not want to run <b>deleteunreferenced</b>, which removes all files eligible to be deleted
              with this command.

       <b>reoverride</b> [ <u>codenames</u> ]
              Reapply the override files to the given distributions (Or only parts thereof  given  by  <b>-A</b>,<b>-C</b>  or
              <b>-T</b>).

              Note:  only  the  control  information is changed. Changing a section to a value, that would cause
              another component to be guessed, will not cause any warning.

       <b>redochecksums</b> [ <u>codenames</u> ]
              Readd the information about file checksums to the package indices.

              Usually the package's control information is created at  inclusion  time  or  imported  from  some
              remote source and not changed later.  This command modifies it to readd missing checksum types.

              Only   checksums   already   known   are   used.   To  update  known  checksums  about  files  run
              <b>collectnewchecksums</b> first.

       <b>dumptracks</b> [ <u>codenames</u> ]
              Print out all information about tracked source packages in the given distributions.

       <b>retrack</b> [ <u>codenames</u> ]
              Recreate a tracking database for the specified distributions.  This contains ouf of  three  steps.
              First  all  files  marked  as part of a source package are set to unused.  Then all files actually
              used are marked as thus.  Finally tidytracks is called remove everything no longer needed with the
              new information about used files.

              (This behaviour, though a bit longsome, keeps even files only kept because of tracking  mode  <b>keep</b>
              and  files  not  otherwise  used  but kept due to <b>includechanges</b> or its relatives.  Before version
              3.0.0 such files were lost by running retrack).

       <b>removealltracks</b> [ <u>codenames</u> ]
              Removes all source package tracking information for the given distributions.

       <b>removetrack</b>   <u>codename</u>   <u>sourcename</u>   <u>version</u>
              Remove the trackingdata of the given version of a given sourcepackage from a  given  distribution.
              This also removes the references for all used files.

       <b>tidytracks</b> [ <u>codenames</u> ]
              Check  all  source package tracking information for the given distributions for files no longer to
              keep.

       <b>copy</b> <u>destination-codename</u> <u>source-codename</u> <u>packages...</u>
              Copy the given packages from one distribution to another.  The packages are  copied  verbatim,  no
              override   files  are  consulted.   Only  components  and  architectures  present  in  the  source
              distribution are copied.

       <b>copysrc</b> <u>destination-codename</u> <u>source-codename</u> <u>source-package</u> [<u>versions</u>]
              look at each package (where package means, as usual, every package be it dsc, deb or udeb) in  the
              distribution  specified  by  <u>source-codename</u>  and identifies the relevant source package for each.
              All packages matching the specified <u>source-package</u> name (and any <u>version</u> if specified) are  copied
              to the <u>destination-codename</u> distribution.  The packages are copied verbatim, no override files are
              consulted.  Only components and architectures present in the source distribution are copied.

       <b>copymatched</b> <u>destination-codename</u> <u>source-codename</u> <u>glob</u>
              Copy packages matching the given glob (see <b>listmatched</b>).

              The  packages  are  copied  verbatim,  no  override  files  are  consulted.   Only  components and
              architectures present in the source distribution are copied.

       <b>copyfilter</b> <u>destination-codename</u> <u>source-codename</u> <u>formula</u>
              Copy packages matching the given formula  (see  <b>listfilter</b>).   (all  versions  if  no  version  is
              specified).   The  packages are copied verbatim, no override files are consulted.  Only components
              and architectures present in the source distribution are copied.

       <b>restore</b> <u>codename</u> <u>snapshot</u> <u>packages...</u>

       <b>restoresrc</b> <u>codename</u> <u>snapshot</u> <u>source-epackage</u> [<u>versions</u>]

       <b>restorefilter</b> <u>destination-codename</u> <u>snapshot</u> <u>formula</u>

       <b>restorematched</b> <u>destination-codename</u> <u>snapshot</u> <u>glob</u>
              Like the copy commands, but do not copy from another distribution, but from a  snapshot  generated
              with  <b>gensnapshot</b>.   Note  that  this  blindly  trusts  the  contents  of the files in your <b>dists/</b>
              directory and does no checking.

       <b>clearvanished</b>
              Remove all package databases  that  no  longer  appear  in  <b>conf/distributions</b>.   If  <b>--delete</b>  is
              specified,  it  will  not  stop  if  there are still packages left.  Even without <b>--delete</b> it will
              unreference files still marked as needed by this target.  (Use <b>--keepunreferenced</b>  to  not  delete
              them if that was the last reference.)

              Do not forget to remove all exported package indices manually.

       <b>gensnapshot</b>   <u>codename</u>   <u>directoryname</u>
              Generate   a   snapshot   of   the   distribution   specified   by   <u>codename</u>   in  the  directory
              <u>dists</u><b>/</b><u>codename</u><b>/snapshots/</b><u>directoryname</u><b>/</b> and reference all needed files in the pool  as  needed  by
              that.  No Content files are generated and no export hooks are run.

              Note  that  there  is  currently  no  automated  way  to  remove  that  snapshot  again  (not even
              clearvanished will unlock the referenced files after the distribution itself vanished).  You  will
              have  to  remove  the  directory  yourself  and  tell  reprepro  to  <b>unreferencesnapshot</b>  <u>codename</u>
              <u>directoryname</u> before <b>deleteunreferenced</b> will delete the files from the pool locked by this.

              To access such a snapshot with apt, add something like the following to your sources.list file:
              <b>deb</b> <b>method://as/without/snapshot</b> <u>codename</u><b>/snapshots/</b><u>name</u> <b>main</b>

       <b>unreferencesnapshot</b>   <u>codename</u>   <u>directoryname</u>
              Remove all references generated by an <b>genshapshot</b> with the same arguments.  This allows  the  next
              <b>deleteunferenced</b>  call  to  delete  those files.  (The indicies in <b>dists/</b> for the snapshot are not
              removed.)

       <b>rerunnotifiers</b> [ <u>codenames</u> ]
              Run all external scripts specified in the <b>Log:</b> options of the specified distributions.

       <b>build-needing</b> <u>codename</u> <u>architecture</u> [ <u>glob</u> ]
              List source packages (matching <u>glob</u>) that likely need a build on the given architecture.

              List all source package  in  the  given  distribution  without  a  binary  package  of  the  given
              architecture  built from that version of the source, without a <b>.changes</b> or <b>.log</b> file for the given
              architecture, with an Architecture field including <b>any</b>, <u>os</u><b>-any</b> (with <u>os</u> being the part before  the
              hyphen  in  the  architecture or <b>linux</b> if there is no hyphen) or the architecture and at least one
              package in the Binary field not yet available.

              If instead of <u>architecture</u>  the  term  <b>any</b>  is  used,  all  architectures  are  iterated  and  the
              architecture is printed as fourth field in every line.

              If the <u>architecture</u> is <b>all</b>, then only source packages with an Architecture field including <b>all</b> are
              considered  (i.e.  as above with real architectures but <b>any</b> does not suffice).  Note that dpkg-dev
              &lt;&lt; 1.16.1 does not both set <b>any</b> and <b>all</b> so source packages building  both  architecture  dependent
              and independent packages will never show up unless built with a new enough dpkg-source).

       <b>translatefilelists</b>
              Translate  the file list cache within <u>db</u><b>/contents.cache.db</b> into the new format used since reprepro
              3.0.0.

              Make sure you have at least half of the  space  of  the  current  <u>db</u><b>/contents.cache.db</b>  file  size
              available in that partition.

       <b>flood</b> <u>distribution</u> [<u>architecture</u>]
              For  each  architecture  of  <u>distribution</u> (or for the one specified) add architecture <b>all</b> packages
              from other architectures (but the same component or packagetype) under the following conditions:

               Packages are only upgraded, never downgraded.
               If there is a package not being architecture <b>all</b>, then architecture  <b>all</b>  packages  of  the  same
              source from the same source version are preferred over those that have no such binary sibling.
               Otherwise the package with the highest version wins.

              You  can  restrict  with architectures are looked for architecture <b>all</b> packages using <b>-A</b> and which
              components/packagetypes are flooded by <b>-C</b>/<b>-T</b> as usual.

              There are mostly two use cases  for  this  command:  If  you  added  an  new  architecture  to  an
              distribution  and  want  to  copy  all  architecture  <b>all</b> packages to it.  Or if you included some
              architecture all packages only to  some  architectures  using  <b>-A</b>  to  avoid  breaking  the  other
              architectures  for  which  the binary packages were still missing and now want to copy it to those
              architectures were  they  are  unlikely  to  break  something  (because  a  newbinary  is  already
              available).

       <b>unusedsources</b> [<u>distributions</u>]
              List all source packages for which no binary package build from them is found.

       <b>sourcemissing</b> [<u>distributions</u>]
              List  all  binary packages for which no source package is found (the source package must be in the
              same distribution, but source packages only kept by package tracking is enough).

       <b>reportcruft</b> [<u>distributions</u>]
              List all source package versions that either have a source package and no longer a binary  package
              or  binary  packages  left  without  source  package in the index. (Unless sourcemissing also list
              packages where the source package in only in the pool due to enabled tracking but no longer in the
              index).

       <b>sizes</b> [ <u>codenames</u> ]
              List the size of all packages in the distributions specified or in all distributions.

              Each row contains 4 numbers, each being a number of bytes in a set of  packages,  which  are:  The
              packages  in  this  distribution  (including anything only kept because of tracking), the packages
              only in this distribution (anything in this distribution  and  a  snapshot  of  this  distribution
              counts  as  only  in  this distribution), the packages in this distribution and its snapshots, the
              packages only in this distribution or its snapshots.

              If more than one distribution is selected, also list a sum of those (in which 'Only' means only in
              selected ones, and not only only in one of the selected ones).

       <b>repairdescriptions</b> [ <u>codenames</u> ]
              Look for binary packages only having a short description and try to get the long description  from
              the .deb file (and also remove a possible Description-md5 in this case).

   <b>internal</b> <b>commands</b>
       These  are  hopefully never needed, but allow manual intervention.  <b>WARNING:</b> Is is quite easy to get into
       an inconsistent and/or unfixable state.

       <b>_detect</b> [ <u>filekeys</u> ]
              Look for the files, which <u>filekey</u> is given as argument or as a line of the input (when run without
              arguments), and calculate their md5sum and add them to the list of known files.  (Warning: this is
              a low level operation, no input validation or normalization is done.)

       <b>_forget</b> [ <u>filekeys</u> ]
              Like <b>_detect</b> but remove the given <u>filekey</u> from the list of known files.  (Warning: this is  a  low
              level operation, no input validation or normalization is done.)

       <b>_listmd5sums</b>
              Print a list of all known files and their md5sums.

       <b>_listchecksums</b>
              Print a list of all known files and their recorded checksums.

       <b>_addmd5sums</b>
              alias for the newer

       <b>_addchecksums</b>
              Add  information  of  known  files (without any check done) in the strict format of _listchecksums
              output (i.e. don't dare to use a single space anywhere more than needed).

       <b>_dumpcontents</b> <u>identifier</u>
              Printout all the stored information of the specified part of the repository. (Or in  other  words,
              the content the corresponding Packages or Sources file would get)

              This command is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

       <b>_addreference</b> <u>filekey</u> <u>identifier</u>
              Manually mark <u>filekey</u> to be needed by <u>identifier</u>

       <b>_addreferences</b> <u>identifier</u> [ <u>filekeys</u> ]
              Manually  mark  one or more <u>filekeys</u> to be needed by <u>identifier</u>.  If no command line arguments are
              given, stdin is read and every line treated as one filekey.

       <b>_removereference</b> <u>identifier</u> <u>filekey</u>
              Manually remove the given mark that the file is needed by this identifier.

       <b>_removereferences</b> <u>identifier</u>
              Remove all references what is needed by <u>identifier.</u>

       <b>__extractcontrol</b> <u>.deb-filename</u>
              Look what reprepro believes to be the content of the <b>control</b> file of the specified .deb-file.

       <b>__extractfilelist</b> <u>.deb-filename</u>
              Look what reprepro believes to be the list of files of the specified .deb-file.

       <b>_fakeemptyfilelist</b> <u>filekey</u>
              Insert an empty filelist for <u>filekey</u>. This is a evil hack around broken .deb files that cannot  be
              read by reprepro.

       <b>_addpackage</b> <u>codenam</u> <u>filename</u> <u>packages...</u>
              Add  packages  from  the  specified  filename  to  part specified by <b>-C</b> <b>-A</b> and <b>-T</b> of the specified
              distribution.  Very strange things can happen if you use it improperly.

       <b>__dumpuncompressors</b>
              List what compressions format can be uncompressed and how.

       <b>__uncompress</b> <u>format</u> <u>compressed-file</u> <u>uncompressed-file</u>
              Use builtin or external uncompression to uncompress the specified file  of  the  specified  format
              into the specified target.

       <b>_listcodenames</b>
              Print - on per line - the codenames of all configured distributions.

       <b>_listconfidentifiers</b> <u>identifier</u> [ <u>distributions...</u> ]
              Print  -  one  per line - all identifiers of subdatabases as derived from the configuration.  If a
              list of distributions is given, only identifiers of those are printed.

       <b>_listdbidentifiers</b> <u>identifier</u> [ <u>distributions...</u> ]
              Print - one per line - all identifiers of subdatabases in the current database.  This  will  be  a
              subset  of the ones printed by <b>_listconfidentifiers</b> or most commands but <b>clearvanished</b> will refuse
              to run, and depending on the database compatibility version, will include all  those  if  reprepro
              was run since the config was last changed.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIG</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>reprepo</b>  uses  three config files, which are searched in the directory specified with <b>--confdir</b> or in the
       <b>conf/</b> subdirectory of the <u>basedir</u>.

       If a file <b>options</b> exists, it is parsed line by line.  Each line can be the long name of  a  command  line
       option (without the --) plus an argument, where possible.  Those are handled as if they were command line
       options  given  before  (and  thus  lower  priority than) any other command line option.  (and also lower
       priority than any environment variable).

       To allow command line options to override  options  file  options,  most  boolean  options  also  have  a
       corresponding form starting with <b>--no</b>.

       (The  only exception is when the path to look for config files changes, the options file will only opened
       once and of course before any options within the options file are parsed.)

       The file <b>distributions</b> is always needed and describes what distributions to manage, while <b>updates</b> is only
       needed when syncing with external repositories and <b>pulls</b> is only needed when syncing with repositories in
       the same reprepro database.

       The last three are in the format control files in Debian are in, i.e. paragraphs separated by empty lines
       consisting of fields. Each field consists of a fieldname, followed by a colon,  possible  whitespace  and
       the data. A field ends with a newline not followed by a space or tab.

       Lines starting with # as first character are ignored, while in other lines the # character and everything
       after it till the newline character are ignored.

       A  paragraph can also consist of only a single field "<b>!include:</b>" which causes the named file (relative to
       confdir unless starting with <b>~/</b>, <b>+b/</b>, <b>+c/</b> or <b>/</b> ) to be read as if it was found at this place.

       Each of the three files or a file included as described above can also be a directory, in which case  all
       files it contains with a filename ending in <b>.conf</b> and not starting with <b>.</b>  are read.

   <b>conf/distributions</b>
       <b>Codename</b>
              This  required  field is the unique identifier of a distribution and used as directory name within
              <b>dists/</b> It is also copied into the Release files.

              Note that this name is not supposed to change.  You most  likely  <b>never</b>  <b>ever</b>  want  a  name  like
              <b>testing</b>  or  <b>stable</b>  here  (those  are  suite  names and supposed to point to another distribution
              later).

       <b>Suite</b>  This optional field is simply copied into the Release files. In  Debian  it  contains  names  like
              stable,  testing  or  unstable.  To  create  symlinks  from  the  Suite  to  the Codename, use the
              <b>createsymlinks</b> command of reprepro.

       <b>FakeComponentPrefix</b>
              If this field is present, its argument is added - separated by a slash -  before  every  Component
              written  to  the main Release file (unless the component already starts with it), and removed from
              the end of the Codename and Suite fields in that file.  Also if a component starts  with  it,  its
              directory in the dists dir is shortened by this.
              So

               <b>Codename:</b> <b>bla/updates</b>
               <b>Suite:</b> <b>foo/updates</b>
               <b>FakeComponentPrefix:</b> <b>updates</b>
               <b>Components:</b> <b>main</b> <b>bad</b>

              will create a Release file with

               <b>Codename:</b> <b>bla</b>
               <b>Suite:</b> <b>foo</b>
               <b>Components:</b> <b>updates/main</b> <b>updates/bad</b>

              in it, but otherwise nothing is changed, while

               <b>Codename:</b> <b>bla/updates</b>
               <b>Suite:</b> <b>foo/updates</b>
               <b>FakeComponentPrefix:</b> <b>updates</b>
               <b>Components:</b> <b>updates/main</b> <b>updates/bad</b>

              will also create a Release file with

               <b>Codename:</b> <b>bla</b>
               <b>Suite:</b> <b>foo</b>
               <b>Components:</b> <b>updates/main</b> <b>updates/bad</b>

              but  the  packages  will  actually  be in the components <b>updates/main</b> and <b>updates/bad</b>, most likely
              causing the same file using duplicate storage space.

              This makes the distribution look more like Debian's security archive, thus  work  around  problems
              with apt's workarounds for that.

       <b>AlsoAcceptFor</b>
              A  list of distribution names.  When a <b>.changes</b> file is told to be included into this distribution
              with the <b>include</b> command and the distribution header of that file is neither the codename, nor the
              suite  name,  nor  any  name  from  the  list,  a  <b>wrongdistribution</b>  error  is  generated.    The
              <b>process_incoming</b>  command  will also use this field, see the description of <b>Allow</b> and <b>Default</b> from
              the <b>conf/incoming</b> file for more information.

       <b>Version</b>
              This optional field is simply copied into the Release files.

       <b>Origin</b> This optional field is simply copied into the Release files.

       <b>Label</b>  This optional field is simply copied into the Release files.

       <b>NotAutomatic</b>
              This optional field is simply copied into  the  Release  files.   (The  value  is  handled  as  an
              arbitrary string, though anything but <b>yes</b> does not make much sense right now.)

       <b>ButAutomaticUpgrades</b>
              This  optional  field  is  simply  copied  into  the  Release  files.  (The value is handled as an
              arbitrary string, though anything but <b>yes</b> does not make much sense right now.)

       <b>Description</b>
              This optional field is simply copied into the Release files.

       <b>Architectures</b>
              This required field lists the binary architectures within this distribution  and  if  it  contains
              <b>source</b> (i.e. if there is an item <b>source</b> in this line this Distribution has source. All other items
              specify  things  to  be  put  after  "binary-"  to  form  directory  names  and be checked against
              "Architecture:" fields.)

              This will also be copied into the Release files. (With exception of the <b>source</b>  item,  which  will
              not occur in the topmost Release file whether it is present here or not)

       <b>Components</b>
              This  required field lists the component of a distribution. See <b>GUESSING</b> for rules which component
              packages are included into by default. This will also be copied into the Release files.

       <b>UDebComponents</b>
              Components with a debian-installer subhierarchy containing .udebs.  (E.g. simply "main")

       <b>Update</b> When this field is present, it describes which update rules are used for this distribution.  There
              also can be a magic rule minus ("-"), see below.

       <b>Pull</b>   When  this  field  is present, it describes which pull rules are used for this distribution.  Pull
              rules are like Update rules, but get their stuff from other distributions and  not  from  external
              sources.  See the description for <b>conf/pulls</b>.

       <b>SignWith</b>
              When  this  field  is  present,  a  Release.gpg  file will be generated.  If the value is "yes" or
              "default", the default key of gpg is used.  If the field starts with an exlamation mark ("!"), the
              given script is executed to do the signing.  Otherwise the value will  be  given  to  libgpgme  to
              determine to key to use.

              If there are problems with signing, you can try
              <b>gpg</b> <b>--list-secret-keys</b> <u>value</u>
              to  see  how  gpg  could interprete the value.  If that command does not list any keys or multiple
              ones, try to find some other value (like the keyid), that gpg can more  easily  associate  with  a
              unique key.

              If this key has a passphrase, you need to use gpg-agent or the insecure option <b>--ask-passphrase</b>.

              A '<b>!</b>' hook script is looked for in the confdir, unless it starts with <b>~/</b>, <b>./</b>, <b>+b/</b>, <b>+o/</b>, <b>+c/</b> or <b>/</b> .
              Is  gets  three command line arguments: The filename to sign, an empty argument or the filename to
              create with an inline signature (i.e. InRelease) and an empty argument or the filename  to  create
              an  detached  signature  (i.e.  Release.gpg).   The  script may generate no Release.gpg file if it
              choses to (then the repository will look like unsigned for older clients),  but  generating  empty
              files is not allowed.  Reprepro waits for the script to finish and will abort the exporting of the
              distribution  this signing is part of unless the scripts returns normally with exit code 0.  Using
              a space after ! is recommended to avoid incompatibilities with possible future extensions.

       <b>DebOverride</b>
              When this field is present, it describes the override file used when including .deb files.

       <b>UDebOverride</b>
              When this field is present, it describes the override file used when including .udeb files.

       <b>DscOverride</b>
              When this field is present, it describes the override file used when including .dsc files.

       <b>DebIndices</b>, <b>UDebIndices</b>, <b>DscIndices</b>
              Choose what kind of Index files to export. The first part describes what the Index file  shall  be
              called.   The second argument determines the name of a Release file to generate or not to generate
              if missing.  Then at least one of "<b>.</b>", "<b>.gz</b>", "<b>.xz</b>"  or  "<b>.bz2</b>"  specifying  whether  to  generate
              uncompressed  output, gzipped output, bzip2ed output or any combination.  (bzip2 is only available
              when compiled with bzip2 support, so it might not be available when you compiled it on  your  own,
              same for xz and liblzma).  If an argument not starting with dot follows, it will be executed after
              all index files are generated.  (See the examples for what argument this gets).  The default is:
              DebIndices: Packages Release . .gz
              UDebIndices: Packages . .gz
              DscIndices: Sources Release .gz

       <b>ExportOptions</b>
              Options to modify how and if exporting is done:
              <b>noexport</b>  Never  export  this  distribution.   That  means there will be no directory below <b>dists/</b>
              generated and the distribution is only useful to copy packages to other distributions.
              <b>keepunknown</b> Ignore unknown files and directories in the exported directory.  This is currently the
              only available option and the default, but might change in  the  future,  so  it  can  already  be
              requested explicitly.

       <b>Contents</b>
              Enable  the  creation  of  Contents  files  listing  all the files within the binary packages of a
              distribution.  (Which is quite slow, you have been warned).

              In earlier versions, the first argument was a rate at which to extract file lists.   As  this  did
              not work and was no longer easily possible after some factorisation, this is no longer supported.

              The  arguments  of  this field is a space separated list of options.  If there is a <b>udebs</b> keyword,
              <b>.udeb</b>s are also listed (in a file called <b>uContents-</b><u>architecture</u>.)  If there is a  <b>nodebs</b>  keyword,
              <b>.deb</b>s  are not listed.  (Only useful together with <b>udebs</b>) If there is at least one of the keywords
              <b>.</b>, <b>.gz</b>, <b>.xz</b> and/or <b>.bz2</b>, the Contents files  are  written  uncompressed,  gzipped  and/or  bzip2ed
              instead of only gzipped.

              If  there  is  a <b>percomponent</b> then one Contents-<u>arch</u> file per component is created.  If there is a
              <b>allcomponents</b> then one global Contents-<u>arch</u> file is  generated.   If  both  are  given,  both  are
              created.  If none of both is specified then <b>percomponent</b> is taken as default (earlier versions had
              other defaults).

              The  switches  <b>compatsymlink</b>  or <b>nocompatsymlink</b> (only possible if <b>allcomponents</b> was not specified
              explicitly) control whether a compatibility symlink is created so old versions of apt-file looking
              for the component independent filenames at least see the contents of the first component.

              Unless <b>allcomponents</b> is given, <b>compatsymlinks</b> currently is the default, but that  will  change  in
              some future (current estimate: after wheezy was released)

       <b>ContentsArchitectures</b>
              Limit  generation  of  Contents files to the architectures given.  If this field is not there, all
              architectures are processed.  An empty field means no architectures are processed, thus  not  very
              useful.

       <b>ContentsComponents</b>
              Limit  what components are processed for the <b>Contents-</b><u>arch</u> files to the components given.  If this
              field is not there, all components are processed.  An empty field is equivalent to specify  <b>nodebs</b>
              in the <b>Contents</b> field, while a non-empty field overrides a <b>nodebs</b> there.

       <b>ContentsUComponents</b>
              Limit  what  components  are  processed  for the uContents files to the components given.  If this
              field is not there and there is the <b>udebs</b> keyword  in  the  Contents  field,  all  .udebs  of  all
              components  are put in the <b>uContents.</b><u>arch</u> files.  If this field is not there and there is no <b>udebs</b>
              keyword in the Contents field, no <b>uContents-</b><u>arch</u> files are generated at all.  A  non-empty  fields
              implies  generation  of  <b>uContents-</b><u>arch</u> files (just like the <b>udebs</b> keyword in the Contents field),
              while an empty one causes no <b>uContents-</b><u>arch</u> files to be generated.

       <b>Uploaders</b>
              Specifies a file (relative to confdir if not starting with <b>~/</b>, <b>+b/</b>, <b>+c/</b> or <b>/</b> ) to specify  who  is
              allowed  to  upload  packages.  Without this there are no limits, and this file can be ignored via
              <b>--ignore=uploaders</b>.  See the section <b>UPLOADERS</b> <b>FILES</b> below.

       <b>Tracking</b>
              Enable the (experimental) tracking of source packages.  The argument list needs to contain exactly
              one of the following:
              <b>keep</b> Keeps all files of a given source package, until that is deleted explicitly via  <b>removetrack</b>.
              This  is  currently  the  only  possibility to keep older packages around when all indices contain
              newer files.
              <b>all</b> Keep all files belonging to a given source package until the last file of it is no longer used
              within that distribution.
              <b>minimal</b> Remove files no longer included in the tracked distribution.  (Remove  changes,  logs  and
              includebyhand files once no file is in any part of the distribution).
              And any number of the following (or none):
              <b>includechanges</b>  Add  the  .changes file to the tracked files of a source package.  Thus it is also
              put into the pool.
              <b>includebyhand</b> Add <b>byhand</b> and <b>raw-</b><u>*</u> files to the tracked files and thus in the pool.
              <b>includebuildinfos</b> Add buildinfo files to the tracked files and thus in the pool.
              <b>includelogs</b> Add log files to the tracked files and thus in the pool.  (Not that putting log  files
              in changes files is a reprepro extension not found in normal changes files)
              <b>embargoalls</b> Not yet implemented.
              <b>keepsources</b>  Even  when using minimal mode, do not remove source files until no file is needed any
              more.
              <b>needsources</b> Not yet implemented.

       <b>Log</b>    Specify a file to log additions and removals of this distribution into and/or external scripts  to
              call  when  something  is  added  or  removed.   The  rest of the <b>Log:</b> line is the filename, every
              following line (as usual, have to begin with a single space) the name of a script  to  call.   The
              name   of   the   script   may  be  preceded  with  options  of  the  form  <b>--type=</b>(<b>dsc</b>|<b>deb</b>|<b>udeb</b>),
              <b>--architecture=</b><u>name</u>  or  <b>--component=</b><u>name</u>  to  only  call  the  script  for  some  parts  of   the
              distribution.   An  script  with argument <b>--changes</b> is called when a <b>.changes</b> file was accepted by
              <b>include</b> or <b>processincoming</b>  (and  with  other  arguments).   Both  type  of  scripts  can  have  a
              <b>--via=</b><u>command</u> specified, in which case it is only called when caused by reprepro command <u>command</u>.

              For information how it is called and some examples take a look at manual.html in reprepro's source
              or <b>/usr/share/doc/reprepro/</b>

              If  the  filename  for  the log files does not start with a slash, it is relative to the directory
              specified with <b>--logdir</b>, the scripts are relative to <b>--confdir</b> unless starting with <b>~/</b>,  <b>+b/</b>,  <b>+c/</b>
              or <b>/</b>.

       <b>ValidFor</b>
              If  this  field  exists,  an  Valid-Until  field  is  put  into  generated  <b>Release</b> files for this
              distribution with an date as much in the future as the argument specifies.

              The argument has to be an number followed by one of the units <b>d</b>, <b>m</b> or <b>y</b>, where  <b>d</b>  means  days,  <b>m</b>
              means  31 days and <b>y</b> means 365 days.  So <b>ValidFor:</b> <b>1m</b> <b>11</b> <b>d</b> causes the generation of a <b>Valid-Until:</b>
              header in Release files that points 42 days into the future.

       <b>ReadOnly</b>
              Disallow all modifications of this distribution or  its  directory  in  <b>dists/</b><u>codename</u>  (with  the
              exception of snapshot subdirectories).

       <b>ByHandHooks</b>
              This  species  hooks  to  call  for  handling  byhand/raw  files by processincoming (and in future
              versions perhaps by include).

              Each line consists out of 4 arguments: A glob pattern for the section (clasically  <b>byhand</b>,  though
              Ubuntu uses <b>raw-</b>*), a glob pattern for the priority (not usually used), and a glob pattern for the
              filename.

              The 4th argument is the script to be called when all of the above match.  It gets 5 arguments: the
              codename  of  the  distribution,  the section (usually <b>byhand</b>), the priority (usually only <b>-</b>), the
              filename in the changes file and the full filename (with processincoming in the secure TempDir).

       <b>Signed-By</b>
              This optional field is simply copied into the Release files.  It is used to tell apt which keys to
              trust for this Release in the future.  (see SignWith for how to tell reprepro whether and  how  to
              sign).

   <b>conf/updates</b>
       <b>Name</b>   The name of this update-upstream as it can be used in the <b>Update</b> field in conf/distributions.

       <b>Method</b> An  URI  as one could also give it apt, e.g.  <u><a href="http://ftp.debian.de/debian">http://ftp.debian.de/debian</a></u> which is simply given to
              the corresponding <b>apt-get</b> method. (So either <b>apt-get</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>installed,</b> <b>or</b>  <b>you</b>  <b>have</b>  <b>to</b>  <b>point</b>
              <b>with</b> <b>--methoddir</b> to a place where such methods are found.

       <b>Fallback</b>
              (Still  experimental:)  A  fallback URI, where all files are tried that failed the first one. They
              are given to the same method as the previous URI (e.g. both http://), and the fallback-server must
              have everything at the same place.  No recalculation is done, but single files  are  just  retried
              from this location.

       <b>Config</b> This  can contain any number of lines, each in the format <b>apt-get</b> <b>--option</b> would expect. (Multiple
              lines ‐ as always ‐ marked with leading spaces).

       For example: Config: Acquire::Http::Proxy=<a href="http://proxy.yours.org">http://proxy.yours.org</a>:8080

       <b>From</b>   The name of another update rule this rules derives from.  The rule containing  the  <b>From</b>  may  not
              contain  <b>Method</b>,  <b>Fallback</b> or <b>Config</b>.  All other fields are used from the rule referenced in <b>From</b>,
              unless found in this containing the <b>From</b>.  The rule referenced in <b>From</b> may itself contain a  <b>From</b>.
              Reprepro  will  only  assume  two  remote  index  files  are  the  same,  if both get their <b>Method</b>
              information from the same rule.

       <b>Suite</b>  The suite to update from. If this is not present, the codename of the distribution using this  one
              is used. Also "*/whatever" is replaced by "&lt;codename&gt;/whatever"

       <b>Components</b>
              The  components to update. Each item can be either the name of a component or a pair of a upstream
              component and a local component separated with "&gt;". (e.g. "main&gt;all contrib&gt;all non-free&gt;notall")

              If this field is not there, all components from the distribution to update are tried.

              An empty field means no source or .deb packages are updated by this rule, but only .udeb packages,
              if there are any.

              A rule might list components not available in all distributions using  this  rule.  In  this  case
              unknown  components  are  silently ignored.  (Unless you start reprepro with the <b>--fast</b> option, it
              will warn about components unusable in all distributions using that rule. As exceptions,  unusable
              components  called  <b>none</b>  are  never  warned about, for compatibility with versions prior to 3.0.0
              where and empty field had a different meaning.)

       <b>Architectures</b>
              The architectures to update. If omitted all  from  the  distribution  to  update  from.  (As  with
              components, you can use "&gt;" to download from one architecture and add into another one. (This only
              determine  in  which  Package  list  they land, it neither overwrites the Architecture line in its
              description, nor the one in the filename determined from this one. In other words, it is no really
              useful without additional filtering))

       <b>UDebComponents</b>
              Like <b>Components</b> but for the udebs.

       <b>VerifyRelease</b>
              Download the <b>Release.gpg</b> file and check if it is a signature of the <b>Releasefile</b> with the key given
              here. (In the Format as "gpg --with-colons --list-key" prints it, i.e. the last 16 hex  digits  of
              the fingerprint) Multiple keys can be specified by separating them with a "<b>|</b>" sign. Then finding a
              signature from one of the will suffice.  To allow revoked or expired keys, add a "<b>!</b>" behind a key.
              (but  to  accept such signatures, the appropriate <b>--ignore</b> is also needed).  To also allow subkeys
              of a specified key, add a "<b>+</b>" behind a key.

       <b>IgnoreRelease:</b> <b>yes</b>
              If this is present, no <b>InRelease</b> or <b>Release</b> file will be downloaded and thus the  md5sums  of  the
              other index files will not be checked.

       <b>GetInRelease:</b> <b>no</b>
              IF this is present, no <b>InRelease</b> file is downloaded but only <b>Release</b> (and <b>Release.gpg</b> ) are tried.

       <b>Flat</b>   If  this  field  is  in  an update rule, it is supposed to be a flat repository, i.e. a repository
              without a <b>dists</b> dir and no subdirectories for the index files.  (If the corresponding <b>sources.list</b>
              line has the suite end with a slash, then you might need this one.)  The argument  for  the  <b>Flat:</b>
              field  is  the  Component  to put those packages into.  No <b>Components</b> or <b>UDebComponents</b> fields are
              allowed in a flat update rule.  If the <b>Architecture</b> field has any <b>&gt;</b> items, the part  left  of  the
              "<b>&gt;</b>" is ignored.
              For example the <b>sources.list</b> line
               deb <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/debian">http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/debian</a> etch-cran/
              would translate to
               Name: R
               Method: <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/debian">http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/debian</a>
               Suite: etch-cran
               Flat: whatevercomponentyoudlikethepackagesin

       <b>IgnoreHashes</b>
              This  directive  tells reprepro to not check the listed hashes in the downloaded Release file (and
              only in the Release file).  Possible values are currently <b>md5</b>, <b>sha1</b> and <b>sha256</b>.

              Note that this does not speed anything up in any measurable way. The only reason to  specify  this
              if  the  Release  file  of  the  distribution  you  want  to  mirror  from uses a faulty algorithm
              implementation.  Otherwise you will gain nothing and only lose security.

       <b>FilterFormula</b>
              This can be a formula to specify which packages to accept from this source. The format is misusing
              the parser intended for Dependency lines. To get only architecture all packages use  "architecture
              (==  all)",  to  get  only  at  least  important  packages  use  "priority (==required) | priority
              (==important)".

              See the description of the listfilter command for the semantics of formulas.

       <b>FilterList</b>, <b>FilterSrcList</b>
              These two options each take at least two arguments: The first argument is the  fallback  (default)
              action.  All following arguments are treated as file names of lists.

              The filenames are considered to be relative to <b>--confdir</b>, if not starting with <b>~/</b>, <b>+b/</b>, <b>+c/</b> or <b>/</b>.

              Each  list  file  consists  of  lines  with  a package name followed by whitespaced followed by an
              action.

              Each list may only contain a single line for a given package name.  The action to be taken is  the
              action  specified  by the first file mentioning that package.  If no list file mentions a package,
              the fallback action is used instead.

              This format is inspired by dpkg --get-selections before multiarch and the  names  of  the  actions
              likely  only  make  sense  if you imagine the file to be the output of this command of an existing
              system.

              For each package available in the distribution to be  updated  from/pulled  from  this  action  is
              determined  and  affects  the current decision what to do to the target distribution.  (Only after
              all update/pull rules for a given target distribution have been processed  something  is  actually
              done).

              The possible action keywords are:

              <b>install</b>
                     mark  the  available package to be added to the target distribution unless the same version
                     or a higher version is already marked as to be added/kept.   (Note  that  without  a  prior
                     delete  rule  (<b>-</b>)  or  <b>supersede</b> action, this will never downgrade a package as the already
                     existing version is marked to be kept).

              <b>upgradeonly</b>
                     like <b>install</b> but will not add new packages to a distribution.

              <b>supersede</b>
                     unless the current package version is higher than the available package version,  mark  the
                     package  to  be  deleted  in the target distribution.  (Useful to remove packages in add-on
                     distributions once they reached the base distribution).

              <b>deinstall</b> or <b>purge</b>
                     ignore the newly available package.

              <b>warning</b>
                     print a warning message to stderr if a new package/newer version is  available.   Otherwise
                     ignore the new package (like with <b>deinstall</b> or <b>purge</b>).

              <b>hold</b>   the  new package is ignored, but every previous decision to downgrade or delete the package
                     in the target distribution is reset.

              <b>error</b>  abort the whole upgrade/pull if a new package/newer version is available

              <b>=</b> <u>version</u>
                     If the candidate package has the given version, behave like <b>install</b>.  Otherwise continue as
                     if this list file did not mention this package (i.e. look in the remaining  list  files  or
                     use  the  fallback action).  Only one such entry per package is currently supported and the
                     version is currently compared as string.

              If there is both <b>FilterList</b> and <b>FilterSrcList</b> then the first is used for <b>.deb</b> and  <b>.udeb</b>  and  the
              second for <b>.dsc</b> packages.

              If there is only <b>FilterList</b> that is applied to everything.

              If  there  is  only  <b>FilterSrcList</b> that is applied to everything, too, but the source package name
              (and source version) is used to do the lookup.

       <b>OmitExtraSourceOnly</b>
              This field controls whether source packages with Extra-Source-Only set  are  ignore  when  getting
              source  packages.   Without this option or if it is true, those source packages are ignored, while
              if set to no or false, those source packages are also condidates if no other filter excludes them.
              (The default of true will likely change once reprepro supports multiple versions of a  package  or
              has other means to keep the source packages around).

       <b>ListHook</b>
              If  this is given, it is executed for all downloaded index files with the downloaded list as first
              and a filename that will be used instead  of  this.  (e.g.  "ListHook:  <a href="file:/bin/cp">/bin/cp</a>"  works  but  does
              nothing.)

              If  a  file  will  be  read  multiple  times, it is processed multiple times, with the environment
              variables  <b>REPREPRO_FILTER_CODENAME</b>,  <b>REPREPRO_FILTER_PACKAGETYPE</b>,  <b>REPREPRO_FILTER_COMPONENT</b>  and
              <b>REPREPRO_FILTER_ARCHITECTURE</b>  set to the where this file will be added and <b>REPREPRO_FILTER_PATTERN</b>
              to the name of the update rule causing it.

       <b>ListShellHook</b>
              This is like ListHook, but the whole argument is given to the shell as argument, and the input and
              output file are stdin and stdout.

              i.e.:
              ListShellHook: cat
              works but does nothing but useless use of a shell and cat, while
              ListShellHook: grep-dctrl -X -S apt -o -X -S dpkg || [ $? -eq 1 ]
              will limit the update rule to packages from the specified source packages.

       <b>DownloadListsAs</b>
              The arguments of this field specify which index files reprepro will download.

              Allowed values are <b>.</b>, <b>.gz</b>, <b>.bz2</b>, <b>.lzma</b>, <b>.xz</b>, <b>.diff</b>, <b>force.gz</b>, <b>force.bz2</b>, <b>force.lzma</b>, <b>force.xz</b>, and
              <b>force.diff</b>.

              Reprepro will try the first supported variant in the list given: Only compressions compiled in  or
              for  which  an  uncompressor  was found are used.  Unless the value starts with <b>force.</b>, it is only
              tried if is found in the Release or InRelease file.

              The default value is <b>.diff</b> <b>.xz</b> <b>.lzma</b> <b>.bz2</b> <b>.gz</b> <b>.</b>, i.e.  download Packages.diff  if  listed  in  the
              Release file, otherwise or if not usable download .xz if listed in the Release file and there is a
              way to uncompress it, then .lzma if usable, then .bz2 if usable, then .gz and then uncompressed).

              Note  there  is  no way to see if an uncompressed variant of the file is available (as the Release
              file always lists their checksums, even if not there), so putting '<b>.</b>' anywhere  but  as  the  last
              argument can mean trying to download a file that does not exist.

              Together  with  <b>IgnoreRelease</b> reprepro will download the first in this list that could be unpacked
              (i.e. <b>force</b> is always assumed) and the default value is <b>.gz</b> <b>.bzip2</b> <b>.</b> <b>.lzma</b> <b>.xz</b>.

   <b>conf/pulls</b>
       This file contains the rules for pulling packages from one distribution to another.  While this can  also
       be  done  with  update  rules  using the file or copy method and using the exported indices of that other
       distribution, this way is faster.  It also ensures the current files are used and  no  copies  are  made.
       (This also leads to the limitation that pulling from one component to another is not possible.)

       Each rule consists out of the following fields:

       <b>Name</b>   The name of this pull rule as it can be used in the <b>Pull</b> field in conf/distributions.

       <b>From</b>   The codename of the distribution to pull packages from.

       <b>Components</b>
              The components of the distribution to get from.

              If this field is not there, all components from the distribution to  update are tried.

              A  rule  might  list  components  not available in all distributions using this rule. In this case
              unknown components are silently ignored.  (Unless you start reprepro with the  --fast  option,  it
              will  warn about components unusable in all distributions using that rule.  As exception, unusable
              components called <b>none</b> are never warned about, for compatibility  with  versions  prior  to  3.0.0
              where and empty field had a different meaning.)

       <b>Architectures</b>
              The  architectures  to  update.   If  omitted  all  from  the  distribution  to  pull from.  As in
              <b>conf/updates</b>, you can use "&gt;" to download from one architecture and add  into  another  one.  (And
              again, only useful with filtering to avoid packages not architecture <b>all</b> to migrate).

       <b>UDebComponents</b>
              Like <b>Components</b> but for the udebs.

       <b>FilterFormula</b>

       <b>FilterList</b>

       <b>FilterSrcList</b>
              The same as with update rules.

</pre><h4><b>OVERRIDE</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The  format  of  override  files  used by reprepro should resemble the extended ftp-archive format, to be
       specific it is:

       <u>packagename</u> <u>field</u> <u>name</u> <u>new</u> <u>value</u>

       For example:
       <b>kernel-image-2.4.31-yourorga</b> <b>Section</b> <b>protected/base</b>
       <b>kernel-image-2.4.31-yourorga</b> <b>Priority</b> <b>standard</b>
       <b>kernel-image-2.4.31-yourorga</b> <b>Maintainer</b> <b>That's</b> <b>me</b> <b>&lt;me@localhost&gt;</b>
       <b>reprepro</b> <b>Priority</b> <b>required</b>

       All fields of a given package will be replaced by the new value specified in the override file  with  the
       exception  of  special  fields  starting  with a dollar sign ($).  While the field name is compared case-
       insensitive, it is copied in exactly the form in the override file there.  (Thus I suggest to keep to the
       exact case it is normally found in index files in case some other tool confuses them.)  More than  copied
       is  the  Section  header (unless <b>-S</b> is supplied), which is also used to guess the component (unless <b>-C</b> is
       there).

       Some values like <b>Package</b>, <b>Filename</b>, <b>Size</b> or <b>MD5sum</b> are forbidden, as their usage would  severely  confuse
       reprepro.

       As  an  extension  reprepro also supports patterns instead of packagenames.  If the package name contains
       '*', '[' or '?', it is considered a pattern and applied to each package that is not matched by  any  non-
       pattern override nor by any previous pattern.

       Fieldnames  starting  with  a  dollar ($) are not be placed in the exported control data but have special
       meaning.  Unknown ones are loudly ignored.  Special fields are:

        <b>$Component</b>: includedeb, includedsc, include and processincoming will put the package  in  the  component
       given  as value (unless itself overridden with <b>-C</b>).  Note that the proper way to specify the component is
       by setting the section field and using this extension will most likely confuse people and/or tools.

        <b>$Delete</b>: the value is treated a fieldname and fields of that name are removed.  (This way one can remove
       fields previously added without removing and readding the package.  And fields already  included  in  the
       package can be removed, too).

   <b>conf/incoming</b>
       Every chunk is a rule set for the <b>process_incoming</b> command.  Possible fields are:

       <b>Name</b>   The name of the rule-set, used as argument to the scan command to specify to use this rule.

       <b>IncomingDir</b>
              The Name of the directory to scan for <b>.changes</b> files.

       <b>TempDir</b>
              A directory where the files listed in the processed .changes files are copied into before they are
              read.   You  can  avoid some copy operations by placing this directory within the same moint point
              the pool hierarchy is (at least partially) in.

       <b>LogDir</b> A directory where .changes files, .log files, .buildinfo files and otherwise unused .byhand  files
              are stored upon procession.

       <b>Allow</b>  Each  argument  is  either  a  pair <u>name1</u><b>&gt;</b><u>name2</u> or simply <u>name</u> which is short for <u>name</u><b>&gt;</b><u>name</u>.  Each
              <u>name2</u> must identify a distribution, either  by  being  Codename,  a  unique  Suite,  or  a  unique
              AlsoAcceptFor  from  <b>conf/distributions</b>.   Each  upload  has each item in its <b>Distribution:</b> header
              compared first to last with each <u>name1</u> in the rules and is put in the  first  one  accepting  this
              package.  e.g.:
              Allow: local unstable&gt;sid
              or
              Allow: stable&gt;security-updates stable&gt;proposed-updates
              (Note that this makes only sense if Multiple is set to true or if there are people only allowed to
              upload to proposed-updates but not to security-updates).

       <b>Default</b> <u>distribution</u>
              Every  upload  not  put  into  any  other  distribution  because  of an Allow argument is put into
              <u>distribution</u> if that accepts it.

       <b>Multiple</b>
              Old form of Options: multiple_distributions.

       <b>Options</b>
              A list of options
              <b>multiple_distributions</b>
              Allow including a upload in multiple distributions.

              If a .changes file lists multiple distributions, then reprepro will  start  with  the  first  name
              given, check all Accept and Default options till it finds a distribution this upload can go into.

              If this found no distribution or if this option was given, reprepro will then do the same with the
              second distribution name given in the .changes file and so on.
              <b>limit_arch_all</b>
              If  an  upload  contains  binaries  from  some  architecture  and  architecture  all packages, the
              architecture all packages are only put into the  architectures  within  this  upload.   Useful  to
              combine with the <b>flood</b> command.

       <b>Permit</b> A list of options to allow things otherwise causing errors:
              <b>unused_files</b>
              Do  not  stop  with  error  if  there  are files listed in the <b>.changes</b> file if it lists files not
              belonging to any package in it.
              <b>older_version</b>
              Ignore a package not added because there already is a strictly newer version available instead  of
              treating this as an error.
              <b>unlisted_binaries</b>
              Do  not  abort  with  an  error  if a .changes file contains .deb files that are not listed in the
              Binaries header.

       <b>Cleanup</b> <u>options</u>
              A list of options to cause more files in the incoming directory to be deleted:
              <b>unused_files</b>
              If there is <b>unused_files</b> in <b>Permit</b> then also delete those files when the package is deleted  after
              successful processing.
              <b>unused_buildinfo_files</b>
              If  .buildinfo  files  of processed .changes files are not used (neither stored by LogDir nor with
              Tracking: includebuildinfos) then delete  them  from  the  incoming  dir.   (This  option  has  no
              additional effect if <b>unused_files</b> is already used.)
              <b>on_deny</b>
              If  a <b>.changes</b> file is denied processing because of missing signatures or allowed distributions to
              be put in, delete it and all the files it references.
              <b>on_error</b>
              If a <b>.changes</b> file causes errors while processing, delete it and the files it references.

              Note that allowing cleanup in publically accessible incoming queues allows a denial of service  by
              sending in .changes files deleting other peoples files before they are completed.  Especially when
              .changes files are handled directly (e.g. by inoticoming).

       <b>MorgueDir</b>
              If  files  are to be deleted by Cleanup, they are instead moved to a subdirectory of the directory
              given as value to this field.  This directory has to be on the  same  partition  as  the  incoming
              directory and files are moved (i.e. owner and permission stay the same) and never copied.

</pre><h4><b>UPLOADERS</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       These  files specified by the <b>Uploaders</b> header in the distribution definition as explained above describe
       what key a <b>.changes</b> file as to be signed with to be included in that distribution.

       Empty lines and lines starting with a hash are ignored, every other line must be of one of the  following
       nine forms or an include directive:

       <b>allow</b> <u>condition</u> <b>by</b> <b>anybody</b>
              which allows everyone to upload packages matching <u>condition</u>,

       <b>allow</b> <u>condition</u> <b>by</b> <b>unsigned</b>
              which allows everything matching that has no pgp/gpg header,

       <b>allow</b> <u>condition</u> <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>key</b>
              which allows everything matching with any valid signature in or

       <b>allow</b> <u>condition</u> <b>by</b> <b>key</b> <u>key-id</u>
              which  allows  everything matching signed by this <u>key-id</u> (to be specified without any spaces).  If
              the <u>key-id</u> ends with a <b>+</b> (plus), a signature with a subkey of this primary key also suffices.

              <u>key-id</u> must be a suffix of the id libgpgme uses to identify this key, i.e. a number  of  hexdigits
              from  the  end  of  the fingerprint of the key, but no more than what libgpgme uses.  (The maximal
              number should be what gpg --list-key --with-colons prints, as of the time of this writing that  is
              at most 16 hex-digits).

       <b>allow</b> <u>condition</u> <b>by</b> <b>group</b> <u>groupname</u>
              which allows every member of group <u>groupname</u>.  Groups can be manipulated by

       <b>group</b> <u>groupname</u> <b>add</b> <u>key-id</u>
              to add a <u>key-id</u> (see above for details) to this group, or

       <b>group</b> <u>groupname</u> <b>contains</b> <u>groupname</u>
              to add a whole group to a group.

              To avoid warnings in incomplete config files there is also

       <b>group</b> <u>groupname</u> <b>empty</b>
              to declare a group has no members (avoids warnings that it is used without those) and

       <b>group</b> <u>groupname</u> <b>unused</b>
              to declare that a group is not yet used (avoid warnings that it is not used).

       A  line  starting with <b>include</b> causes the rest of the line to be interpreted as filename, which is opened
       and processed before the rest of the file is processed.

       The only conditions currently supported are:

       <b>*</b>      which means any package,

       <b>source</b> <b>'</b><u>name</u><b>'</b>
              which means any package with  source  <u>name</u>.   ('<b>*</b>',  '<b>?</b>'  and  '<b>[</b>..<b>]</b>'  are  treated  as  in  shell
              wildcards).

       <b>sections</b> <b>'</b><u>name</u><b>'</b>(<b>|'</b><u>name</u><b>'</b>)*
              matches  an upload in which each section matches one of the names given.  As upload conditions are
              checked very early, this is the section listed in the .changes file, not the one from the override
              file.  (But this might change in the future, if you have  the  need  for  the  one  or  the  other
              behavior, let me know).

       <b>sections</b> <b>contain</b> <b>'</b><u>name</u><b>'</b>(<b>|'</b><u>name</u><b>'</b>)*
              The  same,  but  not  all  sections  must be from the given set, but at least one source or binary
              package needs to have one of those given.

       <b>binaries</b> <b>'</b><u>name</u><b>'</b>(<b>|'</b><u>name</u><b>'</b>)*
              matches an upload in which each binary (type deb or udeb) matches one of the names given.

       <b>binaries</b> <b>contain</b> <b>'</b><u>name</u><b>'</b>(<b>|'</b><u>name</u><b>'</b>)*
              again only at least one instead of all is required.

       <b>architectures</b> <b>'</b><u>architecture</u><b>'</b>(<b>|'</b><u>name</u><b>'</b>)*
              matches an upload in which each package has only architectures from the given set.  <b>source</b> and <b>all</b>
              are treated as unique architectures.  Wildcards are not allowed.

       <b>architectures</b> <b>contain</b> <b>'</b><u>architecture</u><b>'</b>(<b>|'</b><u>architecture</u><b>'</b>)*
              again only at least one instead of all is required.

       <b>byhand</b> matches  an  upload  with  at  least  one  byhand  file  (i.e.  a  file  with  section  <b>byhand</b>  or
              <b>raw-</b><u>something</u>).

       <b>byhand</b> <b>'</b><u>section</u><b>'</b>(<b>|'</b><u>section</u><b>'</b>)*
              matches  an  upload  with at least one byhand file and all byhand files having a section listed in
              the list of given section.  (i.e. <b>byhand</b> <b>'byhand'|'raw-*'</b> is currently is the same as <b>byhand</b>).

       <b>distribution</b> <b>'</b><u>codename</u><b>'</b>
              which means any package when it is to be included in <u>codename</u>.  As the uploaders file is given  by
              distribution, this is only useful to reuse a complex uploaders file for multiple distributions.

       Putting <b>not</b> in front of a condition, inverses it's meaning.  For example
       <b>allow</b> <b>not</b> <b>source</b> <b>'r*'</b> <b>by</b> <b>anybody</b>
       means anybody may upload packages which source name does not start with an 'r'.

       Multiple  conditions  can  be  connected  with <b>and</b> and <b>or</b>, with <b>or</b> binding stronger (but both weaker than
       <b>not</b>).  That means
       <b>allow</b> <b>source</b> <b>'r*'</b> <b>and</b> <b>source</b> <b>'*xxx'</b> <b>or</b> <b>source</b> <b>'*o'</b> <b>by</b> <b>anybody</b>
       is equivalent to
       <b>allow</b> <b>source</b> <b>'r*xxx'</b> <b>by</b> <b>anybody</b>
       <b>allow</b> <b>source</b> <b>'r*o'</b> <b>by</b> <b>anybody</b>

       (Other conditions will follow once somebody tells me what restrictions are useful.  Currently planned  is
       only something for architectures).

</pre><h4><b>ERROR</b> <b>IGNORING</b></h4><pre>
       With <b>--ignore</b> on the command line or an <u>ignore</u> line in the options file, the following type of errors can
       be ignored:

       <b>brokenold</b> (hopefully never seen)
              If  there  are  errors parsing an installed version of package, do not error out, but assume it is
              older than anything else, has not files or no source name.

       <b>brokensignatures</b>
              If a .changes or .dsc file contains at least one invalid signature and  no  valid  signature  (not
              even  expired  or  from  an  expired  or revoked key), reprepro assumes the file got corrupted and
              refuses to use it unless this ignore directive is given.

       <b>brokenversioncmp</b> (hopefully never seen)
              If comparing old and new version fails, assume the new one is newer.

       <b>dscinbinnmu</b>
              If a .changes file has an explicit Source version that is different the to the version  header  of
              the  file,  than  reprepro assumes it is binary non maintainer upload (NMU).  In that case, source
              files are not permitted in  .changes  files  processed  by  <b>include</b>  or  <b>processincoming</b>.   Adding
              <b>--ignore=dscinbinnmu</b> allows it for the <b>include</b> command.

       <b>emptyfilenamepart</b> (insecure)
              Allow  strings  to  be empty that are used to construct filenames.  (like versions, architectures,
              ...)

       <b>extension</b>
              Allow one to <b>includedeb</b> files that do not end with <b>.deb</b>, to <b>includedsc</b> files not  ending  in  <b>.dsc</b>
              and to <b>include</b> files not ending in <b>.changes</b>.

       <b>forbiddenchar</b> (insecure)
              Do not insist on Debian policy for package and source names and versions.  Thus allowing all 7-bit
              characters  but  slashes  (as  they  would break the file storage) and things syntactically active
              (spaces, underscores in filenames in .changes files, opening parentheses in source names of binary
              packages).  To allow some 8-bit chars additionally, use <b>8bit</b> additionally.

       <b>8bit</b> (more insecure)
              Allow 8-bit characters not looking like overlong UTF-8 sequences in filenames and things  used  as
              parts  of  filenames.   Though it hopefully rejects overlong UTF-8 sequences, there might be other
              characters your filesystem confuses with special  characters,  thus  creating  filenames  possibly
              equivalent  to  <b>/mirror/pool/main/../../../etc/shadow</b>  (Which  should  be  safe, as you do not run
              reprepro as root, do you?)   or  simply  overwriting  your  conf/distributions  file  adding  some
              commands  in there. So do not use this if you are paranoid, unless you are paranoid enough to have
              checked the code of your libs, kernel and filesystems.

       <b>ignore</b> (for forward compatibility)
              Ignore unknown ignore types given to <u>--ignore</u>.

       <b>flatandnonflat</b> (only suppresses a warning)
              Do not warn about a flat and a non-flat distribution from the same source with the same name  when
              updating.  (Hopefully never ever needed.)

       <b>malformedchunk</b> (I hope you know what you do)
              Do  not  stop  when  finding  a  line  not  starting with a space but no colon(:) in it. These are
              otherwise rejected as they have no defined meaning.

       <b>missingfield</b> (safe to ignore)
              Ignore missing fields in a .changes file that are only checked but not processed.  Those  include:
              Format, Date, Urgency, Maintainer, Description, Changes

       <b>missingfile</b> (might be insecure)
              When  including  a  .dsc  file from a .changes file, try to get files needed but not listed in the
              .changes file (e.g. when someone forgot to specify -sa to dpkg-buildpackage)  from  the  directory
              the  .changes  file  is  in  instead  of  erroring out.  (<b>--delete</b> will not work with those files,
              though.)

       <b>spaceonlyline</b> (I hope you know what you do)
              Allow lines containing only (but non-zero) spaces. As these do not separate chunks  as  thus  will
              cause reprepro to behave unexpected, they cause error messages by default.

       <b>surprisingarch</b>
              Do  not reject a .changes file containing files for a architecture not listed in the Architecture-
              header within it.

       <b>surprisingbinary</b>
              Do not reject a .changes file containing .deb files containing packages whose name is  not  listed
              in the "Binary:" header of that changes file.

       <b>undefinedtarget</b> (hope you are not using the wrong db directory)
              Do      not      stop     when     the     packages.db     file     contains     databases     for
              codename/packagetype/component/architectures  combinations   that   are   not   listed   in   your
              distributions file.

              This  allows  you to temporarily remove some distribution from the config files, without having to
              remove the packages in it with the <b>clearvanished</b>  command.   You  might  even  temporarily  remove
              single architectures or components, though that might cause inconsistencies in some situations.

       <b>undefinedtracking</b> (hope you are not using the wrong db directory)
              Do  not  stop  when  the tracking file contains databases for distributions that are not listed in
              your <b>distributions</b> file.

              This allows you to temporarily remove some distribution from the config files, without  having  to
              remove  the  packages  in  it  with the <b>clearvanished</b> command.  You might even temporarily disable
              tracking in some distribution, but that is likely to cause inconsistencies in there, if you do not
              know, what you are doing.

       <b>unknownfield</b> (for forward compatibility)
              Ignore unknown fields in the config files, instead of refusing to run then.

       <b>unusedarch</b> (safe to ignore)
              No longer reject a .changes file containing no files for any of the architectures  listed  in  the
              Architecture-header within it.

       <b>unusedoption</b>
              Do not complain about command line options not used by the specified action (like <b>--architecture</b>).

       <b>uploaders</b>
              The include command will accept packages that would otherwise been rejected by the uploaders file.

       <b>wrongarchitecture</b> (safe to ignore)
              Do  not  warn  about  wrong  "Architecture:" lines in downloaded Packages files.  (Note that wrong
              Architectures are always ignored when getting stuff from flat repostories or importing stuff  from
              one architecture to another).

       <b>wrongdistribution</b> (safe to ignore)
              Do  not  error  out if a .changes file is to be placed in a distribution not listed in that files'
              Distributions: header.

       <b>wrongsourceversion</b>
              Do not reject a .changes file containing .deb files with a different opinion on what  the  version
              of the source package is.
              (Note: reprepro only compares literally here, not by meaning.)

       <b>wrongversion</b>
              Do not reject a .changes file containing .dsc files with a different version.
              (Note: reprepro only compares literally here, not by meaning.)

       <b>expiredkey</b> (I hope you know what you do)
              Accept signatures with expired keys.  (Only if the expired key is explicitly requested).

       <b>expiredsignature</b> (I hope you know what you do)
              Accept expired signatures with expired keys.  (Only if the key is explicitly requested).

       <b>revokedkey</b> (I hope you know what you do)
              Accept signatures with revoked keys.  (Only if the revoked key is explicitly requested).

</pre><h4><b>GUESSING</b></h4><pre>
       When  including  a binary or source package without explicitly declaring a component with <b>-C</b> it will take
       the first component with the name of the section, being prefix  to  the  section,  being  suffix  to  the
       section or having the section as prefix or any. (In this order)

       Thus  having specified the components: "main non-free contrib non-US/main non-US/non-free non-US/contrib"
       should map e.g.  "non-US" to "non-US/main" and "contrib/editors" to "contrib", while  having  only  "main
       non-free and contrib" as components should map "non-US/contrib" to "contrib" and "non-US" to "main".

       <b>NOTE:</b> Always specify main as the first component, if you want things to end up there.

       <b>NOTE:</b> unlike in dak, non-US and non-us are different things...

</pre><h4><b>NOMENCLATURE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Codename</b>  the  primary  identifier  of a given distribution. This are normally things like <b>sarge</b>, <b>etch</b> or
       <b>sid</b>.

       <b>basename</b>
              the name of a file without any directory information.

       <b>byhand</b> Changes files can have files with section 'byhand' (Debian) or 'raw-' (Ubuntu).  Those  files  are
              not  packages but other data generated (usually together with packages) and then uploaded together
              with this changes files.

              With reprepro those can be stored in the pool next to their packages with tracking,  put  in  some
              log directory when using processincoming, or given to an hook script (currently only possible with
              processincoming).

       <b>filekey</b>
              the position relative to the outdir.  (as found in "Filename:" in Packages.gz)

       <b>full</b> <b>filename</b>
              the position relative to /

       <b>architecture</b>
              The  term like <b>sparc</b>, <b>i386</b>, <b>mips</b>, ... .  To refer to the source packages, <b>source</b> is sometimes also
              treated as architecture.

       <b>component</b>
              Things like <b>main</b>, <b>non-free</b> and <b>contrib</b> (by policy and some other  programs  also  called  section,
              reprepro follows the naming scheme of apt here.)

       <b>section</b>
              Things  like <b>base</b>, <b>interpreters</b>, <b>oldlibs</b> and <b>non-free/math</b> (by policy and some other programs also
              called subsections).

       <b>md5sum</b> The checksum of a file in the format "<u>&lt;md5sum</u> <u>of</u> <u>file&gt;</u> <u>&lt;length</u> <u>of</u> <u>file&gt;</u>"

</pre><h4><b>Some</b> <b>note</b> <b>on</b> <b>updates</b></h4><pre>
   <b>A</b> <b>version</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>overwritten</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>version.</b>
       <b>reprepro</b> will never update a package with  a  version  it  already  has.  This  would  be  equivalent  to
       rebuilding the whole database with every single upgrade.  To force the new same version in, remove it and
       then  update.   (If  files  of the packages changed without changing their name, make sure the file is no
       longer remembered by reprepro.  Without <b>--keepunreferencedfiled</b> and  without  errors  while  deleting  it
       should already be forgotten, otherwise a <b>deleteunreferenced</b> or even some <b>__forget</b> might help.)

   <b>The</b> <b>magic</b> <b>delete</b> <b>rule</b> <b>("-").</b>
       A  minus  as a single word in the <b>Update:</b> line of a distribution marks everything to be deleted. The mark
       causes later rules to get packages even if they have (strict) lower versions. The mark will  get  removed
       if a later rule sets the package on hold (hold is not yet implemented, in case you might wonder) or would
       get a package with the same version (Which it will not, see above). If the mark is still there at the end
       of the processing, the package will get removed.

       Thus  the  line  "Update:  -  <u>rules</u>  " will cause all packages to be exactly the highest Version found in
       <u>rules.</u>  The line "Update: <u>near</u> - <u>rules</u> " will do the same, except if it needs to  download  packages,  it
       might  download  it from <u>near</u> except when too confused. (It will get too confused e.g. when <u>near</u> or <u>rules</u>
       have multiple versions of the package and the highest in <u>near</u> is not the first one in <u>rules,</u> as it  never
       remember more than one possible spring for a package.

       Warning:  This rule applies to all type/component/architecture triplets of a distribution, not only those
       some other update rule applies to.  (That means it will delete everything in those!)

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Environment variables are always overwritten by command line options, but overwrite options  set  in  the
       <b>options</b>  file.  (Even  when  the  options file is obviously parsed after the environment variables as the
       environment may determine the place of the options file).

       <b>REPREPRO_BASE_DIR</b>
              The directory in this variable is used instead of the current directory, if  no  <b>-b</b>  or  <b>--basedir</b>
              options are supplied.
              It  is  also  set  in  all  hook  scripts called by reprepro (relative to the current directory or
              absolute, depending on how reprepro got it).

       <b>REPREPRO_CONFIG_DIR</b>
              The directory in this variable is used when no <b>--confdir</b> is supplied.
              It is also set in all hook scripts called by  reprepro  (relative  to  the  current  directory  or
              absolute, depending on how reprepro got it).

       <b>REPREPRO_OUT_DIR</b>
              This  is  not  used, but only set in hook scripts called by reprepro to the directory in which the
              <b>pool</b> subdirectory resides (relative to  the  current  directory  or  absolute,  depending  on  how
              reprepro got it).

       <b>REPREPRO_DIST_DIR</b>
              This is not used, but only set in hook scripts called by reprepro to the <b>dists</b> directory (relative
              to the current directory or absolute, depending on how reprepro got it).

       <b>REPREPRO_LOG_DIR</b>
              This  is  not  used,  but  only  set  in  hook  scripts called by reprepro to the value setable by
              <b>--logdir</b>.

       <b>REPREPRO_CAUSING_COMMAND</b>

       <b>REPREPRO_CAUSING_FILE</b>
              Those two environment variable are set (or unset) in <b>Log:</b> and <b>ByHandHooks:</b> scripts and  hint  what
              command and what file caused the hook to be called (if there is some).

       <b>REPREPRO_CAUSING_RULE</b>
              This  environment  variable  is  set  (or unset) in <b>Log:</b> scripts and hint what update or pull rule
              caused this change.

       <b>REPREPRO_FROM</b>
              This environment variable is set (or unset) in <b>Log:</b> scripts and denotes what other distribution  a
              package is copied from (with pull and copy commands).

       <b>REPREPRO_FILTER_ARCHITECTURE</b>

       <b>REPREPRO_FILTER_CODENAME</b>

       <b>REPREPRO_FILTER_COMPONENT</b>

       <b>REPREPRO_FILTER_PACKAGETYPE</b>

       <b>REPREPRO_FILTER_PATTERN</b>
              Set in <b>FilterList:</b> and <b>FilterSrcList:</b>  scripts.

       <b>GNUPGHOME</b>
              Not  used  by  reprepro  directly.   But  reprepro  uses libgpgme, which calls gpg for signing and
              verification of signatures.  And your gpg will most  likely  use  the  content  of  this  variable
              instead  of "<a href="file:~/.gnupg">~/.gnupg</a>".  Take a look at <b><a href="../man1/gpg.1.html">gpg</a></b>(1) to be sure.  You can also tell reprepro to set this
              with the <b>--gnupghome</b> option.

       <b>GPG_TTY</b>
              When there is a gpg-agent running that does not have the passphrase  cached  yet,  gpg  will  most
              likely  try  to start some pinentry program to get it.  If that is pinentry-curses, that is likely
              to fail without this variable, because it cannot find a terminal to ask on.   In  this  cases  you
              might  set  this  variable  to  something  like  the  value of <b>$(tty)</b> or <b>$SSH_TTY</b> or anything else
              denoting a usable terminal. (You might also want  to  make  sure  you  actually  have  a  terminal
              available.  With ssh you might need the <b>-t</b> option to get a terminal even when telling gpg to start
              a specific command).

              By  default,  reprepro will set this variable to what the symbolic link <b><a href="file:/proc/self/fd/0">/proc/self/fd/0</a></b> points to,
              if stdin is a terminal, unless you told with <b>--noguessgpgtty</b> to not do so.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Increased verbosity always shows those things  one  does  not  want  to  know.   (Though  this  might  be
       inevitable and a corollary to Murphy)

       Reprepro  uses  berkeley db, which was a big mistake.  The most annoying problem not yet worked around is
       database corruption when the disk runs out of space.  (Luckily if it happens while  downloading  packages
       while  updating,  only  the files database is affected, which is easy (though time consuming) to rebuild,
       see <b>recovery</b> file in the documentation).  Ideally put the database on another partition to avoid that.

       While the source part is mostly considered as the architecture <b>source</b> some parts may still not  use  this
       notation.

</pre><h4><b>WORK-AROUNDS</b> <b>TO</b> <b>COMMON</b> <b>PROBLEMS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gpgme</b> <b>returned</b> <b>an</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>condition</b>
              With  the  woody  version  this normally meant that there was no .gnupg directory in $HOME, but it
              created one and reprepro succeeds when called again  with  the  same  command.   Since  sarge  the
              problem  sometimes  shows  up,  too.  But it is no longer reproducible and it does not fix itself,
              neither. Try running <b>gpg</b> <b>--verify</b> <u>file-you-had-problems-with</u> manually  as  the  user  reprepro  is
              running  and  with  the  same  $HOME.  This  alone  might fix the problem. It should not print any
              messages except perhaps
              gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
              gpg: the signature could not be verified.
              if it was an unsigned file.

       <b>not</b> <b>including</b> <b>.orig.tar.gz</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>.changes</b> <b>file's</b> <b>version</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>-0</b> <b>or</b> <b>-1</b>
              If dpkg-buildpackage is run without the <b>-sa</b> option to build a version with a Debian  revision  not
              being  -0  or  -1,  it  does  not list the <b>.orig.tar.gz</b> file in the <b>.changes</b> file.  If you want to
              <b>include</b> such a file with reprepro when the .orig.tar.gz file does not already exist in  the  pool,
              reprepro will report an error.  This can be worked around by:
              call <b>dpkg-buildpackage</b> with <b>-sa</b> (recommended)
              copy the .orig.tar.gz file to the proper place in the pool before
              call reprepro with --ignore=missingfile (discouraged)

       <b>leftover</b> <b>files</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> <b>directory.</b>
              reprepro  is sometimes a bit too timid of deleting stuff. When things go wrong and there have been
              errors it sometimes just leaves everything where it is.  To see what files reprepro  remembers  to
              be in your pool directory but does not know anything needing them right know, you can use
              <b>reprepro</b> <b>dumpunreferenced</b>
              To delete them:
              <b>reprepro</b> <b>deleteunreferenced</b>

</pre><h4><b>INTERRUPTING</b></h4><pre>
       Interrupting reprepro has its problems.  Some things (like speaking with apt methods, database stuff) can
       cause  problems when interrupted at the wrong time.  Then there are design problems of the code making it
       hard to distinguish if the current state is dangerous or non-dangerous to interrupt.   Thus  if  reprepro
       receives a signal normally sent to tell a process to terminate itself softly, it continues its operation,
       but  does not start any new operations.  (I.e. it will not tell the apt-methods any new file to download,
       it will not replace a package in a target, unless it already had started with it, it will not delete  any
       files gotten dereferenced, and so on).

       <b>It</b> <b>only</b> <b>catches</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>signal</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>type.</b> <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>signal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> <b>type</b> <b>will</b> <b>terminate</b> <b>reprepro.</b>
       <b>You</b> <b>will</b> <b>risk</b> <b>database</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> <b>lockfile</b> <b>manually.</b>

       Also  note  that even normal interruption leads to code-paths mostly untested and thus expose a multitude
       of bugs including those leading to data corruption.  Better think a second more before issuing a  command
       than risking the need for interruption.
