</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       atfsrepair - repair corrupted AtFS repository, or convert old repository to new format.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>atfsrepair</b> [<b>-Ceinqv</b>] file1 ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Atfsrepair</u>  checks  the  AtFS  repository for inconsistencies in the a given file history. If a corrupted
       archive file is found in the repository, atfsrepair tries to repair it by  reconstructing  missing  parts
       and  eliminating  inconsistencies.  Without  a <u>file</u> argument, atfsrepair handles the complete repository.
       Atfsrepair is interactive and (hopefully) self explanatory.

       If you have permission problems, e.g. your AtFS repository grants group write permission but another user
       from your group can still not save data to the repository, atfsrepair is also the right thing to do.  The
       programs straightens permission bits within the repository.

       Atfsrepair automatically updates archive files, when the  archive  file  format  or  the  arrangement  of
       archive  files  within  the AtFS subdirectory was changed. Before taking any permanent action, atfsrepair
       asks the user for a confirmation. This behaviour can be switched off by either the -n or  the  -q  option
       (see below).

       Atfsrepair  shall  not  be  called concurrently with other applications on an AtFS repository. Make sure,
       that nobody else works on the repository to be repaired as atfsrepair may ignore existing  archive  locks
       and does not set own locks.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u><b>-C</b></u>     This option causes atfsrepair to try it's hand at a derived object cache.

       <u><b>-e</b></u>     Edit  Mode. Invoking atfsrepair with this option rather serves for manipulating archive files than
              for repairing them.  It shall only be used by <u>very</u> <u>experienced</u> users.  For nearly  every  item  in
              the  archive file, <u>atfsrepair</u> asks the caller for confirmation or modification. Beware, this level
              of verbosity can be very annoying when the archive file is big.

       <u><b>-i</b></u>     Interactive mode (default).

       <u><b>-n</b></u>     Non-interactive mode. In this mode, atfsrepair tries to repair  corrupted  archive  files  without
              human assistance. It does not perform any user interaction and behaves as if the user would always
              choose the default decision in interactive mode.

       <u><b>-q</b></u>     Quiet  mode.  Same as <u>-n</u> but also supresses all informative messages.  Only error messages will be
              displayed.

       <u><b>-v</b></u>     Print current version number. No file processing is done.
