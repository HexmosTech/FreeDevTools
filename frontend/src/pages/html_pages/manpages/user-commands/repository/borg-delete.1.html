</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       borg-delete - Delete an existing repository or archives

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       borg [common options] delete [options] [REPOSITORY_OR_ARCHIVE] [ARCHIVE...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This command deletes an archive from the repository or the complete repository.

       Important: When deleting archives, repository disk space is <b>not</b> freed until you run <b>borg</b> <b>compact</b>.

       When  you  delete  a  complete  repository,  the  security  info and local cache for it (if any) are also
       deleted. Alternatively, you can delete just the local cache with the <b>--cache-only</b>  option,  or  keep  the
       security info with the <b>--keep-security-info</b> option.

       When in doubt, use <b>--dry-run</b> <b>--list</b> to see what would be deleted.

       When  using  <b>--stats</b>,  you  will get some statistics about how much data was deleted - the "Deleted data"
       deduplicated size there is most interesting as that is how much your repository will shrink.  Please note
       that the "All archives" stats refer to the state after deletion.

       You can delete multiple archives by specifying their common prefix, if they have one, using the  <b>--prefix</b>
       <b>PREFIX</b>  option. You can also specify a shell pattern to match multiple archives using the <b>--glob-archives</b>
       <b>GLOB</b> option (for more info on these patterns,  see  <u>borg_patterns</u>).  Note  that  these  two  options  are
       mutually exclusive.

       To  avoid accidentally deleting archives, especially when using glob patterns, it might be helpful to use
       the <b>--dry-run</b> to test out the command without actually making any changes to the repository.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
          # delete a single backup archive:
          $ borg delete /path/to/repo::Monday
          # actually free disk space:
          $ borg compact /path/to/repo

          # delete all archives whose names begin with the machine's hostname followed by "-"
          $ borg delete --prefix '{hostname}-' /path/to/repo

          # delete all archives whose names contain "-2012-"
          $ borg delete --glob-archives '*-2012-*' /path/to/repo

          # see what would be deleted if delete was run without --dry-run
          $ borg delete --list --dry-run -a '*-May-*' /path/to/repo

          # delete the whole repository and the related local cache:
          $ borg delete /path/to/repo
          You requested to completely DELETE the repository *including* all archives it contains:
