       tog — Git repository browser

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tog</b> [<b>-hV</b>] <u>command</u> [<u>arg</u> <u>...</u>]

       <b>tog</b> <u>path</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tog</b>  is  an  interactive  read-only browser for Git repositories.  This repository format is described in
       <u><a href="../man5/git-repository.5.html">git-repository</a></u>(5).

       <b>tog</b> supports several types of views which display repository data:

       Log view
               Displays commits in the repository's history.  This view is displayed initially if no <u>command</u>  is
               specified, or if just a <u>path</u> is specified.

       Diff view
               Displays work tree changes or changes made in a particular commit.

       Blame view
               Displays the line-by-line history of a file.

       Tree view
               Displays the tree corresponding to a particular commit.

       Ref view
               Displays references in the repository.

       <b>tog</b>  provides  global  and command-specific key bindings and options.  Some command-specific key bindings
       may be prefixed with an integer, which is denoted by N in the  descriptions  below,  and  is  used  as  a
       modifier  to  the  operation  as  indicated.  <b>tog</b> will echo digits to the screen when count modifiers are
       entered, and complete the sequence upon input of the first non-numeric character.  Count modifiers can be
       aborted by entering an unmapped key.  Once a compound command is executed, the operation can be cancelled
       with <b>C-g</b> or <b>Backspace</b>.

       Global options must precede the command name, and are as follows:

       <b>-h</b>          Display usage information.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
                   Display program version and exit immediately.

       The global key bindings are:

       <b>H,</b> <b>F1</b>   Display run-time help.  Key bindings for the focussed view  will  be  displayed.   Pressing  this
               again inside the help view will toggle the display of key bindings for all <b>tog</b> views.

       <b>Q</b>       Quit <b>tog</b>.

       <b>q</b>       Quit the view which is in focus.

       <b>Tab</b>     Switch focus between views.

       <b>F</b>       Toggle fullscreen mode for a split-screen view.  <b>tog</b> will automatically use vertical split-screen
               views if the size of the terminal window is sufficiently large.

       <b>S</b>       Switch  the  current  split-screen  layout,  and render all active views in this new layout.  The
               split-screen layout can be either vertical or horizontal.  If the terminal  is  not  wide  enough
               when switching to a vertical split, views will render in fullscreen.

       <b>-</b>       When in a split-screen view, decrease the size of the focussed split N increments (default: 1).

       <b>+</b>       When in a split-screen view, increase the size of the focussed split N increments (default: 1).

       <b>G</b>       Go to line N in the view (default: last line).

       <b>g</b>       Go to line N in the view (default: first line).

       <b>Right-arrow,</b> <b>l</b>
               Scroll view to the right N increments (default: 1).
               Output moves left on the screen.

       <b>Left-arrow,</b> <b>h</b>
               Scroll view to the left N increments (default: 1).
               Output moves right on the screen.

       <b>$</b>       Scroll view to the rightmost position.

       <b>0</b>       Scroll view left to the start of the line.

       The commands for <b>tog</b> are as follows:

       <b>log</b> [<b>-b</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>commit</u>] [<b>-r</b> <u>repository-path</u>] [<u>path</u>]
              Display  history  of  a repository.  If a <u>path</u> is specified, show only commits which modified this
              path.  If invoked in a work tree,  the  <u>path</u>  is  interpreted  relative  to  the  current  working
              directory,  and  the  work  tree's  path  prefix  is implicitly prepended.  Otherwise, the path is
              interpreted relative to the repository root.

              If invoked in a work tree, the log entry of the work tree's base commit will be prefixed with  one
              of the following annotations:

              *      work tree's base commit and the base commit of all tracked files matches the branch tip
              ~      work tree comprises mixed commits or its base commit is out-of-date

              This command is also executed if no explicit command is specified.

              The key bindings for <b>tog</b> <b>log</b> are as follows (N denotes optional prefixed count modifier):

              <b>Down-arrow,</b> <b>j,</b> <b>&gt;,</b> <b>Full</b> <b>stop,</b> <b>Ctrl-n</b>
                      Move the selection cursor down N lines (default: 1).

              <b>Up-arrow,</b> <b>k,</b> <b>&lt;,</b> <b>Comma,</b> <b>Ctrl-p</b>
                      Move the selection cursor up N lines (default: 1).

              <b>Page-down,</b> <b>Space,</b> <b>Ctrl+f,</b> <b>f</b>
                      Move the selection cursor down N pages (default: 1).

              <b>Page-up,</b> <b>Ctrl+b,</b> <b>b</b>
                      Move the selection cursor up N pages (default: 1).

              <b>Ctrl+d,</b> <b>d</b>
                      Move the selection cursor down N half pages (default: 1).

              <b>Ctrl+u,</b> <b>u</b>
                      Move the selection cursor up N half pages (default: 1).

              <b>Home,</b> <b>=</b>
                      Move the cursor to the newest commit.

              <b>End,</b> <b>*</b>  Move  the  cursor  to  the  oldest  commit.  This will traverse all commits on the current
                      branch which may take a long time depending on the number of commits  in  branch  history.
                      If needed, this operation can be cancelled with <b>C-g</b> or <b>Backspace</b>.

              <b>g</b>       Move the cursor to commit N (default: 1).

              <b>G</b>       Like <b>g</b> but defaults to the oldest commit.

              <b>Enter</b>   Open  a <b>diff</b> view showing file changes made in the currently selected commit.  If a commit
                      is marked with the <b>m</b> key map, open a diff view  showing  file  changes  made  between  the
                      marked commit and the currently selected commit.

              <b>m</b>       Mark  or  unmark  the selected commit.  When a commit is marked, pressing the <b>enter</b> key on
                      another selected commit opens a <b>diff</b> view showing the changes between  the  marked  commit
                      and the currently selected commit.

              <b>T</b>       Open a <b>tree</b> view showing the tree for the currently selected commit.

              <b>Backspace</b>
                      Show log entries for the parent directory of the currently selected path.  However when an
                      active  search  is in progress or when additional commits are loaded, <b>Backspace</b> aborts the
                      running operation.

              <b>/</b>       Prompt for a search pattern and start searching for matching commits.  The search  pattern
                      is  an  extended  regular  expression  which  is  matched  against a commit's author name,
                      committer name, log message, and commit ID.  Regular expression syntax  is  documented  in
                      <u><a href="../man7/re_format.7.html">re_format</a></u>(7).

              <b>&amp;</b>       Prompt  for  a  pattern  and limit the log view's list of commits to those which match the
                      pattern.  If no pattern is specified, i.e. the <b>&amp;</b> prompt is  immediately  closed  with  the
                      Enter key, then the pattern is cleared.  Until the pattern is cleared, the limited list of
                      commits  replaces  the  full list of commits for all operations supported by the log view.
                      For example, a search started with <b>/</b> will search the limited list of commits, rather  than
                      searching  all  commits.   The  pattern is an extended regular expression which is matched
                      against a commit's author name, committer name,  log  message,  and  commit  ID.   Regular
                      expression syntax is documented in <u><a href="../man7/re_format.7.html">re_format</a></u>(7).

              <b>n</b>       Find the Nth next commit which matches the current search pattern (default: 1).
                      Searching continues until either a match is found or <b>C-g</b> or the <b>Backspace</b> key is pressed.

              <b>N</b>       Find the Nth previous commit which matches the current search pattern (default: 1).
                      Searching continues until either a match is found or <b>C-g</b> or the <b>Backspace</b> key is pressed.

              <b>Ctrl+l</b>  Reload the <b>log</b> view with new commits found in the repository or new work tree changes.

              <b>B</b>       Reload  the  <b>log</b>  view  and  toggle  display  of merged commits.  The <b>-b</b> option determines
                      whether merged commits are displayed initially.

              <b>R</b>       Open a <b>ref</b> view listing all references in the repository.  This can then be used to open a
                      new <b>log</b> view for arbitrary branches and tags.

              <b>@</b>       Toggle between showing the committer name and the author name.

              The options for <b>tog</b> <b>log</b> are as follows:

              <b>-b</b>      Display individual commits which were merged into the current branch from other  branches.
                      By  default,  <b>tog</b>  <b>log</b>  shows  the  linear  history of the current branch only.  The <b>B</b> key
                      binding can be used to toggle display of merged commits at run-time.

              <b>-c</b> <u>commit</u>
                      Start traversing history at the specified <u>commit</u>.  The expected argument is a  commit  ID,
                      or a reference name or keyword which will be resolved to a commit ID.  An abbreviated hash
                      argument  will be expanded to a full commit ID automatically, provided the abbreviation is
                      unique.  The keywords ":base" and ":head" resolve to  the  work  tree's  base  commit  and
                      branch  head, respectively.  The former is only valid if invoked in a work tree, while the
                      latter will resolve to the tip of the work tree's current branch  if  invoked  in  a  work
                      tree,  otherwise  it  will  resolve  to  the  repository's  HEAD  reference.  Keywords and
                      references may be appended with ":+" or ":-" modifiers and an optional integer N to denote
                      the Nth descendant or antecedent by first parent  traversal,  respectively;  for  example,
                      <b>:head:-2</b> denotes the work tree branch head's 2nd generation ancestor, and <b>:base:+4</b> denotes
                      the  4th  generation descendant of the work tree's base commit.  Similarly, <b>foobar:+3</b> will
                      denote the 3rd generation descendant of the commit resolved by the "foobar" reference.   A
                      ":+"  or  ":-"  modifier  without  a  trailing integer has an implicit "1" appended (e.g.,
                      <b>:base:+</b> is equivalent to <b>:base:+1</b>).

              <b>-r</b> <u>repository-path</u>
                      Use the repository at the specified path.  If not  specified,  assume  the  repository  is
                      located  at  or  above  the current working directory.  If this directory is a <u><a href="../man1/got.1.html">got</a></u>(1) work
                      tree, use the repository path associated with this work tree.

       <b>diff</b> [<b>-asw</b>] [<b>-C</b> <u>number</u>] [<b>-c</b> <u>commit</u>] [<b>-r</b> <u>repository-path</u>] [<u>object1</u> <u>object2</u> | <u>path</u> <u>...</u>]
              If invoked within a work tree without any arguments, display all local changes in the  work  tree.
              If one or more <u>path</u> arguments are specified, only show changes within the specified paths.

              Alternatively,  if  two  object  arguments  are specified, display the differences between the two
              objects in the repository.  Treat each of the two arguments as a reference, a tag name, an  object
              ID,  or a keyword and display differences between the corresponding objects.  Both objects must be
              of the same type (blobs, trees, or commits).  An abbreviated hash argument will be expanded  to  a
              full  commit  ID  automatically,  provided  the  abbreviation is unique.  The keywords ":base" and
              ":head" resolve to the work tree's base commit and branch head, respectively.  The former is  only
              valid  if  invoked  in  a  work  tree, while the latter will resolve to the tip of the work tree's
              current branch if invoked in a work tree, otherwise it  will  resolve  to  the  repository's  HEAD
              reference.   Keywords  and  references may be appended with ":+" or ":-" modifiers and an optional
              integer N to denote the Nth descendant or antecedent by first parent traversal, respectively;  for
              example,  <b>:head:-2</b>  denotes  the  work  tree  branch  head's 2nd generation ancestor, and <b>:base:+4</b>
              denotes the 4th generation descendant of the work tree's base commit.  Similarly,  <b>foobar:+3</b>  will
              denote  the 3rd generation descendant of the commit resolved by the "foobar" reference.  A ":+" or
              ":-" modifier without a trailing integer has an implicit "1" appended (e.g., <b>:base:+</b> is equivalent
              to <b>:base:+1</b>).

              The key bindings for <b>tog</b> <b>diff</b> are as follows (N denotes optional prefixed count modifier):

              <b>a</b>       Toggle treatment of file contents as ASCII text even if binary data was detected.

              <b>Down-arrow,</b> <b>j,</b> <b>Ctrl-n</b>
                      Scroll down N lines (default: 1).

              <b>Up-arrow,</b> <b>k,</b> <b>Ctrl-p</b>
                      Scroll up N lines (default: 1).

              <b>Page-down,</b> <b>Space,</b> <b>Ctrl+f,</b> <b>f</b>
                      Scroll down N pages (default: 1).

              <b>Page-up,</b> <b>Ctrl+b,</b> <b>b</b>
                      Scroll up N pages (default: 1).

              <b>Ctrl+d,</b> <b>d</b>
                      Scroll down N half pages (default: 1).

              <b>Ctrl+u,</b> <b>u</b>
                      Scroll up N half pages (default: 1).

              <b>Home</b>    Scroll to the top of the view.

              <b>End</b>     Scroll to the bottom of the view.

              <b>g</b>       Scroll to line N (default: 1).

              <b>G</b>       Like <b>g</b> but defaults to the last line in the diff.

              <b>(</b>       Navigate to the Nth previous file in the diff (default: 1).

              <b>)</b>       Navigate to the Nth next file in the diff (default: 1).

              <b>{</b>       Navigate to the Nth previous hunk in the diff (default: 1).

              <b>}</b>       Navigate to the Nth next hunk in the diff (default: 1).

              <b>[</b>       Reduce diff context by N lines (default: 1).

              <b>]</b>       Increase diff context by N lines (default: 1).

              <b>&lt;,</b> <b>Comma,</b> <b>K</b>
                      If the <b>diff</b> view was opened via the <b>log</b> view, move to the Nth previous  (younger)  commit.
                      If  the  diff  was  opened  via the <b>blame</b> view, move to the Nth previous line and load the
                      corresponding commit (default: 1).

              <b>&gt;,</b> <b>Full</b> <b>stop,</b> <b>J</b>
                      If the <b>diff</b> view was opened via the <b>log</b> view, move to the Nth next (older) commit.  If the
                      diff was opened via the <b>blame</b> view, move to the Nth next line and load  the  corresponding
                      commit (default: 1).

              <b>p</b>       Write  the  currently viewed diff to a patch file in <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u>.  The patch pathname is drawn to
                      the status line.

              <b>/</b>       Prompt for a search pattern and start searching for matching lines.  The search pattern is
                      an extended regular expression.  Regular expression syntax is documented in <u><a href="../man7/re_format.7.html">re_format</a></u>(7).

              <b>n</b>       Find the Nth next line which matches the current search pattern (default: 1).

              <b>N</b>       Find the Nth previous line which matches the current search pattern (default: 1).

              <b>w</b>       Toggle display of whitespace-only changes.

              <b>A</b>       Change the diff algorithm.  Supported diff algorithms are  Myers  (quick  and  dirty)  and
                      Patience (slow and tidy).  This is a global setting which also affects the <b>blame</b> view.

              The options for <b>tog</b> <b>diff</b> are as follows:

              <b>-a</b>      Treat file contents as ASCII text even if binary data is detected.

              <b>-C</b> <u>number</u>
                      Set  the  number  of  context lines shown in the diff.  By default, 3 lines of context are
                      shown.

              <b>-c</b> <u>commit</u>
                      Show differences between commits in the repository.  This option may be  used  up  to  two
                      times.   When  used only once, show differences between the specified <u>commit</u> and its first
                      parent commit.  When used twice, show differences between the two specified commits.

                      The expected argument is a commit ID hash, or an existing reference, tag name, or keyword,
                      which is resolved to a commit ID.  Unique abbreviated  hash  arguments  are  automatically
                      expanded  to  a  full hash.  Both objects must be of the same type (i.e., blobs, trees, or
                      commits).

                      If the <b>-c</b> option is used, all non-option arguments are interpreted as paths.   If  one  or
                      more such <u>path</u> arguments are provided, only show differences for the specified paths.

              <b>A</b>       Change the diff algorithm.  Supported diff algorithms are  Myers  (quick  and  dirty)  and
                      Patience (slow and tidy).  This is a global setting which also affects the <b>diff</b> view.

              The options for <b>tog</b> <b>blame</b> are as follows:

              <b>-c</b> <u>commit</u>
                      Start  traversing  history at the specified <u>commit</u>.  The expected argument is a commit ID,
                      or a reference name or keyword which will be resolved to a commit ID.  An abbreviated hash
                      argument will be expanded to a full commit ID automatically, provided the abbreviation  is
                      unique.   The  keywords  ":base"  and  ":head"  resolve to the work tree's base commit and
                      branch head, respectively.  The former is only valid if invoked in a work tree, while  the
                      latter  will  resolve  to  the  tip of the work tree's current branch if invoked in a work
                      tree, otherwise it  will  resolve  to  the  repository's  HEAD  reference.   Keywords  and
                      references may be appended with ":+" or ":-" modifiers and an optional integer N to denote
                      the  Nth  descendant  or  antecedent by first parent traversal, respectively; for example,
                      <b>:head:-2</b> denotes the work tree branch head's 2nd generation ancestor, and <b>:base:+4</b> denotes
                      the 4th generation descendant of the work tree's base commit.  Similarly,  <b>foobar:+3</b>  will
                      denote  the 3rd generation descendant of the commit resolved by the "foobar" reference.  A
                      ":+" or ":-" modifier without a trailing integer  has  an  implicit  "1"  appended  (e.g.,
                      <b>:base:+</b> is equivalent to <b>:base:+1</b>).

              <b>-r</b> <u>repository-path</u>
                      Use  the  repository  at  the  specified path.  If not specified, assume the repository is
                      located at or above the current working directory.  If this directory  is  a  <u><a href="../man1/got.1.html">got</a></u>(1)  work
                      tree, use the repository path associated with this work tree.

       <b>tree</b> [<b>-c</b> <u>commit</u>] [<b>-r</b> <u>repository-path</u>] [<u>path</u>]
              Display the repository tree.  If a <u>path</u> is specified, show tree entries at this path.

              Displayed tree entries may carry one of the following trailing annotations:

              @      entry is a symbolic link
              /      entry is a directory
              *      entry is an executable file
              $      entry is a Git submodule

              Symbolic link entries are also annotated with the target path of the link.

              The key bindings for <b>tog</b> <b>tree</b> are as follows (N denotes optional prefixed count modifier):

                      new <b>tree</b> view for arbitrary branches and tags.

              <b>Backspace</b>
                      Move back to the Nth parent directory (default: 1).

              <b>i</b>       Show object IDs for all objects displayed in the <b>tree</b> view.

              <b>/</b>       Prompt for a search pattern and start searching for matching  tree  entries.   The  search
                      pattern  is an extended regular expression which is matched against the tree entry's name.
                      Regular expression syntax is documented in <u><a href="../man7/re_format.7.html">re_format</a></u>(7).

              <b>n</b>       Find the Nth next tree entry which matches the current search pattern (default: 1).

              <b>N</b>       Find the Nth previous tree entry which matches the current search pattern (default: 1).

              The options for <b>tog</b> <b>tree</b> are as follows:

              <b>-c</b> <u>commit</u>
                      Start traversing history at the specified <u>commit</u>.  The expected argument is a  commit  ID,
                      or a reference name or keyword which will be resolved to a commit ID.  An abbreviated hash
                      argument  will be expanded to a full commit ID automatically, provided the abbreviation is
