</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       got — Game of Trees

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>got</b> [<b>-hV</b>] <u>command</u> [<u>arg</u> <u>...</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>got</b> is a version control system which stores the history of tracked files in a Git repository, as used by
       the Git version control system.  This repository format is described in <u><a href="../man5/git-repository.5.html">git-repository</a></u>(5).

       <b>got</b>  is  a  “distributed”  version  control  system  because  every  copy  of  a repository is writeable.
       Modifications made to files can be synchronized between repositories at any time.

       Files managed by <b>got</b> must be checked out from the repository for modification.   Checked  out  files  are
       stored in a <u>work</u> <u>tree</u> which can be placed at an arbitrary directory in the filesystem hierarchy.  The on-
       disk format of this work tree is described in <u><a href="../man5/got-worktree.5.html">got-worktree</a></u>(5).

       The  <b>got</b>  utility  provides global and command-specific options.  Global options must precede the command
       name, and are as follows:

       <b>-h</b>          Display usage information and exit immediately.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
                   Display program version and exit immediately.

       The <b>got</b> utility only provides commands needed to perform version  control  tasks.   Commands  needed  for
       repository  maintenance  tasks  are  provided  by  <u><a href="../man1/gotadmin.1.html">gotadmin</a></u>(1).   Git  repository server functionality is
       provided by <u><a href="../man8/gotd.8.html">gotd</a></u>(8).  A repository interface for web browsers is provided by <u><a href="../man8/gotwebd.8.html">gotwebd</a></u>(8).  An  interactive
       repository interface for the terminal is provided by <u><a href="../man1/tog.1.html">tog</a></u>(1).

       The commands for <b>got</b> are as follows:

       <b>init</b> [<b>-A</b> <u>hashing-algorithm</u>] [<b>-b</b> <u>branch</u>] <u>repository-path</u>
                 Create a new empty repository at the specified <u>repository-path</u>.

                 After  <b>got</b> <b>init</b>, the new repository must be populated before <b>got</b> <b>checkout</b> can be used.  The <b>got</b>
                 <b>import</b> command can be used to populate the new repository with data  from  a  local  directory.
                 Alternatively,  on a server running <u><a href="../man8/gotd.8.html">gotd</a></u>(8), the new repository can be made available to <u><a href="../man1/got.1.html">got</a></u>(1)
                 or <u><a href="../man1/git.1.html">git</a></u>(1) clients by adding the repository to <u><a href="../man5/gotd.conf.5.html">gotd.conf</a></u>(5) and restarting <u><a href="../man8/gotd.8.html">gotd</a></u>(8).  Clients may
                 then clone the new repository from  the  server,  populate  the  cloned  repository,  and  then
                 populate the new repository on the server via <b>got</b> <b>send</b> or <b>git</b> <b>push</b>.

                 The options for <b>got</b> <b>init</b> are as follows:

                 <b>-A</b> <u>hashing-algorithm</u>
                         Configure  the  repository's  <u>hashing-algorithm</u>  used for the computation of Git object
                         IDs.  Possible values are <b>sha1</b> (the default) or <b>sha256</b>.

                 <b>-b</b> <u>branch</u>
                         Make the repository's HEAD reference point to  the  specified  <u>branch</u>  instead  of  the
                         default branch “main”.

                 The <b>got</b> <b>init</b> command is equivalent to <b>gotadmin</b> <b>init</b>.

       <b>import</b> [<b>-b</b> <u>branch</u>] [<b>-I</b> <u>pattern</u>] [<b>-m</b> <u>message</u>] [<b>-r</b> <u>repository-path</u>] <u>directory</u>
                       (alias: <b>im</b>)
                 Create  an  initial  commit  in  a  repository  from  the  file  hierarchy within the specified
                 <u>directory</u>.  The created commit will not have any parent commits, i.e. it will be a root commit.
                 Also create a new reference which provides a branch name for the newly  created  commit.   Show
                 the path of each imported file to indicate progress.

                 The <b>got</b> <b>import</b> command requires the GOT_AUTHOR environment variable to be set, unless an author
                 has been configured in <u><a href="../man5/got.conf.5.html">got.conf</a></u>(5) or Git's user.name and user.email configuration settings can
                 be  obtained  from  the  repository's  <u>.git/config</u>  file  or  from  Git's  global  <u><a href="file:~/.gitconfig">~/.gitconfig</a></u>
                 configuration file.

                 The options for <b>got</b> <b>import</b> are as follows:

                 <b>-b</b> <u>branch</u>
                         Create the specified <u>branch</u>.  If this option is not specified, a  branch  corresponding
                         to the repository's HEAD reference will be used.  Use of this option is required if the
                         branch resolved via the repository's HEAD reference already exists.

                 <b>-I</b> <u>pattern</u>
                         Ignore  files  or  directories  with  a name which matches the specified <u>pattern</u>.  This
                         option may be specified multiple times to build a list of ignore patterns.  The <u>pattern</u>
                         follows the globbing rules documented in <u><a href="../man7/glob.7.html">glob</a></u>(7).  Ignore patterns  which  end  with  a
                         slash, “/”, will only match directories.

                 <b>-m</b> <u>message</u>
                         Use the specified log message when creating the new commit.  Without the <b>-m</b> option, <b>got</b>
                         <b>import</b>  opens  a  temporary  file  in  an  editor  where  a log message can be written.
                         Quitting the editor without saving the file will abort the import operation.

                 <b>-r</b> <u>repository-path</u>
                         Use the repository at the specified path.  If not specified, assume the  repository  is
                         located at or above the current working directory.

       <b>clone</b> [<b>-almqv</b>] [<b>-b</b> <u>branch</u>] [<b>-i</b> <u>identity-file</u>] [<b>-J</b> <u>jumphost</u>] [<b>-R</b> <u>reference</u>] <u>repository-URL</u> [<u>directory</u>]
                       (alias: <b>cl</b>)
                 Clone  a  Git  repository  at the specified <u>repository-URL</u> into the specified <u>directory</u>.  If no
                 <u>directory</u> is specified, the directory name  will  be  derived  from  the  name  of  the  cloned
                 repository.  <b>got</b> <b>clone</b> will refuse to run if the <u>directory</u> already exists.

                 The  <u>repository-URL</u>  specifies  a  protocol  scheme, a server hostname, an optional port number
                 separated from the hostname  by  a  colon,  and  a  path  to  the  repository  on  the  server:
                 scheme://hostname:port/path/to/repository

                 The following protocol schemes are supported:

                 git    The  Git  protocol  as implemented by the <u><a href="../man1/git-daemon.1.html">git-daemon</a></u>(1) server.  Use of this protocol is
                        discouraged since it supports neither authentication nor encryption.

                 ssh    The Git protocol wrapped in an authenticated and encrypted  <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1)  tunnel.   With  this
                        protocol the hostname may contain an embedded username for <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) to use: <u>user@hostname</u>

                 http   The  “smart”  Git  HTTP protocol.  Not compatible with servers using the “dumb” Git HTTP
                        protocol.

                        The “smart” Git HTTP protocol is supported by <b>got</b> <b>clone</b> and <b>got</b> <b>fetch</b>, but  not  by  <b>got</b>
                        <b>send</b>.   Sending  from  a repository cloned over HTTP will require use of a <b>send</b> block in
                        <u><a href="../man5/got.conf.5.html">got.conf</a></u>(5) to ensure that the “ssh://” protocol will be used by <b>got</b> <b>send</b>.

                        Use of this protocol  is  discouraged  since  it  supports  neither  authentication  nor
                        encryption.

                 https  The “smart” Git HTTP protocol wrapped in SSL/TLS.

                 Objects in the cloned repository are stored in a pack file which is downloaded from the server.
                 This  pack file will then be indexed to facilitate access to the objects stored within.  If any
                 objects in the pack file are stored in deltified form, all deltas will  be  fully  resolved  in
                 order to compute the ID of such objects.  This can take some time.  More details about the pack
                 file format are documented in <u><a href="../man5/git-repository.5.html">git-repository</a></u>(5).

                 <b>got</b>  <b>clone</b>  creates a remote repository entry in the <u><a href="../man5/got.conf.5.html">got.conf</a></u>(5) and <u>config</u> files of the cloned
                 repository to store the <u>repository-url</u> and any <u>branch</u> or <u>reference</u> arguments for future use  by
                 <b>got</b> <b>fetch</b> or <u><a href="../man1/git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch</a></u>(1).

                 The options for <b>got</b> <b>clone</b> are as follows:

                 <b>-a</b>      Fetch  all  branches from the remote repository's “refs/heads/” reference namespace and
                         set <b>fetch_all_branches</b> in the cloned repository's <u><a href="../man5/got.conf.5.html">got.conf</a></u>(5) file for  future  use  by
                         <b>got</b>  <b>fetch</b>.   If  this  option  is  not  specified,  a  branch  resolved via the remote
                         repository's HEAD reference will be fetched.  Cannot  be  used  together  with  the  <b>-b</b>
                         option.

                 <b>-b</b> <u>branch</u>
                         Fetch  the  specified  <u>branch</u>  from  the  remote  repository's  “refs/heads/” reference
                         namespace.  This option may be specified multiple times to build a list of branches  to
                         fetch.  If the branch corresponding to the remote repository's HEAD reference is not in
                         this list, the cloned repository's HEAD reference will be set to the first branch which
                         was  fetched.   If  this  option  is  not  specified,  a branch resolved via the remote
                         repository's HEAD reference will be fetched.  Cannot  be  used  together  with  the  <b>-a</b>
                         option.

                 <b>-i</b> <u>identity-file</u>
                         Specify  an  <u>identity-file</u>,  containing a private SSH key, to use with SSH connections.
                         The same option will be passed to <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1).

                 <b>-J</b> <u>jumphost</u>
                         Specify a <u>jumphost</u> to use with SSH connections.  The same  option  will  be  passed  to
                         <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1).

                 <b>-l</b>      List  branches  and  tags  available  for  fetching from the remote repository and exit
                         immediately.  Cannot be used together with any of the other options except <b>-q</b> and <b>-v</b>.

                 <b>-m</b>      Create the cloned repository as a mirror of the original repository.  This is useful if
                         the cloned repository will not be used to store locally created commits.

                         The repository's <u><a href="../man5/got.conf.5.html">got.conf</a></u>(5) and <u>config</u> files will be set up with the  “mirror”  option
                         enabled,  such  that  <b>got</b> <b>fetch</b> or <u><a href="../man1/git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch</a></u>(1) will write incoming changes directly to
                         branches in the “refs/heads/” reference namespace,  rather  than  to  branches  in  the
                         “refs/remotes/”  namespace.   This  avoids  the  usual requirement of having to run <b>got</b>
                         <b>rebase</b> or <b>got</b> <b>merge</b> after <b>got</b> <b>fetch</b>  in  order  to  make  incoming  changes  appear  on
                         branches  in the “refs/heads/” namespace.  But maintaining custom changes in the cloned
                         repository becomes difficult since such changes will be  at  risk  of  being  discarded
                         whenever incoming changes are fetched.

                 <b>-q</b>      Suppress  progress  reporting  output.   The  same  option  will be passed to <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) if
                         applicable.

                 <b>-R</b> <u>reference</u>
                         In addition to the branches and tags that will be fetched, fetch an arbitrary <u>reference</u>
                         from the remote repository's “refs/” namespace.  This option may be specified  multiple
                         times  to  build a list of additional references to fetch.  The specified <u>reference</u> may
                         either be a path to a specific reference, or a reference namespace which will cause all
                         references in this namespace to be fetched.

                         Each reference will be mapped into the cloned repository's  “refs/remotes/”  namespace,
                         unless the <b>-m</b> option is used to mirror references directly into the cloned repository's
                         “refs/” namespace.

                         <b>got</b>  <b>clone</b> will refuse to fetch references from the remote repository's “refs/remotes/”
                         or “refs/got/” namespace.

                 <b>-v</b>      Verbose mode.  Causes <b>got</b> <b>clone</b> to print debugging messages to standard  error  output.
                         This  option  will be passed to <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) if applicable.  Multiple -v options increase the
                         verbosity.  The maximum is 3.

       <b>fetch</b> [<b>-adlqtvX</b>] [<b>-b</b> <u>branch</u>]  [<b>-i</b>  <u>identity-file</u>]  [<b>-J</b>  <u>jumphost</u>]  [<b>-R</b>  <u>reference</u>]  [<b>-r</b>  <u>repository-path</u>]
                 [<u>remote-repository</u>]
                       (alias: <b>fe</b>)
                 Fetch  new  changes  from  a remote repository.  If no <u>remote-repository</u> is specified, “origin”
                 will be used.  The remote  repository's  URL  is  obtained  from  the  corresponding  entry  in
                 <u><a href="../man5/got.conf.5.html">got.conf</a></u>(5) or Git's <u>config</u> file of the local repository, as created by <b>got</b> <b>clone</b>.

                 By  default,  any branches configured in <u><a href="../man5/got.conf.5.html">got.conf</a></u>(5) for the <u>remote-repository</u> will be fetched.
                 If <b>got</b> <b>fetch</b> is invoked in a work tree then this work tree's current branch  will  be  fetched,
                 too, provided it is present on the server.  If no branches to fetch can be found in <u><a href="../man5/got.conf.5.html">got.conf</a></u>(5)
                 or  via  a  work  tree, or said branches are not found on the server, a branch resolved via the
                 remote repository's HEAD reference will be fetched.  Likewise, if  a  HEAD  reference  for  the
                 <u>remote-repository</u>  exists but its target no longer matches the remote HEAD, then the new target
                 branch will be fetched.  This default behaviour can be overridden with the <b>-a</b> and <b>-b</b> options.

                 New changes will be stored in a separate pack file downloaded  from  the  server.   Over  time,
                 small  pack  files  will  accumulate  as  a  result  of repeatedly running <b>got</b> <b>fetch</b>.  For best
                 performance, multiple small pack files can be combined into a  single  larger  pack  file  with
                 <b>gotadmin</b> <b>cleanup</b>.  The number of pack files in the repository is displayed by <b>gotadmin</b> <b>info</b>.

                 By  default,  branch  references  in the “refs/remotes/” reference namespace will be updated to
                 point at the newly fetched commits.  The <b>got</b> <b>rebase</b> or <b>got</b> <b>merge</b> command can then  be  used  to
                 make  new  changes visible on branches in the “refs/heads/” namespace, merging incoming changes
                 with the changes on those branches as necessary.

                 If the repository was created as a  mirror  with  <b>got</b>  <b>clone</b>  <b>-m</b>,  then  all  branches  in  the
                 “refs/heads/”  namespace  will  be  updated directly to match the corresponding branches in the
                 remote repository.  If those branches contained local commits, these commits will no longer  be
                 reachable  via  a  reference  and will therefore be at risk of being discarded by Git's garbage
                 collector or <b>gotadmin</b> <b>cleanup</b>.  Maintaining custom changes in a mirror repository is  therefore
                 discouraged.

                 In  any  case,  references  in  the  “refs/tags/”  namespace  will always be fetched and mapped
                 directly to local references in the same namespace.

                 The options for <b>got</b> <b>fetch</b> are as follows:

                 <b>-a</b>      Fetch all branches from the  remote  repository's  “refs/heads/”  reference  namespace.
                         This option can be enabled by default for specific repositories in <u><a href="../man5/got.conf.5.html">got.conf</a></u>(5).  Cannot
                         be used together with the <b>-b</b> option.

                 <b>-b</b> <u>branch</u>
                         Fetch  the  specified  <u>branch</u>  from  the  remote  repository's  “refs/heads/” reference
                         namespace.  This option may be specified multiple times to build a list of branches  to
                         fetch.  Cannot be used together with the <b>-a</b> option.

                 <b>-d</b>      Delete  branches  and tags from the local repository which are no longer present in the
                         remote repository.  Only references are deleted.   Any  commit,  tree,  tag,  and  blob
                         objects  belonging  to  deleted  branches  or  tags remain in the repository and may be
                         removed separately with Git's garbage collector or <b>gotadmin</b> <b>cleanup</b>.

                 <b>-i</b> <u>identity-file</u>
                         Specify an <u>identity-file</u>, containing a private SSH key, to use  with  SSH  connections.
                         The same option will be passed to <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1).

                 <b>-J</b> <u>jumphost</u>
                         Specify  a  <u>jumphost</u>  to  use  with SSH connections.  The same option will be passed to
                         <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1).

                 <b>-l</b>      List branches and tags available for fetching  from  the  remote  repository  and  exit
                         immediately.   Cannot be used together with any of the other options except <b>-v</b>, <b>-q</b>, and
                         <b>-r</b>.

                 <b>-q</b>      Suppress progress reporting output.  The same  option  will  be  passed  to  <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1)  if
                         applicable.

                 <b>-R</b> <u>reference</u>
                         In addition to the branches and tags that will be fetched, fetch an arbitrary <u>reference</u>
                         from  the remote repository's “refs/” namespace.  This option may be specified multiple
                         times to build a list of additional references to fetch.  The specified  <u>reference</u>  may
                         either be a path to a specific reference, or a reference namespace which will cause all
                         references in this namespace to be fetched.

                         Each  reference  will  be mapped into the local repository's “refs/remotes/” namespace,
                         unless the local repository was created as a mirror with <b>got</b> <b>clone</b>  <b>-m</b>  in  which  case
                         references will be mapped directly into the local repository's “refs/” namespace.

                         Once  a reference has been fetched, a branch based on it can be created with <b>got</b> <b>branch</b>
                         if needed.

                         <b>got</b> <b>fetch</b> will refuse to fetch references from the remote repository's  “refs/remotes/”
                         or “refs/got/” namespace.

                 <b>-r</b> <u>repository-path</u>
                         Use  the  repository at the specified path.  If not specified, assume the repository is
                         located at or above the current working directory.  If this directory  is  a  <b>got</b>  work
                         tree, use the repository path associated with this work tree.

                 <b>-t</b>      Allow  existing  references  in  the  “refs/tags”  namespace to be updated if they have
                         changed on the server.  If not specified, only new tag references will be created.

                 <b>-v</b>      Verbose mode.  Causes <b>got</b> <b>fetch</b> to print debugging messages to standard  error  output.
                         The  same  option will be passed to <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) if applicable.  Multiple -v options increase
                         the verbosity.  The maximum is 3.

                 <b>-X</b>      Delete all references which correspond to a  particular  <u>remote-repository</u>  instead  of
                         fetching  new  changes.   This  can be useful when a remote repository is being removed
                         from <u><a href="../man5/got.conf.5.html">got.conf</a></u>(5).

                         With <b>-X</b>, the <u>remote-repository</u> argument is mandatory and no other  options  except  <b>-r</b>,
                         <b>-v</b>, and <b>-q</b> are allowed.

                         Only  references  are  deleted.  Any commit, tree, tag, and blob objects fetched from a
                         remote repository will generally be stored in pack files and may be removed  separately
                         with <b>gotadmin</b> <b>cleanup</b> and Git's garbage collector.

       <b>checkout</b> [<b>-Eq</b>] [<b>-b</b> <u>branch</u>] [<b>-c</b> <u>commit</u>] [<b>-p</b> <u>path-prefix</u>] <u>repository-path</u> [<u>work-tree-path</u>]
                       (alias: <b>co</b>)
                 Copy  files  from  a  repository  into a new work tree.  Show the status of each affected file,
                 using the following status codes:

                 A      new file was added
                 E      file already exists in work tree's meta-data

                 If the <u>work</u> <u>tree</u> <u>path</u> is not specified, either use the last component of <u>repository</u> <u>path</u>, or if
                 a <u>path</u> <u>prefix</u> was specified use the last component of <u>path</u> <u>prefix</u>.

                 The options for <b>got</b> <b>checkout</b> are as follows:

                 <b>-b</b> <u>branch</u>
                         Check out files from a  commit  on  the  specified  <u>branch</u>.   If  this  option  is  not
                         specified, a branch resolved via the repository's HEAD reference will be used.

                 <b>-c</b> <u>commit</u>
                         Check  out  files  from the specified <u>commit</u> on the selected branch.  If this option is
                         not specified, the most recent commit on the selected branch will be used.

                         The expected <u>commit</u> argument is a commit ID, or a reference name  or  a  keyword  which
                         will  be  resolved  to a commit ID.  An abbreviated hash argument will be expanded to a
                         full commit ID automatically,  provided  the  abbreviation  is  unique.   The  keywords
                         ":base" and ":head" resolve to the repository's HEAD reference, or, if the <b>-b</b> option is
                         used, the head of the checked-out <u>branch</u>.  Keywords and reference names may be appended
                         with  ":+"  or ":-" modifiers and an optional integer N to denote the Nth descendant or
                         antecedent by first parent traversal, respectively; for example, <b>:head:-2</b>  denotes  the
                         work  tree  branch  head's  2nd  generation  ancestor,  and  <b>foo:-3</b> will denote the 3rd
                         generation ancestor of the commit resolved by the "foo" reference.  If an integer  does
                         not  follow  the  ":+" or ":-" modifier, a "1" is implicitly appended (e.g., <b>:head:-</b> is
                         equivalent to <b>:head:-1</b>).

                         If the specified <u>commit</u> is not contained in the selected  branch,  a  different  branch
                         which  contains this commit must be specified with the <b>-b</b> option.  If no such branch is
                         known, a new branch must be created for this commit with <b>got</b> <b>branch</b> before <b>got</b> <b>checkout</b>
                         can be used.  Checking out work trees with  an  unknown  branch  is  intentionally  not
                         supported.

                 <b>-E</b>      Proceed  with  the  checkout  operation  even if the directory at <u>work-tree-path</u> is not
                         empty.  Existing files will be left intact.

                 <b>-p</b> <u>path-prefix</u>
                         Restrict the work tree to a subset of the  repository's  tree  hierarchy.   Only  files
                         beneath the specified <u>path-prefix</u> will be checked out.

                 <b>-q</b>      Silence progress output.

       <b>update</b> [<b>-q</b>] [<b>-b</b> <u>branch</u>] [<b>-c</b> <u>commit</u>] [<u>path</u> <u>...</u>]
                       (alias: <b>up</b>)
                 Update  an existing work tree to a different <u>commit</u>.  Change existing files in the work tree as
                 necessary to match file contents of this commit.  Preserve any local changes in the  work  tree
                 and merge them with the incoming changes.

                 Files which already contain merge conflicts will not be updated to avoid further complications.
                 Such  files  will  be  updated  when  <b>got</b>  <b>update</b>  is run again after merge conflicts have been
                 resolved.  If the conflicting changes are no longer needed, affected files can be reverted with
                 <b>got</b> <b>revert</b> before running <b>got</b> <b>update</b> again.

                 Show the status of each affected file, using the following status codes:

                 U      file was updated and contained no local changes
                 G      file was updated and local changes were merged cleanly
                 C      file was updated and conflicts occurred during merge
                 D      file was deleted
                 d      file's deletion was prevented by local modifications
                 A      new file was added
                 ~      versioned file is obstructed by a non-regular file
                 !      a missing versioned file was restored
                 #      file was not updated because it contains merge conflicts
                 ?      changes destined for an unversioned file were not merged

                 If no <u>path</u> is specified, update the entire work tree.  Otherwise, restrict the update operation
                 to files at or within the specified paths.  Each path  is  required  to  exist  in  the  update
                 operation's  target  commit.   Files  in  the  work  tree  outside  specified paths will remain
                 unchanged and will retain their previously recorded base commit.  Some <b>got</b> commands may  refuse
                 to  run while the work tree contains files from multiple base commits.  The base commit of such
                 a work tree can be made  consistent  by  running  <b>got</b>  <b>update</b>  across  the  entire  work  tree.
                 Specifying a <u>path</u> is incompatible with the <b>-b</b> option.

                 <b>got</b>  <b>update</b>  cannot  update  paths  with  staged changes.  If changes have been staged with <b>got</b>
                 <b>stage</b>, these changes must first be committed with <b>got</b> <b>commit</b> or unstaged with <b>got</b> <b>unstage</b>.

                 The options for <b>got</b> <b>update</b> are as follows:

                 <b>-b</b> <u>branch</u>
                         Switch the work tree's branch reference to the specified  <u>branch</u>  before  updating  the
                         work tree.  This option requires that all paths in the work tree are updated.

                         As  usual,  any  local  changes in the work tree will be preserved.  This can be useful
                         when switching to a newly created branch in order to commit existing local  changes  to
                         this branch.

                         Any  local  changes  must  be dealt with separately in order to obtain a work tree with
                         pristine file contents corresponding exactly to the  specified  <u>branch</u>.   Such  changes
                         could  first  be committed to a different branch with <b>got</b> <b>commit</b>, or could be discarded
                         with <b>got</b> <b>revert</b>.

                 <b>-c</b> <u>commit</u>
                         Update the work tree to the specified <u>commit</u>.  If this option  is  not  specified,  the
                         most recent commit on the work tree's branch will be used.

                         The  expected  <u>commit</u>  argument  is a commit ID, or a reference name or a keyword which
                         will be resolved to a commit ID.  An abbreviated hash argument will be  expanded  to  a
                         full  commit  ID  automatically,  provided  the  abbreviation  is unique.  The keywords
                         ":base"  and  ":head"  resolve  to  the  work  tree's  base  commit  and  branch  head,
                         respectively.  Keywords and reference names may be appended with ":+" or ":-" modifiers
                         and  an optional integer N to denote the Nth descendant or antecedent, respectively, by
                         first parent traversal; for example, <b>:head:-2</b> denotes the work tree branch  head's  2nd
                         generation  ancestor,  and  <b>:base:+4</b>  denotes the 4th generation descendant of the work
                         tree's base commit.  Similarly, <b>foo:-3</b> will denote the 3rd generation ancestor  of  the
                         commit resolved by the "foo" reference.  If an integer does not follow the ":+" or ":-"
                         modifier, a "1" is implicitly appended (e.g., <b>:head:-</b> is equivalent to <b>:head:-1</b>).

                 <b>-q</b>      Silence progress output.

       <b>status</b> [<b>-I</b>] [<b>-S</b> <u>status-codes</u>] [<b>-s</b> <u>status-codes</u>] [<u>path</u> <u>...</u>]
                       (alias: <b>st</b>)
                 Show the current modification status of files in a work tree, using the following status codes:

                 M      modified file
                 A      file scheduled for addition in next commit
                 D      file scheduled for deletion in next commit
                 C      modified or added file which contains merge conflicts
                 !      versioned file was expected on disk but is missing
                 ~      versioned file is obstructed by a non-regular file

                 N      non-existent <u>path</u> specified on the command line

                 If  no  <u>path</u>  is  specified,  show  modifications  in  the  entire  work tree.  Otherwise, show
                 modifications at or within the specified paths.

                 If changes have been staged with <b>got</b> <b>stage</b>, staged changes  are  shown  in  the  second  output
                 column, using the following status codes:

                 M      file modification is staged
                 A      file addition is staged
                 D      file deletion is staged

                 Changes created on top of staged changes are indicated in the first column:

                 MM     file was modified after earlier changes have been staged
                 MA     file was modified after having been staged for addition

                 If  the work tree contains the results of an interrupted <b>got</b> <b>rebase</b>, <b>got</b> <b>histedit</b>, or <b>got</b> <b>merge</b>
                 operation then display a message which shows the branches involved.

                 The options for <b>got</b> <b>status</b> are as follows:

                 <b>-I</b>      Show unversioned files even if they match an ignore pattern.

                 <b>-S</b> <u>status-codes</u>
                         Suppress the output of files with a modification status matching  any  of  the  single-

                         codes from the above list of possible status codes may be specified.  For staged files,
                         status codes displayed in either column will be matched.  Cannot be used together  with
                         the <b>-s</b> option.

                 <b>-s</b> <u>status-codes</u>
                         Only  show files with a modification status matching any of the single-character status
                         codes contained in the <u>status-codes</u> argument.  Any combination of codes from the  above
                         list  of  possible  status  codes  may  be  specified.   For staged files, status codes
                         displayed in either column will be matched.   Cannot  be  used  together  with  the  <b>-S</b>
                         option.

                 For compatibility with <u><a href="../man1/cvs.1.html">cvs</a></u>(1) and <u><a href="../man1/git.1.html">git</a></u>(1), <b>got</b> <b>status</b> reads <u><a href="../man7/glob.7.html">glob</a></u>(7) patterns from <u>.cvsignore</u> and
                 <u>.gitignore</u> files in each traversed directory and will not display unversioned files which match
                 these  patterns.  Ignore patterns which end with a slash, “/”, will only match directories.  As
                 an extension to <u><a href="../man7/glob.7.html">glob</a></u>(7) matching rules, <b>got</b> <b>status</b> supports consecutive asterisks, “**”,  which
                 will  match  an  arbitrary  amount  of  directories.  Unlike <u><a href="../man1/cvs.1.html">cvs</a></u>(1), <b>got</b> <b>status</b> only supports a
                 single ignore pattern per line.  Unlike <u><a href="../man1/git.1.html">git</a></u>(1), <b>got</b> <b>status</b>  does  not  support  negated  ignore
                 patterns prefixed with “!”, and gives no special significance to the location of path component

                 Display history of a repository.  If a <u>path</u> is specified, show only commits which modified this
                 path.   If  invoked  in  a  work  tree, the <u>path</u> is interpreted relative to the current working

                         Set the number of context lines shown in diffs with <b>-p</b>.  By default, 3 lines of context
                         are shown.

                 <b>-c</b> <u>commit</u>
                         Start traversing history at the specified <u>commit</u>.  If this  option  is  not  specified,
                         default  to  the  work  tree's  current  branch  if  invoked  in a work tree, or to the
                         repository's HEAD reference.

                         The expected <u>commit</u> argument is a commit ID, or a reference name  or  a  keyword  which
                         will  be  resolved  to a commit ID.  An abbreviated hash argument will be expanded to a
                         full commit ID automatically,  provided  the  abbreviation  is  unique.   The  keywords
                         ":base"  and  ":head"  resolve  to  the  work  tree's  base  commit  and  branch  head,
                         respectively.  The former is only valid if invoked in a work  tree,  while  the  latter
                         will  resolve  to  the tip of the work tree's current branch if invoked in a work tree,
                         otherwise it will resolve to the repository's HEAD reference.  Keywords and  references
                         may be appended with ":+" or ":-" modifiers and an optional integer N to denote the Nth
                         descendant  or  antecedent,  respectively,  by  first  parent  traversal;  for example,
                         <b>:head:-2</b> denotes the HEAD reference's 2nd generation ancestor, and <b>:base:+4</b> denotes the
                         4th generation descendant of the work  tree's  base  commit.   Similarly,  <b>bar:+3</b>  will
                         denote  the 3rd generation descendant of the commit resolved by the "bar" reference.  A
                         ":+" or ":-" modifier without a trailing integer has an implicit  "1"  appended  (e.g.,
                         <b>:base:+</b> is equivalent to <b>:base:+1</b>).

                 <b>-d</b>      Display  diffstat  of  changes  introduced  in each commit.  Cannot be used with the <b>-s</b>
                         option.  Implies the <b>-P</b> option (diffstat displays a list of changed paths).

                 <b>-l</b> <u>N</u>    Limit history traversal to a given number of commits.  If this option is not specified,
                         a default limit value of zero is used, which is treated as  an  unbounded  limit.   The
                         GOT_LOG_DEFAULT_LIMIT environment variable may be set to change this default value.

                 <b>-P</b>      Display  the  list  of  file  paths  changed in each commit, using the following status
                         codes:

                         M      modified file
                         D      file was deleted
                         A      new file was added
                         m      modified file modes (executable bit only)

                         Cannot be used with the <b>-s</b> option.

                 <b>-p</b>      Display the patch of modifications made in each commit.  If a <u>path</u> is  specified,  only
                         show  the  patch  of  modifications at or within this path.  Cannot be used with the <b>-s</b>
                         option.

                 <b>-R</b>      Determine a set of commits to display as usual, but display these  commits  in  reverse
                         order.

                 <b>-r</b> <u>repository-path</u>
                         Use  the  repository at the specified path.  If not specified, assume the repository is
                         located at or above the current working directory.  If this directory  is  a  <b>got</b>  work
                         tree, use the repository path associated with this work tree.

                 <b>-S</b> <u>search-pattern</u>
                         If  specified,  show  only  commits with a log message, author name, committer name, or
                         commit ID  matched  by  the  extended  regular  expression  <u>search-pattern</u>.   Lines  in
                         committed  patches  will be matched if <b>-p</b> is specified.  File paths changed by a commit
                         will be matched if <b>-P</b>  is  specified.   Regular  expression  syntax  is  documented  in
                         <u><a href="../man7/re_format.7.html">re_format</a></u>(7).

                 <b>-s</b>      Display a short one-line summary of each commit, instead of the default history format.
                         Cannot be used together with the <b>-p</b> or <b>-P</b> option.

                 <b>-t</b>      Display  commits in topological order.  This option has no effect without the <b>-b</b> option
                         because a linear history is sorted in topological  order  by  definition.   Topological
                         sorting  is disabled by default because the present implementation requires that commit
                         history is fully traversed before any output can be shown.

                 <b>-x</b> <u>commit</u>
                         Stop traversing  commit  history  immediately  after  the  specified  <u>commit</u>  has  been
                         traversed.   Like  <b>-c</b>, the expected <u>commit</u> argument is a commit ID, or a reference name
                         or a keyword which will be resolved to a commit ID.  This option has no effect  if  the
                         specified <u>commit</u> is never traversed.

       <b>diff</b> [<b>-adPsw</b>] [<b>-C</b> <u>number</u>] [<b>-c</b> <u>commit</u>] [<b>-r</b> <u>repository-path</u>] [<u>object1</u> <u>object2</u> | <u>path</u> <u>...</u>]
                       (alias: <b>di</b>)
                 When  invoked  within  a work tree without any arguments, display all local changes in the work
                 tree.  If one or more <u>path</u> arguments are specified, only  show  changes  within  the  specified
                 paths.

                 If two arguments are provided, treat each argument as a reference, a tag name, or an object ID,
                 and  display  differences  between the corresponding objects.  Both objects must be of the same
                 type (blobs, trees, or commits).  An abbreviated hash argument  will  be  expanded  to  a  full
                 commit ID automatically, provided the abbreviation is unique.  If none of these interpretations
                 produce  a valid result or if the <b>-P</b> option is used, and if <b>got</b> <b>diff</b> is running in a work tree,
                 attempt to interpret the two arguments as paths.

                 The options for <b>got</b> <b>diff</b> are as follows:

                 <b>-a</b>      Treat file contents as ASCII text even if binary data is detected.

                 <b>-C</b> <u>number</u>
                         Set the number of context lines shown in the diff.  By default, 3 lines of context  are
                         shown.

                 <b>-c</b> <u>commit</u>
                         Show  differences between commits in the repository.  This option may be used up to two
                         times.  When used only once, show differences between  the  specified  <u>commit</u>  and  its
                         first  parent  commit.   When  used  twice,  show differences between the two specified
                         commits.

                         If the <b>-c</b> option is used, all non-option arguments will be interpreted  as  paths.   If
                         one  or  more such <u>path</u> arguments are provided, only show differences for the specified
                         paths.

                         The expected <u>commit</u> argument is a commit ID, or a reference name  or  a  keyword  which
                         will  be  resolved  to a commit ID.  An abbreviated hash argument will be expanded to a
                         full commit ID automatically,  provided  the  abbreviation  is  unique.   The  keywords
                         ":base"  and  ":head"  resolve  to  the  work  tree's  base  commit  and  branch  head,
                         respectively.  The former is only valid if invoked in a work  tree,  while  the  latter
                         will  resolve  to  the tip of the work tree's current branch if invoked in a work tree,
                         otherwise it will resolve to the repository's HEAD reference.  Keywords and  references
                         may be appended with ":+" or ":-" modifiers and an optional integer N to denote the Nth
                         descendant  or  antecedent,  respectively,  by  first  parent  traversal;  for example,
                         <b>:head:-2</b> denotes the HEAD reference's 2nd generation ancestor, and <b>:base:+4</b> denotes the
                         4th generation descendant of the work  tree's  base  commit.   Similarly,  <b>baz:+8</b>  will
                         denote the 8th generation descendant of the commit resolved by the "baz" reference.  If
                         an  integer  does  not  follow  the ":+" or ":-" modifier, a "1" is implicitly appended
                         (e.g., <b>:head:-</b> is equivalent to <b>:head:-1</b>).

                         Cannot be used together with the <b>-P</b> option.

                 <b>-d</b>      Display diffstat of changes before the actual diff by annotating each file path or blob
                         hash being diffed with the total number of lines added and  removed.   A  summary  line
                         will display the total number of changes across all files.

                 <b>-P</b>      Interpret all arguments as paths only.  This option can be used to resolve ambiguity in
                         cases  where paths look like tag names, reference names, or object IDs.  This option is
                         only valid when <b>got</b> <b>diff</b> is invoked in a work tree.

                 <b>-r</b> <u>repository-path</u>
                         Use the repository at the specified path.  If not specified, assume the  repository  is
                         located  at  or  above  the current working directory.  If this directory is a <b>got</b> work
                         tree, use the repository path associated with this work tree.

                 <b>-s</b>      Show changes staged with <b>got</b> <b>stage</b> instead of showing local changes in the  work  tree.
                         This option is only valid when <b>got</b> <b>diff</b> is invoked in a work tree.

                 <b>-w</b>      Ignore whitespace-only changes.

       <b>blame</b> [<b>-c</b> <u>commit</u>] [<b>-r</b> <u>repository-path</u>] <u>path</u>
                       (alias: <b>bl</b>)
                 Display line-by-line history of a file at the specified path.

                 The options for <b>got</b> <b>blame</b> are as follows:

                 <b>-c</b> <u>commit</u>
                         Start  traversing  history  at the specified <u>commit</u>.  The expected argument is a commit
                         ID, or a reference name or a keyword which  will  be  resolved  to  a  commit  ID.   An
                         abbreviated  hash argument will be expanded to a full commit ID automatically, provided
                         the abbreviation is unique.  The keywords ":base"  and  ":head"  resolve  to  the  work
                         tree's  base commit and branch head, respectively.  The former is only valid if invoked
                         in a work tree, while the latter will resolve to the tip of  the  work  tree's  current
                         branch  if  invoked  in a work tree, otherwise it will resolve to the repository's HEAD
                         reference.  Keywords and references may be appended with ":+" or ":-" modifiers and  an
                         optional  integer  N  to  denote  the  Nth  descendant  or  antecedent  by first parent
                         traversal, respectively; for example, <b>:head:-2</b> denotes the work tree branch head's  2nd
                         generation  ancestor,  and  <b>:base:+4</b>  denotes the 4th generation descendant of the work
                         tree's base commit.  Similarly, <b>xyz:-5</b> will denote the 5th generation ancestor  of  the
                         commit  resolved  by  the  "xyz" reference.  A ":+" or ":-" modifier without a trailing
                         integer has an implicit "1" appended (e.g., <b>:base:+</b> is equivalent to <b>:base:+1</b>).

                 <b>-r</b> <u>repository-path</u>
                         Use the repository at the specified path.  If not specified, assume the  repository  is
                         located  at  or  above  the current working directory.  If this directory is a <b>got</b> work
                         tree, use the repository path associated with this work tree.

       <b>tree</b> [<b>-iR</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>commit</u>] [<b>-r</b> <u>repository-path</u>] [<u>path</u>]
                       (alias: <b>tr</b>)
                 Display a listing of files and directories at the specified directory path in  the  repository.
                 Entries shown in this listing may carry one of the following trailing annotations:

                 @      entry is a symbolic link
                 /      entry is a directory
                 *      entry is an executable file
                 $      entry is a Git submodule

                 Symbolic link entries are also annotated with the target path of the link.

                 If no <u>path</u> is specified, list the repository path corresponding to the current directory of the
                 work tree, or the root directory of the repository if there is no work tree.

                 The options for <b>got</b> <b>tree</b> are as follows:

                 <b>-c</b> <u>commit</u>
                         List files and directories as they appear in the specified <u>commit</u>.

                         The  expected  argument  is a commit ID, or a reference name or a keyword which will be
                         resolved to a commit ID.  An abbreviated hash argument  will  be  expanded  to  a  full
                         commit ID automatically, provided the abbreviation is unique.  The keywords ":base" and
                         ":head"  resolve  to  the  work  tree's base commit and branch head, respectively.  The
                         former is only valid if invoked in a work tree, while the latter will  resolve  to  the
                         tip  of  the  work  tree's  current branch if invoked in a work tree, otherwise it will
                         resolve to the repository's HEAD reference.  Keywords and references  may  be  appended
                         with  ":+"  or ":-" modifiers and an optional integer N to denote the Nth descendant or
                         antecedent by first parent traversal, respectively; for example, <b>:head:-2</b>  denotes  the
                         work  tree  branch  head's  2nd  generation  ancestor,  and  <b>:base:+4</b>  denotes  the 4th
                         generation descendant of the work tree's base commit.  Similarly, <b>spam:-3</b>  will  denote
                         the  3rd generation ancestor of the commit resolved by the "spam" reference.  A ":+" or
                         ":-" modifier without a trailing integer has an implicit "1" appended (e.g., <b>:base:+</b> is
                         equivalent to <b>:base:+1</b>).

                 <b>-i</b>      Show object IDs of files (blob objects) and directories (tree objects).

                 <b>-R</b>      Recurse into sub-directories in the repository.

                 <b>-r</b> <u>repository-path</u>
                         Use the repository at the specified path.  If not specified, assume the  repository  is
                         located  at  or  above  the current working directory.  If this directory is a <b>got</b> work
                         tree, use the repository path associated with this work tree.

       <b>ref</b> [<b>-dlt</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>object</u>] [<b>-r</b> <u>repository-path</u>] [<b>-s</b> <u>reference</u>] [<u>name</u>]
                 Manage references in a repository.

                 References may be listed, created, deleted, and changed.  When creating, deleting, or  changing
                 a  reference  the  specified  <u>name</u>  must be an absolute reference name, i.e. it must begin with
                 “refs/”.

                 The options for <b>got</b> <b>ref</b> are as follows:

                 <b>-c</b> <u>object</u>
                         Create a reference or change an existing reference.  The reference with  the  specified
                         <u>name</u> will point at the specified <u>object</u>.

                         The  expected <u>object</u> argument is an object ID or an existing reference or tag name or a
                         keyword which will be resolved to the ID of a corresponding commit, tree, tag, or  blob
                         object.    An  abbreviated  hash  argument  will  be  expanded  to  a  full  commit  ID
                         automatically, provided the abbreviation is unique.  The keywords ":base"  and  ":head"
                         resolve  to  the  work tree's base commit and branch head, respectively.  The former is
                         only valid if invoked in a work tree, while the latter will resolve to the tip  of  the
                         work  tree's current branch if invoked in a work tree, otherwise it will resolve to the
                         repository's HEAD reference.  Keywords and reference names may be appended with ":+" or
                         ":-" modifiers and an optional integer N to denote the Nth descendant or antecedent  by
                         first  parent  traversal,  respectively;  for  example,  <b>:head:-2</b> denotes the work tree
                         branch head's 2nd generation ancestor, and <b>tagged:-3</b> will  denote  the  3rd  generation
                         ancestor  of  the  commit  resolved  by the "tagged" reference.  If an integer does not
                         follow the ":+" or ":-" modifier, a  "1"  is  implicitly  appended  (e.g.,  <b>:head:-</b>  is
                         equivalent to <b>:head:-1</b>).

                         Cannot be used together with any other options except <b>-r</b>.

                 <b>-d</b>      Delete  the  reference  with the specified <u>name</u> from the repository.  Any commit, tree,
                         tag, and blob objects belonging to deleted references remain in the repository and  may
                         be removed separately with Git's garbage collector or <b>gotadmin</b> <b>cleanup</b>.  Cannot be used
                         together with any other options except <b>-r</b>.

                 <b>-l</b>      List  references  in  the  repository.   If  no  <u>name</u>  is  specified, list all existing
                         references in the repository.  If <u>name</u> is a reference namespace, list all references in
                         this namespace.  Otherwise, show only the reference with the  given  <u>name</u>.   Cannot  be
                         used together with any other options except <b>-r</b> and <b>-t</b>.

                 <b>-r</b> <u>repository-path</u>
                         Use  the  repository at the specified path.  If not specified, assume the repository is
                         located at or above the current working directory.  If this directory  is  a  <b>got</b>  work
                         tree, use the repository path associated with this work tree.

                 <b>-s</b> <u>reference</u>
                         Create  a  symbolic  reference, or change an existing symbolic reference.  The symbolic
                         reference with the specified <u>name</u> will point at  the  specified  <u>reference</u>  which  must
                         already  exist  in  the  repository.   Care should be taken not to create loops between
                         references when this option is used.  Cannot be used together with  any  other  options
                         except <b>-r</b>.

                 <b>-t</b>      Sort  listed  references by modification time (most recently modified first) instead of
                         sorting by lexicographical order.  Use of this option requires the <b>-l</b> option to be used
                         as well.

       <b>branch</b> [<b>-lnt</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>commit</u>] [<b>-d</b> <u>name</u>] [<b>-r</b> <u>repository-path</u>] [<u>name</u>]
                       (alias: <b>br</b>)
                 Create, list, or delete branches.

                 Local branches are managed via references which live in the “refs/heads/” reference  namespace.
                 The <b>got</b> <b>branch</b> command creates references in this namespace only.

                 When  deleting branches, the specified <u>name</u> is searched in the “refs/heads” reference namespace
                 first.  If no corresponding branch is found, the  “refs/remotes”  namespace  will  be  searched
                 next.

                 If  invoked  in  a  work  tree without any arguments, print the name of the work tree's current
                 branch.

                 If a <u>name</u> argument is passed, attempt to create a branch reference with  the  given  name.   By
                 default  the  new  branch  reference will point at the latest commit on the work tree's current
                 branch if invoked in a work tree, and otherwise to a commit resolved via the repository's  HEAD
                 reference.

                 If invoked in a work tree, once the branch was created successfully switch the work tree's head
                 reference  to  the newly created branch and update files across the entire work tree, just like
                 <b>got</b> <b>update</b> <b>-b</b> <u>name</u> would do.  Show the status of each affected file, using the following status
                 codes:

                 U      file was updated and contained no local changes
                 G      file was updated and local changes were merged cleanly
                 C      file was updated and conflicts occurred during merge
                 D      file was deleted
                 A      new file was added
                 ~      versioned file is obstructed by a non-regular file
                 !      a missing versioned file was restored

                 The options for <b>got</b> <b>branch</b> are as follows:

                 <b>-c</b> <u>commit</u>
                         Make a newly created branch reference point at  the  specified  <u>commit</u>.   The  expected
                         argument  is  a  commit  ID, or a reference name or keyword which will be resolved to a
                         commit ID.  An abbreviated  hash  argument  will  be  expanded  to  a  full  commit  ID
                         automatically,  provided  the abbreviation is unique.  The keywords ":base" and ":head"
                         resolve to the work tree's base commit and branch head, respectively.   The  former  is
                         only  valid  if invoked in a work tree, while the latter will resolve to the tip of the
                         work tree's current branch if invoked in a work tree, otherwise it will resolve to  the
                         repository's HEAD reference.  Keywords and references may be appended with ":+" or ":-"
                         modifiers and an optional integer N to denote the Nth descendant or antecedent by first
                         parent  traversal,  respectively;  for  example,  <b>:head:-2</b> denotes the work tree branch
                         head's 2nd generation ancestor, and <b>:base:+4</b> denotes the 4th generation  descendant  of
                         the  work  tree's  base  commit.   Similarly,  <b>foobar:+3</b> will denote the 3rd generation
                         descendant of the commit resolved by the "foobar" reference.  A ":+" or  ":-"  modifier
                         without a trailing integer has an implicit "1" appended (e.g., <b>:base:+</b> is equivalent to
                         <b>:base:+1</b>).

                 <b>-d</b> <u>name</u>
                         Delete  the  branch  with  the  specified  <u>name</u> from the “refs/heads” or “refs/remotes”
                         reference namespace.

                         Only the branch reference is deleted.  Any commit, tree, and blob objects belonging  to
                         the  branch  remain  in the repository and may be removed separately with Git's garbage
                         collector or <b>gotadmin</b> <b>cleanup</b>.

                 <b>-l</b>      List all existing branches in the repository, including copies of remote  repositories'
                         branches in the “refs/remotes/” reference namespace.

                         If  invoked  in  a  work  tree, the work tree's current branch is shown with one of the
                         following annotations:

                         *      work tree's base commit and the base commit of all  tracked  files  matches  the
                                               branch tip
                         ~      work tree comprises mixed commits or its base commit is out-of-date

                 <b>-n</b>      Do not switch and update the work tree after creating a new branch.

                 <b>-r</b> <u>repository-path</u>
                         Use  the  repository at the specified path.  If not specified, assume the repository is
                         located at or above the current working directory.  If this directory  is  a  <b>got</b>  work
                         tree, use the repository path associated with this work tree.

                 <b>-t</b>      Sort  listed  branches  by  modification time (most recently modified first) instead of
                         sorting by lexicographical order.  Branches in the  “refs/heads/”  reference  namespace
                         are  listed before branches in “refs/remotes/” regardless.  Use of this option requires
                         the <b>-l</b> option to be used as well.

       <b>tag</b> [<b>-lsVv</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>commit</u>] [<b>-m</b> <u>message</u>] [<b>-r</b> <u>repository-path</u>] [<b>-S</b> <u>signer-id</u>] <u>name</u>
                 Manage tags in a repository.

                 Tags are managed via references which live in the “refs/tags/” reference  namespace.   The  <b>got</b>
                 <b>tag</b>  command operates on references in this namespace only.  References in this namespace point
                 at tag objects which contain a pointer to another object, a tag message, as well as author  and
                 timestamp information.

                 Attempt  to  create a tag with the given <u>name</u>, and make this tag point at the given <u>commit</u>.  If
                 no commit is specified, default to the latest commit on  the  work  tree's  current  branch  if
                 invoked in a work tree, and to a commit resolved via the repository's HEAD reference otherwise.

                 The options for <b>got</b> <b>tag</b> are as follows:

                 <b>-c</b> <u>commit</u>
                         Make  the  newly  created  tag  reference  point at the specified <u>commit</u>.  The expected
                         <u>commit</u> argument is a commit ID, or a reference or keyword which will be resolved  to  a
                         commit  ID.   An  abbreviated  hash  argument  will  be  expanded  to  a full commit ID
                         automatically, provided the abbreviation is unique.  The keywords ":base"  and  ":head"
                         resolve  to  the  work tree's base commit and branch head, respectively.  The former is
                         only valid if invoked in a work tree, while the latter will resolve to the tip  of  the
                         work  tree's current branch if invoked in a work tree, otherwise it will resolve to the
                         repository's HEAD reference.  Keywords and references may be appended with ":+" or ":-"
                         modifiers and an optional integer N to denote the Nth descendant or antecedent by first
                         parent traversal, respectively; for example, <b>:head:-2</b>  denotes  the  work  tree  branch
                         head's  2nd  generation ancestor, and <b>:base:+4</b> denotes the 4th generation descendant of
                         the work tree's base  commit.   Similarly,  <b>eggs:-3</b>  will  denote  the  3rd  generation
                         ancestor  of  the  commit  resolved  by  the "eggs" reference.  A ":+" or ":-" modifier
                         without a trailing integer has an implicit "1" appended (e.g., <b>:base:+</b> is equivalent to
                         <b>:base:+1</b>).

                 <b>-l</b>      List all existing tags in the repository instead of creating a  new  tag.   If  a  <u>name</u>
                         argument is passed, show only the tag with the given <u>name</u>.

                 <b>-m</b> <u>message</u>
                         Use  the  specified  tag message when creating the new tag.  Without the <b>-m</b> option, <b>got</b>
                         <b>tag</b> opens a temporary file in an editor where a tag message can be  written.   Quitting
                         the editor without saving the file will abort the tag operation.

                 <b>-r</b> <u>repository-path</u>
                         Use  the  repository at the specified path.  If not specified, assume the repository is
                         located at or above the current working directory.  If this directory  is  a  <b>got</b>  work
                         tree, use the repository path associated with this work tree.

                 <b>-S</b> <u>signer-id</u>
                         While creating a new tag, sign this tag with the identity given in <u>signer-id</u>.

                         For  SSH-based  signatures, <u>signer-id</u> is the path to a file which may refer to either a
                         private SSH key, or a public SSH key with the private half available via  <u><a href="../man1/ssh-agent.1.html">ssh-agent</a></u>(1).
                         <b>got</b>  <b>tag</b>  will  sign the tag object by invoking <u><a href="../man1/ssh-keygen.1.html">ssh-keygen</a></u>(1) with the <b>-Y</b> <b>sign</b> command,
                         using the signature namespace “git” for compatibility with <u><a href="../man1/git.1.html">git</a></u>(1).

                 <b>-s</b>      Display a short one-line summary of each tag, instead of the  default  history  format.
                         Can only be used with the <b>-l</b> option.

                 <b>-V</b>      Verify  tag  object signatures.  If a <u>name</u> is specified, show and verify the tag object
                         with the provided name.  Otherwise, list all tag objects and  verify  signatures  where
                         present.

                         <b>got</b>  <b>tag</b>  verifies  SSH-based  signatures by invoking <u><a href="../man1/ssh-keygen.1.html">ssh-keygen</a></u>(1) with the options <b>-Y</b>
                         <b>verify</b> <b>-f</b> <u>allowed_signers</u>.   A  path  to  the  <u>allowed_signers</u>  file  must  be  set  in
                         <u><a href="../man5/got.conf.5.html">got.conf</a></u>(5), otherwise verification is impossible.

                 <b>-v</b>      Verbose  mode.   During  SSH  signature  creation  and verification this option will be
                         passed to <u><a href="../man1/ssh-keygen.1.html">ssh-keygen</a></u>(1).  Multiple -v options increase the verbosity.  The  maximum  is
                         3.

                 By  design, the <b>got</b> <b>tag</b> command will not delete tags or change existing tags.  If a tag must be
                 deleted, the <b>got</b> <b>ref</b> command may be used to delete a tag's reference.  This should only be done
                 if the tag has not already been copied to another repository.

       <b>add</b> [<b>-IR</b>] <u>path</u> <u>...</u>
                 Schedule unversioned files in a work tree for addition to the repository in  the  next  commit.
                 By default, files which match a <b>got</b> <b>status</b> ignore pattern will not be added.

                 If  a  <u>path</u>  mentioned in the command line is not an unversioned file then <b>got</b> <b>add</b> may raise an
                 error.  To avoid unnecessary errors from paths picked up  by  file  globbing  patterns  in  the
                 shell,  paths  in  the  argument  list will be silently ignored if they are not reported by <b>got</b>
                 <b>status</b> at all, or if they are reported with one of the following status codes and do  not  have
                 changes staged via <b>got</b> <b>stage</b>:

                 M      modified file
                 A      file scheduled for addition in next commit
                 C      modified or added file which contains merge conflicts
                 m      modified file modes (executable bit only)

                 The options for <b>got</b> <b>add</b> are as follows:

                 <b>-I</b>      Add files even if they match a <b>got</b> <b>status</b> ignore pattern.

                 <b>-R</b>      Permit  recursion  into  directories.   If  this  option is not specified, <b>got</b> <b>add</b> will
                         refuse to run if a specified <u>path</u> is a directory.

       <b>remove</b> [<b>-fkR</b>] [<b>-s</b> <u>status-codes</u>] <u>path</u> <u>...</u>
                       (alias: <b>rm</b>)
                 Remove versioned files from a work tree and schedule them for deletion from the  repository  in
                 the next commit.

                 The options for <b>got</b> <b>remove</b> are as follows:

                 <b>-f</b>      Perform  the operation even if a file contains local modifications, and do not raise an
                         error if a specified <u>path</u> does not exist on disk.

                 <b>-k</b>      Keep affected files on disk.

                 <b>-R</b>      Permit recursion into directories.  If this option is not specified,  <b>got</b>  <b>remove</b>  will
                         refuse to run if a specified <u>path</u> is a directory.

                 <b>-s</b> <u>status-codes</u>
                         Only  delete  files  with  a  modification  status matching one of the single-character
                         status codes contained in the <u>status-codes</u> argument.  The following status codes may be
                         specified:

                         M      modified file (this implies the <b>-f</b> option)
                         !      versioned file expected on disk but missing

       <b>patch</b> [<b>-nR</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>commit</u>] [<b>-p</b> <u>strip-count</u>] [<u>patchfile</u>]
                       (alias: <b>pa</b>)
                 Apply changes from <u>patchfile</u> to files in a work tree.  Files added or removed by a  patch  will
                 be scheduled for addition or removal in the work tree.

                 The  patch  must  be  in  the  unified  diff format as produced by <b>got</b> <b>diff</b>, <u><a href="../man1/git-diff.1.html">git-diff</a></u>(1), or by
                 <u><a href="../man1/diff.1.html">diff</a></u>(1) and <u><a href="../man1/cvs.1.html">cvs</a></u>(1) diff when invoked with their  <b>-u</b>  options.   If  no  <u>patchfile</u>  argument  is
                 provided, read unified diff data from standard input instead.

                 If the <u>patchfile</u> contains multiple patches, then attempt to apply each of them in sequence.

                 Show the status of each affected file, using the following status codes:

                 M      file was modified
                 G      file was merged using a merge-base found in the repository
                 C      file was merged and conflicts occurred during merge
                 D      file was deleted
                 A      file was added
                 #      failed to patch the file

                 If  a change does not match at its exact line number, attempt to apply it somewhere else in the
                 file if a good spot can be found.  Otherwise, the patch will fail to apply.

                 <b>got</b> <b>patch</b> will refuse to apply a patch if certain preconditions  are  not  met.   Files  to  be
                 deleted  must  already  be under version control, and must not have been scheduled for deletion
                 already.  Files to be added must not yet be under version  control  and  must  not  already  be
                 present  on  disk.   Files  to  be  modified  must already be under version control and may not
                 contain conflict markers.

                 If an error occurs, the <b>patch</b> operation will be aborted.  Any changes made to the work tree  up
                 to  this  point  will  be  left  behind.   Such  changes can be viewed with <b>got</b> <b>diff</b> and can be
                 reverted with <b>got</b> <b>revert</b> if needed.

                 The options for <b>got</b> <b>patch</b> are as follows:

                 <b>-c</b> <u>commit</u>
                         Attempt to locate files within the specified <u>commit</u> for use as a merge-base  for  3-way
                         merges.

                         If  the  <b>-c</b>  option  is  not used then <b>got</b> <b>patch</b> will attempt to locate merge-bases via
                         object IDs found in <u>patchfile</u> meta-data, such as produced by <b>got</b> <b>diff</b>  or  <u><a href="../man1/git-diff.1.html">git-diff</a></u>(1).
                         Use of the <b>-c</b> option is only recommended in the absence of such meta-data.

                         Ideally,  the  specified  <u>commit</u>  should  contain  versions  of files which the changes
                         contained in the <u>patchfile</u> were based on.  Files will be located by path,  relative  to
                         the  repository  root.   If  the <b>-p</b> option is used then leading path components will be
                         stripped before paths are looked up in the repository.

                         In case no merge-base is available for a file, changes will be applied without doing  a
                         3-way  merge.  Changes which do not apply cleanly may then be rejected entirely, rather
                         than producing merge conflicts in the patched target file.

                         The expected <u>commit</u> argument is a commit ID, or a reference name  or  a  keyword  which
                         will  be  resolved  to a commit ID.  An abbreviated hash argument will be expanded to a
                         full commit ID automatically,  provided  the  abbreviation  is  unique.   The  keywords
                         ":base"  and  ":head"  resolve  to  the  work  tree's  base  commit  and  branch  head,
                         respectively.  Keywords and references may be appended with ":+" or ":-" modifiers  and
                         an  optional  integer  N  to  denote  the  Nth descendant or antecedent by first parent
                         traversal, respectively; for example, <b>:head:-2</b> denotes the work tree branch head's  2nd
                         generation  ancestor,  and  <b>:base:+4</b>  denotes the 4th generation descendant of the work
                         tree's base commit.  Similarly, <b>flan:+3</b> will denote the 3rd  generation  descendant  of
                         the  commit  resolved  by  the  "flan"  reference.   A  ":+" or ":-" modifier without a
                         trailing integer  has  an  implicit  "1"  appended  (e.g.,  <b>:base:+</b>  is  equivalent  to
                         <b>:base:+1</b>).

                 <b>-n</b>      Do  not  make  any modifications to the work tree.  This can be used to check whether a
                         patch would apply without issues.  If the <u>patchfile</u> contains diffs that affect the same
                         file multiple times, the results displayed may be incorrect.

                 <b>-p</b> <u>strip-count</u>
                         Specify the number  of  leading  path  components  to  strip  from  paths  parsed  from
                         <u>patchfile</u>.   If  the  <b>-p</b>  option  is not used, ‘a/’ and ‘b/’ path prefixes generated by
                         <u><a href="../man1/git-diff.1.html">git-diff</a></u>(1) will be recognized and stripped automatically.

                 <b>-R</b>      Reverse the patch before applying it.

       <b>revert</b> [<b>-pR</b>] [<b>-F</b> <u>response-script</u>] <u>path</u> <u>...</u>
                       (alias: <b>rv</b>)
                 Revert any local changes in files at the specified paths in a work tree.  File contents will be
                 overwritten with those contained in the work tree's base commit.  There  is  no  way  to  bring
                 discarded changes back after <b>got</b> <b>revert</b>!

                 If  a  file  was  added  with <b>got</b> <b>add</b>, it will become an unversioned file again.  If a file was
                 deleted with <b>got</b> <b>remove</b>, it will be restored.

                 The options for <b>got</b> <b>revert</b> are as follows:

                 <b>-F</b> <u>response-script</u>
                         With the <b>-p</b> option, read “y”, “n”, and “q” responses line-by-line  from  the  specified
                         <u>response-script</u> file instead of prompting interactively.

                 <b>-p</b>      Instead  of  reverting  all changes in files, interactively select or reject changes to
                         revert based on “y” (revert change), “n” (keep change), and “q”  (quit  reverting  this
                         file)  responses.  If a file is in modified status, individual patches derived from the
                         modified file content can be reverted.  Files in added or deleted status  may  only  be
                         reverted in their entirety.

                 <b>-R</b>      Permit  recursion  into  directories.  If this option is not specified, <b>got</b> <b>revert</b> will
                         refuse to run if a specified <u>path</u> is a directory.

       <b>commit</b> [<b>-CNnS</b>] [<b>-A</b> <u>author</u>] [<b>-F</b> <u>path</u>] [<b>-m</b> <u>message</u>] [<u>path</u> <u>...</u>]
                       (alias: <b>ci</b>)
                 Create a new commit in the repository from changes in a work tree and use this  commit  as  the
                 new  base  commit  for  the work tree.  If no <u>path</u> is specified, commit all changes in the work
                 tree.  Otherwise, commit changes at or within the specified paths.

                 If changes have been explicitly staged for commit with <b>got</b> <b>stage</b>, only  commit  staged  changes
                 and reject any specified paths which have not been staged.

                 <b>got</b> <b>commit</b> opens a temporary file in an editor where a log message can be written unless the <b>-m</b>
                 option  is used or the <b>-F</b> and <b>-N</b> options are used together.  Quitting the editor without saving
                 the file will abort the commit operation.

                 Show the status of each affected file, using the following status codes:

                 M      modified file
                 D      file was deleted
                 A      new file was added
                 m      modified file modes (executable bit only)

                 Files which are not part of the new commit will retain their previously recorded  base  commit.
                 Some  <b>got</b>  commands  may  refuse  to  run while the work tree contains files from multiple base
                 commits.  The base commit of such a work tree can be made  consistent  by  running  <b>got</b>  <b>update</b>
                 across the entire work tree.

                 The <b>got</b> <b>commit</b> command requires the GOT_AUTHOR environment variable to be set, unless an author
                 has been configured in <u><a href="../man5/got.conf.5.html">got.conf</a></u>(5) or Git's user.name and user.email configuration settings can
                 be  obtained  from  the  repository's  <u>.git/config</u>  file  or  from  Git's  global  <u><a href="file:~/.gitconfig">~/.gitconfig</a></u>
                 configuration file.

                 The options for <b>got</b> <b>commit</b> are as follows:

                 <b>-A</b> <u>author</u>
                         Set author information in the newly created commit to  <u>author</u>.   This  is  useful  when
                         committing  changes  on  behalf of someone else.  The <u>author</u> argument must use the same
                         format as the GOT_AUTHOR environment variable.

                         In addition to storing author information, the newly created commit object will  retain
                         “committer”  information  which  is obtained, as usual, from the GOT_AUTHOR environment
                         variable, or <u><a href="../man5/got.conf.5.html">got.conf</a></u>(5), or Git configuration settings.

                 <b>-C</b>      Allow committing files in conflicted status.

                         Committing files with conflict  markers  should  generally  be  avoided.   Cases  where
                         conflict  markers must be stored in the repository for some legitimate reason should be
                         very rare.  There are usually ways  to  avoid  storing  conflict  markers  verbatim  by
                         applying appropriate programming tricks.

                 <b>-F</b> <u>path</u>
                         Use  the  prepared  log  message stored in the file found at <u>path</u> when creating the new
                         commit.  <b>got</b> <b>commit</b> opens a temporary file in an editor where the prepared log  message
                         can  be  reviewed  and  edited  further if needed.  Cannot be used together with the <b>-m</b>
                         option.

                 <b>-m</b> <u>message</u>
                         Use the specified log message when creating the new commit.  Cannot  be  used  together
                         with the <b>-F</b> option.

                 <b>-N</b>      This  option  prevents <b>got</b> <b>commit</b> from opening the commit message in an editor.  It has
                         no effect unless it is used together with the  <b>-F</b>  option  and  is  intended  for  non-
                         interactive use such as scripting.

                 <b>-n</b>      This  option  prevents <b>got</b> <b>commit</b> from generating a diff of the to-be-committed changes
                         in a temporary file which can be viewed while editing a commit message.

                 <b>-S</b>      Allow the addition of symbolic links which point outside of  the  path  space  that  is
                         under  version  control.  By default, <b>got</b> <b>commit</b> will reject such symbolic links due to
                         safety concerns.  As a precaution, <b>got</b> may decide to represent such a symbolic link  as
                         a  regular  file  which contains the link's target path, rather than creating an actual
                         symbolic link which points outside of the work tree.  Use of this option is discouraged
                         because external mechanisms such as “make obj” are better suited for managing  symbolic
                         links to paths not under version control.

                 <b>got</b> <b>commit</b> will refuse to run if certain preconditions are not met.  If the work tree's current
                 branch  is not in the “refs/heads/” reference namespace, new commits may not be created on this
                 branch.  Local changes may only be committed if they are based on file  content  found  in  the
                 most recent commit on the work tree's branch.  If a path is found to be out of date, <b>got</b> <b>update</b>
                 must be used first in order to merge local changes with changes made in the repository.

       <b>send</b>  [<b>-afqTv</b>]  [<b>-b</b>  <u>branch</u>]  [<b>-d</b>  <u>branch</u>] [<b>-i</b> <u>identity-file</u>] [<b>-J</b> <u>jumphost</u>] [<b>-r</b> <u>repository-path</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>tag</u>]
                 [<u>remote-repository</u>]
                       (alias: <b>se</b>)
                 Send new changes to a remote repository.  If no <u>remote-repository</u> is specified,  “origin”  will
                 be  used.   The remote repository's URL is obtained from the corresponding entry in <u><a href="../man5/got.conf.5.html">got.conf</a></u>(5)
                 or Git's <u>config</u> file of the local repository, as created by <b>got</b> <b>clone</b>.

                 All objects corresponding to new changes will be written to a temporary pack file which is then
                 uploaded to the server.  Upon success, references in the “refs/remotes/” reference namespace of
                 the local repository will be updated to point at the commits which have been sent.

                 By default, changes will only be sent if they  are  based  on  up-to-date  copies  of  relevant
                 branches  in  the remote repository.  If any changes to be sent are based on out-of-date copies
                 or would otherwise break linear history of existing branches, new changes must be fetched  from
                 the  server  with  <b>got</b> <b>fetch</b> and local branches must be rebased with <b>got</b> <b>rebase</b> before <b>got</b> <b>send</b>
                 can succeed.  The <b>-f</b> option can be used to make exceptions to these requirements.

                 The options for <b>got</b> <b>send</b> are as follows:

                 <b>-a</b>      Send all branches from the local repository's “refs/heads/” reference  namespace.   The
                         <b>-a</b>  option  is  equivalent to listing all branches with multiple <b>-b</b> options.  Cannot be
                         used together with the <b>-b</b> option.

                 <b>-b</b> <u>branch</u>
                         Send  the  specified  <u>branch</u>  from  the  local  repository's  “refs/heads/”   reference
                         namespace.   This option may be specified multiple times to build a list of branches to
                         send.  If this option is not specified, default to the work tree's  current  branch  if
                         invoked in a work tree, or to the repository's HEAD reference.  Cannot be used together
                         with the <b>-a</b> option.

                 <b>-d</b> <u>branch</u>
                         Delete  the  specified  <u>branch</u>  from  the  remote  repository's “refs/heads/” reference
                         namespace.  This option may be specified multiple times to build a list of branches  to
                         delete.

                         Only  references  are  deleted.   Any  commit, tree, tag, and blob objects belonging to
                         deleted branches may become subject to deletion by Git's garbage collector  running  on
                         the server.

                         Requesting deletion of branches results in an error if the server does not support this
                         feature or disallows the deletion of branches based on its configuration.

                 <b>-f</b>      Attempt  to  force  the  server  to  overwrite  existing branches or tags in the remote
                         repository, even when <b>got</b> <b>fetch</b> followed by <b>got</b> <b>rebase</b> or <b>got</b> <b>merge</b>  would  usually  be
                         required before changes can be sent.  The server may reject forced requests regardless,
                         depending on its configuration.

                         Any  commit,  tree, tag, and blob objects belonging to overwritten branches or tags may
                         become subject to deletion by Git's garbage collector running on the server.

                         The “refs/tags” reference namespace is globally shared between all  repositories.   Use
                         of   the   <b>-f</b>  option  to  overwrite  tags  is  discouraged  because  it  can  lead  to
                         inconsistencies between the  tags  present  in  different  repositories.   In  general,
                         creating  a  new  tag  with  a  different name is recommended instead of overwriting an
                         existing tag.

                         Use of the <b>-f</b> option is particularly discouraged if changes being sent are based on  an
                         out-of-date copy of a branch in the remote repository.  Instead of using the <b>-f</b> option,
                         new  changes should be fetched with <b>got</b> <b>fetch</b> and local branches should be rebased with
                         <b>got</b> <b>rebase</b> or merged with <b>got</b> <b>merge</b>, followed by another attempt to send the changes.

                         The <b>-f</b> option should only be needed in situations where the remote repository's copy of
                         a branch or tag is known to be out-of-date and is considered disposable.  The risks  of
                         creating  inconsistencies  between  different  repositories  should  also be taken into
                         account.

                 <b>-i</b> <u>identity-file</u>
                         Specify an <u>identity-file</u>, containing a private SSH key, to use  with  SSH  connections.
                         The same option will be passed to <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1).

                 <b>-J</b> <u>jumphost</u>
                         Specify  a  <u>jumphost</u>  to  use  with SSH connections.  The same option will be passed to
                         <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1).

                 <b>-q</b>      Suppress progress reporting output.  The same  option  will  be  passed  to  <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1)  if
                         applicable.

                 <b>-r</b> <u>repository-path</u>
                         Use  the  repository at the specified path.  If not specified, assume the repository is
                         located at or above the current working directory.  If this directory  is  a  <b>got</b>  work

                         The <b>-T</b> option is equivalent to listing all tags with multiple <b>-t</b>  options.   Cannot  be

                         the verbosity.  The maximum is 3.

       <b>cherrypick</b> [<b>-lX</b>] [<u>commit</u>]
                       (alias: <b>cy</b>)
                 Merge changes from a single <u>commit</u> into the work tree.  The specified <u>commit</u>  should  be  on  a
                 different branch than the work tree's base commit.

                 The  expected argument is a commit ID, or a reference name or keyword which will be resolved to
                 a commit ID.  An abbreviated hash argument will be expanded to a full commit ID  automatically,
                 provided  the  abbreviation  is  unique.   The keywords ":base" and ":head" resolve to the work
                 tree's base commit and branch head, respectively.  Keywords and references may be appended with
                 ":+" or ":-" modifiers and an optional integer N to denote the Nth descendant or antecedent  by
                 first parent traversal, respectively; for example, <b>:head:-2</b> denotes the work tree branch head's
                 2nd  generation ancestor, and <b>:base:+4</b> denotes the 4th generation descendant of the work tree's
                 base commit.  Similarly, <b>barbaz:+3</b> will denote the 3rd  generation  descendant  of  the  commit
                 resolved  by the "barbaz" reference.  A ":+" or ":-" modifier without a trailing integer has an
                 implicit "1" appended (e.g., <b>:base:+</b> is equivalent to <b>:base:+1</b>).

                 Show the status of each affected file, using the following status codes:

                 G      file was merged
                 C      file was merged and conflicts occurred during merge

                 commits will then appear in the editor, where the messages should be further adjusted to convey
                 the reasons for cherrypicking the changes.  Upon exiting the editor, if the time stamp  of  the

                 on the same branch as the work tree's base commit.

                 The  expected argument is a commit ID, or a reference name or keyword which will be resolved to
                 a commit ID.  An abbreviated hash argument will be expanded to a full commit ID  automatically,
                 provided  the  abbreviation  is  unique.   The keywords ":base" and ":head" resolve to the work

       <b>rebase</b> [<b>-aCclX</b>] [<u>branch</u>]
                       (alias: <b>rb</b>)
                 Rebase  commits  on  the  specified <u>branch</u> onto the tip of the current branch of the work tree.
                 The <u>branch</u> must share common ancestry with the work tree's  current  branch.   Rebasing  begins
                 with the first descendant commit of the youngest common ancestor commit shared by the specified
                 <u>branch</u>  and  the  work  tree's  current  branch, and stops once the tip commit of the specified
                 <u>branch</u> has been rebased.

                 When <b>got</b> <b>rebase</b> is used as intended, the specified <u>branch</u> represents a local commit history and
                 may already contain changes that are not yet visible  in  any  other  repositories.   The  work
                 tree's  current  branch,  which  must  be  set  with  <b>got</b>  <b>update</b> <b>-b</b> before starting the <b>rebase</b>
                 operation, represents a branch from a remote repository which shares a common history with  the
                 specified  <u>branch</u>  but has progressed, and perhaps diverged, due to commits added to the remote
                 repository.

                 Rebased commits are accumulated on a temporary branch which the work tree will remain  switched
                 to  throughout  the entire rebase operation.  Commits on this branch represent the same changes
                 with the same log messages as their counterparts on the original  <u>branch</u>,  but  with  different
                 commit  IDs.   Once  rebasing  has completed successfully, the temporary branch becomes the new
                 version of the specified <u>branch</u> and the work tree is automatically switched to it.   If  author
                 information  is  available  via  the  GOT_AUTHOR  environment  variable,  <u><a href="../man5/got.conf.5.html">got.conf</a></u>(5)  or Git's
                 user.name and user.email configuration settings,  this  author  information  will  be  used  to
                 identify the “committer” of rebased commits.

                 Old    commits   in   their   pre-rebase   state   are   automatically   backed   up   in   the
                 “refs/got/backup/rebase” reference namespace.  As long as  these  references  are  not  removed
                 older  versions of rebased commits will remain in the repository and can be viewed with the <b>got</b>
                 <b>rebase</b> <b>-l</b> command.  Removal of these references makes objects which become unreachable via  any
                 reference subject to removal by Git's garbage collector or <b>gotadmin</b> <b>cleanup</b>.

                 While  rebasing  commits,  show  the  status  of each affected file, using the following status
                 codes:

                 G      file was merged
                 C      file was merged and conflicts occurred during merge
                 !      changes destined for a missing file were not merged
                 D      file was deleted
                 d      file's deletion was prevented by local modifications
                 A      new file was added
                 ~      changes destined for a non-regular file were not merged
                 ?      changes destined for an unversioned file were not merged

                 If merge conflicts occur, the rebase  operation  is  interrupted  and  may  be  continued  once
                 conflicts  have  been  resolved.  If any files with destined changes are found to be missing or
                 unversioned, or if files could not be deleted due to differences in deleted content, the rebase
                 operation will be interrupted to prevent potentially incomplete changes from being committed to
                 the repository without user intervention.  The work tree may be modified  as  desired  and  the
                 rebase  operation  can  be  continued  once the changes present in the work tree are considered
                 complete.  Alternatively,  the  rebase  operation  may  be  aborted  which  will  leave  <u>branch</u>
                 unmodified and the work tree switched back to its original branch.

                 If  a  merge conflict is resolved in a way which renders the merged change into a no-op change,
                 the corresponding commit will be elided when the rebase operation continues.

                 <b>got</b> <b>rebase</b> will refuse to run if certain preconditions are not met.  If the <u>branch</u>  is  not  in
                 the  “refs/heads/” reference namespace, the branch may not be rebased.  If the work tree is not
                 yet fully updated to the tip commit of its branch, then the work tree  must  first  be  updated
                 with  <b>got</b>  <b>update</b>.   If  changes  have  been staged with <b>got</b> <b>stage</b>, these changes must first be
                 committed with <b>got</b> <b>commit</b> or unstaged with <b>got</b>  <b>unstage</b>.   If  the  work  tree  contains  local
                 changes, these changes must first be committed with <b>got</b> <b>commit</b> or reverted with <b>got</b> <b>revert</b>.  If
                 the  <u>branch</u>  contains  changes  to  files outside of the work tree's path prefix, the work tree
                 cannot be used to rebase this branch.

                 The <b>got</b> <b>update</b>, <b>got</b> <b>integrate</b>, <b>got</b> <b>merge</b>, <b>got</b> <b>commit</b>, and <b>got</b> <b>histedit</b> commands will refuse  to
                 run while a rebase operation is in progress.  Other commands which manipulate the work tree may
                 be used for conflict resolution purposes.

                 If  the  specified  <u>branch</u>  is already based on the work tree's current branch, then no commits
                 need to be rebased and <b>got</b> <b>rebase</b> will simply switch the work tree to the specified <u>branch</u>  and
                 update files in the work tree accordingly.

                 The options for <b>got</b> <b>rebase</b> are as follows:

                 <b>-a</b>      Abort  an  interrupted rebase operation.  If this option is used, no other command-line
                         arguments are allowed.

                 <b>-C</b>      Allow a rebase operation to continue with files  in  conflicted  status.   This  option
                         should generally be avoided, and can only be used with the <b>-c</b> option.

                 <b>-c</b>      Continue  an  interrupted  rebase operation.  If this option is used, no other command-
                         line arguments are allowed except <b>-C</b>.

                 <b>-l</b>      Show  a  list  of  past  rebase  operations,   represented   by   references   in   the
                         “refs/got/backup/rebase” reference namespace.

                         Display  the  author,  date, and log message of each backed up commit, the object ID of
                         the corresponding post-rebase commit, and  the  object  ID  of  their  common  ancestor
                         commit.   Given these object IDs, the <b>got</b> <b>log</b> command with the <b>-c</b> and <b>-x</b> options can be
                         used to examine the history of either version of the branch, and the <b>got</b> <b>branch</b> command
                         with the <b>-c</b> option can be used to create a  new  branch  from  a  pre-rebase  state  if
                         desired.

                         If  a  <u>branch</u>  is  specified, only show commits which at some point in time represented
                         this branch.  Otherwise, list all backed up commits for any branches.

                         If this option is used, <b>got</b> <b>rebase</b> does not require a work tree.   None  of  the  other
                         options can be used together with <b>-l</b>.

                 <b>-X</b>      Delete  backups  created  by  past  rebase operations, represented by references in the
                         “refs/got/backup/rebase” reference namespace.

                         If a <u>branch</u> is specified, only delete backups which at some point in  time  represented
                         this branch.  Otherwise, delete all references found within “refs/got/backup/rebase”.

                         Any  commit,  tree,  tag,  and  blob objects belonging to deleted backups remain in the
                         repository and may be removed separately  with  Git's  garbage  collector  or  <b>gotadmin</b>
                         <b>cleanup</b>.

                         If  this  option  is  used, <b>got</b> <b>rebase</b> does not require a work tree.  None of the other
                         options can be used together with <b>-X</b>.

       <b>histedit</b> [<b>-aCcdeflmX</b>] [<b>-F</b> <u>histedit-script</u>] [<u>branch</u>]
                       (alias: <b>he</b>)
                 Edit commit history between the work tree's current base commit and the tip commit of the  work
                 tree's current branch.

                 The  <b>got</b>  <b>histedit</b>  command  requires  the GOT_AUTHOR environment variable to be set, unless an
                 author has been configured in <u><a href="../man5/got.conf.5.html">got.conf</a></u>(5)  or  Git's  user.name  and  user.email  configuration
                 settings  can  be  obtained  from  the  repository's  <u>.git/config</u>  file  or  from  Git's global
                 <u><a href="file:~/.gitconfig">~/.gitconfig</a></u> configuration file.

                 Before starting a <b>histedit</b> operation, the work tree's current  branch  must  be  set  with  <b>got</b>
                 <b>update</b>  <b>-b</b>  to  the  branch  which  should be edited, unless this branch is already the current
                 branch of the work tree.  The tip of this branch represents  the  upper  bound  (inclusive)  of
                 commits touched by the <b>histedit</b> operation.

                 Furthermore,  the  work  tree's  base  commit must be set with <b>got</b> <b>update</b> <b>-c</b> to a point in this
                 branch's commit history where editing should begin.  This commit  represents  the  lower  bound
                 (non-inclusive) of commits touched by the <b>histedit</b> operation.

                 Editing of commit history is controlled via a <u>histedit</u> <u>script</u> which can be written in an editor
                 based  on  a  template,  passed  on  the  command line, or generated with the <b>-d</b>, <b>-e</b>, <b>-f</b>, or <b>-m</b>
                 options.  Quitting the editor without saving the file will abort the histedit operation.

                 The format of the histedit script is line-based.  Each line in the script begins with a command
                 name, followed by whitespace and an argument.  For most commands, the expected  argument  is  a
                 commit  ID.   Any  remaining  text  on  the  line  is  ignored.  Lines which begin with the ‘#’
                 character are ignored entirely.

                 The available histedit script commands are as follows:

                 <b>pick</b> <u>commit</u>           Use the specified commit as it is.
                 <b>edit</b> <u>commit</u>           Apply the changes from the  specified  commit,  but  then  interrupt  the
                                       histedit  operation  for  amending, without creating a commit.  While the
                                       histedit operation is interrupted arbitrary  files  may  be  edited,  and
                                       commands  which manipulate the work tree can be used freely.  The <b>got</b> <b>add</b>
                                       and <b>got</b> <b>remove</b> commands can be used to add new files or  remove  existing
                                       ones.   The  <b>got</b>  <b>revert</b>  <b>-p</b>  command  can be used to eliminate arbitrary
                                       changes from files in the work tree.  The <b>got</b> <b>stage</b>  <b>-p</b>  command  may  be
                                       used  to  prepare  a  subset of changes for inclusion in the next commit.
                                       Finally, the <b>got</b> <b>commit</b> command can be used to insert  arbitrary  commits
                                       into  the  edited history.  Regular editing of history must eventually be
                                       resumed by running <b>got</b> <b>histedit</b> <b>-c</b>.
                 <b>fold</b> <u>commit</u>           Combine the specified commit with the next commit  listed  further  below
                                       that will be used.
                 <b>drop</b> <u>commit</u>           Remove this commit from the edited history.
                 <b>mesg</b> <u>commit</u>           Open an editor to create a new log message for this commit.

                 Every  commit  in  the  history being edited must be mentioned in the script.  Lines may be re-
                 ordered to change the order of commits in the edited history.  No commit  may  be  listed  more
                 than once.

                 Edited  commits  are accumulated on a temporary branch which the work tree will remain switched
                 to throughout the entire histedit operation.  Once history editing has completed  successfully,
                 the  temporary  branch  becomes  the new version of the work tree's branch and the work tree is
                 automatically switched to it.

                 Old  commits   in   their   pre-histedit   state   are   automatically   backed   up   in   the
                 “refs/got/backup/histedit”  reference  namespace.   As long as these references are not removed
                 older versions of edited commits will remain in the repository and can be viewed with  the  <b>got</b>
                 <b>histedit</b>  <b>-l</b>  command.   Removal of these references makes objects which become unreachable via
                 any reference subject to removal by Git's garbage collector or <b>gotadmin</b> <b>cleanup</b>.

                 While merging commits, show the status of each affected file, using the following status codes:

                 G      file was merged
                 C      file was merged and conflicts occurred during merge
                 !      changes destined for a missing file were not merged
                 D      file was deleted
                 d      file's deletion was prevented by local modifications
                 A      new file was added
                 ~      changes destined for a non-regular file were not merged
                 ?      changes destined for an unversioned file were not merged

                 If merge conflicts occur, the histedit operation is  interrupted  and  may  be  continued  once
                 conflicts  have  been  resolved.  If any files with destined changes are found to be missing or
                 unversioned, or if files could not be deleted  due  to  differences  in  deleted  content,  the
                 histedit  operation  will  be  interrupted to prevent potentially incomplete changes from being
                 committed to the repository without user intervention.   The  work  tree  may  be  modified  as
                 desired  and  the histedit operation can be continued once the changes present in the work tree
                 are considered complete.  Alternatively, the histedit operation may be aborted which will leave
                 the work tree switched back to its original branch.

                 If a merge conflict is resolved in a way which renders the merged change into a  no-op  change,
                 the corresponding commit will be elided when the histedit operation continues.

                 <b>got</b>  <b>histedit</b>  will  refuse  to  run  if certain preconditions are not met.  If the work tree's
                 current branch is not in the “refs/heads/” reference namespace, the history of the  branch  may
                 not  be edited.  If the work tree contains multiple base commits, it must first be updated to a
                 single base commit with <b>got</b> <b>update</b>.  If changes have been staged with <b>got</b> <b>stage</b>, these  changes
                 must  first  be  committed  with  <b>got</b>  <b>commit</b>  or  unstaged with <b>got</b> <b>unstage</b>.  If the work tree
                 contains local changes, these changes must first be committed with <b>got</b> <b>commit</b> or reverted  with
                 <b>got</b>  <b>revert</b>.   If  the edited history contains changes to files outside of the work tree's path
                 prefix, the work tree cannot be used to edit the history of this branch.

                 The <b>got</b> <b>update</b>, <b>got</b> <b>rebase</b>, <b>got</b> <b>merge</b>, and <b>got</b> <b>integrate</b> commands will refuse to  run  while  a
                 histedit  operation is in progress.  Other commands which manipulate the work tree may be used,
                 and the <b>got</b> <b>commit</b> command may be used to commit arbitrary  changes  to  the  temporary  branch
                 while the histedit operation is interrupted.

                 The options for <b>got</b> <b>histedit</b> are as follows:

                 <b>-a</b>      Abort an interrupted histedit operation.  If this option is used, no other command-line
                         arguments are allowed.

                 <b>-C</b>      Allow  a  histedit  operation to continue with files in conflicted status.  This option
                         should generally be avoided, and can only be used with the <b>-c</b> option.

                 <b>-c</b>      Continue an interrupted histedit operation.  If this option is used, no other  command-
                         line arguments are allowed except <b>-C</b>.

                 <b>-d</b>      Drop  all  commits.  This option is a quick equivalent to a histedit script which drops
                         all commits.  The <b>-d</b> option can only be used when starting a  new  histedit  operation.
                         If this option is used, no other command-line arguments are allowed.

                 <b>-e</b>      Interrupt the histedit operation for editing after merging each commit.  This option is
                         a  quick  equivalent  to a histedit script which uses the <b>edit</b> command for all commits.
                         The <b>-e</b> option can only be used when starting a new histedit operation.  If this  option
                         is used, no other command-line arguments are allowed.

                 <b>-F</b> <u>histedit-script</u>
                         Use  the  specified  <u>histedit-script</u>  instead  of opening a temporary file in an editor
                         where a histedit script can be written.

                 <b>-f</b>      Fold all commits into a single commit.  This option is a quick equivalent to a histedit
                         script which folds all commits, combining them all into one commit.  The <b>-f</b> option  can
                         only  be used when starting a new histedit operation.  If this option is used, no other
                         command-line arguments are allowed.

                 <b>-l</b>      Show  a  list  of  past  histedit  operations,  represented  by   references   in   the
                         “refs/got/backup/histedit” reference namespace.

                         Display  the  author,  date, and log message of each backed up commit, the object ID of
                         the corresponding post-histedit commit, and the object  ID  of  their  common  ancestor
                         commit.   Given these object IDs, the <b>got</b> <b>log</b> command with the <b>-c</b> and <b>-x</b> options can be
                         used to examine the history of either version of the branch, and the <b>got</b> <b>branch</b> command
                         with the <b>-c</b> option can be used to create a new branch  from  a  pre-histedit  state  if
                         desired.

                         If  a  <u>branch</u>  is  specified, only show commits which at some point in time represented
                         this branch.  Otherwise, list all backed up commits for any branches.

                         If this option is used, <b>got</b> <b>histedit</b> does not require a work tree.  None of  the  other
                         options can be used together with <b>-l</b>.

                 <b>-m</b>      Edit  log  messages only.  This option is a quick equivalent to a histedit script which
                         edits only log messages but otherwise leaves every picked commit as-is.  The <b>-m</b>  option
                         can  only  be  used when starting a new histedit operation.  If this option is used, no
                         other command-line arguments are allowed.

                 <b>-X</b>      Delete backups created by past histedit operations, represented by  references  in  the
                         “refs/got/backup/histedit” reference namespace.

                         If  a  <u>branch</u> is specified, only delete backups which at some point in time represented
                         this branch.  Otherwise, delete all references found within “refs/got/backup/histedit”.

                         Any commit, tree, tag, and blob objects belonging to  deleted  backups  remain  in  the
                         repository  and  may  be  removed  separately  with Git's garbage collector or <b>gotadmin</b>
                         <b>cleanup</b>.

                         If this option is used, <b>got</b> <b>histedit</b> does not require a work tree.  None of  the  other
                         options can be used together with <b>-X</b>.

       <b>integrate</b> <u>branch</u>
                       (alias: <b>ig</b>)
                 Integrate the specified <u>branch</u> into the work tree's current branch.  Files in the work tree are
                 updated  to  match  the contents on the integrated <u>branch</u>, and the reference of the work tree's
                 branch is changed to point at the head commit of the integrated <u>branch</u>.

                 Both branches can be considered equivalent after integration since they will be pointing at the
                 same commit.  Both branches remain  available  for  future  work,  if  desired.   In  case  the
                 integrated <u>branch</u> is no longer needed it may be deleted with <b>got</b> <b>branch</b> <b>-d</b>.

                 Show the status of each affected file, using the following status codes:

                 U      file was updated
                 D      file was deleted
                 A      new file was added
                 ~      versioned file is obstructed by a non-regular file
                 !      a missing versioned file was restored

                 <b>got</b>  <b>integrate</b>  will refuse to run if certain preconditions are not met.  Most importantly, the
                 <u>branch</u> must have been rebased onto the work tree's current branch with <b>got</b> <b>rebase</b> before it can
                 be integrated, in order to linearize commit history and resolve merge conflicts.  If  the  work
                 tree  contains multiple base commits, it must first be updated to a single base commit with <b>got</b>
                 <b>update</b>.  If changes have been staged with <b>got</b> <b>stage</b>, these changes must first be committed with
                 <b>got</b> <b>commit</b> or unstaged with <b>got</b> <b>unstage</b>.  If  the  work  tree  contains  local  changes,  these
                 changes must first be committed with <b>got</b> <b>commit</b> or reverted with <b>got</b> <b>revert</b>.

       <b>merge</b> [<b>-aCcMn</b>] [<u>branch</u>]
                       (alias: <b>mg</b>)
                 Merge  the  specified  <u>branch</u>  into  the current branch of the work tree.  If the branches have
                 diverged, merge changes into the work tree and  create  a  merge  commit.   Otherwise,  if  the
                 specified  <u>branch</u>  is  already  based  on  the work tree's current branch, make the work tree's
                 current branch  equivalent  to  the  specified  <u>branch</u>  and  update  files  in  the  work  tree
                 accordingly.

                 Merge  commits are commits based on multiple parent commits.  The tip commit of the work tree's
                 current branch will be used as the first parent.  The tip commit of the specified  <u>branch</u>  will
                 be  used  as  the  second  parent.  The work tree's current branch must be in the “refs/heads/”
                 reference namespace and can be set with <b>got</b> <b>update</b> <b>-b</b> before starting the <b>merge</b> operation.

                 No ancestral relationship between the two branches is  required.   If  the  two  branches  have
                 already been merged previously, only new changes will be merged.

                 It is not possible to create merge commits with more than two parents.  If more than one branch
                 needs  to  be  merged,  then  multiple  merge  commits  with two parents each can be created in
                 sequence.

                 If a linear project history is desired, then use of <b>got</b> <b>rebase</b> should  generally  be  preferred
                 over  <b>got</b>  <b>merge</b>.  However, even strictly linear projects may require occasional merge commits,
                 for example in order to merge in new versions of third-party code stored on  “vendor”  branches
                 created with <b>got</b> <b>import</b>.

                 While  merging changes found on the <u>branch</u> into the work tree, show the status of each affected
                 file, using the following status codes:

                 U      file was updated
                 G      file was merged
                 C      file was merged and conflicts occurred during merge
                 !      changes destined for a missing file were not merged
                 D      file was deleted
                 d      file's deletion was prevented by local modifications
                 A      new file was added
                 ~      changes destined for a non-regular file were not merged
                 ?      changes destined for an unversioned file were not merged

                 If merge conflicts occur, the merge operation is interrupted and  conflicts  must  be  resolved
                 before  the  merge  operation can continue.  If any files with destined changes are found to be
                 missing or unversioned, or if files could not be deleted due to differences in deleted content,
                 the merge operation will be interrupted to prevent potentially incomplete  changes  from  being
                 committed  to  the  repository  without  user  intervention.   The work tree may be modified as
                 desired and the merge can be continued once the changes present in the work tree are considered
                 complete.  Alternatively, the merge operation may be aborted which will leave the  work  tree's
                 current branch unmodified.

                 <b>got</b>  <b>merge</b> will refuse to run if certain preconditions are not met.  If the work tree's current
                 branch is not in the “refs/heads/” reference  namespace  then  the  work  tree  must  first  be
                 switched  to  a  branch in the “refs/heads/” namespace with <b>got</b> <b>update</b> <b>-b</b>.  If the work tree is
                 not yet fully updated to the tip commit of its branch, then the work tree must first be updated
                 with <b>got</b> <b>update</b>.  If the work tree contains multiple base commits, it must first be updated  to
                 a  single  base  commit  with  <b>got</b>  <b>update</b>.   If changes have been staged with <b>got</b> <b>stage</b>, these
                 changes must first be committed with <b>got</b> <b>commit</b> or unstaged with <b>got</b> <b>unstage</b>.  If the work tree
                 contains local changes, these changes must first be committed with <b>got</b> <b>commit</b> or reverted  with
                 <b>got</b>  <b>revert</b>.   If  the <u>branch</u> contains changes to files outside of the work tree's path prefix,
                 the work tree cannot be used to merge this branch.

                 The <b>got</b> <b>update</b>, <b>got</b> <b>commit</b>, <b>got</b> <b>rebase</b>, <b>got</b> <b>histedit</b>, <b>got</b> <b>integrate</b>,  and  <b>got</b>  <b>stage</b>  commands
                 will refuse to run while a merge operation is in progress.  Other commands which manipulate the
                 work tree may be used for conflict resolution purposes.

                 The options for <b>got</b> <b>merge</b> are as follows:

                 <b>-a</b>      Abort  an  interrupted  merge operation.  If this option is used, no other command-line
                         arguments are allowed.

                 <b>-C</b>      Allow a merge operation to continue with  files  in  conflicted  status.   This  option
                         should generally be avoided, and can only be used with the <b>-c</b> option.

                 <b>-c</b>      Continue an interrupted merge operation.  If this option is used, no other command-line
                         arguments are allowed except <b>-C</b>.

                 <b>-M</b>      Create a merge commit even if the branches have not diverged.

                 <b>-n</b>      Merge changes into the work tree as usual but do not create a merge commit immediately.
                         The  merge  result can be adjusted as desired before a merge commit is created with <b>got</b>
                         <b>merge</b> <b>-c</b>.  Alternatively, the merge may be aborted with <b>got</b> <b>merge</b> <b>-a</b>.

       <b>stage</b> [<b>-lpS</b>] [<b>-F</b> <u>response-script</u>] [<u>path</u> <u>...</u>]
                       (alias: <b>sg</b>)
                 Stage local changes for inclusion in the next commit.  If  no  <u>path</u>  is  specified,  stage  all
                 changes  in  the  work tree.  Otherwise, stage changes at or within the specified paths.  Paths
                 may be staged if they are added, modified, or deleted according to <b>got</b> <b>status</b>.

                 Show the status of each affected file, using the following status codes:

                 A      file addition has been staged
                 M      file modification has been staged
                 D      file deletion has been staged

                 Staged file contents are saved in newly created blob objects in the  repository.   These  blobs
                 will be referred to by tree objects once staged changes have been committed.

                 Staged  changes affect the behaviour of <b>got</b> <b>commit</b>, <b>got</b> <b>status</b>, and <b>got</b> <b>diff</b>.  While paths with
                 staged changes exist, the <b>got</b> <b>commit</b> command will refuse to commit any paths which do not  have
                 staged  changes.   Local  changes created on top of staged changes can only be committed if the
                 path is staged again, or if the staged changes are committed first.   The  <b>got</b>  <b>status</b>  command
                 will show both local changes and staged changes.  The <b>got</b> <b>diff</b> command is able to display local
                 changes  relative  to staged changes, and to display staged changes relative to the repository.
                 The <b>got</b> <b>revert</b> command cannot revert staged changes but may be used  to  revert  local  changes
                 created on top of staged changes.

                 The options for <b>got</b> <b>stage</b> are as follows:

                 <b>-F</b> <u>response-script</u>
                         With  the  <b>-p</b>  option, read “y”, “n”, and “q” responses line-by-line from the specified
                         <u>response-script</u> file instead of prompting interactively.

                 <b>-l</b>      Instead of staging new changes, list paths which are already staged, along with the IDs
                         of staged blob objects and stage status codes.  If paths were provided on  the  command
                         line,  show  the  staged  paths  among the specified paths.  Otherwise, show all staged
                         paths.

                 <b>-p</b>      Instead of staging the entire content of a changed file, interactively select or reject
                         changes for staging based on “y” (stage change), “n” (reject  change),  and  “q”  (quit
                         staging  this  file)  responses.   If  a file is in modified status, individual patches
                         derived from the modified file content can be staged.  Files in added or deleted status
                         may only be staged or rejected in their entirety.

                 <b>-S</b>      Allow staging of symbolic links which point outside of the path  space  that  is  under
                         version  control.   By default, <b>got</b> <b>stage</b> will reject such symbolic links due to safety
                         concerns.  As a precaution, <b>got</b> may decide to represent  such  a  symbolic  link  as  a
                         regular  file  which  contains  the  link's target path, rather than creating an actual
                         symbolic link which points outside of the work tree.  Use of this option is discouraged
                         because external mechanisms such as “make obj” are better suited for managing  symbolic
                         links to paths not under version control.

                 <b>got</b>  <b>stage</b>  will  refuse to run if certain preconditions are not met.  If a file contains merge
                 conflicts, these conflicts must be resolved first.  If a file  is  found  to  be  out  of  date
                 relative  to  the  head commit on the work tree's current branch, the file must be updated with
                 <b>got</b> <b>update</b> before it can be staged (however, this does not prevent the file from becoming  out-
                 of-date at some point after having been staged).

                 The  <b>got</b>  <b>update</b>,  <b>got</b>  <b>rebase</b>,  <b>got</b>  <b>merge</b>, and <b>got</b> <b>histedit</b> commands will refuse to run while
                 staged changes exist.  If staged changes cannot be committed because a staged path  is  out  of
                 date,  the path must be unstaged with <b>got</b> <b>unstage</b> before it can be updated with <b>got</b> <b>update</b>, and
                 may then be staged again if necessary.

       <b>unstage</b> [<b>-p</b>] [<b>-F</b> <u>response-script</u>] [<u>path</u> <u>...</u>]
                       (alias: <b>ug</b>)
                 Merge staged changes back into the work tree  and  put  affected  paths  back  into  non-staged
                 status.   If  no  <u>path</u>  is  specified,  unstage all staged changes across the entire work tree.
                 Otherwise, unstage changes at or within the specified paths.

                 Show the status of each affected file, using the following status codes:

                 G      file was unstaged
                 C      file was unstaged and conflicts occurred during merge
                 !      changes destined for a missing file were not merged
                 D      file was staged as deleted and still is deleted
                 d      file's deletion was prevented by local modifications
                 ~      changes destined for a non-regular file were not merged

                 The options for <b>got</b> <b>unstage</b> are as follows:

                 <b>-F</b> <u>response-script</u>
                         With the <b>-p</b> option, read “y”, “n”, and “q” responses line-by-line  from  the  specified
                         <u>response-script</u> file instead of prompting interactively.

                 <b>-p</b>      Instead  of  unstaging  the  entire  content of a changed file, interactively select or
                         reject changes for unstaging based on “y” (unstage change), “n” (keep  change  staged),
                         and  “q” (quit unstaging this file) responses.  If a file is staged in modified status,
                         individual patches derived from the staged file content can be unstaged.  Files  staged
                         in added or deleted status may only be unstaged in their entirety.

       <b>cat</b> [<b>-P</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>commit</u>] [<b>-r</b> <u>repository-path</u>] <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>
                 Parse and print contents of objects to standard output in a line-based text format.  Content of
                 commit,  tree, and tag objects is printed in a way similar to the actual content stored in such
                 objects.  Blob object contents are printed as they would appear in files on disk.

                 Attempt to interpret each argument as a reference, a tag name, or  an  object  ID.   References
                 will  be  resolved  to  an object ID.  Tag names will resolved to a tag object.  An abbreviated
                 hash argument will be expanded to a full commit ID automatically, provided the abbreviation  is
                 unique.

                 If  none  of  the  above  interpretations  produce a valid result, or if the <b>-P</b> option is used,
                 attempt to interpret the argument as a path which will be resolved to the ID of an object found
                 at this path in the repository.

                 The options for <b>got</b> <b>cat</b> are as follows:

                 <b>-c</b> <u>commit</u>
                         Look up paths in the specified <u>commit</u>.  If this option is not used, paths are looked up
                         in the commit resolved via the repository's HEAD reference.

                         The expected argument is a commit ID, or a reference name  or  keyword  which  will  be
                         resolved  to  a  commit  ID.   An  abbreviated hash argument will be expanded to a full
                         commit ID automatically, provided the abbreviation is unique.  The keywords ":base" and
                         ":head" resolve to the work tree's base commit  and  branch  head,  respectively.   The
                         former  is  only  valid if invoked in a work tree, while the latter will resolve to the
                         tip of the work tree's current branch if invoked in a  work  tree,  otherwise  it  will
                         resolve  to  the  repository's HEAD reference.  Keywords and references may be appended
                         with ":+" or ":-" modifiers and an optional integer N to denote the Nth  descendant  or
                         antecedent  by  first parent traversal, respectively; for example, <b>:head:-2</b> denotes the
                         work tree  branch  head's  2nd  generation  ancestor,  and  <b>:base:+4</b>  denotes  the  4th
                         generation  descendant  of the work tree's base commit.  Similarly, <b>quux:-8</b> will denote
                         the 8th generation ancestor of the commit resolved by the "quux" reference.  A ":+"  or
                         ":-" modifier without a trailing integer has an implicit "1" appended (e.g., <b>:base:+</b> is
                         equivalent to <b>:base:+1</b>).

                 <b>-P</b>      Interpret all arguments as paths only.  This option can be used to resolve ambiguity in
                         cases where paths look like tag names, reference names, or object IDs.

                 <b>-r</b> <u>repository-path</u>
                         Use  the  repository at the specified path.  If not specified, assume the repository is
                         located at or above the current working directory.  If this directory  is  a  <b>got</b>  work
                         tree, use the repository path associated with this work tree.

       <b>info</b> [<u>path</u> <u>...</u>]
                 Display meta-data stored in a work tree.  See <u><a href="../man5/got-worktree.5.html">got-worktree</a></u>(5) for details.

                 The  work  tree  to  use  is  resolved  implicitly  by walking upwards from the current working
                 directory.

                 If one or more <u>path</u> arguments are specified, show additional per-file information  for  tracked
                 files located at or within these paths.  If a <u>path</u> argument corresponds to the work tree's root
                 directory, display information for all tracked files.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       GOT_AUTHOR            The    author's    name    and    email    address,    such    as    "Flan   Hacker

                             <b>merge</b>, and <b>got</b> <b>histedit</b> commands.  Because <u><a href="../man1/git.1.html">git</a></u>(1) may fail to parse commits without
                             an  email  address  in  author  data, <b>got</b> attempts to reject GOT_AUTHOR environment
                             variables with a missing email address.

                             GOT_AUTHOR will be overridden by configuration settings in <u><a href="../man5/got.conf.5.html">got.conf</a></u>(5) or by  Git's

                             information found in Git configuration files will be ignored.

       GOT_LOG_DEFAULT_LIMIT
                             The default limit on the number of commits traversed by <b>got</b> <b>log</b>.  If set  to  zero,

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>got</b> utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Enable tab-completion of <b>got</b> command names in <u><a href="../man1/ksh.1.html">ksh</a></u>(1):

             <b>$</b> <b>set</b> <b>-A</b> <b>complete_got_1</b> <b>--</b> <b>$(got</b> <b>-h</b> <b>2&gt;&amp;1</b> | <b>sed</b> <b>-n</b> <b>s/commands://p)</b>

       Clone an existing Git repository for use with <b>got</b>:

             <b>$</b> <b>cd</b> <b>/var/git/</b>
             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>clone</b> <b>ssh://<a href="mailto:git@github.com">git@github.com</a>/openbsd/src.git</b>

       Unfortunately,  many  of the popular Git hosting sites do not offer anonymous access via SSH.  Such sites
       will require an account to be created, and a public SSH key  to  be  uploaded  to  this  account,  before
       repository access via ssh:// URLs will work.

       Most sites offer anonymous repository access via HTTPS:

             <b>$</b> <b>cd</b> <b>/var/git/</b>
             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>clone</b> <b>https://github.com/openbsd/src.git</b>

       Alternatively,  for  quick  and  dirty  local  testing  of  <b>got</b> a new Git repository could be created and
       populated with files, e.g. from a temporary CVS checkout located at <u>/tmp/src</u>:

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>init</b> <b>/var/git/src.git</b>
             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>import</b> <b>-r</b> <b>/var/git/src.git</b> <b>-I</b> <b>CVS</b> <b>-I</b> <b>obj</b> <b>/tmp/src</b>

       Check out a work tree from the Git repository to <a href="file:/usr/src">/usr/src</a>:

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>checkout</b> <b>/var/git/src.git</b> <b><a href="file:/usr/src">/usr/src</a></b>

       View local changes in a work tree directory:

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>diff</b> | <b>less</b>

       In a work tree, display files in a potentially problematic state:

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>status</b> <b>-s</b> <b>'C!~?'</b>

       Interactively revert selected local changes in a work tree directory:

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>revert</b> <b>-p</b> <b>-R</b> <b>.</b>

       In a work tree or a git repository directory, list all branch references:

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>branch</b> <b>-l</b>

       As above, but list the most recently modified branches only:

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>branch</b> <b>-lt</b> | <b>head</b>

       In a work tree or a git repository directory, create a new branch called “unified-buffer-cache” which  is
       forked off the “master” branch:

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>branch</b> <b>-c</b> <b>master</b> <b>unified-buffer-cache</b>

       Switch  an  existing work tree to the branch “unified-buffer-cache”.  Local changes in the work tree will
       be preserved and merged if necessary:

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>update</b> <b>-b</b> <b>unified-buffer-cache</b>

       Create a new commit from local changes in a work tree directory.  This new commit will  become  the  head
       commit of the work tree's current branch:

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>commit</b>

       In  a work tree or a git repository directory, view changes committed in the 3 most recent commits to the
       work tree's branch, or the branch resolved via the repository's HEAD reference, respectively:

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>log</b> <b>-p</b> <b>-l</b> <b>3</b>

       As above, but display changes in the order in which <u><a href="../man1/patch.1.html">patch</a></u>(1) could apply them in sequence:

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>log</b> <b>-p</b> <b>-l</b> <b>3</b> <b>-R</b>

       In a work tree or a git repository directory, log the history of a subdirectory:

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>log</b> <b>sys/uvm</b>

       While operating inside a work tree, paths are specified relative to the  current  working  directory,  so
       this command will log the subdirectory <u>sys/uvm</u>:

             <b>$</b> <b>cd</b> <b>sys/uvm</b> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>got</b> <b>log</b> <b>.</b>

       And this command has the same effect:

             <b>$</b> <b>cd</b> <b>sys/dev/usb</b> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>got</b> <b>log</b> <b>../../uvm</b>

       And this command displays work tree meta-data about all tracked files:

             <b>$</b> <b>cd</b> <b><a href="file:/usr/src">/usr/src</a></b>
             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>info</b> <b>.</b> | <b>less</b>

       Add new files and remove obsolete files in a work tree directory:

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>add</b> <b>sys/uvm/uvm_ubc.c</b>
             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>remove</b> <b>sys/uvm/uvm_vnode.c</b>

       A file can be renamed or moved by removing it from its old location and adding it at the new location:

             <b>$</b> <b>cp</b> <b>oldfile.c</b> <b>newfile.c</b>
             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>remove</b> <b>oldfile.c</b>
             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>add</b> <b>newfile.c</b>

       <b>got</b> does not yet follow file history across renames, but <u><a href="../man1/git.1.html">git</a></u>(1) will be able to do so regardless.

       Create a new commit from local changes in a work tree directory with a pre-defined log message.

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>commit</b> <b>-m</b> <b>'unify</b> <b>the</b> <b>buffer</b> <b>cache'</b>

       Alternatively,  create  a  new commit from local changes in a work tree directory with a log message that
       has been prepared in the file <u>/tmp/msg</u>:

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>commit</b> <b>-F</b> <b>/tmp/msg</b>

       Update any work tree checked out from the “unified-buffer-cache” branch to  the  latest  commit  on  this
       branch:

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>update</b>

       Roll  file  content on the unified-buffer-cache branch back by one commit, and then fetch the rolled-back
       change into the work tree as a local change to be amended and perhaps committed again:

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>backout</b> <b>unified-buffer-cache</b>
             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>commit</b> <b>-m</b> <b>'roll</b> <b>back</b> <b>previous'</b>
             <b>$</b> <b>#</b> <b>now</b> <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>backout</b> <b>:-)</b>
             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>backout</b> <b>unified-buffer-cache</b>

       Fetch new changes on  the  remote  repository's  “master”  branch,  making  them  visible  on  the  local
       repository's “origin/master” branch:

             <b>$</b> <b>cd</b> <b><a href="file:/usr/src">/usr/src</a></b>
             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>fetch</b>

       Rebase  the  local  “master”  branch to merge the new changes that are now visible on the “origin/master”
       branch:

             <b>$</b> <b>cd</b> <b><a href="file:/usr/src">/usr/src</a></b>
             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>update</b> <b>-b</b> <b>origin/master</b>
             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>rebase</b> <b>master</b>

       Rebase the “unified-buffer-cache” branch on top of the new head commit of the “master” branch.

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>update</b> <b>-b</b> <b>master</b>
             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>rebase</b> <b>unified-buffer-cache</b>

       Create a patch from all changes on the unified-buffer-cache branch.  The patch  can  be  mailed  out  for
       review and applied to OpenBSD's CVS tree:

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>diff</b> <b>master</b> <b>unified-buffer-cache</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>/tmp/ubc.diff</b>

       Edit the entire commit history of the “unified-buffer-cache” branch:

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>update</b> <b>-b</b> <b>unified-buffer-cache</b>
             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>update</b> <b>-c</b> <b>master</b>
             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>histedit</b>

       Before  working  against  existing  branches  in a repository cloned with <b>git</b> <b>clone</b> <b>--bare</b> instead of <b>got</b>
       <b>clone</b>, a Git “refspec” must be configured to map  all  references  in  the  remote  repository  into  the
       “refs/remotes”   namespace   of   the   local   repository.   This  can  be  achieved  by  setting  Git's
       <u>remote.origin.fetch</u> configuration variable to the value  “+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*”  with  the
       <b>git</b> <b>config</b> command:

             <b>$</b> <b>cd</b> <b>/var/git/repo</b>
             <b>$</b> <b>git</b> <b>config</b> <b>remote.origin.fetch</b> <b>'+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*'</b>

       Additionally, the “mirror” option must be disabled:

             <b>$</b> <b>cd</b> <b>/var/git/repo</b>
             <b>$</b> <b>git</b> <b>config</b> <b>remote.origin.mirror</b> <b>false</b>

       Alternatively,  the  following  <u><a href="../man1/git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch</a></u>(1)  configuration  item  can  be  added  manually  to  the  Git
       repository's <u>config</u> file:

             <b>[remote</b> <b>"origin"]</b>
             <b>url</b> <b>=</b> <b>...</b>
             <b>fetch</b> <b>=</b> <b>+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*</b>
             <b>mirror</b> <b>=</b> <b>false</b>

       This configuration leaves the local repository's “refs/heads” namespace free for use  by  local  branches
       checked   out   with   <b>got</b>   <b>checkout</b>  and,  if  needed,  created  with  <b>got</b>  <b>branch</b>.   Branches  in  the
       “refs/remotes/origin” namespace can now be updated with incoming changes from the remote repository  with
       <b>got</b>  <b>fetch</b>  or  <u><a href="../man1/git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch</a></u>(1) without extra command line arguments.  Newly fetched changes can be examined
       with <b>got</b> <b>log</b>.

       Display changes on the remote repository's version of the “master” branch, as of the last time <b>got</b>  <b>fetch</b>
       was run:

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>log</b> <b>-c</b> <b>origin/master</b> | <b>less</b>

       As  shown  here,  most  commands  accept  abbreviated  reference names such as “origin/master” instead of
       “refs/remotes/origin/master”.  The latter is only needed in case of ambiguity.

       <b>got</b> <b>rebase</b> can be used to merge changes which are visible on the “origin/master” branch into the “master”
       branch.  This will also merge local changes, if any, with the incoming changes:

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>update</b> <b>-b</b> <b>origin/master</b>
             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>rebase</b> <b>master</b>

       In order to make changes committed to the “unified-buffer-cache” visible  on  the  “master”  branch,  the
       “unified-buffer-cache” branch can be rebased onto the “master” branch:

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>update</b> <b>-b</b> <b>master</b>
             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>rebase</b> <b>unified-buffer-cache</b>

       Changes  on  the  “unified-buffer-cache”  branch  can now be made visible on the “master” branch with <b>got</b>
       <b>integrate</b>.  Because the rebase operation switched the work tree to the “unified-buffer-cache” branch, the
       work tree must be switched back to the “master” branch first:

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>update</b> <b>-b</b> <b>master</b>
             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>integrate</b> <b>unified-buffer-cache</b>

       On the “master” branch, log messages for local changes can now be amended with “OK” by  other  developers
       and any other important new information:

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>update</b> <b>-c</b> <b>origin/master</b>
             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>histedit</b> <b>-m</b>

       If  the  remote  repository  offers write access, local changes on the “master” branch can be sent to the
       remote repository with <b>got</b> <b>send</b>.  Usually, <b>got</b> <b>send</b> can be run without further arguments.  The  arguments
       shown here match defaults, provided the work tree's current branch is the “master” branch:

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>send</b> <b>-b</b> <b>master</b> <b>origin</b>

       If the remote repository requires the HTTPS protocol, the <u><a href="../man1/git-push.1.html">git-push</a></u>(1) command must be used instead:

             <b>$</b> <b>cd</b> <b>/var/git/src.git</b>
             <b>$</b> <b>git</b> <b>push</b> <b>origin</b> <b>master</b>

       When  making  contributions  to  projects  which use the “pull request” workflow, SSH protocol repository
       access needs to be set up first.  Once an account has been created on a Git hosting  site  it  should  be
       possible to upload a public SSH key for repository access authentication.

       The  “pull  request”  workflow  will  usually  involve two remote repositories.  In the real-life example
       below, the “origin” repository was forked from the “upstream” repository by using the Git hosting  site's
       web interface.  The <u><a href="../man5/got.conf.5.html">got.conf</a></u>(5) file in the local repository describes both remote repositories:

             # Jelmers's repository, which accepts pull requests
             remote "upstream" {
                     server <a href="mailto:git@github.com">git@github.com</a>
                     protocol ssh
                     repository "/jelmer/dulwich"
                     branch { "master" }
             }

             # Stefan's fork, used as the default remote repository
             remote "origin" {
                     server <a href="mailto:git@github.com">git@github.com</a>
                     protocol ssh
                     repository "/stspdotname/dulwich"
                     branch { "master" }
             }

       With  this  configuration, Stefan can create commits on “refs/heads/master” and send them to the “origin”
       repository by running:

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>send</b> <b>-b</b> <b>master</b> <b>origin</b>

       The changes can now be proposed to Jelmer by opening a pull  request  via  the  Git  hosting  site's  web
       interface.   If  Jelmer  requests  further  changes  to be made, additional commits can be created on the
       “master” branch and be added to the pull request by running <b>got</b> <b>send</b> again.

       If Jelmer prefers additional commits to be “squashed” then the following commands can be used to  achieve
       this:

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>update</b> <b>-b</b> <b>master</b>
             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>update</b> <b>-c</b> <b>origin/master</b>
             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>histedit</b> <b>-f</b>
             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>send</b> <b>-f</b> <b>-b</b> <b>master</b> <b>origin</b>

       In  addition to reviewing the pull request in the web user interface, Jelmer can fetch the pull request's
       branch into his local repository and create a local branch which contains the proposed changes:

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>fetch</b> <b>-R</b> <b>refs/pull/1046/head</b> <b>origin</b>
             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>branch</b> <b>-c</b> <b>refs/remotes/origin/pull/1046/head</b> <b>pr1046</b>

       Once Jelmer has accepted the pull request, Stefan can fetch the  merged  changes,  and  possibly  several
       other new changes, by running:

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>fetch</b> <b>upstream</b>

       The  merged  changes  will  now be visible under the reference “refs/remotes/upstream/master”.  The local
       “master” branch can now be rebased on top of the latest changes from upstream:

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>update</b> <b>-b</b> <b>upstream/master</b>
             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>rebase</b> <b>master</b>

       As an alternative to <b>got</b> <b>rebase</b>, branches can be merged with <b>got</b> <b>merge</b>:

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>update</b> <b>-b</b> <b>master</b>
             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>merge</b> <b>upstream/master</b>

       The question of whether to rebase or merge branches is  philosophical.   When  in  doubt,  refer  to  the
       software project's policies set by project maintainers.

       As  a  final  step, the forked repository's copy of the master branch needs to be kept in sync by sending
       the new changes there:

             <b>$</b> <b>got</b> <b>send</b> <b>-f</b> <b>-b</b> <b>master</b> <b>origin</b>

       If multiple pull requests need to be managed in parallel, a separate branch must be created for each pull
       request with <b>got</b> <b>branch</b>.  Each such branch can then be used as above, in  place  of  “refs/heads/master”.
       Changes for any accepted pull requests will still appear under “refs/remotes/upstream/master,” regardless
       of which branch was used in the forked repository to create a pull request.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>got</b> is a work-in-progress and some features remain to be implemented.

       At present, the user has to fall back on <u><a href="../man1/git.1.html">git</a></u>(1) to perform some tasks.  In particular:

       <b>•</b>   With  repositories  that use the sha256 object ID hashing algorithm, <u><a href="../man1/git.1.html">git</a></u>(1) is currently required for
           all network operations (clone, fetch, and push) because <b>got</b> does not yet support version 2 of the Git
           network protocol.

       <b>•</b>   Writing to remote repositories over HTTP or HTTPS protocols requires <u><a href="../man1/git-push.1.html">git-push</a></u>(1).

       <b>•</b>   The creation of merge commits with more than two parent commits requires <u><a href="../man1/git-merge.1.html">git-merge</a></u>(1).

       <b>•</b>   In situations where files or directories were moved around <b>got</b> will not automatically  merge  changes
           to new locations and <u><a href="../man1/git.1.html">git</a></u>(1) will usually produce better results.
