</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       disco - the DiscoDOS CLI

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>disco</b> [<b>--help</b>] [<b>--verbose</b>] [<b>--offline</b>] <u>{search,mix,suggest,import,setup}</u> <u>...</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       DiscoDOS helps a DJ remember and analyze what they played in their sets, or what they could possibly play
       in  the future. It's based on data pulled from a users Discogs record collection. Tracks can be organized
       into playlists and mix-transitions rated. Additionally the collection can be linked to the  online  music
       information  services MusicBrainz and AcousticBrainz, thus further information (like musical key and BPM)
       is made available to the user.

       DiscoDOS currently is available as a command line tool only, though prototypes of a mobile and a  desktop
       app  exist  already.  Despite  of  what  the  name implies, it's just the look that is reminiscent of the
       80s/90s operating system, its usability follows most standards of a typical shell utility you would  find
       on a UNIX-like operating system. It is aimed to support modern Linux, MacOS and Windows systems.

</pre><h4><b>SUBCOMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>search</b>  searches  for  releases  and tracks in the Discogs collection. Several actions can be executed on
               the found items, eg. adding to a mix, updating track info from  Discogs  or  fetching  additional
               information from MusicBrainz/AcousticBrainz. View this subcommand's help: "disco search <b>-h</b> ".

       <b>mix</b>     manages your mixes. View this subcommand's help: "disco mix <b>-h</b> "

       <b>suggest</b>
               suggests  tracks  based on what you've played before or views tracks based on BPM or musical key.
               View this subcommand's help: "disco suggest <b>-h</b> ".

       <b>import</b>  imports your whole Discogs collection or just  single  releases.  View  this  subcommand's  help:
               "disco import <b>-h</b> ".

       <b>setup</b>   sets  up  the DiscoBASE and handles database schema upgrades. View this subcommand's help: "disco
               setup <b>-h</b> ".

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
               show this help message and exit

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
               increases output verbosity / shows what DiscoDOS is doing under the hood ( <b>-v</b> is INFO level,  -vv
               is DEBUG level).

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--offline</b>
               DiscoDOS  checks  for  connectivity  to  online  services  (Discogs, MusicBrainz, AcousticBrainz)
               itself. This option forces offline mode. A lot of options work in  on-  and  offline  mode.  Some
               behave differently, depending on connection state.
