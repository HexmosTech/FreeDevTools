</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Xwayland - an X server for running X clients under Wayland.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Xwayland</b> [option ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Xwayland</u> is an X server and a Wayland client. It plays the role of a proxy between legacy X clients which
       do not support the Wayland protocols and the Wayland server.

       Usually,  <u>Xwayland</u>  is  spawned  automatically  by the Wayland server and runs rootless so that X clients
       integrate seamlessly with the rest of the Wayland desktop. It is however possible for a  user  to  launch
       Xwayland non-rootless, mainly for testing purposes.

       Like  all  of the X servers, <u>Xwayland</u> accepts the command line options described in the <u><a href="../man7/Xserver.7.html">Xserver</a></u>(7) manual
       page.  The following additional arguments are supported as well.

       <b>-decorate</b>
               Add decorations to the Xwayland root window when running rootful.

               This option has no effect when <u>Xwayland</u> is built without libdecor support (optional).

               This option is not compatible with rootless mode (<u>-rootless</u>).

       <b>-enable-ei-portal</b>
               Enable support for the XDG portal for input emulation.

               A Wayland compositor running nested should not use that command line option with Xwayland.

               This option has no effect if the compositor  doesn't  support  the  relevant  XDG  portal  or  if
               Xwayland was not compiled with EI and OEFFIS support.

       <b>-fullscreen</b>
               Set the Xwayland window fullscreen when running rootful.

               This option is not compatible with rootless mode (<u>-rootless</u>).

       <b>-geometry</b> <u>WxH</u>
               Sets the geometry of the <u>Xwayland</u> window to <u>WxH</u> when running rootful.

               This option is not compatible with rootless mode (<u>-rootless</u>).

       <b>-glamor</b>  <b>[</b><u>gl|es|off</u><b>]</b>
               Use given rendering API for Glamor acceleration. Possible options are <u>gl</u> and <u>es</u>.  If <u>Xwayland</u> was
               compiled  with  Glamor  support, this option will instruct <u>Xwayland</u> to use only requested API for
               Glamor. If this set to <u>off</u>, effect is equal to <u>-shm</u> option.  Without this option and without <u>-shm</u>
               option, <u>Xwayland</u> tries the OpenGL rendering API first, and fallback to GL ES  if  GL  version  is
               less than 2.1.

               This option is not compatible with <u>-shm</u> option.

       <b>-hidpi</b>  Adjust to the scale of the outputs when running rootful in windowing mode.

               This option is not compatible with rootless mode (<u>-rootless</u>).

       <b>-host-grab</b>
               Disable host keyboard shorcuts and confine the pointer when running rootful.

               This  feature  relies on the protocol for inhibiting the compositor keyboard shortcuts and on the
               protocol for pointer locking and confinement and may have no effect if the Wayland compositor  in
               use does not support these protocols.

               Use the keys [CTRL]+[SHIFT] simultaneously to release the keyboard and pointer devices.

               This option is not compatible with rootless mode (<u>-rootless</u>).

       <b>-initfd</b> <u>fd</u>
               Add  the  given  <u>fd</u> as a listen socket for initialization of X clients.  This options is aimed at
               <u>Wayland</u> servers which run <u>Xwayland</u> on-demand, to be able to spawn specific X clients  which  need
               to complete before other regular X clients can connect to <u>Xwayland</u>, like <u>xrdb</u>.

       <b>-listen</b> <u>fd</u>
               deprecated, use <u>-listenfd</u> instead.

       <b>-listenfd</b> <u>fd</u>
               Add  given  fd as a listen socket. This option is used by the <u>Wayland</u> server to pass <u>Xwayland</u> the
               socket where X clients connect.

       <b>-noTouchPointerEmulation</b>
               Disable touch pointer emulation. This allows the Wayland compositor to implement its own  pointer
               emulation mechanism for X11 clients that don't support touch input.

       <b>-force-xrandr-emulation</b>
               Force  additional  non-native modes to be exposed when viewporter is not supported by the Wayland
               compositor.

       <b>-nokeymap</b>
               Instructs <u>Xwayland</u> to ignore the keymap set by the Wayland compositor.

               By default, <u>Xwayland</u> (as any Wayland client) uses the keymap set by the Wayland compositor  using
               the standard Wayland protocol.

               This option is meant for some specific use cases where it may be desirable to let the X11 clients
               control  the  keymap  used  in Xwayland, ignoring the keymap specified by the Wayland compositor.
               <b>-output</b> <u>name</u> Specifies on which output <u>Xwayland</u> fullscreen rootful should be  placed.   The  name
               must match the name of an existing Wayland output (output names can be found using wayland-info).

               If  no  matching  output  can  be  found,  the Wayland compositor will decide on which output the
               fullscreen rootful <u>Xwayland</u> window will be placed.

               This option has no effect if <u>Xwayland</u> is not running fullscreen rootful.

       <b>-rootless</b>
               Run <u>Xwayland</u> rootless, so that X clients integrate seamlessly with Wayland clients in  a  Wayland
               desktop. That requires the Wayland server to be an X window manager as well.

       <b>-shm</b>    Force  the  shared  memory  backend  instead  of glamor (if available) for passing buffers to the
               Wayland server.

               This option is not compatible with <u>-glamor</u> option.

       <b>-verbose</b> [<u>n</u>]
               Sets the verbosity level for information printed on stderr.  If the <u>n</u> value isn't supplied,  each
               occurrence  of  this  option  increments  the verbosity level.  When the <u>n</u> value is supplied, the
               verbosity level is set to that value.  The default verbosity level is 0.

       <b>-version</b>
               Show the server version and exit.

       <b>-wm</b> <u>fd</u>  This option is used by the <u>Wayland</u> server to pass <u>Xwayland</u> the socket where the X window  manager
               client connects, when <u>Xwayland</u> is running with <u>-rootless</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>WAYLAND_DISPLAY</b>
               the name of the display of the Wayland server.

       <b>XWAYLAND_NO_GLAMOR</b>
               disable glamor and DRI3 support in <u>Xwayland</u>, for testing purposes.
