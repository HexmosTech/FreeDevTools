       nosetests - Nicer testing for Python

</pre><h4><b>NICER</b> <b>TESTING</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>PYTHON</b></h4><pre>
   <b>SYNOPSIS</b>
          nosetests [options] [names]

   <b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       nose collects tests automatically from python source files, directories and packages found in its working
       directory (which defaults to the current working directory). Any python source file, directory or package
       that  matches  the  testMatch regular expression (by default: <u>(?:^|[b_.-])[Tt]est)</u> will be collected as a
       test (or source for collection of tests). In addition, all other packages found in the working  directory
       will  be examined for python source files or directories that match testMatch. Package discovery descends
       all the way down the tree, so package.tests and package.sub.tests and package.sub.sub2.tests will all  be
       collected.

       Within  a  test directory or package, any python source file matching testMatch will be examined for test
       cases. Within a test module, functions and classes whose names match testMatch  and  TestCase  subclasses
       with  any  name  will  be  loaded  and  executed  as  tests.  Tests  may  use the assert keyword or raise
       AssertionErrors to indicate test failure. TestCase subclasses may do the same or use the various TestCase
       methods available.

       <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>default</b> <b>behavior</b> <b>of</b> <b>nose</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>tests</b> <b>from</b>  <b>files</b>  <b>which</b>  <b>are</b>
       <b>executable.</b>   To  include  tests  from such files, remove their executable bit or use the --exe flag (see
       'Options' section below).

   <b>Selecting</b> <b>Tests</b>
       To specify which tests to run, pass test names on the command line:

          nosetests only_test_this.py

       Test names specified may be file or module names, and may optionally indicate the test  case  to  run  by
       separating  the  module  or  file name from the test case name with a colon. Filenames may be relative or
       absolute. Examples:

          nosetests test.module
          nosetests another.test:TestCase.test_method
          nosetests a.test:TestCase
          nosetests /path/to/test/file.py:test_function

       You may also change the working directory where nose looks for tests by using the -w switch:

          nosetests -w /path/to/tests

       Note, however, that support for multiple -w arguments is now deprecated and will be removed in  a  future
       release.  As of nose 0.10, you can get the same behavior by specifying the target directories <u>without</u> the
       -w switch:

          nosetests /path/to/tests /another/path/to/tests

       Further customization of test selection and loading is possible through the use of plugins.

       Test result output is identical to that of unittest, except for the additional features  (error  classes,
       and  plugin-supplied  features  such  as output capture and assert introspection) detailed in the options
       below.

   <b>Configuration</b>
       In addition to passing command-line options, you may also put configuration  options  in  your  project's
       <u>setup.cfg</u>  file, or a .noserc or nose.cfg file in your home directory. In any of these standard ini-style
       config files, you put your nosetests configuration in a <b>[nosetests]</b> section. Options are the same  as  on
       the  command  line,  with  the -- prefix removed. For options that are simple switches, you must supply a
       value:

          [nosetests]
          verbosity=3
          with-doctest=1

       All configuration files that are found will be loaded and their options combined. You  can  override  the
       standard config file loading with the <b>-c</b> option.

   <b>Using</b> <b>Plugins</b>
       There  are  numerous nose plugins available via easy_install and elsewhere. To use a plugin, just install
       it. The plugin will add command line options to nosetests. To verify that the plugin is installed, run:

          nosetests --plugins

       You can add -v or -vv to that command to show more information about each plugin.

       If you are running nose.main() or nose.run() from a script, you can specify a list of plugins to  use  by
       passing a list of plugins with the plugins keyword argument.

   <b>0.9</b> <b>plugins</b>
       nose  1.0  can  use  SOME  plugins  that  were written for nose 0.9. The default plugin manager inserts a
       compatibility wrapper around 0.9 plugins that adapts the changed plugin api calls. However, plugins  that
       access  nose  internals  are likely to fail, especially if they attempt to access test case or test suite
       classes. For example, plugins that try to determine if a test passed to startTest is an  individual  test
       or  a  suite  will  fail, partly because suites are no longer passed to startTest and partly because it's
       likely that the plugin is trying to find out if the test is an instance of a class that no longer exists.

   <b>0.10</b> <b>and</b> <b>0.11</b> <b>plugins</b>
       All plugins written for nose 0.10 and 0.11 should work with nose 1.0.

   <b>Options</b>
       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Output nose version and exit

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--plugins</b>
              Output list of available plugins and exit. Combine with higher verbosity for greater detail

       <b>-v=DEFAULT,</b> <b>--verbose=DEFAULT</b>
              Be more verbose. [NOSE_VERBOSE]

       <b>--verbosity=VERBOSITY</b>
              Set verbosity; --verbosity=2 is the same as -v

       <b>-q=DEFAULT,</b> <b>--quiet=DEFAULT</b>
              Be less verbose

       <b>-c=FILES,</b> <b>--config=FILES</b>
              Load configuration from config file(s). May be specified multiple times; in that case, all  config
              files will be loaded and combined

       <b>-w=WHERE,</b> <b>--where=WHERE</b>
              Look for tests in this directory. May be specified multiple times. The first directory passed will
              be used as the working directory, in place of the current working directory, which is the default.
              Others will be added to the list of tests to execute. [NOSE_WHERE]

       <b>--py3where=PY3WHERE</b>
              Look for tests in this directory under Python 3.x. Functions the same as 'where', but only applies
              if  running  under  Python  3.x or above.  Note that, if present under 3.x, this option completely
              replaces any directories specified with  'where',  so  the  'where'  option  becomes  ineffective.
              [NOSE_PY3WHERE]

       <b>-m=REGEX,</b> <b>--match=REGEX,</b> <b>--testmatch=REGEX</b>
              Files,  directories,  function  names,  and  class  names  that  match this regular expression are
              considered tests.  Default: (?:^|[b_./-])[Tt]est [NOSE_TESTMATCH]

       <b>--tests=NAMES</b>
              Run these tests (comma-separated list). This argument is useful mainly from  configuration  files;
              on the command line, just pass the tests to run as additional arguments with no switch.

       <b>-l=DEFAULT,</b> <b>--debug=DEFAULT</b>
              Activate  debug  logging  for  one  or more systems. Available debug loggers: nose, nose.importer,
              nose.inspector, nose.plugins, nose.result and nose.selector. Separate multiple names with a comma.

       <b>--debug-log=FILE</b>
              Log debug messages to this file (default: sys.stderr)

       <b>--logging-config=FILE,</b> <b>--log-config=FILE</b>
              Load logging config from this file -- bypasses all other logging config settings.

       <b>-I=REGEX,</b> <b>--ignore-files=REGEX</b>
              Completely ignore any file that matches this regular expression. Takes precedence over  any  other
              settings  or plugins. Specifying this option will replace the default setting. Specify this option
              multiple times to add more regular expressions [NOSE_IGNORE_FILES]

       <b>-e=REGEX,</b> <b>--exclude=REGEX</b>
              Don't run tests that match regular expression [NOSE_EXCLUDE]

       <b>-i=REGEX,</b> <b>--include=REGEX</b>
              This regular expression will be applied to files, directories, function names, and class names for
              a chance to include additional tests that do not match TESTMATCH.  Specify  this  option  multiple
              times to add more regular expressions [NOSE_INCLUDE]

       <b>-x,</b> <b>--stop</b>
              Stop running tests after the first error or failure

       <b>-P,</b> <b>--no-path-adjustment</b>
              Don't make any changes to sys.path when loading tests [NOSE_NOPATH]

       <b>--exe</b>  Look  for  tests  in  python modules that are executable. Normal behavior is to exclude executable
              modules, since they may not be import-safe [NOSE_INCLUDE_EXE]

       <b>--noexe</b>
              DO NOT look for tests in python modules that are executable. (The default on the windows  platform
              is to do so.)

       <b>--traverse-namespace</b>
              Traverse through all path entries of a namespace package

       <b>--first-package-wins,</b> <b>--first-pkg-wins,</b> <b>--1st-pkg-wins</b>
              nose's  importer will normally evict a package from sys.modules if it sees a package with the same
              name in a different location. Set this option to disable that behavior.

       <b>--no-byte-compile</b>
              Prevent nose from byte-compiling the source into .pyc files while nose is scanning for and running
              tests.

       <b>-a=ATTR,</b> <b>--attr=ATTR</b>
              Run only tests that have attributes specified by ATTR [NOSE_ATTR]

       <b>-A=EXPR,</b> <b>--eval-attr=EXPR</b>
              Run only tests for whose attributes the Python expression EXPR evaluates to True [NOSE_EVAL_ATTR]

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--nocapture</b>
              Don't capture stdout (any stdout output will be printed immediately) [NOSE_NOCAPTURE]

       <b>--nologcapture</b>
              Disable logging capture plugin. Logging configuration will be left intact. [NOSE_NOLOGCAPTURE]

       <b>--logging-format=FORMAT</b>
              Specify custom format to print statements. Uses the  same  format  as  used  by  standard  logging
              handlers. [NOSE_LOGFORMAT]

       <b>--logging-datefmt=FORMAT</b>
              Specify  custom  date/time  format  to  print statements. Uses the same format as used by standard
              logging handlers. [NOSE_LOGDATEFMT]

       <b>--logging-filter=FILTER</b>
              Specify which statements to filter in/out. By default, everything is captured. If  the  output  is
              too  verbose,  use  this  option  to filter out needless output.  Example: filter=foo will capture
              statements issued ONLY to
               foo or foo.what.ever.sub but not foobar or other logger.  Specify multiple  loggers  with  comma:
              filter=foo,bar,baz.   If  any  logger  name  is  prefixed with a minus, eg filter=-foo, it will be
              excluded rather than included.  Default:  exclude  logging  messages  from  nose  itself  (-nose).
              [NOSE_LOGFILTER]

       <b>--logging-clear-handlers</b>
              Clear all other logging handlers

       <b>--logging-level=DEFAULT</b>
              Set the log level to capture

       <b>--with-coverage</b>
              Enable plugin Coverage: Activate a coverage report using Ned Batchelder's coverage module.
               [NOSE_WITH_COVERAGE]

              Minimum percentage of coverage for tests to pass [NOSE_COVER_MIN_PERCENTAGE]

       <b>--cover-inclusive</b>
              Include all python files under working directory in coverage report.  Useful for discovering holes
              in test coverage if not all files are imported by the test suite. [NOSE_COVER_INCLUSIVE]

       <b>--cover-html</b>
              Produce HTML coverage information

       <b>--cover-html-dir=DIR</b>
              Produce HTML coverage information in dir

       <b>--cover-branches</b>
              Include branch coverage in coverage report [NOSE_COVER_BRANCHES]

       <b>--cover-xml</b>
              Produce XML coverage information

       <b>--cover-xml-file=FILE</b>

               [NOSE_WITH_DOCTEST]

       <b>--doctest-tests</b>
              Also  look  for  doctests  in  test  modules. Note that classes, methods and functions should have
              either doctests or non-doctest tests, not both. [NOSE_DOCTEST_TESTS]

       <b>--doctest-extension=EXT</b>
              Also look for doctests in files with this extension [NOSE_DOCTEST_EXTENSION]

       <b>--doctest-result-variable=VAR</b>
              Change the variable name set to the result of the last interpreter command from the  default  '_'.
              Can   be   used   to   avoid   conflicts   with  the  _()  function  used  for  text  translation.
              [NOSE_DOCTEST_RESULT_VAR]

       <b>--doctest-fixtures=SUFFIX</b>
              Find fixtures for a doctest file in module with this name appended to the base name of the doctest
              file

       <b>--with-isolation</b>
              Enable plugin IsolationPlugin: Activate the  isolation  plugin  to  isolate  changes  to  external
              modules  to  a  single  test  module  or  package.  The  isolation  plugin  resets the contents of
              sys.modules after each test module or package runs to its state before the test. PLEASE NOTE  that
              this  plugin  should  not  be  used  with  the  coverage plugin, or in any other case where module
              reloading may produce undesirable side-effects.
               [NOSE_WITH_ISOLATION]

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--detailed-errors,</b> <b>--failure-detail</b>
              Add detail to error output by attempting to evaluate failed asserts [NOSE_DETAILED_ERRORS]

       <b>--with-profile</b>

               [NOSE_WITH_PROFILE]

       <b>--profile-sort=SORT</b>
              Set sort order for profiler output

       <b>--profile-stats-file=FILE</b>
              Profiler stats file; default is a new temp file on each run

       <b>--profile-restrict=RESTRICT</b>
              Restrict profiler output. See help for pstats.Stats for details

       <b>--no-skip</b>
              Disable special handling of SkipTest exceptions.

       <b>--with-id</b>
              Enable plugin TestId: Activate to add a test id (like #1) to each test name output. Activate  with
              --failed to rerun failing tests only.
               [NOSE_WITH_ID]

       <b>--id-file=FILE</b>
              Store  test  ids  found  in  test  runs  in this file. Default is the file .noseids in the working
              directory.

       <b>--failed</b>
              Run the tests that failed in the last test run.

       <b>--processes=NUM</b>
              Spread test run among this many processes. Set a number equal to the number of processors or cores
              in your machine for best results.  Pass  a  negative  number  to  have  the  number  of  processes
              automatically  set to the number of cores. Passing 0 means to disable parallel testing. Default is
              0 unless NOSE_PROCESSES is set. [NOSE_PROCESSES]

       <b>--process-timeout=SECONDS</b>
              Set  timeout  for  return  of  results  from  each   test   runner   process.   Default   is   10.
              [NOSE_PROCESS_TIMEOUT]

       <b>--process-restartworker</b>
              If  set,  will  restart  each  worker process once their tests are done, this helps control memory
              leaks from killing the system. [NOSE_PROCESS_RESTARTWORKER]

       <b>--with-xunit</b>
              Enable plugin Xunit: This  plugin  provides  test  results  in  the  standard  XUnit  XML  format.
              [NOSE_WITH_XUNIT]

       <b>--xunit-file=FILE</b>
              Path  to  xml file to store the xunit report in. Default is nosetests.xml in the working directory
              [NOSE_XUNIT_FILE]

       <b>--xunit-testsuite-name=PACKAGE</b>
              Name of the testsuite in the xunit xml, generated by plugin. Default test suite name is nosetests.

       <b>--all-modules</b>
              Enable plugin AllModules: Collect tests from all python modules.
               [NOSE_ALL_MODULES]

       <b>--collect-only</b>
              Enable collect-only: Collect and output test names only, don't run any tests.
