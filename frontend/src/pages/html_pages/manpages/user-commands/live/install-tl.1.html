</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       install-tl - TeX Live cross-platform installer

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       install-tl [<u>option</u>]...

       install-tl-windows.bat [<u>option</u>]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This installer creates a runnable TeX Live installation from various media, including over the network,
       from local hard disk, a DVD, etc. The installer works on all platforms supported by TeX Live. For
       information on initially downloading TeX Live, see &lt;https://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html&gt;.

       The basic idea of TeX Live installation is for you to choose one of the top-level <u>schemes</u>, each of which
       is defined as a different set of <u>collections</u> and <u>packages</u>, where a collection is a set of packages, and a
       package is what contains actual files. Each package is in exactly one collection, while schemes can
       contain any combination of packages and collections.

       Within the installer, you can choose a scheme, and further customize the set of collections to install,
       but not the set of the packages.  To work at the package level, use "tlmgr" (reference just below) after
       the initial installation is complete.

       The default is "scheme-full", which installs everything, and this is highly recommended.

</pre><h4><b>REFERENCES</b></h4><pre>
       Post-installation configuration, package updates, and more, are handled through <b><a href="../man1/tlmgr.1.html">tlmgr</a></b>(1), the TeX Live
       Manager (&lt;https://tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html&gt;).

       The most up-to-date version of this installer documentation is on the Internet at
       &lt;https://tug.org/texlive/doc/install-tl.html&gt;.

       For step-by-step instructions, see &lt;https://tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html&gt;.

       For the full documentation of TeX Live, see &lt;https://tug.org/texlive/doc&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       With no options, "install-tl" drops you into an interactive menu where essentially all default settings
       can be changed. With options, you can initialize the settings in various ways, or perform the
       installation without interaction. Some examples:

       "install-tl --paper=letter"
           Initialize paper size setting. The only values allowed are "letter" and (the default) "a4".

       "install-tl --scheme" <u>scheme</u>
           Initialize  the  installation  scheme;  the  default  is  "full".   For  a  list  of schemes, see the
           interactive "S" menu.

       "install-tl --no-interaction"
           Perform the installation immediately after parsing options, without entering the interactive menu.

       "install-tl --profile" <u>texlive.profile</u>
           Install, without interaction, according to the given  TL  profile  file;  see  "PROFILES"  below.  To
           initialize from the profile and then enter the interactive menu, add "--init-from-profile".

       Full documentation follows.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       As  usual, all options can be specified in any order, and with either a leading "-" or "--".  An argument
       value can be separated from its option by either a space or "=".

       The options relating to customization of the  installation  can  also  be  selected  in  the  interactive
       installation menus (GUI or text).

       <b>-gui</b> [[=]<u>module</u>]
       <b>-no-gui</b>
           If no <u>module</u> is given, starts the Tcl/Tk (see below) GUI installer.

           If <u>module</u> is given loads the given installer module. Currently the following modules are supported:

           "text"
               The  text  mode  user interface (default on Unix systems, including Macs).  Same as the "-no-gui"
               option.

           "tcl" (or "perltk" or "wizard" or "expert" or nothing)
               The Tcl/Tk user interface (default on Windows).  It starts with a small number  of  configuration
               options,  roughly  equivalent  to  what  the former wizard option offers, but a button "Advanced"
               takes you to a screen with roughly the same options as the former "perltk" interface.

           The default GUI requires Tcl/Tk. This was standard on Macs, but has been removed in the latest  macOS
           releases.  It's  often  already  installed  on GNU/Linux, or can be easily installed through a distro
           package manager.  For Windows, TeX Live provides a Tcl/Tk runtime.

       <b>-lang</b> <u>llcode</u>
           By default, the Tcl GUI uses the language detection built into Tcl/Tk. If that fails you can select a
           different language by giving this option with a  language  code  (based  on  ISO  639-1).   Currently
           supported  (but not necessarily completely translated) are: English (en, default), Czech (cs), German
           (de), French (fr), Italian (it),  Japanese  (ja),  Dutch  (nl),  Polish  (pl),  Brazilian  Portuguese
           (pt_BR),  Russian  (ru),  Slovak (sk), Slovenian (sl), Serbian (sr), Ukrainian (uk), Vietnamese (vi),
           simplified Chinese (zh_CN), and traditional Chinese (zh_TW).

       <b>-repository</b> <u>url|path</u>
           Specify the package repository to be used as the source of the installation. In short, this can be  a
           directory  name  or  a  url using http(s), ftp, or scp. The documentation for "tlmgr" has the details
           (&lt;https://tug.org/texlive/doc/tlmgr.html#OPTIONS&gt;).

           For    installation,    the    default    is    to    pick    a    mirror    automatically,     using
           &lt;https://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet&gt;;  the  chosen  mirror  is  then  used  for the entire
           download.  You  can  use  the  special  argument  "ctan"  as   an   abbreviation   for   this.   (See
           &lt;https://ctan.org&gt; for more about CTAN and its mirrors.)

           After  installation  is  complete,  you  can  use  that  installation  as  the repository for another
           installation.  If you chose to install less than the full scheme containing all packages, the list of
           available schemes will be adjusted accordingly.

       <b>-select-repository</b>
           This option allows you to choose a particular mirror from the current list of  active  CTAN  mirrors.
           This option is supported in the "text" and "gui" installer modes, and will also offer to install from
           local  media  if  available, or from a repository specified on the command line. It's useful when the
           (default) automatic redirection does not choose a good host for you.

       <b>-all-options</b>
           Normally options not relevant to the current platform are not shown  (e.g.,  when  running  on  Unix,
           Windows-specific  options  are  omitted).   Giving  this  command line option allows configuring such
           "foreign" settings.

       <b>-custom-bin</b> <u>path</u>
           If you have built your own set of TeX Live binaries (e.g.,  because  precompiled  binaries  were  not
           provided  by  TL  for your platform), this option allows you to specify the <u>path</u> to a directory where
           the binaries for the current system are present. The installation will continue as usual, but at  the
           end  all  files from <u>path</u> are copied over to "bin/custom/" under your installation directory and this
           "bin/custom/" directory is what will be added to the path for the post-install  actions.  To  install
           multiple custom binary sets, manually rename "custom" before doing each.

           For  more information on custom binaries, see &lt;https://tug.org/texlive/custom-bin.html&gt;.  For general
           information on building TeX Live, see &lt;https://tug.org/texlive/build.html&gt;.

       <b>-debug-fakenet</b>
           Pretend we're doing a network install. This is for the sole purpose of testing  the  code  to  handle
           broken downloads, via moving package files aside in a tlnet mirror hierarchy.

       <b>-debug-setup-vars</b>
           Print  final values of directory variables; for more debugging information on how they were set, also
           specify "-v".

       <b>-debug-translation</b>
           In the former Perl/Tk GUI modes, this option reported  any  missing,  or  more  likely  untranslated,
           messages to standard error. Not yet implemented for the Tcl interface. Helpful for translators to see
           what remains to be done.

       <b>-force-platform</b> <u>platform</u>
           Instead  of  auto-detecting  the  current platform, use <u>platform</u>.  Binaries for this platform must be
           present in "bin/"<u>platform</u>"/" and they must be runnable, or installation will fail. "-force-arch" is a
           synonym.

       <b>-help</b>, <b>--help</b>, <b>-?</b>
           Display    this    help    and    exit.    (This    help    is     also     on     the     web     at
           &lt;https://tug.org/texlive/doc/install-tl.html&gt;).  Sometimes  the  "perldoc" and/or "PAGER" programs on
           the system have problems, possibly resulting in control characters being literally output. This can't
           always be detected, but you can set the "NOPERLDOC" environment variable and "perldoc"  will  not  be
           used.

       <b>-in-place</b>
           This  is  a  quick-and-dirty installation option in case you already have an rsync or svn checkout of
           TeX Live.  It will use the checkout as-is and will just do the  necessary  post-install.   Be  warned
           that  the file "tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb" may be rewritten, that removal has to be done manually, and that
           the only realistic way to maintain this installation is to redo it from time to time.  This option is
           not available via the installer interfaces.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

       <b>-init-from-profile</b> <u>profile_file</u>
           Similar to <b>-profile</b> (see "PROFILES" below), but only initializes the installation configuration  from
           <u>profile_file</u> and then starts a normal interactive session. Environment variables are not ignored.

       <b>-logfile</b> <u>file</u>
           Write  both all messages (informational, debugging, warnings) to <u>file</u>, in addition to standard output
           or standard error.

           If this option is not given, the installer will create a  log  file  in  the  root  of  the  writable
           installation tree, for example, "/usr/local/texlive/YYYY/install-tl.log" for the <u>YYYY</u> release.

       <b>-no-cls</b>
           For the text mode installer only: do not clear the screen when entering a new menu. For debugging.

       <b>-no-continue</b>
           Quit early on installation failure of a non-core package.

           By  default,  a few core packages are installed first; then, a failed installation of any other (non-
           core) package is noted, but does not stop the installation. Any such  failed  packages  are  retried,
           once.

           If  the  retry also fails, by default the installer proceeds to completion anyway, with the idea that
           it was a transient network  problem  and  reinstallation  will  succeed  later.  If  this  option  is
           specified, and the retry fails, the installer aborts.

       <b>-no-doc-install</b>
       <b>-no-src-install</b>
           Do  not install the documentation resp. source package files, both for the immediate installation and
           for future updates. After installation, inclusion of the doc/src files can be re-enabled via "tlmgr":

             tlmgr option docfiles 1
             tlmgr option srcfiles 1

           If you later find that you want the doc/src files for a package that has been installed without them,
           you can get them like this (using the "fontspec" package as the example):

             tlmgr install --reinstall --with-doc --with-src fontspec

           The source files mentioned here are those relating to TeX packages, such as ".dtx" files. The sources
           that are compiled to make the binaries are available separately: see &lt;https://tug.org/texlive/svn/&gt;.

       <b>-no-installation</b>
           Do not perform any installation. This is for debugging the initialization and setup routines  without
           touching the disk.

       <b>-no-interaction</b>
           Do  not  enter  the  interactive  menu; immediately perform the installation after initialization and
           option parsing. Also omit the check for a previous installation and asking about  importing  previous
           settings.

       <b>-no-persistent-downloads</b>
       <b>-persistent-downloads</b>
           For  network  installs,  activating  this  option  makes  the  installer  try  to set up a persistent
           connection using the "LWP" Perl module.  This opens only one connection between your computer and the
           server per session and reuses it, instead of initiating  a  new  download  for  each  package,  which
           typically yields a significant speed-up.

           This  option  is turned on by default, and the installation program will fall back to using "wget" if
           this  is   not   possible.    To   disable   usage   of   LWP   and   persistent   connections,   use
           "-no-persistent-downloads".

       <b>-no-verify-downloads</b>
           By  default, if a GnuPG "gpg" binary is found in PATH, downloads are verified against a cryptographic
           signature. This option disables such verification.  The  full  description  is  in  the  Crytographic
           Verification         section         of         the        "tlmgr"        documentation,        e.g.,
           &lt;https://tug.org/texlive/doc/tlmgr.html#CRYPTOGRAPHIC-VERIFICATION&gt;

       <b>-non-admin</b>
           For Windows only: configure for the current user, not for all users.

       <b>-paper</b> "a4"<b>|</b>"letter"
           Set the default paper size for all TeX Live programs, as specified.  The default is "a4".  The  paper
           size can be set after installation with the "tlmgr paper" command.

       <b>-portable</b>
           Install  for  portable  use,  e.g., on a USB stick.  See the "instopt_portable" description below for
           details.

       <b>-print-platform</b>
           Print the TeX Live identifier for the detected platform (hardware/operating  system)  combination  to
           standard output, and exit.  "-print-arch" is a synonym.

       <b>-profile</b> <u>profile_file</u>
           Load  <u>profile_file</u>  and  do  the installation with no user interaction, that is, a batch (unattended)
           install.  Environment variables are ignored. See "PROFILES" below.

       <b>-q</b>  Omit normal informational messages.

       <b>-scheme</b> <u>scheme</u>
           Schemes are the highest level of package grouping in TeX Live; the  default  is  to  use  the  "full"
           scheme,  which includes everything. This option overrides that default. The <u>scheme</u> argument value may
           optionally have a prefix "scheme-". The list of supported scheme names depends on what  your  package
           repository provides; see the interactive menu list.

       <b>-texdir</b> <u>dir</u>
           Specify the system installation directory; the default is "/usr/local/texlive/YYYY" for release YYYY.
           Specifying  this option also causes the "TEXMFLOCAL", "TEXMFSYSCONFIG", and "TEXMFSYSVAR" directories
           to be set as subdirectories of <u>dir</u>, so they don't have to be set individually.

           There is a brief summary of these directories trees at "DIRECTORY TREES" below; for  details  on  the
           trees  set  up  by  default,  and  their  intended  usage,  see  the  main  TeX Live documentation at
           &lt;https://tug.org/texlive/doc&gt;.

       <b>-texuserdir</b> <u>dir</u>
           Specify the user installation directory; the default is "<a href="file:~/.texliveYYYY">~/.texliveYYYY</a>" (except on Macs, where there
           is no leading dot).  Specifying this also  causes  the  "TEXMFHOME",  "TEXMFCONFIG",  and  "TEXMFVAR"
           directories to be set as subdirectories of <u>dir</u>.

       <b>-texmflocal</b> <u>dir</u>
           Specify  the  "TEXMFLOCAL"  directory;  the default is "/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local", that is, one
           level up from the main installation. This is so locally-installed packages can be easily used  across
           releases,  which  is  usually  desirable.  Specifying  the  "-texdir"  option  changes  this, putting
           "TEXMFLOCAL" under the main tree. The "-texmflocal"  option  can  be  used  to  specify  an  explicit
           directory.

           Anything    installed    here    must    follow    the   TeX   directory   structure   (TDS),   e.g.,
           "TEXMFHOME/tex/latex/mypkg/mypkg.sty". TDS reference: &lt;https://tug.org/tds&gt;.

       <b>-texmfhome</b> <u>dir</u>
           Specify  the  "TEXMFHOME"  directory;  the  default  is  "<a href="file:~/texmf">~/texmf</a>",  except  on  Macs,  where  it  is
           "<a href="file:~/Library/texmf">~/Library/texmf</a>". Analogously to "TEXMFLOCAL", the "-texuserdir" option changes this default.

           Also as with "TEXMFLOCAL", anything installed here must follow the TDS.

       <b>-texmfsysconfig</b> <u>dir</u>
       <b>-texmfsysvar</b> <u>dir</u>
           Specify the "TEXMFSYSCONFIG" and "TEXMFSYSVAR" system directories.

       <b>-texmfconfig</b> <u>dir</u>
       <b>-texmfvar</b> <u>dir</u>
           Specify    the    "TEXMFCONFIG"    and    "TEXMFVAR"    user    directories.     The   defaults   are
           "<a href="file:~/.texliveYYYY/texmf-">~/.texliveYYYY/texmf-</a>{config,var}",  except  on   Macs,   where   the   leading   dot   is   omitted
           ("<a href="file:~/texliveYYYY/...">~/texliveYYYY/...</a>").

       <b>-v</b>  Include  verbose  debugging  messages;  repeat  for maximum debugging: "-v -v".  (Further repeats are
           accepted but ignored.)

       <b>-version</b>, <b>--version</b>
           Output version information and exit.  If "-v" is also given, the versions of  the  TeX  Live  modules
           used are also reported.

</pre><h4><b>PROFILES</b></h4><pre>
       A  <u>profile</u>  file  normally  contains  all  the  values  needed to perform an installation. After a normal
       installation  has  finished,  a  profile  for  that  exact  installation   is   written   to   the   file
       "tlpkg/texlive.profile".  In addition, from the text menu one can select "P" to save the current setup as
       a  profile  at  any time. These are small text files; feel free to peruse and edit them according to your
       needs.

       Such a profile file can be given as the argument to "-profile",  for  example  to  redo  the  exact  same
       installation  on a different system.  Alternatively, you can use a custom profile, most easily created by
       starting from a generated one and changing values. An empty profile file will cause the installer to  use
       the defaults.

       As  mentioned  above,  the  installer  only  supports selection by scheme and collections, not individual
       packages, so packages cannot be specified in profile files either. Use "tlmgr" to  work  at  the  package
       level.

       Within a profile file, each line consists of

       <u>variable</u> [<u>value</u>]

       except  for comment lines starting with "#".  The possible variable names are listed below.  Values, when
       present, are either 0 or 1  for  booleans,  or  strings  (which  must  be  specified  without  any  quote
       characters).  Leading whitespace is ignored.

       If  the  variable  "selected_scheme"  is defined and <u>no</u> collection variables at all are defined, then the
       collections required by the specified scheme (which  might  change  over  time)  are  installed,  without
       explicitly  listing  them. This eases maintenance of profile files. If any collections are specified in a
       profile, though, then the scheme is ignored and all desired collections must be given explicitly.

       For example, a line

         selected_scheme scheme-small

       along with definitions for the installation directories (given below under "path  options")  suffices  to
       install  the  "small"  scheme with all default options.  The schemes are described in the "S" menu in the
       text installer, or equivalent.

       In addition to "selected_scheme", here are the other variable names supported in a profile:

       <b>collection</b> <b>options</b> (prefix "collection-")

       Collections are specified with a variable name with the prefix "collection-"  followed  by  a  collection
       name;  there  is  no  value.  For instance, "collection-basic".  The collections are described in the "C"
       menu.

       Schemes and collections (and packages) are ultimately defined by the files in the "tlpkg/tlpsrc/"  source
       directory.

       <b>path</b> <b>options</b>

       It  is  best  to  define all of these, even though they may not be used in a given installation, so as to
       avoid unintentionally getting a default value that could cause problems later.

         TEXDIR
         TEXMFLOCAL
         TEXMFSYSCONFIG
         TEXMFSYSVAR
         TEXMFCONFIG
         TEXMFVAR
         TEXMFHOME

       <b>installer</b> <b>options</b> (prefix "instopt_")

       "instopt_adjustpath" (default 0 on Unix, 1 on Windows)
           Adjust "PATH" environment variable.

       "instopt_adjustrepo" (default 1)
           Set remote repository to a multiplexed CTAN mirror after installation; see "-repository" above.

       "instopt_letter" (default 0)
           Set letter size paper as the default, instead of a4.

       "instopt_portable" (default 0)
           Install for portable use, e.g., on a USB stick, without touching the host system. Specifically,  this
           forces  the  user  directories  "TEXMFHOME",  "TEXMFCONFIG", "TEXMFVAR" to be identical to the system
           directories "TEXMFLOCAL", "TEXMFSYSCONFIG", "TEXMFSYSVAR", respectively (regardless of other  options
           and environment variable.)

           In  addition, on Windows, it disables the desktop integration, path adjustment, and file associations
           actions usually performed.

       "instopt_write18_restricted" (default 1)
           Enable "\write18" for a restricted set of programs.

       <b>tlpdb</b> <b>options</b> (prefix "tlpdbopt_")

       The    definitive    list    is     given     in     "tlpkg/TeXLive/TLConfig.pm",     in     the     hash
       %TeXLive::TLConfig::TLPDBOptions,   together  with  explanations.   All  items  given  there  <u>except</u>  for
       "tlpdbopt_location" can be specified.  Here is the current list:

         tlpdbopt_autobackup
         tlpdbopt_backupdir
         tlpdbopt_create_formats
         tlpdbopt_desktop_integration
         tlpdbopt_file_assocs
         tlpdbopt_generate_updmap
         tlpdbopt_install_docfiles
         tlpdbopt_install_srcfiles
         tlpdbopt_post_code
         tlpdbopt_sys_bin
         tlpdbopt_sys_info
         tlpdbopt_sys_man
         tlpdbopt_w32_multi_user

       <b>platform</b> <b>options</b> (prefix "binary_")

       For each supported platform in TeX Live (directories under "bin/"), the variable "binary_"<u>PLATFORM</u> can be
       set with value 1.  For example:

         binary_x86_64-linux 1

       If no "binary_" settings are made, the default is whatever the current machine is running.

       In releases before 2017, many profile variables  had  different  names  (not  documented  here;  see  the
       "install-tl"  source).   They  are  accepted and transformed to the names given above.  When a profile is
       written, the names above are always used.

       For more details on all of the above options, consult the  TeX  Live  installation  manual,  linked  from
       &lt;https://tug.org/texlive/doc&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       For ease in scripting and debugging, "install-tl" looks for the following environment variables. They are
       not of interest for normal user installations.

       "NOPERLDOC"
           Don't try to run the "--help" message through "perldoc".

       "TEXLIVE_DOWNLOADER"
       "TL_DOWNLOAD_PROGRAM"
       "TL_DOWNLOAD_ARGS"
       "TEXLIVE_PREFER_OWN"
           These  override  the  normal  choice  of  the  download  and  other utility programs; see the "tlmgr"
           documentation, e.g., &lt;https://tug.org/texlive/doc/tlmgr.html#ENVIRONMENT-VARIABLES&gt;.

       "TEXLIVE_INSTALL_ENV_NOCHECK"
           Omit the check for environment variables containing the string "tex".  People developing  TeX-related
           software are likely to have many such variables.

       "TEXLIVE_INSTALL_NO_CONTEXT_CACHE"
           Omit creating the ConTeXt cache.  This is useful for redistributors.

       "TEXLIVE_INSTALL_NO_DISKCHECK"
           If  set  to  1, omit free disk space check. By default, if a POSIX-compliant "df" program (supporting
           "-Pk") is available, the installer checks for available  disk  space  in  the  selected  installation
           location, and will abort installation if there is insufficient disk space, plus a margin of 100MB. An
           equivalent check is made on Windows (not involving "df").

       "TEXLIVE_INSTALL_NO_RESUME"
           Omit  check for installing on top of a previous installation and then asking about importing previous
           settings.

       "TEXLIVE_INSTALL_NO_WELCOME"
           Omit printing the welcome message after successful installation, e.g., when testing.

       "TEXLIVE_INSTALL_PAPER"
           Set the default paper size for all relevant programs; must be either "letter" or "a4". The default is
           "a4".

       "TEXLIVE_INSTALL_PREFIX"
       "TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFCONFIG"
       "TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFVAR"
       "TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFHOME"
       "TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFLOCAL"
       "TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFSYSCONFIG"
       "TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFSYSVAR"
           Specify the respective directories. "TEXLIVE_INSTALL_PREFIX" defaults  to  "/usr/local/texlive".  All
           the defaults can be seen by running the installer interactively and then typing "D" for the directory
           menu.

           The  various  command  line  options for specifying directories override these environment variables;
           since specifying both is usually accidental, a warning is given if the values are different.

</pre><h4><b>DIRECTORY</b> <b>TREES</b></h4><pre>
       There are a plethora of ways to specify the plethora of directory trees used by  TeX  Live.  By  far  the
       simplest, and recommended, approach is not to change anything. The defaults suffice for the vast majority
       of installations.

       But,  for  the sake of explanation, here is a table of the trees and the command line options that change
       them. The first group of  three  are  system  directories,  and  the  second  group  of  three  are  user
       directories; the two groups are quite analogous.

         +----------------+--------------------------------------+--------------+------------------+
         |    tree        | default                              | group change | single change    |
         +----------------+--------------------------------------+--------------+------------------+
         | TEXMFLOCAL     | /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local       | --texdir     | --texmflocal     |
         | TEXMFSYSVAR    | /usr/local/texlive/YYYY/texmf-var    | --texdir     | --texmfsysvar    |
         | TEXMFSYSCONFIG | /usr/local/texlive/YYYY/texmf-config | --texdir     | --texmfsysconfig |
         +----------------+--------------------------------------+--------------+------------------+
         | TEXMFHOME      | <a href="file:~/texmf">~/texmf</a>                              | --texuserdir | --texmfhome      |
         | TEXMFVAR       | <a href="file:~/.texliveYYYY/texmf-var">~/.texliveYYYY/texmf-var</a>             | --texuserdir | --texmfvar       |
         | TEXMFCONFIG    | <a href="file:~/.texliveYYYY/texmf-config">~/.texliveYYYY/texmf-config</a>          | --texuserdir | --texmfconfig    |
         +----------------+--------------------------------------+--------------+------------------+

       In   addition,   as   mentioned   in  the  previous  section,  each  tree  has  an  environment  variable
       "TEXLIVE_INSTALL_"<u>tree</u> which overrides the default; command  line  and  profile  settings  both  override
       environment variable settings.

       The defaults vary slightly on Macs, as explained above in "OPTIONS".

       For  the  user  trees, the default value uses "~", and this is left as a literal "~" in "texmf.cnf". That
       way, each user can have their own "TEXMFHOME", etc., as intended. On  the  other  hand,  for  the  system
       trees,  if  "~" is used during the installation, this is assumed to simply be a typing shorthand, and the
       expanded home directory is written in "texmf.cnf", since it doesn't  make  sense  to  have  user-specific
       system directories.

       For  more  on  the  directory  trees  and  their  intended  usage, see the main TeX Live documentation at
       &lt;https://tug.org/texlive/doc&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The "install-tl" script copies itself into the installed tree.  Usually, it can be run from there,  using
       the  installed  tree  as  the  source  for  another  installation.   Occasionally,  however, there may be
       incompatibilities in the code of the new "install-tl" and the  infrastructure,  resulting  in  (probably)
       inscrutable  Perl  errors.   The  way  forward  is  to  run  "install-tl"  out  of  the installer package
       ("install-tl-unx.tar.gz" or "install-tl.zip") instead of the installation. Feel free to also  report  the
       issue; usually the code can be easily synced up again.

       By  the  way,  do  not  try  to  use  "install-tl" to adjust options or installed packages in an existing
       installed tree. Use "tlmgr" instead.
