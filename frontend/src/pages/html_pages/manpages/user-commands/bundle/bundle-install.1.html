       <b>bundle-install</b> - Install the dependencies specified in your Gemfile

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bundle</b>    <b>install</b>    [--binstubs[=DIRECTORY]]    [--clean]   [--deployment]   [--frozen]   [--full-index]
       [--gemfile=GEMFILE] [--jobs=NUMBER] [--local] [--no-cache] [--no-prune]  [--path  PATH]  [--prefer-local]
       [--quiet]   [--redownload]   [--retry=NUMBER]   [--shebang=SHEBANG]   [--standalone[=GROUP[   GROUP...]]]
       [--system] [--trust-policy=TRUST-POLICY]  [--target-rbconfig=TARGET-RBCONFIG]  [--with=GROUP[  GROUP...]]
       [--without=GROUP[ GROUP...]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Install  the  gems  specified in your <a href="../man5/Gemfile.5.html">Gemfile</a>(5). If this is the first time you run bundle install (and a
       <b>Gemfile.lock</b> does not exist), Bundler will fetch all remote sources, resolve dependencies and install all
       needed gems.

       If a <b>Gemfile.lock</b> does exist, and you have not updated your <a href="../man5/Gemfile.5.html">Gemfile</a>(5), Bundler  will  fetch  all  remote
       sources, but use the dependencies specified in the <b>Gemfile.lock</b> instead of resolving dependencies.

       If  a <b>Gemfile.lock</b> does exist, and you have updated your <a href="../man5/Gemfile.5.html">Gemfile</a>(5), Bundler will use the dependencies in
       the <b>Gemfile.lock</b> for all gems that you did not update, but will re-resolve the dependencies of gems  that
       you  did  update.  You  can  find  more  information  about  this update process below under <u>CONSERVATIVE</u>
       <u>UPDATING</u>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>--clean</b>, <b>--deployment</b>, <b>--frozen</b>,  <b>--no-prune</b>,  <b>--path</b>,  <b>--shebang</b>,  <b>--system</b>,  <b>--without</b>  and  <b>--with</b>
       options  are  deprecated  because  they  only  make  sense if they are applied to every subsequent <b>bundle</b>
       <b>install</b> run automatically and that requires <b>bundler</b> to silently remember  them.  Since  <b>bundler</b>  will  no
       longer  remember  CLI  flags  in  future versions, <b>bundle</b> <b>config</b> (see <a href="../man1/bundle-config.1.html">bundle-config</a>(1)) should be used to
       apply them permanently.

       <b>--binstubs[=BINSTUBS]</b>
              Binstubs are scripts that wrap around executables. Bundler creates a small Ruby file  (a  binstub)
              that  loads  Bundler, runs the command, and puts it in <b>bin/</b>. This lets you link the binstub inside
              of an application to the exact gem version the application needs.

              Creates a directory (defaults to <b><a href="file:~/bin">~/bin</a></b> when the option is used without a value, or  to  the  given
              <b>&lt;BINSTUBS&gt;</b>  directory  otherwise) and places any executables from the gem there. These executables
              run in Bundler's context. If used, you  might  add  this  directory  to  your  environment's  <b>PATH</b>
              variable.  For  instance,  if the <b>rails</b> gem comes with a <b>rails</b> executable, this flag will create a
              <b>bin/rails</b> executable that ensures that all  referred  dependencies  will  be  resolved  using  the
              bundled gems.

       <b>--clean</b>
              On  finishing  the  installation  Bundler  is  going to remove any gems not present in the current
              <a href="../man5/Gemfile.5.html">Gemfile</a>(5). Don't worry, gems currently in use will not be removed.

              This option is deprecated in favor of the <b>clean</b> setting.

       <b>--deployment</b>
              In <u>deployment</u> <u>mode</u>, Bundler will 'roll-out' the bundle for production  or  CI  use.  Please  check
              carefully if you want to have this option enabled in your development environment.

              This option is deprecated in favor of the <b>deployment</b> setting.

       <b>--redownload</b>, <b>--force</b>
              Force download every gem, even if the required versions are already available locally.

       <b>--frozen</b>
              Do  not allow the Gemfile.lock to be updated after this install. Exits non-zero if there are going
              to be changes to the Gemfile.lock.

              This option is deprecated in favor of the <b>frozen</b> setting.

       <b>--full-index</b>
              Bundler will not call Rubygems' API endpoint (default) but download and cache  a  (currently  big)
              index  file  of  all  gems.  Performance  can  be improved for large bundles that seldom change by
              enabling this option.

       <b>--gemfile=GEMFILE</b>
              The location of the <a href="../man5/Gemfile.5.html">Gemfile</a>(5) which Bundler should use. This defaults  to  a  <a href="../man5/Gemfile.5.html">Gemfile</a>(5)  in  the
              current  working directory. In general, Bundler will assume that the location of the <a href="../man5/Gemfile.5.html">Gemfile</a>(5) is
              also the project's root and will try to  find  <b>Gemfile.lock</b>  and  <b>vendor/cache</b>  relative  to  this
              location.

       <b>--jobs=&lt;number&gt;</b>, <b>-j=&lt;number&gt;</b>
              The  maximum  number of parallel download and install jobs. The default is the number of available
              processors.

       <b>--local</b>
              Do not attempt to connect to <b>rubygems.org</b>. Instead, Bundler will use the gems already  present  in
              Rubygems'  cache  or  in <b>vendor/cache</b>. Note that if an appropriate platform-specific gem exists on
              <b>rubygems.org</b> it will not be found.

       <b>--prefer-local</b>
              Force using locally installed gems, or gems already present in Rubygems' cache or in <b>vendor/cache</b>,
              when resolving, even if newer  versions  are  available  remotely.  Only  attempt  to  connect  to
              <b>rubygems.org</b> for gems that are not present locally.

       <b>--no-cache</b>
              Do not update the cache in <b>vendor/cache</b> with the newly bundled gems. This does not remove any gems
              in the cache but keeps the newly bundled gems from being cached during the install.

       <b>--no-prune</b>
              Don't remove stale gems from the cache when the installation finishes.

              This option is deprecated in favor of the <b>no_prune</b> setting.

       <b>--path=PATH</b>
              The  location to install the specified gems to. This defaults to Rubygems' setting. Bundler shares
              this location with Rubygems, <b>gem</b> <b>install</b> <b>...</b> will have gem installed there, too.  Therefore,  gems
              installed  without  a  <b>--path</b>  <b>...</b>  setting  will  show  up by calling <b>gem</b> <b>list</b>. Accordingly, gems
              installed to other locations will not get listed.

              This option is deprecated in favor of the <b>path</b> setting.

       <b>--quiet</b>
              Do not print progress information to the standard output.

       <b>--retry=[&lt;number&gt;]</b>
              Retry failed network or git requests for <u>number</u> times.

       <b>--shebang=SHEBANG</b>
              Uses the specified ruby executable (usually <b>ruby</b>) to execute the scripts created with  <b>--binstubs</b>.
              In addition, if you use <b>--binstubs</b> together with <b>--shebang</b> <b>jruby</b> these executables will be changed
              to execute <b>jruby</b> instead.

              This option is deprecated in favor of the <b>shebang</b> setting.

       <b>--standalone[=&lt;list&gt;]</b>
              Makes  a  bundle  that  can  work  without  depending  on  Rubygems or Bundler at runtime. A space
              separated list of groups to install can be specified. Bundler creates a directory named <b>bundle</b> and
              installs the bundle there. It also generates a <b>bundle/bundler/setup.rb</b> file to  replace  Bundler's
              own  setup  in the manner required. Using this option implicitly sets <b>path</b>, which is a [remembered
              option][REMEMBERED OPTIONS].

       <b>--system</b>
              Installs the gems specified in the bundle to the system's Rubygems location.  This  overrides  any
              previous configuration of <b>--path</b>.

              This option is deprecated in favor of the <b>system</b> setting.

       <b>--trust-policy=TRUST-POLICY</b>
              Apply  the  Rubygems  security policy <u>policy</u>, where policy is one of <b>HighSecurity</b>, <b>MediumSecurity</b>,
              <b>LowSecurity</b>, <b>AlmostNoSecurity</b>, or <b>NoSecurity</b>. For more details, please see  the  Rubygems  signing
              documentation linked below in <u>SEE</u> <u>ALSO</u>.

       <b>--target-rbconfig=TARGET-RBCONFIG</b>
              Path to rbconfig.rb for the deployment target platform.

       <b>--with=&lt;list&gt;</b>
              A  space-separated list of groups referencing gems to install. If an optional group is given it is
              installed. If a group is given that is in the remembered list of groups given to --without, it  is
              removed from that list.

              This option is deprecated in favor of the <b>with</b> setting.

       <b>--without=&lt;list&gt;</b>
              A space-separated list of groups referencing gems to skip during installation. If a group is given
              that is in the remembered list of groups given to --with, it is removed from that list.

              This option is deprecated in favor of the <b>without</b> setting.

</pre><h4><b>DEPLOYMENT</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       Bundler's  defaults are optimized for development. To switch to defaults optimized for deployment and for
       CI, use the <b>--deployment</b> flag. Do not activate deployment mode on development machines, as it will  cause
       an error when the <a href="../man5/Gemfile.5.html">Gemfile</a>(5) is modified.

       1.  A <b>Gemfile.lock</b> is required.

           To  ensure  that  the  same  versions of the gems you developed with and tested with are also used in
           deployments, a <b>Gemfile.lock</b> is required.

           This is mainly to ensure that you remember to check your <b>Gemfile.lock</b> into version control.

       2.  The <b>Gemfile.lock</b> must be up to date

           In development, you can modify your <a href="../man5/Gemfile.5.html">Gemfile</a>(5) and re-run <b>bundle</b>  <b>install</b>  to  <u>conservatively</u>  <u>update</u>
           your <b>Gemfile.lock</b> snapshot.

           In deployment, your <b>Gemfile.lock</b> should be up-to-date with changes made in your <a href="../man5/Gemfile.5.html">Gemfile</a>(5).

       3.  Gems are installed to <b>vendor/bundle</b> not your default system location

           In  development,  it's  convenient to share the gems used in your application with other applications
           and other scripts that run on the system.

           In deployment, isolation is a more important default. In addition, the user deploying the application
           may not have permission to install gems to the system, or the web server may not have  permission  to
           read them.

           As  a  result,  <b>bundle</b>  <b>install</b>  <b>--deployment</b>  installs  gems  to  the <b>vendor/bundle</b> directory in the
           application. This may be overridden using the <b>--path</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLING</b> <b>GROUPS</b></h4><pre>
       By default, <b>bundle</b> <b>install</b> will install all gems in all groups in your <a href="../man5/Gemfile.5.html">Gemfile</a>(5), except those  declared
       for a different platform.

       However,  you  can  explicitly  tell Bundler to skip installing certain groups with the <b>--without</b> option.
       This option takes a space-separated list of groups.

       While the <b>--without</b> option will skip <u>installing</u> the gems in the specified groups, it will still  <u>download</u>
       those gems and use them to resolve the dependencies of every gem in your <a href="../man5/Gemfile.5.html">Gemfile</a>(5).

       This  is  so  that  installing a different set of groups on another machine (such as a production server)
       will not change the gems and versions that you have already developed and tested against.

       <b>Bundler</b> <b>offers</b> <b>a</b> <b>rock-solid</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>third-party</b>  <b>code</b>  <b>you</b>  <b>are</b>  <b>running</b>  <b>in</b>  <b>development</b>  <b>and</b>
       <b>testing</b>  <b>is</b>  <b>also</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>third-party</b> <b>code</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> <b>in</b> <b>production.</b> <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> <b>exclude</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b>
       <b>that</b> <b>code</b> <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>environments,</b> <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> <b>flat-footed</b> <b>by</b>  <b>different</b>  <b>versions</b>  <b>of</b>
       <b>third-party</b> <b>code</b> <b>being</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>environments.</b>

       For a simple illustration, consider the following <a href="../man5/Gemfile.5.html">Gemfile</a>(5):

           source 'https://rubygems.org'

           gem 'sinatra'

           group :production do
             gem 'rack-perftools-profiler'
           end

       In  this  case, <b>sinatra</b> depends on any version of Rack (<b>&gt;=</b> <b>1.0</b>), while <b>rack-perftools-profiler</b> depends on
       1.x (<b>~&gt;</b> <b>1.0</b>).

       When you run <b>bundle</b> <b>install</b>  <b>--without</b>  <b>production</b>  in  development,  we  look  at  the  dependencies  of
       <b>rack-perftools-profiler</b>  as  well.  That way, you do not spend all your time developing against Rack 2.0,
       using new APIs unavailable in Rack 1.x, only to have Bundler switch to Rack 1.2 when the <b>production</b> group
       <u>is</u> used.

       This should not cause any problems in practice, because we do not attempt to  <b>install</b>  the  gems  in  the
       excluded groups, and only evaluate as part of the dependency resolution process.

       This  also  means that you cannot include different versions of the same gem in different groups, because
       doing so would result in different sets of dependencies used in development and  production.  Because  of
       the  vagaries  of  the dependency resolution process, this usually affects more than the gems you list in
       your <a href="../man5/Gemfile.5.html">Gemfile</a>(5), and can (surprisingly) radically change the gems you are using.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>GEMFILE.LOCK</b></h4><pre>
       When you run <b>bundle</b> <b>install</b>, Bundler will persist the full names and versions of all gems that  you  used
       (including dependencies of the gems specified in the <a href="../man5/Gemfile.5.html">Gemfile</a>(5)) into a file called <b>Gemfile.lock</b>.

       Bundler  uses  this  file in all subsequent calls to <b>bundle</b> <b>install</b>, which guarantees that you always use
       the same exact code, even as your application moves across machines.

       Because of the way dependency resolution works, even a seemingly small change (for instance, an update to
       a point-release of a dependency of a gem in your <a href="../man5/Gemfile.5.html">Gemfile</a>(5)) can result in radically different gems being
       needed to satisfy all dependencies.

       As a result, you <b>SHOULD</b> check your <b>Gemfile.lock</b> into version control, in both applications and  gems.  If
       you do not, every machine that checks out your repository (including your production server) will resolve
       all  dependencies again, which will result in different versions of third-party code being used if <b>any</b> of
       the gems in the <a href="../man5/Gemfile.5.html">Gemfile</a>(5) or any of their dependencies have been updated.

       When Bundler first shipped, the <b>Gemfile.lock</b> was included in the <b>.gitignore</b> file included with  generated
       gems.  Over time, however, it became clear that this practice forces the pain of broken dependencies onto
       new contributors, while leaving existing contributors potentially unaware of the  problem.  Since  <b>bundle</b>
       <b>install</b>  is  usually  the  first  step  towards  a  contribution,  the  pain of broken dependencies would
       discourage new contributors from contributing. As a result, we have revised our guidance for gem  authors
       to now recommend checking in the lock for gems.

</pre><h4><b>CONSERVATIVE</b> <b>UPDATING</b></h4><pre>
       When  you  make a change to the <a href="../man5/Gemfile.5.html">Gemfile</a>(5) and then run <b>bundle</b> <b>install</b>, Bundler will update only the gems
       that you modified.

       In other words, if a gem that you <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>modify</b>  worked  before  you  called  <b>bundle</b>  <b>install</b>,  it  will
       continue to use the exact same versions of all dependencies as it used before the update.

       Let's take a look at an example. Here's your original <a href="../man5/Gemfile.5.html">Gemfile</a>(5):

           source 'https://rubygems.org'

           gem 'actionpack', '2.3.8'
           gem 'activemerchant'

       In  this  case, both <b>actionpack</b> and <b>activemerchant</b> depend on <b>activesupport</b>. The <b>actionpack</b> gem depends on
       <b>activesupport</b> <b>2.3.8</b> and <b>rack</b> <b>~&gt;</b> <b>1.1.0</b>, while the <b>activemerchant</b> gem depends on  <b>activesupport</b>  <b>&gt;=</b>  <b>2.3.2</b>,
       <b>braintree</b> <b>&gt;=</b> <b>2.0.0</b>, and <b>builder</b> <b>&gt;=</b> <b>2.0.0</b>.

       When  the  dependencies  are first resolved, Bundler will select <b>activesupport</b> <b>2.3.8</b>, which satisfies the
       requirements of both gems in your <a href="../man5/Gemfile.5.html">Gemfile</a>(5).

       Next, you modify your <a href="../man5/Gemfile.5.html">Gemfile</a>(5) to:

           source 'https://rubygems.org'

           gem 'actionpack', '3.0.0.rc'
           gem 'activemerchant'

       The <b>actionpack</b> <b>3.0.0.rc</b> gem has a number of new dependencies, and updates the <b>activesupport</b> dependency to
       <b>=</b> <b>3.0.0.rc</b> and the <b>rack</b> dependency to <b>~&gt;</b> <b>1.2.1</b>.

       When you run <b>bundle</b>  <b>install</b>,  Bundler  notices  that  you  changed  the  <b>actionpack</b>  gem,  but  not  the
       <b>activemerchant</b> gem. It evaluates the gems currently being used to satisfy its requirements:

       <b>activesupport</b> <b>2.3.8</b>
              also used to satisfy a dependency in <b>activemerchant</b>, which is not being updated

       <b>rack</b> <b>~&gt;</b> <b>1.1.0</b>
              not currently being used to satisfy another dependency

       Because  you  did  not  explicitly ask to update <b>activemerchant</b>, you would not expect it to suddenly stop
       working after updating <b>actionpack</b>. However, satisfying  the  new  <b>activesupport</b>  <b>3.0.0.rc</b>  dependency  of
       actionpack requires updating one of its dependencies.

       Even  though  <b>activemerchant</b>  declares  a  very loose dependency that theoretically matches <b>activesupport</b>
       <b>3.0.0.rc</b>, Bundler treats gems in your <a href="../man5/Gemfile.5.html">Gemfile</a>(5) that have not changed as an atomic  unit  together  with
       their  dependencies.  In  this  case,  the <b>activemerchant</b> dependency is treated as <b>activemerchant</b> <b>1.7.1</b> <b>+</b>
       <b>activesupport</b> <b>2.3.8</b>, so <b>bundle</b> <b>install</b> will report that it cannot update <b>actionpack</b>.

       To explicitly update <b>actionpack</b>, including its dependencies which other  gems  in  the  <a href="../man5/Gemfile.5.html">Gemfile</a>(5)  still
       depend on, run <b>bundle</b> <b>update</b> <b>actionpack</b> (see <b>bundle</b> <b><a href="../man1/update.1.html">update</a>(1)</b>).

       <b>Summary</b>:  In  general,  after  making  a  change  to  the <a href="../man5/Gemfile.5.html">Gemfile</a>(5) , you should first try to run <b>bundle</b>
       <b>install</b>, which will guarantee that no other gem in the <a href="../man5/Gemfile.5.html">Gemfile</a>(5) is impacted by the change. If that does
       not work, run bundle <a href="../man1/update.1.html">update</a>(1) <u>bundle-update.1.html</u>.
