</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dccpclo - DCCP-based BP convergence layer output task

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dccpclo</b> <u>remote_hostname</u>[:<u>remote_port_nbr</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dccpclo</b> is a background "daemon" task that connects to a remote node's DCCP socket at <u>remote_hostname</u> and
       <u>remote_port_nbr</u>. It then begins extracting bundles from the queues of bundles ready for transmission via
       DCCP to this remote bundle protocol agent and transmitting those bundles as DCCP datagrams to the remote
       host.

       If not specified, <u>remote_port_nbr</u> defaults to 4556.

       Note that <b>dccpclo</b> is not a "promiscuous" convergence layer daemon: it can transmit bundles only to the
       node to which it is connected, so scheme configuration directives that cite this outduct need only
       provide the protocol name and the outduct name as specified on the command line when <b>dccpclo</b> is started.

       Note also that <b>dccpclo</b> has no fragmentation support at all. Therefore, the largest bundle that can be
       sent via this convergence layer is limited to just under the link's MTU (typically 1500 bytes).

       <b>dccpclo</b> is spawned automatically by <b>bpadmin</b> in response to the 's' (START) command that starts operation
       of the Bundle Protocol, and it is terminated by <b>bpadmin</b> in response to an 'x' (STOP) command.  <b>dccpclo</b>
       can also be spawned and terminated in response to START and STOP commands that pertain specifically to
       the DCCP convergence layer protocol.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       "0" <b>dccpclo</b>  terminated  normally,  for  reasons  noted in the <b>ion.log</b> file.  If this termination was not
           commanded, investigate and solve the problem identified in the log file and use  <b>bpadmin</b>  to  restart
           <b>dccpclo</b>.

       "1" <b>dccpclo</b>  terminated  abnormally,  for  reasons  noted in the <b>ion.log</b> file.  Investigate and solve the
           problem identified in the log file, then use <b>bpadmin</b> to restart <b>dccpclo</b>.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       No configuration files are needed.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       No environment variables apply.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       The following diagnostics may be issued to the <b>ion.log</b> log file:

       dccpclo can't attach to BP.
           <b>bpadmin</b> has not yet initialized Bundle Protocol operations.

       No memory for DCCP buffer in dccpclo.
           ION system error.  Check errtext, correct problem, and restart <b>dccpclo</b>.

       No such dccp duct.
           No DCCP outduct matching <u>local_hostname</u> and <u>local_port_nbr</u> has been added to the  BP  database.   Use
           <b>bpadmin</b> to stop the DCCP convergence-layer protocol, add the outduct, and then restart <b>dccpclo</b>.

       CLO task is already started for this duct.
           Redundant initiation of <b>dccpclo</b>.

       dccpclo can't get IP address for host.
           Operating system error.  Check errtext, correct problem, and restart <b>dccpclo</b>.

       dccpclo can't create thread.
           Operating system error.  Check errtext, correct problem, and restart <b>dccpclo</b>.

       CLO can't open DCCP socket. This probably means DCCP is not supported on your system.
           Operating  system error. This probably means that you are not using an operating system that supports
           DCCP. Make sure that you are using a current Linux  kernel  and  that  the  DCCP  modules  are  being
           compiled. Check errtext, correct problem, and restart <b>dccpclo</b>.

       CLO can't initialize socket.
           Operating system error.  Check errtext, correct problem, and restart <b>dccpclo</b>.

       CLO <u>send()</u> error on socket.
           Operating system error.  Check errtext, correct problem, and restart <b>dccpclo</b>.

       Bundle is too big for DCCP CLO.
           Configuration  error:  bundles that are too large for DCCP transmission (i.e., larger than the MTU of
           the link or 65535 bytes--whichever is smaller) are being enqueued for <b>dccpclo</b>.  Change routing or use
           smaller bundles.
