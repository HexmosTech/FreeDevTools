</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       bptrace - Bundle Protocol (BP) network trace utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bptrace</b> <u>own_endpoint_ID</u> <u>destination_endpoint_ID</u> <u>report-to_endpoint_ID</u> <u>TTL</u> <u>class_of_service</u> "<u>trace_text</u>"
       [<u>status_report_flags</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bptrace</b> uses <u>bp_send()</u> to issue a single bundle to a designated destination endpoint, with status
       reporting options enabled as selected by the user, then terminates.  The status reports returned as the
       bundle makes its way through the network provide a view of the operation of the network as currently
       configured.

       <u>TTL</u> indicates the number of seconds the trace bundle may remain in the network, undelivered, before it is
       automatically destroyed.

       <u>class_of_service</u> is <u>custody-requested</u>.<u>priority</u>[.<u>ordinal</u>[.<u>unreliable</u>.<u>critical</u>[.<u>flow-label</u>]]], where
       <u>custody-requested</u> must be 0 or 1 (Boolean), <u>priority</u> must be 0 (bulk) or 1 (standard) or 2 (expedited),
       <u>ordinal</u> must be 0-254, <u>unreliable</u> must be 0 or 1 (Boolean), <u>critical</u> must also be 0 or 1 (Boolean), and
       <u>flow-label</u> may be any unsigned integer.  <u>ordinal</u> is ignored if <u>priority</u> is not 2.  Setting
       <u>class_of_service</u> to "0.2.254" or "1.2.254" gives a bundle the highest possible priority.  Setting
       <u>unreliable</u> to 1 causes BP to forego retransmission in the event of data loss, both at the BP layer and at
       the convergence layer.  Setting <u>critical</u> to 1 causes contact graph routing to forward the bundle on all
       plausible routes rather than just the "best" route it computes; this may result in multiple copies of the
       bundle arriving at the destination endpoint, but when used in conjunction with priority 2.254 it ensures
       that the bundle will be delivered as soon as physically possible.

       <u>trace_text</u> can be any string of ASCII text; alternatively, if we want to send a file, it can be "@"
       followed by the file name.

       <u>status_report_flags</u> must be a sequence of status report flags, separated by commas, with no embedded
       whitespace.  Each status report flag must be one of the following: rcv, ct, fwd, dlv, del.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       "0" <b>bptrace</b> has terminated.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       No configuration files are needed.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       No environment variables apply.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       The following diagnostics may be issued to the <b>ion.log</b> log file:

       bptrace can't attach to BP.
           <b>bpadmin</b> has not yet initialized BP operations.

       bptrace can't open own endpoint.
           Another  BP application task currently has <u>own_endpoint_ID</u> open for bundle origination and reception.
           Try again after that task has terminated.  If no such task exists, it may have  crashed  while  still
           holding the endpoint open; the easiest workaround is to select a different source endpoint.

       No space for bptrace text.
           Probably an unrecoverable database error, in which case the local ION node must be terminated and re-
           initialized.

       bptrace can't create ZCO.
           Probably an unrecoverable database error, in which case the local ION node must be terminated and re-
           initialized.

       bptrace can't send message.
           BP  system  error.   Check for earlier diagnostic messages describing the cause of the error; correct
           problem and rerun.
