</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       bpdriver - Bundle Protocol transmission test program

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bpdriver</b> <u>nbrOfCycles</u> <u>ownEndpointId</u> <u>destinationEndpointId</u> [<u>length</u>] [t<u>TTL</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bpdriver</b> uses Bundle Protocol to send <u>nbrOfCycles</u> application data units of length indicated by <u>length</u>,
       to a counterpart application task that has opened the BP endpoint identified by <u>destinationEndpointId</u>.

       If omitted, <u>length</u> defaults to 60000.

       <u>TTL</u> indicates the number of seconds the bundles may remain in the network, undelivered, before they are
       automatically destroyed. If omitted, <u>TTL</u> defaults to 300 seconds.

       <b>bpdriver</b> normally runs in "echo" mode: after sending each bundle it waits for an acknowledgment bundle
       before sending the next one.  For this purpose, the counterpart application task should be <b>bpecho</b>.

       Alternatively <b>bpdriver</b> can run in "streaming" mode, i.e., without expecting or receiving acknowledgments.
       Streaming mode is enabled when <u>length</u> is specified as a negative number, in which case the additive
       inverse of <u>length</u> is used as the effective value of <u>length</u>.  For this purpose, the counterpart
       application task should be <b>bpcounter</b>.

       If the effective value of <u>length</u> is 1, the sizes of the transmitted service data units will be randomly
       selected multiples of 1024 in the range 1024 to 62464.

       <b>bpdriver</b> normally runs with custody transfer disabled.  To request custody transfer for all bundles sent
       by <b>bpdriver</b>, specify <u>nbrOfCycles</u> as a negative number; the additive inverse of <u>nbrOfCycles</u> will be used
       as its effective value in this case.

       When all copies of the file have been sent, <b>bpdriver</b> prints a performance report.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       "0" <b>bpdriver</b>  has terminated.  Any problems encountered during operation will be noted in the <b>ion.log</b> log
           file.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The service data units transmitted by <b>bpdriver</b> are sequences of text obtained from a file in the  current
       working directory named "bpdriverAduFile", which <b>bpdriver</b> creates automatically.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       No environment variables apply.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Diagnostic messages produced by <b>bpdriver</b> are written to the ION log file <u>ion.log</u>.

       Can't attach to BP.
           <b>bpadmin</b> has not yet initialized Bundle Protocol operations.

       Can't open own endpoint.
           Another application has already opened <u>ownEndpointId</u>.  Terminate that application and rerun.

       Can't create ADU file
           Operating system error.  Check errtext, correct problem, and rerun.

       Error writing to ADU file
           Operating system error.  Check errtext, correct problem, and rerun.

       bpdriver can't create file ref.
           ION  system  error.  Check for earlier diagnostic messages describing the cause of the error; correct
           problem and rerun.

       bpdriver can't create ZCO.
           ION system error.  Check for earlier diagnostic messages describing the cause of the  error;  correct
           problem and rerun.

       bpdriver can't send message
           Bundle Protocol service to the remote endpoint has been stopped.

       bpdriver reception failed
           <b>bpdriver</b> is in "echo" mode, and Bundle Protocol delivery service has been stopped.
