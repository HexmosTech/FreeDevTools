</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       bssfw - bundle route computation task for the IPN scheme, adapted for Bundle Streaming Service

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bssfw</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bssfw</b> is a background "daemon" task that pops bundles from the queue of bundle destined for IPN-scheme
       endpoints, computes proximate destinations for those bundles, and appends those bundles to the
       appropriate queues of bundles pending transmission to those computed proximate destinations.

       For each possible proximate destination (that is, neighboring node) there is a separate queue for each
       possible level of bundle priority: 0, 1, 2.  Each outbound bundle is appended to the queue matching the
       bundle's designated priority.

       Proximate destination computation is affected by static and default routes as configured by <u><a href="../man1/bssadmin.1.html">bssadmin</a></u>(1)
       and by contact graphs as managed by <u><a href="../man1/ionadmin.1.html">ionadmin</a></u>(1) and <u><a href="../man1/rfxclock.1.html">rfxclock</a></u>(1).  <b>bssfw</b> differs from <b>ipnfw</b> in this way: a
       bundle that is destined for an endpoint associated with a BSS application (as registered in an "entry"
       passed to <u><a href="../man1/bssadmin.1.html">bssadmin</a></u>(1) in a <u><a href="../man5/bssrc.5.html">bssrc</a></u>(5) command) is forwarded via a duct identified in a separately defined
       real-time or playback duct expression, rather than the standard duct that is used for non-BSS traffic.

       <b>bssfw</b> is spawned automatically by <b>bpadmin</b> in response to the 's' (START) command that starts operation of
       Bundle Protocol on the local ION node, and it is terminated by <b>bpadmin</b> in response to an 'x' (STOP)
       command.  <b>bssfw</b> can also be spawned and terminated in response to START and STOP commands that pertain
       specifically to the IPN scheme.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       "0" <b>bssfw</b>  terminated, for reasons noted in the <b>ion.log</b> log file.  If this termination was not commanded,
           investigate and solve the problem identified in the log file and use <b>bpadmin</b> to restart <b>bssfw</b>.

       "1" <b>bssfw</b> could not commence operations, for reasons noted in the  <b>ion.log</b>  log  file.   Investigate  and
           solve the problem identified in the log file, then use <b>bpadmin</b> to restart <b>bssfw</b>.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       No configuration files are needed.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       No environment variables apply.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       The following diagnostics may be issued to the <b>ion.log</b> log file:

       bssfw can't attach to BP.
           <b>bpadmin</b> has not yet initialized BP operations.

       bssfw can't load routing database.
           <b>bssadmin</b> has not yet initialized the IPN scheme.

       Can't create lists for route computation.
           An unrecoverable database error was encountered.  <b>bssfw</b> terminates.

       'bss' scheme is unknown.
           The  IPN  scheme  was not added when <b>bpadmin</b> initialized BP operations.  Use <b>bpadmin</b> to add and start
           the scheme.

       Can't take forwarder semaphore.
           ION system error.  <b>bssfw</b> terminates.

       Can't exclude sender from routes.
           An unrecoverable database error was encountered.  <b>bssfw</b> terminates.

       Can't enqueue bundle.
           An unrecoverable database error was encountered.  <b>bssfw</b> terminates.
