</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dtn2fw - bundle route computation task for the "dtn" scheme

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dtn2fw</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dtn2fw</b> is a background "daemon" task that pops bundles from the queue of bundle destined for "dtn"-scheme
       endpoints, computes proximate destinations for those bundles, and appends those bundles to the
       appropriate queues of bundles pending transmission to those computed proximate destinations.

       For each possible proximate destination (that is, neighboring node) there is a separate queue for each
       possible level of bundle priority: 0, 1, 2.  Each outbound bundle is appended to the queue matching the
       bundle's designated priority.

       Proximate destination computation is affected by static routes as configured by <u><a href="../man1/dtn2admin.1.html">dtn2admin</a></u>(1).

       <b>dtn2fw</b> is spawned automatically by <b>bpadmin</b> in response to the 's' (START) command that starts operation
       of Bundle Protocol on the local ION node, and it is terminated by <b>bpadmin</b> in response to an 'x' (STOP)
       command.  <b>dtn2fw</b> can also be spawned and terminated in response to START and STOP commands that pertain
       specifically to the "dtn" scheme.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       "0" <b>dtn2fw</b> terminated, for reasons noted in the <b>ion.log</b> log file.  If this termination was not commanded,
           investigate and solve the problem identified in the log file and use <b>bpadmin</b> to restart <b>dtn2fw</b>.

       "1" <b>dtn2fw</b>  could  not  commence  operations, for reasons noted in the <b>ion.log</b> log file.  Investigate and
           solve the problem identified in the log file, then use <b>bpadmin</b> to restart <b>dtn2fw</b>.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       No configuration files are needed.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       No environment variables apply.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       The following diagnostics may be issued to the <b>ion.log</b> log file:

       dtn2fw can't attach to BP.
           <b>bpadmin</b> has not yet initialized BP operations.

       dtn2fw can't load routing database.
           <b>dtn2admin</b> has not yet initialized the "dtn" scheme.

       Can't create lists for route computation.
           An unrecoverable database error was encountered.  <b>dtn2fw</b> terminates.

       'dtn' scheme is unknown.
           The "dtn" scheme was not added when <b>bpadmin</b> initialized BP operations.  Use <b>bpadmin</b> to add and  start
           the scheme.

       Can't take forwarder semaphore.
           ION system error.  <b>dtn2fw</b> terminates.

       Can't enqueue bundle.
           An unrecoverable database error was encountered.  <b>dtn2fw</b> terminates.
