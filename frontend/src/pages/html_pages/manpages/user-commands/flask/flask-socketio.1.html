       flask-socketio - flask-socketio Documentation

       <b>Flask-SocketIO</b>  gives  Flask applications access to low latency bi-directional communications between the
       clients and the server. The client-side application can use any  of  the  <u>SocketIO</u>  client  libraries  in
       Javascript,  Python,  C++,  Java  and  Swift,  or  any  other  compatible client to establish a permanent
       connection to the server.

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Installation</b>
       You can install this package in the usual way using <b>pip</b>:

          pip install flask-socketio

   <b>Requirements</b>
       Flask-SocketIO is compatible with Python 3.6+. The asynchronous services that this package relies on  can
       be selected among three choices:

       • <u>eventlet</u> is the best performant option, with support for long-polling and WebSocket transports.

       • <u>gevent</u>  is  supported  in  a  number  of  different configurations. The long-polling transport is fully
         supported with the gevent package, but unlike eventlet, gevent does not have native WebSocket  support.
         To  add support for WebSocket there are currently two options.  Installing the <u>gevent-websocket</u> package
         adds WebSocket support to gevent or one can use the  <u>uWSGI</u>  web  server,  which  comes  with  WebSocket
         functionality. The use of gevent is also a performant option, but slightly lower than eventlet.

       • The  Flask  development  server  based  on  Werkzeug can be used as well, with the caveat that this web
         server is intended only for development use, so it should only be  used  to  simplify  the  development
         workflow and not for production.

       The  extension  automatically  detects  which  asynchronous  framework to use based on what is installed.
       Preference is given to eventlet,  followed  by  gevent.   For  WebSocket  support  in  gevent,  uWSGI  is
       preferred,  followed  by  gevent-websocket.  If neither eventlet nor gevent are installed, then the Flask
       development server is used.

       If using multiple processes, a message  queue  service  must  be  configured  to  allow  the  servers  to
       coordinate  operations  such  as  broadcasting.  The supported queues are <u>Redis</u>, <u>RabbitMQ</u>, <u>Kafka</u>, and any
       other message queues supported by the <u>Kombu</u> package.

       On the client-side, the official  Socket.IO  Javascript  client  library  can  be  used  to  establish  a
       connection  to  the  server.  There  are also official clients written in Swift, Java and C++. Unofficial
       clients may also work, as long as they implement the <u>Socket.IO</u>  <u>protocol</u>.   The  <u>python-socketio</u>  package
       (which provides the Socket.IO server implementation used by Flask-SocketIO) includes a Python client.

   <b>Version</b> <b>compatibility</b>
       The  Socket.IO  protocol  has  been  through a number of revisions, and some of these introduced backward
       incompatible changes, which means that the client  and  the  server  must  use  compatible  versions  for
       everything to work.

       The  version  compatibility  chart  below  maps  versions  of  this package to versions of the JavaScript
       reference implementation and the versions of the Socket.IO and Engine.IO protocols.

</pre><h4><b>GETTING</b> <b>STARTED</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Initialization</b>
       The following code example shows how to add Flask-SocketIO to a Flask application:

          from flask import Flask, render_template
          from flask_socketio import SocketIO

          app = Flask(__name__)
          app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'secret!'
          socketio = SocketIO(app)

          if __name__ == '__main__':
              socketio.run(app)

       The <b>init_app()</b> style of initialization is also supported. To start the web  server  simply  execute  your
       script. Note the way the web server is started.  The <b>socketio.run()</b> function encapsulates the start up of
       the  web  server  and  replaces  the  <b>app.run()</b>  standard  Flask  development  server  start up. When the
       application is in debug mode the Werkzeug development server is still used and configured properly inside
       <b>socketio.run()</b>. In production mode the eventlet web server is used if  available,  else  the  gevent  web
       server is used. If eventlet and gevent are not installed, the Werkzeug development web server is used.

       The  <b>flask</b>  <b>run</b> command introduced in Flask 0.11 can be used to start a Flask-SocketIO development server
       based on Werkzeug, but this method of starting the Flask-SocketIO server is not recommended due  to  lack
       of  WebSocket  support.  Previous versions of this package included a customized version of the <b>flask</b> <b>run</b>
       command that allowed  the  use  of  WebSocket  on  eventlet  and  gevent  production  servers,  but  this
       functionality has been discontinued in favor of the <b>socketio.run(app)</b> startup method shown above which is
       more robust.

       The  application  must  serve  a  page  to  the client that loads the Socket.IO library and establishes a
       connection:

          &lt;script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/4.0.1/socket.io.js" integrity="sha512-q/dWJ3kcmjBLU4Qc47E4A9kTB4m3wuTY7vkFJDTZKjTs8jhyGQnaUrxa0Ytd0ssMZhbNua9hE+E7Qv1j+DyZwA==" crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
          &lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"&gt;
              var socket = io();
              socket.on('connect', function() {
                  socket.emit('my event', {data: 'I\'m connected!'});
              });
          &lt;/script&gt;

   <b>Receiving</b> <b>Messages</b>
       When using SocketIO, messages are received by both parties as  events.  On  the  client  side  Javascript
       callbacks are used. With Flask-SocketIO the server needs to register handlers for these events, similarly
       to how routes are handled by view functions.

       The following example creates a server-side event handler for an unnamed event:

          @socketio.on('message')
          def handle_message(data):
              print('received message: ' + data)

       The above example uses string messages. Another type of unnamed events use JSON data:

          @socketio.on('json')
          def handle_json(json):
              print('received json: ' + str(json))

       The most flexible type of event uses custom event names. The message data for these events can be string,
       bytes, int, or JSON:

          @socketio.on('my event')
          def handle_my_custom_event(json):
              print('received json: ' + str(json))

       Custom named events can also support multiple arguments:

          @socketio.on('my_event')
          def handle_my_custom_event(arg1, arg2, arg3):
              print('received args: ' + arg1 + arg2 + arg3)

       When the name of the event is a valid Python identifier that does not collide with other defined symbols,
       the <b>@socketio.event</b> decorator provides a more compact syntax that takes the event name from the decorated
       function:

          @socketio.event
          def my_custom_event(arg1, arg2, arg3):
              print('received args: ' + arg1 + arg2 + arg3)

       Named events are the most flexible, as they eliminate the need to include additional metadata to describe
       the  message  type.  The  names <b>message</b>, <b>json</b>, <b>connect</b> and <b>disconnect</b> are reserved and cannot be used for
       named events.

       Flask-SocketIO also supports SocketIO namespaces, which allow the client to multiplex several independent
       connections on the same physical socket:

          @socketio.on('my event', namespace='/test')
          def handle_my_custom_namespace_event(json):
              print('received json: ' + str(json))

       When a namespace is not specified a default global namespace with the name <b>'/'</b> is used.

       For cases when a decorator syntax isn't convenient, the <b>on_event</b> method can be used:

          def my_function_handler(data):
              pass

          socketio.on_event('my event', my_function_handler, namespace='/test')

       Clients may request an acknowledgement callback that confirms receipt of a message they sent. Any  values
       returned from the handler function will be passed to the client as arguments in the callback function:

          @socketio.on('my event')
          def handle_my_custom_event(json):
              print('received json: ' + str(json))
              return 'one', 2

       In  the above example, the client callback function will be invoked with two arguments, <b>'one'</b> and <b>2</b>. If a
       handler function does not return any values,  the  client  callback  function  will  be  invoked  without
       arguments.

   <b>Sending</b> <b>Messages</b>
       SocketIO event handlers defined as shown in the previous section can send reply messages to the connected
       client using the <b>send()</b> and <b>emit()</b> functions.

       The following examples bounce received events back to the client that sent them:

          from flask_socketio import send, emit

          @socketio.on('message')
          def <a href="../manmessage/handle_message.message.html">handle_message</a>(message):
              <a href="../manmessage/send.message.html">send</a>(message)

          @socketio.on('json')
          def handle_json(json):
              send(json, json=True)

          @socketio.on('my event')
          def handle_my_custom_event(json):
              emit('my response', json)

       Note how <b>send()</b> and <b>emit()</b> are used for unnamed and named events respectively.

       When  working  with namespaces, <b>send()</b> and <b>emit()</b> use the namespace of the incoming message by default. A
       different namespace can be specified with the optional <b>namespace</b> argument:

          @socketio.on('message')
          def <a href="../manmessage/handle_message.message.html">handle_message</a>(message):
              send(message, namespace='/chat')

          @socketio.on('my event')
          def handle_my_custom_event(json):
              emit('my response', json, namespace='/chat')

       To send an event with multiple arguments, send a tuple:

          @socketio.on('my event')
          def handle_my_custom_event(json):
              emit('my response', ('foo', 'bar', json), namespace='/chat')

       SocketIO supports acknowledgment callbacks that confirm that a message was received by the client:

          def ack():
              print('message was received!')

          @socketio.on('my event')
          def handle_my_custom_event(json):
              emit('my response', json, callback=ack)

       When using callbacks, the Javascript client receives a callback function to invoke upon  receipt  of  the
       message.  After the client application invokes the callback function the server invokes the corresponding
       server-side callback.  If the client-side callback is invoked  with  arguments,  these  are  provided  as
       arguments to the server-side callback as well.

   <b>Broadcasting</b>
       Another  very  useful  feature of SocketIO is the broadcasting of messages.  Flask-SocketIO supports this
       feature with the <b>broadcast=True</b> optional argument to <b>send()</b> and <b>emit()</b>:

          @socketio.on('my event')
          def handle_my_custom_event(data):
              emit('my response', data, broadcast=True)

       When a message is sent with the broadcast option enabled, all clients connected to the namespace  receive
       it,  including  the  sender.  When namespaces are not used, the clients connected to the global namespace
       receive the message. Note that callbacks are not invoked for broadcast messages.

       In all the examples shown until this point the server responds to an event sent by the  client.  But  for
       some  applications,  the  server  needs  to  be  the  originator of a message. This can be useful to send
       notifications to clients of events that originated in the server, for example  in  a  background  thread.
       The <b>socketio.send()</b> and <b>socketio.emit()</b> methods can be used to broadcast to all connected clients:

          def some_function():
              socketio.emit('some event', {'data': 42})

       Note  that <b>socketio.send()</b> and <b>socketio.emit()</b> are not the same functions as the context-aware <b>send()</b> and
       <b>emit()</b>. Also note that in the above usage there is no client context, so <b>broadcast=True</b>  is  assumed  and
       does not need to be specified.

   <b>Rooms</b>
       For  many  applications  it  is necessary to group users into subsets that can be addressed together. The
       best example is a chat application with multiple rooms, where users receive messages  from  the  room  or
       rooms  they  are in, but not from other rooms where other users are. Flask-SocketIO supports this concept
       of rooms through the <b>join_room()</b> and <b>leave_room()</b> functions:

          from flask_socketio import join_room, leave_room

          @socketio.on('join')
          def on_join(data):
              username = data['username']
              room = data['room']
              join_room(room)
              send(username + ' has entered the room.', to=room)

          @socketio.on('leave')
          def on_leave(data):
              username = data['username']
              room = data['room']
              leave_room(room)
              send(username + ' has left the room.', to=room)

       The <b>send()</b> and <b>emit()</b> functions accept an optional <b>to</b> argument that cause the message to be sent  to  all
       the clients that are in the given room.

       All clients are assigned a room when they connect, named with the session ID of the connection, which can
       be  obtained  from  <b>request.sid</b>.  A given client can join any rooms, which can be given any names. When a
       client disconnects it is removed from all the rooms it  was  in.  The  context-free  <b>socketio.send()</b>  and
       <b>socketio.emit()</b> functions also accept a <b>to</b> argument to broadcast to all clients in a room.

       Since  all  clients are assigned a personal room, to address a message to a single client, the session ID
       of the client can be used as the <b>to</b> argument.

   <b>Connection</b> <b>Events</b>
       Flask-SocketIO also dispatches connection and disconnection events. The following example  shows  how  to
       register handlers for them:

          @socketio.on('connect')
          def test_connect(auth):
              emit('my response', {'data': 'Connected'})

          @socketio.on('disconnect')
          def test_disconnect(reason):
              print('Client disconnected, reason:', reason)

       The  <b>auth</b>  argument  in  the connection handler is optional. The client can use it to pass authentication
       data such as tokens in dictionary format. If the client does not  provide  authentication  details,  then
       this  argument  is  set  to <b>None</b>. If the server defines a connection event handler without this argument,
       then any authentication data passed by the client is discarded.

       The connection event  handler  can  return  <b>False</b>  to  reject  the  connection,  or  it  can  also  raise
       <u>ConnectionRefusedError</u>.  This  is  so  that the client can be authenticated at this point. When using the
       exception, any arguments passed to the exception  are  returned  to  the  client  in  the  error  packet.
       Examples:

          from flask_socketio import ConnectionRefusedError

          @socketio.on('connect')
          def connect():
              if not self.authenticate(request.args):
                  raise ConnectionRefusedError('unauthorized!')

       The disconnection event handler receives a <b>reason</b> argument that indicates the cause of the disconnection.
       The <b>flask_socketio.SocketIO.reason</b> member includes constants for all the possible reasons.

       Note that connection and disconnection events are sent individually on each namespace used.

   <b>Class-Based</b> <b>Namespaces</b>
       As  an  alternative to the decorator-based event handlers described above, the event handlers that belong
       to a namespace can be created as methods of a class. The <b>flask_socketio.Namespace</b> is provided as  a  base
       class to create class-based namespaces:

          from flask_socketio import Namespace, emit

          class MyCustomNamespace(Namespace):
              def on_connect(self):
                  pass

              def on_disconnect(self, reason):
                  pass

              def on_my_event(self, data):
                  emit('my_response', data)

          socketio.on_namespace(MyCustomNamespace('/test'))

       When  class-based namespaces are used, any events received by the server are dispatched to a method named
       as the event name with the <b>on_</b> prefix. For example, event <b>my_event</b> will be  handled  by  a  method  named
       <b>on_my_event</b>.  If an event is received for which there is no corresponding method defined in the namespace
       class, then the event is ignored. All event names used in class-based namespaces must use characters that
       are legal in method names.

       As  a convenience to methods defined in a class-based namespace, the namespace instance includes versions
       of several of the methods in the <b>flask_socketio.SocketIO</b> class that default to the proper namespace  when
       the <b>namespace</b> argument is not given.

       If  an  event has a handler in a class-based namespace, and also a decorator-based function handler, only
       the decorated function handler is invoked.

   <b>Error</b> <b>Handling</b>
       Flask-SocketIO can also deal with exceptions:

          @socketio.on_error()        # Handles the default namespace
          def error_handler(e):
              pass

          @socketio.on_error('/chat') # handles the '/chat' namespace
          def error_handler_chat(e):
              pass

          @socketio.on_error_default  # handles all namespaces without an explicit error handler
          def default_error_handler(e):
              pass

       Error handler functions take the exception object as an argument.

       The message and data arguments of the current request  can  also  be  inspected  with  the  <b>request.event</b>
       variable, which is useful for error logging and debugging outside the event handler:

          from flask import request

          @socketio.on("my error event")
          def on_my_event(data):
              raise RuntimeError()

          @socketio.on_error_default
          def default_error_handler(e):
              print(request.event["message"]) # "my error event"
              print(request.event["args"])    # (data,)

   <b>Debugging</b> <b>and</b> <b>Troubleshooting</b>
       To help you debug issues, the server can be configured to output logs to the terminal:

          socketio = SocketIO(logger=True, engineio_logger=True)

       The  <b>logger</b>  argument  controls logging related to the Socket.IO protocol, while <b>engineio_logger</b> controls
       logs that originate in the low-level Engine.IO transport. These arguments can be set to  <b>True</b>  to  output
       logs to <b>stderr</b>, or to an object compatible with Python's <b>logging</b> package where the logs should be emitted
       to. A value of <b>False</b> disables logging.

       Logging  can  help  identify  the  cause of connection problems, 400 responses, bad performance and other
       issues.

</pre><h4><b>IMPLEMENTATION</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> <b>Flask's</b> <b>Context</b> <b>Globals</b>
       Handlers for SocketIO events are different than  handlers  for  routes  and  that  introduces  a  lot  of
       confusion  around  what can and cannot be done in a SocketIO handler. The main difference is that all the
       SocketIO events generated for a client occur in the context of a single long running request.

       In spite of the differences, Flask-SocketIO attempts to make working with SocketIO event handlers  easier
       by  making  the  environment similar to that of a regular HTTP request. The following list describes what
       works and what doesn't:

       • An application context is pushed before invoking an event handler making <b>current_app</b> and <b>g</b> available to
         the handler.

       • A request context is also pushed before invoking a handler, also making <b>request</b> and <b>session</b>  available.
         But  note  that  WebSocket  events do not have individual requests associated with them, so the request
         context that started the connection is pushed for all the events that are dispatched during the life of
         the connection.

       • The <b>request</b> context global is enhanced with a <b>sid</b> member that is set to a unique  session  ID  for  the
         connection. This value is used as an initial room where the client is added.

       • The  <b>request</b>  context  global  is  enhanced with <b>namespace</b> and <b>event</b> members that contain the currently
         handled namespace and event arguments.  The <b>event</b> member is a dictionary with <b>message</b> and <b>args</b> keys.

       • The <b>session</b> context global behaves in a different way than in regular requests.  A  copy  of  the  user
         session at the time the SocketIO connection is established is made available to handlers invoked in the
         context  of  that  connection. If a SocketIO handler modifies the session, the modified session will be
         preserved for future SocketIO handlers, but regular HTTP route handlers will  not  see  these  changes.
         Effectively,  when  a  SocketIO  handler  modifies  the  session,  a  "fork"  of the session is created
         exclusively for these handlers. The technical reason for this limitation  is  that  to  save  the  user
         session  a cookie needs to be sent to the client, and that requires HTTP request and response, which do
         not exist in a SocketIO connection. When using server-side sessions  such  as  those  provided  by  the
         Flask-Session  or Flask-KVSession extensions, changes made to the session in HTTP route handlers can be
         seen by SocketIO handlers, as long as the session is not modified in the SocketIO handlers.

       • The <b>before_request</b> and <b>after_request</b> hooks are not invoked for SocketIO event handlers.

       • SocketIO handlers can take custom decorators, but most Flask decorators will not be appropriate to  use
         for  a  SocketIO  handler,  given  that  there  is  no  concept  of a <b>Response</b> object during a SocketIO
         connection.

   <b>Authentication</b>
       A common need of applications is to validate the identity of  their  users.  The  traditional  mechanisms
       based  on web forms and HTTP requests cannot be used in a SocketIO connection, since there is no place to
       send HTTP requests and responses. If necessary, an application can implement a customized login form that
       sends credentials to the server as a SocketIO message when the submit button is pressed by the user.

       However, in most cases it is more convenient to perform the traditional authentication process before the
       SocketIO connection is established. The user's identity can then be recorded in the user session or in  a
       cookie,  and  later  when  the  SocketIO connection is established that information will be accessible to
       SocketIO event handlers.

       Recent revisions of the Socket.IO protocol include the ability to pass a dictionary  with  authentication
       information  during  the  connection.  This  is an ideal place for the client to include a token or other
       authentication details.  If the client uses this capability, the server will provide this  dictionary  as
       an argument to the <b>connect</b> event handler, as shown above.

   <b>Using</b> <b>Flask-Login</b> <b>with</b> <b>Flask-SocketIO</b>
       Flask-SocketIO  can  access  login  information  maintained  by  <u>Flask-Login</u>. After a regular Flask-Login
       authentication is performed and the <b>login_user()</b> function is called  to  record  the  user  in  the  user
       session, any SocketIO connections will have access to the <b>current_user</b> context variable:

          @socketio.on('connect')
          def connect_handler():
              if current_user.is_authenticated:
                  emit('my response',
                       {'message': '{0} has joined'.format(current_user.name)},
                       broadcast=True)
              else:
                  return False  # not allowed here

       Note  that  the  <b>login_required</b>  decorator  cannot  be  used  with  SocketIO event handlers, but a custom
       decorator that disconnects non-authenticated users can be created as follows:

          import functools
          from flask import request
          from flask_login import current_user
          from flask_socketio import disconnect, emit

          def authenticated_only(f):
              @functools.wraps(f)
              def wrapped(*args, **kwargs):
                  if not current_user.is_authenticated:
                      disconnect()
                  else:
                      return f(*args, **kwargs)
              return wrapped

          @socketio.on('my event')
          @authenticated_only
          def handle_my_custom_event(data):
              emit('my response', {'message': '{0} has joined'.format(current_user.name)},
                   broadcast=True)

</pre><h4><b>DEPLOYMENT</b></h4><pre>
       There are many options to deploy a Flask-SocketIO server, ranging from simple to the insanely complex. In
       this section, the most commonly used options are described.

   <b>Embedded</b> <b>Server</b>
       The simplest deployment strategy is to start the web server by  calling  <b>socketio.run(app)</b>  as  shown  in
       examples  above. This will look through the packages that are installed for the best available web server
       and start the application on it. The current web server choices that are evaluated are  <b>eventlet</b>,  <b>gevent</b>
       and the Flask development server.

       If  eventlet  or  gevent  are  available, <b>socketio.run(app)</b> starts a production-ready server using one of
       these frameworks. If neither of these are installed, then the Flask development web server is  used,  and
       in this case the server is not intended to be used in a production deployment.

       Unfortunately  this option is not available when using gevent with uWSGI. See the uWSGI section below for
       information on this option.

   <b>Gunicorn</b> <b>Web</b> <b>Server</b>
       An alternative to <b>socketio.run(app)</b> is to use <u>gunicorn</u> as  web  server,  using  the  eventlet  or  gevent
       workers.  For  this option, eventlet or gevent need to be installed, in addition to gunicorn. The command
       line that starts the eventlet server via gunicorn is:

          gunicorn --worker-class eventlet -w 1 module:app

       If you prefer to use gevent, the command to start the server is:

          gunicorn -k gevent -w 1 module:app

       When using gunicorn with the gevent worker and the WebSocket support provided  by  gevent-websocket,  the
       command  that  starts  the  server must be changed to select a custom gevent web server that supports the
       WebSocket protocol. The modified command is:

          gunicorn -k geventwebsocket.gunicorn.workers.GeventWebSocketWorker -w 1 module:app

       A third option with Gunicorn is to use the threaded worker, along with the <u>simple-websocket</u>  package  for
       WebSocket  support.  This  is  a  particularly  good  solution for applications that are CPU heavy or are
       otherwise incompatible with eventlet and gevent use of green threads. The command to start a threaded web
       server is:

          gunicorn -w 1 --threads 100 module:app

       In all these commands, <b>module</b> is the Python module or package that defines the application instance,  and
       <b>app</b> is the application instance itself.

       Due  to  the  limited  load balancing algorithm used by gunicorn, it is not possible to use more than one
       worker process when using this web server. For that reason, all the  examples  above  include  the  <b>-w</b>  <b>1</b>
       option.

       The  workaround  to  use  multiple  worker  processes  with  gunicorn  is to launch several single-worker
       instances and put them behind a more capable load balancer such as <u>nginx</u>.

   <b>uWSGI</b> <b>Web</b> <b>Server</b>
       When using the uWSGI server in combination with gevent,  the  Socket.IO  server  can  take  advantage  of
       uWSGI’s native WebSocket support.

       A  complete  explanation  of  the configuration and usage of the uWSGI server is beyond the scope of this
       documentation. The uWSGI server is a fairly complex package that provides a large and  comprehensive  set
       of  options.  It  must  be  compiled  with  WebSocket  and  SSL support for the WebSocket transport to be
       available. As way of an introduction, the following  command  starts  a  uWSGI  server  for  the  example
       application app.py on port 5000:

          $ uwsgi --http :5000 --gevent 1000 --http-websockets --master --wsgi-file app.py --callable app

   <b>Using</b> <b>nginx</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>WebSocket</b> <b>Reverse</b> <b>Proxy</b>
       It  is  possible  to  use  nginx  as  a  front-end reverse proxy that passes requests to the application.
       However, only releases of nginx 1.4 and newer support proxying of the  WebSocket  protocol.  Below  is  a
       basic nginx configuration that proxies HTTP and WebSocket requests:

          server {
              listen 80;
              server_name _;

              location / {
                  include proxy_params;
                  proxy_pass <a href="http://127.0.0.1">http://127.0.0.1</a>:5000;
              }

              location /static/ {
                  alias &lt;path-to-your-application&gt;/static/;
                  expires 30d;
              }

              location /socket.io {
                  include proxy_params;
                  proxy_http_version 1.1;
                  proxy_buffering off;
                  proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                  proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
                  proxy_pass <a href="http://127.0.0.1">http://127.0.0.1</a>:5000/socket.io;
              }
          }

       The next example adds the support for load balancing multiple Socket.IO servers:

          upstream socketio_nodes {
              ip_hash;

              server 127.0.0.1:5000;
              server 127.0.0.1:5001;
              server 127.0.0.1:5002;
              # to scale the app, just add more nodes here!
          }

          server {
              listen 80;
              server_name _;

              location / {
                  include proxy_params;
                  proxy_pass <a href="http://127.0.0.1">http://127.0.0.1</a>:5000;
              }

              location /static/ {
                  alias &lt;path-to-your-application&gt;/static/;
                  expires 30d;
              }

              location /socket.io {
                  include proxy_params;
                  proxy_http_version 1.1;
                  proxy_buffering off;
                  proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                  proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
                  proxy_pass <a href="http://socketio_nodes/socket.io">http://socketio_nodes/socket.io</a>;
              }
          }

       While  the  above  examples  can  work as an initial configuration, be aware that a production install of
       nginx will need a more complete configuration covering other deployment aspects such as SSL support.

   <b>Using</b> <b>Multiple</b> <b>Workers</b>
       Flask-SocketIO supports multiple workers behind a load balancer  starting  with  release  2.0.  Deploying
       multiple  workers gives applications that use Flask-SocketIO the ability to spread the client connections
       among multiple processes and hosts, and in this way scale to support very  large  numbers  of  concurrent
       clients.

       There are two requirements to use multiple Flask-SocketIO workers:

       • The  load  balancer  must  be configured to forward all HTTP requests from a given client always to the
         same worker. This is sometimes referenced as "sticky sessions". For nginx, use the <b>ip_hash</b> directive to
         achieve this.  Gunicorn cannot be used with multiple workers because its load balancer  algorithm  does
         not support sticky sessions.

       • Since  each  of the servers owns only a subset of the client connections, a message queue such as Redis
         or RabbitMQ is used by the servers to coordinate complex operations such as broadcasting and rooms.

       When working with a message queue, there are additional dependencies that need to be installed:

       • For Redis, the package <b>redis</b> must be installed (<b>pip</b> <b>install</b> <b>redis</b>).

       • For RabbitMQ, the package <b>kombu</b> must be installed (<b>pip</b> <b>install</b> <b>kombu</b>).

       • For Kafka, the package <b>kafka-python</b> must be installed (<b>pip</b> <b>install</b> <b>kafka-python</b>).

       • For other message queues supported by Kombu, see the <u>Kombu</u> <u>documentation</u> to find out what  dependencies
         are needed.

       • If  eventlet  or gevent are used, then monkey patching the Python standard library is normally required
         to force the message queue package to use coroutine friendly functions and classes.

       For eventlet, monkey patching is done with:

          import eventlet
          eventlet.monkey_patch()

       For gevent, you can monkey patch the standard library with:

          from gevent import monkey
          monkey.patch_all()

       In both cases it is recommended that you apply the monkey patching at the top of your main  script,  even
       above your imports.

       To  start  multiple  Flask-SocketIO  servers,  you  must  first ensure you have the message queue service
       running. To start a Socket.IO server and have it connect to the  message  queue,  add  the  <b>message_queue</b>
       argument to the <b>SocketIO</b> constructor:

          socketio = SocketIO(app, message_queue='redis://')

       The  value  of  the <b>message_queue</b> argument is the connection URL of the queue service that is used. For a
       redis queue running on the same host as the server, the <b>'redis://'</b> URL  can  be  used.  Likewise,  for  a
       default  RabbitMQ  queue the <b>'amqp://'</b> URL can be used. For Kafka, use a <b>kafka://</b> URL.  The Kombu package
       has a <u>documentation</u> <u>section</u> that describes the format of the URLs for all the supported queues.

   <b>Emitting</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>External</b> <b>Process</b>
       For many types of applications, it is necessary to emit events from a process that is  not  the  SocketIO
       server,  for  an example a Celery worker. If the SocketIO server or servers are configured to listen on a
       message queue as shown in the previous section, then any  other  process  can  create  its  own  <b>SocketIO</b>
       instance and use it to emit events in the same way the server does.

       For  example,  for an application that runs on an eventlet web server and uses a Redis message queue, the
       following Python script broadcasts an event to all clients:

          socketio = SocketIO(message_queue='redis://')
          socketio.emit('my event', {'data': 'foo'}, namespace='/test')

       When using the <b>SocketIO</b> instance in this way, the  Flask  application  instance  is  not  passed  to  the
       constructor.

       The  <b>channel</b>  argument  to <b>SocketIO</b> can be used to select a specific channel of communication through the
       message queue. Using a custom channel name is necessary when  there  are  multiple  independent  SocketIO
       services sharing the same queue.

       Flask-SocketIO  does  not apply monkey patching when eventlet or gevent are used. But when working with a
       message queue, it is very likely that the Python package that talks to the  message  queue  service  will
       hang if the Python standard library is not monkey patched.

       It is important to note that an external process that wants to connect to a SocketIO server does not need
       to  use  eventlet  or  gevent  like  the main server. Having a server use a coroutine framework, while an
       external process is not a problem. For example, Celery workers do  not  need  to  be  configured  to  use
       eventlet  or  gevent just because the main server does. But if your external process does use a coroutine
       framework for whatever reason, then monkey patching  is  likely  required,  so  that  the  message  queue
       accesses coroutine friendly functions and classes.

   <b>Cross-Origin</b> <b>Controls</b>
       For  security  reasons,  this  server  enforces a same-origin policy by default. In practical terms, this
       means the following:

       • If an incoming HTTP or WebSocket request includes the <b>Origin</b> header, this header must match the  scheme
         and  host  of the connection URL. In case of a mismatch, a 400 status code response is returned and the
         connection is rejected.

       • No restrictions are imposed on incoming requests that do not include the <b>Origin</b> header.

       If necessary, the <b>cors_allowed_origins</b> option can be used to allow other origins. This  argument  can  be
       set  to  a string to set a single allowed origin, or to a list to allow multiple origins. A special value
       of <b>'*'</b> can be used to instruct the server to allow all origins, but this should be  done  with  care,  as
       this could make the server vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

</pre><h4><b>UPGRADING</b> <b>TO</b> <b>FLASK-SOCKETIO</b> <b>5.X</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>THE</b> <b>4.X</b> <b>RELEASES</b></h4><pre>
       The  Socket.IO  protocol recently introduced a series of backwards incompatible changes. The 5.x releases
       of Flask-SocketIO adopted these changes, and for that reason it can only be used with clients  that  have
       also  been  updated to the current version of the protocol. In particular, this means that the JavaScript
       client must be upgraded to a 3.x release, and if your client hasn't been upgraded to the  latest  version
       of the Socket.IO protocol, then you must use a Flask-SocketIO 4.x release.

       The following protocol changes are of importance, as they may affect existing applications:

       • The default namespace <b>'/'</b> is not automatically connected anymore, and is now treated in the same way as
         other namespaces.

       • Each  namespace  connection  has  its  own  <b>sid</b> value, different from the others and different from the
         Engine.IO <b>sid</b>.

       • Flask-SocketIO now uses the  same  ping  interval  and  timeout  values  as  the  JavaScript  reference
         implementation, which are 25 and 5 seconds respectively.

       • The  ping/pong mechanism has been reversed. In the current version of the protocol, the server issues a
         ping and the client responds with a pong.

       • The default allowed payload size for long--polling packets has been lowered from 100MB to 1MB.

       • The <u>io</u> cookie is not sent to the client anymore by default.
