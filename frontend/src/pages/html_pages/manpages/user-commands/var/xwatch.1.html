</pre><h4><b>Chapter</b> <b>1:</b> <b>Introduction</b></h4><pre>
       XWatch  is  a  small program that I wrote to monitor logfiles and to see any changes <b>directly</b> (instead of
       having to read all the logs after a breakin or a crash).  XWatch  is  simply  started  with  a  few  file
       arguments,  and  any  information that appears on the files is displayed.  With a slider you can see past
       information; i.e., lines that scroll in xwatch’s window. That’s all there is to it. The appearance of the
       xwatch window can furthermore be modified via command line flags or via  an  application  defaults  file.
       (Older  versions  of  XWatch  had  a  button to activate an `options’ window. I removed this code, almost
       no-one uses it.)

       XWatch is incidentally my first applications with the XForms GUI  library  for  X,  which  I  can  highly
       recommend for developers who want to start `X programming’ but who don’t want to go through the hassle of
       having  to learn about intrinsics. XForms is really excellent. Congrats, T.C. Zhao and Mark Overmars (the
       latter is rumored to bootleg at a soccer club in his free time ;). Instructions on where and how  to  get
       the XForms library are in the Makefile, contained in xwatch’s distribution.

       <b>Debian</b>  <b>maintainer</b>  <b>note:</b>  XWatch  doesn’t  have an active upstream maintainer.  If you are interested in
       taking over this package, please see the file /usr/share/doc/xwatch/README.debian

</pre><h4><b>Chapter</b> <b>2:</b> <b>Using</b> <b>xwatch</b></h4><pre>
       You typically start xwatch when activating an X session; e.g., from the file which xdm uses to fire up  a
       user’s  session  (this file is normally /usr/X11/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession). The command that starts xwatch is
       something like

       xwatch [options] files &amp;

       where `options’ are optional flags, files are the files to watch, and the ampersand character is used  to
       start  xwatch in the background. The files to watch are typically in the directory /var/adm/: files which
       are created by the syslog daemon (see the file syslogd.conf.SAMPLE in the distribution for  an  example).
       XWatch accepts only filenames which are:

       startit()

       o      ordinary files, no sockets, directory names,

       o      which are not binary files.

       endit()

       Other  files  as  stated on the commandline are not monitored. When any `non-proper’ file is given on the
       commandline, xwatch warns about the file not being acceptable and deletes it from its list of names.

</pre><h4><b>2.1:</b> <b>Options</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>xwatch</b> <b>program</b></h4><pre>
       The options are many, start xwatch without arguments to see what is supported. All options  can  also  be
       stated  in  the  file  /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XWatch  as  X  resources  (see  the file XWatch.ap as an
       example). In the following enumeration, a <u>nr</u> denotes a number:

       startit()

       o      -border <u>nr</u>:  Specifies whether xwatch should start with a border. The <u>nr</u> must be 0 or 1. When  you
              start xwatch without a border, your window manager may not be able to resize or even recognize it.
              Incidentally,  this  may  be  what  you  want -- I use it to `hide’ the presence of xwatch from my
              window manager fvwm.

       o      -geometry <u>geom</u>: Specifies the display geometry,  a-la  other  X  programs.  You  can  express  the
              geometry  in terms of <u>WxH</u> (width by height), optionally postfixed by <u>+X+Y</u> (x and y offset) or <u>-X-Y</u>
              (offsets relative to the lower right corner) and other combinations.

       Note that previous switches that emulated the geometry specification, such as -xpos and -height, are  now
       obsolete. Use the geometry setting.

       o      -fg  <u>color</u>  and -bg <u>color</u>: These options define the default foreground and background of the watch
              window.

       Note that previous switches, such as -bred and -bblue, are now obsolete.

       o      -printtime <u>nr</u>: Defines whether xwatch  should  prefix  any  info  on  the  watched  files  with  a
              timestamp. The nr can be 0 or zero; the timestamp is printed when <u>nr</u> is 1.

       o      -printname  <u>nr</u>:  Defines  whether  xwatch  should  prefix  any  info on the watched files with the
              filename. The <u>nr</u> is again a flag, 0 or 1.

       o      -newline <u>nr</u>: Defines whether xwatch should let a newline follow the time and/or filename stamp, so
              that the actual information is displayed on its own line.

       o      -interval <u>nr</u>: Defines  the  scanning  interval.   Each  <u>nr</u>  seconds,  xwatch  will  check  if  new
              information has arrived on the watched files. The <u>nr</u> may be between 1 and 30 seconds.

       o      -fontsize <u>nr</u>: Defines the initial size of the display font.  The <u>nr</u> may range from 1 to 4; 1 being
              the smallest font and 4 being the largest.

       o      -fontstyle  <u>nr</u>:  Defines  the style of the used font. The <u>nr</u> is a number between 0 and 15 (0 being
              the default). Start xwatch without arguments or read the application defaults  file  to  see  what
              fonts the numbers choose.

       o      -firstwarnings  <u>nr</u>:  Defines  whether  xwatch should print initial warnings into the watch window.
              E.g., you might like to set firstwarnings to zero, and then start xwatch with  the  file  argument
              /var/adm/*.  Warnings about, e.g., utmp being a binary file would then be suppressed.

       o      -printversion  <u>nr</u>:  Controls  whether  xwatch  prints its version number and copyright notice upon
              startup in the watch window.

       o      -gag <u>text</u>: This option, when present, prevents all lines with <u>text</u> in them from being shown in the
              display window. You can specify more than one string to `gag’, in that case, separate the  strings
              with |.

       o      -colorstring  <u>col:string</u>:  This  option causes lines that contain string to be displayed using the
              specified color.  The string is matched literally.  E.g.,  if  you  use  the  option  -colorstring
              blue:connection then all lines containing connection are displayed in pure blue.

       You  can  specify  several  colorstrings by separating all options with a | character, as in -colorstring
       blue:connection|red:error. Note that, for reasons of shell expansion, you should quote  such  options  on
       the commandline.

       o      -title  <u>name</u>: This option sets the window title of the watch window. Note that the title will only
              be visible when border is not 0. This option may be useful if you  have  several  XWatch  windows,
              monitoring different things.

       o      -ignore  <u>fileA|fileB|fileC|...</u>:  This  option  is  handy  if you start XWatch with a wildcard file
              argument, but when you want XWatch <b>not</b> to process some files. The -ignore flag removes the  stated
              files  from  the  watchlist. Note that, for reasons of shell commandline expansion, you must quote
              the file specification (or the shell will interpret the | characters  as  pipes).  (Thanks,  Frank
              Brokken, <a href="mailto:frank@icce.rug.nl">frank@icce.rug.nl</a> for the code).

       <b>Debian</b>  <b>Maintainer’s</b>  <b>note:</b>  <b>Applications</b>  <b>defaults</b>  <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> <b>/etc/X11/app-defaults/XWatch</b> <b>.</b>  <b>System</b>
       <b>adminitrators</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>customize</b> <b>xwatch</b> <b>globally</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>file</b> <b>/etc/X11/Xresources/xwatch</b> <b>for</b>
       <b>these</b> <b>configurations</b> <b>by</b> <b>prefixing</b> <b>the</b> <b>entries</b> <b>with</b> <b>Xwatch</b>  <b>(see</b>  <b>/usr/share/doc/xwatch/README.Debian</b>  <b>for</b>
       <b>an</b>  <b>example).</b>  <b>Individual</b> <b>users</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b><a href="file:~/.Xdefaults">~/.Xdefaults</a></b> <b>or</b> <b><a href="file:~/.Xresources">~/.Xresources</a></b>
       <b>files.</b>

       Before    you    extensively    use    the    options,    create    an    application    defaults    file
       /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XWatch.  You  can  do  so  by  copying  the  file XWatch.ap, extracted from the
       archive, to /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XWatch. The comments in the distributed application  defaults  file
       explain what you can configure and show examples.

       Some  systems  do  not have the directory /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  In that case, you should create the
       following links:

       startit()

       o      /usr/X11 should point to your X11 distribution; e.g.  to /usr/X11R6. That  way,  you  always  have
              e.g.   /usr/X11/bin,  even  after  upgrading  your X11 distribution. All that is needed is one new
              link.

       o      /usr/lib/X11 should point to /usr/X11/lib/X11.

       endit()

       Then edit the file XWatch in the application defaults directory, and follow the instructions  therein  to
       define  your  favorite  settings.   If  you need to start xwatch incidentally with another setting, use a
       flag.

</pre><h4><b>2.2:</b> <b>File</b> <b>arguments</b></h4><pre>
       The filename arguments can optionally be followed by a color specification  that  applies  only  to  that
       particular  file. E.g., say you want to see all the files in /var/adm normally in blue text; but you want
       to  see  /var/adm/critical  (critical  messages  from   applications)   in   yellow   and   /var/adm/auth
       (authentification messages) in red. In that case, the course to follow would be:

       startit()

       o      The  default foreground color would be blue. You could set this with the flags -fg blue, or in the
              application defaults file.

       o      The color for /var/adm/critical should be  yellow.   Hence,  the  first  file  argument  would  be
              /var/adm/critical:yellow.

       o      The  color  for  file  /var/adm/auth  should  be  red,  hence  the  second  file argument would be
              /var/adm/auth:red.

       o      The following arguments would be the files, using  the  standard  foreground  (blue):  /var/adm/*,
              without any extra color specifications.

       endit()

       Such  a commandline would cause xwatch to complain about the multiple presence of /var/adm/critical (once
       from the separate argument, and once from the wildcard argument) and similarly  about  /var/adm/auth.  If
       this  bothers  you,  turn  off  the  initial warnings (e.g., using -firstwarnings 0 or in the application
       defaults file).

       Note that besides the color specifications for filenames, you can also specify coloring  for  lines  that
       match  a  given  string  in  all  files.   See the above description of the  switch -colorstring for more
       information.

</pre><h4><b>Chapter</b> <b>3:</b> <b>Obtaining</b> <b>xwatch</b></h4><pre>
       XWatch can be obtained at the  ftp  site  ftp.icce.rug.nl,  in  the  directory  /pub/unix,  as  the  file
       xwatch-X.YY.tar.gz.  X.YY is the version number, e.g., 1.00. This site is the primary site, so check here
       for new versions.

       To unpack the archive, change-dir to your `sources’ directory (e.g., <a href="file:/usr/local/src">/usr/local/src</a>) and type

       tar xvzf /where/ever/you/put/it/xwatch-X.YY.tar.gz

       Next,  change-dir  to the unpacked subdirectory xwatch and check there.  You will find a subdirectory src
       with the full sources.

</pre><h4><b>Chapter</b> <b>4:</b> <b>Compiling</b> <b>xwatch</b></h4><pre>
       Follow these steps.

       startit()

       o      You will need the XForms library and include files to compile xwatch.  Check the Makefile  in  the
              src subdirectory for two ftp sites that carry XForms for Linux. Obtain the library and install it.
              XWatch will happily run with XForms version 0.81 or 0.88.

       o      In  the  src  subdirectory,  edit  the  Makefile  and adjust some defines at the top. E.g., a make
              install copies the binary by default to /usr/local/X11/bin; adjust that if  you  don’t  like  this
              behavior.

       o      Next, do a make install, followed by a make clean.

       o      Copy  the  file  XWatch.ap from the source directory to /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XWatch. Edit the
              file and state your favorite settings.

       o      Next, start the program xwatch with some file arguments in  your  logfiles  directory.  If  you’re
              satisfied  with  the  appearance  and  workings  of xwatch, add the invocation to your script that
              starts an X session.

       endit()
