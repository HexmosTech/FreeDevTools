       trial - run unit tests

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>trial</b> [ <u>options</u> ] [ <u>file</u> | <u>package</u> | <u>module</u> | <u>TestCase</u> | <u>testmethod</u> ] ...

       <b>trial</b> <b>--help</b> | <b>-h</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       trial  loads  and executes a suite of unit tests, obtained from modules, packages and files listed on the
       command line.

       trial  will  take  either  filenames  or  fully  qualified  Python  names  as  arguments.   Thus   `trial
       myproject/foo.py', `trial myproject.foo' and `trial myproject.foo.SomeTestCase.test_method' are all valid
       ways to invoke trial. Multiple such arguments are also accepted, and their order will determine the order
       in which the corresponding tests are run.

       After  running  the  given  test  suite, the default test reporter prints a summary of the test run. This
       consists of the word "PASSED"  (if  all  tests  ran  as  expected)  or  "FAILED"  (if  any  test  behaved
       unexpectedly)  followed by a count of the different kinds of test results encountered. The possible kinds
       of test results includes:

       successes
              Tests that passed all their assertions and completed without error.  These are marked "PASSED"  in
              the normal test output.

       failures
              Tests  that failed an assertion, called self.fail() or explicitly raised self.failureException for
              some reason. These are marked "FAILED" in the normal test output.

       errors Tests that raised an unexpected  exception  (including  AssertionError),  tests  that  caused  the
              tearDown()  method  to  raise  an  exception, tests that run for longer than the timeout interval,
              tests  that  caused  something  to  call  twisted.python.log.err()  without  subsequently  calling
              self.flushLoggedErrors(),  tests that leave the reactor in an unclean state, etc. These are marked
              "ERROR" in the normal test output.

              Note that because errors can be caused after the actual test method returns, it is possible for  a
              single  test  to  be  reported  as both an error and a failure, and hence the total number of test
              results can be greater than the total number of tests executed.

       skips  Tests that were skipped, usually because of missing dependencies. These are  marked  "SKIPPED"  in
              the normal test output.

       expectedFailures
              Tests  that  failed,  but  were  expected  to fail, usually because the test is for a feature that
              hasn't been implemented yet. These are marked "TODO" in the normal test output.

       unexpectedSuccesses
              Tests that should have been listed under expectedFailures, except that for some  reason  the  test
              succeeded. These are marked "SUCCESS!?!" in the normal test output.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-j</b>, <b>--jobs</b> <u>number</u>
              Set  the  number  of  process  workers  to run. It conflicts with the debug, exitfirst and profile
              options.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--debug</b>
              Run the tests in a debugger. If that debugger is 'pdb' (which is the default  if  unspecified),  a
              `.pdbrc'  will  be loaded from the current directory if it exists. Also does post-mortem debugging
              on exceptions.

       <b>-B</b>, <b>--debug-stacktraces</b>
              Report Deferred creation and callback stack traces.

       <b>--coverage</b>
              Generate coverage  information  in  the  `coverage'  subdirectory  of  the  trial  temp  directory
              (`_trial_temp'  by default). For each Python module touched by the execution of the given tests, a
              file will be created in the coverage directory named for the module's  fully-qualified  name  with
              the  suffix  `.cover'.   For  example,  because  the  trial  test runner is written in Python, the
              coverage directory will almost always contain a file named `twisted.trial.runner.cover'.

              Each `.cover' file contains a copy of the Python source of the module in question, with  a  prefix
              at  the beginning of each line containing coverage information.  For lines that are not executable
              (blank lines, comments, etc.)  the prefix is blank.  For executable lines that  were  run  in  the
              course  of  the  test  suite,  the prefix is a number indicating the number of times that line was
              executed.  The string `&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;' prefixes executable lines that were not executed in the  course  of
              the test suite.

              Note   that  this  functionality  uses  Python's  sys.settrace()  function,  so  tests  that  call
              sys.settrace() themselves are likely to break trial's coverage functionality.

       <b>--debugger</b>
              Specifies the debugger to use when the --debug option is passed. The argument should be the  fully
              qualified name of an object that implements the same interface as the standard library's `pdb'.

       <b>--disablegc</b>
              Disable  the  garbage collector for the duration of the test run. As each test is run, trial saves
              the TestResult objects, which means that Python's garbage collector has more  non-garbage  objects
              to  wade through, making each garbage-collection run slightly slower. Disabling garbage collection
              entirely will make some test suites complete faster (contrast --force-gc, below), at the  cost  of
              increasing  (possibly  greatly)  memory  consumption.  This  option also makes tests slightly more
              deterministic, which might help debugging in extreme circumstances.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--rterrors</b>
              Print tracebacks to standard output as soon as they occur.

       <b>--force-gc</b>
              Run gc.collect() before and after each test case. This can be used to isolate  errors  that  occur
              when objects get collected.  This option would be the default, except it makes tests run about ten
              times slower.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print a usage message to standard output, then exit.

       <b>--help-order</b>
              Print  a  list  of possible orders that TestCase test methods can be run in, then exit. The orders
              can be used with the --order option described below.

       <b>--help-reporters</b>
              Print a list of valid reporters to standard output, then exit. Reporters can be selected with  the
              --reporter option described below.

       <b>--help-reactors</b>
              Print  a  list  of  possible  reactors  to standard output, then exit. Not all listed reactors are
              available on every platform. Reactors can be selected with the --reactor option described below.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--logfile</b> <u>logfile</u>
              Direct the log to a different file. The default  file  is  `test.log'.   <u>logfile</u>  is  relative  to
              _trial_temp.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--dry-run</b>
              Go through all the tests and make them pass without running.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--no-recurse</b>
              By default, trial recurses through packages to find every module inside every subpackage.  Unless,
              that is, you specify this option.

       <b>--nopm</b> Don't  automatically  jump  into  debugger for post-mortem analysis of exceptions.  Only usable in
              conjunction with --debug.

       <b>--order</b> <u>order</u>
              Specify what order to run the individual test methods within the given TestCases. By default, they
              are run alphabetically. See --help-order for a list of other valid values.

       <b>--profile</b>
              Run tests under the Python profiler.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--reactor</b> <u>reactor</u>
              Choose which reactor to use.  See --help-reactors for a list.

       <b>--recursionlimit</b> <u>limit</u>
              Set Python's recursion limit. See sys.setrecursionlimit().

       <b>--reporter</b> <u>reporter</u>
              Select the reporter to use for trial's output.  Use the --help-reporters option to see a  list  of
              valid reporters.

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--exitfirst</b>
              Stop  the test run after the first test which does not succeed. This includes failures, errors, or
              unexpected successes. Won't work with the --jobs option currently.

       <b>--spew</b> Print an insanely verbose log of everything that happens. Useful when debugging freezes  or  locks
              in complex code.

       <b>--tbformat</b> <u>format</u>
              Format to display tracebacks with. Acceptable values are `default', `brief' and `verbose'. `brief'
              produces tracebacks that play nicely with Emacs' GUD.

       <b>--temp-directory</b> <u>directory</u>
              WARNING:  Do  not use this option unless you know what you are doing.  By default, trial creates a
              directory called _trial_temp under the current working  directory.   When  trial  runs,  it  first
              <u>deletes</u> this directory, then creates it, then changes into the directory to run the tests. The log
              file  and  any  coverage files are stored here. Use this option if you wish to have trial run in a
              directory other than _trial_temp. Be warned, trial will <u>delete</u> the  directory  before  re-creating
              it.

       <b>--testmodule</b> <u>filename</u>
              Ask  trial to look into <u>filename</u> and run any tests specified using the Emacs-style buffer variable
              `test-case-name'.

       <b>--unclean-warnings</b>
              As of Twisted 8.0, trial will report an error if the reactor is left unclean at  the  end  of  the
              test.  This  option  is provided to assist in migrating from Twisted 2.5 to Twisted 8.0 and later.
              Enabling this option will turn the errors into warnings.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--until-failure</b>
              Keep looping the tests until one of them raises an error  or  a  failure.   This  is  particularly
              useful for reproducing intermittent failures.

       <b>--version</b>
              Prints the Twisted version number and exit.

       <b>--without-module</b> <u>modulenames</u>
              Simulate  the  lack  of the specified comma-separated list of modules. This makes it look like the
              modules are not present in the system, causing tests to check the behavior for that configuration.

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--random</b> <u>seed</u>
              Run the tests in random order using the specified seed. Don't pass this option  if  you  also  are
              passing --order.
