   <b>COMMAND:</b>
              Atropos

              A  finite  mixture  modeling  (FMM)  segmentation approach with possibilities for specifying prior
              constraints. These prior constraints include the specification  of  a  prior  label  image,  prior
              probability  images  (one for each class), and/or an MRF prior to enforce spatial smoothing of the
              labels. All segmentation images including priors and masks must be in the same voxel and  physical
              space.  Similar algorithms include FAST and SPM. Reference: Avants BB, Tustison NJ, Wu J, Cook PA,

              data. Neuroinformatics. 2011 Dec;<a href="../man4/9.4.html">9</a>(4):381-400.

   <b>OPTIONS:</b>

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--image-dimensionality</b> 2/3/4

              This  option  forces  the  image to be treated as a specified-dimensional image. If not specified,
              Atropos tries to infer the dimensionality from the first input image.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--intensity-image</b> [intensityImage,&lt;adaptiveSmoothingWeight&gt;]

              One or more scalar images is specified for segmentation using the <b>-a</b>/--intensity-image option. For
              segmentation scenarios with no prior information,  the  first  scalar  image  encountered  on  the
              command  line is used to order labelings such that the class with the smallest intensity signature
              is class '1' through class 'N' which represents the voxels with the largest intensity values.  The
              optional  adaptive  smoothing  weight  parameter  is  applicable  only  when  using prior label or
              probability images. This scalar parameter is to be specified  between  [0,1]  which  smooths  each
              labeled  region separately and modulates the intensity measurement at each voxel in each intensity
              image between the original intensity and its smoothed counterpart. The smoothness  parameters  are
              governed by the <b>-b</b>/--bspline option.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--bspline</b> [&lt;numberOfLevels=6&gt;,&lt;initialMeshResolution=1x1x...&gt;,&lt;splineOrder=3&gt;]

              If  the  adaptive  smoothing weights are &gt; 0, the intensity images are smoothed in calculating the
              likelihood values. This is to account for subtle intensity  differences  across  the  same  tissue
              regions.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--initialization</b> Random[numberOfClasses]
              Otsu[numberOfTissueClasses]  KMeans[numberOfTissueClasses,&lt;clusterCenters(in  ascending  order and
              for                 first                 intensity                 image                  only)&gt;]
              PriorProbabilityImages[numberOfTissueClasses,fileSeriesFormat(index=1   to   numberOfClasses)   or
              vectorImage,priorWeighting,&lt;priorProbabilityThreshold&gt;]
              PriorLabelImage[numberOfTissueClasses,labelImage,priorWeighting]

              To initialize the FMM parameters, one of the following options must be specified. If one does  not
              have  prior  label  or probability images we recommend using kmeans as it is typically faster than
              otsu and can be used with multivariate initialization. However, since a Euclidean distance on  the
              inter  cluster  distances  is  used,  one  might  have to appropriately scale the additional input
              images. Random initialization is meant purely for intellectual  curiosity.   The  prior  weighting
              (specified  in the range [0,1]) is used to modulate the calculation of the posterior probabilities
              between the likelihood*mrfprior and  the  likelihood*mrfprior*prior.  For  specifying  many  prior
              probability images for a multi-label segmentation, we offer a minimize usage option (see <b>-m</b>). With
              that  option  one  can  specify a prior probability threshold in which only those pixels exceeding
              that threshold are stored in memory.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--partial-volume-label-set</b> label1xlabel2xlabel3

              The partial volume estimation option allows one to modelmixtures of classes within single  voxels.
              Atropos  currently  allows the user to model two class mixtures per partial volume class. The user
              specifies a set of class labels per partial volume class requested. For example, suppose the  user
              was  performing a classic 3-tissue segmentation (csf, gm, wm) using kmeans initialization. Suppose
              the user also wanted to model the partial voluming effects between  csf/gm  and  gm/wm.  The  user
              would  specify  it  using  <b>-i</b>  kmeans[3] and <b>-s</b> 1x2 <b>-s</b> 2x3. So, for this example, there would be 3
              tissue classes and 2 partial  volume  classes.   Optionally,the  user  can  limit  partial  volume
              handling to mrf considerations only whereby the output would only be the three tissues.

       <b>--use-partial-volume-likelihoods</b> 1/(0)
              true/(false)

              The  user  can  specify  whether  or  not to use the partial volume likelihoods, in which case the
              partial volume class is considered separate from the tissue classes. Alternatively,  one  can  use
              the  MRF  only to handle partial volume in which case, partial volume voxels are not considered as
              separate classes.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--posterior-formulation</b>
       Socrates[&lt;useMixtureModelProportions=1&gt;,&lt;initialAnnealingTemperature=1&gt;,&lt;annealingRate=1&gt;,&lt;minimumTemperature=0.1&gt;]
              Plato[&lt;useMixtureModelProportions=1&gt;,&lt;initialAnnealingTemperature=1&gt;,&lt;annealingRate=1&gt;,&lt;minimumTemperature=0.1&gt;]
              Aristotle[&lt;useMixtureModelProportions=1&gt;,&lt;initialAnnealingTemperature=1&gt;,&lt;annealingRate=1&gt;,&lt;minimumTemperature=0.1&gt;]
              Sigmoid[&lt;useMixtureModelProportions=1&gt;,&lt;initialAnnealingTemperature=1&gt;,&lt;annealingRate=1&gt;,&lt;minimumTemperature=0.1&gt;]]

              Different posterior probability formulations are possible as  are  different  update  options.  To
              guarantee  theoretical  convergence  properties,  a  proper formulation of the well-known iterated
              conditional modes (ICM) uses an asynchronous  update  step  modulated  by  a  specified  annealing
              temperature.  If  one sets the AnnealingTemperature &gt; 1 in the posterior formulation a traditional
              code set for a proper ICM update will be created. Otherwise, a synchronous update step  will  take
              place  at  each  iteration.  The  annealing  temperature,  T, converts the posteriorProbability to
              posteriorProbability^(1/T) over  the  course  of  optimization.  Options  include  the  following:
              Socrates: posteriorProbability = (spatialPrior)^priorWeight*(likelihood*mrfPrior)^(1-priorWeight),
              Plato:   posteriorProbability   =   1.0,   Aristotle:   posteriorProbability   =   1.0,   Sigmoid:
              posteriorProbability = 1.0,

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--mask-image</b> maskImageFilename

              The image mask (which is required) defines the region which  is  to  be  labeled  by  the  Atropos
              algorithm.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--convergence</b> numberOfIterations
              [&lt;numberOfIterations=5&gt;,&lt;convergenceThreshold=0.001&gt;]

              Convergence is determined by calculating the mean maximum posterior probability over the region of
              interest  at  each  iteration.  When  this  value  decreases  or increases less than the specified
              threshold from the previous iteration or the maximum number of iterations is exceeded the  program
              terminates.

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--likelihood-model</b> Gaussian
              HistogramParzenWindows[&lt;sigma=1.0&gt;,&lt;numberOfBins=32&gt;]
              ManifoldParzenWindows[&lt;pointSetSigma=1.0&gt;,&lt;evaluationKNeighborhood=50&gt;,&lt;CovarianceKNeighborhood=0&gt;,&lt;kernelSigma=0&gt;]
              JointShapeAndOrientationProbability[&lt;shapeSigma=1.0&gt;,&lt;numberOfShapeBins=64&gt;,
              &lt;orientationSigma=1.0&gt;, &lt;numberOfOrientationBins=32&gt;] LogEuclideanGaussian

              Both  parametric  and  non-parametric  options exist in Atropos. The Gaussian parametric option is
              commonly used (e.g. SPM &amp; FAST) where the mean and standard deviation for  the  Gaussian  of  each
              class  is  calculated at each iteration. Other groups use non-parametric approaches exemplified by
              option 2. We recommend using options 1 or 2 as they are fairly standard and the default parameters
              work adequately.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--mrf</b> [&lt;smoothingFactor=0.3&gt;,&lt;radius=1x1x...&gt;]

              [&lt;mrfCoefficientImage&gt;,&lt;radius=1x1x...&gt;]

              Markov random field (MRF) theory provides a general framework for enforcing  spatially  contextual
              constraints  on the segmentation solution. The default smoothing factor of 0.3 provides a moderate
              amount of smoothing. Increasing this number causes more smoothing whereas  decreasing  the  number
              lessens  the  smoothing.  The  radius  parameter  specifies the mrf neighborhood. Different update
              schemes are possible but only the asynchronous updating has theoretical convergence properties.

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--icm</b> [&lt;useAsynchronousUpdate=1&gt;,&lt;maximumNumberOfICMIterations=1&gt;,&lt;icmCodeImage=''&gt;]

              Asynchronous updating requires the construction of an ICM code image which is a label image  (with
              labels in the range {1,..,MaximumICMCode}) constructed such that no MRF neighborhood has duplicate
              ICM  code  labels.  Thus, to update the voxel class labels we iterate through the code labels and,
              for each code label, we iterate through the image and update the voxel class label  that  has  the
              corresponding ICM code label. One can print out the ICM code image by specifying an ITK-compatible
              image filename.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--use-random-seed</b> 0/(1)

              Initialize  internal  random  number  generator  with  a random seed. Otherwise, initialize with a
              constant seed number.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--output</b> [classifiedImage,&lt;posteriorProbabilityImageFileNameFormat&gt;]

              The output consists of a labeled image where each voxel in the masked region is assigned  a  label
              from  1,  2, ..., N. Optionally, one can also output the posterior probability images specified in
              the same format as the prior probability images,  e.g.  posterior%02d.nii.gz  (C-style  file  name
              formatting).

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--minimize-memory-usage</b> (0)/1

              By default, memory usage is not minimized, however, if this is needed, the various probability and
              distance  images  are  calculated  on the fly instead of being stored in memory at each iteration.
              Also, if prior probability images are used, only the non-negligible pixel  values  are  stored  in
              memory.  &lt;VALUES&gt;: 0

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--winsorize-outliers</b> BoxPlot[&lt;lowerPercentile=0.25&gt;,&lt;upperPercentile=0.75&gt;,&lt;whiskerLength=1.5&gt;]
              GrubbsRosner[&lt;significanceLevel=0.05&gt;,&lt;winsorizingLevel=0.10&gt;]

              To  remove  the  effects of outliers in calculating the weighted mean and weighted covariance, the
              user can opt to remove the outliers through the options specified below.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--use-euclidean-distance</b> (0)/1

              Given prior label or probability images, the labels are propagated throughout the masked region so
              that every voxel in the mask is labeled. Propagation is done by using a signed distance  transform
              of  the label. Alternatively, propagation of the labels with the fast marching filter respects the
              distance along the shape of the mask (e.g. the sinuous sulci and gyri of the cortex).  &lt;VALUES&gt;: 0

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--label-propagation</b> whichLabel[lambda=0.0,&lt;boundaryProbability=1.0&gt;]

              The propagation of each prior label can be controlled  by  the  lambda  and  boundary  probability
              parameters.  The  latter  parameter  is  the  probability (in the range [0,1]) of the label on the
              boundary which increases linearly to a maximum value of 1.0 in the interior of the labeled region.
              The former parameter dictates the exponential decay of probability propagation outside the labeled
              region from the boundary probability, i.e. boundaryProbability*exp( <b>-lambda</b> * distance ).

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b> (0)/1

              Verbose output.
