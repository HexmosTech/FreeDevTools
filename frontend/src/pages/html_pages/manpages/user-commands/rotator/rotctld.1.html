</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       rotctld - TCP rotator control daemon

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rotctld</b> [<b>-hlLuV</b>] [<b>-m</b> <u>id</u>] [<b>-r</b> <u>device</u>] [<b>-s</b> <u>baud</u>] [<b>-T</b> <u>IPADDR</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>number</u>] [<b>-C</b> <u>parm=val</u>] [<b>-v</b>[<b>-Z</b>]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>rotctld</b>  program  is  a  rotator  control daemon that handles client requests via TCP sockets.  This
       allows multiple user programs to share one rotator (this needs more development).  Multiple rotators  can
       be  controlled  on  different TCP ports by use of multiple <b>rotctld</b> processes.  The syntax of the commands
       are the same as <b><a href="../man1/rotctl.1.html">rotctl</a></b>(1).  It is hoped that <b>rotctld</b> will be especially useful for client  authors  using
       languages such as Perl, Python, PHP, and others.

       <b>rotctld</b>  communicates  to  a  client  through  a  TCP socket using text commands shared with <b>rotctl</b>.  The
       protocol is simple, commands are sent to <b>rotctld</b> on one line and <b>rotctld</b> responds to “get” commands  with
       the requested values, one per line, when successful, otherwise, it responds with one line “RPRT x”, where
       ‘x’  is a negative number indicating the error code.  Commands that do not return values respond with the
       line “RPRT x”, where ‘x’ is ‘0’ when successful, otherwise is a  regative  number  indicating  the  error
       code.   Each line is terminated with a newline ‘\n’ character.  This protocol is primarily for use by the
       <b>NET</b> <b>rotctl</b> (rotator model 2) backend.

       A separate <b>Extended</b> <b>Response</b> <b>Protocol</b> extends the above behavior by echoing the received  command  string
       as  a  header,  any  returned values as a key: value pair, and the “RPRT x” string as the end of response
       marker which includes the <b>Hamlib</b> success or  failure  value.   See  the  <b>PROTOCOL</b>  section  for  details.
       Consider using this protocol for clients that will interact with <b>rotctld</b> directly through a TCP socket.

       Keep  in mind that Hamlib is BETA level software.  While a lot of backend libraries lack complete rotator
       support, the basic functions are usually well supported.

       Please report bugs and provide feedback at the e-mail address given in the <b>BUGS</b> section  below.   Patches
       and code enhancements sent to the same address are welcome.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax.  Short options that take an argument may have the
       value follow immediately or be separated by a space.  Long options starting with two dashes (‘-’) require
       an ‘=’ between the option and any argument.

       Here is a summary of the supported options:

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--model</b>=<u>id</u>
              Select rotator model number.

              See model list (use “rotctld -l”).

              <b>Note</b>:  <b>rotctl</b>  (or  third  party software using the C API) will use rotator model 2 for <b>NET</b> <b>rotctl</b>
              (this model number is not used for rotctld even though it shows in the model list).

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--rot-file</b>=<u>device</u>
              Use <u>device</u> as the file name of the port connected to the rotator.

              Often a serial port, but could be a USB to  serial  adapter.   Typically  <u>/dev/ttyS0</u>,  <u>/dev/ttyS1</u>,
              <u>/dev/ttyUSB0</u>,  etc.  on  Linux, <u>COM1</u>, <u>COM2</u>, etc. on MS Windows.  The BSD flavors and Mac OS/X have
              their own designations.  See your system's documentation.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--serial-speed</b>=<u>baud</u>
              Set serial speed to <u>baud</u> rate.

              Uses maximum serial speed from rotator backend capabilities as the default.

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--listen-addr</b>=<u>IPADDR</u>
              Use <u>IPADDR</u> as the listening IP address.

              The default is ANY.

              <b>rotctld</b> can be run and connected to like this:

              rotctld (binds to all interfaces)
                  rotctl -m 2
                  rotctl -m 2 -r 127.0.0.1
                  rotctl -m 2 -r localhost
                  rotctl -m 2 -r 192.168.1.1 (local IP address)
                  rotctl -m 2 -r ::1 (on Linux rotctld doesn't listen on IPV6 by default)

              rotctld -T 127.0.0.1 (bind only to 127.0.0.1)
                  rotctl -m 2 (binds to all interfaces)
                  rotctl -m 2 -r 127.0.0.1 (bind only to 127.0.0.1)

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--port</b>=<u>number</u>
              Use
              <u>number</u>
              as the TCP listening port.

              The default is 4533.

              <b>Note</b>:
              As
              <b>rotctld</b>'s
              default port is 4533, it is advisable to use odd numbered ports for
              <b>rotctld</b>,
              e.g. 4533, 4535, 4537, etc.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--show-conf</b>
              List all configuration parameters for the rotator defined with
              <b>-m</b>
              above.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--set-conf</b>=<u>parm=val</u>[<u>,parm=val</u>]
              Set rotator configuration parameter(s),  e.g.
              <u>stop_bits=2</u>.

              Use the
              <b>-L</b>
              option above for a list of configuration parameters for a given model number.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--dump-state</b>
              Dump state for the rotator defined with
              <b>-m</b>
              above and exit.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--dump-caps</b>
              Dump capabilities for the rotator defined with
              <b>-m</b>
              above and exit.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--list</b>
              List all rotator model numbers defined in
              <b>Hamlib</b>
              and exit.

              The list is sorted by model number.

              <b>Note</b>:
              In Linux the list can be scrolled back using
              <b>Shift-PageUp</b>/<b>Shift-PageDown</b>,
              or using the scrollbars of a virtual terminal in X or the cmd window in
              Windows.  The output can be piped to
              <b><a href="../man1/more.1.html">more</a></b>(1)
              or
              <b><a href="../man1/less.1.html">less</a></b>(1),
              e.g. “rotctl -l | more”.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Set verbose mode, cumulative (see
              <b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
              below).

       <b>-Z</b>, <b>--debug-time-stamps</b>
              Enable time stamps for the debug messages.

              Use only in combination with the
              <b>-v</b>
              option as it generates no output on its own.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Show a summary of these options and exit.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Show version of
              <b>rotctld</b>
              and exit.

       <b>Note</b>:
       Some options may not be implemented by a given backend and will return an
       error.  This is most likely to occur with the
       <b>--set-conf</b>
       and
       <b>--show-conf</b>
       options.

       Be aware that the backend for the rotator to be controlled, or the rotator
       itself may not support some commands. In that case, the operation will fail
       with a
       <b>Hamlib</b>
       error code.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       Commands can be sent over the TCP socket either as a single char, or as a  long  command  name  plus  the
       value(s) space separated on one ‘\n’ terminated line. See <b>PROTOCOL</b>.

       Since  most  of  the <b>Hamlib</b> operations have a <b>set</b> and a <b>get</b> method, an upper case letter will be used for
       <b>set</b> methods whereas the corresponding lower case letter refers to the <b>get</b> method.   Each  operation  also
       has a long name; prepend a backslash, ‘\’, to send a long command name.

       Example  (Perl): “print $socket "\\dump_caps\n";” to see what the rotator's backend can do (<b>Note</b>: In Perl
       and many other languages a ‘\’ will need to be escaped with a preceding  ‘\’  so  that  even  though  two
       backslash  characters  appear  in  the code, only one will be passed to <b>rotctld</b>.  This is a possible bug,
       beware!).

       <b>Note</b>: The backend for the rotator to be controlled, or the rotator itself may not support some  commands.
       In that case, the operation will fail with a <b>Hamlib</b> error message.

       Here  is a summary of the supported commands (In the case of <b>set</b> commands the quoted italicized string is
       replaced by the value in the description.  In the case of <b>get</b> commands the quoted  italicized  string  is
       the key name of the value returned.):

       <b>P</b>, <b>set_pos</b> '<u>Azimuth</u>' '<u>Elevation</u>'
              Set position.

              '<u>Azimuth</u>' and '<u>Elevation</u>' are floating point values.

              For example (typed text shown in bold):

                  <b>P</b> <b>163.0</b> <b>41.0</b>

              <b>Note</b>:  If  the  rotator  does  not  support  setting  elevation  (most  do  not)  supply “0.0” for
              '<u>Elevation</u>'.

       <b>p</b>, <b>get_pos</b>
              Get position.

              '<u>Azimuth</u>' and '<u>Elevation</u>' are returned as double precision floating point values.

       <b>M</b>, <b>move</b> '<u>Direction</u>' '<u>Speed</u>'
              Move the rotator in a specific direction at the given rate.

              '<u>Direction</u>' is an integer or keyword defined as ‘2’ = UP, ‘4’ = DOWN, ‘8’ = LEFT or  CCW,  ‘16’  =
              RIGHT  or  CW,  ‘32’ = UP_LEFT or UP_CCW, ‘R64’ = UP_RIGHT = UP_CW, ‘128’ = DOWN_LEFT or DOWN_CCW,
              ‘256’ = DOWN_RIGHT or DOWN_CW

              '<u>Speed</u>' is an integer between 1 and 100. Use -1 for no change to current speed.

              <b>Note</b>: Not all backends that implement the move command use the Speed value.

       <b>S</b>, <b>stop</b>
              Stop the rotator.

       <b>K</b>, <b>park</b>
              Park the rotator.

       <b>C</b>, <b>set_conf</b> '<u>Token</u>' '<u>Value</u>'
              Set a configuration parameter.

              '<u>Token</u>' is a string; see the <b>-C</b> option and the <b>-L</b> output.

              '<u>Value</u>' is a string of up to 20 characters.

       <b>R</b>, <b>reset</b> '<u>Reset</u>'
              Reset the rotator.

              '<u>Reset</u>' accepts an integer value of ‘1’ for “Reset All”.

       <b>_</b>, <b>get_info</b>
              Get misc information about the rotator.

              Returns '<u>Info</u>' “Model Name”.

       <b>dump_state</b>
              Return certain state information about the rotator backend.

       <b>1</b>, <b>dump_caps</b>
              Not a real rot remote command, it just dumps capabilities, i.e. what the backend knows about  this
              model, and what it can do.

       <b>w</b>, <b>send_cmd</b> '<u>Cmd</u>'
              Send a raw command string to the rotator.

              ASCII  CR  is  appended  automatically  at  the end of the command for text protocols.  For binary
              protocols, enter hexadecimal values as “\0xAA\0xBB”.

   <b>Locator</b> <b>Commands</b>
       These commands offer conversions of Degrees Minutes Seconds to other formats, <b>Maidenhead</b>  square  locator
       conversions and distance and azimuth conversions.

       <b>L</b>, <b>lonlat2loc</b> '<u>Longitude</u>' '<u>Latitude</u>' '<u>Loc</u> <u>Len</u>'
              Returns the <b>Maidenhead</b> '<u>Locator</u>' for the given '<u>Longitude</u>' and '<u>Latitude</u>'.

              '<u>Longitude</u>' and '<u>Latitude</u>' are floating point values.

              '<u>Loc</u>  <u>Len</u>'  is  the  precision of the returned square and should be an even numbered integer value
              between 2 and 12.

              For example:

                  <b>L</b> <b>-170.0</b> <b>-85.0</b> <b>12</b>

              returns:

                  Locator: AA55AA00AA00

       <b>l</b>, <b>loc2lonlat</b> '<u>Locator</u>'
              Returns '<u>Longitude</u>' and '<u>Latitude</u>' in decimal degrees at the approximate center of  the  requested
              <b>Maidenhead</b> grid square.

              '<u>Locator</u>' can be from 2 to 12 characters in length.

              West longitude is expressed as a negative value.

              South latitude is expressed as a negative value.

              For example:

                  <b>l</b> <b>AA55AA00AA00</b>

              returns:

                  Longitude: -169.999983 Latitude: -84.999991

              <b>Note</b>: Despite the use of double precision variables internally, some rounding error occurs.

       <b>D</b>, <b>dms2dec</b> '<u>Degrees</u>' '<u>Minutes</u>' '<u>Seconds</u>' '<u>S/W</u>'
              Returns '<u>Dec</u> <u>Degrees</u>', a signed floating point value.

              '<u>Degrees</u>' and '<u>Minutes</u>' are integer values.

              '<u>Seconds</u>' is a floating point value.

              '<u>S/W</u>'  is  a  flag with ‘1’ indicating South latitude or West longitude and ‘0’ North or East (the
              flag is needed as computers don't recognize a signed zero even though only the '<u>Degrees</u>' value  is
              typically signed in DMS notation).

       <b>d</b>, <b>dec2dms</b> '<u>Dec</u> <u>Degrees</u>'
              Returns '<u>Degrees</u>' '<u>Minutes</u>' '<u>Seconds</u>' '<u>S/W</u>'.

              Values are as in <b>dms2dec</b> above.

       <b>E</b>, <b>dmmm2dec</b> '<u>Degrees</u>' '<u>Dec</u> <u>Minutes</u>' '<u>S/W</u>'
              Returns '<u>Dec</u> <u>Degrees</u>', a signed floating point value.

              '<u>Degrees</u>' is an integer value.

              '<u>Dec</u> <u>Minutes</u>' is a floating point value.

              '<u>S/W</u>' is a flag as in <b>dms2dec</b> above.

       <b>e</b>, <b>dec2dmmm</b> '<u>Dec</u> <u>Deg</u>'
              Returns '<u>Degrees</u>' '<u>Minutes</u>' '<u>S/W</u>'.

              Values are as in <b>dmmm2dec</b> above.

       <b>B</b>, <b>qrb</b> '<u>Lon</u> <u>1</u>' '<u>Lat</u> <u>1</u>' '<u>Lon</u> <u>2</u>' '<u>Lat</u> <u>2</u>'
              Returns '<u>Distance</u>' and '<u>Azimuth</u>'.

              '<u>Distance</u>' is in km.

              '<u>Azimuth</u>' is in degrees.

              Supplied <u>Lon</u>/<u>Lat</u> values are signed floating point numbers.

       <b>A</b>, <b>a_sp2a_lp</b> '<u>Short</u> <u>Path</u> <u>Deg</u>'
              Returns '<u>Long</u> <u>Path</u> <u>Deg</u>'.

              Both  the  supplied argument and returned value are floating point values within the range of 0.00
              to 360.00.

              <b>Note</b>: Supplying a negative value will return an error message.

       <b>a</b>, <b>d_sp2d_lp</b> '<u>Short</u> <u>Path</u> <u>km</u>'
              Returns '<u>Long</u> <u>Path</u> <u>km</u>'.

              Both the supplied argument and returned value are floating point values.

       <b>pause</b> '<u>Seconds</u>'
              Pause for the given whole (integer) number of '<u>Seconds</u>' before sending the  next  command  to  the
              rotator.

</pre><h4><b>PROTOCOL</b></h4><pre>
       There are two protocols in use by <b>rotctld</b>, the <b>Default</b> <b>Protocol</b> and the <b>Extended</b> <b>Response</b> <b>Protocol</b>.

       The  <b>Default</b>  <b>Protocol</b>  is  intended primarily for the communication between <b>Hamlib</b> library functions and
       <b>rotctld</b> (“NET rotctl”, available using rotator model ‘2’).

       The <b>Extended</b> <b>Response</b> <b>Protocol</b> is intended to be used with scripts or other programs interacting directly
       with <b>rotctld</b> as consistent feedback is provided.

   <b>Default</b> <b>Protocol</b>
       The <b>Default</b> <b>Protocol</b> is intentionally simple.  Commands are entered on a  single  line  with  any  needed
       values.   In  practice,  reliable  results are obtained by terminating each command string with a newline
       character, ‘\n’.

       Example set position (Perl code):

           <b>print</b> <b>$socket</b> <b>"P</b> <b>135</b> <b>10\n";</b>

       or:

           <b>print</b> <b>$socket</b> <b>"\\set_pos</b> <b>135</b> <b>10\n";</b>   # escape leading ‘\’

       A one line response will be sent as a reply to <b>set</b> commands, “RPRT <u>x</u>\n” where <u>x</u> is the Hamlib error  code
       with ‘0’ indicating success of the command.

       Responses  from  <b>rotctld</b> <b>get</b> commands are text values and match the same tokens used in the <b>set</b> commands.
       Each value is returned on its own line.  On error the string “RPRT <u>x</u>\n” is returned where <u>x</u> is the Hamlib
       error code.

       Example get position (Perl code):

           <b>print</b> <b>$socket</b> <b>"p\n";</b>
           "135"
           "10"

       Most <b>get</b> functions return one to three values. A notable exception is the <b>dump_caps</b> command which returns
       many lines of <b>key</b>:<u>value</u> pairs.

       This protocol is primarily used by the “NET rotctl” (rotctl model 2) backend  which  allows  applications
       already written for Hamlib's C API to take advantage of <b>rotctld</b> without the need of rewriting application
       code.   An  application's  user  can  select  rotator model 2 (“NET rotctl”) and then set <b>rot_pathname</b> to
       “localhost:4533” or other network <u>host</u>:<u>port</u> (set by the <b>-T</b>/<b>-t</b> options, respectively, above).

   <b>Extended</b> <b>Response</b> <b>Protocol</b>
       The Extended Response protocol adds several rules to the strings returned by <b>rotctld</b> and adds a rule  for
       the command syntax.

       1. The command received by <b>rotctld</b> is echoed with its long command name followed by the value(s) (if any)
       received  from  the  client  terminated  by  the  specified response separator as the first record of the
       response.

       2. The last record of each block is the string “RPRT <u>x</u>\n” where <u>x</u> is the  numeric  return  value  of  the
       Hamlib backend function that was called by the command.

       3.  Any  records  consisting  of  data  values  returned by the rotator backend are prepended by a string
       immediately followed by a colon then a space and then the value terminated  by  the  response  separator,
       e.g. “Azimuth: 90.000000\n” when the command was prepended by ‘+’.

       4.  All  commands received will be acknowledged by <b>rotctld</b> with records from rules 1 and 2.  Records from
       rule 3 are only returned when data values must be returned to the client.

       An example response to a <b>P</b> command sent from the shell prompt (note the prepended ‘+’):

           $ <b>echo</b> <b>"+P</b> <b>90</b> <b>45"</b> <b>|</b> <b>nc</b> <b>-w</b> <b>1</b> <b>localhost</b> <b>4533</b>
           set_pos: 90 45
           RPRT 0

       In this case the long command name and values are returned on the first line and the second line contains
       the end of block marker and the numeric rotor backend return value indicating success.

       An example response to a <b>get_pos</b> query:

          $ <b>echo</b> <b>"+\get_pos"</b> <b>|</b> <b>nc</b> <b>-w</b> <b>1</b> <b>localhost</b> <b>4533</b>
          get_pos:
          Azimuth: 90.000000
          Elevation: 45.000000
          RPRT 0

              <b>Note</b>: The ‘\’ is still required for the long command name even with the ERP character.

       In this case, as no value is passed to <b>rotctld</b>, the first line consists only of the  long  command  name.
       The final line shows that the command was processed successfully by the rotor backend.

       Invoking  the  Extended Response Protocol requires prepending a command with a punctuation character.  As
       shown in the examples above, prepending a ‘+’ character to the command results  in  the  responses  being
       separated  by  a newline character (‘\n’).  Any other punctuation character recognized by the C <b>ispunct</b>()
       function except ‘\’, ‘?’, or ‘_’ will cause that character to  become  the  response  separator  and  the
       entire response will be on one line.

       Separator character summary:

       ‘<b>+</b>’    Each record of the response is appended with a newline (‘\n’).

       ‘<b>;</b>’, ‘<b>|</b>’, or, ‘<b>,</b>’
              Each record of the response is appended by the given character resulting in entire response on one
              line.

              These are common record separators for text representations of spreadsheet data, etc.

       ‘<b>?</b>’    Reserved for help in <b>rotctl</b>.

       ‘<b>_</b>’    Reserved for <b>get_info</b> short command

       ‘<b>#</b>’    Reserved for comments when reading a command file script.

              <b>Note</b>: Other punctuation characters have not been tested!  Use at your own risk.

       For example, invoking a <b>get_pos</b> query with a leading ‘;’ returns:

           get_pos:;Azimuth: 90.000000;Elevation: 45.000000;RPRT 0

       Or, using the pipe character ‘|’ returns:

           get_pos:|Azimuth: 90.000000|Elevation: 45.000000|RPRT 0

       And a <b>set_pos</b> command prepended with a ‘|’ returns:

           set_pos: 135 22.5|RPRT 0

       Such  a  format  will  allow  reading  a response as a single event using a preferred response separator.
       Other punctuation characters have not been tested!

       All commands with the exception of <b>set_conf</b> have been tested with the Extended Response protocol and  the
       included <b>testrotctld.pl</b> Perl script.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b> option allows different levels of diagnostics to be output to <b>stderr</b> and correspond to
       -v for <b>BUG</b>, -vv for <b>ERR</b>, -vvv for <b>WARN</b>, -vvvv for <b>VERBOSE</b>, or -vvvvv for <b>TRACE</b>.

       A given verbose level is useful for providing needed debugging information to the  email  address  below.
       For  example,  TRACE  output  shows  all  of the values sent to and received from the radio which is very
       useful for radio backend library development and may be requested by the developers.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Start <b>rotctld</b> for a Hy-Gain Ham IV rotor with the Idiom Press RotorEZ board  installed  using  a  USB-to-
       serial adapter and backgrounding:

           $ <b>rotctld</b> <b>-m</b> <b>401</b> <b>-r</b> <b>/dev/ttyUSB1</b> <b>&amp;</b>

       Start <b>rotctld</b> for RotorEZ using COM2 on Win32:

           &gt; <b>rotctl</b> <b>-m</b> <b>401</b> <b>-r</b> <b>COM2</b>

       Connect  to  the  already  running  <b>rotctld</b>,  and  set position to 135.0 degrees azimuth and 30.0 degrees
       elevation with a 1 second read timeout from the shell prompt:

           $ <b>echo</b> <b>"\set_pos</b> <b>135.0</b> <b>30.0"</b> <b>|</b> <b>nc</b> <b>-w</b> <b>1</b> <b>localhost</b> <b>4533</b>

       Connect to a running <b>rotctld</b> with <b>rotctl</b> on the local host:

           $ <b>rotctl</b> <b>-m</b> <b>2</b>

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b></h4><pre>
       No authentication whatsoever; DO NOT leave this TCP port open  wide  to  the  Internet.   Please  ask  if
       stronger security is needed or consider using a Secure Shell (<b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1)) tunnel.

       As  <b>rotctld</b>  does  not  need any greater permissions than <b>rotctl</b>, it is advisable to not start <b>rotctld</b> as
       “root” or another system user account in order to limit any vulnerability.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The daemon is not detaching and backgrounding itself.

       No method to exit the daemon so the <b><a href="../man1/kill.1.html">kill</a></b>(1) command must be used to terminate it.

       Multiple clients using the daemon may experience contention with the connected rotator.
