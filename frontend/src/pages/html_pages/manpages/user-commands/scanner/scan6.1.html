</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>scan6</b>  is  an  IPv6  address  scanning  tool  that  implements a number of advanced IPv6 address scanning
       techniques. It is part of the SI6 Networks' IPv6 Toolkit:  a  security  assessment  suite  for  the  IPv6
       protocols.

       <b>HOST</b> <b>SCANNING</b> <b>TECHNIQUES</b>

       <b>scan6</b> employs a number of techniques to discover active IPv6 nodes. The following subsections discuss the
       different techniques employed for each type of IPv6 scan.

       <b>Local</b> <b>scans</b>

       For local scans, <b>scan6</b> operates (roughly) as follows:

           + The tool learns the local prefixes used for auto-configuration,
             and generates one address for each local prefix (in addition to
             a link-local address)

           + An ICMPv6 Echo Request message destined to the all-nodes on-link
             multicast address (ff02::1) is sent with each of the addresses
             "configured" in the previous step. Probe packets are sent with
             different Source Addresses, such that they elicit responses from
             different addresses (as a result of the default IPv6 Source
             Address selection policy). Hence. all (or most) addresses of
             each node can be discovered.

           + The same procedure of the previous bullet is performed, but
             this time with ICMPv6 packets that contain an unrecognized
             option of type 10xxxxxx, such that ICMPv6 Parameter Problem
             error messages are elicited. This allows the tool to discover
             e.g. Windows nodes, which otherwise do not respond to multicasted
             ICMPv6 Echo Request messages.

           + Each time a new "alive" address is discovered, the corresponding
             Interface-ID is combined with all the local prefixes, and the
             resulting addresses are probed (with unicasted packets). This
             can help to discover all the SLAAC-derived and the "private
             addresses", since some responses might contain e.g. Modified
             EUI-64 Format Identifiers, which are likely used with all the
             available prefixes.

           + Finally, the tool removes any duplicate addresses, such that each
             unique address is informed to the user only once.

       The  aforementioned  scheme can fail to discover some addresses for some implementation. For example, Mac
       OS X employs IPv6  addresses  embedding  IEEE-identifiers  when  responding  to  packets  destined  to  a
       link-local multicast address (and hence the temporary addresses could not be learned).

       <b>Remote</b> <b>scans</b>

       scan6 employs a number of bran-new techniques for performing address scans of remote networks. Namely, it
       tries  to  mitigate  a  number of patterns in IPv6 addresses, such that the (theoretical) search space of
       2**64 addresses is dramatically reduced. scan6 can leverage the following address patterns:

           + SLAAC addresses of specific vendors: Addresses that embedd the MAC
             address of the corresponding network interface card.

           + virtual host addresses: Most virtualization technologies select
             their MAC addresses from specific IEEE OUIs (e.g., VirtualBox
             employs the OUI 00:50:56)

           + "low-byte" addresses: in which only the lowest order (or the two
             lowest order) word of the IID contains a small integer (with the
             rest of the words being set to zero)

           + "port-based" addresses: in which one of the two low order 16 bit
             16-bit words of the IID encodes de service port number of the
             main service being hosted on the targer node.

           + IPv4-based addresses: in which the IID encodes the IPv4-address
             of the network interface (as in 2001:db8::192.168.1.1 or
             2001:db8::192:168:1:1)

       A     thorough     discussion     of     these     address     patterns     can     be     found      in:
       &lt;<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-opsec-ipv6-host-scanning">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-opsec-ipv6-host-scanning</a>&gt;.

       <b>HOST</b> <b>TRACKING</b>

       <b>scan6</b>  can  be  employed  to  track  IPv6  nodes  across  networks.  Since  IPv6  StateLess Address Auto-
       Configuration (SLAAC) typically results in globally-unique Interface Identifiers (IIDs) that are constant
       across networks, such identifiers can be leveraged to track nodes across a range of "known" networks,  by
       periodically  probing the IPv6 address composed of the IPv6 prefix of the target network, and the (known)
       Interface ID of the target node.

       For host-tracking purposes, the target networks can be specified with the '-d' and/or '-m' options, while
       the target Interface IDs can be specified with the '-w' and/or the '-W' options (see the documentation of
       each option for further information).

       Since for tracking purposes one will continually track the user across networks,  the  '-l'  option  will
       typically  be  set.  Additionally,  the '-z' option may be used to specify the number of seconds to sleep
       between iterations (i.e. each round of probes send to the specified targets). The value specified by  the
       '-z' option represents a trade-off between time-liness of the tracking and bandwidth-consumption.

       IPv6            host-tracking           is           discussed           in           detail           in
       &lt;<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6man-ipv6-address-generation-privacy">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6man-ipv6-address-generation-privacy</a>&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>scan6</b> takes its parameters as command-line options. Each of the options can be  specified  with  a  short
       name  (one  character  preceded  with  the  hyphen character, as e.g. "-i") or with a long name (a string
       preceded with two hyphen characters, as e.g. "--interface").

       <b>-i</b> <u>interface</u><b>,</b> <b>--interface</b> <u>interface</u>

              This option specifies the network interface to be used by the <b>scan6</b> tool, and  is  mandatory  when
              performing local address scans (-L option).

       <b>-s</b> <u>SRC_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--src-address</b> <u>SRC_ADDR</u>

              This  option  specifies  the  IPv6  Source  Address to be used for the Source Address of the probe
              packets. If a prefix is specified, the Source Address is randomly selected from that prefix.

              If this option is left unspecified, the addresses currently configured for the  specified  network
              interface card are used.

       <b>-d</b> <u>DST_ADDRESS</u><b>,</b> <b>--dst-address</b> <u>DST_ADDRESS</u>

              This  option  specifies the target address prefix/range of the address scan. An IPv6 prefix can be
              specified in the form 2001:db8::/64, or as 2001:db8:a-b:1-10 (where specific  address  ranges  are
              specified  for  the  two low order 16-bit words). This option must be specified for remote address
              scanning attacks.

       <b>-S</b> <u>SRC_LINK_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--link-src-address</b> <u>SRC_LINK_ADDR</u>

              This option specifies the link-layer Source Address of the probe packets (currently, only Ethernet
              is supported). If left unspecified, the real link-layer address of the interface is used.

              Note: Some systems may discard packets when the link-layer address is forged. That is,  even  when
              the relevant function calls (and hence the scan6 tool itself) may return "success", packets may be
              discarded  and  not  actually  sent  on  the  specified  network link. In such scenarios, the real
              Ethernet address should be used. This type of behaviour has been found in some Linux systems.

       <b>-p</b> <u>PROBE_TYPE</u><b>,</b> <b>--probe-type</b> <u>PROBE_TYPE</u>

              This option specifies the probe packets to be used for address scanning. For local-network address
              scans, possible arguments are: "echo" (for ICMPv6 Echo Request), "unrec" (for  IPv6  packets  with
              unrecognized IPv6 options of type 10xxxxxx), and "all" (for using both ICMPv6 Echo Requests probes
              and unrecognized options of type 10xxxxxx). If left unspecified, this option defaults to "all".

              For remote-network scans, this option defaults to "echo" (if left unspecified).

       <b>-P</b> <u>PAYLOAD_SIZE</u><b>,</b> <b>--payload-size</b> <u>PAYLOAD_SIZE</u>

              This  option specifies the payload size of the probe packet. It defaults to 0 for TCP (i.e., empty
              TCP segments), and to 56 for ICMPv6.

       <b>-o</b> <u>SRC_PORT</u><b>,</b> <b>--src-port</b> <u>SRC_PORT</u>

              This option specifies the TCP/UDP Source Port. If left unspecified, the Source Port is  randomized
              from the range 1024-65535.

       <b>-a</b> <u>DST_PORT</u><b>,</b> <b>--dst-port</b> <u>DST_PORT</u>

              This  option  specifies the TCP/UDP Destination Port. If left unspecified, the Destination Port is
              randomized from the range 1-1024.

       <b>-X</b> <u>TCP_FLAGS</u><b>,</b> <b>--tcp-flags</b> <u>TCP_FLAGS</u>

              This option is used to set specific the TCP flags. The flags  are  specified  as  "F"  (FIN),  "S"
              (SYN), "R" (RST), "P" (PSH), "A" (ACK), "U" (URG), "X" (no flags).

              If this option is left unspecified, the ACK bit is set on all probe packets.

       <b>-P</b> <u>ADDR_TYPE</u><b>,</b> <b>--print-type</b> <u>ADDR_TYPE</u>

              This  option  specifies  the  address types to be printed/informed by the <b>scan6</b> tool. The possible
              arguments are: "local" (link-local addresses), "global" (global addresses), and "all" (print  both
              link-local  and  global-addresses). If left unspecified, this option defaults to "all" (print both
              link-local and global-addresses).

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--print-unique</b>

              This option specifies that for each address scope (local and/or global) only one IPv6 address  per
              Ethernet  address  should  be  printed.  This option can be useful when interest is in identifying
              unique systems (e.g. for counting the number of systems connected to the  local  network),  rather
              than the number of configured addresses on the local network.

              Note:  In  the case of systems that implement "Privacy Extensions for SLAAC" (IETF RFC 4941), more
              than one global unicast address will typically be found by the scan6 tool.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--print-link-addr</b>

              This option specifies that the  link-layer  addresses  should  be  printed  along  with  the  IPv6
              addresses, with the format "IPV6ADDRESS @ LINKADDRESS".

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--print-timestamp</b>

              This  option  specifies  that  a  timestamp should be printed after the IPv6 address of each alive
              node.

       <b>-x</b> <u>NO_RETRANS</u><b>,</b> <b>--retrans</b> <u>NO_RETRANS</u>

              This option specifies the number of times probe packets should be retransmitted when  no  response
              is  received.  Note:  If  left  unspecified,  the number of retransmission defaults to 0 (i.e., no
              retransmissions).

              Note: this option might be useful when packets must traverse unreliable and/or  congested  network
              links.

       <b>-o</b> <u>TIMEOUT</u><b>,</b> <b>--timeout</b> <u>TIMEOUT</u>

              This option specifies the amount of time that the tool should wait for responses to probe packets.
              If left unspecified, the timeout value defaults to 1 second.

              Note: this option might be useful when scanning hosts on long-delay links.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--local</b>

              This  option  specifies  that  host  scanning should be performed on the local subnet. The type of
              probe packets to be used can be specified with the "-p" option.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--rand-link-src-addr</b>

              This option specifies that the Ethernet Source Address should be randomized.

       <b>-V</b> <u>VM_TYPE</u><b>,</b> <b>--tgt-virtual-machines</b> <u>VM_TYPE</u>

              This option  specifies  that  the  target  is  virtual  machines.  Possible  options  are:  'vbox'
              (VirtualBox),  'vmware'  (vmware),  and  'all'  (both  VirtualBox and vmware). When this option is
              specified, scan6 can narrow dow the search space by targeting only those IEEE OUIs employed by the
              aforementioned virtualization software. Note: For vmware, the search space can be further  reduced
              if the '--ipv4-host' option is specified.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--tgt-low-byte</b>

              This  option  specifies  that  the  target  is IPv6 nodes employing "low-byte" addresses. Low byte
              addresses are generated by concatenating the IPv6 prefix specified by  the  "-d"  option  with  an
              Interface I-D of the form "0:0:0-100:0-1500".

       <b>-B</b> <u>IPV4_ENCODING</u><b>,</b> <b>--tgt-ipv4</b> <u>IPV4_ENCODING</u>

              This  option  specifies  that  the  target  is IPv6 addresses that embed an IPv4 address. Possible
              encondings are "ipv4-32" (where the IPv4 address is embedded in the low-order 32 bits of the  IPv6
              address),  "ipv4-64"  (where  the  IPv4  address  is embedded in the low-order 64 bits of the IPv6
              address), and "ipv4-all" (which  is  equivalent  to  setting  both  the  "ipv4-32"  and  "ipv4-64"
              encodings).  When  this option is set, a prefix should be specified with the '--ipv4-host' option,
              such that the search space is reduced.

              Note: When an IPv4 address is encoded in 64 bits,  each  byte  of  the  IPv4  address  is  firstly
              converted  to  a  number  that  has  the  same  representation  in hexadecimal (e.g., 100 would be
              converted to 256, since the hexadecimal representation of  256  is  0x100)  before  that  byte  is
              embedded  in  a 16-bit word. For example, the IPv4 address 192.168.0.1 would result, when combined
              with the prefix 2001:db8::/32 in the IPv6 address 2001:db8::192:168:0:1 (note that while each byte
              of the original IPv4 address has the same representation within the IPv6 address, each  value  now
              stands for an hexadecimal number).

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--tgt-port</b>

              This  option  specifies  that  the  target  is  IPv6  addresses  that embed service ports (such as
              2001:db8::25, 2001:db8::80, etc.). When this option is set addresses containing these  ports  will
              be probed:

                    21 (ftp)
                    22 (ssh)
                    23 (telnet)
                    25 (smtp)

                   389 (ldap)
                   443 (https)
                   547 (dhcpv6-server)
                   993 (imaps)
                   995 (pop3s)
                  1194 (openvpn)
                  3306 (mysql)
                  5060 (sip)
                  5061 (sip-tls)
                  5432 (postgresql)
                  6446 (mysql-proxy)
                  8080 (http-alt)

             Note: The target IPv6 addresses are generated by concatenating
             the service port to an IPv6 prefix/range specified by means of
             the "-d" option. For each service port, four target address
             ranges will be generated:

                * PREFIX::0-5:HEX_PORT,
                * PREFIX::HEX_PORT:0-5,
                * PREFIX::0-5:DEC_PORT, and,
                * PREFIX::DEC_PORT:0-5

             That is, IPv6 address ranges will be generated with both the
             service port in hexadecimal notation, and the service port in
             decimal notation, since both types of addresses have been found
             in the wild.

       <b>-k</b> <u>IEEE_OUI</u><b>,</b> <b>--tgt-ieee-oui</b> <u>IEEE_OUI</u>

              This  option  is  used to specify an IEEE OUI, such that the target of the scan is SLAAC addresses
              that employ the aforementioned IEEE OUI.

       <b>-K</b> <u>VENDOR</u><b>,</b> <b>--tgt-vendor</b> <u>VENDOR</u>

              This option allows the user to specify a vendor name. scan6 will look-up  all  the  correspoinding
              IEEE  OUIs  for such vendor, and then scan for SLAAC addresses that employ the aforementioned IEEE
              OUIs.

       <b>-m</b> <u>PREFIXES_FILE</u><b>,</b> <b>--prefixes-file</b> <u>PREFIXES_FILE</u>

              This option specifies the name of a file containing a list of IPv6 addresses and/or IPv6 prefixes,
              one per line, in the same format as that used with the '-d' option. Note:  The  file  can  contain
              comments if they are preceded with the numeral sign ('#'), as in:

                      IPv6_address/len      # comment
                      # comment
                      IPv6_address

       <b>-w</b> <u>IIDS_FILE</u><b>,</b> <b>--tgt-iids-file</b> <u>IIDS_FILE</u>

              This option specifies the name of a file containing one IPv6 address per line. The Interface ID of
              each of those IPv6 addresses will be employed, together with the network prefix specified with the
              '-d'  option,  to  construct  the  IPv6  addresses  to  be probed. Since auto-configured addresses
              typically employ Interface IDs that are constant across networks, this option can  leverage  known
              IIDs       to       track       such       nodes       across       networks.      Please      see

       <b>-W</b> <u>IID</u><b>,</b> <b>--tgt-iid</b> <u>IID</u>

              This  option specifies an IPv6 Interface Identifier (IID), with the same syntax as that of an IPv6
              address (only the lowest-order 64 bits of the address will be employed). The  specified  Interface
              ID  will  be  employed,  together with the any network prefixes specified with the '-d' option (or
              with the '-m' option), to construct  the  IPv6  addresses  to  be  probed.  Since  auto-configured
              addresses  typically  employ  Interface  IDs  that  are  constant across networks, this option can
              leverage    known    IIDs    to    track    such    nodes    across    networks.    Please     see
              &lt;<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6man-ipv6-address-generation-privacy">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6man-ipv6-address-generation-privacy</a>&gt;  for further details.
              Note: The file can contain comments if they are preceded with the numeral sign ('#'), as in:

                      IPv6_address      # comment

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--sort-ouis</b>

              This option, when used in conjunction with the "--tgt-vendor" option,  tells  the  scan6  tool  to
              "sort"  the  IEEE  OUIs  corresponding to a vendor. Namely, OUIs are employed in descending order,
              with the largest OUI used last (together with the smallest OUI). The rationale for this option  is
              that  when  a  vendor has been assigned multiple OUIs, chances are that the smaller (and "oldest")
              OUI was used for devices that have already been put "out  of  service",  while  the  largest  (and
              "newest") OUI has probably not yet been used for deployed devices.

       <b>-Q</b> <u>PREFIX/LEN</u><b>,</b> <b>--ipv4-host</b> <u>PREFIX/LEN</u>

              This  option allows the user to specify an IPv4 prefix. The aforementioned prefix is employed with
              the "--tgt-virtual-machines" and/or "--tgc-ipv4-embeded" options to reduce the search space.

       <b>-I</b> <u>INC_SIZE</u><b>,</b> <b>--inc-size</b> <u>INC_SIZE</u>

              This option is used to specify the increment size for the lowest-order  16-bit  word  of  an  IPv6
              address  when  an  IPv6  address range is to be scanned. This option is particularly useful if the
              target network is assumed to contain a large number of nodes  with  consecutive  addresses  (maybe
              because  the  target network employs DHCPv6, or because the target network contains a large number
              of devices from the same  manufacturer,  thus  employing  consecutive  MAC/SLAAC  addresses).  The
              increment size should be that of the assumed size of the "cluster" of nodes.

       <b>-r</b> <u>RATE</u><b>,</b> <b>--rate-limit</b> <u>RATE</u>

              This  option  specifies the rate limit to use when performing a remote address scan. "RATE" should
              be specified as "Xbps" or "Xpps" (with "X" being an unsigned integer), for rate-limits in bits per
              second or packets per second, respectively.

              In general, the address scan should be rate-limited to about 80% (eighty percent) of  the  upstram
              bandwidth, such that probe packets are not lost as a result of network congestion.

              Note:  If left unspecified, the scan6 will rate-limit the probe packets to 1000 packets per second
              (pps).

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--loop</b>

              This option specifies that the tool should periodically loop through the specified targets. It  is
              mostly useful to e.g. when a node disconnects from the network, or for host-tracking purposes.

       <b>-z</b> <u>SECONDS</u><b>,</b> <b>--sleep</b> <u>SECONDS</u>

              This  option  specifies  the  amount  of  time  (in seconds) that the tool should sleep in-between
              iterations over the specified targets. It is only meaningful when the '-l' option is set.

       <b>-c</b> <u>CONFIG_FILE</u><b>,</b> <b>--config-file</b> <u>CONFIG_FILE</u>

              This option is used to specify an alternative configuration file. If left  unspecified,  the  tool
              will employ '/etc/ipv6toolkit.conf'.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>

              This  option selects the "verbosity" of the tool. If this option is left unspecified, only minimum
              information is printed. If this option is set once, additional information is printed  (e.g.,  the
              tool  indicates which addresses are "link-local" and which addresses are "global"). If this option
              is set twice, detailed information will be printed in the case the tool finds  any  problems  when
              performing host scanning.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>

              Print help information for the <b>scan6</b> tool.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following sections illustrate typical use cases of the <b>scan6</b> tool.

       <b>Example</b> <b>#1</b>

       # scan6 -i eth0 -L -e -v

       Perform  host  scanning on the local network ("-L" option) using interface "eth0" ("-i" option). Use both
       ICMPv6 echo requests and unrecognized IPv6 options of type  10xxxxxx  (default).  Print  link-link  layer
       addresses along with IPv6 addresses ("-e" option). Be verbose ("-v" option).

       <b>Example</b> <b>#2</b>

       # scan6 -d 2001:db8::/64 --tgt-virtual-machines all --ipv4-host 10.10.10.0/24

       Scan  for  virtual  machines  (both  VirtualBox  and  vmware) in the prefix 2001:db8::/64. The additional
       information about the IPv4 prefix employed by the host system is leveraged to reduce the search space.

       <b>Example</b> <b>#3</b>

       # scan6 -d 2001:db8::/64 --tgt-ipv4-embedded ipv4-32 --ipv4-host 10.10.10.0/24

       Scan for IPv6 addresses of the network 2001:db8::/64 that embed the IPv4 prefix 10.10.10.0/24  (with  the
       32-bit encoding).

       <b>Example</b> <b>#4</b>

       # scan6 -d 2001:db8:0-500:0-1000

       Scan  for  IPv6  addresses of the network 2001:db8::/64, varying the two lowest order 16-bit words of the
       addresses in the range 0-500 and 0-1000, respectively.

       <b>Example</b> <b>#5</b>

       # scan6 -d fc00::/64 --tgt-vendor 'Dell Inc' -p tcp

       Scan for network devices manufactured by 'Dell Inc' in the target prefix fc00::/64. The tool will  employ
       TCP segments as the probe packets (rather than the default ICMPv6 echo requests).

       <b>Example</b> <b>#6</b>

       # scan6 -i eth0 -L -S 66:55:44:33:22:11 -p unrec -P global -v

       Use  the  "eth0" interface ("-i" option) to perform host-scanning on the local network ("-L" option). The
       Ethernet Source Address is set to "66:55:44:33:22:11" ("-S" option).  The  probe  packets  will  be  IPv6
       packets  with  unrecognized  options of type 10xxxxxx ("-p" option). The tool will only print IPv6 global
       addresses ("-P" option). The tool will be verbose.

       <b>Example</b> <b>#7</b>

       # scan6 -d 2001:db8::/64 -w KNOWN_IIDS

       Perform an address scan of a set of known  hosts  listed  in  the  file  KNOWN_IIDS,  at  remote  network
       2001:db8::/64.  The target addresses are obtaining by concatenating the network prefix 2001:db8::/64 with
       the interface IDs of each of the addresses fund in the file KNOWN_IIDS.

       <b>Example</b> <b>#8</b>

       # scan6 -i eth0 -L -P global --print-unique -e

       Use the "eth0" interface ("-i" option) to perform host-scanning on the local network ("-L" option). Print
       only global unicast addresses  ("-P"  option),  and  at  most  one  IPv6  address  per  Ethernet  address
       ("--print-unique"  option). Ethernet addresses will be printed along with the corresponiding IPv6 address
       ("-e" option).

       <b>Example</b> <b>#9</b>

       # scan6 -m knownprefixes.txt -w knowniids.txt -l -z 60 -t -v

       Build the list of targets from the IPv6 prefixes  contained  in  the  file  'knownprefixes.txt'  and  the
       Interface  IDs (IIDs) contained in the file 'knowniids.txt'. Poll the targets periodically ("-l" option),
       and sleep 60 seconds after each iteration ("-z" option). Print a timestamp along the IPv6 address of each
       alive node ("-t" option). Be verbose ("-v" option).
