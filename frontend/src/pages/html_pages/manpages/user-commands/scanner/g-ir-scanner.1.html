</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       g-ir-scanner - Extracting C metadata from sources and headers

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>g-ir-scanner</b> [OPTION...] FILES...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       g-ir-scanner  is  a tool which generates GIR XML files by parsing headers and introspecting GObject based
       libraries. It is usually invoked during the normal build step for a project and the information is  saved
       to  disk  and  later installed, so that language bindings and other applications can use it. Header files
       and source files are passed in as arguments on the command line. The suffix determines whether a file  be
       treated  as  a  source file (.c) or a header file (.h). Currently only C based libraries are supported by
       the scanner.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--help</b> Show help options

       <b>--quiet</b>
              If passed, do not print details of normal operation.

       <b>--warn-all</b>
              Display warnings for public API which is not introspectable.

       <b>--warn-error</b>
              Make warnings be fatal errors.

       <b>--strict</b>
              Display warnings for strict introspectable API.

       <b>--format=</b><u>FORMAT</u>
              This parameters decides which the resulting format will be used. The default value is gir.

       <b>--include=</b><u>NAME</u>
              Add the specified introspection dependency  to  the  scanned  namespace.   NAME  is  of  the  form
              NAMESPACE-VERSION, like Gtk-3.0.

       <b>--include-uninstalled=</b><u>PATH</u>
              Add  the specified introspection dependency to the scanned namespace.  This differs from <b>--include</b>
              in that it takes a file path, and does not process the pkg-config dependencies (since they may not
              be installed yet).

       <b>--add-include-path=</b><u>PATH</u>
              Add a directory to the path which the scanner uses to find GIR files. Can be used  multiple  times
              to specify multiple directories

       <b>-i</b>,<u>--library</u><b>=LIBRARY</b>
              Specifies  a  library  that will be introspected. This means that the *_get_type() functions in it
              will be called for GObject data types. The name of the library should not contain the leading  lib
              prefix nor the ending shared library suffix.

       <b>-L</b>,<u>--library-path</u><b>=PATH</b>
              Include  this  directory when searching for a library. This option can be specified multiple times
              to include more than one directory to look for libraries in.

       <b>-I</b><u>directory</u>
              Include this directory in the list of directories to be searched for header  files.  You  need  to
              pass  to  the  scanner  all  the  directories  you'd  normally pass to the compiler when using the
              specified source files.

       <b>--c-include=</b><u>C_INCLUDES</u>
              Headers which should be included in C programs. This option can be  specified  multiple  times  to
              include more than one header.

       <b>-n</b>,<u>--namespace</u><b>=NAME</b>
              The  namespace  name.  This  name should be capitalized, eg the first letter should be upper case.
              Examples: Gtk, Clutter, WebKit.

       <b>--no-libtool</b>
              Disable usage of libtool for compiling stub introspection binary. Use this if  your  build  system
              does not require libtool.

       <b>--libtool</b>
              Full path to libtool executable. Typically used for Automake systems.

       <b>--nsversion=</b><u>VERSION</u>
              The  namespace  version.  For instance 1.0. This is usually the platform version, eg 2.0 for Gtk+,
              not 2.12.7.

       <b>-p</b>,<u>--program</u><b>=PROGRAM</b>
              Specifies a binary that will be introspected. This means that the  *_get_type()  functions  in  it
              will  be  called  for GObject data types. The binary must be modified to take a <b>--introspect-dump=</b>
              option, and to pass the argument to this function to g_irepository_dump.

       <b>--program-arg=</b><u>ARG</u>
              Additional argument to pass to program for introspection.

       <b>--identifier-prefix=</b><u>PREFIX</u>
              This option may be specified multiple times. Each one gives a prefix that will  be  stripped  from
              all  C identifiers. If none specified, the namespace will be used. Eg, an identifier prefix of Foo
              will export the identifier typdef struct _FooBar FooBar; as Foo.Bar.

       <b>--symbol-prefix=</b><u>PREFIX</u>
              This option may be specified multiple times. Each one gives a prefix that will  be  stripped  from
              all  C  symbols.  Eg,  an  symbol  prefix  of  foo  will export the symbol foo_bar_do_something as
              Foo.Bar.do_something.

       <b>--accept-unprefixed</b>
              If specified, the scanner will accept identifiers and symbols which do  not  match  the  namespace
              prefix. Try to avoid using this if possible.

       <b>--output=</b><u>FILENAME</u>
              Name of the file to output. Normally namespace + format extension. Eg, GLib-2.0.gir.

       <b>--pkg=</b><u>PACKAGE</u>
              List  of  pkg-config  packages to get compiler and linker flags from. This option can be specified
              multiple times to include flags from several pkg-config packages.

       <b>--pkg-export=</b><u>PACKAGE</u>
              List of pkg-config packages that are provided by the generated gir. This option can  be  specified
              multiple  times  if the gir provides more packages.  If not specified, the packages specified with
              <b>--pkg=</b> will be used.

       <b>--compiler=</b><u>COMPILER</u>
              The C compiler to be used  internally  by  g-ir-scanner  when  introspecting  the  run  time  type
              information,  like  properties,  signals,  ancestors,  and implemented interfaces. It has the same
              semantics as the <b>CC</b> environment variable.

       <b>--verbose</b>
              Be verbose, include some debugging information.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  g-ir-scanner  uses  the  <b>XDG_DATA_DIRS</b>  variable  to  check  for  dirs,  the  girs  are  located  in
       <b>XDG_DATA_DIRS/gir-1.0</b>. It is normally set on a distribution so you shouldn't need to set it yourself.

       The variable <b>GI_SCANNER_DISABLE_CACHE</b> ensures that the scanner will not write cache data to <b>$HOME</b>.

       The  variable <b>GI_SCANNER_DEBUG</b> can be used to debug issues in the build-system that involve g-ir-scanner.
       When it is set to <b>save-temps</b>, then g-ir-scanner will not remove temporary files and directories after  it
       terminates.

       The  variable <b>GI_HOST_OS</b> can be used to control the OS name on the host that runs the scanner. It has the
       same semantics as the Python <b>os.name</b> property.

       The variable <b>GI_CROSS_LAUNCHER</b>  can  be  used  to  wrap  the  GType  introspection  binary  generated  by
       g-ir-scanner  before executing it. It is useful when generating introspection data in a cross-compilation
       environment.
