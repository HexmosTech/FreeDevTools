       nbdkit-scan-filter - scan disk prefetching data ahead of sequential reads

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        nbdkit --filter=scan PLUGIN [scan-ahead=false] [scan-clock=false]
                                    [scan-forever=true] [scan-size=]NN

        nbdkit --filter=scan --filter=cache PLUGIN

        nbdkit --filter=scan --filter=cow PLUGIN cow-on-cache=true

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "nbdkit-scan-filter" is a filter that scans the disk prefetching data.  It is sometimes useful if you
       expect that the client will read the disk sequentially.

       The basic operation of the filter is that when a client connects, the filter will start issuing ".cache"
       (prefetch) requests to the plugin across the whole disk.  Plugins which support this command will
       prefetch the data, making subsequent reads faster.  For plugins which do not support this command, you
       can inject <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-cache-filter.1.html">nbdkit-cache-filter</a></b>(1) below (after) this filter, giving approximately the same effect.
       <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-cow-filter.1.html">nbdkit-cow-filter</a></b>(1) can be used instead of nbdkit-cache-filter, if you add the "cow-on-cache=true"
       option.

       Various parameters can be used to tune scanning, although the defaults should be suitable in most cases.

       A similar filter is <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-readahead-filter.1.html">nbdkit-readahead-filter</a></b>(1).

   <b>Limitations</b>
       In a number of significant cases this filter will do nothing.  The filter will print a warning message if
       this happens.

       Thread model must be parallel¹
           Use  "nbdkit PLUGIN --dump-plugin" to find the thread model of the underlying plugin.  If it does not
           support the "parallel" thread model, this filter cannot perform prefetches in parallel with the  read
           requests.

       Only scans while clients are connected¹
           The current filter only scans while there is at least one client connected.

       Only scans the default export¹
           The  current  filter  only  scans  the  default export and ignores all clients connecting to the non-
           default export name.

           ¹ We may be able to lift these restrictions in future.

       Underlying filters or plugin must support ".cache" (prefetch)
           Very many plugins do not have the concept  of  prefetching  and/or  do  not  implement  the  ".cache"
           callback, and so there is no way for this filter to issue prefetches.

           You can usually get around this by adding <u>--filter=cache</u> after this filter as explained above.

       Prefetching the whole disk may load it all into cache
           In  particular  if  you use this filter together with <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-cache-filter.1.html">nbdkit-cache-filter</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-cow-filter.1.html">nbdkit-cow-filter</a></b>(1),
           they will cache the whole content of the plugin into a temporary file.  This may be many gigabytes of
           data, consuming all space in <u><a href="file:/var/tmp">/var/tmp</a></u>.  Of course this is the whole point of using this  filter,  but
           you should be aware of it.

           If  using  the  cache filter, the total size of the cache can be limited (see "CACHE MAXIMUM SIZE" in
           <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-cache-filter.1.html">nbdkit-cache-filter</a></b>(1)).

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>scan-ahead=false</b>
           By default the filter tries to stay ahead of incoming read requests.   That  is  to  say,  it  starts
           prefetching at the beginning of the disk and continues incrementally, but if the client issues a read
           beyond  the  current  prefetch  point  then the filter skips forward and begins prefetching after the
           read.

           However if you set this parameter to false, then this  behaviour  is  disabled.   The  filter  simply
           prefetches sequentially regardless of client requests.

       <b>scan-clock=false</b>
           By  default,  if  all clients disconnect and then another client connects, prefetching resumes at the
           same place in the disk.  (Like stopping and starting a clock.)

           If you set this parameter to false, then the filter starts prefetching from the beginning of the disk
           again.

       <b>scan-forever=true</b>
           By default the filter scans over the disk once and then stops.

           If you set this parameter to true, then after the disk has been  prefetched  completely,  the  filter
           goes back to the beginning and starts over, repeating this for as long as nbdkit is running and there
           are clients connected.

       <b>scan-size=</b>NN
           This parameter controls the prefetch block size.  The default is "2M".  This must be a power of 2 and
           most plugins will have their own limits on the amount of data they can prefetch in a single request.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>$filterdir/nbdkit-scan-filter.so</u>
           The filter.

           Use "nbdkit --dump-config" to find the location of $filterdir.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       "nbdkit-scan-filter" first appeared in nbdkit 1.32.
