       sane-find-scanner - find SCSI and USB scanners and their device files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sane-find-scanner</b> [<b>-?</b>|<b>-h</b>|<b>--help</b>] [<b>-v</b>] [<b>-q</b>] [<b>-p</b>] [<b>-f</b>] [<b>-F</b> <u>filename</u>] [<u>devname</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sane-find-scanner</b>  is  a  command-line tool to find SCSI and USB scanners and determine their UNIX device
       files. Its primary aim is to make sure that scanners can be detected by SANE backends.

       For <b>SCSI</b> scanners, it checks the default generic SCSI device files  (e.g.,  <u>/dev/sg0</u>)  and  <u>/dev/scanner</u>.
       The  test  is  done  by  sending  a  SCSI  inquiry  command and looking for a device type of "scanner" or
       "processor" (some old HP scanners seem to send "processor"). So  <b>sane-find-scanner</b>  will  find  any  SCSI
       scanner connected to those default device files even if it isn't supported by any SANE backend.

       For  <b>USB</b>  scanners, first the USB kernel scanner device files (e.g.  <u>/dev/usb/scanner0</u>, <u>/dev/usb/scanner</u>,
       and <u>/dev/usbscanner</u>) are tested. The files are opened and the vendor and device ids  are  determined,  if
       the  operating  system  supports this feature. Currently USB scanners are only found this way if they are
       supported by the Linux scanner module or the  FreeBSD  or  OpenBSD  uscanner  driver.  After  that  test,
       <b>sane-find-scanner</b>  tries to scan for USB devices found by the USB library libusb (if available). There is
       no special USB class for scanners, so the heuristics used to distinguish scanners from other USB  devices
       is  not  perfect.   <b>sane-find-scanner</b> also tries to find out the type of USB chip used in the scanner. If
       detected, it will be printed after the vendor and product ids.   <b>sane-find-scanner</b>  will  even  find  USB
       scanners, that are not supported by any SANE backend.

       <b>sane-find-scanner</b>  won't  find  most  parallel port scanners, or scanners connected to proprietary ports.
       Some <b>parallel</b> <b>port</b> scanners may be detected by <u>sane-find-scanner</u> <u>-p</u> <u>.</u>  At the time of writing  this  will
       only detect Mustek parallel port scanners.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-?,</b> <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
               Prints a short usage message.

       <b>-v</b>      Verbose  output. If used once, <b>sane-find-scanner</b> shows every device name and the test result.  If
               used twice, SCSI inquiry information and the USB device descriptors are also printed.

       <b>-q</b>      Be quiet. Print only the devices, no comments.

       <b>-p</b>      Probe parallel port scanners.

       <b>-f</b>      Force  opening  all  explicitly  given  devices  as  SCSI  and  USB  devices.  That's  useful  if
               <b>sane-find-scanner</b> is wrong in determining the device type.

       <b>-F</b> <b>filename</b>
               filename  is  a file that contains USB descriptors in the format of /proc/bus/usb/devices as used
               by Linux.  <b>sane-find-scanner</b> tries to identify the chipset(s) of all USB scanners found in such a
               file. This option is useful for developers  when  the  output  of  <u>cat</u>  <u>/proc/bus/usb/devices</u>  is
               available but the scanner itself isn't.

       <b>devname</b> Test device file "devname". No other devices are checked if devname is given.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       <u>sane-find-scanner</u> <u>-v</u>
       Check all SCSI and USB devices for available scanners and print a line for every device file.

       <u>sane-find-scanner</u> <u>/dev/scanner</u>
       Look for a (SCSI) scanner only at /dev/scanner and print the result.

       <u>sane-find-scanner</u> <u>-p</u>
       Probe for parallel port scanners.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>PLATFORMS</b></h4><pre>
       USB  support  is  limited  to  Linux (kernel, libusb), FreeBSD (kernel, libusb), NetBSD (libusb), OpenBSD
       (kernel, libusb). Detecting the vendor and device ids only works with Linux or libusb.

       SCSI support is available on Irix, EMX, Linux, Next, AIX, Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and HP-UX.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       No support for most parallel port scanners yet.
       Detection of USB chipsets is limited to a few chipsets.
