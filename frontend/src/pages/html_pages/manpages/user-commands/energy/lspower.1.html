       lspower - enumerate power sources

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lspower</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program displays power sources available on this machine, and their status.

       The status is given as an icon:

       <b>✗</b>      a power source that's not present or somehow disabled

       <b>✓</b>      a power source that's not an (apparent) battery, that is working ok

       <b>+</b>      a battery that's currently charging

       <b>•</b>      a battery that's full or otherwise not charging

       <b>-</b>      a battery that's giving off its stored power

       If the charge level is known, it is displayed as well.  So are abnormal conditions such as overheating.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       The output is meant only for human consumption, and is not supposed to be screen-scraped.  For a program,
       it's much easier to read data from the kernel directly (<u><a href="file:/sys/class/power_supply/">/sys/class/power_supply/</a>*</u>).
