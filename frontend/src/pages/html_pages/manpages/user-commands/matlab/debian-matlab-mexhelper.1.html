       debian-matlab-mexhelper - helper to build Matlab extensions on Debian

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>debian-matlab-mexhelper</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] <u>&lt;package</u> <u>name&gt;</u> <u>&lt;mode&gt;</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  is  a  small helper that eases building and installing MEX extensions for Matlab toolbox packages in
       Debian binary packages. Because these packages cannot build-depend on Matlab (for obvious  reasons)  they
       need  to  compile  their extensions at installation time using a local Matlab installation. The helper is
       somewhat flexible by supporting custom  build,  install  and  clean  commands,  as  well  as  source  and
       destination directories.  It also deals with moving extensions into library directories and automatically
       symlinks them into the toolbox directory.

       There  are  two  major modes: 'install' to build, install and symlink extensions (useful in postinst) and
       'clean' to remove installed extensions and symlinks (useful in prerm).

       The command  to  build  the  extensions  is  invoked  in  the  source  directory.  By  default,  this  is
       /usr/src/matlab/&lt;package  name&gt;,  but can be overridden with the <b>--src-dir</b> option. Any optional 'install'
       (<b>--install-cmd</b>) and 'clean' (<b>--clean-cmd</b>) are invoked in the source directory too.

       Moreover, this helper  will  also  take  any  installed  extensions  from  a  default  installation  path
       /usr/share/matlab/site/m/&lt;package  name&gt;,  move them into /usr/lib/matlab/site/&lt;package name&gt; and symlink
       back to the original location.  These locations can be configured with the <b>--m-dir</b> and <b>--mex-dir</b>  options
       respectively.  Again,  this  step  is  optional  and  is  only  performed  if a package actually installs
       extensions inot this location.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>

              Print usage summary and option list.

       <b>--help</b>

              Print full help.

       <b>--version</b>

              Print version information and exit.

       <b>--build-cmd</b>

              Command to build the extensions in the source directory

       <b>--install-cmd</b>

              Command to install the extensions after building

       <b>--clean-cmd</b>

              Command to clean the source tree after installation. This is not the command that is  executed  in
              'clean' mode.

       <b>--src-dir</b>

              Directory with the extension sources. This is also the directory in which build, install and clean
              commands get invoked.

       <b>--mex-dir</b>

              Target directory into which binary extensions get moved.

       <b>--m-dir</b>

              Target directory in which symlinks to binary extensions get created.

       <b>--make</b>

              Set  default  commands  for  'build-cmd'  (make),  'install-cmd' (make install DESTDIR=$m_dir) and
              'clean-cmd' (make distclean) if no specific command has been provided via the respective options.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following call can be used in  a  package's  postinst  script  if  it  comes  with  a  Matlab  script
       'build_matlab.m'  that builds and installs its extension into the desired locations. The --src-dir option
       is used to point to a non-standard location of the extension sources.

       debian-matlab-mexhelper somepackagename install
              --src-dir /usr/src/dynare-matlab/mex/sources     --build-cmd 'matlab -nodesktop -nodisplay  -nojvm
              -r build_matlab'

       If  a  package  installs  extension  sources into the standard location and builds its extensions using a
       Makefile that support the DESTDIR for installing the built extensions and  a  'distclean'  target  it  is
       sufficient to run the following.

              debian-matlab-mexhelper somepackagename install --make

       Otherwise it is also possible to fully customize all commands.

       debian-matlab-mexhelper difficultpackage install
              --build-cmd  'make  -C src all toolbox MEXBIN="matlab-mex"'     --install-cmd 'make -C src install
              &amp;&amp; find . ! -wholename "./src" -name "*.mex?*" -print0  |  xargs  -0  -I  {}  cp  -v  --parent  {}
              /usr/share/difficultpackage'      --clean-cmd  'make  -C src distclean toolbox-distclean &amp;&amp; find .
              -name "*.mex?*" -delete'

       If a package uses debian-matlab-mexhelper to install extensions into the standard location it can also be
       used to remove all MEX extensions and created symlinks when a  package  is  removed  from  a  system.  To
       achieve this simply put the following call into a package's prerm script.

              debian-matlab-mexhelper packagename clean
