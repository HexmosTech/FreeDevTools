</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sympa-upgrade-shared - Migrating shared repository created by earlier versions

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         sympa upgrade shared LISTNAME@DOMAIN [ --fix_qencode ]

         sympa upgrade shared * [ --fix_qencode ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       " sympa upgrade shared" renames file names in shared repositories that may be incorrectly encoded because
       of previous Sympa versions.

       •   As  of Sympa 5.3a.8, file names in shared repository are Q-encoded, therefore made easier to store on
           any filesystem with any encoding.

       •   As of Sympa 6.1b.5,  Encoding  of  shared  documents  was  not  consistent  with  recent  version  of
           MIME::EncWords  module:  <b>MIME::EncWords::encode_mimewords()</b>  used  to encode characters "-!*+/".  Now
           these characters are preserved, according to RFC 2047 section 5.  We had to change encoding of shared
           documents according to new algorithm.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       LISTNAME@DOMAIN | "*"
           Specifies target list(s).

       --fix_qencode
           If specified, fixes Q-encoding changed on Sympa 6.1b.5.  Otherwise, applies Q-encoding introduced  by
           Sympa 5.3a.8.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       upgrade_shared_repository.pl appeared as separate executable on Sympa 6.2.17.

       Its function was moved to "sympa upgrade shared" on Sympa 6.2.71b.
