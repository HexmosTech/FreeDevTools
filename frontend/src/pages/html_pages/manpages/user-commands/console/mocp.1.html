</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       MOC - Console audio player

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mocp</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] [<u>FILE</u>|<u>DIR</u> ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       MOC is a console audio player with simple ncurses interface.  It supports OGG, WAV, MP3 and other
       formats.  Just run <b>mocp</b>, go to some directory using the menu and press enter to start playing the file.
       The program will automatically play the rest of the files in the directory.

       With no options and no file arguments the program begins in current directory, or in <b>MusicDir</b> if the
       <b>StartInMusicDir</b> option is set in the configuration file.  If you give a directory on the command line,
       MOC will try to go there.  If a playlist is given, then it is loaded.  With multiple files, playlists or
       directories, everything will be added to the playlist recursively (including the contents of any playlist
       given).  (Note that relative paths in playlists are resolved with respect to the directory of the
       playlist, or of the symlink being used to reference it.)

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       If an option can also be set in the configuration file the command line overrides it (but see the <b>-O</b>
       option for the list-valued configuration file options exception).

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--debug</b>
              Run  MOC in debug mode.  The client and server log a lot of information to debug files.  Don't use
              this;  the  server  log  is  large.   This  is  only  available  if  MOC  was   compiled   without
              <b>--disable-debug</b>.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--server</b>
              Run only the server and exit.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--foreground</b>
              Implies <b>-S</b>.  Run the server in foreground and log everything to stdout.

       <b>-R</b> <u>NAME</u>[<b>:</b>...], <b>--sound-driver</b> <u>NAME</u>[<b>:</b>...]
              Use  the  specified  sound driver(s).  They can be <b>OSS</b>, <b>ALSA</b>, <b>JACK</b>, <b>SNDIO</b> or <b>null</b> (for debugging).
              Some of the drivers may not have been compiled in.  This  option  is  called  <b>SoundDriver</b>  in  the
              configuration file.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--music-dir</b>
              Start in <b>MusicDir</b> (set in the configuration file).  This can be also set in the configuration file
              as <b>StartInMusicDir</b>.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--enqueue</b>
              Add files given after command line options to the queue.  Don't start the interface.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--append</b>
              Append  files,  directories  (recursively)  and  playlists given after command line options to the
              playlist.  Don't start the interface.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--clear</b>
              Clear the playlist.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--play</b>
              Start playing from the first item on the playlist.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--playit</b>
              Play files given on the command line without modifying the clients' playlists.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--next</b>
              Request playing the next song from the server's playlist.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--previous</b>
              Request playing the previous song from the server's playlist.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--stop</b>
              Request the server to stop playing.

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--exit</b>
              Bring down the server.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--pause</b>
              Request the server to pause playing.

       <b>-U</b>, <b>--unpause</b>
              Request the server to resume playing when paused.

       <b>-G</b>, <b>--toggle-pause</b>
              Toggle between play and pause.

       <b>-k</b> [<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>]<u>N</u>, <b>--seek</b> [<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>]<u>N</u>
              Seek forward (positive) or backward (negative) by <u>N</u> seconds in the file currently being played.

       <b>-T</b> <u>THEME</u>, <b>--theme</b> <u>THEME</u>
              Use  a  theme  file.   If  the  path  is  not  absolute,  the  file  will  be  searched   for   in
              <b>/usr/share/moc/themes/</b> (depends on installation prefix), <b><a href="file:~/.moc/themes/">~/.moc/themes/</a></b> and the current directory.

       <b>-C</b> <u>FILE</u>, <b>--config</b> <u>FILE</u>
              Use  the  specified  configuration  file (which must be readable) instead of the default.  As this
              file can specify commands which invoke other applications MOC will refuse to start if  it  is  not
              owned by either root or the current user, or if it is writable by anyone other than its owner.

       <b>--no-config</b>
              Do not read any configuration file but use the built-in defaults.

       <b>-O</b> <u>NAME</u>[<b>+</b>]<b>=</b><u>VALUE</u>, <b>--set-option</b> <u>NAME</u>[<b>+</b>]<b>=</b><u>VALUE</u>
              Override  configuration file option NAME with VALUE.  This option can be repeated as many times as
              needed and the option name is  not  case  sensitive.   Most  option  values  are  set  before  the
              configuration  file  is  processed (which allows the new values to be picked up by substitutions);
              however, list-valued options are overridden afterwards (which gives  the  choice  of  whether  the
              configured values are replaced or added to).

              See the example configuration file (<b>config.example</b>) for a description of the options available.

              Examples: <b>-O</b> <b>AutoNext=no</b>
                        <b>-O</b> <b>messagelingertime=1</b> <b>-O</b> <b>XTerms+=xxt:xwt</b>

              Note  that  MOC  does  not  perform  variable  substitution  as  it  does for values read from the
              configuration file.

       <b>-M</b> <u>DIR</u>, <b>--moc-dir</b> <u>DIR</u>
              Use the specified MOC directory instead of the default.  This also causes the  configuration  file
              from  that  directory  to be used.  This can also be specified in the configuration file using the
              <b>MOCDir</b> option.

       <b>-y</b>, <b>--sync</b>
              This copy of the interface will synchronize its playlist  with  other  clients.   This  option  is
              called <b>SyncPlaylist</b> in the configuration file.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--nosync</b>
              This copy of the interface will not synchronize its playlist with other clients (see above).

       <b>-A</b>, <b>--ascii</b>
              Use ASCII characters to draw lines.  (This helps on some terminals.)

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--info</b>
              Print the information about the file currently being played.

       <b>-Q</b> <u>FORMAT_STRING</u>, <b>--format</b> <u>FORMAT_STRING</u>
              Print  information  about  the  file currently being played using a format string.  Replace string
              sequences with the actual information:

                       <b>%state</b>     State
                       <b>%file</b>      File
                       <b>%title</b>     Title
                       <b>%artist</b>    Artist
                       <b>%song</b>      SongTitle
                       <b>%album</b>     Album
                       <b>%tt</b>        TotalTime
                       <b>%tl</b>        TimeLeft
                       <b>%ts</b>        TotalSec
                       <b>%ct</b>        CurrentTime
                       <b>%cs</b>        CurrentSec
                       <b>%b</b>         Bitrate
                       <b>%r</b>         Rate

              It is also possible to use variables from the <b>FormatString</b> configuration file option.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--recursively</b>
              Alias of <b>-a</b> for backward compatibility.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print a list of options with short descriptions and exit.

       <b>--usage</b>
              Print a synopsis of the mocp command and exit.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Print the program version and exit.

       <b>--echo-args</b>
              Print the POPT-interpreted command line arguments and exit.

       <b>-v</b> [<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>]<u>N</u>, <b>--volume</b> [<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>]<u>N</u>
              Adjust the mixer volume.  You can set (<b>-v</b> <b>50</b>) or adjust (<b>-v</b> <b>+10</b>, <b>-v</b> <b>-10</b>).

       <b>-t</b> <u>OPTION</u>[<b>,</b>...], <b>--toggle</b> <u>OPTION</u>[<b>,</b>...]
       <b>-o</b> <u>OPTION</u>[<b>,</b>...], <b>--on</b> <u>OPTION</u>[<b>,</b>...]
       <b>-u</b> <u>OPTION</u>[<b>,</b>...], <b>--off</b> <u>OPTION</u>[<b>,</b>...]
              Followed by a list of identifiers, these will control MOC's playlist options.   Valid  identifiers
              are  <b>shuffle</b>,  <b>repeat</b> and <b>autonext</b>.  They can be shortened to '<b>s</b>', '<b>r</b>' and '<b>n</b>' respectively.  Both
              the identifiers and short forms are case insensitive.

              Example: <b>-t</b> <b>shuffle,R,n</b>
                       would toggle shuffle, repeat and autonext all at once.

       <b>-j</b> <u>N</u>{<b>s</b>|<b>%</b>}, <b>--jump</b> <u>N</u>{<b>s</b>|<b>%</b>}
              Jump to some position in the current file.  <u>N</u> is the number of seconds (when followed by  an  '<b>s</b>')
              or the percent of total file time (when followed by a '<b>%</b>').

              Examples: <b>-j</b> <b>10s</b>, <b>-j</b> <b>50%</b>

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>POPT</b> <b>ALIASES</b></h4><pre>
       MOC  uses  the  POPT  library  to  process its command line.  This allows users to assign MOC options and
       arguments to an alias of their choosing.  The aliases are just lines in the <b><a href="file:~/.popt">~/.popt</a></b> text  file  and  have
       the general form:

              <b>mocp</b> <b>alias</b> <u>newoption</u> <u>expansion</u>

       This  works  as  if  <u>expansion</u>  textually  replaces  <u>newoption</u>  on  the command line.  The replacement is
       recursive; that is, other <u>newoption</u>s can be embedded in the <u>expansion</u>.  The <u>expansion</u> is parsed similarly
       to a shell command, which allows \, ", and ' to be used  for  quoting.   If  a  backslash  is  the  final
       character  on  a  line,  the  next  line  in the file is assumed to be a logical continuation of the line
       containing the backslash, just as in the shell.  The <u>newoption</u> can be either a short or long option,  and
       any syntactically valid name the user wishes to use.

       If you add a description for the new option and/or for any argument by appending the special POPT options
       <b>--POPTdesc</b>  and  <b>--POPTargs</b>,  then the option will be displayed in the output of <b>--help</b> and <b>--usage</b>.  The
       value for these two options are strings of the form <b>$"</b><u>string</u><b>"</b>.

       So, for example:

              <b>mocp</b> <b>alias</b> <b>--single</b> <b>-D</b> <b>--set-option</b> <b>autonext=no</b> <b>\</b>
                         <b>--POPTdesc=$"Play</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> <b>selected"</b>

       would allow the user to turn on logging (<b>-D</b>)  and  override  the  configuration  file's  <b>AutoNext</b>  option
       setting just by using <b>--single</b> as an option to the mocp command.

       Sometimes  you  may wish to provide values to aliased options from the command line.  If just one aliased
       option has such a value, then it's a simple matter of placing it last:

              <b>mocp</b> <b>alias</b> <b>--yours</b> <b>--sound-driver</b> <b>OSS</b> <b>--theme</b>

       when used like this:

              <b>mocp</b> <b>--yours</b> <b>your_theme</b>

       would result in:

              <b>mocp</b> <b>--sound-driver</b> <b>OSS</b> <b>--theme</b> <b>your_theme</b>

       But aliasing multiple options with such values means making  use  of  the  special  construct  <b>!#:+</b>  (and
       quoting carefully):

              <b>mocp</b> <b>alias</b> <b>-1</b> <b>"-R</b> <b>!#:+"</b> <b>"-T</b> <b>my_theme"</b> <b>"-O</b> <b>!#:+"</b>

       when used like this:

              <b>mocp</b> <b>-1</b> <b>OSS</b> <b>shuffle=yes</b> <b><a href="file:~/my_music">~/my_music</a></b>

       would result in:

              <b>mocp</b> <b>-R</b> <b>OSS</b> <b>-T</b> <b>my_theme</b> <b>-O</b> <b>shuffle=yes</b> <b><a href="file:~/my_music">~/my_music</a></b>

       There  is  also a <b><a href="file:~/.popt">~/.popt</a></b> entry which allows for the execution of a different program when the associated
       option is used.  For this, an <b>exec</b> is used in place of the <b>alias</b> and the <u>expansion</u> is the program  to  be
       executed:

              <b>mocp</b> <b>exec</b> <b>--help</b> <b><a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?man">/usr/bin/man</a></b> <b>1</b> <b>mocp</b> <b>\</b>
                         <b>POPTdesc=$"Provide</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>page</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>help"</b>

       This would override the usual MOC <b>--help</b> output and use the system's <b>man</b> program to present this man page
       instead.

       Note  that while <b><a href="file:~/.popt">~/.popt</a></b> (or <b>/etc/popt</b>) is the default POPT configuration file, you can nominate specific
       file(s) to be used instead via the <b>MOCP_POPTRC</b> environment variable.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables are used directly by MOC.  Additional variables may  be  relevant  to
       the  libraries  MOC  uses.   Also,  any  environment  environment  variable  may  be  substituted  into a
       configuration file option value (see the 'config.example' file for details).

       <b>ESCDELAY</b>
              An <a href="../man3X/ncurses.3X.html">ncurses</a>(3X) variable which specifies the delay (in milliseconds) after which it will  treat  an
              ESC  as  a  standalone  key and not part of an escaped character sequence (such as is generated by
              function keys).  MOC sets this value to 25ms by default, which is sufficient for most systems.

       <b>HOME</b>   Tells MOC where your home directory is located and is used for  various  purposes,  including  the
              default location of the MOC directory.

       <b>MOCP_OPTS</b>
              The  value  of  this  variable  will  be  prepended  to  the  command line options before they are
              processed.

       <b>MOCP_POPTRC</b>
              A colon-separated list of POPT configuration files which will be loaded in sequence by MOC  during
              initialisation.   If  the variable is unset then the default POPT configuration file will be used.
              If the variable is set but empty then no POPT configuration file will be loaded.  If the  variable
              is set then those files which exist will be loaded and those which don't will be skipped.

              As  these  files can specify commands which invoke other applications, MOC will refuse to start if
              they are not owned by root or the current user, or they are writable by anyone  other  than  their
              owner.

       <b>TERM</b> and <b>WINDOW</b>
              Used  by  MOC  to  distinguish between X-terminals, <a href="../man1/screen.1.html">screen</a>(1) and console terminals.  MOC uses the
              configuration file options <b>XTerms</b> and <b>ScreenTerms</b> to help make this determination.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="file:~/.moc">~/.moc</a></b> MOC directory for the configuration file, socket, the pid file and other data.

       <b><a href="file:~/.moc/config">~/.moc/config</a></b>
              Configuration file for MOC.  The format is very simple; to see how to use it look at  the  example
              configuration  file  (<b>config.example</b>)  distributed  with  the  program.   The  example  file fully
              describes all the configuration options, and so is a useful reference when using  the  <b>-O</b>  option.
              As  this  file can specify commands which invoke other applications MOC will refuse to start if it
              is not owned by either root or the current user, or if it is writable by  anyone  other  than  its
              owner.

       <b><a href="file:~/.popt">~/.popt</a></b>
       <b>/etc/popt</b>
              The default files POPT reads to obtain aliased options.  As these files can specify commands which
              invoke  other  applications,  MOC  will  refuse to start if it is not owned by root or the current
              user, or if it is writable by anyone other than its owner.  (Also see the <b>MOCP_POPTRC</b>  environment
              variable above.)

       <b><a href="file:~/.moc/themes">~/.moc/themes</a></b>
       <b>/usr/share/moc/themes</b>
              Default directories for the theme files.

       <b>/usr/share/moc/decoder_plugins</b>
              Default directories for the audio decoder plugins.

       <b>mocp_client_log</b>
       <b>mocp_server_log</b>
              Client  and  server  log  files.  These files are created in the directory in which the client and
              server are started.  (Also see the <b>-D</b> option.)

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Command line options that affect the server behaviour (like <b>--sound-driver</b>) are ignored if the server  is
       already running at the time of executing <b>mocp</b>.  The user is not warned about this.
