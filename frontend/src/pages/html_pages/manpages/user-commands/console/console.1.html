</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Console</b> is used to manipulate console terminals remotely or to  poll  running  <b><a href="../man8/conserver.8.html">conserver</a></b>(8)  daemons  for
       status information.

       In the first form above, <b>console</b> asks the user's password before granting interactive access to a console
       (on  a  non-trusted  system),  since  such  a  session  may  provide single-user access.  If the server's
       autocompletion feature is enabled, only as much of the  console  name  as  is  required  to  identify  it
       uniquely to the server is required.

       For non-interactive options, <b>console</b> outputs only the requested information and exits.

       <b>Console</b> knows only of a primary <b>conserver</b> host (see the <b>-M</b> option below), to which it initially connects.
       In a multi-server environment, the primary server may refer the client to a different server handling the
       requested  console, or it will provide a list of all servers if required (as when <b>console</b> is invoked with
       the <b>-r</b> option).  <b>Console</b> then opens connections to the appropriate server(s).  It is  not  necessary  for
       the user of <b>console</b> to know which server manages which consoles, as long as <b>console</b> knows a valid primary
       server and all available consoles are listed in the primary server's configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options  may  be  given  as separate arguments (e.g., <b>-v</b> <b>-w</b>) or clustered (e.g., <b>-vw</b>).  Options and their
       arguments may be separated by  optional  white  space.   Option  arguments  containing  spaces  or  other
       characters special to the shell must be quoted.

       <b>-7</b>         Strip  the  high  bit  off  of  all data received, whether from user input or from the server,
                  before any processing occurs.  Disallows escape sequence characters with the high bit set.

       <b>-a</b>         Access a console with a two-way (read-write) connection (this is the default).  The connection
                  is dropped to spy mode if someone else is attached read-write.

       <b>-b</b><u>message</u>  Broadcast a <u>message</u> to all users connected to each server.

       <b>-B</b><u>message</u>  Same as <b>-b</b> but just send a <u>message</u> to users on the primary server.

       <b>-c</b><u>cred</u>     Load an SSL certificate and key from the PEM encoded file <u>cred</u>.

       <b>-C</b><u>config</u>   Use the per-user configuration file <u>config</u>.

       <b>-d</b>         Disconnect the  users  specified  by  <u>user</u>@<u>console</u>.   You  may  specify  the  target  as  <u>user</u>
                  (disconnect  the  <u>user,</u> regardless of what console they are attached to), @<u>console</u> (disconnect
                  all users attached to <u>console</u>), or <u>user</u>@<u>console</u> (disconnect the <u>user</u> attached to <u>console</u>).

       <b>-D</b>         Enable debugging output.

       <b>-e</b><u>esc</u>      Set the initial two-character escape sequence to those represented by <u>esc</u>.  Any of  the  forms
                  output by <b><a href="../man1/cat.1.html">cat</a></b>(1)'s <b>-v</b> option are accepted.  The default value is ``<b>^Ec</b>''.

       <b>-E</b>         If encryption has been built into the code (<b>--with-openssl</b>), encrypted client connections are,
                  by  default,  a  requirement.   This  option  disables  any  attempt  at creating an encrypted
                  connection.  If you'd like to use encrypted connections when  your  server  supports  it,  but
                  fallback to non-encrypted otherwise, the <b>-U</b> option is what you want.

       <b>-f</b>         Same as <b>-a</b> except it will force any existing connection into spy mode.

       <b>-h</b>         Display a brief help message.

       <b>-i</b>         Display status information in a machine-parseable format (see below for the details).

       <b>-I</b>         Same as <b>-i</b> but just acts on the primary server.

       <b>-k</b>         Abort the connection if the console is not in the `up' state immediately upon connecting.

       <b>-l</b><u>user</u>     Set the login name used for authentication to <u>user</u>.  By default, <b>console</b> uses $USER if its uid
                  matches  the  user's real uid, or $LOGNAME if its uid matches the user's real uid, or else the
                  name associated with the user's real uid.

       <b>-M</b><u>master</u>   The <b>console</b> client program polls <u>master</u> as the primary server, rather than the default set  at
                  compile time (typically ``<b>console</b>'').  The default <u>master</u> may be changed at compile time using
                  the  <b>--with-master</b> option.  If <b>--with-uds</b> is used to enable Unix domain sockets, however, this
                  option points <b>console</b> to  the  directory  which  holds  those  sockets.   The  default  <u>master</u>
                  directory (``<b>/tmp/conserver</b>'') may be changed at compile time using the <b>--with-uds</b> option.

       <b>-n</b>         Do not read the system-wide configuration file.

       <b>-p</b><u>port</u>     Set  the port to connect to.  This may be either a port number or a service name.  The default
                  <u>port</u> may be changed at compile time using the <b>--with-port</b> option.  If  the  <b>--with-uds</b>  option
                  was used, this option is ignored.

       <b>-P</b>         Display the pid of the master daemon process on each server.

       <b>-q</b>         The <b>console</b> client connects to each server to request that the server daemon quit (shut down).
                  The root password of the host(s) running conserver is required unless the local host is listed
                  as ``trusted'' in the conserver.cf file; in that case, just press &lt;return&gt;.

       <b>-Q</b>         Same as <b>-q</b> but just acts on the primary server.

       <b>-r</b>         Display  daemon  versions.   The <b>console</b> client connects to each server to request its version
                  information.

       <b>-R</b>         Same as <b>-r</b> but just acts on the primary server.

       <b>-s</b>         Request a read-only (spy mode) connection.  In this mode  all  the  escape  sequences  (below)
                  work, or report errors, but all other keyboard input is discarded.

       <b>-t</b>         Send  a  text  <u>message</u>  to  <u>user</u>@<u>console</u>.   You  may specify the target as <u>user</u> (send to <u>user,</u>
                  regardless of what console they are attached to), @<u>console</u> (send  to  all  users  attached  to
                  <u>console</u>), or <u>user</u>@<u>console</u> (send to <u>user</u> attached to <u>console</u>).

       <b>-u</b>         Show  a  list  of  all  consoles  with  status  (`up',  `down',  or `init') and attached users
                  (<u>user</u>@<u>host</u> if attached read-write, `&lt;spies&gt;' if only users in spy mode, or `&lt;none&gt;').

       <b>-U</b>         If encryption has been built into the code (<b>--with-openssl</b>), encrypted client connections are,
                  by default, a requirement.  This option allows the client to attempt an  encrypted  connection
                  but  fall back to a non-encrypted connection if the server doesn't support encryption.  If the
                  encryption handshake is failing, disabling encryption on the client  with  the  <b>-E</b>  option  is
                  probably what you want.

       <b>-v</b>         Be  more  verbose when building the connection(s).  Use this option in combination with any of
                  `show' options (below) for added benefit.

       <b>-V</b>         Output the version and settings of the console client program and then exit.

       <b>-w</b>         Show a list of all who are currently connected to consoles, including the hostnames where  the
                  <b>console</b>  connections  originate  and  the  idle  times.   This  is useful to see if anybody is
                  actively using the console system if it becomes necessary to shut down <b>conserver</b>.

       <b>-W</b>         Same as <b>-w</b> but just acts on the primary server.

       <b>-x</b>         Show a list of consoles and devices.

       <b>-z</b><u>cmd</u>      Sends a command (<u>cmd</u>) to each server and displays the result.  The valid commands are:

                  <b>bringup</b>     Try to connect all consoles marked as down (this  is  equivalent  to  sending  the
                              server a SIGUSR1)
                  <b>SIGUSR1</b>     Same as <b>bringup</b>
                  <b>help</b>        Displays the help message
                  <b>pid</b>         Returns the pid of the server (this is equivalent to <b>-P</b>)
                  <b>quit</b>        Instructs  the server to shut down (this is equivalent to <b>-q</b> or sending the server
                              a SIGTERM)
                  <b>SIGTERM</b>     Same as <b>quit</b>
                  <b>reconfig</b>    Instructs the server to reload the configuration file, then perform the actions of
                              <b>reopen</b> (this is equivalent to sending the server a SIGHUP)
                  <b>SIGHUP</b>      Same as <b>reconfig</b>
                  <b>reopen</b>      Instructs the server to reopen all logfiles, then perform the actions  of  <b>bringup</b>
                              (this is equivalent to sending the server a SIGUSR2)
                  <b>SIGUSR2</b>     Same as <b>reopen</b>
                  <b>version</b>     Returns the version of the server (this is equivalent to <b>-V</b>)

       <b>-Z</b><u>cmd</u>      Same as <b>-z</b> but just sends <u>cmd</u> to the primary server.

       The  <b>-A</b>,  <b>-F</b>,  or  <b>-S</b>  options have the same effect as their lower-case variants.  In addition, they each
       request the last 20 lines of the console output after making the connection (as if ``<b>^Ecr</b>'' were typed).

       The <b>-i</b>, <b>-u</b>, <b>-w</b>, and <b>-x</b> options can be given a console  name,  which  will  limit  their  output  to  that
       console.

       The <b>-i</b> option outputs status information regarding each console in 15 colon-separated fields.

       <u>name</u>   The name of the console.

       <u>hostname,pid,socket</u>
              The hostname, pid, and socket number of the child process managing the console.

       <u>type</u>   The type of console.  Values will be a `/' for a local device, `|' for a command, `!' for a remote
              port, `%' for a Unix domain socket, and `#' for a noop console.

       <u>console-details</u>
              The  details  regarding  the console.  The values here (all comma-separated) depend on the type of
              the console.  Local devices will have values of  the  device  file,  baud  rate/parity,  and  file
              descriptor  for  the  device.   Commands  will  have values of the command, the command's pid, the
              pseudo-tty, and file descriptor for the pseudo-tty.  Remote ports will have values of  the  remote
              hostname,  remote  port number, ``raw'' or ``telnet'' protocol, and file descriptor for the socket
              connection.  Unix domain sockets will have the path to the socket and the file descriptor for  the
              socket connection.  Noop consoles will have nothing.

       <u>users-list</u>
              The details of each user connected to the console.  The details for each user are an `@' separated
              list of `w', `r', or `s' (for read-write, read-only, or suspended), username, hostname the user is
              on,  the  user's  idle  time, and (for `r' and `s' users only) ``rw'' or ``ro'' (if the user wants
              read-write mode or not).  Each user bundle is separated by commas.

       <u>state</u>  The state of the console.  Values with either be ``up'', ``down'', or ``init''.

       <u>perm</u>   This value will either be ``rw'' or ``ro''.  It will only be ``ro'' if  the  console  is  a  local
              device (`/' type) and the permissions are such that the server can open the file for read, but not
              write.

       <u>logfile-details</u>
              The  details  regarding  the  logging  for  the  console.   The comma-separated values will be the
              logfile, ``log'' or ``nolog'' (if logging is on  or  not  -  toggled  via  ``^EcL''),  ``act''  or
              ``noact''  (if  activity  logging  is  enabled  or  not - the `a' timestamp option), the timestamp
              interval, and the file descriptor of the logfile.

       <u>break</u>  The default break sequence used for the console.

       <u>reup</u>   If the console is currently down and the automatic reconnection code is at work, it will have  the
              value of ``autoup'', otherwise it will be ``noautoup''.

       <u>aliases</u>
              The console aliases are presented in a comma-separated list.

       <u>options</u>
              The active options for the console are presented in a comma-separated list.

       <u>initcmd</u>
              The initcmd configuration option for the console.

       <u>idletimeout</u>
              The idletimeout configuration option for the console.

       <u>idlestring</u>
              The idlestring configuration option for the console.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Console</b>  reads  configuration  information from the system-wide configuration file (<b>console.cf</b>), then the
       per-user configuration file (<b>.consolerc</b>), and then applies command-line  arguments.   Each  configuration
       location can override the previous.  The same happens when parsing an individual file - the later entries
       always  override the earlier entries.  Because of that, you should put ``global'' defaults first and more
       specific defaults second.

       The configuration file is read using the same parser  as  <b><a href="../man5/conserver.cf.5.html">conserver.cf</a></b>(5),  and  you  should  check  that
       manpage for parser details.  <b>Console</b> recognizes the following configuration blocks.

       <b>config</b> <u>hostname</u>|<u>ipaddr</u>
              Define  a  configuration block for the client host named <u>hostname</u> or using the address <u>ipaddr</u>.  If
              the value of ``*'' is used, the configuration block will be applied to all client hosts.

              <b>escape</b> <u>esc</u>
                     Set the escape sequence (see the <b>-e</b> command-line flag).

              <b>master</b> <u>master</u>
                     Set the default master to <u>master</u> (see the <b>-M</b> command-line flag).

              <b>playback</b> <u>num</u>|<b>""</b>
                     Override the playback length for the <b>p</b> escape command to <u>num</u> lines (if the server  supports
                     it).   Using the special value of ``0'' will cause the client to use the number of lines of
                     the current terminal (if that can be determined).  If the null string (``""'') is used, the
                     playback length will not be overridden.

              <b>port</b> <u>port</u>
                     Set the default port to <u>port</u> (see the <b>-p</b> command-line flag).

              <b>replay</b> <u>num</u>|<b>""</b>
                     Override the replay length for the <b>r</b> escape command to <u>num</u> lines (if  the  server  supports
                     it).   Using the special value of ``0'' will cause the client to use the number of lines of
                     the current terminal (if that can be determined).  If the null string (``""'') is used, the
                     replay length will not be overridden.

              <b>sslcacertificatefile</b> <u>filename</u>
                     Load the valid CA certificates for the SSL connection from the PEM encoded file.

              <b>sslcacertificatepath</b> <u>directory</u>
                     Load the valid CA certificates for the SSL connection from the PEM  encoded  files  in  the
                     directory.

              <b>sslcredentials</b> <u>filename</u>
                     Set the SSL credentials file location (see the <b>-c</b> command-line flag).

              <b>sslenabled</b> <b>yes</b>|<b>true</b>|<b>on</b>|<b>no</b>|<b>false</b>|<b>off</b>
                     Set whether or not encryption is attempted when talking to servers (see the <b>-E</b> command-line
                     flag).

              <b>sslrequired</b> <b>yes</b>|<b>true</b>|<b>on</b>|<b>no</b>|<b>false</b>|<b>off</b>
                     Set  whether or not encryption is required when talking to servers (see the <b>-U</b> command-line
                     flag).

              <b>striphigh</b> <b>yes</b>|<b>true</b>|<b>on</b>|<b>no</b>|<b>false</b>|<b>off</b>
                     Set whether or not to strip the high bit off all data received  (see  the  <b>-7</b>  command-line
                     flag).

              <b>username</b> <u>user</u>
                     Set the username passed to the server to <u>user</u> (see the <b>-l</b> command-line flag).

       <b>terminal</b> <u>type</u>
              Define  a  configuration block when using a terminal of type <u>type</u>.  If the value of ``*'' is used,
              the configuration block will be applied to all terminal types.

              <b>attach</b> <u>string</u>|<b>""</b>
                     Set a <u>string</u> to print when successfully attached to a console.  Character substitions  will
                     be  performed based on the <b>attachsubst</b> value and occur <u>before</u> interpretation of the special
                     characters below.  If the null string (``<b>""</b>'') is used, no string will be printed.   <u>string</u>
                     is a simple character string with the exception of `\' and `^':

                            <b>\a</b>    alert
                            <b>\b</b>    backspace
                            <b>\f</b>    form-feed
                            <b>\n</b>    newline
                            <b>\r</b>    carriage-return
                            <b>\t</b>    tab
                            <b>\v</b>    vertical-tab
                            <b>\\</b>    backslash
                            <b>\^</b>    circumflex
                            <b>\</b><u>ooo</u>  octal representation of a character (where <u>ooo</u> is one to three octal digits)
                            <b>\</b><u>c</u>    character <u>c</u>
                            <b>^?</b>    delete
                            <b>^</b><u>c</u>    control character (<u>c</u> is ``and''ed with 0x1f)

                     An interesting use of <b>attach</b> and <b>attachsubst</b> would be:

                            terminal xterm {
                                attach "^[]0;conserver: U@C^G";
                                attachsubst U=us,C=cs;
                            }

              <b>attachsubst</b> <u>c</u><b>=</b><u>t</u>[<u>n</u>]<u>f</u>[<b>,</b>...]|<b>""</b>
                     Perform  character  substitutions  on  the  <b>attach</b>  value.  A series of replacements can be
                     defined by specifying a comma-separated list of <u>c</u><b>=</b><u>t</u>[<u>n</u>]<u>f</u> sequences where <u>c</u> is any  printable
                     character,  <u>t</u> specifies the replacement value, <u>n</u> is a field length (optional), and <u>f</u> is the
                     format string.  <u>t</u> can be one of the characters below, catagorized as a  string  replacement
                     or a numeric replacement, which dictates the use of the <u>n</u> and <u>f</u> fields.

                            String Replacement
                            <b>u</b>      username
                            <b>c</b>      console name

                            Numeric Replacement
                            none available (yet)

                     For  string replacements, if the replacement isn't at least <u>n</u> characters, it will be padded
                     with space characters on the left.  <u>f</u> must be `s'.  For  numeric  replacements,  the  value
                     will  be formatted to at least <u>n</u> characters, padded with 0s if <u>n</u> begins with a 0, and space
                     characters otherwise.  <u>f</u> must be either `d', `x' or `X', specifying a  decimal,  lower-case
                     hexadecimal,  or an uppercase hexadecimal conversion.  If the null string (``<b>""</b>'') is used,
                     no replacements will be done.

              <b>detach</b> <u>string</u>|<b>""</b>
                     Set a <u>string</u> to print  once  detached  from  a  console.   Character  substitions  will  be
                     performed  based  on  the  <b>detachsubst</b>  value.  See the <b>attach</b> option for an explanation of
                     <u>string</u>.  If the null string (``<b>""</b>'') is used, no string will be printed.

              <b>detachsubst</b> <u>c</u><b>=</b><u>t</u>[<u>n</u>]<u>f</u>[<b>,</b>...]|<b>""</b>
                     Perform character substitutions on the <b>detach</b> value.  See the  <b>attachsubst</b>  option  for  an
                     explanation of the format string.

       A simple configuration to set a new default escape sequence and override the master location would be:

              # override options for all hosts
              config * {
                  master localhost;
                  escape ^Ee;
              }
              # set things more specific to host1
              # note: if the entries were reversed, host1
              # would also use localhost.
              config host1 {
                  master console1;
              }

</pre><h4><b>ESCAPE</b> <b>SEQUENCES</b></h4><pre>
       The  connection can be controlled by a two-character escape sequence, followed by a command.  The default
       escape sequence is ``control-E c'' (octal 005 143).  (The escape sequences are actually processed by  the
       server; see the <b><a href="../man8/conserver.8.html">conserver</a></b>(8) man page for more information.)  Commands are:

       <b>.</b>            disconnect
       <b>;</b>            move to another console
       <b>a</b>            attach read-write if nobody already is
       <b>b</b>            send broadcast message to all users on this console
       <b>c</b>            toggle flow control (don't do this)
       <b>d</b>            down the current console
       <b>e</b><u>cc</u>          change the escape sequence to the next two characters
       <b>f</b>            forcibly attach read-write
       <b>g</b>            group info
       <b>i</b>            information dump
       <b>L</b>            toggle logging on/off
       <b>l?</b>           list the break sequences available
       <b>l0</b>           send the break sequence associated with this console
       <b>l1-9a-z</b>      send the specific break sequence
       <b>m</b>            display the "message of the day"
       <b>o</b>            close (if open) and reopen the line (to clear errors (silo overflows)) and the log file
       <b>p</b>            playback the last 60 lines of output
       <b>P</b>            set number of playback lines
       <b>r</b>            replay the last 20 lines of output
       <b>R</b>            set number of replay lines
       <b>s</b>            switch to spy mode (read only)
       <b>u</b>            show status of hosts/users in this group
       <b>v</b>            show the version of the group server
       <b>w</b>            who is using this console
       <b>x</b>            examine this group's devices and modes
       <b>z</b>            suspend this connection
       <b>!</b>            invoke task
       <b>|</b>            attach a local command to the console
       <b>?</b>            display list of commands
       <b>^M</b> (return)  continue, ignore the escape sequence
       <b>^R</b> (ctrl-R)  replay the last line only
       <b>\</b><u>ooo</u>         send character having octal code <u>ooo</u> (must specify three octal digits)

       If  any  other  character is hit after the escape sequence, all three characters will be discarded.  Note
       that a line break or a down command can only be sent from a read-write connection.  To  send  the  escape
       sequence  through  the connection one must redefine the outer escape sequence, or use <b>^Ec\</b><u>ooo</u> to send the
       first escape character before typing the second character directly.

       In the <b>-u</b> output, the login  ``&lt;none&gt;''  indicates  no  one  is  viewing  that  console,  and  the  login
       ``&lt;spies&gt;'' indicates that no one has a read-write connection (only read-only).

       When  running  a local command via ``<b>^Ec|</b>'', you can type `<b>^C</b>' to send the command a SIGHUP, `<b>^\</b>' to send
       the command a SIGKILL, and `<b>o</b>' to toggle the display of the console data.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       console -u     Outputs something like:

                      dumb      up      &lt;none&gt;
                      expert    up      ksb@mentor
                      tyro      up      &lt;spies&gt;
                      mentor    up      &lt;none&gt;
                      sage      up      fine@cis

                      The <b>&lt;none&gt;</b> indicates no one is viewing <u>dumb</u> or <u>mentor</u>, the <b>&lt;spies&gt;</b>  indicates  only  read-
                      only  connections  exist  for  <u>tyro</u>,  and other <u>login</u>@<u>host</u> entries indicate users attached
                      read-write to <u>sage</u> and <u>expert</u>.

       console -w     Outputs something like:

                      ksb@extra       attach  2days     expert
                      file@cis        attach  21:46     sage
                      dmr@alice       spy      0:04     tyro

                      The third column is the idle time of the user.  Either <u>hours</u>:<u>minutes</u> or number of days  is
                      displayed.

       console -e "^[1" lv426
                      Requests  a  connection  to  the host ``lv426'' with the escape characters set to ``escape
                      one''.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The following default file locations may be overridden at compile time or  by  the  command-line  options
       described above.  Run <b>console</b> <b>-V</b> to see the defaults set at compile time.

       <b>/etc/console.cf</b>          system-wide configuration file
       <b>$HOME/.consolerc</b>         per-user configuration file

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       It is possible to create a loop of console connections, with ugly results.  Never run <b>console</b> from within
       a console connection (unless you set each escape sequence differently).

       The  -i  output  can  produce  more  than the stated number of fields of information if the user-provided
       information has embedded colons.

       I'm sure there are more, I just don't know where they are.  Please let me know if you find any.
