       tkcon - Tk console replacement

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tkcon</b> [{<u>option</u> <u>value</u> | <u>tcl_script</u>} ...]

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       TkCon  is  a  replacement  for the standard console that comes with Tk (on Windows/Mac, but also works on
       Unix).  The console itself provides many more features than the standard console.   TkCon  works  on  all
       platforms  where  Tcl/Tk  is  available.   It  is meant primarily to aid one when working with the little
       details inside Tcl and Tk, giving Unix users the GUI console provided by default in the Mac  and  Windows
       Tk.

       <b>tkcon</b> [{<u>option</u> <u>value</u> | <u>tcl_script</u>} ...]

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Except  for  <b>-rcfile</b>,  command  line  arguments are handled after the TkCon resource file is sourced, but
       before the slave interpreter or the TkCon user interface is initialized.

       <b>-rcfile</b> is handled right before it would be sourced, allowing you to specify any alternate file.  Command
       line arguments are passed to each new console and will be  evaluated  by  each.   To  prevent  this  from
       happening, you have to say

              tkcon main set argv {}; tkcon main set argc 0

       For these options, any unique substring is allowed.

       <b>-argv</b> (also <b>--</b>)
              Causes  TkCon  to  stop  evaluating  arguments and set the remaining args to be argv/argc (with <b>--</b>
              prepended).  This carries over for any further consoles.  This is meant only  for  wrapping  TkCon
              around programs that require their own arguments.

       <b>-color-&lt;color&gt;</b> <u>color</u>
              Sets the requested color type to the specified color for tkcon.  See <b><a href="../man5/tkconrc.5.html">tkconrc</a></b>(5) for the recognized
              <b>&lt;color&gt;</b> names.

       <b>-eval</b> <u>tcl_script</u> (also <b>-main</b> or <b>-e</b>)
              A  Tcl  script  to  eval  in  each main interpreter.  This is evaluated after the resource file is
              loaded and the slave interpreter is created.  Multiple  <b>-eval</b>  switches  will  be  recognized  (in
              order).

       <b>-exec</b> <u>slavename</u>
              Sets  the  named  slave  that  tkcon  operates  in.   In general, this is only useful to set to <u>""</u>
              (empty), indicating to tkcon to  avoid  the  multi-interpreter  model  and  operate  in  the  main
              environment.   When  this  is  empty,  any  further arguments will be only used in the first tkcon
              console and not passed onto further new consoles.  This is useful when using tkcon  as  a  console
              for extended wish executables that don't load there commands into slave interpreters.

       <b>-font</b> <u>font</u>
              Sets  the font that tkcon uses for its text windows.  If this isn't a fixed width font, tkcon will
              override it.

       <b>-nontcl</b> <u>TCL_BOOLEAN</u>
              Sets <b>::tkcon::OPT(nontcl)</b> to <u>TCL_BOOLEAN</u> (see  <b><a href="../man5/tkconrc.5.html">tkconrc</a></b>(5)).   Needed  when  attaching  to  non-Tcl
              interpreters.

       <b>-package</b> <u>package_name</u> (also <b>-load</b>)
              Packages to automatically load into the slave interpreters (i.e. "Tk").

       <b>-rcfile</b> <u>filename</u>
              Specify an alternate tkcon resource file name.

       <b>-root</b> <u>widgetname</u>
              Makes the named widget the root name of all consoles (i.e. .tkcon).

       <b>-slave</b> <u>tcl_script</u>
              A  Tcl  script to eval in each slave interpreter.  This will append the one specified in the tkcon
              resource file, if any.

</pre><h4><b>KEY</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Most of the bindings are the same as for the <b>text</b> widget.  Some have been modified to make sure that  the
       integrity of the console is maintained.  Others have been added to enhance the usefulness of the console.
       Only the modified or new bindings are listed here.

       <b>Control-x</b> or <b>Cut</b> (on Sparc5 keyboards)
              Cut.

       <b>Control-c</b> or <b>Copy</b> (on Sparc5 keyboards)
              Copy.

       <b>Control-v</b> or <b>Paste</b> (on Sparc5 keyboards)
              Paste.

       <b>Insert</b> Insert (duh).

       <b>Up</b>     Goes  up  one  level  in the commands line history when cursor is on the prompt line, otherwise it
              moves through the buffer.

       <b>Down</b>   Goes down one level in the commands line history when cursor is on the last line  of  the  buffer,
              otherwise it moves through the buffer.

       <b>Control-p</b>
              Goes up one level in the commands line history.

       <b>Control-n</b>
              Goes down one level in the commands line history.

       <b>Tab</b>    Tries to expand file path names, then variable names, then proc names.

       <b>Escape</b> Tries to expand file path names.

       <b>Control-P</b>
              Tries  to  expand  procedure  names.   The  procedure names will be those that are actually in the
              attached interpreter (unless nontcl is specified, in which case it always does the lookup  in  the
              default slave interpreter).

       <b>Control-V</b>
              Tries to expand variable names (those returned by [info vars]).  It's search behavior is like that
              for procedure names.

       <b>Return</b> or <b>Enter</b>
              Evaluates  the  current  command line if it is a complete command, otherwise it just goes to a new
              line.

       <b>Control-a</b>
              Go to the beginning of the current command line.

       <b>Control-l</b>
              Clear the entire console buffer.

       <b>Control-r</b>
              Searches backwards in the history for any command that contains the string in the current  command
              line.   Repeatable  to  search  farther  back.   The matching substring off the found command will
              blink.

       <b>Control-s</b>
              As above, but searches forward (only useful if you searched too far back).

       <b>Control-t</b>
              Transposes characters.

       <b>Control-u</b>
              Clears the current command line.

       <b>Control-z</b>
              Saves current command line in a buffer that can be  retrieved  with  another  <b>Control-z</b>.   If  the
              current  command  line  is  empty,  then any saved command is retrieved without being overwritten,
              otherwise the current contents get swapped with what's in the saved command buffer.

       <b>Control-Key-1</b>
              Attaches console to the console's slave interpreter.

       <b>Control-Key-2</b>
              Attaches console to the console's master interpreter.

       <b>Control-Key-3</b>
              Attaches console to main TkCon interpreter.

       <b>Control-A</b>
              Pops up the "About" dialog.

       <b>Control-N</b>
              Creates a new console. Each console has separate state, including it's own widget hierarchy  (it's
              a slave interpreter).

       <b>Control-q</b>
              Close the current console OR Quit the program (depends on the value of <b>::tkcon::TKCON(slaveexit)</b>).

       <b>Control-w</b>
              Closes  the  current  console.   Closing  the main console will exit the program (something has to
              control all the slaves...).

       TkCon also has electric bracing (similar to that in emacs).  It will highlight matching  pairs  of  {}'s,
       []'s,  ()'s  and  ""'s.  For the first three, if there is no matching left element for the right, then it
       blinks the entire current command line.  For the double quote, if there is no proper match then  it  just
       blinks  the  current  double  quote  character.  It does properly recognize most escaping (except escaped
       escapes), but does not look for commenting (why would you interactively put comments in?).

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       There are several new procedures introduced in TkCon to improve  productivity  and/or  account  for  lost
       functionality  in the Tcl environment that users are used to in native environments.  There are also some
       redefined procedures.  Here is a non-comprehensive list:

       <b>alias</b> ?<u>sourceCmd</u> <u>targetCmd</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> ...??
              Simple alias mechanism.  It will overwrite  existing  commands.   When  called  without  args,  it
              returns  current  aliases.   Note that TkCon makes some aliases for you (in slaves).  Don't delete
              those.

       <b>clear</b> ?<u>percentage</u>?
              Clears the text widget.  Same as the &lt;<b>Control-l</b>&gt; binding, except this will accept a percentage  of
              the buffer to clear (1-100, 100 default).

       <b>dir</b> ?<u>-all</u>? ?<u>-full</u>? ?<u>-long</u>? ?<u>pattern</u> <u>pattern</u> ...?
              Cheap way to get directory listings.  Uses glob style pattern matching.

       <b>dump</b> <u>type</u> ?<u>-nocomplain</u>? ?<u>-filter</u> <u>pattern</u>? ?<b>--</b>? <u>pattern</u> ?<u>pattern</u> ...?
              The  dump  command provides a way for the user to spit out state information about the interpreter
              in a Tcl readable (and human readable) form.  See <b><a href="../man3tk/dump.3tk.html">dump</a></b>(3tk) for details.

       <b>echo</b> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> ...?
              Concatenates the args and spits the result to the console (stdout).

       <b>edit</b> ?<u>-type</u> <u>type</u>? ?<u>-find</u> <u>str</u>? ?<u>-attach</u> <u>interp</u>? <u>arg</u>
              Opens an editor with the data from arg.  The optional type argument can be one of:  <u>proc</u>,  <u>var</u>  or
              <u>file</u>.  For proc or var, the arg may be a pattern.

       <b>idebug</b> <u>command</u> ?<u>args</u>?
              Interactive debugging command.  See <b><a href="../man3tk/idebug.3tk.html">idebug</a></b>(3tk) for details.

       <b>lremove</b> ?<u>-all</u>? ?<u>-regexp</u> <u>-glob</u>? <u>list</u> <u>items</u>
              Removes  one or more items from a list and returns the new list.  If <u>-all</u> is specified, it removes
              all instances of each item in the list.  If <u>-regexp</u> or <u>-glob</u> is specified, it interprets each item
              in the items list as a regexp or glob pattern to match against.

       <b>less</b>   Aliased to <b>edit</b>.

       <b>ls</b>     Aliased to <b>dir</b> <u>-full</u>.

       <b>more</b>   Aliased to <b>edit</b>.

       <b>observe</b> <u>type</u> ?<u>args</u>?
              This  command  provides  passive  runtime  debugging  output  for  variables  and  commands.   See
              <b><a href="../man3tk/observe.3tk.html">observe</a></b>(3tk) for details.

       <b>puts</b> (same options as always)
              Redefined to put the output into TkCon.

       <b>tkcon</b> <u>method</u> ?<u>args</u>?
              Multi-purpose command.  See <b><a href="../man3tk/tkcon.3tk.html">tkcon</a></b>(3tk) for details.

       <b>tclindex</b> <u>?-extensions</u> <u>patternlist?</u> <u>?-index</u> <u>TCL_BOOLEAN?</u> <u>?-package</u> <u>TCL_BOOLEAN?</u> <u>?dir1</u> <u>dir2</u> <u>...?</u>
              Convenience  proc  to  update  the  "<u>tclIndex</u>" (controlled by <u>-index</u> switch) and/or "<u>pkgIndex.tcl</u>"
              (controlled by <u>-package</u> switch) file in the named directories  based  on  the  given  pattern  for
              files.  It defaults to creating the "<u>tclIndex</u>" but not the "<u>pkgIndex.tcl</u>" file, with the directory
              defaulting  to [pwd].  The extension defaults to *.tcl, with *.[info sharelibextension] added when
              <u>-package</u> is true.

       <b>unalias</b> <u>cmd</u>
              unaliases command.

       <b>what</b> <u>string</u>
              The what command will identify the word given in string in the Tcl environment and return  a  list
              of  types  that  it  was  recognized  as.   Possible  types  are: alias, procedure, command, array
              variable, scalar variable, directory, file, widget, and executable.  Used by procedures  dump  and
              which.

       <b>which</b> <u>command</u>
              Like the <b>which</b> command of Unix shells, this will tell you if a particular command is known, and if
              so, whether it is internal or external to the interpreter.  If it is an internal command and there
              is  a  slot in <b>auto_index</b> for it, it tells you the file that <b>auto_index</b> would load.  This does not
              necessarily mean that that is where the file came from, but if it  were  not  in  the  interpreter
              previously, then that is where the command was found.

       There  are  several  procedures  that  I  use as helpers that some may find helpful in there coding (i.e.
       expanding pathnames). Feel free to lift them from the code (but do assign proper attribution).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMLPES</b></h4><pre>
       Some examples of tkcon command line startup situations:

              <b>megawish</b> /usr/bin/tkcon <b>-exec</b> "" <b>-root</b> .tkcon <u>mainfile.tcl</u>

       Use tkcon as a console for your <b>megawish</b> application.  You can avoid starting the line with  megawish  if
       that  is  the default <b>wish</b> that TkCon would use.  The <b>-root</b> ensures that tkcon will not conflict with the
       application root window.

              <b>tkcon</b> <b>-font</b> "Courier 12" <b>-load</b> Tk

       Use the courier font for TkCon and always load Tk in slave interpreters at startup.

              <b>tkcon</b> <b>-rcfile</b> <a href="file:~/.wishrc">~/.wishrc</a> <b>-color-bg</b> white

       Use the <a href="file:~/.wishrc">~/.wishrc</a> file as the resource file, and a white background for TkCon's text widgets.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       TkCon will search for a resource file in "<u><a href="file:~/.tkconrc">~/.tkconrc</a></u>".  TkCon never sources the  "<u><a href="file:~/.wishrc">~/.wishrc</a></u>"  file.   The
       resource  file  is  sourced by each new instance of the console.  An example resource file is provided in
       <b><a href="../man5/tkconrc.5.html">tkconrc</a></b>(5).
