</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gvb - simulate 1 and 2-dimensional vibrations in a nice GUI

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gvb</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the <b>gvb</b> command.

       <b>gvb</b>  is  a  program  that  lets  the  user  simulate  waves and vibrations with given starting positions,
       calculation method and graphical appearance.
       It's easy to get the GUI nearly stuck if started with too much points; the  maximum  of  points  that  an
       average  computer  can  manage while remaining responsive is probably about 200. An exception is given by
       the fact that if you are dumping frames to create an animation, probably you  want  a  good  quality  and
       won't mind if the GUI is almost stuck.
       Also  pay  attention  to  the  fact  that  the "eig" mode requires a lot of precalculation; in this mode,
       calculating in 2 dimensions with just 15 points per dimension can already require some minutes, depending
       on CPU power.
