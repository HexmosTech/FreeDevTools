</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mssstest - Normalisationo of disease scores - originally developed for the EDSS for Multiple Sclerosis

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mssstest</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Suppose  one is interested in determining whether the genotype at some locus of interest affects the rate
       of progression of disease of people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). One method would be  to  calculate  the
       mean EDSS score in patients with each of the genotypes and test whether they are significantly different.
       However,  this  approach  is  inefficient  if patients have their EDSS assessed at different durations of
       disease, as patients who have had MS longer  typically  have  higher  EDSS  scores  regardless  of  their
       genotype. By adjusting for duration, a more powerful test can be developed.
       MSSStest  is  a  program  for  implementing  the  method  described in the article The Multiple Sclerosis
       Severity Score. R. Roxburgh S. Seaman et al. (2004), accepted for publication by Neurology. It calculates
       MSSS scores and uses these scores to test for differences between disease progression rates in  different
       groups defined by genotype at some locus.
       To  use  the program first copy the table of disease scores to the current directory. You are expected to
       use the EDSS scores provided by the authors.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The program does not accept options, it should, though. The output  goes  to  the  files  "msss.out"  and
       "indivmsss.out".
