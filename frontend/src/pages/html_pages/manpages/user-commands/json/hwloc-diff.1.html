</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       hwloc-diff - Compute differences between two XML topologies

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hwloc-diff</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>&lt;input1.xml&gt;</u> <u>&lt;input2.xml&gt;</u>

       <b>hwloc-diff</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>&lt;input1.xml&gt;</u> <u>&lt;input2.xml&gt;</u> <u>&lt;output.xml&gt;</u>

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--refname</b> &lt;name&gt;
                 Use  &lt;name&gt;  as  the identifier for the reference topology in the output XML difference.  It is
                 meant to tell which topology should be used when applying  the  resulting  difference.   hwloc-
                 patch may use that name to automatically load the relevant reference topology XML.  By default,
                 &lt;input1.xml&gt; is used without its full path.

       <b>--version</b> Report version and exit.

       <b>-h</b> <b>--help</b> Display help message and exit.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       hwloc-diff  computes the difference between two XML topologies and stores the result into &lt;output.xml&gt; if
       any, or dumps it to stdout otherwise.

       The output difference may later be applied to another topology with hwloc-patch.

       hwloc-compress-dir may be used for computing the diffs between all XML files in a directory.

       <b>NOTE:</b> If some application-specific userdata were been exported to the input XMLs, they  will  be  ignored
       and discarded from the output because hwloc has no way to understand and compare them.

       <b>NOTE:</b>  It  is  highly  recommended that you read the <a href="../man7/hwloc.7.html">hwloc</a>(7) overview page before reading this man page.
       Most of the concepts described in <a href="../man7/hwloc.7.html">hwloc</a>(7) directly apply to the hwloc-diff utility.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       hwloc-diff's operation is best described through several examples.

       Compute the difference between two XML topologies and output it to stdout:

           $ hwloc-diff fourmi023.xml fourmi024.xml
           Found 11 differences, exporting to stdout
           &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
           ...

       Output the difference to file diff.xml instead:

           $ hwloc-diff fourmi023.xml fourmi024.xml diff.xml
           Found 11 differences, exporting to diff.xml

       When the difference is too complex to be represented:

           $ hwloc-diff fourmi023.xml avakas-frontend1.xml
           Found 1 differences, including 1 too complex ones.
           Cannot export differences to stdout

       Directly compute the difference between two topologies and apply it to another one:

           $ hwloc-diff fourmi023.xml fourmi024.xml | hwloc-patch fourmi025.xml -

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful execution, hwloc-diff outputs the difference.  The return value is 0.

       If the difference is too complex to be represented, an error is returned and the output is not generated.

       hwloc-diff also returns nonzero if any kind of error occurs, such as (but  not  limited  to)  failure  to
       parse the command line.
