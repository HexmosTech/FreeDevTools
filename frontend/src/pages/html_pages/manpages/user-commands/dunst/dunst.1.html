</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dunst - A customizable and lightweight notification-daemon

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       dunst [-conf file] [-verbosity v] [-print] [--startup_notification]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Dunst is a highly configurable and lightweight notification daemon.

   <b>Autostarting</b> <b>dunst</b>
       On most installations, dunst should be able to automatically be started by D-Bus when a notification is
       sent. This is not recommended when multiple notification daemons are installed, because D-Bus will not
       know which one to start.  Other ways of autostarting dunst include starting dunst with your desktop
       environment or window manager's autostart functionality or via the provided systemd service.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h/-help/--help</b>
           List all command line flags

       <b>-conf/-config</b> <b>file</b>
           Use  alternative  config  file.   This  disables  the search for other config files.  If it cannot be
           opened, dunst will issue a warning and fall back on its internal defaults.   (Hint:  `dunst  -conf  -
           &lt;/dev/null` can be used to enforce the defaults, i.e. for testing)

       <b>-v/-version/--version</b>
           Print version information.

       <b>-verbosity</b> (values: 'crit', 'warn', 'mesg', 'info', 'debug' default 'mesg')
           Do  not display log messages, which have lower precedence than specified verbosity. This won't affect
           printing notifications on the terminal. Use the '-print' option for this.

       <b>-print/--print</b>
           Print notifications to stdout. This might be useful for logging, setting up rules or using the output
           in other scripts.

       <b>-startup_notification/--startup_notification</b>
           Display a notification on startup.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       A default configuration file is  included  (usually  /etc/xdg/dunst/dunstrc)  and  serves  as  the  least
       important  configuration file. Note: this was previously /usr/share/dunst/dunstrc. You can edit this file
       to change the system-wide defaults or copy it to a more important location to override its settings.  See
       the  FILES  section for more details on where dunst searches for its configuration files and how settings
       get applied.

       See <b><a href="../man5/dunst.5.html">dunst</a></b>(5) for all possible settings.

   <b>NOTIFY-SEND</b>
       dunst is able to get different colors for a message via notify-send.  In order to do that you have to add
       a hint via the -h option.  The progress value can be set with a hint, too.

       notify-send -h string:fgcolor:#ff4444
       notify-send -h string:bgcolor:#4444ff -h string:fgcolor:#ff4444 -h string:frcolor:#44ff44
       notify-send -h int:value:42 "Working ..."

</pre><h4><b>MISCELLANEOUS</b></h4><pre>
       Dunst can be paused via the `dunstctl set-paused true` command. To unpause dunst use `dunstctl set-paused
       false`.  Another way is to send SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 to pause  and  unpause  respectively.  Pausing  using
       dunstctl  is  recommended  over  using signals, because the meaning of the signals isn't stable and might
       change in the future.

       When paused, dunst won't display any notifications, but keeps all notifications in a queue. This can  for
       example  be wrapped around a screen locker (i3lock, slock) to prevent flickering of notifications through
       the lock, and to read all missed notifications after returning to the computer.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       These are the base directories dunst searches for configuration files in <u>descending</u> <u>order</u> <u>of</u> <u>importance</u>:

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME
               This is the most important directory. ("$HOME/.config" if unset or empty)

       $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS
               This, like $PATH for instance, is a :-separated list of base directories in <u>descending</u>  <u>order</u>  <u>of</u>
               <u>importance</u>.  (<u><a href="file:/etc/xdg">/etc/xdg</a></u> if unset or empty)

       Dunst will search these directories for the following relative file paths:

       <u>dunst/dunstrc</u>
               This is the base config and as such the least important in a particular base directory.

       <u>dunst/dunstrc.d/*.conf</u>
               These  are  "drop-ins" (mind the ".d" suffix of the directory).  They are more important than the
               base dunstrc in the parent directory, as they are considered to be  small  snippets  to  override
               settings.   The  last  in  lexical  order is the most important one, so you can easily change the
               order by renaming them.  A common approach to naming drop-ins is to  prefix  them  with  numbers,
               i.e.:

                   00-least-important.conf
                   01-foo.conf
                   20-bar.conf
                   99-most-important.conf

               Only files with the <b>.conf</b> suffix will be read.

       Only settings from the last base config the corresponding drop-ins get applied.  So if a dunstrc is first
       found  in  <u><a href="file:~/.config/dunst/dunstrc">~/.config/dunst/dunstrc</a></u>, drop-ins will be searched in <u><a href="file:~/.config/dunst/dunstrc.d/">~/.config/dunst/dunstrc.d/</a>*</u>. Settings in
       more important files override those in less important ones.
