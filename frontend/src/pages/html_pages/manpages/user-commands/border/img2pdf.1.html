       Losslessly convert raster images to PDF without re-encoding PNG, JPEG, and JPEG2000 images. This leads to
       a  lossless conversion of PNG, JPEG and JPEG2000 images with the only added file size coming from the PDF
       container itself.  Other raster graphics formats are losslessly stored using the same encoding  that  PNG
       uses.   For  images  with transparency, the alpha channel will be stored as a separate soft mask. This is
       lossless, too.

       The output is sent to standard output so that it can be redirected into a file or to another  program  as
       part of a shell pipe. To directly write the output into a file, use the <b>-o</b> or <b>--output</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>positional</b> <b>arguments:</b>
       infile Specifies the input file(s) in any format that can be read by the Python Imaging Library (PIL). If
              no  input  images are given, then a single image is read from standard input. The special filename
              "-" can be used once to read an image from standard input. To read a file in the current directory
              with the filename "-" (or with a filename starting with "-"), pass it  to  img2pdf  by  explicitly
              stating its relative path like "./-". Cannot be used together with <b>--from-file</b>.

   <b>options:</b>
       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              show this help message and exit

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Makes the program operate in verbose mode, printing messages on standard error.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Prints version information and exits.

       <b>--from-file</b> FILE
              Read  the list of images from FILE instead of passing them as positional arguments. If this option
              is used, then the list of positional arguments must be empty.  The paths to the  input  images  in
              FILE  are  separated  by  NUL bytes. If FILE is "-" then the paths are expected on standard input.
              This option is useful if you want to pass more images than the  maximum  command  length  of  your
              shell permits. This option can be used with commands like `find <b>-print0</b>`.

   <b>General</b> <b>output</b> <b>arguments:</b>
              Arguments controlling the output format.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--output</b> out
              Makes the program output to a file instead of standard output.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--colorspace</b> colorspace
              Forces  the  PIL  colorspace.  See  the  epilogue  for  a list of possible values. Usually the PDF
              colorspace would be derived from the color space of the input image.  This option  overwrites  the
              automatically detected colorspace from the input image and thus forces a certain colorspace in the
              output  PDF  <u>/ColorSpace</u> property. This is useful for JPEG 2000 images with a different colorspace
              than RGB.

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--nodate</b>
              Suppresses timestamps in the output and thus makes the  output  deterministic  between  individual
              runs. You can also manually set a date using the <b>--moddate</b> and <b>--creationdate</b> options.

       <b>--engine</b> engine
              Choose  PDF  engine.  Can  be either internal, pikepdf or pdfrw. The internal engine does not have
              additional requirements and writes out a human readable  PDF.  The  pikepdf  engine  requires  the
              pikepdf  Python  module and qpdf library, is most featureful, can linearize PDFs ("fast web view")
              and can compress more parts of it.The pdfrw engine requires the pdfrw Python module but  does  not
              support  unicode  metadata  (See  https://github.com/pmaupin/pdfrw/issues/39) or palette data (See
              https://github.com/pmaupin/pdfrw/issues/128).

       <b>--first-frame-only</b>
              By default, img2pdf will convert multi-frame images like multi-page TIFF or animated GIF images to
              one page per frame. This option will only let the first frame of every multi-frame input image  be
              converted into a page in the resulting PDF.

       <b>--include-thumbnails</b>
              Some  multi-frame  formats  like  MPO carry a main image and one or more scaled-down copies of the
              main image (thumbnails). In such a case, img2pdf will only include the main image and  not  create
              additional  pages  for  each of the thumbnails. If this option is set, img2pdf will instead create
              one page per frame and thus store each thumbnail on its own page.

       <b>--pillow-limit-break</b>
              img2pdf uses the Python Imaging Library Pillow to read input images.  Pillow  limits  the  maximum
              input  image  size  to 89478485 pixels to prevent decompression bomb denial of service attacks. If
              your input image contains more pixels than that, use this option to disable  this  safety  measure
              during this run of img2pdf

       <b>--pdfa</b> [PDFA]
              Output    a    PDF/A-1b    compliant    document.    By    default,   this   will   embed   either
              <u>/usr/share/color/icc/sRGB.icc</u>,              <u>/usr/share/color/icc/OpenICC/sRGB.icc</u>               or
              <u>/usr/share/color/icc/colord/sRGB.icc</u> as the color profile, whichever is found to exist first.

   <b>Image</b> <b>and</b> <b>page</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>layout</b> <b>arguments:</b>
              Every input image will be placed on its own page. The image size is controlled by the dpi value of
              the input image or, if unset or missing, the default dpi of 96.00. By default, each page will have
              the  same size as the image it shows.  Thus, there will be no visible border between the image and
              the page border by default. If image size and page size are made different from each other by  the
              options in this section, the image will always be centered in both dimensions.

              The  image  size  and  page size can be explicitly set using the <b>--imgsize</b> and <b>--pagesize</b> options,
              respectively.  If either dimension of the image size is specified but the same  dimension  of  the
              page  size  is  not,  then  the  latter  will be derived from the former using an optional minimal
              distance between the image and the page border (given by the <b>--border</b>  option)  and/or  a  certain
              fitting strategy (given by the <b>--fit</b> option). The converse happens if a dimension of the page size
              is set but the same dimension of the image size is not.

              Any  length value in below options is represented by the meta variable L which is a floating point
              value with an optional unit appended (without a space between them). The default unit is pt  (1/72
              inch, the PDF unit) and other allowed units are cm (centimeter), mm (millimeter), and in (inch).

              Any  size  argument  of  the  format  LxL in the options below specifies the width and height of a
              rectangle where the first L represents the width and the second L represents the  height  with  an
              optional  unit following each value as described above.  Either width or height may be omitted. If
              the height is omitted, the separating x can be omitted as well. Omitting  the  width  requires  to
              prefix the height with the separating x. The missing dimension will be chosen so to not change the
              image  aspect  ratio. Instead of giving the width and height explicitly, you may also specify some
              (case-insensitive) common page sizes such as letter and A4.  See the epilogue at the bottom for  a
              complete list of the valid sizes.

              The  <b>--fit</b>  option  scales  to  fit  the  image  into  a rectangle that is either derived from the
              <b>--imgsize</b> option or otherwise from the <b>--pagesize</b> option.  If the  <b>--border</b>  option  is  given  in
              addition to the <b>--imgsize</b> option while the <b>--pagesize</b> option is not given, then the page size will
              be  calculated from the image size, respecting the border setting. If the <b>--border</b> option is given
              in addition to the <b>--pagesize</b> option while the <b>--imgsize</b> option is not given, then the image  size
              will  be  calculated  from the page size, respecting the border setting. If the <b>--border</b> option is
              given while both the <b>--pagesize</b> and <b>--imgsize</b> options are passed, then the <b>--border</b> option will be
              ignored.

              The <b>--pagesize</b> option or the <b>--imgsize</b> option with the <b>--border</b> option will determine the MediaBox
              size of the resulting PDF document.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--pagesize</b> LxL
              Sets the size of the PDF pages. The short-option is the upper case S because it is an mnemonic for
              being bigger than the image size.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--imgsize</b> LxL
              Sets the size of the images on the PDF pages. In addition, the unit dpi is allowed which will  set
              the  image  size  as a value of dots per inch. Instead of a unit, width and height values may also
              have a percentage sign appended, indicating  a  resize  of  the  image  by  that  percentage.  The
              short-option is the lower case s because it is an mnemonic for being smaller than the page size.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--border</b> L[:L]
              Specifies  the  minimal  distance  between the image border and the PDF page border. This value Is
              overwritten by explicit values set by <b>--pagesize</b>  or  <b>--imgsize</b>.  The  value  will  be  used  when
              calculating  page  dimensions from the image dimensions or the other way round. One, or two length
              values can be given as an argument, separated by a colon. One value specifies the  minimal  border
              on  all  four  sides.  Two  values  specify  the  minimal border on the top/bottom and left/right,
              respectively. It is not possible to specify asymmetric  borders  because  images  will  always  be
              centered on the page.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--fit</b> FIT
              If  <b>--imgsize</b>  is  given, fits the image using these dimensions. Otherwise, fit the image into the
              dimensions given by <b>--pagesize</b>. FIT is one of into, fill, exact, shrink and enlarge.  The  default
              value is "into". See the epilogue at the bottom for a description of the FIT options.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--auto-orient</b>
              If both dimensions of the page are given via <b>--pagesize</b>, conditionally swaps these dimensions such
              that the page orientation is the same as the orientation of the input image. If the orientation of
              a page gets flipped, then so do the values set via the <b>--border</b> option.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--rotation</b>, <b>--orientation</b> ROT
              Specifies  how  input  images should be rotated. ROT can be one of auto, none, ifvalid, 0, 90, 180
              and 270. The default value is auto and indicates that input images are rotated according to  their
              EXIF  Orientation  tag.   The  values  none  and 0 ignore the EXIF Orientation values of the input
              images. The value ifvalid acts like auto but ignores invalid EXIF rotation values and only  issues
              a  warning instead of throwing an error.  This is useful because many devices like Android phones,
              Canon cameras or scanners emit an invalid Orientation tag value of zero. The values  90,  180  and
              270 perform a clockwise rotation of the image.

       <b>--crop-border</b> L[:L]
              Specifies  the border between the CropBox and the MediaBox. One, or two length values can be given
              as an argument, separated by a colon. One value specifies the border on all four sides. Two values
              specify the border on the top/bottom and left/right, respectively.  It is not possible to  specify
              asymmetric borders.

       <b>--bleed-border</b> L[:L]
              Specifies the border between the BleedBox and the MediaBox. One, or two length values can be given
              as an argument, separated by a colon. One value specifies the border on all four sides. Two values
              specify  the border on the top/bottom and left/right, respectively.  It is not possible to specify
              asymmetric borders.

       <b>--trim-border</b> L[:L]
              Specifies the border between the TrimBox and the MediaBox. One, or two length values can be  given
              as an argument, separated by a colon. One value specifies the border on all four sides. Two values
              specify  the border on the top/bottom and left/right, respectively.  It is not possible to specify
              asymmetric borders.

       <b>--art-border</b> L[:L]
              Specifies the border between the ArtBox and the MediaBox. One, or two length values can  be  given
              as an argument, separated by a colon. One value specifies the border on all four sides. Two values
              specify  the border on the top/bottom and left/right, respectively.  It is not possible to specify
              asymmetric borders.

              understood by `date <b>--date</b>`

       <b>--subject</b> subject
              Sets the subject metadata value

       <b>--keywords</b> kw [kw ...]
              Sets the keywords metadata value (can be given multiple times)

   <b>PDF</b> <b>viewer</b> <b>arguments:</b>
              PDF files can specify how they are meant to be presented to the user by a PDF viewer

       <b>--viewer-panes</b> PANES
              Instruct the PDF viewer which side panes to show.  Valid values are "outlines" and "thumbs". It is
              not possible to specify both at the same time.

       <b>--viewer-initial-page</b> NUM
              Instead of showing the first page, instruct the PDF viewer to show the given  page  instead.  Page
              numbers start with 1.

       <b>--viewer-magnification</b> MAG
              Instruct  the  PDF  viewer  to  open  the PDF with a certain zoom level. Valid values are either a
              floating point number giving the exact zoom level, "fit" (zoom to fit whole page), "fith" (zoom to
              fit page width) and "fitbh" (zoom to fit visible page width).

       <b>--viewer-page-layout</b> LAYOUT
              Instruct the PDF viewer how to arrange the pages on the screen. Valid values are "single" (display
              single pages), "onecolumn" (one continuous column), "twocolumnright" (two continuous columns  with
              odd number pages on the right) and "twocolumnleft" (two continuous columns with odd numbered pages
              on  the  left),  "twopageright"  (two pages with odd numbered page on the right) and "twopageleft"
              (two pages with odd numbered page on the left)

       <b>--viewer-fit-window</b>
              Instruct the PDF viewer to resize the window to fit the page size

       <b>--viewer-center-window</b>
              Instruct the PDF viewer to center the PDF viewer window

       <b>--viewer-fullscreen</b>
              Instruct the PDF viewer to open the PDF in fullscreen mode

   <b>Colorspace:</b>
              Currently, the colorspace must be forced for JPEG 2000 images that are not in the RGB  colorspace.
              Available colorspace options are based on Python Imaging Library (PIL) short handles.

       RGB    RGB color

       L      Grayscale

       1      Black and white (internally converted to grayscale)

       CMYK   CMYK color

       CMYK;I CMYK color with inversion (for CMYK JPEG files from Adobe)

   <b>Paper</b> <b>sizes:</b>
              You  can  specify  the short hand paper size names shown in the first column in the table below as
              arguments to the <b>--pagesize</b> and <b>--imgsize</b> options.  The width and height they are  mapping  to  is
              shown  in  the second column.  Giving the value in the second column has the same effect as giving
              the short hand in the first column. Appending ^T (a caret/circumflex followed  by  the  letter  T)
              turns the paper size from portrait into landscape. The postfix thus symbolizes the transpose. Note
              that on Windows cmd.exe the caret symbol is the escape character, so you need to put quotes around
              the option value.  The values are case insensitive.

   <b>Fit</b> <b>options:</b>
              The  img2pdf  options for the <b>--fit</b> argument are shown in the first column in the table below. The
              function of these options can be mapped to the geometry operators of imagemagick.  For  users  who
              are  familiar  with  imagemagick,  the  corresponding operator is shown in the second column.  The
              third column shows whether or not the aspect ratio is  preserved  for  that  option  (same  as  in
              imagemagick).  Just  like  imagemagick, img2pdf tries hard to preserve the aspect ratio, so if the
              <b>--fit</b> argument is not given, then the default is "into" which corresponds to the  absence  of  any
              operator in imagemagick.  The value of the <b>--fit</b> option is case insensitive.

       into   |   | Y | The default. Width and height values specify maximum |   |   | values.

       <b>---------</b>+---+---+----------------------------------------------------------

       fill   | ^ | Y | Width and height values specify the minimum values.

       <b>---------</b>+---+---+----------------------------------------------------------

       exact  | ! | N | Width and height emphatically given.

       <b>---------</b>+---+---+----------------------------------------------------------

       shrink
              |  &gt;  |  Y  | Shrinks an image with dimensions larger than the given |   |   | ones (and otherwise
              behaves like "into").

       <b>---------</b>+---+---+----------------------------------------------------------

              enlarge | &lt; | Y | Enlarges an image with dimensions smaller than the given

       |      |   | ones (and otherwise behaves like "into").

   <b>Argument</b> <b>parsing:</b>
              Argument long options can be abbreviated to a prefix if the abbreviation is unambiguous. That  is,
              the prefix must match a unique option.

              Beware of your shell interpreting argument values as special characters (like the semicolon in the
              CMYK;I colorspace option). If in doubt, put the argument values in single quotes.

              If  you  want  an argument value to start with one or more minus characters, you must use the long
              option name and join them with an equal sign like so:


              $ img2pdf --author=--test--
              If your input file name starts with one or more minus characters, either separate the input  files
              from the other arguments by two minus signs:

              $ img2pdf -- --my-file-starts-with-two-minuses.jpg

              Or be more explicit about its relative path by prepending a ./:

              $ img2pdf ./--my-file-starts-with-two-minuses.jpg

              The order of non-positional arguments (all arguments other than the input images) does not matter.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
              Lines  starting  with  a  dollar sign denote commands you can enter into your terminal. The dollar
              sign signifies your command prompt. It is not part of the command you type.

              Convert two scans in JPEG format to a PDF document.

              $ img2pdf --output out.pdf page1.jpg page2.jpg

              Use a custom dpi value for the input images:

              $ img2pdf --output out.pdf --imgsize 300dpi page1.jpg page2.jpg

              Convert a directory of JPEG images into a PDF with printable A4 pages in landscape mode.  On  each
              page,  the  photo  takes the maximum amount of space while preserving its aspect ratio and a print
              border of 2 cm on the top and bottom and 2.5 cm on the left and right hand side.

              $ img2pdf --output out.pdf --pagesize "A4^T" --border 2cm:2.5cm *.jpg

              On each A4 page, fit images into a 10 cm times 15 cm rectangle but keep the original image size if
              the image is smaller than that.

              $ img2pdf --output out.pdf -S A4 --imgsize 10cmx15cm --fit shrink *.jpg

              Prepare a directory of photos to be printed borderless on photo paper with a 3:2 aspect ratio  and
              rotate each page so that its orientation is the same as the input image.

              $ img2pdf --output out.pdf --pagesize 15cmx10cm --auto-orient *.jpg

              Encode  a grayscale JPEG2000 image. The colorspace has to be forced as img2pdf cannot read it from
              the JPEG2000 file automatically.

              $ img2pdf --output out.pdf --colorspace L input.jp2
