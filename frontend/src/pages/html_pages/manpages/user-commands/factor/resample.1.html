</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       resample - resample a 16-bit mono or stereo sound file by an arbitrary factor

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>resample</b> [-by factor] [-to newSrate] [-f filterFile] [-n] [-l] [-trace] [-version] inputFile [outputFile]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>resample</b>  program takes a 16-bit mono or stereo sound file and performs bandlimited interpolation to
       produce an output sound file have a desired new sampling rate.  The output file is in the same format  as
       the input.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-toSrate</b>
              This  option  or  "-byFactor"  is required.  Specify new sampling rate in samples per second.  The
              conversion factor is implied and will be set to the new sampling rate divided by the sampling rate
              of the input soundfile.

       <b>-byFactor</b>
              Specify conversion factor.  This option or "-toSrate" is required.  The conversion factor  is  the
              amount by which the sampling rate is changed.  If the sampling rate of the input signal is Srate1,
              then the sampling rate of the output is factor*Srate1.  For example, a factor of 2.0 increases the
              sampling rate by a factor of 2, giving twice as many samples in the output signal as in the input.
              The  fractional  part  of  the  conversion  factor  is  accurate to 15 bits.  This is sufficiently
              accurate that humans should not be able to hear any error whatsoever in  the  pitch  of  resampled
              sounds.

       <b>-filterFile</b>
              Change  the  resampling  filter  from  its  default.   Such  a  filter file can be designed by the
              <b>windowfilter</b> <b>(1)</b> program (included with the <b>resample</b> distribution).   The  preloaded  filter  file
              requires an oversampling factor of at least 20% to avoid aliasing (in other words, its "transition
              band"  as  a lowpass filter is at least 20% of the useable frequency range in the sampled signal);
              the stop-band attenuation is approximately 80 dB.

       <b>-noFilterInterp</b>
              By default, the resampling filter table is linearly interpolated to provide high audio quality  at
              arbitrary  sampling-rate  conversion  factors.   This  option turns off filter interpolation, thus
              cutting the number of multiply-adds in half in the inner loop (for most conversion factors).

       <b>-linearInterpolation</b>
              Select plain linear interpolation for resampling (which means resampling filter table is not  used
              at  all).  This  option  is very fast, but the output quality is poor unless the signal is already
              heavily oversampled.  Do not confuse linear interpolation of the signal with linear  interpolation
              of the resampling-filter-table which is controlled by the "noFilterInterp" option.

       <b>-terse</b> Disable informational printout.

       <b>-version</b>
              Print program version.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       To  convert  the sampling rate from 48 kHz (used by DAT machines) to 44.1 kHz (the standard sampling rate
       for Compact Discs), the command line would look something like

            resample -to 44100 dat.snd cd.snd or      resample -by 0.91875 dat.snd cd.snd

       Any reasonable sampling rate can be converted to any other.  (Note that, in this  example,  if  you  have
       obtained  a  direct-digital  transfer from DAT or CD, you probably have some pre-emphasis filtering which
       should be canceled using a digital  filter.  See  README.deemph  in  the  <b>resample</b>  release  for  further
       information)

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The first version of this software was written by Julius O. Smith III  &lt;jos  /at/  ccrma  /dot/  stanford
       /dot/  edu&gt;  at  CCRMA &lt;<a href="http://ccrma.stanford.edu">http://ccrma.stanford.edu</a>&gt; in 1981.  It was called SRCONV and was written in SAIL
       for PDP-10 compatible machines (see the DARHP for that code).  The algorithm was first published in

       Smith, Julius O. and Phil Gossett. ``A  Flexible  Sampling-Rate  Conversion  Method,''  Proceedings  (2):
       19.4.1-19.4.4, IEEE Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, San Diego, March 1984.

       An expanded tutorial based on this paper is available at the DARHP.

       Circa 1988, the SRCONV program was translated from SAIL to C by Christopher Lee Fraley working with Roger
       Dannenberg at CMU.

       Since then, the C version has been maintained by jos.

       Sndlib support was added 6/99 by John Gibson &lt;<a href="mailto:jgg9c@virginia.edu">jgg9c@virginia.edu</a>&gt;.
