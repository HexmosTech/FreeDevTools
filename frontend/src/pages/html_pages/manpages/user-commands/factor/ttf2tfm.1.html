</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  program  extracts the metric and kerning information of a TrueType font and converts it into metric
       files usable by TeX (quite similar to <b>afm2tfm</b> which is part of the <b>dvips</b> package; please consult its info
       files for more details on the various parameters (especially encoding files).

       Since a TrueType font often contains more than 256 glyphs, some means are necessary to map  a  subset  of
       the  TrueType  glyphs onto a TeX font.  To do this, two mapping tables are needed: the first (called `in‐
       put' or `raw' encoding) maps the TrueType font to a raw TeX font (this mapping  table  is  used  by  both
       <b>ttf2tfm</b>  and <b>ttf2pk</b>), and the second (called `output' or `virtual' encoding) maps the raw TeX font to an‐
       other (virtual) TeX font, providing all kerning and ligature information needed by TeX.

       This two stage mapping has the advantage that one raw font can be accessed with various  LaTeX  encodings
       (e.g. T1 and OT1) via the virtual font mechanism, and just one PK file is necessary.

       For  CJKV  (Chinese/Japanese/Korean/old Vietnamese) fonts, a different mechanism is provided (see <b>SUBFONT</b>
       <b>DEFINITION</b> <b>FILES</b> below).

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       Most of the command line switch names are the same as in <b>afm2tfm</b> for  convenience.   One  or  more  space
       characters  between  an option and its value is mandatory; options can't be concatenated.  For historical
       reasons, the first parameter can <u>not</u> be a switch but must be the font name.

       <b>-c</b> <u>caps-height-factor</u>
              The height of small caps made with the <b>-V</b> switch.  Default value of this real number is 0.8  times
              the height of uppercase glyphs.

              Will be ignored in subfont mode.

       <b>-e</b> <u>extension-factor</u>
              The  extension  factor  to stretch the characters horizontally.  Default value of this real number
              is 1.0; if less than 1.0, you get a condensed font.

       <b>-E</b> <u>encoding-id</u>
              The TrueType encoding ID.  Default value of this non-negative integer is 1.

              Will be ignored if <b>-N</b> is used.

       <b>-f</b> <u>font-index</u>
              The font index in a TrueType Collection.  Default is the first font (index 0).  [TrueType  collec‐
              tions  are usually found in some CJK fonts; e.g. the first font index specifies glyphs and metrics
              for horizontal writing, and the second font index does the same for  vertical  writing.   TrueType
              collections usually have the extension `.ttc'.]

              Will be ignored for ordinary TrueType fonts.

       <b>-l</b>     Create  ligatures  in subfonts between first and second bytes of all the original character codes.
              Example:  Character code 0xABCD maps to character position 123 in subfont 45.  Then a ligature  in
              subfont 45  between  position 0xAB and 0xCD pointing to character 123 will be produced.  The fonts
              of the Korean HLaTeX package use this feature.  Note that this option generates correct  ligatures
              only for TrueType fonts where the input cmap is identical to the output encoding.  In case of HLa‐
              TeX, TTFs must have platform ID 3 and encoding ID 5.

              Will be ignored if not in subfont mode.

       <b>-L</b> <u>ligature-file</u>
              Same  as  <b>-l</b>,  but  character  codes  for  ligatures are specified in <u>ligature-file</u>.  For example,
              `-L KS-HLaTeX' generates correct ligatures for the Korean HLaTeX package regardless of  the  plat‐
              form and encoding ID of the used TrueType font (the file KS-HLaTeX.sfd is part of the ttf2pk pack‐
              age).

              Ligature  files  have  the same format and extension as SFD files.  This option will be ignored if
              not in subfont mode.

       <b>-n</b>     Use PS names (of glyphs) of the TrueType font.  Only glyphs with a valid  entry  in  the  selected
              cmap are used.

              Will be ignored in subfont mode.

       <b>-N</b>     Use  only PS names of the TrueType font.  No cmap is used, thus the switches <b>-E</b> and <b>-P</b> have no ef‐
              fect, causing a warning message.

              Will be ignored in subfont mode.

       <b>-O</b>     Use octal values for all character codes in the VPL file rather than names;  this  is  useful  for
              symbol or CJK fonts where character names such as `A' are meaningless.

       <b>-p</b> <u>inencfile</u>
              The input encoding file name for the TTF→raw TeX mapping.  This parameter has to be specified in a
              map file (default: ttfonts.map) recorded in ttf2pk.cfg for successive <b>ttf2pk</b> calls.

              Will be ignored in subfont mode.

       <b>-P</b> <u>platform-id</u>
              The TrueType platform ID.  Default value of this non-negative integer is 3.

              Will be ignored if <b>-N</b> is used.

       <b>-q</b>     Make  <b>ttf2tfm</b>  quiet.   It  suppresses any informational output except warning and error messages.
              For CJK fonts, the output can get quite large if you don't specify this switch.

       <b>-r</b> <u>old-glyphname</u> <u>new-glyphname</u>
              Replaces <u>old-glyphname</u> with <u>new-glyphname</u>.  This switch is useful if you want to give  an  unnamed
              glyph  (i.e., a glyph which can be represented with `.gXXX' or `.cXXX' only) a name or if you want
              to rename an already existing glyph name.  You can't use the `.gXXX' or `.cXXX'  glyph  name  con‐
              structs for <u>new-glyphname</u>; multiple occurrences of <b>-r</b> are possible.

              If in subfont mode or if no encoding file is specified, this switch is ignored.

       <b>-R</b> <u>replacement-file</u>
              Use  this switch if you have many replacement pairs; they can be  collected in a file which should
              have `.rpl' as extension.  The syntax used in such replacement files  is  simple:  Each  non-empty
              line must contain a pair `<u>old-glyphname</u> <u>new-glyphname</u>' separated by whitespace (without the quota‐
              tion  marks).  A percent sign starts a line comment; you can continue a line on the next line with
              a backslash as the last character.

              If in subfont mode or if no encoding file is specified, this switch is ignored.

       <b>-s</b> <u>slant-factor</u>
              The obliqueness factor to slant the font, usually much smaller than 1.  Default of this real  num‐
              ber  is 0.0; if the value is larger than zero, the characters slope to the right, otherwise to the
              left.

       <b>-t</b> <u>outencfile</u>
              The output encoding file name for the virtual font(s).  Only characters in the raw  TeX  font  are
              used.

              Will be ignored in subfont mode.

       <b>-T</b> <u>inoutencfile</u>
              This is equivalent to `<b>-p</b> <u>inoutencfile</u> <b>-t</b> <u>inoutencfile</u>'.

              Will be ignored in subfont mode.

       <b>-u</b>     Use  only  those  characters specified in the output encoding, and no others.  By default, <b>ttf2tfm</b>
              tries to include all characters in the virtual font, even those not present in  the  encoding  for
              the virtual font (it puts them into otherwise-unused positions, rather arbitrarily).

              Will be ignored in subfont mode.

       <b>-v</b> <u>vplfile</u>
              Output  a  VPL file in addition to the TFM file.  If no output encoding file is specified, <b>ttf2tfm</b>
              uses a default font encoding (cmtt10).  <b>Note:</b> Be careful to use different names  for  the  virtual
              font and the raw font!

              Will be ignored in subfont mode.

       <b>-V</b> <u>scvplfile</u>
              Same  as <b>-v</b>, but the virtual font generated is a pseudo small caps font obtained by scaling upper‐
              case letters by 0.8 (resp. the value specified with <b>-c</b>) to typeset lowercase.  This  font  handles
              accented letters and retains proper kerning.

              Will be ignored in subfont mode.

       <b>-w</b>     Generate  PostScript  encoding  vectors containing glyph indices, primarily used to embed TrueType
              fonts in pdfTeX.  <b>ttf2tfm</b> takes the TFM names and replaces the suffix  with  .enc;  that  is,  for
              files foo01.tfm, foo02.tfm, ... it creates foo01.enc, foo02.enc, ... at the same place.

              Will be ignored if not in subfont mode.

       <b>-x</b>     Rotate  all  glyphs  by  90  degrees  counter-clockwise.  If no <b>-y</b> parameter is given, the rotated
              glyphs are shifted down vertically by 0.25em.

              Will be ignored if not in subfont mode.

       <b>-y</b> <u>vertical-shift-factor</u>
              Shift down rotated glyphs by the given amount (the unit is <u>em</u>).

              Ignored if not in subfont mode or glyphs are not rotated.

       <b>--version</b>
              Shows the current version of <b>ttf2tfm</b> and the used file search library (e.g.  <b>kpathsea</b>).

       <b>--help</b> Shows usage information.

       If no TFM file name is given, the name of the TTF file is used, including the full path and replacing the
       extension with `.tfm'.

</pre><h4><b>CMAPS</b></h4><pre>
       Contrary to Type 1 PostScript fonts (but similar to the new CID PostScript font  format),  most  TrueType
       fonts  have  more  than one native mapping table, also called `cmap', which maps the (internal) TTF glyph
       indices to the (external) TTF character codes.  Common examples are a mapping table  to  Unicode  encoded
       character positions, and the standard Macintosh mapping.

       To specify a TrueType mapping table, use the options <b>-P</b> and <b>-E</b>.  With <b>-P</b> you specify the platform ID; de‐
       fined values are:

       <u>platform</u>        <u>platform</u> <u>ID</u> <u>(pid)</u>
       ──────────────────────────────────
       Apple Unicode   0
       Macintosh       1
       ISO             2
       Microsoft       3

       The  encoding  ID  depends  on  the platform.  For pid=0, we ignore the <b>-E</b> parameter (setting it to zero)
       since the mapping table is always Unicode version 2.0.  For pid=1, the following table lists the  defined
       values:

              platform ID = 1
       <u>script</u>          <u>encoding</u> <u>ID</u> <u>(eid)</u>
       ──────────────────────────────────

       Here are the ISO encoding IDs:

              platform ID = 2
       <u>encoding</u>     <u>encoding</u> <u>ID</u> <u>(eid)</u>
       ASCII        0
       ISO 10646    1
       ISO 8859-1   2

       And finally, the Microsoft encoding IDs:

              platform ID = 3
       <u>encoding</u>              <u>encoding</u> <u>ID</u> <u>(eid)</u>
       Symbol                0
       Unicode 2.0           1
       Shift JIS             2
       GB 2312 (1980)        3
       Big 5                 4
       KS X 1001 (Wansung)   5
       KS X 1001 (Johab)     6
       UCS-4                 10

       The program will abort if you specify an invalid platform/encoding ID pair.  It will then show the possi‐
       ble pid/eid pairs.  Please note that most fonts have at most two or three cmaps, usually corresponding to
       the pid/eid pairs (1,0), (3,0), or (3,1) in case of Latin based fonts.  Valid Microsoft fonts should have
       a  (3,1)  mapping table, but some fonts exist (mostly Asian fonts) which have a (3,1) cmap not encoded in
       Unicode.  The reason for this strange behavior is the fact that some old MS Windows versions will  reject
       fonts having a non-(3,1) cmap (since all non-Unicode Microsoft encoding IDs are for Asian MS Windows ver‐
       sions).

       The  <b>-P</b> and <b>-E</b> options of <b>ttf2tfm</b> must be equally specified for <b>ttf2pk</b>; the corresponding parameters in a
       map file are `Pid' and `Eid', respectively.

       The default pid/eid pair is (3,1).

       Similarly, an <b>-f</b> option must be specified as `Fontindex' parameter in a map file.

       If you use the <b>-N</b> switch, all cmaps are ignored, using only the PostScript names in  the  TrueType  font.
       The  corresponding  option in a map file is `PS=Only'.  If you use the <b>-n</b> switch, the default glyph names
       built into <b>ttf2tfm</b> are replaced with the PS glyph names found in the font.  In many  cases  this  is  not
       what you want because the glyph names in the font are often incorrect or non-standard.  The corresponding
       option in a map file is `PS=Yes'.

       Single  replacement glyph names specified with <b>-r</b> must be given directly as `<u>old-glyphname</u> <u>new-glyphname</u>'
       in a map file; <b>-R</b> is equivalent to the `Replacement' option.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>AND</b> <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>ENCODINGS</b></h4><pre>
       You must specify the encoding vectors from the TrueType font to the raw TeX font and  from  the  raw  TeX
       font  to  the  virtual  TeX  font exactly as with <b>afm2tfm</b>, but you have more possibilities to address the
       character codes.  [With `encoding vector' a mapping table with 256 entries in form of a PostScript vector
       is meant; see the file T1-WGL4.enc of this package for an example.]  With <b>afm2tfm</b>, you must  access  each
       glyph  with  its  Adobe  glyph name, e.g. `/quotedsingle' or `/Acircumflex'.  This has been extended with
       <b>ttf2tfm</b>; now you can (and sometimes must) access the code points and/or glyphs directly, using  the  fol‐
       lowing syntax for specifying the character position in decimal, octal, or hexadecimal notation: `/.c<u>&lt;dec‐</u>
       <u>imal-number&gt;</u>',  `/.c0<u>&lt;octal-number&gt;</u>',  or  `/.c0x<u>&lt;hexadecimal-number&gt;</u>'.   Examples:  `/.c72',  `/.c0646',
       `/.c0x48'.  To access a glyph index directly, use the character `g' instead of `c' in the just introduced
       notation.  Example: `/.g0x32'.  [Note: The `.cXXX' notation makes no sense if <b>-N</b> is used.]

       For pid/eid pairs (1,0) and (3,1), both <b>ttf2tfm</b> and <b>ttf2pk</b> recognize built-in default Adobe glyph  names;
       the former follows the names given in Appendix E of the book `Inside Macintosh', volume 6, the latter us‐
       es  the  names given in the TrueType Specification (WGL4, a Unicode subset).  Note that Adobe names for a
       given glyph are often not unique and do sometimes differ, e.g., many PS fonts have the glyph `mu', where‐
       as this glyph is called `mu1' in the WGL4 character set to distinguish it from the real Greek letter  mu.
       Be also aware that OpenType (i.e. TrueType 2.0) fonts use an updated WGL4 table; we use the data from the
       latest  published  TrueType  specification  (1.66).  You can find those mapping tables in the source code
       file ttfenc.c.

       On the other hand, the switches <b>-n</b> and <b>-N</b> makes <b>ttf2tfm</b> read in and use the PostScript names in the True‐
       Type font itself (stored in the `post' table) instead of the default Adobe glyph names.

       Use the <b>-r</b> switch to remap single glyph names and <b>-R</b> to specify a file containing replacement glyph  name
       pairs.

       If  you  don't  select an input encoding, the first 256 glyphs of the TrueType font with a valid entry in
       the selected cmap will be mapped to the TeX raw font (without the <b>-q</b> option, <b>ttf2tfm</b> prints this  mapping
       table  to standard output), followed by all glyphs not yet addressed in the selected cmap.  However, some
       code points for the (1,0) pid/eid pair are omitted since they do not represent  glyphs  useful  for  TeX:
       0x00 (null), 0x08 (backspace), 0x09 (horizontal tabulation), 0x0d (carriage return), and 0x1d (group sep‐
       arator).  The `invalid character' with glyph index 0 will be omitted too.

       If  you select the <b>-N</b> switch, the first 256 glyphs of the TrueType font with a valid PostScript name will
       be used in case no input encoding is specified.  Again, some glyphs are omitted:  `.notdef', `.null', and
       `nonmarkingreturn'.

       If you don't select an  output encoding, <b>ttf2tfm</b> uses the same mapping table as <b>afm2tfm</b>  would  use  (you
       can  find  it in the source code file texenc.c); it corresponds to TeX typewriter text.  Unused positions
       (either caused by empty code points in the mapping table or missing glyphs in the TrueType font) will  be
       filled (rather arbitrarily) with characters present in the input encoding but not specified in the output
       encoding (without the <b>-q</b> option <b>ttf2tfm</b> prints the final output encoding to standard output).  Use the <b>-u</b>
       option  if  you  want  only glyphs in the virtual font which are defined in the output encoding file, and
       nothing more.

       One feature missing in <b>afm2tfm</b> has been added which is needed by LaTeX's T1 encoding: <b>ttf2tfm</b>  will  con‐
       struct the glyph `Germandbls' (by simply concatenating two `S' glyphs) even for normal fonts if possible.
       It appears in the glyph list as the last item, marked with an asterisk.  Since this isn't a real glyph it
       will be available only in the virtual font.

       For both input and output encoding, an empty code position is represented by the glyph name `/.notdef'.

       In encoding files, you can use `\' as the final character of a line to indicate that the input is contin‐
       ued on the next line.  The backslash and the following newline character will be removed.

</pre><h4><b>SUBFONT</b> <b>DEFINITION</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       CJKV  (Chinese/Japanese/Korean/old Vietnamese) fonts usually contain several thousand glyphs; to use them
       with TeX it is necessary to split such large fonts into subfonts.  Subfont definition files (usually hav‐
       ing the extension `.sfd') are a simple means to do this smoothly.

       A subfont file name usually consists of a prefix, a subfont infix, and a postfix (which is empty in  most
       cases), e.g.

         ntukai23 → prefix: ntukai, infix: 23, postfix: (empty)

       Here the syntax of a line in an SFD file, describing one subfont:

       <u>&lt;whitespace&gt;</u> <u>&lt;infix&gt;</u> <u>&lt;whitespace&gt;</u> <u>&lt;ranges&gt;</u> <u>&lt;whitespace&gt;</u>

       <u>&lt;infix&gt;</u> :=
              anything except whitespace.  It is best to use only alphanumerical characters.

       <u>&lt;whitespace&gt;</u> :=
              space, formfeed, carriage return, horizontal and vertical tabs -- no newline characters.

       <u>&lt;ranges&gt;</u> :=
              <u>&lt;ranges&gt;</u> <u>&lt;whitespace&gt;</u> <u>&lt;codepoint&gt;</u> |
              <u>&lt;ranges&gt;</u> <u>&lt;whitespace&gt;</u> <u>&lt;range&gt;</u> |
              <u>&lt;ranges&gt;</u> <u>&lt;whitespace&gt;</u> <u>&lt;offset&gt;</u> <u>&lt;whitespace&gt;</u> <u>&lt;range&gt;</u>

       <u>&lt;codepoint&gt;</u> :=
              <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>

       <u>&lt;range&gt;</u> :=
              <u>&lt;number&gt;</u> `_' <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>

       <u>&lt;offset&gt;</u> :=
              <u>&lt;number&gt;</u> `:'

       <u>&lt;number&gt;</u> :=
              hexadecimal (prefix `0x'), decimal, or octal (prefix `0')

       A  line can be continued on the next line with a backslash ending the line.  The ranges must not overlap;
       offsets have to be in the range 0-255.

       Example:

         The line

           03   10: 0x2349 0x2345_0x2347

         assigns to the code positions 10, 11, 12, and 13 of the subfont having the  infix  `03'  the  character
         codes 0x2349, 0x2345, 0x2346, and 0x2347 respectively.

       The SFD files in the distribution are customized for the CJK package for LaTeX.

       You  have  to  embed  the SFD file name into the TFM font name (at the place where the infix will appear)
       surrounded by two `@' signs, on the command line resp. a map file; both <b>ttf2tfm</b> and <b>ttf2pk</b> switch then to
       subfont mode.

       It is possible to use more than a single SFD file by separating them with commata and no whitespace;  for
       a  given  subfont,  the first file is scanned for an entry, then the next file, and so on.  Later entries
       override entries found earlier (possibly only partially).  For example, the first SFD file sets up  range
       0x10-0xA0, and the next one modifies entries 0x12 and 0x25.  As can be easily seen, this algorithm allows
       for adding and replacing, but not for removing entries.

       Subfont  mode  disables the options <b>-n</b>, <b>-N</b>, <b>-p</b>, <b>-r</b>, <b>-R</b>, <b>-t</b>, <b>-T</b>, <b>-u</b>, <b>-v</b>, <b>-V</b> and <b>-w</b> for <b>ttf2tfm</b>; similarly,
       no `Encoding' or `Replacement' parameter is allowed in a map file.  Single replacement  glyph  names  are
       ignored too.

       <b>ttf2tfm</b>  will  create  all  subfont  TFM  files specified in the SFD files (provided the subfont contains
       glyphs) in one run.

       Example:

         The call

           ttf2tfm ntukai.ttf ntukai@Big5,Big5-supp@

         will use Big5.sfd and Big5-supp.sfd, producing <u>all</u> subfont files ntukai01.tfm, ntukai02.tfm, etc.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       ttf2tfm returns 0 on success and 1 on error; warning and error messages are written to standard error.

</pre><h4><b>SOME</b> <b>NOTES</b> <b>ON</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>SEARCHING</b></h4><pre>
       Both <b>ttf2pk</b> and <b>ttf2tfm</b> use either the <b>kpathsea</b>, <b>emtexdir</b>, or <b>MiKTeX</b> library  for  searching  files  (<b>em‐</b>
       <b>texdir</b>  will  work only on operating systems which have an MS-DOSish background, i.e.  MS-DOS, OS/2, Win‐
       dows; <b>MikTeX</b> is specific to MS Windows).

       As a last resort, both programs can be compiled without a search library; the searched files must be then
       in the current directory or specified with a path.  Default extensions will be appended  also  (with  the
       exception that only `.ttf' is appended and not `.ttc').

   <b>kpathsea</b>
       The  actual  version  of  kpathsea  is  displayed on screen if you call either <b>ttf2pk</b> or <b>ttf2tfm</b> with the
       <b>--version</b> command line switch.

       Here is a table of the file type and the corresponding <b>kpathsea</b> variables.  TTF2PKINPUTS  and  TTF2TFMIN‐
       PUTS are program specific environment variables introduced in <b>kpathsea</b> version 3.2:

              .ttf and .ttc   TTFONTS
              ttf2pk.cfg      TTF2PKINPUTS
              .map            TTF2PKINPUTS
              .enc            TTF2PKINPUTS, TTF2TFMINPUTS
              .rpl            TTF2PKINPUTS, TTF2TFMINPUTS
              .tfm            TFMFONTS
              .sfd            TTF2PKINPUTS, TTF2TFMINPUTS

       Please consult the info files of <b>kpathsea</b> for details on these variables.

       You should set the TEXMFCNF variable to the directory where your texmf.cnf configuration file resides.

       Here  is  the  proper command to find out to which value a <b>kpathsea</b> variable is set (we use TTFONTS as an
       example).  This is especially useful if a variable isn't set in texmf.cnf or  in  the  environment,  thus
       pointing to the default value which is hard-coded into the <b>kpathsea</b> library.

              kpsewhich -progname=ttf2tfm -expand-var='$TTFONTS'

       We  select  the program name also since it is possible to specify variables which are searched only for a
       certain program -- in our example it would be TTFONTS.ttf2tfm.

       A similar but not identical method is to say

         kpsewhich -progname=ttf2tfm -show-path='truetype fonts'

       [A full list of format types can be obtained by saying `kpsewhich --help' on the  command  line  prompt.]
       This  is  exactly how <b>ttf2tfm</b> (and <b>ttf2pk</b>) searches for files; the disadvantage is that all variables are
       expanded which can cause very long strings.

   <b>emtexdir</b>
       Here the list of suffixes and their related environment variables to be set  in  autoexec.bat  (resp.  in
       config.sys for OS/2):

              .ttf and .ttc   TTFONTS
              ttf2pk.cfg      TTFCFG
              .map            TTFCFG
              .enc            TTFCFG
              .rpl            TTFCFG
              .tfm            TEXTFM
              .sfd            TTFCFG

       If  one  of the variables isn't set, a warning message is emitted.  The current directory will always  be
       searched.  As usual, one exclamation mark appended to a directory path causes  subdirectories  one  level
       deep to be searched, two exclamation marks cause all subdirectories to be searched.  Example:

         TTFONTS=c:\fonts\truetype!!;d:\myfonts\truetype!

       Constructions like `c:\fonts!!\truetype' aren't possible.

   <b>MiKTeX</b>
       Both  <b>ttf2tfm</b>  and  <b>ttf2pk</b>  have been fully integrated into <b>MiKTeX</b>.  Please refer to the documentation of
       <b>MiKTeX</b> for more details on file searching.

</pre><h4><b>PROBLEMS</b></h4><pre>
       Many <b>vptovf</b> implementations allow only 100 bytes for the TFM header (the limit is 1024 in  the  TFM  file
       format  itself): 8 bytes for checksum and design size, 40 bytes for the family name, 20 bytes for the en‐
       coding, and 4 bytes for a face byte.  There remain only 28 bytes for some additional information which is
       used by <b>ttf2tfm</b> for an identification string (which is essentially a copy of the command line), and  this
       limit is always exceeded.

       The  optimal  solution  is to increase the value of <u>max_header_bytes</u> in the file vptovf.web (and probably
       pltotf.web too) to, say, 400 and recompile <b>vptovf</b> (and <b>pltotf</b>).  Otherwise you'll get some (harmless) er‐
       ror messages like

         This HEADER index is too big for my present table size

       which can be safely ignored.
