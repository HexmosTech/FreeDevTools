</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mShrinkCube - Reduce the size of a FITS cube

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       mShrinkCube [-f] [-d <u>level</u>] [-h <u>hdu</u>] [-m factor] [-s <u>statusfile</u>] in.fits out.fits factor

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A utility for reducing the size of a FITS cube, by averaging blocks of pixels by any factor spatially and
       by integer factors in the third dimension.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -f     Fixed-size  flag  -  specify  output  size of image, instead of the size of blocks of pixels to be
              averaged

       -d <u>level</u>
              Turns on debugging to the specified level (1-4).

       -h <u>hdu</u> Use the specified FITS extension (default is to use the first HDU with image data)

       -m <u>factor</u>
              The (positive integer) factor by which to compress the cube  in  the  third  (usually  wavelength-
              related) dimension.

       -s <u>statusfile</u>
              Output and errors are sent to <u>statusfile</u> instead of to stdout

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       in.fits
              Input FITS cube

       out.fits
              Path to output FITS cube.

       factor Size of blocks, in (fractional) pixels, to average. File size will be reduced by 1/<u>factor</u> squared.
              If the -f (fixed-size) flag is used, <u>factor</u> is the desired width of the output image.

</pre><h4><b>RESULT</b></h4><pre>
       [Normal mode]: FITS output image, reduced in size by a factor of (1/<u>factor</u>)^2  .

       [Fixed-size mode]: FITS output image of width <u>factor</u>

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       OK     [struct stat="OK"]

       ERROR  Cannot open status file: <u>statusfile</u>

       ERROR  Image size <u>factor</u> cannot be interpreted as an real number

       ERROR  Shrink factor <u>factor</u> cannot be interpreted as an real number

       ERROR  [struct stat="ERROR", msg=

       ERROR  HDU value (<u>n</u>) must be a non-negative integer

       ERROR  Third axis compression factor (<u>n</u>) must be a positive integer

       ERROR  Image file <u>in.fits</u> missing of invalid FITS.

       ERROR  <u>FITS</u> <u>library</u> <u>error</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       $ mShrinkCube final/out.fits final/out-lowres_5.fits 5
              [struct stat="OK"]

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The drizzle algorithm has been implemented but has not been tested in this release.

       If a header template contains carriage returns (i.e., created/modified on a Windows machine), the cfitsio
       library  will  be  unable  to read it properly, resulting in the error: [struct stat="ERROR", status=207,
       msg="illegal character in keyword"]

       It is best for the background correction  algorithms  if  the  area  described  in  the  header  template
       completely encloses all of the input images in their entirety. If parts of input images are "chopped off"
       by  the  header  template,  the  background correction will be affected. We recommend you use an expanded
       header for the reprojection and background modeling steps, returning to  the  originally  desired  header
       size  for  the  final  coaddition.  The  default background matching assumes that there are no non-linear
       background variations in the individual images (and therefore in the overlap differences).  If  there  is
       any  uncertainty  in  this  regard, it is safer to turn on the "level only" background matching (the "-l"
       flag in mBgModel.
