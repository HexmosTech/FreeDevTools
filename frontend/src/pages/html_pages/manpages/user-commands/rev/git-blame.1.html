       git-blame - Show what revision and author last modified each line of a file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>git</u> <u>blame</u> [-c] [-b] [-l] [--root] [-t] [-f] [-n] [-s] [-e] [-p] [-w] [--incremental]
                   [-L &lt;range&gt;] [-S &lt;revs-file&gt;] [-M] [-C] [-C] [-C] [--since=&lt;date&gt;]
                   [--ignore-rev &lt;rev&gt;] [--ignore-revs-file &lt;file&gt;]
                   [--color-lines] [--color-by-age] [--progress] [--abbrev=&lt;n&gt;]
                   [ --contents &lt;file&gt; ] [&lt;rev&gt; | --reverse &lt;rev&gt;..&lt;rev&gt;] [--] &lt;file&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Annotates each line in the given file with information from the revision which last modified the line.
       Optionally, start annotating from the given revision.

       When specified one or more times, <b>-L</b> restricts annotation to the requested lines.

       The origin of lines is automatically followed across whole-file renames (currently there is no option to
       turn the rename-following off). To follow lines moved from one file to another, or to follow lines that
       were copied and pasted from another file, etc., see the <b>-C</b> and <b>-M</b> options.

       The report does not tell you anything about lines which have been deleted or replaced; you need to use a
       tool such as <u>git</u> <u>diff</u> or the "pickaxe" interface briefly mentioned in the following paragraph.

       Apart from supporting file annotation, Git also supports searching the development history for when a
       code snippet occurred in a change. This makes it possible to track when a code snippet was added to a
       file, moved or copied between files, and eventually deleted or replaced. It works by searching for a text
       string in the diff. A small example of the pickaxe interface that searches for <b>blame_usage</b>:

           $ git log --pretty=oneline -S'blame_usage'
           5040f17eba15504bad66b14a645bddd9b015ebb7 blame -S &lt;ancestry-file&gt;
           ea4c7f9bf69e781dd0cd88d2bccb2bf5cc15c9a7 git-blame: Make the output

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -b
           Show blank SHA-1 for boundary commits. This can also be controlled via the <b>blame.blankBoundary</b> config
           option.

       --root
           Do not treat root commits as boundaries. This can also be controlled via the <b>blame.showRoot</b> config
           option.

       --show-stats
           Include additional statistics at the end of blame output.

       -L &lt;start&gt;,&lt;end&gt;, -L :&lt;funcname&gt;
           Annotate only the line range given by <u>&lt;start&gt;,&lt;end&gt;</u>, or by the function name regex <u>&lt;funcname&gt;</u>. May be
           specified multiple times. Overlapping ranges are allowed.

           <u>&lt;start&gt;</u> and <u>&lt;end&gt;</u> are optional.  <b>-L</b> <u>&lt;start&gt;</u> or <b>-L</b> <u>&lt;start&gt;</u><b>,</b> spans from <u>&lt;start&gt;</u> to end of file.  <b>-L</b>
           <b>,</b><u>&lt;end&gt;</u> spans from start of file to <u>&lt;end&gt;</u>.

           <u>&lt;start&gt;</u> and <u>&lt;end&gt;</u> can take one of these forms:

           •   number

               If <u>&lt;start&gt;</u> or <u>&lt;end&gt;</u> is a number, it specifies an absolute line number (lines count from 1).

           •   <b>/regex/</b>

               This form will use the first line matching the given POSIX regex. If <u>&lt;start&gt;</u> is a regex, it will
               search from the end of the previous <b>-L</b> range, if any, otherwise from the start of file. If
               <u>&lt;start&gt;</u> is <b>^/regex/</b>, it will search from the start of file. If <u>&lt;end&gt;</u> is a regex, it will search
               starting at the line given by <u>&lt;start&gt;</u>.

           •   +offset or -offset

               This is only valid for <u>&lt;end&gt;</u> and will specify a number of lines before or after the line given by
               <u>&lt;start&gt;</u>.

           If <b>:</b><u>&lt;funcname&gt;</u> is given in place of <u>&lt;start&gt;</u> and <u>&lt;end&gt;</u>, it is a regular expression that denotes the
           range from the first funcname line that matches <u>&lt;funcname&gt;</u>, up to the next funcname line.
           <b>:</b><u>&lt;funcname&gt;</u> searches from the end of the previous <b>-L</b> range, if any, otherwise from the start of file.
           <b>^:</b><u>&lt;funcname&gt;</u> searches from the start of file. The function names are determined in the same way as
           <b>git</b> <b>diff</b> works out patch hunk headers (see <u>Defining</u> <u>a</u> <u>custom</u> <u>hunk-header</u> in <b><a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes</a></b>(5)).

       -l
           Show long rev (Default: off).

       -t
           Show raw timestamp (Default: off).

       -S &lt;revs-file&gt;
           Use revisions from revs-file instead of calling <b><a href="../man1/git-rev-list.1.html">git-rev-list</a></b>(1).

       --reverse &lt;rev&gt;..&lt;rev&gt;
           Walk history forward instead of backward. Instead of showing the revision in which a line appeared,
           this shows the last revision in which a line has existed. This requires a range of revision like
           START..END where the path to blame exists in START.  <b>git</b> <b>blame</b> <b>--reverse</b> <b>START</b> is taken as <b>git</b> <b>blame</b>
           <b>--reverse</b> <b>START..HEAD</b> for convenience.

       --first-parent
           Follow only the first parent commit upon seeing a merge commit. This option can be used to determine
           when a line was introduced to a particular integration branch, rather than when it was introduced to
           the history overall.

       -p, --porcelain
           Show in a format designed for machine consumption.

       --line-porcelain
           Show the porcelain format, but output commit information for each line, not just the first time a
           commit is referenced. Implies --porcelain.

       --incremental
           Show the result incrementally in a format designed for machine consumption.

       --encoding=&lt;encoding&gt;
           Specifies the encoding used to output author names and commit summaries. Setting it to <b>none</b> makes
           blame output unconverted data. For more information see the discussion about encoding in the <b><a href="../man1/gitlog.1.html">git-</a></b>
           <b><a href="../man1/gitlog.1.html">log</a></b>(1) manual page.

       --contents &lt;file&gt;
           Annotate using the contents from the named file, starting from &lt;rev&gt; if it is specified, and HEAD
           otherwise. You may specify <u>-</u> to make the command read from the standard input for the file contents.

       --date &lt;format&gt;
           Specifies the format used to output dates. If --date is not provided, the value of the blame.date
           config variable is used. If the blame.date config variable is also not set, the iso format is used.
           For supported values, see the discussion of the --date option at <b><a href="../man1/git-log.1.html">git-log</a></b>(1).

       --[no-]progress
           Progress status is reported on the standard error stream by default when it is attached to a
           terminal. This flag enables progress reporting even if not attached to a terminal. Can’t use
           <b>--progress</b> together with <b>--porcelain</b> or <b>--incremental</b>.

       -M[&lt;num&gt;]
           Detect moved or copied lines within a file. When a commit moves or copies a block of lines (e.g. the
           original file has A and then B, and the commit changes it to B and then A), the traditional <u>blame</u>
           algorithm notices only half of the movement and typically blames the lines that were moved up (i.e.
           B) to the parent and assigns blame to the lines that were moved down (i.e. A) to the child commit.
           With this option, both groups of lines are blamed on the parent by running extra passes of
           inspection.

           &lt;num&gt; is optional but it is the lower bound on the number of alphanumeric characters that Git must
           detect as moving/copying within a file for it to associate those lines with the parent commit. The
           default value is 20.

       -C[&lt;num&gt;]
           In addition to <b>-M</b>, detect lines moved or copied from other files that were modified in the same
           commit. This is useful when you reorganize your program and move code around across files. When this
           option is given twice, the command additionally looks for copies from other files in the commit that
           creates the file. When this option is given three times, the command additionally looks for copies
           from other files in any commit.

           &lt;num&gt; is optional but it is the lower bound on the number of alphanumeric characters that Git must
           detect as moving/copying between files for it to associate those lines with the parent commit. And
           the default value is 40. If there are more than one <b>-C</b> options given, the &lt;num&gt; argument of the last
           <b>-C</b> will take effect.

       --ignore-rev &lt;rev&gt;
           Ignore changes made by the revision when assigning blame, as if the change never happened. Lines that
           were changed or added by an ignored commit will be blamed on the previous commit that changed that
           line or nearby lines. This option may be specified multiple times to ignore more than one revision.
           If the <b>blame.markIgnoredLines</b> config option is set, then lines that were changed by an ignored commit
           and attributed to another commit will be marked with a ? in the blame output. If the
           <b>blame.markUnblamableLines</b> config option is set, then those lines touched by an ignored commit that we
           could not attribute to another revision are marked with a <u>*</u>.

       --ignore-revs-file &lt;file&gt;
           Ignore revisions listed in <b>file</b>, which must be in the same format as an <b>fsck.skipList</b>. This option
           may be repeated, and these files will be processed after any files specified with the
           <b>blame.ignoreRevsFile</b> config option. An empty file name, "", will clear the list of revs from
           previously processed files.

       --color-lines
           Color line annotations in the default format differently if they come from the same commit as the
           preceding line. This makes it easier to distinguish code blocks introduced by different commits. The
           color defaults to cyan and can be adjusted using the <b>color.blame.repeatedLines</b> config option.

       --color-by-age
           Color line annotations depending on the age of the line in the default format. The
           <b>color.blame.highlightRecent</b> config option controls what color is used for each range of age.

       -h
           Show help message.

       -c
           Use the same output mode as <b><a href="../man1/git-annotate.1.html">git-annotate</a></b>(1) (Default: off).

       --score-debug
           Include debugging information related to the movement of lines between files (see <b>-C</b>) and lines moved
           within a file (see <b>-M</b>). The first number listed is the score. This is the number of alphanumeric
           characters detected as having been moved between or within files. This must be above a certain
           threshold for <u>git</u> <u>blame</u> to consider those lines of code to have been moved.

       -f, --show-name
           Show the filename in the original commit. By default the filename is shown if there is any line that
           came from a file with a different name, due to rename detection.

       -n, --show-number
           Show the line number in the original commit (Default: off).

       -s
           Suppress the author name and timestamp from the output.

       -e, --show-email
           Show the author email instead of the author name (Default: off). This can also be controlled via the
           <b>blame.showEmail</b> config option.

       -w
           Ignore whitespace when comparing the parent’s version and the child’s to find where the lines came
           from.

       --abbrev=&lt;n&gt;
           Instead of using the default 7+1 hexadecimal digits as the abbreviated object name, use &lt;m&gt;+1 digits,
           where &lt;m&gt; is at least &lt;n&gt; but ensures the commit object names are unique. Note that 1 column is used
           for a caret to mark the boundary commit.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>DEFAULT</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       When neither <b>--porcelain</b> nor <b>--incremental</b> option is specified, <b>git</b> <b>blame</b> will output annotation for each
       line with:

       •   abbreviated object name for the commit the line came from;

       •   author ident (by default the author name and date, unless <b>-s</b> or <b>-e</b> is specified); and

       •   line number

       before the line contents.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>PORCELAIN</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       In this format, each line is output after a header; the header at the minimum has the first line which
       has:

       •   40-byte SHA-1 of the commit the line is attributed to;

       •   the line number of the line in the original file;

       •   the line number of the line in the final file;

       •   on a line that starts a group of lines from a different commit than the previous one, the number of
           lines in this group. On subsequent lines this field is absent.

       This header line is followed by the following information at least once for each commit:

       •   the author name ("author"), email ("author-mail"), time ("author-time"), and time zone ("author-tz");
           similarly for committer.

       •   the filename in the commit that the line is attributed to.

       •   the first line of the commit log message ("summary").

       The contents of the actual line are output after the above header, prefixed by a TAB. This is to allow
       adding more header elements later.

       The porcelain format generally suppresses commit information that has already been seen. For example, two
       lines that are blamed to the same commit will both be shown, but the details for that commit will be
       shown only once. This is more efficient, but may require more state be kept by the reader. The
       <b>--line-porcelain</b> option can be used to output full commit information for each line, allowing simpler
       (but less efficient) usage like:

           # count the number of lines attributed to each author
           git blame --line-porcelain file |
           sed -n 's/^author //p' |
           sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

</pre><h4><b>SPECIFYING</b> <b>RANGES</b></h4><pre>
       Unlike <u>git</u> <u>blame</u> and <u>git</u> <u>annotate</u> in older versions of git, the extent of the annotation can be limited
       to both line ranges and revision ranges. The <b>-L</b> option, which limits annotation to a range of lines, may
       be specified multiple times.

       When you are interested in finding the origin for lines 40-60 for file <b>foo</b>, you can use the <b>-L</b> option
       like so (they mean the same thing — both ask for 21 lines starting at line 40):

           git blame -L 40,60 foo
           git blame -L 40,+21 foo

       Also you can use a regular expression to specify the line range:

           git blame -L '/^sub hello {/,/^}$/' foo

       which limits the annotation to the body of the <b>hello</b> subroutine.

       When you are not interested in changes older than version v2.6.18, or changes older than 3 weeks, you can
       use revision range specifiers similar to <u>git</u> <u>rev-list</u>:

           git blame v2.6.18.. -- foo
           git blame --since=3.weeks -- foo

       When revision range specifiers are used to limit the annotation, lines that have not changed since the
       range boundary (either the commit v2.6.18 or the most recent commit that is more than 3 weeks old in the
       above example) are blamed for that range boundary commit.

       A particularly useful way is to see if an added file has lines created by copy-and-paste from existing
       files. Sometimes this indicates that the developer was being sloppy and did not refactor the code
       properly. You can first find the commit that introduced the file with:

           git log --diff-filter=A --pretty=short -- foo

       and then annotate the change between the commit and its parents, using <b>commit^</b>! notation:

           git blame -C -C -f $commit^! -- foo

</pre><h4><b>INCREMENTAL</b> <b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       When called with <b>--incremental</b> option, the command outputs the result as it is built. The output
       generally will talk about lines touched by more recent commits first (i.e. the lines will be annotated
       out of order) and is meant to be used by interactive viewers.

       The output format is similar to the Porcelain format, but it does not contain the actual lines from the
       file that is being annotated.

        1. Each blame entry always starts with a line of:

               &lt;40-byte-hex-sha1&gt; &lt;sourceline&gt; &lt;resultline&gt; &lt;num-lines&gt;

           Line numbers count from 1.

        2. The first time that a commit shows up in the stream, it has various other information about it
           printed out with a one-word tag at the beginning of each line describing the extra commit information
           (author, email, committer, dates, summary, etc.).

        3. Unlike the Porcelain format, the filename information is always given and terminates the entry:

               "filename" &lt;whitespace-quoted-filename-goes-here&gt;

           and thus it is really quite easy to parse for some line- and word-oriented parser (which should be
           quite natural for most scripting languages).

               <b>Note</b>
               For people who do parsing: to make it more robust, just ignore any lines between the first and
               last one ("&lt;sha1&gt;" and "filename" lines) where you do not recognize the tag words (or care about
               that particular one) at the beginning of the "extended information" lines. That way, if there is
               ever added information (like the commit encoding or extended commit commentary), a blame viewer
               will not care.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Everything below this line in this section is selectively included from the <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1) documentation.
       The content is the same as what’s found there:

       blame.blankBoundary
           Show blank commit object name for boundary commits in <b><a href="../man1/git-blame.1.html">git-blame</a></b>(1). This option defaults to false.

       blame.coloring
           This determines the coloring scheme to be applied to blame output. It can be <u>repeatedLines</u>,
           <u>highlightRecent</u>, or <u>none</u> which is the default.

       blame.date
           Specifies the format used to output dates in <b><a href="../man1/git-blame.1.html">git-blame</a></b>(1). If unset the iso format is used. For
           supported values, see the discussion of the <b>--date</b> option at <b><a href="../man1/git-log.1.html">git-log</a></b>(1).

       blame.showEmail
           Show the author email instead of author name in <b><a href="../man1/git-blame.1.html">git-blame</a></b>(1). This option defaults to false.

       blame.showRoot
           Do not treat root commits as boundaries in <b><a href="../man1/git-blame.1.html">git-blame</a></b>(1). This option defaults to false.

       blame.ignoreRevsFile
           Ignore revisions listed in the file, one unabbreviated object name per line, in <b><a href="../man1/git-blame.1.html">git-blame</a></b>(1).
           Whitespace and comments beginning with # are ignored. This option may be repeated multiple times.
           Empty file names will reset the list of ignored revisions. This option will be handled before the
           command line option <b>--ignore-revs-file</b>.

       blame.markUnblamableLines
           Mark lines that were changed by an ignored revision that we could not attribute to another commit
           with a <u>*</u> in the output of <b><a href="../man1/git-blame.1.html">git-blame</a></b>(1).

       blame.markIgnoredLines
           Mark lines that were changed by an ignored revision that we attributed to another commit with a <u>?</u>  in
