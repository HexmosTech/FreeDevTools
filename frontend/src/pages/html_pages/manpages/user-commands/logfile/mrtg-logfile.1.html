</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mrtg-logfile - description of the mrtg-2 logfile format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This document provides a description of the contents of the mrtg-2 logfile.

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       The logfile consists of two main sections.

       The first Line
           It stores the traffic counters from the most recent run of mrtg.

       The rest of the File
           Stores past traffic rate averages and maximum at increasing intervals.

       The first number on each line is a unix time stamp. It represents the number of seconds since 1970.

</pre><h4><b>DETAILS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>Line</b>
       The first line has 3 numbers which are:

       A (1st column)
           A  timestamp  of  when  MRTG  last  ran  for this interface.  The timestamp is the number of non-skip
           seconds passed since the standard UNIX "epoch" of midnight on 1st of January 1970 GMT.

       B (2nd column)
           The "incoming bytes counter" value.

       C (3rd column)
           The "outgoing bytes counter" value.

   <b>The</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>File</b>
       The second and remaining lines of the file contains 5 numbers which are:

       A (1st column)
           The Unix timestamp for the point in time the data on this line is relevant.  Note that  the  interval
           between  timestamps  increases  as you progress through the file. At first it is 5 minutes and at the
           end it is one day between two lines.

           This timestamp may be converted in OpenOffice Calc or MS Excel by using the following formula

            =(x+y)/86400+DATE(1970;1;1)

           (instead of ";" it may be that you have to use "," this  depends  on  the  context  and  your  locale
           settings)

           you can also ask perl to help by typing

            perl -e 'print scalar localtime(x),"\n"'

           <b>x</b> is the unix timestamp and <b>y</b> is the offset in seconds from UTC. (Perl knows <b>y</b>).

       B (2nd column)
           The  average  incoming  transfer  rate  in bytes per second. This is valid for the time between the A
           value of the current line and the A value of the previous line.

       C (3rd column)
           The average outgoing transfer rate in bytes per second since the previous measurement.

       D (4th column)
           The maximum incoming transfer rate in bytes per second for the current interval. This  is  calculated
           from  all the updates which have occurred in the current interval. If the current interval is 1 hour,
           and updates have occurred every 5 minutes, it will be the biggest 5 minute transfer rate seen  during
           the hour.

       E (5th column)
           The maximum outgoing transfer rate in bytes per second for the current interval.
