</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl5143delta - what is new for perl v5.14.3

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.14.2 release and the 5.14.3 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.12.0, first read perl5140delta, which describes
       differences between 5.12.0 and 5.14.0.

</pre><h4><b>Core</b> <b>Enhancements</b></h4><pre>
       No changes since 5.14.0.

</pre><h4><b>Security</b></h4><pre>
   <b>"Digest"</b> <b>unsafe</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>eval</b> <b>(CVE-2011-3597)</b>
       The "Digest-&gt;new()" function did not properly sanitize input before using it in an <b>eval()</b> call, which
       could lead to the injection of arbitrary Perl code.

       In order to exploit this flaw, the attacker would need to be able to set the algorithm name used, or be
       able to execute arbitrary Perl code already.

       This problem has been fixed.

   <b>Heap</b> <b>buffer</b> <b>overrun</b> <b>in</b> <b>'x'</b> <b>string</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>operator</b> <b>(CVE-2012-5195)</b>
       Poorly written perl code that allows an attacker to specify the count to perl's 'x' string repeat
       operator can already cause a memory exhaustion denial-of-service attack. A flaw in versions of perl
       before 5.15.5 can escalate that into a heap buffer overrun; coupled with versions of glibc before 2.16,
       it possibly allows the execution of arbitrary code.

       This problem has been fixed.

</pre><h4><b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.14.0. If any exist, they are bugs and reports are
       welcome.

</pre><h4><b>Deprecations</b></h4><pre>
       There have been no deprecations since 5.14.0.

</pre><h4><b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b></h4><pre>
   <b>New</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b>
       None

   <b>Updated</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b>
       •   PerlIO::scalar was updated to fix a bug in which opening a filehandle to a glob copy caused assertion
           failures (under debugging) or hangs or other erratic behaviour without debugging.

       •   ODBM_File and NDBM_File were updated to allow building on GNU/Hurd.

       •   IPC::Open3   has   been   updated   to  fix  a  regression  introduced  in  perl  5.12,  which  broke
           "IPC::Open3::open3($in, $out, $err, '-')".  [perl #95748]

       •   Digest has been upgraded from version 1.16 to 1.16_01.

           See "Security".

       •   Module::CoreList has been updated to version 2.49_04 to add data for this release.

   <b>Removed</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b>
       None

</pre><h4><b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>New</b> <b>Documentation</b>
       None

   <b>Changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Existing</b> <b>Documentation</b>
       <u>perlcheat</u>

       •   perlcheat was updated to 5.14.

</pre><h4><b>Configuration</b> <b>and</b> <b>Compilation</b></h4><pre>
       •   h2ph was updated to search correctly gcc include directories on platforms such as Debian with  multi-
           architecture support.

       •   In Configure, the test for procselfexe was refactored into a loop.

</pre><h4><b>Platform</b> <b>Support</b></h4><pre>
   <b>New</b> <b>Platforms</b>
       None

   <b>Discontinued</b> <b>Platforms</b>
       None

   <b>Platform-Specific</b> <b>Notes</b>
       FreeBSD
           The FreeBSD hints file was corrected to be compatible with FreeBSD 10.0.

       Solaris and NetBSD
           Configure was updated for "procselfexe" support on Solaris and NetBSD.

       HP-UX
           README.hpux was updated to note the existence of a broken header in HP-UX 11.00.

       Linux
           libutil is no longer used when compiling on Linux platforms, which avoids warnings being emitted.

           The  system  gcc  (rather than any other gcc which might be in the compiling user's path) is now used
           when searching for libraries such as "-lm".

       Mac OS X
           The locale tests were updated to reflect the behaviour of locales in Mountain Lion.

       GNU/Hurd
           Various build and test fixes were included for GNU/Hurd.

           LFS support was enabled in GNU/Hurd.

       NetBSD
           The NetBSD hints file was corrected to be compatible with NetBSD 6.*

</pre><h4><b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b></h4><pre>
       •   A regression has been fixed that was introduced in 5.14, in  "/i"  regular  expression  matching,  in
           which  a  match  improperly fails if the pattern is in UTF-8, the target string is not, and a Latin-1
           character precedes a character in the string that should match the pattern.  [perl #101710]

       •   In case-insensitive regular expression pattern matching, no longer on UTF-8 encoded strings does  the
           scan  for  the  start of match only look at the first possible position.  This caused matches such as
           ""f\x{FB00}" =~ /ff/i" to fail.

       •   The  sitecustomize  support  was  made  relocatableinc  aware,   so   that   -Dusesitecustomize   and
           -Duserelocatableinc may be used together.

       •   The  smartmatch  operator ("~~") was changed so that the right-hand side takes precedence during "Any
           ~~ Object" operations.

       •   A bug has been fixed in the tainting support, in which an index() operation  on  a  tainted  constant
           would cause all other constants to become tainted.  [perl #64804]

       •   A  regression  has  been  fixed  that  was  introduced in perl 5.12, whereby tainting errors were not
           correctly propagated through die().  [perl #111654]

       •   A regression has been fixed  that  was  introduced  in  perl  5.14,  in  which  "/[[:lower:]]/i"  and
           "/[[:upper:]]/i" no longer matched the opposite case.  [perl #101970]

</pre><h4><b>Acknowledgements</b></h4><pre>
       Perl   5.14.3  represents  approximately  12  months  of  development  since  Perl  5.14.2  and  contains
       approximately 2,300 lines of changes across 64 files from 22 authors.

       Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users  and  developers.
       The following people are known to have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.14.3:

       Abigail,  Andy  Dougherty,  Carl  Hayter,  Chris  'BinGOs' Williams, Dave Rolsky, David Mitchell, Dominic
       Hargreaves, Father Chrysostomos, Florian Ragwitz, H.Merijn Brand, Jilles Tjoelker, Karl Williamson,  Leon
       Timmermans, Michael G Schwern, Nicholas Clark, Niko Tyni, Pino Toscano, Ricardo Signes, Salvador Fandiño,
       Samuel Thibault, Steve Hay, Tony Cook.

       The  list  above  is  almost  certainly  incomplete as it is automatically generated from version control
       history. In particular, it does not include the names of the (very  much  appreciated)  contributors  who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many  of  the  changes  included  in this version originated in the CPAN modules included in Perl's core.
       We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for helping Perl to flourish.

       For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see the  <u>AUTHORS</u>  file  in  the
       Perl source distribution.

</pre><h4><b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  find  what  you  think  is  a  bug,  you  might  check  the  articles  recently  posted  to  the
       comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at <a href="http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/">http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/</a> .  There may  also
       be information at <a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a> , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with your release.  Be
       sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of
       "perl -V", will be sent off to <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a> to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly
       archived  mailing  list,  then  please send it to <a href="mailto:perl5-security-report@perl.org">perl5-security-report@perl.org</a>. This points to a closed
       subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able to help  assess
       the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or
       fix  the  problem  across  all  platforms  on  which  Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
       security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
