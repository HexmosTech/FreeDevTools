       guestfs-release-notes - libguestfs Release Notes

</pre><h4><b>RELEASE</b> <b>NOTES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>LIBGUESTFS</b> <b>1.48</b></h4><pre>
       These are the release notes for libguestfs stable release 1.48.  This describes the major changes since
       1.46.

       Libguestfs 1.48.0 was released on <b>14</b> <b>March</b> <b>2022</b>.

   <b>Some</b> <b>features</b> <b>removed</b>
       The following little used, experimental or unsafe features have been removed:

       "Libguestfs live" was an experimental feature that allowed you (in theory) to connect to an existing
       instance of the libguestfs daemon in a running guest.  If you want to do this we recommend installing
       qemu-guest-agent in the guest instead and using the APIs provided by it.  The related "unix:" backend has
       been removed.  The <b><a href="../man1/guestfish.1.html">guestfish</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/guestmount.1.html">guestmount</a></b>(1) <u>--live</u> option now prints an error.

       The User-mode Linux ("uml") backend has been removed.  It was an alternate hypervisor that could be used
       instead of qemu.  It had many limitations including lack of network support, and lack of qemu native
       features like qcow2 or network-backed disks.  In addition it was slower than KVM and particular features
       like bulk upload/download were painfully slow.  Also the UML feature of Linux that it was based on often
       does not work.

       The 9pfs APIs "guestfs_list_9p" and "guestfs_mount_9p" have been deprecated and now return errors.  This
       was related to an experimental feature for passing through host filesystems to the appliance.  You had to
       hand-hack the qemu command line for this to work and it did not fit the libguestfs model very well.

       "guestfs_add_drive" no longer supports hotplugging (adding a drive after launch), and
       "guestfs_remove_drive" has been deprecated and now returns an error.  Hotplugging was an unsuccessful
       feature which was complicated to implement and maintain, and was slow and insecure.  It also only worked
       with the non-default libvirt backend, and was never implemented in the default "direct" backend.

   <b>Language</b> <b>bindings</b>
       Fix allocation and deallocation of string lists in golang bindings (Laszlo Ersek).

       Multiple fixes to the OCaml bindings: Fix warnings, move minimum version to OCaml 4.04, replace various
       deprecated OCaml features with modern OCaml features.

       Running "make distclean" in the <u>rust</u> directory now completely cleans the cargo temporary files.

   <b>Inspection</b>
       Fix inspection of modern Pardus GNU/Linux (Laszlo Ersek).

       Add support for Kylin (Laszlo Ersek).

       Add support for Rocky Linux (Neil Hanlon).

       Inspection of guests which use LUKS encryption on top of LVM logical volumes should now work (Laszlo
       Ersek).

   <b>API</b>
       <u>New</u> <u>APIs</u>

       No new APIs were added in libguestfs 1.48.

       <u>Other</u> <u>API</u> <u>changes</u>

       "guestfs_list_9p" and "guestfs_mount_9p" are deprecated and now return errors.

       "guestfs_remove_drive" has been deprecated and now returns an error.

       In "guestfs_xfs_admin" the "lazycounter" parameter is deprecated because it is no longer supported in
       recent versions of XFS.

       Partition APIs now cope with the broken MBR partition tables created by dosfstools ≥ 4.2 (Laszlo Ersek).

       In "guestfs_md_create" the "chunk" parameter should not be used with RAID 1.  Previously it was allowed
       but ignored, but now it will give an error (Laszlo Ersek).

   <b>Build</b> <b>changes</b>
       Multiple compiler warnings fixed and/or analyzed and suppressed (Laszlo Ersek).

       Fix detection of optional Yara library using pkg-config instead of checking for library/header file
       (Laszlo Ersek).

       Update valgrind suppressions for glibc 2.35, OCaml 4.13 and libvirt 7.7.  "make check-valgrind" works
       again.

       If using libvirt ≥ 3.8.0, we now use &lt;interface&gt; to create the appliance network interface instead of
       adding qemu command line parameters (Laszlo Ersek).

       The <b><a href="../man1/guestfs-release-notes.1.html">guestfs-release-notes</a></b>(1) page was a broken link, but it has now been restored as a new page that
       links to the release notes from each stable release.

   <b>Internals</b>
       The libc API <b><a href="../man3/strerror_r.3.html">strerror_r</a></b>(3) is difficult to use correctly because of differing signatures in glibc and
       other libc.  A wrapper "guestfs_int_strerror" has been created to hide the differences.
