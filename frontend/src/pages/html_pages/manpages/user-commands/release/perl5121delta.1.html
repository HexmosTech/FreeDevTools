</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl5121delta - what is new for perl v5.12.1

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.12.0 release and the 5.12.1 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.10.1, first read perl5120delta, which describes
       differences between 5.10.0 and 5.12.0.

</pre><h4><b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.12.0. If any incompatibilities with 5.12.0 exist,
       they are bugs. Please report them.

</pre><h4><b>Core</b> <b>Enhancements</b></h4><pre>
       Other than the bug fixes listed below, there should be no user-visible changes to the core language in
       this release.

</pre><h4><b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Pragmata</b> <b>Changes</b>
       •   We fixed exporting of "is_strict" and "is_lax" from version.

           These  were  being  exported  with  a wrapper that treated them as method calls, which caused them to
           fail.  They are just functions, are documented as such, and should never be subclassed, so this patch
           just exports them directly as functions without the wrapper.

   <b>Updated</b> <b>Modules</b>
       •   We upgraded CGI to version 3.49 to incorporate fixes for regressions introduced  in  the  release  we
           shipped with Perl 5.12.0.

       •   We upgraded Pod::Simple to version 3.14 to get an improvement to \C\&lt;\&lt; \&gt;\&gt; parsing.

       •   We made a small fix to the CPANPLUS test suite to fix an occasional spurious test failure.

       •   We upgraded Safe to version 2.27 to wrap coderefs returned by reval() and rdo().

</pre><h4><b>Changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Existing</b> <b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
       •   We added the new maintenance release policy to perlpolicy

       •   We've clarified the multiple-angle-bracket construct in the spec for POD in perlpodspec

       •   We added a missing explanation for a warning about ":=" to perldiag

       •   We removed a false claim in perlunitut that all text strings are Unicode strings in Perl.

       •   We updated the GitHub mirror link in perlrepository to mirrors/perl, not github/perl

       •   We fixed a minor error in perl5114delta.

       •   We replaced a mention of the now-obsolete Switch with <u>given</u>/<u>when</u>.

       •   We improved documentation about <u>$sitelibexp/sitecustomize.pl</u> in perlrun.

       •   We corrected perlmodlib which had unintentionally omitted a number of modules.

       •   We updated the documentation for 'require' in perlfunc relating to putting Perl code in @INC.

       •   We reinstated some erroneously-removed documentation about quotemeta in perlfunc.

       •   We fixed an <u>a2p</u> example in perlutil.

       •   We filled in a blank in perlport with the release date of Perl 5.12.

       •   We fixed broken links in a number of perldelta files.

       •   The  documentation  for Carp incorrectly stated that the $Carp::Verbose variable makes cluck generate
           stack backtraces.

       •   We fixed a number of typos in Pod::Functions

       •   We improved documentation of case-changing functions in perlfunc

       •   We corrected perlgpl to contain the correct version of the GNU General Public License.

</pre><h4><b>Testing</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Testing</b> <b>Improvements</b>
       •   <u>t/op/sselect.t</u> is now less prone to clock jitter during timing checks on Windows.

           <b>sleep()</b> time on Win32 may be rounded down to multiple of the clock tick interval.

       •   <u>lib/blib.t</u> and <u>lib/locale.t</u>: Fixes for test failures on Darwin/PPC

       •   <u>perl5db.t</u>: Fix for test failures when "Term::ReadLine::Gnu" is installed.

</pre><h4><b>Installation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Configuration</b> <b>Improvements</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Configuration</b> <b>improvements</b>
       •   We updated <u>INSTALL</u> with notes about how to deal with broken <u>dbm.h</u> on  OpenSUSE  (and  possibly  other
           platforms)

</pre><h4><b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b></h4><pre>
       •   A bug in how we process filetest operations could cause a segfault.  Filetests don't always expect an
           op  on  the  stack,  so  we now use TOPs only if we're sure that we're not stat'ing the _ filehandle.
           This is indicated by OPf_KIDS (as checked in ck_ftst).

           See also: &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/10335&gt;

       •   When deparsing a nextstate op that has both a change of package (relative to the previous  nextstate)
           and  a label, the package declaration is now emitted first, because it is syntactically impermissible
           for a label to prefix a package declaration.

       •   XSUB.h now correctly redefines fgets under PERL_IMPLICIT_SYS

           See also: &lt;<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html">http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html</a>?id=55049&gt;

       •   utf8::is_utf8 now respects GMAGIC (e.g. $1)

       •   XS code using fputc() or fputs(): on Windows could cause  an  error  due  to  their  arguments  being
           swapped.

           See also: &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/10156&gt;

       •   We  fixed  a small bug in <b>lex_stuff_pvn()</b> that caused spurious syntax errors in an obscure situation.
           It happened when stuffing was performed on the last line  of  a  file  and  the  line  ended  with  a
           statement that lacked a terminating semicolon.

           See also: &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/10273&gt;

       •   We fixed a bug that could cause \N{} constructs followed by a single . to be parsed incorrectly.

           See also: &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/10367&gt;

       •   We fixed a bug that caused when(scalar) without an argument not to be treated as a syntax error.

           See also: &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/10287&gt;

       •   We  fixed  a regression in the handling of labels immediately before string evals that was introduced
           in Perl 5.12.0.

           See also: &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/10301&gt;

       •   We fixed a regression in case-insensitive  matching  of  folded  characters  in  regular  expressions
           introduced in Perl 5.10.1.

           See also: &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/10193&gt;

</pre><h4><b>Platform</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Notes</b></h4><pre>
   <b>HP-UX</b>
       •   Perl now allows -Duse64bitint without promoting to use64bitall on HP-UX

   <b>AIX</b>
       •   Perl now builds on AIX 4.2

           The  changes  required  work around AIX 4.2s' lack of support for IPv6, and limited support for POSIX
           sigaction().

   <b>FreeBSD</b> <b>7</b>
       •   FreeBSD 7 no longer contains <u>/usr/bin/objformat</u>. At build time, Perl now skips  the  <u>objformat</u>  check
           for versions 7 and higher and assumes ELF.

   <b>VMS</b>
       •   It's now possible to build extensions on older (pre 7.3-2) VMS systems.

           DCL  symbol  length  was  limited  to  1K  up  until  about  seven  years or so ago, but there was no
           particularly deep reason to prevent those older systems from configuring and building Perl.

       •   We fixed the previously-broken "-Uuseperlio" build on VMS.

           We were checking a variable that doesn't exist in the non-default case of disabling perlio.   Now  we
           only look at it when it exists.

       •   We fixed the -Uuseperlio command-line option in configure.com.

           Formerly  it  only worked if you went through all the questions interactively and explicitly answered
           no.

</pre><h4><b>Known</b> <b>Problems</b></h4><pre>
       •   "List::Util::first" misbehaves in the presence of a lexical $_ (typically introduced by  "my  $_"  or
           implicitly  by  "given").  The variable which gets set for each iteration is the package variable $_,
           not the lexical $_.

           A similar issue may occur in other modules that provide functions which take a block as  their  first
           argument, like

               foo { ... $_ ...} list

           See also: &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/9798&gt;

       •   "Module::Load::Conditional"  and "version" have an unfortunate interaction which can cause "CPANPLUS"
           to crash when it encounters an  unparseable  version  string.   Upgrading  to  "CPANPLUS"  0.9004  or
           "Module::Load::Conditional" 0.38 from CPAN will resolve this issue.

</pre><h4><b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  find  what  you  think  is  a  bug,  you  might  check  the  articles  recently  posted  to  the
       comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at <a href="http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/">http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/</a> .  There may  also
       be information at <a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a> , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the <b>perlbug</b> program included with your release.  Be
       sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of
       "perl -V", will be sent off to <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a> to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly
       archived  mailing  list,  then  please send it to <a href="mailto:perl5-security-report@perl.org">perl5-security-report@perl.org</a>. This points to a closed
       subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be  able  to  help
       assess  the  impact  of  issues,  figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to
       mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address
       for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
