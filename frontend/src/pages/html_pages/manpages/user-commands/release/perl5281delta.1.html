</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl5281delta - what is new for perl v5.28.1

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.28.0 release and the 5.28.1 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.26.0, first read perl5280delta, which describes
       differences between 5.26.0 and 5.28.0.

</pre><h4><b>Security</b></h4><pre>
   <b>[CVE-2018-18311]</b> <b>Integer</b> <b>overflow</b> <b>leading</b> <b>to</b> <b>buffer</b> <b>overflow</b> <b>and</b> <b>segmentation</b> <b>fault</b>
       Integer arithmetic in Perl_my_setenv() could wrap when the combined length of the environment variable
       name and value exceeded around 0x7fffffff.  This could lead to writing beyond the end of an allocated
       buffer with attacker supplied data.

       [GH #16560] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16560&gt;

   <b>[CVE-2018-18312]</b> <b>Heap-buffer-overflow</b> <b>write</b> <b>in</b> <b>S_regatom</b> <b>(regcomp.c)</b>
       A crafted regular expression could cause heap-buffer-overflow write during compilation, potentially
       allowing arbitrary code execution.

       [GH #16649] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16649&gt;

</pre><h4><b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.28.0.  If any exist, they are bugs, and we request
       that you submit a report.  See "Reporting Bugs" below.

</pre><h4><b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Updated</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b>
       •   Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 5.20180622 to 5.20181129_28.

</pre><h4><b>Selected</b> <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b></h4><pre>
       •   Perl  5.28  introduced an index() optimization when comparing to -1 (or indirectly, e.g. &gt;= 0).  When
           this optimization was triggered inside a "when" clause  it  caused  a  warning  ("Argument  %s  isn't
           numeric     in     smart     match").      This     has     now     been    fixed.     [GH    #16626]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16626&gt;

       •   Matching of decimal digits in script runs, introduced in Perl 5.28, had a bug that led  to  "1\N{THAI
           DIGIT FIVE}" matching "/^(*sr:\d+)$/" when it should not.  This has now been fixed.

       •   The    new    in-place   editing   code   no   longer   leaks   directory   handles.    [GH   #16602]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16602&gt;

</pre><h4><b>Acknowledgements</b></h4><pre>
       Perl 5.28.1 represents approximately 5 months of development since Perl 5.28.0 and contains approximately
       6,100 lines of changes across 44 files from 12 authors.

       Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were approximately  700  lines  of
       changes to 12 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

       Perl  continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and developers.
       The following people are known to have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.28.1:

       Aaron Crane, Abigail, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsåker, David Mitchell, James E  Keenan,
       John SJ Anderson, Karen Etheridge, Karl Williamson, Sawyer X, Steve Hay, Tony Cook.

       The  list  above  is  almost  certainly  incomplete as it is automatically generated from version control
       history.  In particular, it does not include the names of the (very much  appreciated)  contributors  who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many  of  the  changes  included  in this version originated in the CPAN modules included in Perl's core.
       We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for helping Perl to flourish.

       For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see the  <u>AUTHORS</u>  file  in  the
       Perl source distribution.

</pre><h4><b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  find  what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database at &lt;https://rt.perl.org/&gt; .
       There may also be information at &lt;<a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a>&gt; , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with your release.  Be
       sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of
       "perl -V", will be sent off to <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a> to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it inappropriate to send to a  publicly
       archived  mailing  list,  then see "SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION" in perlsec for details of
       how to report the issue.

</pre><h4><b>Give</b> <b>Thanks</b></h4><pre>
       If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5, you can do so by running  the
       "perlthanks" program:

           perlthanks

       This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of thanks.
