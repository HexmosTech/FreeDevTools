</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       guestfs-release-notes - libguestfs Release Notes

</pre><h4><b>RELEASE</b> <b>NOTES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>LIBGUESTFS</b> <b>1.8</b></h4><pre>
       These release notes only cover the differences from the previous stable/dev branch split (1.6.0).  For
       detailed changelogs, please see the git repository, or the ChangeLog file distributed in the tarball.

   <b>New</b> <b>features</b>
        - Support and packages for Debian and Ubuntu.

        - Daily builds from git repository on Debian and Ubuntu to reduce risk
          of regressions.

        - Port to ArchLinux 'pacman' (thanks Thomas S Hatch).

        - The following tools have been rewritten in C (originally in Perl):

            . virt-cat
            . virt-df
            . virt-inspector
            . virt-ls
            . virt-rescue

        - Some C tools support encrypted guests automatically.  This is
          supported in: guestfish, guestmount, virt-cat, virt-inspector,
          virt-ls.

        - New tool virt-filesystems (in C) which is a replacement for
          virt-list-filesystems and virt-list-partitions, and has a superset
          of the functionality of those tools.

        - guestfish, guestmount and the C tools use unified command line option
          parsing, so they support many common options such as '-a disk.img',
          '-d libvirt-domain', '-x', '-v'.  The old command line option
          parsing is preserved for compatibility in scripts etc.

        - guestfish no longer has any dependencies on Perl

        - New man pages containing programming examples: <a href="../man3/guestfs-examples.3.html">guestfs-examples</a>(3) (C/C++),
          <a href="../man3/guestfs-ocaml.3.html">guestfs-ocaml</a>(3), <a href="../man3/guestfs-python.3.html">guestfs-python</a>(3), <a href="../man3/guestfs-ruby.3.html">guestfs-ruby</a>(3).

        - Trace mode prints return values from API functions.

        - virt-inspector can list applications installed in Windows guests, along
          with a great deal of information about those applications.

        - Add support for inspecting: Linux Mint, Mandriva, FreeBSD.

        - guestfish --rw option (with no effect currently) to make potentially
          dangerous write access explicit.

        - guestfish --listen --csh for compatibility with csh, tcsh (thanks
          Eric Blake).

        - The first upstream version that introduced each API function is now
          documented in <a href="../man3/guestfs.3.html">guestfs</a>(3).

        - guestfs_last_errno allows you to retrieve the errno from the
          daemon, correctly translated to the local operating system.

        - Functions can now have optional parameters.

        - Progress bars and progress notifications can now happen for upload
          commands.

        - Appliance builder more careful about not leaving temporary files
          around in /tmp.

        - getfattr/setfattr commands added to virt-rescue.

        - ROADMAP file covers roadmap and goals for future releases.

   <b>Security</b>
        - New SECURITY section in <a href="../man3/guestfs.3.html">guestfs</a>(3) API documentation.

        - virt-inspector no longer runs any guest commands.

        - Inspection code is more careful about avoiding very large files
          from guests which might previously have caused a denial of service.

        - FUSE calls into guestmount are now traced when using guestmount -x.

   <b>New</b> <b>APIs</b>
        - add-domain
        - add-drive-opts
        - getxattr
        - inspect-get-hostname
        - inspect-get-package-format
        - inspect-get-package-management
        - inspect-get-roots
        - inspect-list-applications
        - lgetxattr
        - mkfs-opts

   <b>Internals</b>
        - C programs now only link precisely with the libraries that they use.

        - PCRE, libmagic, hivex and libvirt libraries are now completely
          optional for building.

        - Multiple memory leaks and file descriptor leaks fixed.

        - Add a POD wrapper to unify generation of man pages and HTML files
          across all programs.

        - Source includes phony images of Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu and
          Windows guests.

        - Ruby bindings have 'make install' rule.

        - &lt;guestfs.h&gt; is now a single file.

        - &lt;guestfs.h&gt; does not require XDR headers.

        - ocaml xml-light library is no longer required to build (thanks
          Maxim Koltsov).

        - ./configure --disable-[...] for each language binding (thanks
          Maxim Koltsov).

        - Old ocaml-viewer program removed (use guestfs-browser instead).

        - New C API test type 'InitScratchFS' makes the tests run a little
          more quickly.

        - Excluded packages in the appliance are now listed in a separate
          file appliance/excludelist.in, and can be customized per-distro.

   <b>Bugs</b> <b>fixed</b>
        - 663407 readlink and readlinklist returns /sysroot/ in some paths
        - 661280 virt-rescue: panic when shutting down: "<a href="file:/sbin/reboot">/sbin/reboot</a>: No such file or directory"
        - 657499 checksum: wrong check sum type causes umount to fail
        - 655554 Whole disk paths are not made canonical by virt-inspector
        - 654638 openssl updated to 1.0.0b libguestfs depends on exact file names
        - 652796 ruby bindings not installed by 'make install', hence omitted from the binary distribution
