</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl5244delta - what is new for perl v5.24.4

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.24.3 release and the 5.24.4 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.24.2, first read perl5243delta, which describes
       differences between 5.24.2 and 5.24.3.

</pre><h4><b>Security</b></h4><pre>
   <b>[CVE-2018-6797]</b> <b>heap-buffer-overflow</b> <b>(WRITE</b> <b>of</b> <b>size</b> <b>1)</b> <b>in</b> <b>S_regatom</b> <b>(regcomp.c)</b>
       A crafted regular expression could cause a heap buffer write overflow, with control over the bytes
       written.  [GH #16185] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16185&gt;

   <b>[CVE-2018-6798]</b> <b>Heap-buffer-overflow</b> <b>in</b> <b>Perl__byte_dump_string</b> <b>(utf8.c)</b>
       Matching a crafted locale dependent regular expression could cause a heap buffer read overflow and
       potentially information disclosure.  [GH #16143] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16143&gt;

   <b>[CVE-2018-6913]</b> <b>heap-buffer-overflow</b> <b>in</b> <b>S_pack_rec</b>
       pack() could cause a heap buffer write overflow with a large item count.  [GH #16098]
       &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16098&gt;

   <b>Assertion</b> <b>failure</b> <b>in</b> <b>Perl__core_swash_init</b> <b>(utf8.c)</b>
       Control characters in a supposed Unicode property name could cause perl to crash.  This has been fixed.

       &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=132658&gt;

</pre><h4><b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.24.3.  If any exist, they are bugs, and we request
       that you submit a report.  See "Reporting Bugs" below.

</pre><h4><b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Updated</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b>
       •   Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 5.20170922_24 to 5.20180414_24.

</pre><h4><b>Selected</b> <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b></h4><pre>
       •   The  readpipe()  built-in  function  now  checks  at  compile  time  that  it  has only one parameter
           expression, and puts it in scalar context, thus  ensuring  that  it  doesn't  corrupt  the  stack  at
           runtime.  [GH #2793] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/2793&gt;

</pre><h4><b>Acknowledgements</b></h4><pre>
       Perl 5.24.4 represents approximately 7 months of development since Perl 5.24.3 and contains approximately
       2,400 lines of changes across 49 files from 12 authors.

       Excluding  auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were approximately 1,300 lines of
       changes to 12 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

       Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users  and  developers.
       The following people are known to have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.24.4:

       Abigail,  Chris  'BinGOs'  Williams,  John  SJ Anderson, Karen Etheridge, Karl Williamson, Renee Baecker,
       Sawyer X, Steve Hay, Todd Rinaldo, Tony Cook, Yves Orton, Zefram.

       The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it  is  automatically  generated  from  version  control
       history.   In  particular,  it does not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN  modules  included  in  Perl's  core.
       We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for helping Perl to flourish.

       For  a  more  complete  list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see the <u>AUTHORS</u> file in the
       Perl source distribution.

</pre><h4><b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  find  what  you  think  is  a  bug,  you  might  check  the  articles  recently  posted  to  the
       comp.lang.perl.misc  newsgroup  and  the perl bug database at &lt;https://rt.perl.org/&gt; .  There may also be
       information at &lt;<a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a>&gt; , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with your release.  Be
       sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of
       "perl -V", will be sent off to <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a> to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it inappropriate to send to a  publicly
       archived  mailing  list,  then see "SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION" in perlsec for details of
       how to report the issue.
