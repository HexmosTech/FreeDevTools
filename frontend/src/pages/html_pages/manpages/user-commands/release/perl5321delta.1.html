</pre><h4><b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>New</b> <b>Documentation</b>
       <u>perlgov</u>

       Documentation of the newly formed rules of governance for Perl.

       <u>perlsecpolicy</u>

       Documentation of how the Perl security team operates and how the team evaluates new security reports.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Existing</b> <b>Documentation</b>
       We  have  attempted  to  update the documentation to reflect the changes listed in this document.  If you
       find any we have missed, open an issue at &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues&gt;.

       Additionally, the following selected changes have been made:

       <u>perlop</u>

       •   Document range op behaviour change.

</pre><h4><b>Diagnostics</b></h4><pre>
       The following additions or changes have been made to diagnostic  output,  including  warnings  and  fatal
       error messages.  For the complete list of diagnostic messages, see perldiag.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Existing</b> <b>Diagnostics</b>
       •   \K not permitted in lookahead/lookbehind in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/

           This error was incorrectly produced in some cases involving nested lookarounds.  This has been fixed.

           [GH #18123 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18123&gt;]

</pre><h4><b>Configuration</b> <b>and</b> <b>Compilation</b></h4><pre>
       •   Newer 64-bit versions of the Intel C/C++ compiler are now recognized and have the correct flags set.

       •   We now trap SIGBUS when <u>Configure</u> checks for "va_copy".

           On  several  systems  the  attempt  to  determine if we need "va_copy" or similar results in a SIGBUS
           instead of the expected SIGSEGV, which previously caused a core dump.

           [GH #18148 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18148&gt;]

</pre><h4><b>Testing</b></h4><pre>
       Tests were added and changed to reflect the other additions and changes in this release.

           The hints file for darwin has been updated to handle future macOS versions beyond 10.  Perl  can  now
           be built on macOS Big Sur.

</pre><h4><b>Acknowledgements</b></h4><pre>
       Perl 5.32.1 represents approximately 7 months of development since Perl 5.32.0 and contains approximately
       7,000 lines of changes across 80 files from 23 authors.

       Excluding  auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were approximately 1,300 lines of
       changes to 23 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

       Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and  developers.
       The following people are known to have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.32.1:

       Adam  Hartley,  Andy  Dougherty,  Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsåker, Dan Book, David Mitchell, Graham Knop, Graham
       Ollis, Hauke D, H.Merijn Brand, Hugo van der Sanden, John Lightsey,  Karen  Etheridge,  Karl  Williamson,
       Leon Timmermans, Max Maischein, Nicolas R., Ricardo Signes, Richard Leach, Sawyer X, Sevan Janiyan, Steve
       Hay, Tom Hukins, Tony Cook.

       The  list  above  is  almost  certainly  incomplete as it is automatically generated from version control
       history.  In particular, it does not include the names of the (very much  appreciated)  contributors  who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many  of  the  changes  included  in this version originated in the CPAN modules included in Perl's core.
       We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for helping Perl to flourish.

       For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see the  <u>AUTHORS</u>  file  in  the
       Perl source distribution.

</pre><h4><b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       If   you   find   what   you   think   is   a   bug,   you   might   check   the  perl  bug  database  at
       &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues&gt;.  There may also be  information  at  &lt;<a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a>&gt;,  the
       Perl Home Page.

       If     you     believe     you    have    an    unreported    bug,    please    open    an    issue    at
       &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues&gt;.  Be sure to trim your bug down to  a  tiny  but  sufficient  test
       case.

       If  the  bug  you are reporting has security implications which make it inappropriate to send to a public
       issue tracker, then see "SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION" in perlsec for  details  of  how  to
       report the issue.

</pre><h4><b>Give</b> <b>Thanks</b></h4><pre>
