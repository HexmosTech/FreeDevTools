</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl5263delta - what is new for perl v5.26.3

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.26.2 release and the 5.26.3 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.26.1, first read perl5262delta, which describes
       differences between 5.26.1 and 5.26.2.

</pre><h4><b>Security</b></h4><pre>
   <b>[CVE-2018-12015]</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>traversal</b> <b>in</b> <b>module</b> <b>Archive::Tar</b>
       By default, Archive::Tar doesn't allow extracting files outside the current working directory.  However,
       this secure extraction mode could be bypassed by putting a symlink and a regular file with the same name
       into the tar file.

       [GH #16580] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16580&gt; [cpan #125523]
       &lt;https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125523&gt;

   <b>[CVE-2018-18311]</b> <b>Integer</b> <b>overflow</b> <b>leading</b> <b>to</b> <b>buffer</b> <b>overflow</b> <b>and</b> <b>segmentation</b> <b>fault</b>
       Integer arithmetic in Perl_my_setenv() could wrap when the combined length of the environment variable
       name and value exceeded around 0x7fffffff.  This could lead to writing beyond the end of an allocated
       buffer with attacker supplied data.

       [GH #16560] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16560&gt;

   <b>[CVE-2018-18312]</b> <b>Heap-buffer-overflow</b> <b>write</b> <b>in</b> <b>S_regatom</b> <b>(regcomp.c)</b>
       A crafted regular expression could cause heap-buffer-overflow write during compilation, potentially
       allowing arbitrary code execution.

       [GH #16649] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16649&gt;

   <b>[CVE-2018-18313]</b> <b>Heap-buffer-overflow</b> <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>S_grok_bslash_N</b> <b>(regcomp.c)</b>
       A crafted regular expression could cause heap-buffer-overflow read during compilation, potentially
       leading to sensitive information being leaked.

       [GH #16554] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16554&gt;

   <b>[CVE-2018-18314]</b> <b>Heap-buffer-overflow</b> <b>write</b> <b>in</b> <b>S_regatom</b> <b>(regcomp.c)</b>
       A crafted regular expression could cause heap-buffer-overflow write during compilation, potentially
       allowing arbitrary code execution.

       [GH #16041] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16041&gt;

</pre><h4><b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.26.2.  If any exist, they are bugs, and we request
       that you submit a report.  See "Reporting Bugs" below.

</pre><h4><b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Updated</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b>
       •   Archive::Tar has been upgraded from version 2.24 to 2.24_01.

       •   Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 5.20180414_26 to 5.20181129_26.

</pre><h4><b>Diagnostics</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  additions  or  changes  have been made to diagnostic output, including warnings and fatal
       error messages.  For the complete list of diagnostic messages, see perldiag.

   <b>New</b> <b>Diagnostics</b>
       <u>New</u> <u>Errors</u>

       •   Unexpected ']' with no following ')' in (?[... in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/

           (F) While parsing an extended character class a ']' character was  encountered  at  a  point  in  the
           definition  where  the  only legal use of ']' is to close the character class definition as part of a
           '])', you may have forgotten the close paren, or otherwise confused the parser.

       •   Expecting close paren for nested extended charclass in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/

           (F) While parsing a nested extended character class like:

               (?[ ... (?flags:(?[ ... ])) ... ])
                                        ^

           we expected to see a close paren ')' (marked by ^) but did not.

       •   Expecting close paren for wrapper for nested extended charclass in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/

           (F) While parsing a nested extended character class like:

               (?[ ... (?flags:(?[ ... ])) ... ])
                                         ^

           we expected to see a close paren ')' (marked by ^) but did not.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Existing</b> <b>Diagnostics</b>
       •   Syntax error in (?[...]) in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/

           This fatal error message has been slightly expanded (from "Syntax error in (?[...]) in regex  m/%s/")
           for greater clarity.

</pre><h4><b>Acknowledgements</b></h4><pre>
       Perl 5.26.3 represents approximately 8 months of development since Perl 5.26.2 and contains approximately
       4,500 lines of changes across 51 files from 15 authors.

       Excluding  auto-generated  files,  documentation and release tools, there were approximately 770 lines of
       changes to 10 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

       Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users  and  developers.
       The following people are known to have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.26.3:

       Aaron  Crane, Abigail, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsåker, David Mitchell, H.Merijn Brand,
       James E Keenan, John SJ Anderson, Karen Etheridge, Karl Williamson, Sawyer X, Steve  Hay,  Todd  Rinaldo,
       Tony Cook, Yves Orton.

       The  list  above  is  almost  certainly  incomplete as it is automatically generated from version control
       history.  In particular, it does not include the names of the (very much  appreciated)  contributors  who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many  of  the  changes  included  in this version originated in the CPAN modules included in Perl's core.
       We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for helping Perl to flourish.

       For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see the  <u>AUTHORS</u>  file  in  the
       Perl source distribution.

</pre><h4><b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  find  what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database at &lt;https://rt.perl.org/&gt; .
       There may also be information at &lt;<a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a>&gt; , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with your release.  Be
       sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of
       "perl -V", will be sent off to <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a> to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it inappropriate to send to a  publicly
       archived  mailing  list,  then see "SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION" in perlsec for details of
       how to report the issue.

</pre><h4><b>Give</b> <b>Thanks</b></h4><pre>
       If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5, you can do so by running  the
       "perlthanks" program:

           perlthanks

       This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of thanks.
