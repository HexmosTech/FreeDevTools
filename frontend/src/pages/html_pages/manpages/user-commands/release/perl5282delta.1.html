</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl5282delta - what is new for perl v5.28.2

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.28.1 release and the 5.28.2 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.28.0, first read perl5281delta, which describes
       differences between 5.28.0 and 5.28.1.

</pre><h4><b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Any</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>digits</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Common</b> <b>script</b> <b>are</b> <b>legal</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>script</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> <b>another</b> <b>script</b>
       There are several sets of digits in the Common script.  "[0-9]" is the most familiar.  But there are also
       "[\x{FF10}-\x{FF19}]" (FULLWIDTH DIGIT ZERO - FULLWIDTH DIGIT NINE), and several sets for use in
       mathematical notation, such as the MATHEMATICAL DOUBLE-STRUCK DIGITs.  Any of these sets should be able
       to appear in script runs of, say, Greek.  But the previous design overlooked all but the ASCII digits
       "[0-9]", so the design was flawed.  This has been fixed, so is both a bug fix and an incompatibility.

       All digits in a run still have to come from the same set of ten digits.

       [GH #16704] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16704&gt;

</pre><h4><b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Updated</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b>
       •   Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 5.20181129_28 to 5.20190419.

       •   PerlIO::scalar has been upgraded from version 0.29 to 0.30.

       •   Storable has been upgraded from version 3.08 to 3.08_01.

</pre><h4><b>Platform</b> <b>Support</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Platform-Specific</b> <b>Notes</b>
       Windows
           The  Windows  Server  2003  SP1  Platform  SDK  build,  with  its  early  x64 compiler and tools, was
           accidentally broken in Perl 5.27.9.  This has now been fixed.

       Mac OS X
           Perl's build and testing process on Mac OS X for "-Duseshrplib" builds is now compatible with Mac  OS
           X System Integrity Protection (SIP).

           SIP  prevents  binaries  in  <u><a href="file:/bin">/bin</a></u>  (and  a  few  other  places)  being passed the "DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH"
           environment variable.  For our purposes this prevents "DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH" from being  passed  to  the
           shell,  which  prevents that variable being passed to the testing or build process, so running "perl"
           couldn't find <u>libperl.dylib</u>.

           To work around that, the initial build of the <u>perl</u> executable expects to find  <u>libperl.dylib</u>  in  the
           build  directory, and the library path is then adjusted during installation to point to the installed
           library.

           [GH #15057] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15057&gt;

</pre><h4><b>Selected</b> <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b></h4><pre>
       •   If an in-place edit is still in progress during global destruction and  the  process  exit  code  (as
           stored  in $?) is zero, perl will now treat the in-place edit as successful, replacing the input file
           with any output produced.

           This allows code like:

             perl -i -ne 'print "Foo"; last'

           to replace the input file, while code like:

             perl -i -ne 'print "Foo"; die'

           will not.  Partly resolves [perl #133659].

           [GH #16748] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16748&gt;

       •   A regression in Perl 5.28 caused the following code to fail

            close(STDIN); open(CHILD, "|wc -l")'

           because the child's stdin would be closed on exec.  This has now been fixed.

       •   "pack "u", "invalid uuencoding"" now properly NUL terminates the zero-length SV produced.

           [GH #16343] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16343&gt;

       •   Failing to compile a format now aborts compilation.  Like other errors in sub-parses this could leave
           the parser in a strange state, possibly crashing perl if compilation continued.

           [GH #16169] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16169&gt;

       •   See "Any set of digits in the Common script are legal in a script run of another script".

</pre><h4><b>Acknowledgements</b></h4><pre>
       Perl 5.28.2 represents approximately 4 months of development since Perl 5.28.1 and contains approximately
       2,500 lines of changes across 75 files from 13 authors.

       Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were approximately 1,200 lines  of
       changes to 29 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

       Perl  continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and developers.
       The following people are known to have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.28.2:

       Aaron Crane, Abigail, Andy Dougherty, David Mitchell, Karen Etheridge, Karl Williamson, Leon  Timmermans,
       Nicolas R., Sawyer X, Steve Hay, Tina Müller, Tony Cook, Zak B. Elep.

       The  list  above  is  almost  certainly  incomplete as it is automatically generated from version control
       history.  In particular, it does not include the names of the (very much  appreciated)  contributors  who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many  of  the  changes  included  in this version originated in the CPAN modules included in Perl's core.
       We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for helping Perl to flourish.

       For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see the  <u>AUTHORS</u>  file  in  the
       Perl source distribution.

</pre><h4><b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  find  what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database at &lt;https://rt.perl.org/&gt; .
       There may also be information at &lt;<a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a>&gt; , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with your release.  Be
       sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of
       "perl -V", will be sent off to <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a> to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it inappropriate to send to a  publicly
       archived  mailing  list,  then see "SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION" in perlsec for details of
       how to report the issue.

</pre><h4><b>Give</b> <b>Thanks</b></h4><pre>
       If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5, you can do so by running  the
       "perlthanks" program:

           perlthanks

       This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of thanks.
