</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl5124delta - what is new for perl v5.12.4

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.12.3 release and the 5.12.4 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.12.2, first read perl5123delta, which describes
       differences between 5.12.2 and 5.12.3. The major changes made in 5.12.0 are described in perl5120delta.

</pre><h4><b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.12.3. If any exist, they are bugs and reports are
       welcome.

</pre><h4><b>Selected</b> <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b></h4><pre>
       When strict "refs" mode is off, "%{...}" in rvalue context returns "undef" if its argument is undefined.
       An optimisation introduced in Perl 5.12.0 to make "keys %{...}" faster when used as a boolean did not
       take this into account, causing "keys %{+undef}" (and "keys %$foo" when $foo is undefined) to be an
       error, which it should be so in strict mode only [perl #81750].

       "lc", "uc", "lcfirst", and "ucfirst" no longer return untainted strings when the argument is tainted.
       This has been broken since perl 5.8.9 [perl #87336].

       Fixed a case where it was possible that a freed buffer may have been read from when parsing a here
       document.

</pre><h4><b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b></h4><pre>
       Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 2.43 to 2.50.

</pre><h4><b>Testing</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>cpan/CGI/t/http.t</u> test script has been fixed to work when the environment has HTTPS_* environment
       variables, such as HTTPS_PROXY.

</pre><h4><b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
       Updated the documentation for <b>rand()</b> in perlfunc to note that it is not cryptographically secure.

</pre><h4><b>Platform</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Notes</b></h4><pre>
       Linux
           Support Ubuntu 11.04's new multi-arch library layout.

</pre><h4><b>Acknowledgements</b></h4><pre>
       Perl 5.12.4 represents approximately 5 months of development since Perl 5.12.3 and contains approximately
       200 lines of changes across 11 files from 8 authors.

       Perl  continues  to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and developers.
       The following people are known to have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.12.4:

</pre><h4><b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  find  what  you  think  is  a  bug,  you  might  check  the  articles  recently  posted  to  the
       comp.lang.perl.misc  newsgroup and the perl bug database at <a href="http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/">http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/</a> .  There may also
       be information at <a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a> , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the <b>perlbug</b> program included with your release.  Be
       sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of
       "perl -V", will be sent off to <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a> to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly
       archived mailing list, then please send it to <a href="mailto:perl5-security-report@perl.org">perl5-security-report@perl.org</a>. This  points  to  a  closed
       subscription  unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able to help assess
       the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or
       fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl  is  supported.  Please  only  use  this  address  for
       security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
