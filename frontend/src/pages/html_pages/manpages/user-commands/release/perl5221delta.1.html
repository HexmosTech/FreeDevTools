</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl5221delta - what is new for perl v5.22.1

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.22.0 release and the 5.22.1 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.20.0, first read perl5220delta, which describes
       differences between 5.20.0 and 5.22.0.

</pre><h4><b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.20.0 other than the following single exception,
       which we deemed to be a sensible change to make in order to get the new "\b{wb}" and (in particular)
       "\b{sb}" features sane before people decided they're worthless because of bugs in their Perl 5.22.0
       implementation and avoided them in the future.  If any others exist, they are bugs, and we request that
       you submit a report.  See "Reporting Bugs" below.

   <b>Bounds</b> <b>Checking</b> <b>Constructs</b>
       Several bugs, including a segmentation fault, have been fixed with the bounds checking constructs
       (introduced in Perl 5.22) "\b{gcb}", "\b{sb}", "\b{wb}", "\B{gcb}", "\B{sb}", and "\B{wb}".  All the
       "\B{}" ones now match an empty string; none of the "\b{}" ones do.  [GH #14976]
       &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14976&gt;

</pre><h4><b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Updated</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b>
       •   Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 5.20150520 to 5.20151213.

       •   PerlIO::scalar has been upgraded from version 0.22 to 0.23.

       •   POSIX has been upgraded from version 1.53 to 1.53_01.

           If  "POSIX::strerror"  was  passed $! as its argument then it accidentally cleared $!.  This has been
           fixed.  [GH #14951] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14951&gt;

       •   Storable has been upgraded from version 2.53 to 2.53_01.

       •   warnings has been upgraded from version 1.32 to 1.34.

           The   "warnings::enabled"   example   now   actually   uses   "warnings::enabled".     [GH    #14905]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14905&gt;

       •   Win32 has been upgraded from version 0.51 to 0.52.

           This has been updated for Windows 8.1, 10 and 2012 R2 Server.

</pre><h4><b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Existing</b> <b>Documentation</b>
       <u>perltie</u>

       •   The usage of "FIRSTKEY" and "NEXTKEY" has been clarified.

       <u>perlvar</u>

       •   The  specific  true  value of $!{E...} is now documented, noting that it is subject to change and not
           guaranteed.

</pre><h4><b>Diagnostics</b></h4><pre>
       The following additions or changes have been made to diagnostic  output,  including  warnings  and  fatal
       error messages.  For the complete list of diagnostic messages, see perldiag.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Existing</b> <b>Diagnostics</b>
       •   The  "printf"  and  "sprintf"  builtins  are  now more careful about the warnings they emit: argument
           reordering  now  disables  the  "redundant   argument"   warning   in   all   cases.    [GH   #14772]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14772&gt;

</pre><h4><b>Configuration</b> <b>and</b> <b>Compilation</b></h4><pre>
       •   Using    the    "NO_HASH_SEED"    define   in   combination   with   the   default   hash   algorithm
           "PERL_HASH_FUNC_ONE_AT_A_TIME_HARD" resulted in a fatal error while compiling the interpreter,  since
           Perl 5.17.10.  This has been fixed.

       •   Configuring  with  ccflags containing quotes (e.g.  "-Accflags='-DAPPLLIB_EXP=\"/usr/libperl\"'") was
           broken    in    Perl    5.22.0    but    has    now    been     fixed     again.      [GH     #14732]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14732&gt;

</pre><h4><b>Platform</b> <b>Support</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Platform-Specific</b> <b>Notes</b>
       IRIX
           •   Under  some circumstances IRIX stdio <b>fgetc()</b> and <b>fread()</b> set the errno to "ENOENT", which made no
               sense according to either IRIX or POSIX docs.  Errno is now cleared in such cases.   [GH  #14557]
               &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14557&gt;

           •   Problems   when   multiplying   long   doubles   by   infinity  have  been  fixed.   [GH  #14993]
               &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14993&gt;

           •   All tests pass now on IRIX with the default build configuration.

</pre><h4><b>Selected</b> <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b></h4><pre>
       •   "qr/(?[  ()  ])/"  no  longer  segfaults,  giving  a  syntax  error  message  instead.   [GH  #14851]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14851&gt;

       •   Regular  expression  possessive quantifier Perl 5.20 regression now fixed.  "qr/"<u>PAT</u>"{"<u>min</u>,<u>max</u>"}+""/"
           is supposed to behave identically to "qr/(?&gt;"<u>PAT</u>"{"<u>min</u>,<u>max</u>"})/".  Since Perl 5.20, this  didn't  work
           if <u>min</u> and <u>max</u> were equal.  [GH #14857] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14857&gt;

       •   Certain  syntax  errors  in  "Extended  Bracketed Character Classes" in perlrecharclass caused panics
           instead   of   the   proper   error   message.    This   has   now   been   fixed.     [GH    #15016]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15016&gt;

       •   "BEGIN   &lt;&gt;"   no   longer   segfaults   and   properly  produces  an  error  message.   [GH  #13546]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/13546&gt;

       •   A regression from Perl 5.20 has been fixed, in which some  syntax  errors  in  "(?[...])"  constructs
           within  regular  expression  patterns  could cause a segfault instead of a proper error message.  [GH
           #14933] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14933&gt;

       •   Another problem with "(?[...])"  constructs has been fixed wherein  things  like  "\c]"  could  cause
           panics.  [GH #14934] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14934&gt;

       •   In  Perl  5.22.0,  the logic changed when parsing a numeric parameter to the -C option, such that the
           successfully parsed number was not saved as the option value if it parsed to the end of the argument.
           [GH #14748] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14748&gt;

       •   Warning fatality is now ignored when rewinding the stack.  This prevents infinite recursion when  the
           now     fatal     error     also     causes     rewinding     of     the    stack.     [GH    #14319]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14319&gt;

       •   A     crash     with     "%::=();     J-&gt;${\"::"}"     has     been     fixed.       [GH      #14790]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14790&gt;

       •   Nested  quantifiers  such  as  "<a href="file:/.">/.</a>{1}??/"  should  cause  perl to throw a fatal error, but were being
           silently    accepted    since    Perl    5.20.0.     This    has    been    fixed.     [GH    #14960]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14960&gt;

       •   Regular  expression  sequences  such  as  "/(?i/"  (and  similarly  with  other  recognized  flags or
           combination of flags) should cause perl to throw a fatal error,  but  were  being  silently  accepted
           since Perl 5.18.0.  This has been fixed.  [GH #14931] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14931&gt;

       •   A bug in hexadecimal floating point literal support meant that high-order bits could be lost in cases
           where  mantissa overflow was caused by too many trailing zeros in the fractional part.  This has been
           fixed.  [GH #15032] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15032&gt;

       •   Another hexadecimal floating point bug, causing low-order bits to be lost in  cases  where  the  last
           hexadecimal digit of the mantissa has bits straddling the limit of the number of bits allowed for the
           mantissa, has also been fixed.  [GH #15033] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15033&gt;

       •   Further  hexadecimal  floating  point  bugs  have  been  fixed:  In some circumstances, the %a format
           specifier could variously lose the sign of the negative zero, fail to display zeros after  the  radix
           point with the requested precision, or even lose the radix point after the leftmost hexadecimal digit
           completely.

       •   A  crash  caused by incomplete expressions within "/(?[ ])/" (e.g.  "/(?[[0]+()+])/") has been fixed.
           [GH #15045] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15045&gt;

       Perl 5.22.1 represents approximately 6 months of development since Perl 5.22.0 and contains approximately
       19,000 lines of changes across 130 files from 27 authors.

       Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were approximately 1,700 lines  of
       changes to 44 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

       Perl  continues  to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and developers.
       The following people are known to have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.22.1:

       Aaron Crane, Abigail, Andy Broad, Aristotle Pagaltzis, Chase Whitener, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Craig  A.

       The  list  above  is  almost  certainly  incomplete as it is automatically generated from version control
       history.  In particular, it does not include the names of the (very much  appreciated)  contributors  who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many  of  the  changes  included  in this version originated in the CPAN modules included in Perl's core.
       We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for helping Perl to flourish.

</pre><h4><b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  find  what  you  think  is  a  bug,  you  might  check  the  articles  recently  posted  to  the
       comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at https://rt.perl.org/  .   There  may  also  be
       information at <a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a> , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with your release.  Be
       sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of
       "perl -V", will be sent off to <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a> to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly
       archived  mailing  list,  then please send it to <a href="mailto:perl5-security-report@perl.org">perl5-security-report@perl.org</a>.  This points to a closed
       subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be  able  to  help
       assess  the  impact  of  issues,  figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to
       mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which  Perl  is  supported.   Please  only  use  this
       address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
