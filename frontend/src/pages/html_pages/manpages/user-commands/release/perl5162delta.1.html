</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl5162delta - what is new for perl v5.16.2

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.16.1 release and the 5.16.2 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.16.0, first read perl5161delta, which describes
       differences between 5.16.0 and 5.16.1.

</pre><h4><b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.16.0 If any exist, they are bugs, and we request
       that you submit a report.  See "Reporting Bugs" below.

</pre><h4><b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Updated</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b>
       •   Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 2.70 to version 2.76.

</pre><h4><b>Configuration</b> <b>and</b> <b>Compilation</b></h4><pre>
       •   configuration should no longer be confused by ls colorization

</pre><h4><b>Platform</b> <b>Support</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Platform-Specific</b> <b>Notes</b>
       AIX Configure  now always adds -qlanglvl=extc99 to the CC flags on AIX when using xlC.  This will make it
           easier to compile a number of XS-based modules that assume C99 [perl #113778].

</pre><h4><b>Selected</b> <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b></h4><pre>
       •   fix /\h/ equivalence with /[\h]/

           see [perl #114220]

</pre><h4><b>Known</b> <b>Problems</b></h4><pre>
       There are no new known problems.

</pre><h4><b>Acknowledgements</b></h4><pre>
       Perl 5.16.2 represents approximately 2 months of development since Perl 5.16.1 and contains approximately
       740 lines of changes across 20 files from 9 authors.

       Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users  and  developers.
       The following people are known to have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.16.2:

       Andy  Dougherty,  Craig  A.  Berry,  Darin McBride, Dominic Hargreaves, Karen Etheridge, Karl Williamson,
       Peter Martini, Ricardo Signes, Tony Cook.

       The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it  is  automatically  generated  from  version  control
       history.  In  particular,  it  does not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see the  <u>AUTHORS</u>  file  in  the
       Perl source distribution.

</pre><h4><b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  find  what  you  think  is  a  bug,  you  might  check  the  articles  recently  posted  to  the
       comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at <a href="http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/">http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/</a> .  There may  also
       be information at <a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a> , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with your release.  Be
       sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of
       "perl -V", will be sent off to <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a> to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly
       archived  mailing  list,  then  please send it to <a href="mailto:perl5-security-report@perl.org">perl5-security-report@perl.org</a>. This points to a closed
       subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be  able  to  help
       assess  the  impact  of  issues,  figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to
       mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address
       for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
