</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl5184delta - what is new for perl v5.18.4

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.18.4 release and the 5.18.2 release.  <b>Please</b> <b>note:</b>
       This document ignores perl 5.18.3, a broken release which existed for a few hours only.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.18.1, first read perl5182delta, which describes
       differences between 5.18.1 and 5.18.2.

</pre><h4><b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Updated</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b>
       •   Digest::SHA has been upgraded from 5.84_01 to 5.84_02.

       •   perl5db.pl has been upgraded from version 1.39_10 to 1.39_11.

           This  fixes  a crash in tab completion, where available. [perl #120827]  Also, filehandle information
           is properly reset after a pager is run. [perl #121456]

</pre><h4><b>Platform</b> <b>Support</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Platform-Specific</b> <b>Notes</b>
       Win32
           •   Introduced by [GH #12161] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/12161&gt;, a memory  leak  on  every
               call  to  "system" and backticks ( `` ), on most Win32 Perls starting from 5.18.0 has been fixed.
               The memory leak only occurred if you enabled pseudo-fork in your build of Win32  Perl,  and  were
               running  that  build  on Server 2003 R2 or newer OS.  The leak does not appear on WinXP SP3.  [GH
               #13741] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/13741&gt;

</pre><h4><b>Selected</b> <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b></h4><pre>
       •   The debugger now properly resets filehandles as needed. [perl #121456]

       •   A segfault in Digest::SHA has been addressed.  [perl #121421]

       •   perl can again be built with USE_64_BIT_INT, with Visual C 2003, 32 bit.  [perl #120925]

       •   A leading { (brace) in formats is properly parsed again. [perl #119973]

       •   Copy the values used to perturb hash iteration when cloning an interpreter.  This was fairly harmless
           but caused "valgrind" to complain. [perl #121336]

       •   In Perl v5.18 "undef *_; goto &amp;sub" and "local *_; goto &amp;sub" started crashing.  This has been fixed.
           [perl #119949]

</pre><h4><b>Acknowledgements</b></h4><pre>
       Perl 5.18.4 represents approximately 9 months of development since Perl 5.18.2 and contains approximately
       2,000 lines of changes across 53 files from 13 authors.

       Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users  and  developers.
       The following people are known to have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.18.4:

       Daniel  Dragan,  David  Mitchell,  Doug  Bell,  Father  Chrysostomos, Hiroo Hayashi, James E Keenan, Karl
       Williamson, Mark Shelor, Ricardo Signes, Shlomi Fish, Smylers, Steve Hay, Tony Cook.

       The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it  is  automatically  generated  from  version  control
       history.  In  particular,  it  does not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN  modules  included  in  Perl's  core.
       We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for helping Perl to flourish.

       For  a  more  complete  list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see the <u>AUTHORS</u> file in the
       Perl source distribution.

</pre><h4><b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  find  what  you  think  is  a  bug,  you  might  check  the  articles  recently  posted  to  the
       comp.lang.perl.misc  newsgroup and the perl bug database at <a href="http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/">http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/</a> .  There may also
       be information at <a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a> , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with your release.  Be
       sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of
       "perl -V", will be sent off to <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a> to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly
       archived mailing list, then please send it to <a href="mailto:perl5-security-report@perl.org">perl5-security-report@perl.org</a>.  This points  to  a  closed
       subscription  unarchived  mailing  list, which includes all the core committers, who will be able to help
       assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate  the  release  of  patches  to
       mitigate  or  fix  the  problem  across  all  platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this
       address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
