       guestfs-release-notes - libguestfs Release Notes

</pre><h4><b>RELEASE</b> <b>NOTES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>LIBGUESTFS</b> <b>1.34</b></h4><pre>
       These release notes only cover the differences from the previous stable/dev branch split (1.32.0).  For
       detailed changelogs, please see the git repository, or the ChangeLog file distributed in the tarball.

   <b>New</b> <b>features</b>
       Multiple performance enhancements were made in libguestfs.  The "hot cache" time to launch to appliance
       should be under 1 second assuming recent qemu and kernel are installed.  There are also new utilities for
       precisely benchmarking libguestfs (<u>utils/boot-benchmark</u> and <u>utils/boot-analysis</u> in the source tree).

       The virt-p2v tool for converting physical machines to virtual machines was substantially improved.  This
       includes: clearer, coloured output during conversions, support for Gtk 3, more detailed information about
       hardware, click to identify network interfaces, more debugging tools included with the ISO, and many bug
       fixes.

       f2fs (Flash Friendly File System) is now supported (Pino Toscano).

       <u>New</u> <u>tools</u>

       <b><a href="../man1/virt-p2v-make-kiwi.1.html">virt-p2v-make-kiwi</a></b>(1) can be used to build the virt-p2v ISO based on SLES and openSUSE, using the kiwi
       utility (Cédric Bosdonnat).

       <u>New</u> <u>features</u> <u>in</u> <u>existing</u> <u>tools</u>

       virt-resize will now preserve the GPT GUID.  This was required for Windows Server 2012 R2, where the
       bootloader would become confused if the GUID changed (Maxim Perevedentsev).

       virt-resize will use sparse copying for (old MBR-style) extended partitions.  This makes resizing of
       guests that use extended partitions much faster (Maxim Perevedentsev).

       virt-p2v kernel command line options can now be used to set defaults for GUI configuration.

       The virt-p2v debugging options have been completely removed, simplifying the interface and documentation.
       Debugging information is now captured fully automatically.

       virt-p2v-make-disk lets you specify an <u>--arch</u> option, allowing you to build a 32 bit virt-p2v, for
       compatibility with older systems.

       virt-p2v-make-disk no longer requires that you specify an "os-version" for the virt-p2v disk.  If omitted
       it will try to choose a suitable "os-version" depending on your host system.

       virt-p2v-make-disk and virt-p2v-make-kickstart both gain a new <u>--install</u> option that allows you to add
       arbitrary extra packages to the virt-p2v ISO, for customization, additional debugging tools and so on.

       virt-v2v will now uninstall Parallels Tools (or the equivalent Virtuozzo Tools) from Linux guests.  Also
       stop the Windows drivers from loading at boot.  (Roman Kagan and Pavel Butsykin)

       virt-v2v <u>--in-place</u> mode has been enhanced to allow the caller to choose whether or not to install
       certain virtio drivers in the guest (Roman Kagan).

       virt-v2v conversion of Windows guests was substantially rewritten and simplified (Roman Kagan).

       virt-v2v <u>--in-place</u> mode now supports installing virtio-scsi drivers in guests (Roman Kagan).

       virt-v2v can now convert SUSE guests with and without UEFI (Cédric Bosdonnat and Jim Fehlig).

       virt-v2v can now convert guests to Glance that have multiple disks.  Previously it would fail on such
       guests.

       The virt-v2v <u>--no-trim</u> and <u>--vmtype</u> options are now no-ops.  They will print a warning but are otherwise
       ignored.  virt-v2v can now generate the OVF vmtype correctly without user intervention.

       virt-v2v has now been tested against SUSE Xen as a source hypervisor (Cédric Bosdonnat).

       virt-v2v adds support for SUSE VMDP drivers (Cédric Bosdonnat).

       virt-v2v can convert OVA files containing subfolders, as produced by SUSE Studio (Cédric Bosdonnat).

       virt-v2v sets the OVF "&lt;Origin&gt;" element correctly.  oVirt has been extended to support more source
       hypervisors (Shahar Havivi).

       virt-v2v now supports Windows Server 2016 (Tomáš Golembiovský).

       The virt-builder <u>--list</u> option can now be used to show all templates or a single template (Pino Toscano).

       All OCaml-based tools now use <b><a href="../man3/getopt_long.3.html">getopt_long</a></b>(3) for option parsing, and <u>--help</u> output has been improved
       (Pino Toscano).

       virt-builder and virt-customize <u>--selinux-relabel</u> option can now fully relabel the guest filesystem at
       build time, without requiring a lengthy autorelabel at first boot.

       virt-customize <u>--delete</u> now accepts globs.

       New virt-customize <u>--uninstall</u> option lets you uninstall packages.

       virt-customize can now use "pvvxsvc" as an alternative to "rhsrvany" for running firstboot scripts in
       Windows guests (Cédric Bosdonnat).

       virt-customize now uses the strongest hashing scheme for passwords on Arch and Void Linux (Pino Toscano).

       virt-customize <u>--install</u> now works correctly on Arch (Pino Toscano).

       virt-inspector has new options <u>--no-applications</u> and <u>--no-icon</u> to prevent the list of applications and
       icon from being included in the XML output (Pino Toscano).

       New virt-sysprep <u>--network</u> option has been added, allowing you to actually use the <u>--install</u> etc options
       which were present in virt-sysprep before but did not usually work.  Note that the network is still
       disabled by default.

       virt-sysprep "fs-uuids" operation no longer fails on btrfs guests (Maxim Perevedentsev).

       virt-dib can output Docker images (Pino Toscano).

       virt-dib has a new <u>--drive-format</u> option to allow the user to specify the format of the helper drive
       (Pino Toscano).

       All OCaml virt tools now have a <u>--colors</u>/<u>--colours</u> option which enables coloured output (using ANSI
       escape sequences) even if the output is not a tty.  The default is to check if the output is a tty and
       disable coloured output if not.  This allows coloured output to be consumed by other tools.

       <u>Language</u> <u>bindings</u>

       PHP test coverage has been enhanced (Pino Toscano).

       PHP 7 is now supported (Pino Toscano).

       Python bindings are now compliant with PEP 8 (Pino Toscano).

       A Python pip package is available in <a href="http://libguestfs.org/download/python/">http://libguestfs.org/download/python/</a>

       The Ruby bindings now print the full exception if one is thrown by the event callback.  Note this is
       still incorrect behaviour as event callbacks should not throw exceptions, but it aids debugging.

       All OCaml libraries and programs are now compiled with <u>-safe-string</u>, if supported by the OCaml compiler.

       <u>Inspection</u>

       Alpine Linux using busybox can now be inspected.  Also the APK package manager is supported in virt-
       customize (Pino Toscano).

       We now handle inspection of Mageia 4 (Pino Toscano).

       Void Linux and the Void Linux xbps package manager are fully supported (Pino Toscano).

       Parsing of CoreOS version information has been enhanced (Pino Toscano).

       It is now possible to get an icon from ALT Linux (Pino Toscano).

       PLD Linux versions &lt; 3 are now recognized (Pino Toscano).

       Windows drive letters are now returned for guests using GPT partitions (Dawid Zamirski).

       We can now correctly inspect Unix guests that do not have an <u><a href="file:/etc/fstab">/etc/fstab</a></u> file (Pino Toscano).

       Added another source for the Ubuntu icon which doesn't rely on GNOME having been installed in the guest.

       We can now get an icon for Windows 7 64 bit guests.

       Libosinfo integration was rewritten to deal with the new database format used by osinfo (Pino Toscano).

       <u>Documentation</u>

       New manual page <b><a href="../man1/guestfs-building.1.html">guestfs-building</a></b>(1) describes how to build libguestfs from source.

       The man pages, tools and tool <u>--help</u> output is now automatically checked to ensure that all tool options
       are properly documented, that warning sections are included where necessary, and that every page has a
       description section.

       The <b><a href="../man1/guestfs-testing.1.html">guestfs-testing</a></b>(1) man page has been refreshed and based on a newer libguestfs.

       <u>Architectures</u> <u>and</u> <u>platforms</u>

       virt-customize now works on POWER7 and POWER8 platforms, both big endian and little endian (Xianghua Chen
       and Hu Zhang).

   <b>Security</b>
       See also <b><a href="../man1/guestfs-security.1.html">guestfs-security</a></b>(1).

       <u>CVE-2015-8869</u>

       https://bugzilla.redhat.com/CVE-2015-8869

       This vulnerability in OCaml might affect virt tools written in the OCaml programming language.  It
       affects only 64 bit platforms.  Because this bug affects code generation it is difficult to predict which
       precise software could be affected, and therefore our recommendation is that you recompile libguestfs
       using a version of the OCaml compiler where this bug has been fixed (or ask your Linux distro to do the
       same).

       <u>virt-customize</u> <u>ownership</u> <u>of</u> <u>.ssh,</u> <u>.ssh/authorized_keys</u>

       https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1337561

       Previously when virt-customize injected an SSH key into a guest, when it created the <u><a href="file:~/.ssh">~/.ssh</a></u> and
       <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/authorized_keys">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</a></u> directory and file (in case they were missing) it created them with owner and
       group "root.root".  This has been fixed so the correct user is used.  This is not thought to have been
       exploitable.

       <u>Windows</u> <u>"%systemroot%"</u>

       The inspection code has been made more robust against guests which might use very long "%systemroot%"
       (derived from the guest-controlled Windows Registry).  This is not thought to have been exploitable.

       <u>Virtio-rng</u> <u>is</u> <u>now</u> <u>available</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>appliance</u>

       virtio-rng (the virtual Random Number Generator device) is now passed to the appliance, which should
       improve the quality random numbers generated for GUIDs and cryptographic key generation.

   <b>API</b>
       <u>New</u> <u>APIs</u>

       "btrfs_filesystem_show"
           List all devices where a btrfs filesystem is spanned (Pino Toscano).

       "download_blocks"
       "download_inode"
       "filesystem_walk"
           Download  filesystem  data  blocks from a given partition.  Download arbitrary files by inode number.
           Retrieve all files from a filesystem including deleted files.

           Note these require optional dependency The Sleuth Kit.  (Matteo Cafasso)

       "get_sockdir"
           Read the path where temporary sockets are stored (Pino Toscano).

       "mountable_device"
       "mountable_subvolume"
           Split a Mountable into device name and subvolume (Cédric Bosdonnat).

       "ntfscat_i"
           Download NTFS file by inode number (Matteo Cafasso).

       "part_expand_gpt"
           Allow in-place expanding of GPT partitions by moving the second (backup) partition table to  the  end
           of the disk (Maxim Perevedentsev).

       "part_get_disk_guid"
       "part_set_disk_guid"
       "part_set_disk_guid_random"
           Get and set the GPT disk GUID, or set it to a fresh random value (Maxim Perevedentsev).

       "selinux_relabel"
           SELinux-relabel part or all of the guest filesystem.

       <u>Other</u> <u>API</u> <u>changes</u>

       "guestfs_set_selinux",  "guestfs_get_selinux",  "guestfs_setcon", "guestfs_getcon" and "guestfs_llz" have
       been  deprecated.   Use  the   new   API   "guestfs_selinux_relabel"   to   relabel   filesystems.    Use
       "guestfs_lgetxattrs" to list the "security.selinux" extended attributes of existing files.

       "guestfs_vfs_minimum_size" can now be used on dirty filesystems (Maxim Perevedentsev).

       "guestfs_ll" now works on paths which contain absolute symlinks (Pino Toscano).

       "guestfs_glob_expand"  now  has  an  optional  "directoryslash"  boolean parameter which controls whether
       trailing slashes are returned for directory names (Pino Toscano).

       "guestfs_lvs" will no longer return LVs which have the "activationskip" flag set.   The  reason  is  that
       such  LVs  have  no  "/dev/VG/LV"  device node and so code which read the list of LVs and then probed the
       devices themselves would immediately fail.  You can use "guestfs_lvs_full" if you want to read  all  LVs.
       (Pino Toscano).

       "guestfs_list_disk_labels"  now  no  longer  fails  if  no  disks with labels were added.  Instead it now
       returns an empty list (Pino Toscano).

       "guestfs_is_lv"  no  longer  fails  if  passed  a  btrfs  subvolume,  it  returns  false  instead  (Maxim
       Perevedentsev).

   <b>Build</b> <b>changes</b>
       qemu ≥ 1.3.0 is required.

       yajl (a JSON parsing library) is required to build libguestfs.

       You can now build with GCC 6.

       "make check-valgrind" now has substantially better coverage.

       "make check-slow" now works again.

       Use  "make  -C appliance clean-supermin-appliance" to clean the supermin appliance (it will be rebuilt on
       next "make").

       There are a variety of  new  rules  for  running  virt-p2v  from  the  source  directory:  "make  -C  p2v
       run-virt-p2v-directly"   |   "run-virt-p2v-in-a-vm"   |   "run-virt-p2v-non-gui-conversion".   These  are
       documented further in <b><a href="../man1/guestfs-hacking.1.html">guestfs-hacking</a></b>(1).

       virt-p2v may be built using either Gtk 2 or Gtk 3.  To force a particular version  of  Gtk  to  be  used,
       "./configure --with-gtk=2|3"

       The "./configure" options are now mostly documented in <b><a href="../man1/guestfs-building.1.html">guestfs-building</a></b>(1).

   <b>Internals</b>
       In  git, versions are now tagged with "v1.XX.YY" (previously they were tagged with "1.XX.YY").  Using the
       "v-" prefix is more common in git repositories.

       When using the libvirt backend, we now wait for qemu to exit gracefully instead of killing  it  after  15
       seconds.  This helps when writing to slow devices (especially cheap USB keys).

       Error messages from libvirt now include the "err-&gt;int1" field which usually contains the "errno".

       On  ARM,  all DTB (device tree) code has been removed.  qemu creates the right device tree on the fly, we
       do not need to specify one.

       The C API tests now use larger test disks, allowing BTRFS to be tested properly (Pino Toscano).

       The tests should now work on a pure Python 3 host (Pino Toscano).

       In C bindings, internal functions are now (mostly) consistently named "guestfs_int_*" whereas  previously
       there was no consistent scheme.

       The  old  "safe_malloc"  etc  functions  are  now no longer exported by the library, nor used in language
       bindings.

       Setting TMPDIR to a path longer than ~ 100 characters will no longer cause libguestfs  to  fail  silently
       and randomly when creating Unix domain sockets (Pino Toscano).

       The "COMPILE_REGEXP" macro can now be used in the daemon.

       When tracing, results containing structs are now printed in full (Pino Toscano).

       The Perl "Sys::Guestfs" module now no longer embeds an incrementing API "version number".  This module is
       now  always  at  phony  version  "1.0".   To  find the real version of libguestfs from Perl you must call
       "$g-&gt;version".

       All code is compiled with "-Wstack-usage=10000" and multiple changes  have  been  made  to  remove  stack
       allocation of large strings and buffers.

       The  <b><a href="../man3/error.3.html">error</a></b>(3)  function  is now used everywhere, replacing most previous uses of <b><a href="../man3/perror.3.html">perror</a></b>(3) + <b><a href="../man3/exit.3.html">exit</a></b>(3), and
       <b><a href="../man3/fprintf.3.html">fprintf</a></b>(3) + exit.

       In  C  code,  "/**"  comments  are  turned  into  documentation  which  is  automatically  added  to  the
       <b><a href="../man1/guestfs-hacking.1.html">guestfs-hacking</a></b>(1) manual page.

       A  safe  "getumask"  function has been added.  For recent Linux kernels this uses the newly added "Umask"
       field in <u><a href="file:/proc/self/status">/proc/self/status</a></u>.  For older Linux and other Unix, this uses a thread-safe technique  involving
       <b><a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</a></b>(2) (thanks: Josh Stone, Jiri Jaburek, Eric Blake).

       Safe <b><a href="../man2/posix_fadvise.2.html">posix_fadvise</a></b>(2) wrappers have been added, and more hints have been added to the code which may make
       a minor difference to performance.

       A safe wrapper around <b><a href="../man2/waitpid.2.html">waitpid</a></b>(2) has been added which handles "INTR" properly.

       "podwrapper.pl"  (used  to  generate the manual pages) now stops if any POD error is found.  A new script
       called "podcheck.pl" does cross-checking of <u>--help</u> output, tool options and manual pages.

       All version numbers in the library (eg.  versions  of  qemu,  versions  of  libvirt,  versions  of  guest
       operating systems) are unified in a single file <u>src/version.c</u> (Pino Toscano).

       On  Windows  guests, virt-customize will use the vendor-neutral path "C:\Program Files\Guestfs\Firstboot"
       to store firstboot scripts.  Previously it used "C:\Program Files\Red Hat\Firstboot".  This change should
       be invisible to the scripts themselves.  (Cédric Bosdonnat)

       On Linux guests, the firstboot services generated by virt-builder <u>--firstboot</u> etc have  been  renamed  to
       "guestfs-firstboot" (Pino Toscano).

       There  is  now  a  common  "debug"  function  used  by all OCaml tools, replacing previous code which did
       "if verbose () then printf ...".

       virt-p2v copies files it needs over to the virt-v2v conversion server using <b><a href="../man1/scp.1.html">scp</a></b>(1), instead of trying  to
       send  them via the shell session.  This should improve reliability and should be a completely transparent
       to end users.

       All code in <u>mllib</u> is now built into a single "mllib.cma" or "mllib.cmxa" library.  All code in  <u>customize</u>
       is now built into a single "customize.cma" or "customize.cmxa" library.  This simplifies the build of the
       OCaml tools.

       <b><a href="../man8/lvmetad.8.html">lvmetad</a></b>(8) is now used in the appliance when available (Pino Toscano).

       "Silent  rules"  are  used for OCaml, Java, Erlang and POD.  Use "make V=1" to see the full command lines
       again (Pino Toscano).
