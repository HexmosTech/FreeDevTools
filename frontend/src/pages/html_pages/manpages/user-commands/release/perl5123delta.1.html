</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl5123delta - what is new for perl v5.12.3

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.12.2 release and the 5.12.3 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.12.1, first read perl5122delta, which describes
       differences between 5.12.1 and 5.12.2.  The major changes made in 5.12.0 are described in perl5120delta.

</pre><h4><b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
           There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.12.2. If any
           exist, they are bugs and reports are welcome.

</pre><h4><b>Core</b> <b>Enhancements</b></h4><pre>
   <b>"keys",</b> <b>"values"</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>arrays</b>
       You can now use the "keys", "values", "each" builtin functions on arrays (previously you could only use
       them on hashes).  See perlfunc for details.  This is actually a change introduced in perl 5.12.0, but it
       was missed from that release's perldelta.

</pre><h4><b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b></h4><pre>
       "no VERSION" will now correctly deparse with B::Deparse, as will certain constant expressions.

       Module::Build should be more reliably pass its tests under cygwin.

       Lvalue subroutines are again able to return copy-on-write scalars.  This had been broken since version
       5.10.0.

</pre><h4><b>Platform</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Notes</b></h4><pre>
       Solaris
           A  separate  DTrace is now build for miniperl, which means that perl can be compiled with -Dusedtrace
           on Solaris again.

       VMS A number of regressions on VMS have been  fixed.   In  addition  to  minor  cleanup  of  questionable
           expressions  in <u>vms.c</u>, file permissions should no longer be garbled by the PerlIO layer, and spurious
           record boundaries should no longer be introduced by the PerlIO layer during output.

           For more details and discussion on the latter, see:

               <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.vmsperl/2010/11/msg15419.html">http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.vmsperl/2010/11/msg15419.html</a>

       VOS A few very small changes were made to the build process  on  VOS  to  better  support  the  platform.
           Longer-than-32-character  filenames  are  now  supported  on OpenVOS, and build properly without IPv6
           support.

</pre><h4><b>Acknowledgements</b></h4><pre>
       Perl 5.12.3  represents  approximately  four  months  of  development  since  Perl  5.12.2  and  contains
       approximately 2500 lines of changes across 54 files from 16 authors.

       Perl  continues  to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and developers.
       The following people are known to have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.12.3:

       Craig A. Berry, David Golden, David Leadbeater, Father Chrysostomos, Florian Ragwitz, Jesse Vincent, Karl
       Williamson, Nick Johnston, Nicolas Kaiser, Paul  Green,  Rafael  Garcia-Suarez,  Rainer  Tammer,  Ricardo
       Signes, Steffen Mueller, Zsbán Ambrus, Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason

</pre><h4><b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  find  what  you  think  is  a  bug,  you  might  check  the  articles  recently  posted  to  the
       comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at <a href="http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/">http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/</a> .  There may  also
       be information at <a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a> , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the <b>perlbug</b> program included with your release.  Be
       sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of
       "perl -V", will be sent off to <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a> to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly
       archived  mailing  list,  then  please send it to <a href="mailto:perl5-security-report@perl.org">perl5-security-report@perl.org</a>. This points to a closed
       subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be  able  to  help
       assess  the  impact  of  issues,  figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to
       mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address
       for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
