</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl5301delta - what is new for perl v5.30.1

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.30.0 release and the 5.30.1 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.28.0, first read perl5300delta, which describes
       differences between 5.28.0 and 5.30.0.

</pre><h4><b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.30.1.  If any exist, they are bugs, and we request
       that you submit a report.  See "Reporting Bugs" below.

</pre><h4><b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Updated</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b>
       •   Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 5.20190522 to 5.20191110.

</pre><h4><b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Existing</b> <b>Documentation</b>
       We  have  attempted  to  update the documentation to reflect the changes listed in this document.  If you
       find any we have missed, send email to <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a> &lt;<a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">mailto:perlbug@perl.org</a>&gt;.

       Additionally, documentation has been updated to reference GitHub as the new canonical repository  and  to
       describe the new GitHub pull request workflow.

</pre><h4><b>Configuration</b> <b>and</b> <b>Compilation</b></h4><pre>
       •   The  "ECHO"  macro  is  now defined.  This is used in a "dtrace" rule that was originally changed for
           FreeBSD, and the FreeBSD make apparently predefines it.  The Solaris make does not  predefine  "ECHO"
           which broke this rule on Solaris.  [perl #17057] &lt;https://github.com/perl/perl5/issues/17057&gt;

</pre><h4><b>Testing</b></h4><pre>
       Tests were added and changed to reflect the other additions and changes in this release.

</pre><h4><b>Platform</b> <b>Support</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Platform-Specific</b> <b>Notes</b>
       Win32
           The locale tests could crash on Win32 due to a Windows bug, and separately due to the CRT throwing an
           exception if the locale name wasn't validly encoded in the current code page.

           For the second we now decode the locale name ourselves, and always decode it as UTF-8.

           [perl #16922] &lt;https://github.com/perl/perl5/issues/16922&gt;

</pre><h4><b>Selected</b> <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b></h4><pre>
       •   Setting  $)  now  properly sets supplementary group ids, if you have the necessary privileges.  [perl
           #17031] &lt;https://github.com/perl/perl5/issues/17031&gt;

       •   "readline @foo" now evaluates @foo in scalar context.  Previously, it  would  be  evaluated  in  list
           context, and since <b>readline()</b> pops only one argument from the stack, the stack could underflow, or be
           left with unexpected values on it.  [perl #16929] &lt;https://github.com/perl/perl5/issues/16929&gt;

       •   <b>sv_gets()</b>  now  recovers  better  if  the  target  SV is modified by a signal handler.  [perl #16960]
           &lt;https://github.com/perl/perl5/issues/16960&gt;

       •   Matching a non-"SVf_UTF8" string against a regular expression containing Unicode literals could  leak
           an SV on each match attempt.  [perl #17140] &lt;https://github.com/perl/perl5/issues/17140&gt;

       •   "sprintf("%.*a",  -10000,  $x)"  would  cause  a  buffer  overflow due to mishandling of the negative
           precision value.  [perl #16942] &lt;https://github.com/perl/perl5/issues/16942&gt;

       •   scalar() on a reference could cause an erroneous assertion failure during compilation.  [perl #16969]
           &lt;https://github.com/perl/perl5/issues/16969&gt;

</pre><h4><b>Acknowledgements</b></h4><pre>
       Perl 5.30.1 represents approximately 6 months of development since Perl 5.30.0 and contains approximately
       4,700 lines of changes across 67 files from 14 authors.

       Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were approximately  910  lines  of
       changes to 20 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

       Perl  continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and developers.
       The following people are known to have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.30.1:

       Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Dan Book, David Mitchell, Hugo van der Sanden, James E Keenan, Karen  Etheridge,
       Karl Williamson, Manuel Mausz, Max Maischein, Nicolas R., Sawyer X, Steve Hay, Tom Hukins, Tony Cook.

       The  list  above  is  almost  certainly  incomplete as it is automatically generated from version control
       history.  In particular, it does not include the names of the (very much  appreciated)  contributors  who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many  of  the  changes  included  in this version originated in the CPAN modules included in Perl's core.
       We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for helping Perl to flourish.

       For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see the  <u>AUTHORS</u>  file  in  the
       Perl source distribution.

</pre><h4><b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  find  what  you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database at &lt;https://rt.perl.org/&gt;.
       There may also be information at &lt;<a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a>&gt;, the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with your release.  Be
       sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of
       "perl -V", will be sent off to <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a> to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it inappropriate to send to a  publicly
       archived  mailing  list,  then see "SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION" in perlsec for details of
       how to report the issue.

</pre><h4><b>Give</b> <b>Thanks</b></h4><pre>
       If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5, you can do so by running  the
       "perlthanks" program:

           perlthanks

       This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of thanks.
