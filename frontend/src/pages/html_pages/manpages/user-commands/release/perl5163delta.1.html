</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl5163delta - what is new for perl v5.16.3

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.16.2 release and the 5.16.3 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.16.1, first read perl5162delta, which describes
       differences between 5.16.1 and 5.16.2.

</pre><h4><b>Core</b> <b>Enhancements</b></h4><pre>
       No changes since 5.16.0.

</pre><h4><b>Security</b></h4><pre>
       This release contains one major and a number of minor security fixes.  These latter are included mainly
       to allow the test suite to pass cleanly with the clang compiler's address sanitizer facility.

   <b>CVE-2013-1667:</b> <b>memory</b> <b>exhaustion</b> <b>with</b> <b>arbitrary</b> <b>hash</b> <b>keys</b>
       With a carefully crafted set of hash keys (for example arguments on a URL), it is possible to cause a
       hash to consume a large amount of memory and CPU, and thus possibly to achieve a Denial-of-Service.

       This problem has been fixed.

   <b>wrap-around</b> <b>with</b> <b>IO</b> <b>on</b> <b>long</b> <b>strings</b>
       Reading or writing strings greater than 2**31 bytes in size could segfault due to integer wraparound.

       This problem has been fixed.

   <b>memory</b> <b>leak</b> <b>in</b> <b>Encode</b>
       The UTF-8 encoding implementation in Encode.xs had a memory leak which has been fixed.

</pre><h4><b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.16.0. If any exist, they are bugs and reports are
       welcome.

</pre><h4><b>Deprecations</b></h4><pre>
       There have been no deprecations since 5.16.0.

</pre><h4><b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Updated</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b>
       •   Encode has been upgraded from version 2.44 to version 2.44_01.

       •   Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 2.76 to version 2.76_02.

       •   XS::APItest has been upgraded from version 0.38 to version 0.39.

</pre><h4><b>Known</b> <b>Problems</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>Acknowledgements</b></h4><pre>
       Perl 5.16.3 represents approximately 4 months of development since Perl 5.16.2 and contains approximately
       870 lines of changes across 39 files from 7 authors.

       Perl  continues  to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and developers.
       The following people are known to have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.16.3:

       Andy Dougherty, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Dave Rolsky, David Mitchell, Michael Schroeder, Ricardo  Signes,
       Yves Orton.

       The  list  above  is  almost  certainly  incomplete as it is automatically generated from version control
       history. In particular, it does not include the names of the (very  much  appreciated)  contributors  who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       For  a  more  complete  list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see the <u>AUTHORS</u> file in the
       Perl source distribution.

</pre><h4><b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  find  what  you  think  is  a  bug,  you  might  check  the  articles  recently  posted  to  the
       comp.lang.perl.misc  newsgroup and the perl bug database at <a href="http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/">http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/</a> .  There may also
       be information at <a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a> , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with your release.  Be
       sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of
       "perl -V", will be sent off to <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a> to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly
       archived mailing list, then please send it to <a href="mailto:perl5-security-report@perl.org">perl5-security-report@perl.org</a>. This  points  to  a  closed
       subscription  unarchived  mailing  list, which includes all the core committers, who will be able to help
       assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate  the  release  of  patches  to
       mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address
       for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
