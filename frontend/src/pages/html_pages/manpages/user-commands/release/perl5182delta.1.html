       perl5182delta - what is new for perl v5.18.2

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.18.1 release and the 5.18.2 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.18.0, first read perl5181delta, which describes
       differences between 5.18.0 and 5.18.1.

</pre><h4><b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Updated</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b>
       •   B has been upgraded from version 1.42_01 to 1.42_02.

           The  fix  for  [perl  #118525]  introduced a regression in the behaviour of "B::CV::GV", changing the
           return value from a "B::SPECIAL" object on a "NULL" "CvGV" to "undef".  "B::CV::GV" again  returns  a
           "B::SPECIAL" object in this case.  [perl #119413]

       •   B::Concise has been upgraded from version 0.95 to 0.95_01.

           This fixes a bug in dumping unexpected SPECIALs.

       •   English has been upgraded from version 1.06 to 1.06_01.  This fixes an error about the performance of
           "$`", $&amp;, and "$'".

       •   File::Glob has been upgraded from version 1.20 to 1.20_01.

</pre><h4><b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Existing</b> <b>Documentation</b>
       •   perlrepository has been restored with a pointer to more useful pages.

       •   perlhack has been updated with the latest changes from blead.

</pre><h4><b>Selected</b> <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b></h4><pre>
       •   Perl  5.18.1  introduced  a regression along with a bugfix for lexical subs.  Some B::SPECIAL results
           from B::CV::GV became undefs instead.  This broke Devel::Cover among other libraries.  This has  been
           fixed.  [perl #119351]

       •   Perl  5.18.0  introduced  a  regression  whereby "[:^ascii:]", if used in the same character class as
           other qualifiers, would fail to match characters in the Latin-1 block.  This has been  fixed.   [perl
           #120799]

       •   Perl  5.18.0  introduced a regression when using -&gt;SUPER::method with AUTOLOAD by looking up AUTOLOAD
           from the current package, rather than the current package’s superclass.  This has been  fixed.  [perl
           #120694]

       •   Perl  5.18.0  introduced  a regression whereby "-bareword" was no longer permitted under the "strict"
           and "integer" pragmata when used together.  This has been fixed.  [perl #120288]

       •   Previously PerlIOBase_dup didn't check if pushing the new layer succeeded before (optionally) setting
           the utf8 flag. This could cause segfaults-by-nullpointer.  This has been fixed.

       •   A buffer overflow with very long identifiers has been fixed.

       •   A regression from 5.16 in the handling of padranges led to assertion failures  if  a  keyword  plugin
           declined to handle the second ‘my’, but only after creating a padop.

           This affected, at least, Devel::CallParser under threaded builds.

           This has been fixed.

       •   The  construct  "$r=qr/.../;  /$r/p"  is  now  handled  properly, an issue which had been worsened by
           changes 5.18.0. [perl #118213]

</pre><h4><b>Acknowledgements</b></h4><pre>
       Perl 5.18.2 represents approximately 3 months of development since Perl 5.18.1 and contains approximately
       980 lines of changes across 39 files from 4 authors.

       Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users  and  developers.
       The following people are known to have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.18.2:

       Craig A. Berry, David Mitchell, Ricardo Signes, Tony Cook.

       The  list  above  is  almost  certainly  incomplete as it is automatically generated from version control
       history. In particular, it does not include the names of the (very  much  appreciated)  contributors  who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many  of  the  changes  included  in this version originated in the CPAN modules included in Perl's core.
       We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for helping Perl to flourish.

       For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see the  <u>AUTHORS</u>  file  in  the
       Perl source distribution.

</pre><h4><b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  find  what  you  think  is  a  bug,  you  might  check  the  articles  recently  posted  to  the
       comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at <a href="http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/">http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/</a> .  There may  also
       be information at <a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a> , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with your release.  Be
       sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of
       "perl -V", will be sent off to <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a> to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly
       archived  mailing  list,  then please send it to <a href="mailto:perl5-security-report@perl.org">perl5-security-report@perl.org</a>.  This points to a closed
       subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be  able  to  help
       assess  the  impact  of  issues,  figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to
       mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which  Perl  is  supported.   Please  only  use  this
       address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
