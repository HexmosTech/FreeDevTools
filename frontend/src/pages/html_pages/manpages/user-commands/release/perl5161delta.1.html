</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl5161delta - what is new for perl v5.16.1

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.16.0 release and the 5.16.1 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.14.0, first read perl5160delta, which describes
       differences between 5.14.0 and 5.16.0.

</pre><h4><b>Security</b></h4><pre>
   <b>an</b> <b>off-by-two</b> <b>error</b> <b>in</b> <b>Scalar-List-Util</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>fixed</b>
       The bugfix was in Scalar-List-Util 1.23_04, and perl 5.16.1 includes Scalar-List-Util 1.25.

</pre><h4><b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.16.0 If any exist, they are bugs, and we request
       that you submit a report.  See "Reporting Bugs" below.

</pre><h4><b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Updated</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b>
       •   Scalar::Util and List::Util have been upgraded from version 1.23 to version 1.25.

       •   B::Deparse  has  been  updated  from  version 1.14 to 1.14_01.  An "uninitialized" warning emitted by
           B::Deparse has been squashed [perl #113464].

</pre><h4><b>Configuration</b> <b>and</b> <b>Compilation</b></h4><pre>
       •   Building perl with some Windows compilers used to fail  due  to  a  problem  with  miniperl's  "glob"
           operator (which uses the "perlglob" program) deleting the PATH environment variable [perl #113798].

</pre><h4><b>Platform</b> <b>Support</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Platform-Specific</b> <b>Notes</b>
       VMS All  C  header  files  from  the  top-level  directory  of the distribution are now installed on VMS,
           providing consistency with a long-standing practice on other platforms. Previously only a subset were
           installed, which broke non-core extension builds for extensions that depended on the missing  include
           files.

</pre><h4><b>Selected</b> <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b></h4><pre>
       •   A  regression  introduced  in Perl v5.16.0 involving "tr/<u>SEARCHLIST</u>/<u>REPLACEMENTLIST</u>/" has been fixed.
           Only the first instance is supposed to be meaningful  if  a  character  appears  more  than  once  in
           "<u>SEARCHLIST</u>".   Under  some circumstances, the final instance was overriding all earlier ones.  [perl
           #113584]

       •   "B::COP::stashlen" has been added.   This provides access to an internal field  added  in  perl  5.16
           under threaded builds.  It was broken at the last minute before 5.16 was released [perl #113034].

       •   The re pragma will no longer clobber $_. [perl #113750]

       •   Unicode  6.1  published an incorrect alias for one of the Canonical_Combining_Class property's values
           (which range between 0 and 254).  The alias "CCC133" should have been "CCC132".  Perl  now  overrides
           the data file furnished by Unicode to give the correct value.

       •   Duplicating scalar filehandles works again.  [perl #113764]

       •   Under  threaded  perls,  a  runtime code block in a regular expression could corrupt the package name
           stored in the op tree, resulting in bad reads in "caller", and possibly crashes [perl #113060].

       •   For efficiency's sake, many operators and built-in  functions  return  the  same  scalar  each  time.
           Lvalue  subroutines  and subroutines in the CORE:: namespace were allowing this implementation detail
           to leak through.  "print &amp;CORE::uc("a"), &amp;CORE::uc("b")" used to print "BB".  The  same  thing  would
           happen with an lvalue subroutine returning the return value of "uc".  Now the value is copied in such
           cases [perl #113044].

       •   "__SUB__" now works in special blocks ("BEGIN", "END", etc.).

       •   Formats that reference lexical variables from outside no longer result in crashes.

</pre><h4><b>Known</b> <b>Problems</b></h4><pre>
       There are no new known problems, but consult "Known Problems" in perl5160delta to see those identified in
       the 5.16.0 release.

</pre><h4><b>Acknowledgements</b></h4><pre>
       Perl 5.16.1 represents approximately 2 months of development since Perl 5.16.0 and contains approximately
       14,000 lines of changes across 96 files from 8 authors.

       Perl  continues  to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and developers.
       The following people are known to have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.16.1:

       Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Craig A. Berry, Father Chrysostomos, Karl Williamson, Paul Johnson, Reini Urban,
       Ricardo Signes, Tony Cook.

       The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it  is  automatically  generated  from  version  control
       history.  In  particular,  it  does not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN  modules  included  in  Perl's  core.
       We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for helping Perl to flourish.

       For  a  more  complete  list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see the <u>AUTHORS</u> file in the
       Perl source distribution.

</pre><h4><b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  find  what  you  think  is  a  bug,  you  might  check  the  articles  recently  posted  to  the
       comp.lang.perl.misc  newsgroup and the perl bug database at <a href="http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/">http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/</a> .  There may also
       be information at <a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a> , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with your release.  Be
       sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of
       "perl -V", will be sent off to <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a> to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly
       archived mailing list, then please send it to <a href="mailto:perl5-security-report@perl.org">perl5-security-report@perl.org</a>. This  points  to  a  closed
       subscription  unarchived  mailing  list, which includes all the core committers, who will be able to help
       assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate  the  release  of  patches  to
       mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address
       for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
