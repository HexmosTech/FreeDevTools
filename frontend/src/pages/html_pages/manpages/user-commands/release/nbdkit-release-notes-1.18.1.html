</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       nbdkit-release-notes-1.18 - release notes for nbdkit 1.18

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These are the release notes for nbdkit stable release 1.18.  This describes the major changes since 1.16.

       nbdkit 1.18.0 was released on 27th February 2020.

   <b>Security</b>
       There were no security issues found.  All past security issues and information about how to report new
       ones can be found in <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-security.1.html">nbdkit-security</a></b>(1).

   <b>Plugins</b>
       New <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-eval-plugin.1.html">nbdkit-eval-plugin</a></b>(1) lets you write a plugin entirely on a single command line.  It is similar to
       <b><a href="../man3/nbdkit-sh-plugin.3.html">nbdkit-sh-plugin</a></b>(3).

       nbdkit-ext2-plugin is deprecated and will be removed in the next release after this one (nbdkit 1.20).
       As a replacement use <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-ext2-filter.1.html">nbdkit-ext2-filter</a></b>(1) like this:

        nbdkit --filter=ext2 file fs.img ext2file=/disks/disk.raw

       <b><a href="../man3/nbdkit-python-plugin.3.html">nbdkit-python-plugin</a></b>(3) now offers a version 2 API which avoids copying the data buffer, improving
       performance.  The original protocol (now retrospectively called version 1) is still supported for
       backwards compatibility.  The version 1 protocol was also enhanced to support the buffer protocol for the
       pread method, and memoryview for pwrite, improving performance by reducing copies (Nir Soffer).

       The Python plugin now prints readable stack traces when an exception is thrown (Nir Soffer).

       New methods implemented in the Python plugin: cache, can_cache, can_zero, can_fast_zero, can_multi_conn,
       can_fua.

       In <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-curl-plugin.1.html">nbdkit-curl-plugin</a></b>(1), new options "cainfo" and "capath" (Wiktor Gołgowski).

       <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-split-plugin.1.html">nbdkit-split-plugin</a></b>(1) now supports extents (Eric Blake).

       In <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-vddk-plugin.1.html">nbdkit-vddk-plugin</a></b>(1), "file=" is now a magic config key, meaning it can be omitted in most
       circumstances (Eric Blake).

       The VDDK plugin now no longer needs $LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be set.  The correct library load path is
       automatically inferred from the "libdir" parameter (Eric Blake).

       Verbose messages about calls to VDDK functions Read and Write can now be suppressed by setting
       <u>-D</u> <u>vddk.datapath=0</u>.

   <b>Filters</b>
       New <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-ext2-filter.1.html">nbdkit-ext2-filter</a></b>(1), which replaces the deprecated nbdkit-ext2-plugin.  This filter allows you to
       read and write files inside ext2, ext3 or ext4 filesystems.  The new filter has the same features as the
       plugin, and one enhancement: optionally the name of the file to serve can be picked from the client-
       supplied exportname.  The old plugin will be removed in nbdkit 1.20 (Eric Blake).

       New <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-extentlist-filter.1.html">nbdkit-extentlist-filter</a></b>(1) lets you specify a static list of extents from a file which can be placed
       on top of plugins which don't export extent information.

       New <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-ip-filter.1.html">nbdkit-ip-filter</a></b>(1) lets you allow and deny incoming connections by client IP address, similar to TCP
       wrappers or a firewall.

       New <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-nofilter-filter.1.html">nbdkit-nofilter-filter</a></b>(1) is a null filter, used for testing.

       The stats filter now collects time elapsed per operation, per operation and total rates, and adds stats
       for the flush method.  The output is shown in human sizes making it easier to understand.  (Nir Soffer).

   <b>Server</b>
       New <u>--swap</u> option which allows nbdkit to be safely used to serve swap space to the same machine.

       Debug flags (<u>-D</u>) can now be applied to the server core (using <u>-D</u> <u>nbdkit.*</u>).  Underscores in debug flags
       can now be replaced by dots, allowing a kind of namespacing.  Debug flags which are not consumed now no
       longer give an error, so you can use them without needing to detect if the plugin supports them.  New
       server debug flags <u>-D</u> <u>nbdkit.backend.controlpath=0</u> and <u>-D</u> <u>nbdkit.backend.datapath=0</u> were added to
       suppress some very verbose messages when verbose mode is enabled.

   <b>API</b>
       There is a new ".get_ready" method which is called after ".config_complete" and before the server forks
       or changes directory.  It is the last chance to do any global preparation that is needed to serve
       connections.  Plugins have previously done this work in ".config_complete", but by splitting this into a
       new method it makes the API clearer.  (Note that existing plugins may continue to use ".config_complete"
       for this work if they prefer.)

       There is a new ".preconnect" method available which is called just after the client makes a connection
       but before any NBD negotiation or TLS authentication is done.  It can be used for early whitelisting or
       rate limiting of connections, and in particular is used by the new <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-ip-filter.1.html">nbdkit-ip-filter</a></b>(1).

   <b>Bug</b> <b>fixes</b>
       In <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-curl-plugin.1.html">nbdkit-curl-plugin</a></b>(1), "CURLINFO_CONTENT_LENGTH_DOWNLOAD_T" is used (if available) so that file sizes
       up to 63 bits should now work on all platforms (Pino Toscano and Adrian Ambrożewicz).

       nbdkit is now compatible with OCaml 4.10.

       <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-memory-plugin.1.html">nbdkit-memory-plugin</a></b>(1) now supports "size=0" (Eric Blake).

   <b>Documentation</b>
       Plugins which were actually added in nbdkit 1.0.0 are now documented as such properly.

       Improved methods for probing plugins and filters are documented in <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-probing.1.html">nbdkit-probing</a></b>(1).

   <b>Tests</b>
       Old plugins from nbdkit 1.0, 1.2, 1.8 and 1.12 are now bundled with the nbdkit sources and tested to try
       to ensure that they do not accidentally regress.  Note these are included as binary blobs.  See
       <u>tests/old-plugins/README</u> for more information about this, including how to delete these tests.

       Various tests, especially ones which rely on timeouts, have been made more stable so they should not fail
       on slow or overloaded machines.

       Many tests now use libnbd and nbdsh (instead of libguestfs and guestfish) as the test client.  This
       should improve the performance of the tests for most people.

       The <u>--vsock</u> option (added in nbdkit 1.16) can now be tested if the host is running Linux ≥ 5.6 (Stefano
       Garzarella).

   <b>Build</b>
       You can use "./configure --disable-nbd-plugin" to completely disable the NBD plugin.

       The automake feature "subdir-objects" is no longer used, which may improve compatibility on platforms
       with ancient and buggy automake (RHEL 7 being one such platform).

   <b>Internals</b>
       The explicit connection parameter passed around many functions in the server is now fetched from thread-
       local storage.

       The server no longer calls the finalize method if prepare fails.  Also failing to reopen the plugin from
       <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-retry-filter.1.html">nbdkit-retry-filter</a></b>(1) no longer hangs (Eric Blake).

       "git.orderfile" was enhanced to make patches easier to read (Eric Blake).

       Internal calls to methods like get_size, can_write will now no longer produce debug messages <u>if</u> the data
       is simply being returned from the internal cache (but calls into the plugin are still logged).
