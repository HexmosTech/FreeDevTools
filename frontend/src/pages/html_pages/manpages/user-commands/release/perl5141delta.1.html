</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl5141delta - what is new for perl v5.14.1

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.14.0 release and the 5.14.1 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.12.0, first read perl5140delta, which describes
       differences between 5.12.0 and 5.14.0.

</pre><h4><b>Core</b> <b>Enhancements</b></h4><pre>
       No changes since 5.14.0.

</pre><h4><b>Security</b></h4><pre>
       No changes since 5.14.0.

</pre><h4><b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.14.0. If any exist, they are bugs and reports are
       welcome.

</pre><h4><b>Deprecations</b></h4><pre>
       There have been no deprecations since 5.14.0.

</pre><h4><b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b></h4><pre>
   <b>New</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b>
       None

   <b>Updated</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b>
       •   B::Deparse has been upgraded from version 1.03 to 1.04, to address two regressions in Perl 5.14.0:

           Deparsing of the "glob" operator and its diamond ("&lt;&gt;") form now works again. [perl #90898]

           The presence of subroutines named "::::" or "::::::" no longer causes B::Deparse to hang.

       •   Pod::Perldoc has been upgraded from version 3.15_03 to 3.15_04.

           It corrects the search paths on VMS. [perl #90640]

   <b>Removed</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b>
       None

</pre><h4><b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>New</b> <b>Documentation</b>
       None

   <b>Changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Existing</b> <b>Documentation</b>
       <u>perlfunc</u>

       •   "given", "when" and "default" are now listed in perlfunc.

       •   Documentation for "use" now includes a pointer to <u>if.pm</u>.

       <u>perllol</u>

       •   perllol  has  been  expanded  with  examples  using  the new "push $scalar" syntax introduced in Perl
           5.14.0.

       <u>perlop</u>

       •   The explanation of bitwise operators has been expanded to explain how they work on Unicode strings.

       •   The section on the triple-dot or yada-yada operator has been moved up, as it  used  to  separate  two
           closely related sections about the comma operator.

       •   More examples for "m//g" have been added.

       •   The "&lt;&lt;\FOO" here-doc syntax has been documented.

       <u>perlrun</u>

       •   perlrun  has undergone a significant clean-up.  Most notably, the <b>-0x...</b> form of the <b>-0</b> flag has been
           clarified, and the final section on environment variables has been corrected and expanded.

       <u>POSIX</u>

       •   The invocation documentation for "WIFEXITED", "WEXITSTATUS", "WIFSIGNALED", "WTERMSIG", "WIFSTOPPED",
           and "WSTOPSIG" was corrected.

</pre><h4><b>Diagnostics</b></h4><pre>
       The following additions or changes have been made to diagnostic  output,  including  warnings  and  fatal
       error messages.  For the complete list of diagnostic messages, see perldiag.

   <b>New</b> <b>Diagnostics</b>
       None

   <b>Changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Existing</b> <b>Diagnostics</b>
       None

</pre><h4><b>Utility</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       None

</pre><h4><b>Configuration</b> <b>and</b> <b>Compilation</b></h4><pre>
       •   <u>regexp.h</u>  has  been  modified for compatibility with GCC's "-Werror" option, as used by some projects
           that include perl's header files.

</pre><h4><b>Testing</b></h4><pre>
       •   Some  test  failures  in  <u>dist/Locale-Maketext/t/09_compile.t</u>  that  could  occur  depending  on  the
           environment have been fixed. [perl #89896]

       •   A  watchdog  timer  for  <u>t/re/re.t</u>  was  lengthened  to accommodate SH-4 systems which were unable to
           complete the tests before the previous timer ran out.

</pre><h4><b>Platform</b> <b>Support</b></h4><pre>
   <b>New</b> <b>Platforms</b>
       None

   <b>Discontinued</b> <b>Platforms</b>
       None

   <b>Platform-Specific</b> <b>Notes</b>
       <u>Solaris</u>

       •   Documentation listing the Solaris packages required to build Perl on Solaris 9  and  Solaris  10  has
           been corrected.

       <u>Mac</u> <u>OS</u> <u>X</u>

       •   The <u>lib/locale.t</u> test script has been updated to work on the upcoming Lion release.

       •   Mac OS X specific compilation instructions have been clarified.

       <u>Ubuntu</u> <u>Linux</u>

       •   The ODBM_File installation process has been updated with the new library paths on Ubuntu natty.

</pre><h4><b>Internal</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       •   The  compiled  representation  of  formats  is  now  stored  via  the  mg_ptr of their PERL_MAGIC_fm.
           Previously it was stored in the string buffer,  beyond  <b>SvLEN()</b>,  the  regular  end  of  the  string.
           <b>SvCOMPILED()</b>  and SvCOMPILED_{on,off}() now exist solely for compatibility for XS code.  The first is
           always 0, the other two now no-ops.

</pre><h4><b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b></h4><pre>
       •   A bug has been fixed that would cause a "Use of freed value in iteration" error if the next two  hash
           elements that would be iterated over are deleted. [perl #85026]

       •   Passing the same constant subroutine to both "index" and "formline" no longer causes one or the other
           to fail. [perl #89218]

       •   5.14.0  introduced  some memory leaks in regular expression character classes such as "[\w\s]", which
           have now been fixed.

       •   An edge case in regular expression matching could potentially loop.  This happened only under "/i" in
           bracketed character classes that have characters with multi-character folds, and the target string to
           match against includes the first portion of the fold, followed by another character that has a multi-
           character fold that begins with the remaining portion of the fold, plus some more.

            "s\N{U+DF}" =~ /[\x{DF}foo]/i

           is one such case.  "\xDF" folds to "ss".

       •   Several Unicode case-folding bugs have been fixed.

       •   The new (in 5.14.0) regular expression modifier "/a" when repeated like "/aa" forbids the  characters
           outside  the  ASCII range that match characters inside that range from matching under "/i".  This did
           not work under some circumstances, all involving alternation, such as:

            "\N{KELVIN SIGN}" =~ /k|foo/iaa;

           succeeded inappropriately.  This is now fixed.

       •   Fixed a case where it was possible that a freed buffer may have been read from when  parsing  a  here
           document.

</pre><h4><b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  find  what  you  think  is  a  bug,  you  might  check  the  articles  recently  posted  to  the
       comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at <a href="http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/">http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/</a> .  There may  also
       be information at <a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a> , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with your release.  Be
       sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of
       "perl -V", will be sent off to <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a> to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly
       archived  mailing  list,  then  please send it to <a href="mailto:perl5-security-report@perl.org">perl5-security-report@perl.org</a>. This points to a closed
       subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able to help  assess
       the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or
       fix  the  problem  across  all  platforms  on  which  Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
       security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
