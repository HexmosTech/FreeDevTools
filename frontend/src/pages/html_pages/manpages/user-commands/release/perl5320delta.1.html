</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl5320delta - what is new for perl v5.32.0

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.30.0 release and the 5.32.0 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.28.0, first read perl5300delta, which describes
       differences between 5.28.0 and 5.30.0.

</pre><h4><b>Core</b> <b>Enhancements</b></h4><pre>
   <b>The</b> <b>isa</b> <b>Operator</b>
       A new experimental infix operator called "isa" tests whether a given object is an instance of a given
       class or a class derived from it:

           if( $obj isa Package::Name ) { ... }

       For more detail see "Class Instance Operator" in perlop.

   <b>Unicode</b> <b>13.0</b> <b>is</b> <b>supported</b>
       See &lt;https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/&gt; for details.

   <b>Chained</b> <b>comparisons</b> <b>capability</b>
       Some comparison operators, as their associativity, <u>chain</u> with some operators of the same precedence (but
       never with operators of different precedence).

           if ( $x &lt; $y &lt;= $z ) {...}

       behaves exactly like:

           if ( $x &lt; $y &amp;&amp; $y &lt;= $z ) {...}

       (assuming that "$y" is as simple a scalar as it looks.)

       You can read more about this in perlop under "Operator Precedence and Associativity" in perlop.

   <b>New</b> <b>Unicode</b> <b>properties</b> <b>"Identifier_Status"</b> <b>and</b> <b>"Identifier_Type"</b> <b>supported</b>
       Unicode has revised its regular expression requirements:
       &lt;https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr18/tr18-21.html&gt;.  As part of that they are wanting more properties to
       be exposed, ones that aren't part of the strict UCD (Unicode character database). These two are used for
       examining inputs for security purposes. Details on their usage is at
       &lt;https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/&gt;.

   <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>"qr/\p{Name=...}/",</b> <b>or</b> <b>"qr!\p{na=/(SMILING|GRINNING)</b> <b>FACE/}!"</b>
       The Unicode Name property is now accessible in regular expression patterns, as an alternative to
       "\N{...}".  A comparison of the two methods is given in "Comparison of \N{...} and \p{name=...}" in
       perlunicode.

       The second example above shows that wildcard subpatterns are also usable in this property. See "Wildcards
       in Property Values" in perlunicode.

   <b>Improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>POSIX::mblen(),</b> <b>"mbtowc",</b> <b>and</b> <b>"wctomb"</b>
       The POSIX::mblen(), "mbtowc", and "wctomb" functions now work on shift state locales and are thread-safe
       on C99 and above compilers when executed on a platform that has locale thread-safety; the length
       parameters are now optional.

       These functions are always executed under the current C language locale.  (See perllocale.)  Most locales
       are stateless, but a few, notably the very rarely encountered ISO 2022, maintain a state between calls to
       these functions. Previously the state was cleared on every call, but now the state is not reset unless
       the appropriate parameter is "undef".

       On threaded perls, the C99 functions <b><a href="../man3/mbrlen.3.html">mbrlen</a></b>(3), <b><a href="../man3/mbrtowc.3.html">mbrtowc</a></b>(3), and <b><a href="../man3/wcrtomb.3.html">wcrtomb</a></b>(3), when available, are
       substituted for the plain functions.  This makes these functions thread-safe when executing on a locale
       thread-safe platform.

       The string length parameters in "mblen" and "mbtowc" are now optional; useful only if you wish to
       restrict the length parsed in the source string to less than the actual length.

   <b>Alpha</b> <b>assertions</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>experimental</b>
       See "(*pla:pattern)" in perlre, "(*plb:pattern)" in perlre, "(*nla:pattern)" in perlre&gt;, and
       "(*nlb:pattern)" in perlre.  Use of these no longer generates a warning; existing code that disables the
       warning category "experimental::alpha_assertions" will continue to work without any changes needed.
       Enabling the category has no effect.

   <b>Script</b> <b>runs</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>experimental</b>
       See "Script Runs" in perlre. Use of these no longer generates a warning; existing code that disables the
       warning category "experimental::script_run" will continue to work without any changes needed. Enabling
       the category has no effect.

   <b>Feature</b> <b>checks</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>faster</b>
       Previously feature checks in the parser required a hash lookup when features were set outside of a
       feature bundle, this has been optimized to a bit mask check. [GH #17229
       &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17229&gt;]

   <b>Perl</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>developed</b> <b>on</b> <b>GitHub</b>
       Perl is now developed on GitHub. You can find us at &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5&gt;.

       Non-security bugs should now be reported via GitHub. Security issues should continue to be reported as
       documented in perlsec.

   <b>Compiled</b> <b>patterns</b> <b>can</b> <b>now</b> <b>be</b> <b>dumped</b> <b>before</b> <b>optimization</b>
       This is primarily useful for tracking down bugs in the regular expression compiler. This dump happens on
       "-DDEBUGGING" perls, if you specify "-Drv" on the command line; or on any perl if the pattern is compiled
       within the scope of "use re qw(Debug DUMP_PRE_OPTIMIZE)" or "use re qw(Debug COMPILE EXTRA)". (All but
       the second case display other information as well.)

</pre><h4><b>Security</b></h4><pre>
   <b>[CVE-2020-10543]</b> <b>Buffer</b> <b>overflow</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>crafted</b> <b>regular</b> <b>expression</b>
       A signed "size_t" integer overflow in the storage space calculations for nested regular expression
       quantifiers could cause a heap buffer overflow in Perl's regular expression compiler that overwrites
       memory allocated after the regular expression storage space with attacker supplied data.

       The target system needs a sufficient amount of memory to allocate partial expansions of the nested
       quantifiers prior to the overflow occurring.  This requirement is unlikely to be met on 64-bit systems.

       Discovered by: ManhND of The Tarantula Team, VinCSS (a member of Vingroup).

   <b>[CVE-2020-10878]</b> <b>Integer</b> <b>overflow</b> <b>via</b> <b>malformed</b> <b>bytecode</b> <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>crafted</b> <b>regular</b> <b>expression</b>
       Integer overflows in the calculation of offsets between instructions for the regular expression engine
       could cause corruption of the intermediate language state of a compiled regular expression.  An attacker
       could abuse this behaviour to insert instructions into the compiled form of a Perl regular expression.

       Discovered by: Hugo van der Sanden and Slaven Rezic.

   <b>[CVE-2020-12723]</b> <b>Buffer</b> <b>overflow</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>crafted</b> <b>regular</b> <b>expression</b>
       Recursive calls to S_study_chunk() by Perl's regular expression compiler to optimize the intermediate
       language representation of a regular expression could cause corruption of the intermediate language state
       of a compiled regular expression.

       Discovered by: Sergey Aleynikov.

   <b>Additional</b> <b>Note</b>
       An application written in Perl would only be vulnerable to any of the above flaws if it evaluates regular
       expressions supplied by the attacker.  Evaluating regular expressions in this fashion is known to be
       dangerous since the regular expression engine does not protect against denial of service attacks in this
       usage scenario.

</pre><h4><b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Certain</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>matching</b> <b>features</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>prohibited</b> <b>in</b> <b>compiling</b> <b>Unicode</b> <b>property</b> <b>value</b> <b>wildcard</b> <b>subpatterns</b>

       These few features are either inappropriate or interfere with the algorithm used to accomplish this task.
       The complete list is in "Wildcards in Property Values" in perlunicode.

   <b>Unused</b> <b>functions</b> <b>"POSIX::mbstowcs"</b> <b>and</b> <b>"POSIX::wcstombs"</b> <b>are</b> <b>removed</b>
       These functions could never have worked due to a defective interface specification. There is clearly no
       demand for them, given that no one has ever complained in the many years the functions were claimed to be
       available, hence so-called "support" for them is now dropped.

   <b>A</b> <b>bug</b> <b>fix</b> <b>for</b> <b>"(?[...])"</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> <b>some</b> <b>patterns</b> <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>compile</b>
       See "Selected Bug Fixes". The heuristics previously used may have let some constructs compile (perhaps
       not with the programmer's intended effect) that should have been errors. None are known, but it is
       possible that some erroneous constructs no longer compile.

   <b>"\p{</b><u><b>user-defined</b></u><b>}"</b> <b>properties</b> <b>now</b> <b>always</b> <b>override</b> <b>official</b> <b>Unicode</b> <b>ones</b>
       Previously, if and only if a user-defined property was declared prior to the compilation of the regular
       expression pattern that contains it, its definition was used instead of any official Unicode property
       with the same name. Now, it always overrides the official property. This change could break existing code
       that relied (likely unwittingly) on the previous behavior. Without this fix, if Unicode released a new
       version with a new property that happens to have the same name as the one you had long been using, your
       program would break when you upgraded to a perl that used that new Unicode version. See "User-Defined
       Character Properties" in perlunicode. [GH #17205 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17205&gt;]

   <b>Modifiable</b> <b>variables</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>permitted</b> <b>in</b> <b>constants</b>
       Code like:

           my $var;
           $sub = sub () { $var };

       where $var is referenced elsewhere in some sort of modifiable context now produces an exception when the
       sub is defined.

       This error can be avoided by adding a return to the sub definition:

           $sub = sub () { return $var };

       This has been deprecated since Perl 5.22.  [GH #17020] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17020&gt;

   <b>Use</b> <b>of</b> <b>"vec"</b> <b>on</b> <b>strings</b> <b>with</b> <b>code</b> <b>points</b> <b>above</b> <b>0xFF</b> <b>is</b> <b>forbidden</b>
       Such strings are represented internally in UTF-8, and "vec" is a bit-oriented operation that will likely
       give unexpected results on those strings. This was deprecated in perl 5.28.0.

   <b>Use</b> <b>of</b> <b>code</b> <b>points</b> <b>over</b> <b>0xFF</b> <b>in</b> <b>string</b> <b>bitwise</b> <b>operators</b>
       Some uses of these were already illegal after a previous deprecation cycle. The remaining uses are now
       prohibited, having been deprecated in perl 5.28.0. See perldeprecation.

   <b>Sys::Hostname::hostname()</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> <b>arguments</b>
       This usage was deprecated in perl 5.28.0 and is now fatal.

   <b>Plain</b> <b>"0"</b> <b>string</b> <b>now</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>for</b> <b>range</b> <b>operator</b>
       Previously a range "0" .. "-1" would produce a range of numeric strings from "0" through "99"; this now
       produces an empty list, just as "0 .. -1" does. This also means that "0" .. "9" now produces a list of
       integers, where previously it would produce a list of strings.

       This was due to a special case that treated strings starting with "0" as strings so ranges like "00" ..
       "03" produced "00", "01", "02", "03", but didn't specially handle the string "0".  [GH #16770]
       &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16770&gt;

   <b>"\K"</b> <b>now</b> <b>disallowed</b> <b>in</b> <b>look-ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>look-behind</b> <b>assertions</b>
       This was disallowed because it causes unexpected behaviour, and no-one could define what the desired
       behaviour should be.  [GH #14638] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14638&gt;

           CPAN. This resolves [#13194 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/13194&gt;].

</pre><h4><b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Existing</b> <b>Documentation</b>
       We have attempted to update the documentation to reflect the changes listed in this document. If you find
       any we have missed, open an issue at &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues&gt;.

       Additionally, the following selected changes have been made:

       <u>perldebguts</u>

       •   Simplify a few regnode definitions

           Update "BOUND" and "NBOUND" definitions.

       •   Add ANYOFHs regnode

           This node is like "ANYOFHb", but is used when more than one leading byte  is  the  same  in  all  the
           matched code points.

           "ANYOFHb" is used to avoid having to convert from UTF-8 to code point for something that won't match.
           It checks that the first byte in the UTF-8 encoded target is the desired one, thus ruling out most of
           the possible code points.

       <u>perlapi</u>

       •   "sv_2pvbyte" updated to mention it will croak if the SV cannot be downgraded.

       •   "sv_setpvn"  updated  to  mention  that  the  UTF-8  flag will not be changed by this function, and a
           terminating NUL byte is guaranteed.

       •   Documentation for "PL_phase" has been added.

       •   The documentation for "grok_bin", "grok_oct", and "grok_hex" has been updated and clarified.

       <u>perldiag</u>

       •   Add documentation for experimental 'isa' operator

           (S experimental::isa) This warning is emitted if you use  the  ("isa")  operator.  This  operator  is
           currently experimental and its behaviour may change in future releases of Perl.

       <u>perlfunc</u>

       "caller"
           Like  "__FILE__"  and  "__LINE__",  the  filename and line number returned here may be altered by the
           mechanism described at "Plain Old Comments (Not!)" in perlsyn.

       "__FILE__"
           It can be altered by the mechanism described at "Plain Old Comments (Not!)" in perlsyn.

       "__LINE__"
           It can be altered by the mechanism described at "Plain Old Comments (Not!)" in perlsyn.

       "return"
           Now mentions that you cannot return from "do BLOCK".

       "open"
           The open() section had been renovated significantly.

       <u>perlguts</u>

       •   No longer suggesting using perl's "malloc". Modern system "malloc" is assumed to be much better  than
           perl's implementation now.

       •   Documentation  about  <u>embed.fnc</u>  flags has been removed. <u>embed.fnc</u> now has sufficient comments within
           it. Anyone changing that file will see those comments first, so entries here are now redundant.

       •   Updated documentation for "UTF8f"

       •   Added missing "=for apidoc" lines

       <u>perlhacktips</u>

       •   The differences between Perl strings and C strings are now detailed.

       <u>perlintro</u>

       •   The  documentation  for  the   repetition   operator   "x"   have   been   clarified.    [GH   #17335
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17335&gt;]

       <u>perlipc</u>

       •   The  documentation  surrounding  "open" and handle usage has been modernized to prefer 3-arg open and
           lexical variables instead of barewords.

       •   Various updates and fixes including making all examples strict-safe  and  replacing  "-w"  with  "use
           warnings".

       <u>perlop</u>

       •   'isa' operator is experimental

           This  is  an  experimental  feature  and is available when enabled by "use feature 'isa'". It emits a
           warning in the "experimental::isa" category.

       <u>perlpod</u>

       •   Details of the various stacks within the perl interpreter are now explained here.

       •   Advice has been added regarding the usage of "Z&lt;&gt;".

       <u>perlport</u>

       •   Update  "timegm"  example  to  use  the  correct  year  format  <u>1970</u>  instead  of  <u>70</u>.   [GH   #16431
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16431&gt;]

       <u>perlreref</u>

       •   Fix some typos.

       <u>perlvar</u>

       •   Now recommends stringifying $] and comparing it numerically.

       <u>perlapi,</u> <u>perlintern</u>

       •   Documentation has been added for several functions that were lacking it before.

       <u>perlxs</u>

       •   Suggest using "libffi" for simple library bindings via CPAN modules like FFI::Platypus or FFI::Raw.

       <u>POSIX</u>

       •   "setlocale" warning about threaded builds updated to note it does not apply on Perl 5.28.X and later.

       •   "Posix::SigSet-&gt;new(...)"  updated  to state it throws an error if any of the supplied signals cannot
           be added to the set.

       Additionally, the following selected changes have been made:

       <u>Updating</u> <u>of</u> <u>links</u>

       •   Links  to  the  now  defunct   &lt;https://search.cpan.org&gt;   site   now   point   at   the   equivalent
           &lt;https://metacpan.org&gt; URL. [GH #17393 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17393&gt;]

       •   The  man  page  for  ExtUtils::XSSymSet  is now only installed on VMS, which is the only platform the
           module is installed on. [GH #17424 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17424&gt;]

       •   URLs have been changed to "https://" and stale links have been updated.

           Where applicable, the URLs in the documentation have been moved from using the "http://" protocol  to
           "https://". This also affects the location of the bug tracker at &lt;https://rt.perl.org&gt;.

       •   Some  links  to  OS/2  libraries, Address Sanitizer and other system tools had gone stale. These have
           been updated with working links.

       •   Some links to old email addresses on perl5-porters had gone  stale.  These  have  been  updated  with
           working links.

</pre><h4><b>Diagnostics</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  additions  or  changes  have been made to diagnostic output, including warnings and fatal
       error messages. For the complete list of diagnostic messages, see perldiag.

   <b>New</b> <b>Diagnostics</b>
       <u>New</u> <u>Errors</u>

       •   Expecting interpolated extended charclass in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/

           This is a replacement for several error messages listed under "Changes to Existing Diagnostics".

       •   "No digits found for %s literal"

           (F) No hexadecimal digits were found following "0x" or no binary digits were found following "0b".

       <u>New</u> <u>Warnings</u>

       •   Code point 0x%X is not Unicode, and not portable

           This is actually not a new message, but it is now output when the  warnings  category  "portable"  is
           enabled.

           When  raised  during  regular expression pattern compilation, the warning has extra text added at the
           end marking where precisely in the pattern it occurred.

       •   Non-hex character '%c' terminates \x early.  Resolved as "%s"

           This replaces a warning that was much less specific, and  which  gave  false  information.  This  new
           warning parallels the similar already-existing one raised for "\o{}".

   <b>Changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Existing</b> <b>Diagnostics</b>
       •   Character following "\c" must be printable ASCII

           ...now  has  extra  text added at the end, when raised during regular expression pattern compilation,
           marking where precisely in the pattern it occurred.

       •   Use "%s" instead of "%s"

           ...now has extra text added at the end, when raised during regular  expression  pattern  compilation,
           marking where precisely in the pattern it occurred.

       •   Sequence "\c{" invalid

           ...now  has  extra  text added at the end, when raised during regular expression pattern compilation,
           marking where precisely in the pattern it occurred.

       •   "\c%c" is more clearly written simply as "%s"

           ...now has extra text added at the end, when raised during regular  expression  pattern  compilation,
           marking where precisely in the pattern it occurred.

       •   Non-octal character '%c' terminates \o early.  Resolved as "%s"

           ...now  includes  the  phrase "terminates \o early", and has extra text added at the end, when raised
           during regular expression pattern compilation, marking where precisely in the pattern it occurred. In
           some instances the text of the resolution has been clarified.

       •   '%s' resolved to '\o{%s}%d'

           As of Perl 5.32, this message is no longer generated. Instead, "Non-octal character  '%c'  terminates
           \o early.  Resolved as "%s"" in perldiag is used instead.

       •   Use of code point 0x%s is not allowed; the permissible max is 0x%X

           Some  instances  of this message previously output the hex digits "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", and "F" in
           lower case. Now they are all consistently upper case.

       •   The following three diagnostics have been removed, and replaced by "Expecting  interpolated  extended
           charclass  in  regex;  marked  by  &lt;--  HERE  in  m/%s/" : "Expecting close paren for nested extended
           charclass in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/", "Expecting  close  paren  for  wrapper  for  nested
           extended  charclass in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/", and "Expecting '(?flags:(?[...' in regex;
           marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/".

       •   The "Code point 0x%X is not Unicode, and not portable" warning removed the line  "Code  points  above
           0xFFFF_FFFF  require  larger  than  a 32 bit word."  as code points that large are no longer legal on
           32-bit platforms.

       •   Can't use global %s in %s

           This error message has been slightly reformatted from the original "Can't use global %s in "%s"", and
           in particular misleading error messages like "Can't use global $_ in "my"" are now rendered as "Can't
           use global $_ in subroutine signature".

       •   Constants from lexical variables potentially modified elsewhere are no longer permitted

           This error message  replaces  the  former  Constants  from  lexical  variables  potentially  modified
           elsewhere  are  deprecated.  This  will  not  be  allowed  in Perl 5.32 to reflect the fact that this
           previously deprecated usage has now been transformed into an exception. The message's  classification
           has also been updated from D (deprecated) to F (fatal).

           See also "Incompatible Changes".

       •   "\N{}  here is restricted to one character" is now emitted in the same circumstances where previously
           "\N{} in inverted character class or as a range end-point is restricted to one character" was.

           This is due to new circumstances having been added in Perl 5.30 that weren't covered by  the  earlier
           wording.

</pre><h4><b>Utility</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
   <b>perlbug</b>
       •   The bug tracker homepage URL now points to GitHub.

   <b>streamzip</b>
       •   This is a new utility, included as part of an IO::Compress::Base upgrade.

           streamzip  creates  a  zip file from stdin. The program will read data from stdin, compress it into a
           zip container and, by default, write a streamed zip file to stdout.

</pre><h4><b>Configuration</b> <b>and</b> <b>Compilation</b></h4><pre>
   <u><b>Configure</b></u>
       •   For clang++, add "#include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdlib.h">stdlib.h</a>&gt;" to Configure's probes  for  "futimes",  "strtoll",  "strtoul",
           "strtoull", "strtouq", otherwise the probes would fail to compile.

       •   Use a compile and run test for "lchown" to satisfy clang++ which should more reliably detect it.

       •   For C++ compilers, add "#include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdio.h">stdio.h</a>&gt;" to Configure's probes for "getpgrp" and "setpgrp" as they
           use printf and C++ compilers may fail compilation instead of just warning.

       •   Check if the compiler can handle inline attribute.

       •   Check for character data alignment.

       •   <u>Configure</u>  now  correctly  handles  gcc-10.  Previously it was interpreting it as gcc-1 and turned on
           "-fpcc-struct-return".

       •   Perl now no longer probes for "d_u32align", defaulting to "define" on all platforms. This  check  was
           error-prone   when   it   was   done,   which   was   on   32-bit   platforms   only.    [GH  #16680]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16680&gt;

       •   Documentation and hints for building perl on Z/OS (native EBCDIC) have been updated. This is still  a
           work in progress.

       •   A new probe for "malloc_usable_size" has been added.

       •   Improvements  in  <u>Configure</u>  to  detection  in  C++  and clang++. Work ongoing by Andy Dougherty. [GH
           #17033] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17033&gt;

       •   <u>autodoc.pl</u>

           This tool that regenerates perlintern  and  perlapi  has  been  overhauled  significantly,  restoring
           consistency in flags used in <u>embed.fnc</u> and Devel::PPPort and allowing removal of many redundant "=for
           apidoc" entries in code.

       •   The  "ECHO"  macro  is  now  defined. This is used in a "dtrace" rule that was originally changed for
           FreeBSD, and the FreeBSD make apparently predefines it.  The Solaris make does not  predefine  "ECHO"
           which broke this rule on Solaris.  [GH #17057] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17057&gt;

       •   Bison versions 3.1 through 3.4 are now supported.

</pre><h4><b>Testing</b></h4><pre>
       Tests  were  added  and  changed to reflect the other additions and changes in this release. Furthermore,
       these significant changes were made:

       •   <u>t/run/switches.t</u> no longer uses (and re-uses) the <u>tmpinplace/</u> directory under <u>t/</u>.  This  may  prevent
           spurious failures. [GH #17424 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17424&gt;]

       •   Various  bugs  in "POSIX::mbtowc" were fixed. Potential races with other threads are now avoided, and
           previously the returned wide character could well be garbage.

       •   Various bugs in "POSIX::wctomb" were fixed. Potential races with other threads are now  avoided,  and
           previously  it  would segfault if the string parameter was shared or hadn't been pre-allocated with a
           string of sufficient length to hold the result.

       •   Certain test output of scalars containing control characters and Unicode has been fixed on EBCDIC.

       •   <u>t/charset_tools.pl</u>: Avoid some work on ASCII platforms.

       •   <u>t/re/regexp.t</u>: Speed up many regex tests on ASCII platform

       •   <u>t/re/pat.t</u>: Skip tests that don't work on EBCDIC.

</pre><h4><b>Platform</b> <b>Support</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Discontinued</b> <b>Platforms</b>
       Windows CE
           Support for building perl on Windows CE has now been removed.

   <b>Platform-Specific</b> <b>Notes</b>
       Linux
           "cc"   will   be   used   to   populate   "plibpth"   if    "cc"    is    "clang".     [GH    #17043]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17043&gt;

       NetBSD 8.0
           Fix      compilation      of     Perl     on     NetBSD     8.0     with     g++.      [GH     #17381
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17381&gt;]

       Windows
           •   The configuration for "ccflags" and "optimize" are now separate, as  with  POSIX  platforms.  [GH
               #17156 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17156&gt;]

           •   Support for building perl with Visual C++ 6.0 has now been removed.

           •   The  locale  tests  could  crash  on  Win32  due  to a Windows bug, and separately due to the CRT
               throwing an exception if the locale name wasn't validly encoded in the current code page.

               For the second we now decode the locale name ourselves,  and  always  decode  it  as  UTF-8.  [GH
               #16922] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16922&gt;

           •   <u>t/op/magic.t</u> could fail if environment variables starting with "FOO" already existed.

           •   MYMALLOC (PERL_MALLOC) build has been fixed.

       Solaris
           •   "Configure"  will  now  find  recent  versions of the Oracle Developer Studio compiler, which are
               found under "/opt/developerstudio*".

           •   "Configure" now uses the detected types for "gethostby*" functions, allowing Perl to  once  again
               compile on certain configurations of Solaris.

       VMS
           •   With  the release of the patch kit C99 V2.0, VSI has provided support for a number of previously-
               missing C99 features. On systems with that patch kit installed, Perl's configuration process will
               now detect the presence of the header  "stdint.h"  and  the  following  functions:  "fpclassify",
               "isblank",  "isless", "llrint", "llrintl", "llround", "llroundl", "nearbyint", "round", "scalbn",
               and "scalbnl".

           •   "-Duse64bitint" is now the default on VMS.

       z/OS
           Perl 5.32 has been tested on z/OS 2.4, with the following caveats:

           •   Only static builds (the default) build reliably

           •   When using locales, z/OS does not handle the "LC_MESSAGES" category properly, so  when  compiling
               perl, you should add the following to your <u>Configure</u> options

                ./Configure &lt;other options&gt; -Accflags=-DNO_LOCALE_MESSAGES

           •   z/OS does not support locales with threads, so when compiling a threaded perl, you should add the
               following to your <u>Configure</u> options

                ./Configure &lt;other Configure options&gt; -Accflags=-DNO_LOCALE

           •   Some  CPAN  modules that are shipped with perl fail at least one of their self-tests.  These are:
               Archive::Tar, Config::Perl::V, CPAN::Meta, CPAN::Meta::YAML,  Digest::MD5,  Digest::SHA,  Encode,
               ExtUtils::MakeMaker,  ExtUtils::Manifest,  HTTP::Tiny,  IO::Compress, IPC::Cmd, JSON::PP, libnet,
               MIME::Base64, Module::Metadata, PerlIO::via-QuotedPrint,  Pod::Checker,  podlators,  Pod::Simple,
               Socket, and Test::Harness.

               The  causes  of  the  failures range from the self-test itself is flawed, and the module actually
               works fine, up to the module doesn't work at all on EBCDIC platforms.

</pre><h4><b>Internal</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       •   "savepvn"'s len parameter is now a "Size_t" instead of an "I32" since we can  handle  longer  strings
           than 31 bits.

       •   The  lexer  (Perl_yylex()  in  <u>toke.c</u>) was previously a single 4100-line function, relying heavily on
           "goto" and a lot of widely-scoped local variables to do its work. It has now been pulled apart into a
           few dozen smaller static functions; the largest remaining chunk (yyl_word_or_keyword()) is  a  little
           over  900  lines,  and  consists  of  a  single  "switch"  statement,  all of whose "case" groups are
           independent. This should be much easier to understand and maintain.

       •   The OS-level signal handlers and type (Sighandler_t) used by the perl core were  declared  as  having
           three  parameters,  but the OS was always told to call them with one argument. This has been fixed by
           declaring them to have one  parameter.  See  the  merge  commit  "v5.31.5-346-g116e19abbf"  for  full
           details.

       •   The  code that handles "tr///" has been extensively revised, fixing various bugs, especially when the
           source and/or replacement strings contain characters whose code points are above  255.  Some  of  the
           bugs  were  undocumented,  one  being  that  under  some  circumstances  (but not all) with "/s", the
           squeezing was done based on the source, rather than the replacement. A documented bug that got  fixed
           was [GH #14777] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14777&gt;.

       •   A   new   macro  for  XS  writers  dealing  with  UTF-8-encoded  Unicode  strings  has  been  created
           ""UTF8_CHK_SKIP"" in perlapi that is safer in the face of malformed UTF-8 input than ""UTF8_SKIP"" in
           perlapi (but not as safe as ""UTF8_SAFE_SKIP"" in perlapi). It won't read past a NUL  character.   It
           has been backported in Devel::PPPort 3.55 and later.

       •   Added  the  "PL_curstackinfo-&gt;si_cxsubix"  field.  This  records the stack index of the most recently
           pushed sub/format/eval context. It is set and restored  automatically  by  cx_pushsub(),  cx_popsub()
           etc., but would need to be manually managed if you do any unusual manipulation of the context stack.

       •   Various  macros  dealing  with  character  type  classification  and changing case where the input is
           encoded in UTF-8 now require an extra parameter to prevent potential reads  beyond  the  end  of  the
           buffer. Use of these has generated a deprecation warning since Perl 5.26. Details are in "In XS code,
           use of various macros dealing with UTF-8." in perldeprecation

       •   A  new  parser  function <b>parse_subsignature()</b> allows a keyword plugin to parse a subroutine signature
           while use feature 'signatures' is in effect. This  allows  custom  keywords  to  implement  semantics
           similar    to    regular    "sub"    declarations    that    include    signatures.     [GH   #16261]

       •   Since on some platforms we need to hold a  mutex  when  temporarily  switching  locales,  new  macros

       •   The  memory bookkeeping overhead for allocating an OP structure has been reduced by 8 bytes per OP on
           64-bit systems.

       •   <b>eval_pv()</b>       no       longer       stringifies        the        exception        when        "[GH

       •   The  PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL  environment variable was formerly only honoured on perl binaries built with
           DEBUGGING support. It is now checked on all perl  builds.   Its  normal  use  is  to  force  perl  to
           individually  free  every block of memory which it has allocated before exiting, which is useful when
           using automated leak detection tools such as valgrind.

       •   The API <b>eval_sv()</b> now accepts a "G_RETHROW" flag. If this flag is set  and  an  exception  is  thrown
           while  compiling  or executing the supplied code, it will be rethrown, and <b>eval_sv()</b> will not return.
           [GH #17036] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17036&gt;

       •   As part of the  fix  for  [GH  #1537]  &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/1537&gt;  <b>perl_parse()</b>  now
           returns non-zero if <b><a href="../man0/exit.0.html">exit</a></b>(0) is called in a "BEGIN", "UNITCHECK" or "CHECK" block.

       •   Most  functions  which recursively walked an op tree during compilation have been made non-recursive.
           This avoids SEGVs from stack overflow when the op tree is deeply nested, such as "$n == 1 ?  "one"  :
           $n == 2 ? "two" : ...." (especially in code which is auto-generated).

           This  is particularly noticeable where the code is compiled within a separate thread, as threads tend
           to have small stacks by default.

       •   Previously "require" in perlfunc would only treat the special built-in SV &amp;PL_sv_undef as a value  in
           %INC as if a previous "require" has failed, treating other undefined SVs as if the previous "require"
           has succeeded. This could cause unexpected success from "require" e.g., on "local %INC = %INC;". This

       •   Perl no longer treats strings starting with "0x" or "0b" as hex or binary numbers  respectively  when

       •   "[GH #17108]|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17108"]

       •   Exceptions thrown while $@ is read-only could result in infinite recursion as perl  tried  to  update

       •   <b>close()</b>  on  a  pipe now preemptively clears the PerlIO object from the IO SV. This prevents a second

       •   Parsing  the  following  constructs  within  a  sub-parse (such as with "${code here}" or "s/.../code
           here/e") has changed to match how they're parsed normally:

           •   "print $fh ..." no longer produces a syntax error.

           •   Code like "s/.../ ${time} /e" now properly produces an "Ambiguous  use  of  ${time}  resolved  to
               $time at ..." warning when warnings are enabled.

           •   "@x  {"a"}"  (with  the space) in a sub-parse now properly produces a "better written as" warning
               when warnings are enabled.

           •   Attributes     can     now     be      used      in      a      sub-parse.       [GH      #16847]

       •   A spurious ")" in a subparse, such as in "s/.../code here/e" or "...${code here}", no longer confuses
           the parser.

           Previously  a subparse was bracketed with generated "(" and ")" tokens, so a spurious ")" would close
           the construct without doing the normal subparse clean up, confusing the parser and  possible  causing
           an assertion failure.

           Such  constructs  are  now  surrounded by artificial tokens that can't be included in the source. [GH

           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16960&gt;

       •   "readline @foo" now evaluates @foo in scalar context.  Previously  it  would  be  evaluated  in  list
           context, and since <b>readline()</b> pops only one argument from the stack, the stack could underflow, or be
           left with unexpected values on the stack. [GH #16929] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16929&gt;

       •   Parsing  incomplete  hex or binary literals was changed in 5.31.1 to treat such a literal as just the
           0, leaving the following "x" or "b" to be parsed as part of the next token. This could lead  to  some
           silent  changes  in  behaviour,  so now incomplete hex or binary literals produce a fatal error.  [GH
           #17010] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17010&gt;

       •   <b>eval_pv()</b>'s <u>croak_on_error</u> flag will now throw even if the exception is  a  false  overloaded  value.
           [GH #17036] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17036&gt;

       •   "INIT"  blocks  and  the  program  itself  are  no  longer run if <b><a href="../man0/exit.0.html">exit</a></b>(0) is called within a "BEGIN",

</pre><h4><b>Obituary</b></h4><pre>
       Jeff Goff (JGOFF or DrForr), an integral part of the Perl and Raku communities and a dear friend  to  all
       of  us,  has passed away on March 13th, 2020. DrForr was a prominent member of the communities, attending
       and speaking at countless events, contributing to numerous projects, and assisting and helping in any way
       he could.

       His passing leaves a hole in our hearts and in our communities and he will be sorely missed.
