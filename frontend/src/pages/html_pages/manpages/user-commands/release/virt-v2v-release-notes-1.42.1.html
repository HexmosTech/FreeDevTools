       virt-v2v-release-notes - virt-v2v release notes for 1.42

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These are the release notes for <b>virt-v2v</b> <b>1.42</b>, released on <b>16th</b> <b>April</b> <b>2020</b>.

   <b>New</b> <b>features</b>
       This is the first release where virt-v2v lives in a separate repository from libguestfs.  The two
       projects are now broadly decoupled from one another.

       Add a new <u>-o</u> <u>json</u> output mode.  Primarily this is used to do conversions to KubeVirt (Pino Toscano).

       Use new libvirt "&lt;firmware&gt;" feature to get the source guest firmware (Pino Toscano).

       virt-v2v <u>-o</u> <u>rhv-upload</u> new option <u>-oo</u> <u>rhv-disk-uuid</u> allows disk UUIDs to be specified.  Also <u>-oo</u> <u>rhv-</u>
       <u>cafile</u> is now optional (Pino Toscano).

       Conversions over ssh now use <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-ssh-plugin.1.html">nbdkit-ssh-plugin</a></b>(1) instead of the QEMU ssh driver.  Similarly
       <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-curl-plugin.1.html">nbdkit-curl-plugin</a></b>(1) is used instead of the QEMU curl driver.  This allowed us to add more flexible
       features such as password authentication, bandwidth throttling (new <u>--bandwidth</u> option), readahead, and
       automatic retry on network failures.

       For Windows guests, QEMU Guest Agent MSI may now be installed (Tomáš Golembiovský).

   <b>Other</b> <b>fixes</b>
       In <u>-o</u> <u>libvirt</u> mode, support Windows Server 2019 (Pino Toscano).

       Fix Ubuntu Server conversions (Pino Toscano).

       Fix installation of qemu-ga by only installing arch-specific files in the guest (Pino Toscano).

       Delay installation of qemu-ga until after virtio-win drivers have been installed and rebooted (Tomáš
       Golembiovský).

       Save the log from running RHEV-APT installer to allow debugging (Tomáš Golembiovský).

       Check RHV cluster exists before trying to convert when using <u>-o</u> <u>rhv-upload</u> mode.  Also allows us to
       detect and reject various other conditions early.  (Pino Toscano).

       Label nbdkit sockets correctly for SELinux/sVirt (Martin Kletzander).

       You can use a block device as the Windows virtio driver ISO.

       Multiple fixes to RHV uploads: Set "DISKTYPE" field correctly when converting to RHV and VDSM.  Properly
       clean up on failure.  Display disk ID in error messages, and log script parameters, to help with
       debugging.  Multiple code cleanups.  (Nir Soffer).

       Support conversions to RHV in qcow2 format (Nir Soffer).

       Fix detection of disk status and failures after conversion to RHV (Daniel Erez).

       Cancel disk transfer and remove uploaded disks on failure of conversion to RHV (Pino Toscano).

       Images containing small holes (sparse regions) should now convert faster (Nir Soffer).

       The <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-cacheextents-filter.1.html">nbdkit-cacheextents-filter</a></b>(1) is used to accelerate sources which have slow sparseness detection,
       primarily this means VMware sources using VDDK (Martin Kletzander).

       Require at least 100 free inodes on each guest filesystem before doing conversion, since lack of inodes
       could cause conversion failures (Pino Toscano).

       Fix osinfo output for CentOS 8 conversions (Pino Toscano).

       VMware tools are now removed from Windows guests automatically in most cases (Pino Toscano).

       <u>-i</u> <u>ova</u> mode no longer reads the whole input OVF into memory, but parses it off disk (Pino Toscano).

       When converting to OpenStack, we now wait up to 5 minutes (instead of 60 seconds) for the Cinder volume
       to get attached to the conversion appliance, since in some cases it was taking a long time.

       If using a new enough version of nbdkit, virt-v2v logs should be much less verbose.

   <b>Security</b>
       There were no security-related bugs found in this release.

   <b>Build</b> <b>changes</b>
       Libguestfs ≥ 1.40 is required, it is now packaged and distributed separately from virt-v2v.  For
       developers you can use a locally built (and not installed) copy of libguestfs.

       Libvirt is now required to build virt-v2v.  Additionally you will require the OCaml bindings to libvirt
       (https://libvirt.org/ocaml/), although a copy is bundled for now (it will be removed later).  (Pino
       Toscano).

       Libosinfo is required to build virt-v2v.  It is used to query information about guest drivers.  (Pino
       Toscano).

       Fixes for OCaml ≥ 4.10.  The minimum version of OCaml required is still 4.01, but may be increased to
       4.05 in future.

       Test conversions of Debian 9 and Fedora 29 (Pino Toscano).

       Various fixes to srcdir != builddir (Pino Toscano).

       Remove gnulib modules not used by virt-v2v (Pino Toscano).

   <b>Internals</b>
       When converting SUSE guests, always try to install QXL driver (Mike Latimer).

       Two new modules (Nbdkit and Nbdkit_sources) factor out generic nbdkit operations and nbdkit source
       operations respectively.

       Format Python code to comply with PEP 8 / pycodestyle (Pino Toscano).

       Tests have been moved to the <u>tests/</u> subdirectory, and manuals to the <u>docs/</u> subdirectory.
