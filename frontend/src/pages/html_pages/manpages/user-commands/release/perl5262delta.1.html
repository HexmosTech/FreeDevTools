</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl5262delta - what is new for perl v5.26.2

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.26.1 release and the 5.26.2 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.26.0, first read perl5261delta, which describes
       differences between 5.26.0 and 5.26.1.

</pre><h4><b>Security</b></h4><pre>
   <b>[CVE-2018-6797]</b> <b>heap-buffer-overflow</b> <b>(WRITE</b> <b>of</b> <b>size</b> <b>1)</b> <b>in</b> <b>S_regatom</b> <b>(regcomp.c)</b>
       A crafted regular expression could cause a heap buffer write overflow, with control over the bytes
       written.  [GH #16185] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16185&gt;

   <b>[CVE-2018-6798]</b> <b>Heap-buffer-overflow</b> <b>in</b> <b>Perl__byte_dump_string</b> <b>(utf8.c)</b>
       Matching a crafted locale dependent regular expression could cause a heap buffer read overflow and
       potentially information disclosure.  [GH #16143] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16143&gt;

   <b>[CVE-2018-6913]</b> <b>heap-buffer-overflow</b> <b>in</b> <b>S_pack_rec</b>
       pack() could cause a heap buffer write overflow with a large item count.  [GH #16098]
       &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16098&gt;

   <b>Assertion</b> <b>failure</b> <b>in</b> <b>Perl__core_swash_init</b> <b>(utf8.c)</b>
       Control characters in a supposed Unicode property name could cause perl to crash.  This has been fixed.

</pre><h4><b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.26.1.  If any exist, they are bugs, and we request
       that you submit a report.  See "Reporting Bugs" below.

</pre><h4><b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Updated</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b>
       •   Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 5.20170922_26 to 5.20180414_26.

       •   PerlIO::via has been upgraded from version 0.16 to 0.17.

       •   Term::ReadLine has been upgraded from version 1.16 to 1.17.

       •   Unicode::UCD has been upgraded from version 0.68 to 0.69.

</pre><h4><b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Existing</b> <b>Documentation</b>
       <u>perluniprops</u>

       •   This   has   been   updated   to   note  that  "\p{Word}"  now  includes  code  points  matching  the
           "\p{Join_Control}" property.  The change to the property was made in Perl 5.18,  but  not  documented
           until  now.   There  are  currently only two code points that match this property: U+200C (ZERO WIDTH
           NON-JOINER) and U+200D (ZERO WIDTH JOINER).

</pre><h4><b>Platform</b> <b>Support</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Platform-Specific</b> <b>Notes</b>
       Windows
           Visual C++ compiler version detection has been improved to work on non-English language systems.  [GH
           #16235] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16235&gt;

           We now set $Config{libpth} correctly for 64-bit builds using Visual C++ versions earlier  than  14.1.
           [GH #16269] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16269&gt;

</pre><h4><b>Selected</b> <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b></h4><pre>
       •   The  readpipe()  built-in  function  now  checks  at  compile  time  that  it  has only one parameter
           expression, and puts it in scalar context, thus  ensuring  that  it  doesn't  corrupt  the  stack  at
           runtime.  [GH #2793] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/2793&gt;

       •   Fixed   a   use   after   free   bug   in   "pp_list"   introduced   in  Perl  5.27.1.   [GH  #16124]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16124&gt;

       •   Parsing a "sub" definition could cause a use  after  free  if  the  "sub"  keyword  was  followed  by
           whitespace         including        newlines        (and        comments).         [GH        #16097]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16097&gt;

       •   The tokenizer now correctly adjusts a parse pointer when skipping whitespace in an " ${identifier}  "
           construct.  [perl #131949] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131949&gt;

       •   Accesses  to  "${^LAST_FH}" no longer assert after using any of a variety of I/O operations on a non-
           glob.  [GH #15372] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15372&gt;

       •   "sort" now performs correct reference counting when aliasing  $a  and  $b,  thus  avoiding  premature
           destruction  and  leakage  of scalars if they are re-aliased during execution of the sort comparator.
           [GH #11422] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/11422&gt;

       •   Some convoluted kinds of regexp no longer cause an arithmetic overflow when  compiled.   [GH  #16113]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16113&gt;

       •   Fixed  a  duplicate  symbol  failure  with <b>-flto</b> <b>-mieee-fp</b> builds.  <u>pp.c</u> defined "_LIB_VERSION" which
           <b>-lieee</b> already defines.  [GH #16086] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16086&gt;

       •   A  NULL  pointer  dereference  in  the  S_regmatch()  function  has  been  fixed.    [perl   #132017]
           &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=132017&gt;

       •   Failures  while  compiling  code  within  other constructs, such as with string interpolation and the
           right part of "s///e" now cause compilation to abort earlier.

           Previously compilation could continue in order to report other errors, but the failed sub-parse could
           leave partly parsed constructs on the parser shift-reduce stack, confusing  the  parser,  leading  to
           perl crashes.  [GH #14739] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14739&gt;

</pre><h4><b>Acknowledgements</b></h4><pre>
       Perl 5.26.2 represents approximately 7 months of development since Perl 5.26.1 and contains approximately
       3,300 lines of changes across 82 files from 17 authors.

       Excluding  auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were approximately 1,800 lines of
       changes to 36 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

       Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users  and  developers.
       The following people are known to have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.26.2:

       Aaron Crane, Abigail, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, H.Merijn Brand, James E Keenan, Jarkko Hietaniemi, John SJ
       Anderson,  Karen Etheridge, Karl Williamson, Lukas Mai, Renee Baecker, Sawyer X, Steve Hay, Todd Rinaldo,
       Tony Cook, Yves Orton, Zefram.

       The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it  is  automatically  generated  from  version  control
       history.   In  particular,  it does not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN  modules  included  in  Perl's  core.
       We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for helping Perl to flourish.

       For  a  more  complete  list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see the <u>AUTHORS</u> file in the
       Perl source distribution.

</pre><h4><b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database  at  &lt;https://rt.perl.org/&gt;  .
       There may also be information at &lt;<a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a>&gt; , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with your release.  Be
       sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of
       "perl -V", will be sent off to <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a> to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

       If  the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly
       archived mailing list, then see "SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION" in perlsec  for  details  of
       how to report the issue.

</pre><h4><b>Give</b> <b>Thanks</b></h4><pre>
       If  you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5, you can do so by running the
       "perlthanks" program:

           perlthanks

       This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of thanks.
