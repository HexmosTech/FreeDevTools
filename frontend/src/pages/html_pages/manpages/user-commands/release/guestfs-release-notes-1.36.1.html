       guestfs-release-notes - libguestfs Release Notes

</pre><h4><b>RELEASE</b> <b>NOTES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>LIBGUESTFS</b> <b>1.36</b></h4><pre>
       These release notes only cover the differences from the previous stable/dev branch split (1.34.0).  For
       detailed changelogs, please see the git repository, or the ChangeLog file distributed in the tarball.

   <b>New</b> <b>features</b>
       <u>New</u> <u>tools</u>

       Virt-tail is a new tool for following (tailing) log files within a guest, similar to the regular "tail
       -f" command.

       <u>New</u> <u>features</u> <u>in</u> <u>existing</u> <u>tools</u>

       Virt-customize, virt-get-kernel, virt-sparsify and virt-sysprep can now handle encrypted guests (Pino
       Toscano).

       Virt-builder and virt-customize now support <u>--append-line</u>, which is useful for adding lines to the end of
       configuration files.

       Virt-resize can now shrink and expand swap partitions (Pino Toscano).

       Virt-resize can now output to non-local disks (Pino Toscano).

       Virt-sysprep has a new operation called "backup-files" for removing editor backups, and "passwd-backups"
       for removing <u><a href="file:/etc/passwd-">/etc/passwd-</a></u> and similar.

       Virt-dib can now create checksums using the new <u>--checksum</u> option (Pino Toscano).

       Virt-dib can now create tgz files.  In addition, extended attributes and SELinux labels are preserved in
       the output tar file (Pino Toscano).

       Virt-dib can now create squashfs files (Pino Toscano).

       Bash tab-completion is now available in every command line tool that is shipped.

       <u>virt-v2v</u> <u>and</u> <u>virt-p2v</u>

       Conversions of Debian (6+) and Ubuntu (10.04+) guests are now supported (Tomáš Golembiovský, Pino
       Toscano).

       Conversions from SUSE Xen hypervisor have now been tested (Cédric Bosdonnat).

       Windows conversions may now install a program "pnp_wait.exe" which prevents conflicts between the Windows
       Plug-and-Play Manager and our own scripts that install virtio device drivers.  Enabling this requires the
       "pnp_wait.exe" program to be built separately (Roman Kagan).

       OVA files exported from AWS can now be converted (Shahar Havivi).

       When converting OVA files, in some circumstances virt-v2v can now read disk images directly from the OVA
       input file instead of needing to unpack the OVA file to a temporary directory.  This can save large
       amounts of disk space, and is quicker (Tomáš Golembiovský).

       Virt-p2v can now be built on RHEL 5 (2007-era) Linux and RHEL 6, which means that 32 bit and hardware
       with ancient fakeraid disks can be virtualized.  Binaries of virt-p2v based on these old versions of RHEL
       can be found at <a href="http://oirase.annexia.org/virt-p2v/">http://oirase.annexia.org/virt-p2v/</a>

       Virt-p2v can now use nbdkit (an NBD server) as an alternative to qemu-nbd.  In addition, virt-p2v can use
       "socket activation" which is a more robust method for opening the NBD listening socket.  Socket
       activation works with qemu-nbd or nbdkit, but requires the most up to date versions.

       To prevent timeouts during P2V conversions, virt-p2v inhibits power saving on the physical machine, and
       also sends ping packets over the ssh control and data connections.

       Virt-v2v no longer removes the "Processor" and "Intelppm" nodes from the Windows Registry.

       Xen and vCenter conversions can now be done using the libvirt backend, provided libvirt ≥ 2.1.0 is used.

       <u>/dev/srX</u> (SCSI CD-ROM) devices are ignored (Tomáš Golembiovský).

       When converting SUSE Linux guests, use <u>/etc/modprobe.conf.local</u> if it exists.

       Removing VMware tools from Linux guests should now work reliably (Pino Toscano).

       When converting OVA files, virt-v2v now checks the disk image hash contained in the manifest file,
       whereas previously it was ignored because of a mistake in the code.  In addition, SHA256 hashes are now
       supported (Tomáš Golembiovský).

       When converting OVA files that contain compressed disk images, we now trust the "ovf:compression"
       attribute from the metadata instead of using content sniffing on the disk image (Tomáš Golembiovský).

       A new flag <u>--vdsm-compat</u> has been added to <u>-o</u> <u>vdsm</u> mode, allowing more efficient qcow2 images to be
       generated.

       Since the RHEV product [commercially supported version of oVirt] has now been renamed to RHV, "RHEV" was
       changed to "RHV" throughout the tooling.  In particular, <u>-o</u> <u>rhev</u> becomes <u>-o</u> <u>rhv</u>, although the old name
       can be used for backwards compatibility.

       The "RHEV-APT" utility is only installed when the output hypervisor is oVirt or RHV.

       A problem with virt-v2v running out of memory when doing an SELinux relabel of the guest filesystem
       should now be resolved.

       <u>Language</u> <u>bindings</u>

       Setting "EXTRA_JAVAC_FLAGS" before <u>./configure</u> allows you to add arbitrary flags to "javac" when
       compiling the Java bindings.

       Use of any libguestfs API which returned a single struct, from Perl or Java bindings, would have leaked
       memory.  This has now been fixed (Pino Toscano).

       <u>Inspection</u>

       Inspection of Windows guests with mildly corrupted Windows Registry hives should now work instead of
       failing with an error.  This feature requires hivex ≥ 1.3.14 (Dawid Zamirski).

       For Debian guests, we can now read the URL, source name, summary and full description of installed
       packages.  For RPM-based guests we can read the URL, summary and description (Pino Toscano).

       Inspection of guest operating systems that use a separate <u><a href="file:/usr">/usr</a></u> partition should now work more reliably
       (Pino Toscano).

       When parsing guest <u><a href="file:/etc/fstab">/etc/fstab</a></u>, paths are reduced to a canonical form (eg. "//<a href="file:/usr//local//">/usr//local//</a>" →
       "<a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a>").

       Inspection of btrfs subvolumes now works where the <u><a href="file:/etc/fstab">/etc/fstab</a></u> options field contains commas.

       <u>/dev/cdN</u> devices in guest <u><a href="file:/etc/fstab">/etc/fstab</a></u> are ignored (Pino Toscano).

       <u>Architectures</u> <u>and</u> <u>platforms</u>

       Stable releases are now tested on aarch64, ppc64 and ppc64le architectures.

       The RISC-V architecture is now handled as a guest, and libguestfs will now at least compile on RISC-V
       (but probably not work as there is no usable qemu at the time of writing).

       Detection of S/390 and S/390x binaries and guests is now supported.

       <u>Other</u>

       ExFAT filesystems are now supported (Miles Wolbe).

   <b>Security</b>
       See also <b><a href="../man1/guestfs-security.1.html">guestfs-security</a></b>(1).

       There were no CVEs reported in this development cycle.  However some security-related hardening was
       carried out as described below.

       Temporary filenames are now always generated using randomness from <u>/dev/urandom</u> (previously the C
       function <b><a href="../man3/random.3.html">random</a></b>(3) was used in one case).

       The $TERM environment variable is now validated before passing it through to the appliance kernel command
       line.

   <b>API</b>
       <u>New</u> <u>APIs</u>

       "guestfs_aug_transform"
           Exposes the Augeas "aug_transform" API (Pino Toscano).

       "guestfs_find_inode"
           Find files by inode number (Matteo Cafasso).

       "guestfs_inspect_get_windows_software_hive"
       "guestfs_inspect_get_windows_system_hive"
           Return the path to the Windows "HKLM\SYSTEM" and "HKLM\SOFTWARE" hives computed during inspection.

       "guestfs_mksquashfs"
           Create a squashfs filesystem from a path (Pino Toscano).

       <u>Other</u> <u>API</u> <u>changes</u>

       "guestfs_add_domain"
           This  call  now  handles libvirt file-based volumes correctly, where previously these would have been
           ignored.  Also handled are disks which require libvirt authentication secrets to open (Pino Toscano).

       "guestfs_canonical_device_name"
           This call will no longer incorrectly modify Linux software RAID device names (like <u>/dev/mdX</u>).

       "guestfs_file_architecture"
           Previously the "file_architecture" API could return either of the strings "i386" or "i486" for 32 bit
           x86 binaries.  It now only returns "i386" (as documented).

           This API can now return the following new values: "riscv32", "riscv64", "riscv128", "s390", "s390x".

       "guestfs_hivex_open"
           This now has an optional "GUESTFS_HIVEX_OPEN_UNSAFE" flag  which  allows  certain  corrupted  Windows
           Registry hives to be opened.  This feature requires hivex ≥ 1.3.14 (Dawid Zamirski).

       "guestfs_list_partitions"
           This call now returns Linux software RAID partitions.

       "guestfs_part_to_dev"
           This call now correctly handles partition names which include "p&lt;N&gt;" (Pino Toscano).

       "guestfs_set_label"
           This call can now change the labels of swap partitions (Pino Toscano).

   <b>Build</b> <b>changes</b>
       libmagic, the library part of the "file" command, is now required at build time (previously optional).

       GCC 7 is now supported.

       "Silent  rules"  are now used for OCaml programs, Java bindings.  To show the full command line executed,
       add "V=1" on the make command line (Pino Toscano).

       Slow testing ("make check-slow") now covers: firstboot scripts in  Linux  guests;  v2v  conversion  of  a
       selection   of   real   Linux   guests;  the  virt-customize  <u>--hostname</u>  and  <u>--timezone</u>  settings;  the
       <u>--root-password</u> parameter; that the serial console works in virt-builder guests.

       Large generated C source files, eg. the list of commands found in <u>fish/cmds.c</u> (and many more), have  been
       split into smaller files to speed parallel compilation.

       "make maintainer-check-extra-dist" now checks that all generated files are included in the tarball.

       The tests no longer assume that "." is in Perl's @INC, as it is going to be removed soon (Pino Toscano).

       Debian hosts using UsrMerge are now supported (Pino Toscano).

       Header files and C structs can now have internal documentation using the special "/** ... */" comments.

       "@VAR@"  subtitutions  in  ".<a href="file:/run">/run</a>"  are  now  fully  quoted.  This is necessary so that (eg) "./configure
       PYTHON=/some/path" works robustly if "/some/path" contains characters  that  need  to  be  quoted  (Hilko
       Bengen).

       gperf ≥ 3.1 is now supported.

       Kraxel's  old  edk2 builds can no longer be used for UEFI support.  UEFI code is now fully free software,
       so use the versions bundled with your Linux distro instead.

       Virt-p2v can now be compiled on RHEL 5 (2007-era) Linux with Gtk 2.10.

   <b>Internals</b>
       The generator and mllib "Common_utils" modules are now shared from the same source file.

       A considerable amount of common code has been moved into the <u>common</u> directory in the source  and  is  now
       compiled  only  once.   The  mini-libraries  located  under  here  are:  <u>common/edit</u>, <u>common/errnostring</u>,
       <u>common/miniexpect</u>,  <u>common/options</u>,  <u>common/parallel</u>,  <u>common/progress</u>,  <u>common/protocol</u>,   <u>common/utils</u>,
       <u>common/visit</u>, <u>common/windows</u>.

       The directory containing the main library code has moved from <u>src</u> → <u>lib</u>.

       All  tests  written in shell script now use a common file of utility functions (<u>tests/test-functions.sh</u>).
       There are several new utility functions, mainly for skipping tests.  Also these test scripts can now  use
       autoconf-like path variables like $abs_top_srcdir.

       UEFI paths are now stored in the generator (<u>generator/uefi.ml</u>).

       The  way  the  generator  handles  actions  and  procedure  numbers was changed quite substantially.  See
       <u>generator/actions_*.ml</u> and <u>generator/proc_nr.ml</u>.

       The gnulib "getprogname" module is now used everywhere  when  needing/printing  the  program  name  (Pino
       Toscano).

       <u>perl/Guestfs.c</u> is not translatable (Nikos Skalkotos).

       Virt-builder  templates moved from <u>builder/website</u> to <u>builder/templates</u> and there is now a single unified
       program which can build any template.

       All Windows registry utilities used by virt-customize and virt-v2v have been moved  to  a  common  module
       called "Registry" under <u>mllib</u>.

       All POSIX bindings have been moved to a new module called "Unix_utils" under <u>mllib</u>.

       Inspection,   virt-customize   and   virt-v2v   no   longer   recompute   the   Windows   "%systemroot%",
       "CurrentControlSet" or paths to the "HKLM\SYSTEM" and "HKLM\SOFTWARE" hives in multiple places.   Instead
       these  are  all  computed  once  (during  inspection)  and  passed  to  the  other  tools through various
       "guestfs_inspect_get_windows_*" APIs.

       "<a href="file:/dev/pts">/dev/pts</a>" is now available inside the appliance, so any tools we run which require a pty will  now  work
       (Pino Toscano).

       Most OCaml warnings have been fixed.

       There is now a single common function for creating temporary files ("guestfs_int_make_temp_path") (Matteo
       Cafasso).

       The $TERM environment variable is now validated before passing it through to the appliance kernel command
       line.

       Useless USB and memballoon devices are no longer created in the appliance (Laine Stump).

       On aarch64 we now use virtio-pci for the appliance.  This is somewhat faster than virtio-mmio.

       Use  of  <b><a href="../man3/srandom.3.html">srandom</a></b>(3)  and  <b><a href="../man3/random.3.html">random</a></b>(3) has been minimized.  In particular, temporary filenames are no longer
       created based on randomness returned by <b><a href="../man3/random.3.html">random</a></b>(3), but <u>/dev/urandom</u> is used instead.
