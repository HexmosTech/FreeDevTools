</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl5340delta - what is new for perl v5.34.0

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.32.0 release and the 5.34.0 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.30.0, first read perl5320delta, which describes
       differences between 5.30.0 and 5.32.0.

</pre><h4><b>Core</b> <b>Enhancements</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Experimental</b> <b>Try/Catch</b> <b>Syntax</b>
       An initial experimental attempt at providing "try"/"catch" notation has been added.

           use feature 'try';

           try {
               a_function();
           }
           catch ($e) {
               warn "An error occurred: $e";
           }

       For more information, see "Try Catch Exception Handling" in perlsyn.

   <b>"qr/{,n}/"</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>accepted</b>
       An empty lower bound is now accepted for regular expression quantifiers, like "m/x{,3}/" meaning
       "m/x{0,3}/"

   <b>Blanks</b> <b>freely</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>within</b> <b>but</b> <b>adjacent</b> <b>to</b> <b>curly</b> <b>braces</b>
       (in double-quotish contexts and regular expression patterns)

       This means you can write things like "\x{ FFFC }" if you like.  This applies to all such constructs,
       namely "\b{}", "\g{}", "\k{}", "\N{}", "\o{}", and "\x{}"; as well as the regular expression quantifier
       "{<u>m</u>,<u>n</u>}".  "\p{}" and "\P{}" retain their already-existing, even looser, rules mandated by the Unicode
       standard (see "Properties accessible through \p{} and \P{}" in perluniprops).

       This ability is in effect regardless of the presence of the "/x" regular expression pattern modifier.

       Additionally, the comma in a regular expression braced quantifier may have blanks (tabs or spaces) before
       and/or after the comma, like "qr/a{ 5, 7 }/".

   <b>New</b> <b>octal</b> <b>syntax</b> <b>"0o</b><u><b>ddddd</b></u><b>"</b>
       It is now possible to specify octal literals with "0o" prefixes, as in "0o123_456", parallel to the
       existing construct to specify hexadecimal literal "0x<u>ddddd</u>" and binary literal "0b<u>ddddd</u>".  Also, the
       builtin oct() function now accepts this new syntax.

       See "Scalar value constructors" in perldata and "oct EXPR" in perlfunc.

</pre><h4><b>Diagnostics</b></h4><pre>
       The following additions or changes have been made to diagnostic  output,  including  warnings  and  fatal
       error messages.  For the complete list of diagnostic messages, see perldiag.

   <b>New</b> <b>Diagnostics</b>
       <u>New</u> <u>Errors</u>

       •   Bareword filehandle "%s" not allowed under 'no feature "bareword_filehandles"'

           This accompanies the new bareword_filehandles feature.

       •   Multidimensional hash lookup is disabled

           This accompanies the new multidimensional feature.

       <u>New</u> <u>Warnings</u>

       •   Wide character in setenv key (encoding to utf8)

           Attempts to put wide characters into environment variable keys via %ENV now provoke this warning.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Existing</b> <b>Diagnostics</b>
       •   Error %s in expansion of %s

           An  error was encountered in handling a user-defined property ("User-Defined Character Properties" in
           perlunicode).  These are programmer written subroutines, hence subject to  errors  that  may  prevent
           them from compiling or running.

       •   Infinite recursion in user-defined property

           A  user-defined  property  ("User-Defined  Character  Properties"  in  perlunicode) can depend on the
           definitions of other user-defined properties.  If the  chain  of  dependencies  leads  back  to  this
           property, infinite recursion would occur, were it not for the check that raised this error.

       •   Timeout waiting for another thread to define \p{%s}

           The  first time a user-defined property ("User-Defined Character Properties" in perlunicode) is used,
           its definition is looked up and converted into an  internal  form  for  more  efficient  handling  in
           subsequent  uses.   There  could  be a race if two or more threads tried to do this processing nearly
           simultaneously.

       •   Unknown user-defined property name \p{%s}

           You specified to use a property within the "\p{...}" which was  a  syntactically  valid  user-defined
           property, but no definition was found for it

       •   Too few arguments for subroutine '%s' (got %d; expected %d)

           Subroutine argument-count mismatch errors now include the number of given and expected arguments.

       •   Too many arguments for subroutine '%s' (got %d; expected %d)

           Subroutine argument-count mismatch errors now include the number of given and expected arguments.

       •   Lost precision when %s %f by 1

           This  warning  was only issued for positive too-large values when incrementing, and only for negative
           ones when decrementing.  It is now issued for both positive or negative too-large values.  [GH #18333
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18333&gt;]

       •   \K not permitted in lookahead/lookbehind in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/

           This error was incorrectly produced in some cases involving nested lookarounds.  This has been fixed.
           [GH #18123 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18123&gt;]

       •   Use of uninitialized value%s

           This warning may now include the array or hash index when the uninitialized value is the result of an
           element not found.  This will only happen if the index is a simple non-magical variable.

</pre><h4><b>Utility</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
   <b>perl5db.pl</b> <b>(the</b> <b>debugger)</b>
       •   New option: "HistItemMinLength"

           This option controls the minimum length a command must be to get stored in  history.   Traditionally,
           this  has  been  fixed  at  2.   Changes  to  the debugger are often perilous, and new bugs should be
           reported so the debugger can be debugged.

       •   Fix to "i" and "l" commands

           The "i $var" and "l $var" commands work again with lexical variables.

</pre><h4><b>Configuration</b> <b>and</b> <b>Compilation</b></h4><pre>
       •   Prevented incpath to spill into libpth

       •   Use realpath if available. (This might catch more duplicate paths.)

       •   Only include real existing paths.

       •   Filter inc paths out of libpth.

       •   stadtx hash support has been removed

           stadtx  support  has   been   entirely   removed.    Previously,   it   could   be   requested   with
           "PERL_HASH_FUNC_STADTX",  and  was  default  in  64-bit  builds.   It has been replaced with SipHash.
           SipHash has been more rigorously reviewed than stadtx.

       •   Configure

           A new probe checks for buggy libc  implementations  of  the  "gcvt"/"qgcvt"  functions.   [GH  #18170
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18170&gt;]

       •   "-Dusedefaultstrict"

           Perl can now be built with strict on by default (using the configuration option "-Dusedefaultstrict".

           These strict defaults do not apply when "perl" is run via "-e" or "-E".

           This  setting  provides  a  diagnostic  mechanism  intended for development purposes only and is thus
           undefined by default.

       •   The minimum supported Bison version is now 2.4, and the maximum is 3.7.

       •   Newer 64-bit versions of the Intel C/C++ compiler are now recognised and have the correct flags set.

       •   We now trap SIGBUS when <u>Configure</u> checks for "va_copy".

           On several systems the attempt to determine if we need "va_copy"  or  similar  results  in  a  SIGBUS
           instead of the expected SIGSEGV, which previously caused a core dump.

</pre><h4><b>Testing</b></h4><pre>
       Tests  were  added  and changed to reflect the other additions and changes in this release.  Furthermore,
       these significant changes were made:

       •   Split Config-dependent tests in <u>t/opbasic/arith.t</u> to <u>t/op/arith2.t</u>

       •   <u>t/re/opt.t</u>  was  added,  providing  a   test   harness   for   regexp   optimization.    [GH   #18213
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/18213&gt;]

       •   A   workaround   for   CPAN   distributions   needing  dot  in  @INC  has  been  removed  [GH  #18394
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/18394&gt;].   All  distributions  that   previously   required   the
           workaround have now been adapted.

       •   When  testing in parallel on many-core platforms, you can now cause the test suite to finish somewhat
           earlier, but with less logical ordering of the tests, by setting

            PERL_TEST_HARNESS_ASAP=1

           while running the test suite.

</pre><h4><b>Platform</b> <b>Support</b></h4><pre>
   <b>New</b> <b>Platforms</b>
       9front
           Allow building Perl on i386 9front systems (a fork of plan9).

   <b>Updated</b> <b>Platforms</b>
       Plan9
           Improve support for Plan9 on i386 platforms.

       MacOS (Darwin)
           The hints file for darwin has been updated to handle future MacOS  versions  beyond  10.  [GH  #17946
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17946&gt;]

   <b>Discontinued</b> <b>Platforms</b>
       Symbian
           Support  code  relating  to  Symbian  has  been  removed.  Symbian was an operating system for mobile
           devices.  The port was last updated in July 2009, and the platform itself in October 2012.

   <b>Platform-Specific</b> <b>Notes</b>
       DragonFlyBSD
           Tests    were    updated    to    workaround     DragonFlyBSD     bugs     in     tc*()     functions
           &lt;https://bugs.dragonflybsd.org/issues/3252&gt;               and              ctime              updates
           &lt;https://bugs.dragonflybsd.org/issues/3251&gt;.

       Mac OS X
           A number of system libraries no longer exist as actual files on Big Sur, even  though  "dlopen"  will
           pretend  they  do,  so  now  we fall back to "dlopen" if a library file can not be found.  [GH #18407
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18407&gt;]

       Windows
           Reading non-ASCII characters from the console when its codepage was set to 65001 (UTF-8)  was  broken
           due  to  a  bug  in  Windows.  A  workaround  for  this  problem  has  been  implemented.  [GH #18701
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18701&gt;]

           Building with mingw.org compilers (version 3.4.5 or later) using mingw runtime versions  &lt;  3.22  now
           works again.  This was broken in Perl 5.31.4.

           Building  with  mingw.org compilers (version 3.4.5 or later) using mingw runtime versions &gt;= 3.21 now
           works (for compilers up to version 5.3.0).

           <u>Makefile.mk</u>, and thus support for dmake, has been removed. It is still  possible  to  build  Perl  on
           Windows     using     nmake     (Makefile)     and    GNU    make    (GNUmakefile).     [GH    #18511
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/18511&gt;]

           perl can now be built with "USE_QUADMATH" on MS Windows using (32-bit and 64-bit) mingw-w64 ports  of
           gcc.  [GH #18465 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/18465&gt;]

           The  <u>pl2bat.pl</u>  utility  now  needs  to "use ExtUtils::PL2Bat". This could cause failures in parallel
           builds.

           Windows now supports <b>symlink()</b> and <b>readlink()</b>, and <b>lstat()</b> is no longer an  alias  for  <b>stat()</b>.   [GH
           #18005 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18005&gt;].

           Unlike  POSIX  systems,  creating  a  symbolic link on Windows requires either elevated privileges or
           Windows 10 1703 or later with Developer Mode enabled.

           <b>stat()</b>, including "stat FILEHANDLE", and <b>lstat()</b> now uses our own implementation that  populates  the
           device "dev" and inode numbers "ino" returned rather than always returning zero.  The number of links
           "nlink" field is now always populated.

           "${^WIN32_SLOPPY_STAT}"   previously  controlled  whether the "nlink" field was populated requiring a
           separate Windows API call to fetch, since "nlink" and the other information required  for  stat()  is
           now retrieved in a single API call.

           The  "-r"  and  "-w"  operators  now  return  true  for  the  "STDIN", "STDOUT" and "STDERR" handles.
           Unfortunately  it  still  won't  return  true  for  duplicates   of   those   handles.    [GH   #8502
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/8502&gt;].

           The  times  returned  by  <b>stat()</b>  and  <b>lstat()</b>  are  no longer incorrect across Daylight Savings Time
           adjustments.  [GH #6080 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/6080&gt;].

           "-x" on a filehandle should now match "-x" on the corresponding filename  on  Vista  or  later.   [GH
           #4145 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/4145&gt;].

           "-e       '"'"       no       longer       incorrectly       returns      true.       [GH      #12431
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/12431&gt;].

           The same manifest is now used for Visual C++ and gcc builds.

           Previously,  MSVC  builds  were   using   the   <b>/manifestdependency</b>   flag   instead   of   embedding
           <u>perlexe.manifest</u>,  which  caused  issues such as GetVersionEx() returning the wrong version number on
           Windows 10.

       z/OS
           The locale categories "LC_SYNTAX" and "LC_TOD" are now recognized.  Perl  doesn't  do  anything  with
           these, except it now allows you to specify them.  They are included in "LC_ALL".

</pre><h4><b>Internal</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       •   Corrected handling of double and long double parameters for perl's implementation of formatted output
           for "-Dusequadmath" builds.

           This applies to PerlIO_printf(), croak(), warn(), sv_catpvf() and their variants.

           Previously in "quadmath" builds, code like:

             PerlIO_printf(PerlIO_stderr(), "%g", somedouble);

           or

             PerlIO_printf(PerlIO_stderr(), "%Lg", somelongdouble);

           would  erroneously  throw an exception "panic: quadmath invalid format ...", since the code added for
           quadmath builds assumed "NV"s were the only floating point format passed into these functions.

           This code would also process the standard C long double specifier "L"  as  if  it  expected  an  "NV"
           ("__float128" for quadmath builds), resulting in undefined behaviour.

           These functions now correctly accept doubles, long doubles and NVs.

       •   Previously the right operand of bitwise shift operators (shift amount) was implicitly cast from IV to
           int, but it might lead wrong results if IV does not fit in int.

           And  also,  shifting INT_MIN bits used to yield the shiftee unchanged (treated as 0-bit shift instead
           of negative shift).

       •   A set of  "cop_hints_exists_{pv,pvn,pvs,sv}"  functions  was  added,  to  support  checking  for  the
           existence of keys in the hints hash of a specific cop without needing to create a mortal copy of said
           value.

       •   An  aid  has  been  added  for  using the "DEBUG" macros when debugging XS or C code. The comments in
           <u>perl.h</u> describe "DEBUG_PRE_STMTS" and "DEBUG_POST_STMTS". which you can "#define" to do  things  like
           save  and  restore  "errno",  in  case  the  "DEBUG"  calls  are interfering with that, or to display
           timestamps, or which thread it's coming from, or the location of the call, or whatever.  You can make
           a quick hack to help you track something down without having to edit individual "DEBUG" calls.

       •   Make "REFCOUNTED_HE_EXISTS" available outside of core

       •   All "SvTRUE"-ish functions now evaluate their arguments exactly once.  In 5.32, plain  ""SvTRUE""  in
           perlapi was changed to do that; now the rest do as well.

       •   Unicode  is now a first class citizen when considering the pattern /A*B/ where A and B are arbitrary.
           The pattern matching code tries to make a tight loop to match the span of A's.  The logic of this was
           now really updated with support for UTF-8.

       •   The re module has a new function "optimization", which can return  a  hashref  of  optimization  data
           discovered about a compiled regexp.

       •   The  "PERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT"  compilation  option  has  been removed, and with it the need or the "dVAR"
           macro.  "dVAR" remains defined as a no-op outside "PERL_CORE"  for  backwards  compatiblity  with  XS
           modules.

       •   A  new  savestack  type  "SAVEt_HINTS_HH"  has  been  added,  which neatens the previous behaviour of
           "SAVEt_HINTS".  On previous versions the types and values pushed to the save stack  would  depend  on
           whether  the hints included the "HINT_LOCALIZE_HH" bit, which complicates external code that inspects
           the save stack. The new version uses a different savestack type to indicate the difference.

       •   A new API function "av_count" in perlapi has been added which gives a clearly named way to  find  how
           many elements are in an array.

</pre><h4><b>Selected</b> <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b></h4><pre>
       •   Setting %ENV now properly handles upgraded strings in the key. Previously Perl sent the SV's internal
           PV  directly  to  the  OS;  now  it  will handle keys as it has handled values since 5.18: attempt to
           downgrade the string first; if that fails then warn and use the utf8 form.

       •   Fix a memory leak in regcomp.c [GH #18604 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18604&gt;]

       •   pack/unpack format 'D' now works on all systems that could support it

           Previously if "NV == long double", now it is supported on all platforms that have  long  doubles.  In
           particular that means it is now also supported on quadmath platforms.

       •   Skip     trying     to     constant     fold     an     incomplete     op     tree     [GH     #18380
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18380&gt;]

           Constant folding of chained comparison op trees could fail under certain conditions, causing perl  to
           crash.  As  a  quick  fix, constant folding is now skipped for such op trees. This also addresses [GH
           #17917 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17917&gt;].

       •   %g     formatting     broken     on     Ubuntu-18.04,     "NVSIZE     ==      8"      [GH      #18170
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18170&gt;]

           Buggy  libc  implementations  of  the  "gcvt" and "qgcvt" functions caused "(s)printf" to incorrectly
           truncate %g formatted numbers.  A new Configure probe now checks for this, with the result  that  the
           libc "sprintf" will be used in place of "gcvt" and "qgcvt".

           Tests  added as part of this fix also revealed related problems in some Windows builds. The makefiles
           for MINGW builds on Windows have  thus  been  adjusted  to  use  "USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO"  by  default,
           ensuring that they also provide correct "(s)printf" formatting of numbers.

       •   <u>op.c</u>:     croak     on     "my    $_"    when    "use    utf8"    is    in    effect    [GH    #18449
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18449&gt;]

           The lexical topic feature experiment was removed in Perl v5.24 and declaring "my $_" became a compile
           time error. However, it was previously still possible to make this declaration if "use utf8"  was  in
           effect.

       •   <u>regexec.c</u>: Fix assertion failure [GH #18451 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18451&gt;]

           Fuzzing triggered an assertion failure in the regexp engine when too many characters were copied into
           a buffer.

       •   <b>semctl()</b>,  <b>msgctl()</b>,  and  <b>shmctl()</b>  now properly reset the UTF-8 flag on the "ARG" parameter if it's
           modified for "IPC_STAT" or "GETALL" operations.

       •   semctl(), msgctl(), and shmctl() now attempt to downgrade the "ARG" parameter if its value  is  being
           used as input to "IPC_SET" or "SETALL" calls.  A failed downgrade will thrown an exception.

       •   In  cases  where  semctl(),  msgctl()  or  shmctl()  would treat the "ARG" parameter as a pointer, an
           undefined value no longer generates a warning.  In most such calls the pointer isn't used anyway  and
           this allows you to supply "undef" for a value not used by the underlying function.

       •   <b>semop()</b>  now  downgrades  the  "OPSTRING"  parameter, <b>msgsnd()</b> now downgrades the "MSG" parameter and
           shmwrite now downgrades the "STRING" parameter to treat them as bytes.  Previously they would be left
           upgraded, providing a corrupted structure to the underlying function call.

       •   <b>msgrcv()</b> now properly resets the UTF-8 flag the "VAR" parameter when it is modified.  Previously  the
           UTF-8 flag could be left on, resulting in a possibly corrupt result in "VAR".

       •   Magic    is    now    called    correctly    for   stacked   file   test   operators.    [GH   #18293
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18293&gt;]

       •   The "@ary = split(...)" optimization no longer switches in the target array as the value stack.   [GH
           #18232       &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18232&gt;]      Also      see      discussion      at
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/18014#issuecomment-671299506&gt;.

       •   Fixed a bug in which some regexps with recursive subpatterns matched incorrectly.

           [GH #18096 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18096&gt;]

       •   On  Win32,  "waitpid(-1,  WNOHANG)"  could  sometimes  have  a  very  large  timeout.    [GH   #16529
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16529&gt;]

       •   "MARK" and hence "items" are now correctly initialized in "BOOT" XSUBs.

       •   Some  list  assignments  involving  "undef"  on  the  left-hand side were over-optimized and produced
           incorrect   results.    [GH   #16685   &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16685&gt;],   [GH    #17816

       Perl   5.34.0  represents  approximately  11  months  of  development  since  Perl  5.32.0  and  contains
       approximately 280,000 lines of changes across 2,100 files from 78 authors.

       Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were approximately  150,000  lines
