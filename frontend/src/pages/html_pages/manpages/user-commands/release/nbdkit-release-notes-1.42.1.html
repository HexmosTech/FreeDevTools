</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       nbdkit-release-notes-1.42 - release notes for nbdkit 1.42

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These are the release notes for nbdkit stable release 1.42.  This describes the major changes since 1.40.

       nbdkit 1.42.0 was released on <b>11</b> <b>February</b> <b>2025</b>.

   <b>Security</b>
       <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-ip-filter.1.html">nbdkit-ip-filter</a></b>(1) has been fixed to close an information leak.  In an unusual configuration of the
       filter, it could leak the list of exports to clients that are supposed to be blocked.

       All past security issues and information about how to report new ones can be found in <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-security.1.html">nbdkit-security</a></b>(1).

   <b>Plugins</b>
       <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-ondemand-plugin.1.html">nbdkit-ondemand-plugin</a></b>(1) now allows more characters to appear in filenames.  Colons are now allowed, so
       filenames containing MAC addresses can be used, which is useful when using NBD in pre-boot environments.
       Also add the "share=true" option to allow sharing.  (Thanks Markus Hartung)

       <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-vddk-plugin.1.html">nbdkit-vddk-plugin</a></b>(1) now prints the default list of transports in <u>--dump-plugin</u> output.  Also this
       plugin now handles partial chunks correctly when reading extents for disks with a non-aligned size
       (thanks Ming Xie).

   <b>Filters</b>
       New <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-time-limit-filter.1.html">nbdkit-time-limit-filter</a></b>(1) can be used to specify the maximum time limit for a connection.  (See
       also the new <u>--timeout</u> option below).

       New <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-lzip-filter.1.html">nbdkit-lzip-filter</a></b>(1) implements random access to lzip-compressed files (Jan Felix Langenbach).

   <b>Language</b> <b>bindings</b>
       Multiple updates to <b><a href="../man3/nbdkit-rust-plugin.3.html">nbdkit-rust-plugin</a></b>(3) to keep up to date with latest changes in the Rust language
       (Alan Somers).

       Fix crash that happened in <b><a href="../man3/nbdkit-ocaml-plugin.3.html">nbdkit-ocaml-plugin</a></b>(3) plugins with OCaml ≥ 5 (thanks Guillaume Munch-
       Maccagnoni, Gabriel Scherer).  Also update the ocamldoc documentation.  Fix more OCaml 5 deprecation
       warnings.

       Add support for Tcl 9.0 to <b><a href="../man3/nbdkit-tcl-plugin.3.html">nbdkit-tcl-plugin</a></b>(3).

   <b>Server</b>
       nbdkit will now try to send the last plugin error message over the NBD protocol to the client, to provide
       additional information.  This requires an NBD client which supports this, such as qemu ≥ 2.12 or
       libnbd ≥ 1.22.

       New nbdkit <u>--timeout</u> flag can be used as a security measure to ensure that clients don't consume
       resources by opening lots of connections and then not negotiating (or negotiating slowly) the full NBD
       session.

       New nbdkit <u>--keepalive</u> option which enables TCP-level keepalives.  This is useful for detecting dead
       clients.

       nbdkit <u>--dump-config</u> output now includes "timeout_option=yes|no" and "vsock_option=yes|no" reflecting
       whether the <u>--timeout</u> and <u>--vsock</u> options are available.

   <b>Bug</b> <b>fixes</b>
       Detect and warn about certain conditions which can cause the closed-source VDDK library to crash the
       server (Matthew Arnold, Nijin Ashok, Eric Blake).

   <b>Tests</b>
       Plugins from nbdkit 1.38 have been added to the <u>tests/old-plugins</u> directory.

   <b>Build</b>
       nbdkit should be buildable again on macOS.

       Add support for GCC 15.
