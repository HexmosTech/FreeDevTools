       libnbd-release-notes-1.14 - release notes for libnbd 1.14

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These are the release notes for libnbd stable release 1.14.  This describes the major changes since 1.12.

       libnbd 1.14.0 was released on <b>1</b> <b>August</b> <b>2022</b>.

   <b>Security</b>
       No security issues were found in this release.

       If you find a security issue, please read <u>SECURITY</u> in the source (online here:
       https://gitlab.com/nbdkit/libnbd/blob/master/SECURITY).  To find out about previous security issues in
       libnbd, see <b><a href="../man3/libnbd-security.3.html">libnbd-security</a></b>(3).

   <b>New</b> <b>APIs</b>
       No new APIs were added in this release.

   <b>Enhancements</b> <b>to</b> <b>existing</b> <b>APIs</b>
       Optimizations to <b><a href="../man3/nbd_pread_structured.3.html">nbd_pread_structured</a></b>(3) (Eric Blake).

       Many performance enhancements in the Python bindings: "nbd.pread" now avoids an extra memory allocation
       and copy.  Buffers can now be passed to "nbd.Buffer.from_bytearray".  New methods
       "nbd.Buffer.{to,from}_buffer" allow control over copying and sharing "nbd.Buffer".  Any buffer-like
       object can be used in "nbd.aio_{pread,pwrite}".  "len(nbd.Buffer(n))" now works.  Improve error messages
       when the wrong types are passed to several APIs.  Fix usage of "PyGILState".  (Eric Blake)

       Golang "AioBuffer" now calls panic on invalid usage (Nir Soffer).

       In golang tests, use "GOTRACEBACK=crash" so we get full core dumps on failures.

       kTLS should now work (transparently) when available in the kernel and GnuTLS.  Use of kTLS will be
       indicated in debug output.  (Daiki Ueno, František Krenželok)

   <b>Tools</b>
       New <b><a href="../man1/nbddump.1.html">nbddump</a></b>(1) tool which can efficiently hexdump the contents of an NBD server.

       <b><a href="../man1/nbdcopy.1.html">nbdcopy</a></b>(1) now obeys the NBD server minimum/preferred block size when copying, which should make it more
       efficient and avoids issues with some qemu-nbd configurations where the minimum block size must be obeyed
       for correct operation.

   <b>Tests</b>
       New tests for "nbd+vsock://" URI support.

   <b>Other</b> <b>improvements</b> <b>and</b> <b>bug</b> <b>fixes</b>
       Fixed rare TLS deadlock when reading from slow servers, and support for clean shutdown when connecting to
       qemu-nbd over TLS (thanks Michael Ablassmeier).

       The library now uses the GnuTLS flag "GNUTLS_NO_SIGNAL" (if available) which ensures that TLS connections
       should not cause the main program to exit with "SIGPIPE" in certain cases of server failure.  (Libnbd has
       long used "MSG_NOSIGNAL" on non-TLS connections which has a similar effect.)

       Various enhancements to fuzzing were made, including support for AFL++ clang-LTO mode, ASAN, allowing
       seed test cases to be captured, and extended testing of APIs.

       Tests were fixed so they should pass on RHEL 7 and FreeBSD.

   <b>Documentation</b>
       No changes in this release.

   <b>Build</b>
       "ARRAY_SIZE" macro added to simplify static array sizing (thanks Laszlo Ersek).

       Various errors found by Coverity were fixed.
