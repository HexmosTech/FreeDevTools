</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl5224delta - what is new for perl v5.22.4

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.22.3 release and the 5.22.4 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.22.2, first read perl5223delta, which describes
       differences between 5.22.2 and 5.22.3.

</pre><h4><b>Security</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Improved</b> <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>'.'</b> <b>in</b> <b>@INC</b> <b>in</b> <b>base.pm</b>
       The handling of (the removal of) '.' in @INC in base has been improved.  This resolves some problematic
       behaviour in the approach taken in Perl 5.22.3, which is probably best described in the following two
       threads on the Perl 5 Porters mailing list:
       &lt;<a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2016/08/msg238991.html">http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2016/08/msg238991.html</a>&gt;,
       &lt;<a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2016/10/msg240297.html">http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2016/10/msg240297.html</a>&gt;.

   <b>"Escaped"</b> <b>colons</b> <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> <b>paths</b> <b>in</b> <b>PATH</b>
       On Unix systems, Perl treats any relative paths in the PATH environment variable as tainted when starting
       a new process.  Previously, it was allowing a backslash to escape a colon (unlike the OS), consequently
       allowing relative paths to be considered safe if the PATH was set to something like "/\:.".  The check
       has been fixed to treat "." as tainted in that example.

</pre><h4><b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Updated</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b>
       •   base has been upgraded from version 2.22 to 2.22_01.

       •   Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 5.20170114_22 to 5.20170715_22.

</pre><h4><b>Selected</b> <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b></h4><pre>
       •   Fixed  a  crash  with "s///l" where it thought it was dealing with UTF-8 when it wasn't.  [GH #15543]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15543&gt;

</pre><h4><b>Acknowledgements</b></h4><pre>
       Perl 5.22.4 represents approximately 6 months of development since Perl 5.22.3 and contains approximately
       2,200 lines of changes across 52 files from 16 authors.

       Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were approximately  970  lines  of
       changes to 18 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

       Perl  continues  to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and developers.
       The following people are known to have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.22.4:

       Aaron Crane, Abigail, Aristotle Pagaltzis, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, David Mitchell, Eric  Herman,  Father
       Chrysostomos, James E Keenan, Karl Williamson, Lukas Mai, Renee Baecker, Ricardo Signes, Sawyer X, Stevan
       Little, Steve Hay, Tony Cook.

       The  list  above  is  almost  certainly  incomplete as it is automatically generated from version control
       history.  In particular, it does not include the names of the (very much  appreciated)  contributors  who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many  of  the  changes  included  in this version originated in the CPAN modules included in Perl's core.
       We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for helping Perl to flourish.

       For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see the  <u>AUTHORS</u>  file  in  the
       Perl source distribution.

</pre><h4><b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  find  what  you  think  is  a  bug,  you  might  check  the  articles  recently  posted  to  the
       comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at https://rt.perl.org/  .   There  may  also  be
       information at <a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a> , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with your release.  Be
       sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of
       "perl -V", will be sent off to <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a> to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly
       archived  mailing  list,  then please send it to <a href="mailto:perl5-security-report@perl.org">perl5-security-report@perl.org</a>.  This points to a closed
       subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be  able  to  help
       assess  the  impact  of  issues,  figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to
       mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which  Perl  is  supported.   Please  only  use  this
       address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
