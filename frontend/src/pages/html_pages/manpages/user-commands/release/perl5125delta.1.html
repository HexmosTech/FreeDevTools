</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl5125delta - what is new for perl v5.12.5

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.12.4 release and the 5.12.5 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.12.3, first read perl5124delta, which describes
       differences between 5.12.3 and 5.12.4.

</pre><h4><b>Security</b></h4><pre>
   <b>"Encode"</b> <b>decode_xs</b> <b>n-byte</b> <b>heap-overflow</b> <b>(CVE-2011-2939)</b>
       A bug in "Encode" could, on certain inputs, cause the heap to overflow.  This problem has been corrected.
       Bug reported by Robert Zacek.

   <b>File::Glob::bsd_glob()</b> <b>memory</b> <b>error</b> <b>with</b> <b>GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC</b> <b>(CVE-2011-2728)</b>
       Calling "File::Glob::bsd_glob" with the unsupported flag GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC would cause an access violation
       / segfault.  A Perl program that accepts a flags value from an external source could expose itself to
       denial of service or arbitrary code execution attacks.  There are no known exploits in the wild.  The
       problem has been corrected by explicitly disabling all unsupported flags and setting unused function
       pointers to null.  Bug reported by Clément Lecigne.

   <b>Heap</b> <b>buffer</b> <b>overrun</b> <b>in</b> <b>'x'</b> <b>string</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>operator</b> <b>(CVE-2012-5195)</b>
       Poorly written perl code that allows an attacker to specify the count to perl's 'x' string repeat
       operator can already cause a memory exhaustion denial-of-service attack. A flaw in versions of perl
       before 5.15.5 can escalate that into a heap buffer overrun; coupled with versions of glibc before 2.16,
       it possibly allows the execution of arbitrary code.

       This problem has been fixed.

</pre><h4><b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.12.4. If any exist, they are bugs and reports are
       welcome.

</pre><h4><b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Updated</b> <b>Modules</b>
       <u>B::Concise</u>

       B::Concise no longer produces mangled output with the <b>-tree</b> option [perl #80632].

       <u>charnames</u>

       A regression introduced in Perl 5.8.8 has been fixed, that caused charnames::<a href="../man0/viacode.0.html">viacode</a>(0) to return "undef"
       instead of the string "NULL" [perl #72624].

       <u>Encode</u> <u>has</u> <u>been</u> <u>upgraded</u> <u>from</u> <u>version</u> <u>2.39</u> <u>to</u> <u>version</u> <u>2.39_01</u>

       See "Security".

       <u>File::Glob</u> <u>has</u> <u>been</u> <u>upgraded</u> <u>from</u> <u>version</u> <u>1.07</u> <u>to</u> <u>version</u> <u>1.07_01</u>

       See "Security".

       <u>Unicode::UCD</u>

       The documentation for the "upper" function now actually says "upper", not "lower".

       <u>Module::CoreList</u>

       Module::CoreList has been updated to version 2.50_02 to add data for this release.

</pre><h4><b>Changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Existing</b> <b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>perlebcdic</b>
       The perlebcdic document contains a helpful table to use in "tr///" to convert between EBCDIC and
       Latin1/ASCII.  Unfortunately, the table was the inverse of the one it describes.  This has been
       corrected.

   <b>perlunicode</b>
       The section on User-Defined Case Mappings had some bad markup and unclear sentences, making parts of it
       unreadable.  This has been rectified.

   <b>perluniprops</b>
       This document has been corrected to take non-ASCII platforms into account.

</pre><h4><b>Installation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Configuration</b> <b>Improvements</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Platform</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Changes</b>
       Mac OS X
           There have been configuration and test fixes to make Perl build cleanly on Lion and Mountain Lion.

       NetBSD
           The NetBSD hints file was corrected to be compatible with NetBSD 6.*

</pre><h4><b>Selected</b> <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b></h4><pre>
       •   "chop" now correctly handles characters above "\x{7fffffff}" [perl #73246].

       •   "($&lt;,$&gt;)  =  (...)"  stopped  working properly in 5.12.0.  It is supposed to make a single setreuid()
           call, rather than calling setruid() and seteuid() separately.  Consequently it did not work properly.
           This has been fixed [perl #75212].

       •   Fixed a regression of <b>kill()</b> when a match variable is used for the process ID to kill [perl #75812].

       •   "UNIVERSAL::VERSION" no longer leaks memory.  It started leaking in Perl 5.10.0.

       •   The  C-level  "my_strftime"  functions  no  longer  leaks  memory.   This  fixes  a  memory  leak  in
           "POSIX::strftime" [perl #73520].

       •   "caller"  no  longer  leaks memory when called from the DB package if @DB::args was assigned to after
           the first call to "caller".  Carp was triggering this bug [perl #97010].

       •   Passing to "index" an offset beyond the end of the string when the string is  encoded  internally  in
           UTF8 no longer causes panics [perl #75898].

       •   Syntax  errors  in  "(?{...})"  blocks  in  regular  expressions no longer cause panic messages [perl
           #2353].

       •   Perl 5.10.0 introduced some faulty logic that made "U*" in the middle of a pack  template  equivalent
           to "U0" if the input string was empty.  This has been fixed [perl #90160].

</pre><h4><b>Errata</b></h4><pre>
   <b>split()</b> <b>and</b> <b>@_</b>
       <b>split()</b>  no  longer modifies @_ when called in scalar or void context.  In void context it now produces a
       "Useless use of split" warning.  This is actually a change introduced in perl 5.12.0, but it  was  missed
       from that release's perl5120delta.

</pre><h4><b>Acknowledgements</b></h4><pre>
       Perl   5.12.5  represents  approximately  17  months  of  development  since  Perl  5.12.4  and  contains
       approximately 1,900 lines of changes across 64 files from 18 authors.

       Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users  and  developers.
       The following people are known to have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.12.5:

       Andy  Dougherty,  Chris  'BinGOs'  Williams,  Craig  A. Berry, David Mitchell, Dominic Hargreaves, Father
       Chrysostomos, Florian Ragwitz, George Greer, Goro Fuji, Jesse Vincent,  Karl  Williamson,  Leon  Brocard,
       Nicholas Clark, Rafael Garcia-Suarez, Reini Urban, Ricardo Signes, Steve Hay, Tony Cook.

       The  list  above  is  almost  certainly  incomplete as it is automatically generated from version control
       history. In particular, it does not include the names of the (very  much  appreciated)  contributors  who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many  of  the  changes  included  in this version originated in the CPAN modules included in Perl's core.
       We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for helping Perl to flourish.

       For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see the  <u>AUTHORS</u>  file  in  the
       Perl source distribution.

</pre><h4><b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  find  what  you  think  is  a  bug,  you  might  check  the  articles  recently  posted  to  the
       comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at <a href="http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/">http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/</a> .  There may  also
       be information at <a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a> , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the <b>perlbug</b> program included with your release.  Be
       sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of
       "perl -V", will be sent off to <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a> to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly
       archived  mailing  list,  then  please send it to <a href="mailto:perl5-security-report@perl.org">perl5-security-report@perl.org</a>. This points to a closed
       subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able to help  assess
       the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or
       fix  the  problem  across  all  platforms  on  which  Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
       security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
