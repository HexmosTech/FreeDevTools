       p2v-release-notes - virt-p2v Release Notes

</pre><h4><b>RELEASE</b> <b>NOTES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VIRT-P2V</b> <b>1.42.0</b></h4><pre>
       These release notes only cover the differences from the previous version.  For detailed changelogs,
       please see the git repository.

       •   The "rhv-upload" output mode of virt-v2v is not listed as output driver, as virt-p2v does not provide
           all the GUI elements to properly use it (Pino Toscano).

       •   Virt-v2v  is  checked  as  requirement  for the functional tests, in addition to guestfish, and virt-
           customize (Pino Toscano).

       •   Virt-p2v-make-disk now sets "p2v.local" as hostname in the generated disk image (Pino Toscano).

       •   Document  "p2v"  as  initial  password  for  the  root  user  on  the   disk   image   generated   by
           virt-p2v-make-disk, virt-p2v-make-kickstart, and virt-p2v-make-kiwi (Pino Toscano).

</pre><h4><b>RELEASE</b> <b>NOTES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VIRT-P2V</b> <b>1.41.0</b></h4><pre>
       This is the first standalone release of virt-p2v, split from the libguestfs sources.

       There are no functionality changes compared to virt-p2v shipped as part of libguestfs 1.40.

</pre><h4><b>RELEASE</b> <b>NOTES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>HISTORICAL</b> <b>VERSIONS</b> <b>OF</b> <b>VIRT-P2V</b></h4><pre>
       Before  1.41.0  virt-p2v  was  released  as part of libguestfs.  Therefore, release notes for these older
       versions are found as part of the release notes of libguestfs.
