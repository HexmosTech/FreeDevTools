       guestfs-release-notes - libguestfs Release Notes

</pre><h4><b>RELEASE</b> <b>NOTES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>LIBGUESTFS</b> <b>1.46</b></h4><pre>
       The big news in this release is that the virt tools like <b><a href="../man1/virt-builder.1.html">virt-builder</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/virt-cat.1.html">virt-cat</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/virt-customize.1.html">virt-customize</a></b>(1),
       <b><a href="../man1/virt-df.1.html">virt-df</a></b>(1), and many more were moved to a new project.  The temporary repository for the new guestfs-
       tools project is here: https://github.com/rwmjones/guestfs-tools while we set up a permanent home for it
       on gitlab.  The tarballs containing the tools are here: https://download.libguestfs.org/guestfs-tools/

       Spinning out all of the tools into a new repository has made libguestfs a bit easier and simpler to build
       and manage, and allows us to focus on just being the API.

       Note that the tools <b><a href="../man1/guestfish.1.html">guestfish</a></b>(1) (which is really a "shell API"), <b><a href="../man1/guestmount.1.html">guestmount</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/libguestfs-test-tool.1.html">libguestfs-test-tool</a></b>(1)
       and <b><a href="../man1/virt-rescue.1.html">virt-rescue</a></b>(1) are still part of the libguestfs repo.

       The not quite so big news is that we have moved away from FreeNode to Libera Chat for IRC.  The new
       channel on Libera is called "#guestfs" (thanks Daniel Berrangé).

   <b>Language</b> <b>bindings</b>
       Libguestfs is now compatible with Go 1.16, and defines a Go module (thanks Gianfranco Costamagna).

       Memory leaks in Python APIs that returned structs are fixed (thanks 朱丹).

       Python PyPi code has been relicensed to LGPLv2+ (from GPLv2+).

   <b>Inspection</b>
       Inspection of RPM guests now uses librpm instead of trying to parse the Berkeley DB directly.  Since most
       RPM-based guests have replaced BDB with sqlite this allows us to read these newer guests while retaining
       compatibility with the older guests (thanks Panu Matilainen).

       Inspection of RHEL 8+ with split <a href="file:/usr">/usr</a> configuration has been made more reliable.

       Inspection of Windows Server 2022 should now work correctly (Yongkui Guo).

   <b>API</b>
       <u>New</u> <u>APIs</u>

       No new APIs were added in libguestfs 1.46.

       <u>Other</u> <u>API</u> <u>changes</u>

       The output of the "guestfs_cap_get_file" API has changed slightly because of changes in the underlying
       libcap.  This isn't strictly speaking an API break because the new output is a still valid but more
       compact description of file capabilities, but because it is different it may cause problems for users of
       the API.

       The "guestfs_mkfs_btrfs" API now ignores the "allocstart" parameter since it was deprecated by btrfs
       4.14.1 and later removed.

       "guestfs_isoinfo_*" APIs now directly parse the CD Primary Volume Descriptor instead of using an external
       tool.  The APIs should appear to work exactly the same (thanks Thomas Schmitt).

       You can now force the appliance to use KVM or fail if not supported (Sam Eiderman).

       Because of a change to XFS in version 5, disabling lazy-counters no longer works.  The API still works
       for earlier versions of XFS (Laszlo Ersek).

   <b>Build</b> <b>changes</b>
       The build now uses and requires PCRE2 (instead of PCRE).

       This version requires libvirt ≥ 7.1.0, if libvirt is enabled.

       gnulib is no longer bundled with libguestfs, making builds from git much simpler.

       Perl "Sys::Virt" (libvirt bindings for Perl) are no longer required by libguestfs.

       The code has been compiled with both LTO and GCC <u>-fanalyzer</u> and many bugs and warnings fixed.

       Allow projects like guestfs-tools and virt-v2v to be compiled with locally built (but not installed)
       libguestfs (Laszlo Ersek).

       Tests now run in parallel (many additional fixes by Laszlo Ersek).

       Work around RAID0 regression in Linux 3.14/5.4 (Laszlo Ersek).

       Support for RISC-V (Heinrich Schuchardt).

       Support for building on Alma and Cloud Linux (Александр Кравченко).

       Fix to compile with OCaml 4.12.

       The tarball no longer includes the <u>ChangeLog</u> file.  To get a detailed changelog, please look at the
       upstream git repository.

       Don't assume bash in the <u>./configure</u> script (Martin Kletzander).

       Fix <u>./configure</u> <u>--with-distro</u> option (Alexandre Iooss).

       Various fixes for qemu 6.1.

       Fix creating appliance dependencies on Debian (Hilko Bengen).

       Update appliance packages on SUSE and several other improvements to the init script (Olaf Hering).

   <b>Internals</b>
       We now use the qemu / libvirt feature <u>-cpu</u> <u>max</u> to select the best CPU to run the appliance.  This should
       improve performance for things like encrypted disks (Daniel Berrangé).

       When passing the appliance filesystem UUID to supermin we now read it directly out of the appliance
       instead of using the <b><a href="../man1/file.1.html">file</a></b>(1) program.  This is more reliable, especially as file often breaks or changed
       its output.

       The qemu <u>-enable-fips</u> option is no longer used.  It was not needed and has been deprecated by qemu.

       On Fedora, pull in glibc-gconv-extra to fix the "guestfs_syslinux" API (Yongkui Guo).

       We no longer use qemu's sga (Serial Graphics Adapter) option ROM, instead using the equivalent seabios
       feature.
