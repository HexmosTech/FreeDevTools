</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl5202delta - what is new for perl v5.20.2

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.20.1 release and the 5.20.2 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.20.0, first read perl5201delta, which describes
       differences between 5.20.0 and 5.20.1.

</pre><h4><b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.20.1.  If any exist, they are bugs, and we request
       that you submit a report.  See "Reporting Bugs" below.

</pre><h4><b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Updated</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b>
       •   attributes has been upgraded from version 0.22 to 0.23.

           The     usage     of     "memEQs"     in    the    XS    has    been    corrected.     [GH    #14072]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14072&gt;

       •   Data::Dumper has been upgraded from version 2.151 to 2.151_01.

           Fixes CVE-2014-4330 by adding a configuration variable/option to limit recursion  when  dumping  deep
           data structures.

       •   Errno has been upgraded from version 1.20_03 to 1.20_05.

           Warnings when building the XS on Windows with the Visual C++ compiler are now avoided.

       •   feature has been upgraded from version 1.36 to 1.36_01.

           The  "postderef" feature has now been documented.  This feature was actually added in Perl 5.20.0 but
           was accidentally omitted from the feature documentation until now.

       •   IO::Socket has been upgraded from version 1.37 to 1.38.

           Document     the     limitations     of      the      <b>connected()</b>      method.       [GH      #14199]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14199&gt;

       •   Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 5.020001 to 5.20150214.

           The list of Perl versions covered has been updated.

       •   PathTools has been upgraded from version 3.48 to 3.48_01.

           A warning from the <b>gcc</b> compiler is now avoided when building the XS.

       •   PerlIO::scalar has been upgraded from version 0.18 to 0.18_01.

           Reading  from  a  position  well  past  the end of the scalar now correctly returns end of file.  [GH
           #14342] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14342&gt;

           Seeking to a negative position still fails, but no longer leaves the file position set to a  negation
           location.

           eof()  on  a "PerlIO::scalar" handle now properly returns true when the file position is past the 2GB
           mark on 32-bit systems.

       •   Storable has been upgraded from version 2.49 to 2.49_01.

           Minor grammatical change to the documentation only.

       •   VMS::DCLsym has been upgraded from version 1.05 to 1.05_01.

           Minor formatting change to the documentation only.

       •   VMS::Stdio has been upgraded from version 2.4 to 2.41.

           Minor formatting change to the documentation only.

</pre><h4><b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>New</b> <b>Documentation</b>
       <u>perlunicook</u>

       This document, by Tom Christiansen, provides examples of handling Unicode in Perl.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Existing</b> <b>Documentation</b>
       <u>perlexperiment</u>

       •   Added reference to subroutine signatures.  This feature was actually added in  Perl  5.20.0  but  was
           accidentally omitted from the experimental feature documentation until now.

       <u>perlpolicy</u>

       •   The process whereby features may graduate from experimental status has now been formally documented.

       <u>perlsyn</u>

       •   An  ambiguity  in  the  documentation  of  the  ellipsis  statement  has been corrected.  [GH #14054]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14054&gt;

</pre><h4><b>Diagnostics</b></h4><pre>
       The following additions or changes have been made to diagnostic  output,  including  warnings  and  fatal
       error messages.  For the complete list of diagnostic messages, see perldiag.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Existing</b> <b>Diagnostics</b>
       •   Bad  symbol  for  scalar is now documented.  This error is not new, but was not previously documented
           here.

       •   Missing right brace on \N{} is now documented.  This  error  is  not  new,  but  was  not  previously
           documented here.

</pre><h4><b>Testing</b></h4><pre>
       •   The    test    script    <u>re/rt122747.t</u>    has    been    added    to    verify   that   [GH   #14081]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14081&gt; remains fixed.

</pre><h4><b>Platform</b> <b>Support</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Regained</b> <b>Platforms</b>
       IRIX and Tru64 platforms are working again.  (Some "make test" failures remain.)

</pre><h4><b>Selected</b> <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b></h4><pre>
       •   AIX     now     sets     the     length     in     "getsockopt"     correctly.       [GH      #13484]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/13484&gt;,                      [cpan                      #91183]
           &lt;https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=91183&gt;,                   [cpan                   #85570]
           &lt;https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=85570&gt;

       •   In  Perl 5.20.0, $^N accidentally had the internal UTF8 flag turned off if accessed from a code block
           within a regular expression, effectively UTF8-encoding the value.  This has been fixed.  [GH  #14211]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14211&gt;

       •   Various  cases  where the name of a sub is used (autoload, overloading, error messages) used to crash
           for lexical subs, but have been fixed.

       •   An assertion failure when parsing  "sort"  with  debugging  enabled  has  been  fixed.   [GH  #14087]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14087&gt;

       •   Loading  UTF8 tables during a regular expression match could cause assertion failures under debugging
           builds  if  the  previous   match   used   the   very   same   regular   expression.    [GH   #14081]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14081&gt;

       •   Due  to  a  mistake  in the string-copying logic, copying the value of a state variable could instead
           steal the value and undefine the variable.  This bug, introduced in Perl 5.20,  would  happen  mostly
           for  long  strings  (1250 chars or more), but could happen for any strings under builds with copy-on-
           write disabled.  [GH #14175] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14175&gt;

       •   Fixed a bug that could cause perl to execute  an  infinite  loop  during  compilation.   [GH  #14165]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14165&gt;

       •   On  Win32,  restoring  in  a  child  pseudo-process a variable that was local()ed in a parent pseudo-
           process before the "fork" happened caused memory corruption and a crash in the  child  pseudo-process
           (and therefore OS process).  [GH #8641] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/8641&gt;

       •   Tainted  constants  evaluated at compile time no longer cause unrelated statements to become tainted.
           [GH #14059] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14059&gt;

       •   Calling "write" on a format with a "^**" field could produce a  panic  in  <b>sv_chop()</b>  if  there  were
           insufficient  arguments  or  if  the  variable  used  to  fill  the  field  was  empty.   [GH #14255]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14255&gt;

       •   In Perl 5.20.0, "sort CORE::fake" where 'fake' is anything other than a keyword started  chopping  of
           the last 6 characters and treating the result as a sort sub name.  The previous behaviour of treating
           "CORE::fake"     as     a     sort     sub     name     has     been     restored.     [GH    #14323]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14323&gt;

       •   A bug in regular expression patterns that could lead to segfaults and other crashes has  been  fixed.
           This occurred only in patterns compiled with "/i", while taking into account the current POSIX locale
           (this  usually  means they have to be compiled within the scope of "use locale"), and there must be a
           string    of    at     least     128     consecutive     bytes     to     match.      [GH     #14389]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14389&gt;

       •   "qr/@array(?{block})/"    no   longer   dies   with   "Bizarre   copy   of   ARRAY".    [GH   #14292]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14292&gt;

       •   "gmtime"     no     longer     crashes     with      not-a-number      values.       [GH      #14365]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14365&gt;

       •   Certain  syntax  errors  in  substitutions, such as "s/${&lt;&gt;{})//", would crash, and had done so since
           Perl 5.10.  (In some cases the crash did not start happening until Perl 5.16.)   The  crash  has,  of
           course, been fixed.  [GH #14391] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14391&gt;

       •   A  memory  leak  in some regular expressions, introduced in Perl 5.20.1, has been fixed.  [GH #14236]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14236&gt;

       •   "formline("@...", "a");" would crash.  The "FF_CHECKNL" case in <b>pp_formline()</b> didn't set the  pointer
           used  to  mark the chop position, which led to the "FF_MORE" case crashing with a segmentation fault.
           This  has  been  fixed.   [GH  #14388]   &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14388&gt;   [GH   #14425]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14425&gt;

       •   A  possible  buffer  overrun  and  crash  when  parsing  a  literal pattern during regular expression
           compilation has been fixed.  [GH #14416] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14416&gt;

</pre><h4><b>Known</b> <b>Problems</b></h4><pre>
       •   It is a known bug that lexical subroutines cannot be used as the "SUBNAME" argument to "sort".   This
           will be fixed in a future version of Perl.

</pre><h4><b>Errata</b> <b>From</b> <b>Previous</b> <b>Releases</b></h4><pre>
       •   A regression has been fixed that was introduced in Perl 5.20.0 (fixed in Perl 5.20.1 as well as here)
           in  which  a  UTF-8  encoded regular expression pattern that contains a single ASCII lowercase letter
           does not match its uppercase counterpart.  [GH #14051] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14051&gt;

</pre><h4><b>Acknowledgements</b></h4><pre>
       Perl 5.20.2 represents approximately 5 months of development since Perl 5.20.1 and contains approximately
       6,300 lines of changes across 170 files from 34 authors.

       Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were approximately 1,900 lines  of
       changes to 80 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

       Perl  continues  to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and developers.
       The following people are known to have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.20.2:

       Aaron Crane, Abigail, Andreas Voegele,  Andy  Dougherty,  Anthony  Heading,  Aristotle  Pagaltzis,  Chris
       'BinGOs'  Williams, Craig A. Berry, Daniel Dragan, Doug Bell, Ed J, Father Chrysostomos, Glenn D. Golden,
       H.Merijn Brand, Hugo van der Sanden, James E Keenan, Jarkko Hietaniemi, Jim Cromie, Karen Etheridge, Karl
       Williamson, kmx, Matthew Horsfall, Max Maischein, Peter Martini, Rafael  Garcia-Suarez,  Ricardo  Signes,
       Shlomi  Fish,  Slaven  Rezic,  Steffen  Müller,  Steve Hay, Tadeusz Sośnierz, Tony Cook, Yves Orton, Ævar
       Arnfjörð Bjarmason.

       The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it  is  automatically  generated  from  version  control
       history.   In  particular,  it does not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN  modules  included  in  Perl's  core.
       We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for helping Perl to flourish.

       For  a  more  complete  list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see the <u>AUTHORS</u> file in the
       Perl source distribution.

</pre><h4><b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  find  what  you  think  is  a  bug,  you  might  check  the  articles  recently  posted  to  the
       comp.lang.perl.misc  newsgroup  and  the  perl  bug database at https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be
       information at <a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a> , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with your release.  Be
       sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of
       "perl -V", will be sent off to <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a> to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly
       archived mailing list, then please send it to <a href="mailto:perl5-security-report@perl.org">perl5-security-report@perl.org</a>.  This points  to  a  closed
       subscription  unarchived  mailing  list, which includes all the core committers, who will be able to help
       assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate  the  release  of  patches  to
       mitigate  or  fix  the  problem  across  all  platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this
       address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
