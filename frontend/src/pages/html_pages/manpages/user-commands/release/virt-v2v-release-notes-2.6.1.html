</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       virt-v2v-release-notes - virt-v2v release notes for 2.6

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These are the release notes for <b>virt-v2v</b> <b>2.6</b>.  This describes the major changes since 2.4.

       Virt-v2v 2.6.0 was released on <b>8</b> <b>October</b> <b>2024</b>.

   <b>New</b> <b>features</b>
       You can now use most <b><a href="../man1/virt-customize.1.html">virt-customize</a></b>(1) options, such as installing arbitrary firstboot scripts, uploading
       or editing files, etc. during conversions.

       Installation of QEMU Guest Agent in Windows guests has been revised and made much more reliable.  Note
       that a visible effect of this change is that Windows guests may reboot four or more times during the
       first boot after conversion (which is necessary).  (Thanks Vadim Rozenfeld, Konstantin Kostiuk, Yuri
       Benditovich, Yan Vugenfirer).

       We now forcibly online all virtio disks during firstboot, working around a security mitigation in recent
       versions of Windows that offlines them if they change bus (Martin Necas).

       QEMU Balloon Server (blnsvr) is now installed in Windows guests, if found on the virtio-win ISO.  This
       improves statistics gathering for these guests.

       Add support for Circle Linux (Bella Zhang).

       Add some support for LoongArch guests (liuxiang).

   <b>Other</b> <b>fixes</b>
       <u>-i</u> <u>ova</u> mode now uses the detected guest firmware, if it's not specified in the OVA metadata (Bella
       Khizgiyaev).

       <u>-o</u> <u>kubevirt</u> output mode has been substantially changed to fix multiple problems.  It should be more
       compatible with real KubeVirt instances now.  (Thanks Arik Hadas, Bella Khizgiyaev, Lee Yarwood, Martin
       Necas).

       <u>-o</u> <u>libvirt</u> mode now includes an &lt;os firmware&gt; attribute specifying whether the guest needs BIOS or UEFI
       to boot.

       The output of <b><a href="../man1/virt-v2v-inspector.1.html">virt-v2v-inspector</a></b>(1) has been revised, with much more metadata available.

       The <u>--mac</u> option now allows the gateway and network mask length to be empty (Arik Hadas).

       The debug output of virt-v2v has been improved.  Now when searching the log for important events, you can
       just use the regular expression "/^info:/"

   <b>Build</b> <b>changes</b>
       We no longer require external ssh/scp commands for input mode <u>-i</u> <u>vmx</u>.  Instead we use
       <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-ssh-plugin.1.html">nbdkit-ssh-plugin</a></b>(1) (this is not a new requirement as it is already being used for file transfer).  This
       makes remote file detection more predictable, and also allows the <u>-ip</u> option to be used to specify a
       password.  (Thanks Ming Xie, Laszlo Ersek).

       OCaml bytecode compilation now outputs the whole exe to make it more resistant to being stripped (Jerry
       James).

       Multiple test files which were copied over from libguestfs but not actually used by virt-v2v tests have
       been deleted.

   <b>Internals</b>
       Added a test for <u>-o</u> <u>kubevirt</u> mode.
