</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl5242delta - what is new for perl v5.24.2

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.24.1 release and the 5.24.2 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.24.0, first read perl5241delta, which describes
       differences between 5.24.0 and 5.24.1.

</pre><h4><b>Security</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Improved</b> <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>'.'</b> <b>in</b> <b>@INC</b> <b>in</b> <b>base.pm</b>
       The handling of (the removal of) '.' in @INC in base has been improved.  This resolves some problematic
       behaviour in the approach taken in Perl 5.24.1, which is probably best described in the following two
       threads on the Perl 5 Porters mailing list:
       &lt;<a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2016/08/msg238991.html">http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2016/08/msg238991.html</a>&gt;,
       &lt;<a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2016/10/msg240297.html">http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2016/10/msg240297.html</a>&gt;.

   <b>"Escaped"</b> <b>colons</b> <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> <b>paths</b> <b>in</b> <b>PATH</b>
       On Unix systems, Perl treats any relative paths in the PATH environment variable as tainted when starting
       a new process.  Previously, it was allowing a backslash to escape a colon (unlike the OS), consequently
       allowing relative paths to be considered safe if the PATH was set to something like "/\:.".  The check
       has been fixed to treat "." as tainted in that example.

</pre><h4><b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Updated</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b>
       •   base has been upgraded from version 2.23 to 2.23_01.

       •   Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 5.20170114_24 to 5.20170715_24.

</pre><h4><b>Selected</b> <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b></h4><pre>
       •   Fixed  a  crash  with "s///l" where it thought it was dealing with UTF-8 when it wasn't.  [GH #15543]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15543&gt;

</pre><h4><b>Acknowledgements</b></h4><pre>
       Perl 5.24.2 represents approximately 6 months of development since Perl 5.24.1 and contains approximately
       2,500 lines of changes across 53 files from 18 authors.

       Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were approximately  960  lines  of
       changes to 17 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

       Perl  continues  to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and developers.
       The following people are known to have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.24.2:

       Aaron Crane, Abigail, Aristotle Pagaltzis, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Dan  Collins,  David  Mitchell,  Eric
       Herman,  Father  Chrysostomos, James E Keenan, Karl Williamson, Lukas Mai, Renee Baecker, Ricardo Signes,
       Sawyer X, Stevan Little, Steve Hay, Tony Cook, Yves Orton.

       The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it  is  automatically  generated  from  version  control
       history.   In  particular,  it does not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN  modules  included  in  Perl's  core.
       We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for helping Perl to flourish.

       For  a  more  complete  list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see the <u>AUTHORS</u> file in the
       Perl source distribution.

</pre><h4><b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  find  what  you  think  is  a  bug,  you  might  check  the  articles  recently  posted  to  the
       comp.lang.perl.misc  newsgroup  and  the perl bug database at &lt;https://rt.perl.org/&gt; .  There may also be
       information at &lt;<a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a>&gt; , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with your release.  Be
       sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of
       "perl -V", will be sent off to <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a> to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it inappropriate to send to a  publicly
       archived  mailing  list,  then see "SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION" in perlsec for details of
       how to report the issue.
