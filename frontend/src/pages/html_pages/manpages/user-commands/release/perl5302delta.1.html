</pre><h4><b>Acknowledgements</b></h4><pre>
       Perl 5.30.2 represents approximately 4 months of development since Perl 5.30.1 and contains approximately
       2,100 lines of changes across 110 files from 15 authors.

       Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were approximately  920  lines  of
       changes to 30 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

       Perl  continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and developers.
       The following people are known to have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.30.2:

       Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Dan Book, David Mitchell, Hugo van der Sanden, Karen Etheridge, Karl Williamson,
       Matthew Horsfall, Nicolas R., Petr Písař, Renee Baecker, Sawyer X,  Steve  Hay,  Tomasz  Konojacki,  Tony
       Cook, Yves Orton.

       The  list  above  is  almost  certainly  incomplete as it is automatically generated from version control
       history.  In particular, it does not include the names of the (very much  appreciated)  contributors  who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many  of  the  changes  included  in this version originated in the CPAN modules included in Perl's core.
       We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for helping Perl to flourish.

       For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see the  <u>AUTHORS</u>  file  in  the
       Perl source distribution.

</pre><h4><b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  find  what  you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database at &lt;https://rt.perl.org/&gt;.
       There may also be information at &lt;<a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a>&gt;, the Perl Home Page.

       If    you    believe    you    have    an    unreported    bug,    please    open     an     issue     at
       &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues&gt;.   Be  sure  to  trim  your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test
       case.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it inappropriate to send  to  a  public
       issue  tracker,  then  see  "SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION" in perlsec for details of how to
       report the issue.

</pre><h4><b>Give</b> <b>Thanks</b></h4><pre>
       If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5, you can do so by running  the
       "perlthanks" program:

           perlthanks

       This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of thanks.
