</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl5361delta - what is new for perl v5.36.1

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.36.0 release and the 5.36.1 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.35.0, first read perl5360delta, which describes
       differences between 5.35.0 and 5.36.0.

</pre><h4><b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.36.0.  If any exist, they are bugs, and we request
       that you submit a report.  See "Reporting Bugs" below.

</pre><h4><b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Updated</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b>
       •   Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 5.20220520 to 5.20230423.

</pre><h4><b>Configuration</b> <b>and</b> <b>Compilation</b></h4><pre>
       •   "Configure"  probed  for  the  return type of <b>malloc()</b> and <b>free()</b> by testing whether declarations for
           those functions produced a function type mismatch with the implementation.  On Solaris,  with  a  C++
           compiler,  this  check  always failed, since Solaris instead imports <b>malloc()</b> and <b>free()</b> from "std::"
           with "using" for C++ builds.  Since the return types of <b>malloc()</b> and <b>free()</b> are well defined by the C
           standard, skip probing for them.  "Configure" command-line arguments and  hints  can  still  override
           these      type      in     the     unlikely     case     that     is     needed.      [GH     #20806
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/20806&gt;]

</pre><h4><b>Testing</b></h4><pre>
       Tests were added and changed to reflect the other additions and changes in this release.

</pre><h4><b>Selected</b> <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b></h4><pre>
       •   An <b>eval()</b> as the last statement in a regex code block could trigger an interpreter panic; e.g.

               /(?{ ...; eval {....}; })/

           [GH #19680 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/19680&gt;]

       •   An "eval EXPR" referring to a lexical  sub  defined  in  grandparent  scope  no  longer  produces  an
           assertion failures.  [GH #19857 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/19857&gt;]

       •   Writing  to a magic variables associated with the selected output handle, $^, $~, $=, "$-" and $%, no
           longer crashes perl if the IO object has been cleared from the selected output  handle.   [GH  #20733
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/20733&gt;]

</pre><h4><b>Acknowledgements</b></h4><pre>
       Perl   5.36.1  represents  approximately  11  months  of  development  since  Perl  5.36.0  and  contains
       approximately 5,500 lines of changes across 62 files from 24 authors.

       Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were approximately 1,600 lines  of
       changes to 23 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

       Perl  continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and developers.
       The following people are known to have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.36.1:

       Andreas König, Bram, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Craig A. Berry, Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsåker,  David  Mitchell,
       Elvin  Aslanov,  Florian Weimer, Graham Knop, Hugo van der Sanden, Karen Etheridge, Karl Williamson, Leon
       Timmermans, Matthew Horsfall, Max Maischein, Neil Bowers,  Nicolas  R,  Renee  Baecker,  Ricardo  Signes,
       Richard Leach, Steve Hay, Todd Rinaldo, Tony Cook, Yves Orton.

       The  list  above  is  almost  certainly  incomplete as it is automatically generated from version control
       history.  In particular, it does not include the names of the (very much  appreciated)  contributors  who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many  of  the  changes  included  in this version originated in the CPAN modules included in Perl's core.
       We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for helping Perl to flourish.

       For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see the  <u>AUTHORS</u>  file  in  the
       Perl source distribution.

</pre><h4><b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       If   you   find   what   you   think   is   a   bug,   you   might   check   the  perl  bug  database  at
       &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues&gt;.  There may also be  information  at  &lt;<a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a>&gt;,  the
       Perl Home Page.

       If     you     believe     you    have    an    unreported    bug,    please    open    an    issue    at
       &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues&gt;.  Be sure to trim your bug down to  a  tiny  but  sufficient  test
       case.

       If  the  bug  you are reporting has security implications which make it inappropriate to send to a public
       issue tracker, then see "SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION" in perlsec for  details  of  how  to
       report the issue.

</pre><h4><b>Give</b> <b>Thanks</b></h4><pre>
       If  you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5, you can do so by running the

           perlthanks

       This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of thanks.
