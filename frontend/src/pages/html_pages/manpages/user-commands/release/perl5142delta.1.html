</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl5142delta - what is new for perl v5.14.2

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.14.1 release and the 5.14.2 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.14.0, first read perl5141delta, which describes
       differences between 5.14.0 and 5.14.1.

</pre><h4><b>Core</b> <b>Enhancements</b></h4><pre>
       No changes since 5.14.0.

</pre><h4><b>Security</b></h4><pre>
   <b>File::Glob::bsd_glob()</b> <b>memory</b> <b>error</b> <b>with</b> <b>GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC</b> <b>(CVE-2011-2728)</b>
       Calling "File::Glob::bsd_glob" with the unsupported flag GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC would cause an access violation
       / segfault.  A Perl program that accepts a flags value from an external source could expose itself to
       denial of service or arbitrary code execution attacks.  There are no known exploits in the wild.  The
       problem has been corrected by explicitly disabling all unsupported flags and setting unused function
       pointers to null.  Bug reported by Clément Lecigne.

   <b>"Encode"</b> <b>decode_xs</b> <b>n-byte</b> <b>heap-overflow</b> <b>(CVE-2011-2939)</b>
       A bug in "Encode" could, on certain inputs, cause the heap to overflow.  This problem has been corrected.
       Bug reported by Robert Zacek.

</pre><h4><b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.14.0. If any exist, they are bugs and reports are
       welcome.

</pre><h4><b>Deprecations</b></h4><pre>
       There have been no deprecations since 5.14.0.

</pre><h4><b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b></h4><pre>
   <b>New</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b>
       None

   <b>Updated</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b>
       •   CPAN has been upgraded from version 1.9600 to version 1.9600_01.

           CPAN::Distribution has been upgraded from version 1.9602 to 1.9602_01.

           Backported  bugfixes  from  CPAN  version  1.9800.   Ensures proper detection of "configure_requires"
           prerequisites from CPAN Meta files in the case where "dynamic_config" is true.  [rt.cpan.org #68835]

           Also ensures that "configure_requires" is only checked in META files, not MYMETA  files,  so  protect
           against MYMETA generation that drops "configure_requires".

       •   Encode has been upgraded from version 2.42 to 2.42_01.

           See "Security".

       •   File::Glob has been upgraded from version 1.12 to version 1.13.

           See "Security".

       •   PerlIO::scalar has been upgraded from version 0.11 to 0.11_01.

           It  fixes  a  problem  with  "open  my  $fh, "&gt;", \$scalar" not working if $scalar is a copy-on-write
           scalar.

   <b>Removed</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b>
       None

</pre><h4><b>Platform</b> <b>Support</b></h4><pre>
   <b>New</b> <b>Platforms</b>
       None

   <b>Discontinued</b> <b>Platforms</b>
       None

   <b>Platform-Specific</b> <b>Notes</b>
       HP-UX PA-RISC/64 now supports gcc-4.x
           A fix to correct the socketsize now makes the test suite pass on HP-UX PA-RISC for 64bitall builds.

       Building on OS X 10.7 Lion and Xcode 4 works again
           The build system has been updated to work with the build tools under Mac OS X 10.7.

</pre><h4><b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b></h4><pre>
       •   In @INC filters (subroutines returned by subroutines in @INC), $_ used to misbehave: If returned from
           a subroutine, it would not be copied, but the variable itself  would  be  returned;  and  freeing  $_
           (e.g., with "undef *_") would cause perl to crash.  This has been fixed [perl #91880].

       •   Perl  5.10.0  introduced some faulty logic that made "U*" in the middle of a pack template equivalent
           to "U0" if the input string was empty.  This has been fixed [perl #90160].

       •   "caller" no longer leaks memory when called from the DB package if @DB::args was  assigned  to  after
           the first call to "caller".  Carp was triggering this bug [perl #97010].

       •   "utf8::decode"  had  a  nasty  bug  that  would modify copy-on-write scalars' string buffers in place
           (i.e., skipping the copy).  This could result in hashes having two elements with the same  key  [perl
           #91834].

       •   Localising a tied variable used to make it read-only if it contained a copy-on-write string.

       •   Elements  of  restricted  hashes  (see the fields pragma) containing copy-on-write values couldn't be
           deleted, nor could such hashes be cleared ("%hash = ()").

       •   Locking a hash element that is a glob copy no longer causes subsequent assignment to  it  to  corrupt
           the glob.

       •   A  panic involving the combination of the regular expression modifiers "/aa" introduced in 5.14.0 and
           the "\b" escape sequence has been fixed [perl #95964].

</pre><h4><b>Known</b> <b>Problems</b></h4><pre>
       This is a list of some significant unfixed bugs, which are regressions from 5.12.0.

       •   "PERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT" is broken.

           Since perl 5.14.0, building with "-DPERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT" hasn't been possible. This  means  that  perl
           currently doesn't work on any platforms that require it to be built this way, including Symbian.

           While  "PERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT"  now  works  again  on  recent  development versions of perl, it actually
           working on Symbian again hasn't been verified.

           We'd be very interested in hearing from anyone working with Perl on Symbian.

</pre><h4><b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  find  what  you  think  is  a  bug,  you  might  check  the  articles  recently  posted  to  the
       comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at <a href="http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/">http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/</a> .  There may  also
       be information at <a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a> , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with your release.  Be
       sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of
       "perl -V", will be sent off to <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a> to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly
       archived  mailing  list,  then  please send it to <a href="mailto:perl5-security-report@perl.org">perl5-security-report@perl.org</a>. This points to a closed
       subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able to help  assess
       the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or
       fix  the  problem  across  all  platforms  on  which  Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
       security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
