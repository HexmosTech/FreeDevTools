</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl5122delta - what is new for perl v5.12.2

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.12.1 release and the 5.12.2 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier major version, such as 5.10.1, first read perl5120delta, which
       describes differences between 5.10.0 and 5.12.0, as well as perl5121delta, which describes earlier
       changes in the 5.12 stable release series.

</pre><h4><b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.12.1. If any exist, they are bugs and reports are
       welcome.

</pre><h4><b>Core</b> <b>Enhancements</b></h4><pre>
       Other than the bug fixes listed below, there should be no user-visible changes to the core language in
       this release.

</pre><h4><b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b></h4><pre>
   <b>New</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b>
       This release does not introduce any new modules or pragmata.

   <b>Pragmata</b> <b>Changes</b>
       In the previous release, "no <u>VERSION</u>;" statements triggered a bug which could cause feature bundles to be
       loaded and strict mode to be enabled unintentionally.

   <b>Updated</b> <b>Modules</b>
       "Carp"
           Upgraded from version 1.16 to 1.17.

           Carp  now  detects  incomplete  <b>caller()</b>  overrides  and  avoids  using  bogus  @DB::args. To provide
           backtraces, Carp relies on particular behaviour of the caller built-in. Carp  now  detects  if  other
           code  has  overridden this with an incomplete implementation, and modifies its backtrace accordingly.
           Previously incomplete overrides would cause incorrect values in backtraces (best  case),  or  obscure
           fatal errors (worst case)

           This  fixes  certain  cases  of  "Bizarre  copy  of  ARRAY"  caused  by  modules  overriding caller()
           incorrectly.

       "CPANPLUS"
           A patch to <u>cpanp-run-perl</u>  has  been  backported  from  CPANPLUS  0.9004.  This  resolves  RT  #55964
           &lt;<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html">http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html</a>?id=55964&gt;             and            RT            #57106
           &lt;<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html">http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html</a>?id=57106&gt;, both of which related to failures  to  install
           distributions that use "Module::Install::DSL".

       "File::Glob"
           A  regression which caused a failure to find "CORE::GLOBAL::glob" after loading "File::Glob" to crash
           has been fixed.  Now, it correctly falls back to external globbing via "pp_glob".

       "File::Copy"
           "File::Copy::copy(FILE, DIR)" is now documented.

       "File::Spec"
           Upgraded from version 3.31 to 3.31_01.

           Several portability fixes were made in "File::Spec::VMS": a colon is now recognized as a delimiter in
           native filespecs; caret-escaped delimiters are recognized for better handling of extended  filespecs;
           catpath() returns an empty directory rather than the current directory if the input directory name is
           empty; abs2rel() properly handles Unix-style input.

</pre><h4><b>Utility</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       •   <u>perlbug</u> now always gives the reporter a chance to change the email address it guesses for them.

       •   <u>perlbug</u> should no longer warn about uninitialized values when using the "-d" and "-v" options.

</pre><h4><b>Changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Existing</b> <b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
       •   The  existing  policy  on  backward-compatibility and deprecation has been added to perlpolicy, along
           with definitions of terms like <u>deprecation</u>.

       •   "srand" in perlfunc's usage has been clarified.

       •   The entry for "die" in perlfunc was reorganized to emphasize its role in the exception mechanism.

       •   Perl's INSTALL file has been clarified to explicitly state that Perl requires a C89 compliant ANSI  C
           Compiler.

       •   IO::Socket's getsockopt() and setsockopt() have been documented.

       •   <u><b>alarm()</b></u>'s inability to interrupt blocking IO on Windows has been documented.

       •   Math::TrulyRandom  hasn't  been updated since 1996 and has been removed as a recommended solution for
           random number generation.

       •   perlrun has been updated to clarify the behaviour of octal flags to <u>perl</u>.

       •   To ease user confusion, $# and $*, two special variables that were removed  in  earlier  versions  of
           Perl have been documented.

       •   The  version  of  perlfaq  shipped with the Perl core has been updated from the official FAQ version,
           which  is  now  maintained  in  the  "briandfoy/perlfaq"   branch   of   the   Perl   repository   at
           &lt;git://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>Installation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Configuration</b> <b>Improvements</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Configuration</b> <b>improvements</b>
       •   The "d_u32align" configuration probe on ARM has been fixed.

   <b>Compilation</b> <b>improvements</b>
       •   An  ""incompatible  operand  types"" error in ternary expressions when building with "clang" has been
           fixed.

       •   Perl now skips setuid "File::Copy" tests on partitions it detects to be mounted as "nosuid".

</pre><h4><b>Selected</b> <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b></h4><pre>
       •   A possible segfault in the "T_PRTOBJ" default typemap has been fixed.

       •   A possible memory leak when using <b>caller()</b> to set @DB::args has been fixed.

       •   Several memory leaks when loading XS modules were fixed.

       •   unpack() now handles scalar context correctly for %32H and %32u, fixing a potential  crash.   split()
           would  crash  because  the  third  item  on  the  stack  wasn't  the  regular expression it expected.
           "unpack("%2H", ...)" would return both the unpacked result and the checksum on the  stack,  as  would
           "unpack("%2u", ...)".  [GH #10257] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/10257&gt;

       •   Perl now avoids using memory after calling free() in <u>pp_require</u> when there are CODEREFs in @INC.

       •   A bug that could cause ""Unknown error"" messages when ""call_sv(code, G_EVAL)"" is called from an XS
           destructor has been fixed.

       •   The  implementation  of the "open $fh, '&gt;' \$buffer" feature now supports get/set magic and thus tied
           buffers correctly.

       •   The "pp_getc", "pp_tell", and "pp_eof" opcodes now make room on the stack for their return values  in
           cases where no argument was passed in.

       •   When  matching  unicode  strings  under  some conditions inappropriate backtracking would result in a
           "Malformed  UTF-8  character  (fatal)"  error.  This  should  no  longer  occur.   See   [GH  #10434]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/10434&gt;

</pre><h4><b>Platform</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Notes</b></h4><pre>
   <b>AIX</b>
       •   <u>README.aix</u> has been updated with information about the XL C/C++ V11 compiler suite.

   <b>Windows</b>
       •   When  building  Perl  with the mingw64 x64 cross-compiler "incpath", "libpth", "ldflags", "lddlflags"
           and "ldflags_nolargefiles" values in <u>Config.pm</u> and <u>Config_heavy.pl</u>  were  not  previously  being  set
           correctly  because,  with  that  compiler,  the include and lib directories are not immediately below
           "$(CCHOME)".

   <b>VMS</b>
       •   <u>git_version.h</u> is now installed on VMS. This was an oversight in v5.12.0 which caused some  extensions
           to fail to build.

       •   Several memory leaks in <b>stat()</b> have been fixed.

       •   A memory leak in Perl_rename() due to a double allocation has been fixed.

       •   A memory leak in vms_fid_to_name() (used by realpath() and realname()) has been fixed.

</pre><h4><b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  find  what  you  think  is  a  bug,  you  might  check  the  articles  recently  posted  to  the
       comp.lang.perl.misc  newsgroup and the perl bug database at <a href="http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/">http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/</a> .  There may also
       be information at <a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a> , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the <b>perlbug</b> program included with your release.  Be
       sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of
       "perl -V", will be sent off to <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a> to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly
       archived mailing list, then please send it to <a href="mailto:perl5-security-report@perl.org">perl5-security-report@perl.org</a>. This  points  to  a  closed
       subscription  unarchived  mailing  list, which includes all the core committers, who will be able to help
       assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate  the  release  of  patches  to
       mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address
       for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
