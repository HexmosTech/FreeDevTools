</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       replaygain - single file Replay Gain editor

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>replaygain</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>AUDIO_FILE</u> [<u>AUDIO_FILE</u> ...]
       <b>replaygain</b> --help
       <b>replaygain</b> --version

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>replaygain</b>  applies  or  displays Replay Gain information for audio files. By default, all given files be
       assumed to be part of a single album and album gain data will be calculated for them.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--version</b>
              Display the version of the software.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Display a short documentation.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--force</b>
              Recalculate Replay Gain even if the file already contains gain information.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--dry-run</b>
              Don't actually modify any files.

       <b>-r</b> <u>REF</u>, <b>--reference-loudness=</b><u>REF</u>
              Set the reference loudness to REF dB (default: 89 dB)

       <b>--mp3-format=</b><u>MP3_FORMAT</u>
              Choose the Replay Gain data format for MP3 files. The default setting should  be  compatible  with
              most  decent  software  music players, so it is generally not necessary to mess with this setting.
              See below for more information.

       <b>--no-album</b>
              Don't write any album gain information.

       <b>--show</b> Don't calculate anything, simply show Replay Gain information for the  specified  files.  In  this
              mode, all options other than <b>--mp3-format</b> are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>MP3</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       Proper  Replay  Gain  support  for  MP3  files  is a bit of a mess: on the one hand, there is the <b>mp3gain</b>
       application [1] which was relatively widely used (I don't know if it still is) --  it  directly  modifies
       the  audio  data which has the advantage that it works with pretty much any player, but it also means you
       have to decide ahead of time whether you want track gain or album  gain.  Besides,  it's  just  not  very
       elegant.  On  the  other  hand,  there  are  at  least two commonly used ways to store proper Replay Gain
       information in ID3v2 tags [2].

       Now, in general you don't have to worry about this when using this package: by  default,  <b>replaygain</b>  and
       <b>collectiongain</b>  will  read  and  write  Replay  Gain  information  in the two most commonly used formats.
       However, if for whatever reason you need more control over the MP3 Replay Gain information, you  can  use
       the  <b>--mp3-format</b> option (supported by both programs) to change the behaviour. Possible choices with this
       switch are:

          • <u>replaygain.org</u> (alias: <u>fb2k</u>) Replay Gain information is stored in ID3v2 TXXX frames. This format  is
            specified  on  the  replaygain.org  website  as  the recommended format for MP3 files. Notably, this
            format is also used by the foobar2000 music player for Windows [3].

          • <u>legacy</u> (alias: <u>ql</u>) Replay Gain information  is  stored  in  ID3v2.4  RVA2  frames.  This  format  is
            described  as  "legacy"  by replaygain.org; however, it is still the primary format for at least the
            Quod Libet music player [4] and possibly others. It should  be  noted  that  this  format  does  not
            support  volume  adjustments of more than 64 dB: if the calculated gain value is smaller than -64 dB
            or greater than or equal to +64 dB, it is clamped to these limit values.

          • <u>default</u> This is the default implementation used by both <b>replaygain</b> and <b>collectiongain</b>. When  writing
            Replay  Gain data, both the <u>replaygain.org</u> as well as the <u>legacy</u> format are written. As for reading,
            if a file contains data in both formats, both data sets are read and then compared.  If  they  match
            up,  that Replay Gain information is returned for the file.  However, if they don't match, no Replay
            Gain data is returned to signal that this file does not contain valid (read: consistent) Replay Gain
            information.
