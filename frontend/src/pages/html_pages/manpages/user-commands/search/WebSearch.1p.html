</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       WebSearch - a web-searching application demonstrating WWW::Search

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>WebSearch</b> <b>[-m</b> <b>MaxCount]</b> <b>[-e</b> <b>SearchEngine]</b> <b>[-o</b> <b>option]</b> <b>[-o</b> <b>option...]</b> <b>[-ardvV]</b> <b>query</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program is provides a command-line interface to web search engines, listing all URLs found for a
       given query.  This program also provides a simple demonstration of the WWW::Search Perl library for web
       searches.

       The program supports a number of search engines; use WebSearch --list to see which backends are
       installed.

       A more sophisticated client is AutoSearch which maintains a change list of found objects.

       For examples and hints about searches, see AutoSearch.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       WebSearch uses Getopt::Long, so you can use double-minus with long option names, or single-minus with
       one-letter abbreviations.

       --engine e_name, -e e_name
               The  string  e_name  is  the  name of (the module for) the desired search engine.  Capitalization
               matters.  See `perldoc WWW::Search` to find out what the default is (probably Null).

               Use --list to get a list of installed backends.

       --gui, -g
               Perform the search to mimic the default browser-based search.  Not implemented for all  backends,
               see the documentation for each backend.

       --list  Prints to STDERR a \n-separated list of installed backends.

       --max max_count, -m max_count
               Specify the maximum number of hits to retrieve.

       --option o_string, -o o_string
               Specify  a  search-engine option in the form 'key=value' (or just 'key').  Can be repeated for as
               many options are needed.  Keys can be repeated.

       --count, -c
               As the first line of output, print the approximate hit count.  As the last line of output,  print
               the actual hit count.

       --terse, -t
               Do  not print any URLs.  Only useful if you also specify --count.  If you specify --terse but not
               --count, there will be no output no matter how many hits are found!

       --all, -a
               For each hit result, print all the URLs that the search engine indicated were equivalent  to  it.
               (Some  URLs  may  refer to the same object.)  Can be combined with --verbose; can not be combined
               with --raw.

       --raw, -r
               For each hit result, print the raw HTML.  Not implemented for all backends.

       --verbose, -v
               Verbose mode.  Enumerate the returned URLs and show the description, score, date, etc. for each.

       --VERSION, -V
               Print version information and exit immediately.

       --debug &lt;i&gt;, -d &lt;i&gt;
               Display back-end debugging information (with debug level &lt;i&gt;)

       --host &lt;hostname.sub.domain&gt;
               Set the _host option for the WWW::Search object (backend-dependent).

       --port &lt;i&gt;
               Set the _port option for the WWW::Search object (backend-dependent).

       --username &lt;bbunny&gt;
               Set the username with which to login to the backend.

       --password &lt;c4rr0t5&gt;
               Set the password with which to login to the backend.

       --lwpdebug, -l
               Display low-level libwww-perl debugging information

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The environment variable <u>http_proxy</u> (or <u>HTTP_PROXY</u>) specifies a proxy, if any.
