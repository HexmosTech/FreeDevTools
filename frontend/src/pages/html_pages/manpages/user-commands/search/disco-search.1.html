</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       disco-search - search, edit and update DiscoDOS releases and tracks

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>disco</b>  <u>search</u> [<b>--help</b>] [<b>--mix</b> | <b>--discogs-update</b> | <b>--brainz-update</b> | <b>--edit</b>] [<b>--track</b>] [<b>--pos</b>] [<b>--resume</b>]
             <u>search_terms</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       the <b>search</b> command searches for releases and tracks in the Discogs collection.  Several  actions  can  be
       executed on the found items, eg. adding to a mix, updating track info from Discogs or fetching additional
       information  from  MusicBrainz/AcousticBrainz  or  simply  adding track information by hand (user-defined
       BPM/key, track notes, user-defined AcousticBrainz recording ID).

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>search_terms</u>
               The collection is searched for these terms. When  offline,  it  searches  through  all  releases'
               artists/titles  only  (eg tracknames not considered).  When online, the Discogs API search engine
               is used and also tracknames, artists, labels and catalog numbers  are  looked  through.  If  your
               search  term  consists of multiple words, put them inside double quotes (eg.  "foo bar term"). If
               you instead put a number as your search term, it is assumed you want to view exactly the  Discogs
               release with the given ID. If search term is the special keyword "all", a list of all releases in
               the  DiscoBASE is shown (including weblinks to Discogs/MusicBrainz release pages). In combination
               with <b>-u,</b> <b>-z</b> or <b>-zz</b> respectively, all tracks are updated. Note that this is exactely the same as "
               disco import " in combination with those options.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
               show this help message and exit

       <b>-m</b> <u>MIX_NAME</u>, <b>--mix</b> <u>MIX_NAME</u>
               adds a track of the found release to the given mix ID (asks which track to  add  in  case  <b>-t</b>  is
               missing).

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--discogs-update</b>
               updates found release/track with Discogs track/artist details (asks which track to update in case
               <b>-t</b> is missing).

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--brainz-update</b>
               updates found release/track with additional info from MusicBrainz and AcousticBrainz. (asks which
               track to update in case <b>-t</b> is missing) <b>-z</b> quick match, <b>-zz</b> detailed match (takes longer, but more
               results).

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--edit</b>
               edits/adds  details to a found release/track. Editable fields: key, BPM, key notes, general track
               notes, custom MusicBrainz recording ID. (asks which track to edit in case <b>-t</b> is missing).

       <b>-t</b> <u>TRACK_NUMBER</u>, <b>--track</b> <u>TRACK_NUMBER</u>
               in combination with <b>-m</b> this option adds the given track number (eg. A1, AA, B2, ...) to  the  mix
               selected using .Fl m ; in combination with <b>-z</b> or <b>-u</b> the given track is the one being updated with
               *Brainz or Discogs details; in combination with <b>-e</b> the given track is to one to be edited.

       <b>-p</b> <u>POS_IN_MIX</u>, <b>--pos</b> <u>POS_IN_MIX</u>
               in  combination  with  <b>-m</b>  this  option  states  that  we'd like to insert the track at the given
               position (eg. 1, 14, ...), rather than at the end of the mix; in combination with <b>-z,</b> <b>-zz,</b> <b>-u</b>  or
               <b>-e</b> this option is ignored.

       <b>--resume</b> <u>OFFSET</u>
               resumes  long-running  processes at the given offset position (expects a number). You can combine
               this option currently with *Brainz matching operations only ( <b>-z,</b> <b>-zz</b> )
