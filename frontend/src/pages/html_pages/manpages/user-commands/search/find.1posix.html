</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       find — find files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       find <b>[</b>-H|-L<b>]</b> <u>path</u>... <b>[</b><u>operand_expression</u>...<b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>find</u>  utility  shall  recursively  descend the directory hierarchy from each file specified by <u>path</u>,
       evaluating a Boolean expression composed of the primaries described in the OPERANDS section for each file
       encountered. Each <u>path</u> operand shall be evaluated unaltered as it was provided,  including  all  trailing
       &lt;slash&gt;  characters;  all  pathnames  for  other  files encountered in the hierarchy shall consist of the
       concatenation of the current <u>path</u> operand, a &lt;slash&gt; if the current <u>path</u> operand did not end in one,  and
       the  filename  relative  to  the  <u>path</u>  operand.  The  relative  portion  shall contain no dot or dot-dot
       components, no  trailing  &lt;slash&gt;  characters,  and  only  single  &lt;slash&gt;  characters  between  pathname
       components.

       The  <u>find</u> utility shall be able to descend to arbitrary depths in a file hierarchy and shall not fail due
       to path length limitations (unless a  <u>path</u>  operand  specified  by  the  application  exceeds  {PATH_MAX}
       requirements).

       The <u>find</u> utility shall detect infinite loops; that is, entering a previously visited directory that is an
       ancestor  of  the last file encountered.  When it detects an infinite loop, <u>find</u> shall write a diagnostic
       message to standard error and shall either recover its position in the hierarchy or terminate.

       If a file is removed from or added to the directory hierarchy being searched it is unspecified whether or
       not <u>find</u> includes that file in its search.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>find</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>12.2</u>,  <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The following options shall be supported by the implementation:

       <b>-H</b>        Cause the file information and file type evaluated for each symbolic link encountered as a <u>path</u>
                 operand  on  the  command line to be those of the file referenced by the link, and not the link
                 itself. If the referenced file does not exist, the file information and type shall be  for  the
                 link itself. File information and type for symbolic links encountered during the traversal of a
                 file hierarchy shall be that of the link itself.

       <b>-L</b>        Cause the file information and file type evaluated for each symbolic link encountered as a <u>path</u>
                 operand on the command line or encountered during the traversal of a file hierarchy to be those
                 of  the  file  referenced by the link, and not the link itself. If the referenced file does not
                 exist, the file information and type shall be for the link itself.

       Specifying more than one of the mutually-exclusive options <b>-H</b> and <b>-L</b> shall not be  considered  an  error.
       The  last  option  specified  shall  determine  the behavior of the utility. If neither the <b>-H</b> nor the <b>-L</b>
       option is specified, then the file information and type for symbolic links encountered as a <u>path</u>  operand
       on  the  command  line  or encountered during the traversal of a file hierarchy shall be that of the link
       itself.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       The first operand and subsequent operands up to but not including the first operand that  starts  with  a
       <b>'-'</b>,  or  is  a  <b>'!'</b>  or a <b>'('</b>, shall be interpreted as <u>path</u> operands. If the first operand starts with a
       <b>'-'</b>, or is a <b>'!'</b>  or a <b>'('</b>, the behavior is unspecified. Each <u>path</u> operand is a pathname  of  a  starting
       point in the file hierarchy.

       The  first  operand  that starts with a <b>'-'</b>, or is a <b>'!'</b>  or a <b>'('</b>, and all subsequent arguments shall be
       interpreted as an <u>expression</u> made up of the following  primaries  and  operators.  In  the  descriptions,
       wherever  <u>n</u>  is  used  as  a  primary  argument,  it shall be interpreted as a decimal integer optionally
       preceded by a &lt;plus-sign&gt; (<b>'+'</b>) or &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; (<b>'-'</b>), as follows:

       +<u>n</u>        More than <u>n</u>.

       <u>n</u>         Exactly <u>n</u>.

       -<u>n</u>        Less than <u>n</u>.

       The following primaries shall be supported:

       <b>-name</b> <u>pattern</u>
                 The primary shall evaluate as true if the basename of  the  current  pathname  matches  <u>pattern</u>
                 using  the pattern matching notation described in <u>Section</u> <u>2.13</u>, <u>Pattern</u> <u>Matching</u> <u>Notation</u>.  The
                 additional rules in <u>Section</u> <u>2.13.3</u>, <u>Patterns</u> <u>Used</u> <u>for</u> <u>Filename</u> <u>Expansion</u> do not apply  as  this
                 is a matching operation, not an expansion.

       <b>-path</b> <u>pattern</u>
                 The  primary  shall  evaluate as true if the current pathname matches <u>pattern</u> using the pattern
                 matching notation described in <u>Section</u> <u>2.13</u>, <u>Pattern</u> <u>Matching</u> <u>Notation</u>.  The  additional  rules
                 in  <u>Section</u>  <u>2.13.3</u>,  <u>Patterns</u>  <u>Used</u>  <u>for</u> <u>Filename</u> <u>Expansion</u> do not apply as this is a matching
                 operation, not an expansion.

       <b>-nouser</b>   The primary shall evaluate as true if the file belongs to a user ID for  which  the  <u>getpwuid</u>()
                 function defined in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 (or equivalent) returns NULL.

       <b>-nogroup</b>  The  primary  shall evaluate as true if the file belongs to a group ID for which the <u>getgrgid</u>()
                 function defined in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 (or equivalent) returns NULL.

       <b>-xdev</b>     The primary shall always evaluate as true; it shall cause <u>find</u> not to continue descending  past
                 directories  that  have  a  different device ID (<u>st_dev</u>, see the <u>stat</u>() function defined in the
                 System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017). If any <b>-xdev</b> primary is specified, it shall apply to
                 the entire expression even if the <b>-xdev</b> primary would not normally be evaluated.

       <b>-prune</b>    The primary shall always evaluate as true; it shall cause  <u>find</u>  not  to  descend  the  current
                 pathname  if  it  is  a directory. If the <b>-depth</b> primary is specified, the <b>-prune</b> primary shall
                 have no effect.

       <b>-perm</b> <b>[-]</b><u>mode</u>
                 The <u>mode</u> argument is used to represent file mode bits. It shall be identical in format  to  the
                 <u>symbolic_mode</u>  operand  described  in  <u>chmod</u>,  and shall be interpreted as follows. To start, a
                 template shall be assumed with all file mode bits cleared. An <u>op</u> symbol of <b>'+'</b>  shall  set  the
                 appropriate  mode bits in the template; <b>'-'</b> shall clear the appropriate bits; <b>'='</b> shall set the
                 appropriate mode bits, without regard to the contents of the file mode  creation  mask  of  the
                 process. The <u>op</u> symbol of <b>'-'</b> cannot be the first character of <u>mode</u>; this avoids ambiguity with
                 the optional leading &lt;hyphen-minus&gt;.  Since the initial mode is all bits off, there are not any
                 symbolic modes that need to use <b>'-'</b> as the first character.

                 If  the  &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; is omitted, the primary shall evaluate as true when the file permission
                 bits exactly match the value of the resulting template.

                 Otherwise, if <u>mode</u> is prefixed by a &lt;hyphen-minus&gt;, the primary shall evaluate as  true  if  at
                 least all the bits in the resulting template are set in the file permission bits.

       <b>-perm</b> <b>[-]</b><u>onum</u>
                 If  the  &lt;hyphen-minus&gt;  is omitted, the primary shall evaluate as true when the file mode bits
                 exactly match the value of the octal number <u>onum</u> (see the description  of  the  octal  <u>mode</u>  in
                 <u>chmod</u>).  Otherwise, if <u>onum</u> is prefixed by a &lt;hyphen-minus&gt;, the primary shall evaluate as true
                 if  at  least  all  of  the  bits  specified  in  <u>onum</u>  are set. In both cases, the behavior is
                 unspecified when <u>onum</u> exceeds 07777.

       <b>-type</b> <u>c</u>   The primary shall evaluate as true if the type of the file is <u>c</u>, where <u>c</u> is <b>'b'</b>, <b>'c'</b>, <b>'d'</b>, <b>'l'</b>,
                 <b>'p'</b>, <b>'f'</b>, or <b>'s'</b> for block special file, character  special  file,  directory,  symbolic  link,
                 FIFO, regular file, or socket, respectively.

       <b>-links</b> <u>n</u>  The primary shall evaluate as true if the file has <u>n</u> links.

       <b>-user</b> <u>uname</u>
                 The  primary  shall  evaluate  as  true  if  the file belongs to the user <u>uname.</u>  If <u>uname</u> is a
                 decimal integer and the <u>getpwnam</u>() (or equivalent) function does not return a valid user  name,
                 <u>uname</u> shall be interpreted as a user ID.

       <b>-group</b> <u>gname</u>
                 The  primary  shall  evaluate  as  true  if the file belongs to the group <u>gname</u>.  If <u>gname</u> is a
                 decimal integer and the <u>getgrnam</u>() (or equivalent) function does not return a valid group name,
                 <u>gname</u> shall be interpreted as a group ID.

       <b>-size</b> <u>n</u><b>[c]</b>
                 The primary shall evaluate as true if the file size in bytes, divided by 512 and rounded up  to
                 the next integer, is <u>n</u>.  If <u>n</u> is followed by the character <b>'c'</b>, the size shall be in bytes.

       <b>-atime</b> <u>n</u>  The  primary  shall evaluate as true if the file access time subtracted from the initialization
                 time, divided by 86400 (with any remainder discarded), is <u>n</u>.

       <b>-ctime</b> <u>n</u>  The primary shall evaluate as true if the time  of  last  change  of  file  status  information
                 subtracted from the initialization time, divided by 86400 (with any remainder discarded), is <u>n</u>.

       <b>-mtime</b> <u>n</u>  The  primary  shall  evaluate  as  true  if  the  file  modification  time  subtracted from the
                 initialization time, divided by 86400 (with any remainder discarded), is <u>n</u>.

       <b>-exec</b> <u>utility_name</u> <b>[</b><u>argument</u> ...<b>]</b> <b>;</b>

       <b>-exec</b> <u>utility_name</u> <b>[</b><u>argument</u> ...<b>]</b>  {} +
                 The end of the primary expression shall be punctuated by a &lt;semicolon&gt;  or  by  a  &lt;plus-sign&gt;.
                 Only a &lt;plus-sign&gt; that immediately follows an argument containing only the two characters <b>"{}"</b>
                 shall  punctuate  the end of the primary expression. Other uses of the &lt;plus-sign&gt; shall not be
                 treated as special.

                 If the primary expression is punctuated by a &lt;semicolon&gt;, the  utility  <u>utility_name</u>  shall  be
                 invoked  once for each pathname and the primary shall evaluate as true if the utility returns a
                 zero value as exit status. A <u>utility_name</u> or <u>argument</u> containing only the two  characters  <b>"{}"</b>
                 shall  be  replaced  by the current pathname. If a <u>utility_name</u> or <u>argument</u> string contains the
                 two characters <b>"{}"</b>, but not just the two characters <b>"{}"</b>, it is implementation-defined whether
                 <u>find</u> replaces those two characters or uses the string without change.

                 If the primary expression is punctuated by a &lt;plus-sign&gt;, the primary shall always evaluate  as
                 true,  and  the pathnames for which the primary is evaluated shall be aggregated into sets. The
                 utility <u>utility_name</u> shall  be  invoked  once  for  each  set  of  aggregated  pathnames.  Each
                 invocation shall begin after the last pathname in the set is aggregated, and shall be completed
                 before  the  <u>find</u>  utility  exits  and  before  the  first pathname in the next set (if any) is
                 aggregated for this primary, but it is otherwise  unspecified  whether  the  invocation  occurs
                 before,  during,  or after the evaluations of other primaries. If any invocation returns a non-
                 zero value as exit status, the <u>find</u> utility shall return a non-zero exit  status.  An  argument
                 containing  only  the two characters <b>"{}"</b> shall be replaced by the set of aggregated pathnames,
                 with each pathname passed as a separate argument to the invoked utility in the same order  that
                 it  was  aggregated.  The  size  of any set of two or more pathnames shall be limited such that
                 execution of the utility does not cause the system's {ARG_MAX} limit to be  exceeded.  If  more
                 than one argument containing the two characters <b>"{}"</b> is present, the behavior is unspecified.

                 The  current  directory  for  the  invocation  of <u>utility_name</u> shall be the same as the current
                 directory when the <u>find</u> utility was started. If the  <u>utility_name</u>  names  any  of  the  special
                 built-in utilities (see <u>Section</u> <u>2.14</u>, <u>Special</u> <u>Built-In</u> <u>Utilities</u>), the results are undefined.

       <b>-ok</b> <u>utility_name</u> <b>[</b><u>argument</u> ...<b>]</b> <b>;</b>
                 The <b>-ok</b> primary shall be equivalent to <b>-exec</b>, except that the use of a &lt;plus-sign&gt; to punctuate
                 the  end of the primary expression need not be supported, and <u>find</u> shall request affirmation of
                 the invocation of <u>utility_name</u> using the current file as an argument  by  writing  to  standard
                 error as described in the STDERR section. If the response on standard input is affirmative, the
                 utility  shall be invoked. Otherwise, the command shall not be invoked and the value of the <b>-ok</b>
                 operand shall be false.

       <b>-print</b>    The primary shall always evaluate as true; it shall cause the current pathname to be written to
                 standard output.

       <b>-newer</b> <u>file</u>
                 The primary shall evaluate as true if the modification time of the current file is more  recent
                 than the modification time of the file named by the pathname <u>file</u>.

       <b>-depth</b>    The primary shall always evaluate as true; it shall cause descent of the directory hierarchy to
                 be  done  so  that  all  entries  in a directory are acted on before the directory itself. If a
                 <b>-depth</b> primary is not specified, all entries in  a  directory  shall  be  acted  on  after  the
                 directory  itself.  If any <b>-depth</b> primary is specified, it shall apply to the entire expression
                 even if the <b>-depth</b> primary would not normally be evaluated.

       The primaries can be combined using the following operators (in order of decreasing precedence):

       ( <u>expression</u> )
                 True if <u>expression</u> is true.

       <b>!</b> <u>expression</u>
                 Negation of a primary; the unary NOT operator.

       <u>expression</u> <b>[-a]</b> <u>expression</u>
                 Conjunction of primaries; the AND operator is implied by the juxtaposition of two primaries  or
                 made  explicit by the optional <b>-a</b> operator. The second expression shall not be evaluated if the
                 first expression is false.

       <u>expression</u> <b>-o</b> <u>expression</u>
                 Alternation of primaries; the OR operator. The second expression shall not be evaluated if  the
                 first expression is true.

       If  no  <u>expression</u> is present, <b>-print</b> shall be used as the expression. Otherwise, if the given expression
       does not contain any of the primaries <b>-exec</b>, <b>-ok</b>, or <b>-print</b>, the given expression  shall  be  effectively
       replaced by:

           ( <u>given_expression</u> ) -print

       The <b>-user</b>, <b>-group</b>, and <b>-newer</b> primaries each shall evaluate their respective arguments only once.

       When the file type evaluated for the current file is a symbolic link, the results of evaluating the <b>-perm</b>
       primary are implementation-defined.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       If  the <b>-ok</b> primary is used, the response shall be read from the standard input.  An entire line shall be
       read as the response. Otherwise, the standard input shall not be used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>find</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u>  <u>Variables</u>  for  the
                 precedence   of   internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values  of  locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the  other  internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_COLLATE</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  for  the  behavior  of ranges, equivalence classes, and multi-character
                 collating elements used in the pattern matching notation for the <b>-n</b> option and in the  extended
                 regular expression defined for the <b>yesexpr</b> locale keyword in the <u>LC_MESSAGES</u> category.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  This  variable  determines the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data
                 as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments),  the
                 behavior  of character classes within the pattern matching notation used for the <b>-n</b> option, and
                 the behavior of character classes within regular  expressions  used  in  the  extended  regular
                 expression defined for the <b>yesexpr</b> locale keyword in the <u>LC_MESSAGES</u> category.

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine  the  locale used to process affirmative responses, and the locale used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages and prompts written to standard error.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

       <u>PATH</u>      Determine the location of the <u>utility_name</u> for the <b>-exec</b> and <b>-ok</b> primaries, as described in the
                 Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Chapter</u> <u>8</u>, <u>Environment</u> <u>Variables</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>-print</b> primary shall cause the current pathnames to be written to standard output. The  format  shall
       be:

           "%s\n", &lt;<u>path</u>&gt;

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>-ok</b> primary shall write a prompt to standard error containing at least the <u>utility_name</u> to be invoked
       and  the  current  pathname.  In  the POSIX locale, the last non-&lt;blank&gt; in the prompt shall be <b>'?'</b>.  The
       exact format used is unspecified.

       Otherwise, the standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    All <u>path</u> operands were traversed successfully.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       When  used  in  operands,  pattern  matching  notation,  &lt;semicolon&gt;,  &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;,  and   &lt;right-
       parenthesis&gt; characters are special to the shell and must be quoted (see <u>Section</u> <u>2.2</u>, <u>Quoting</u>).

       The  bit  that  is  traditionally  used for sticky (historically 01000) is specified in the <b>-perm</b> primary
       using the octal number argument form. Since this bit is not  defined  by  this  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,
       applications must not assume that it actually refers to the traditional sticky bit.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
        1. The following commands are equivalent:

               find .
               find . -print

           They both write out the entire directory hierarchy from the current directory.

        2. The following command:

               find / \( -name tmp -o -name '*.xx' \) -atime +7 -exec rm {} \;

           removes  all  files  named <b>tmp</b> or ending in <b>.xx</b> that have not been accessed for seven or more 24-hour
           periods.

        3. The following command:

               find . -perm -o+w,+s

           prints (<b>-print</b> is assumed) the names of all files in or below the current directory, with all of  the
           file permission bits S_ISUID, S_ISGID, and S_IWOTH set.

        4. The following command:

               find . -name SCCS -prune -o -print

           recursively  prints  pathnames of all files in the current directory and below, but skips directories
           named SCCS and files in them.

        5. The following command:

               find . -print -name SCCS -prune

           behaves as in the previous example, but prints the names of the SCCS directories.

        6. The following command is roughly equivalent to the <b>-nt</b> extension to <u>test</u>:

               if [ -n "$(find file1 -prune -newer file2)" ]; then
                   printf %s\\n "file1 is newer than file2"
               fi

        7. The descriptions of <b>-atime</b>, <b>-ctime</b>, and <b>-mtime</b> use the terminology <u>n</u> ``86400 second periods (days)''.
           For example, a file accessed at 23:59 is selected by:

               find . -atime -1 -print

           at 00:01 the next day (less than 24 hours later, not more than one day ago);  the  midnight  boundary
           between days has no effect on the 24-hour calculation.

        8. The following command:

               find . ! -name . -prune -name '*.old' -exec \
                   sh -c 'mv "$@" ../old/' sh {} +

           performs the same task as:

               mv ./*.old ./.old .<a href="file:/.">/.</a>*.old ../old/

           while  avoiding  an ``Argument list too long'' error if there are a large number of files ending with
           <b>.old</b> and without running <u>mv</u> if there are no such files (and avoiding ``No such  file  or  directory''
           errors if <b>./.old</b> does not exist or no files match <b>./*.old</b> or <b>.<a href="file:/.">/.</a>*.old</b>).

           The alternative:

               find . ! -name . -prune -name '*.old' -exec mv {} ../old/ \;

           is less efficient if there are many files to move because it executes one <u>mv</u> command per file.

        9. On  systems  configured  to  mount removable media on directories under <b><a href="file:/media">/media</a></b>, the following command
           searches the file hierarchy for files larger than 100000 KB without searching any  mounted  removable
           media:

               find / -path <a href="file:/media">/media</a> -prune -o -size +200000 -print

       10. Except  for  the  root  directory,  and <b>"//"</b> on implementations where <b>"//"</b> does not refer to the root
           directory, no pattern given to <b>-name</b> will match a &lt;slash&gt;, because trailing  &lt;slash&gt;  characters  are
           ignored  when  computing the basename of the file under evaluation. Given two empty directories named
           <b>foo</b> and <b>bar</b>, the following command:

               find foo/// bar/// -name foo -o -name 'bar?*'

           prints only the line <b>"foo///"</b>.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>-a</b> operator was retained as an optional operator for compatibility  with  historical  shell  scripts,
       even though it is redundant with expression concatenation.

       The  descriptions  of  the  <b>'-'</b>  modifier  on the <u>mode</u> and <u>onum</u> arguments to the <b>-perm</b> primary agree with
       historical practice on BSD and System V implementations. System V and BSD documentation both describe  it
       in  terms of checking additional bits; in fact, it uses the same bits, but checks for having at least all
       of the matching bits set instead of having exactly the matching bits set.

       The exact format of the interactive prompts is unspecified. Only the general nature of  the  contents  of
       prompts are specified because:

        *  Implementations may desire more descriptive prompts than those used on historical implementations.

        *  Since  the historical prompt strings do not terminate with &lt;newline&gt; characters, there is no portable
           way for another program to interact with the prompts of this utility via pipes.

       Therefore, an application using this prompting option relies on the system to provide the  most  suitable
       dialog directly with the user, based on the general guidelines specified.

       The  <b>-name</b> <u>file</u> operand was changed to use the shell pattern matching notation so that <u>find</u> is consistent
       with other utilities using pattern matching.

       The <b>-size</b> operand refers to the size of a file, rather than the number of blocks it  may  occupy  in  the
       file system. The intent is that the <u>st_size</u> field defined in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017
       should be used, not the <u>st_blocks</u> found in historical implementations. There are at least two reasons for
       this:

        1. In  both  System V and BSD, <u>find</u> only uses <u>st_size</u> in size calculations for the operands specified by
           this volume of POSIX.1‐2017. (BSD uses <u>st_blocks</u> only when processing the <b>-ls</b> primary.)

        2. Users usually think of file size in terms of bytes, which is also the unit used by the <u>ls</u> utility for
           the output from the <b>-l</b> option. (In both System V and BSD, <u>ls</u> uses <u>st_size</u>  for  the  <b>-l</b>  option  size
           field  and uses <u>st_blocks</u> for the <u>ls</u> <b>-s</b> calculations. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not specify <u>ls</u>
           <b>-s</b>.)

       The descriptions of <b>-atime</b>, <b>-ctime</b>, and <b>-mtime</b> were changed from the SVID description of <u>n</u> ``days'' to  <u>n</u>
       being  the  result of the integer division of the time difference in seconds by 86400. The description is
       also different in terms of the exact timeframe for the <u>n</u> case (<u>versus</u> the <u>+n</u> or <u>-n</u>), but it  matches  all
       known historical implementations. It refers to one 86400 second period in the past, not any time from the
       beginning  of that period to the current time. For example, <b>-atime</b> 2 is true if the file was accessed any
       time in the period from 72 hours to 48 hours ago.

       Historical implementations do not modify <b>"{}"</b> when  it  appears  as  a  substring  of  an  <b>-exec</b>  or  <b>-ok</b>
       <u>utility_name</u>  or  argument  string.  There  have  been numerous user requests for this extension, so this
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 allows the desired behavior. At least one recent implementation does support  this
       feature,  but  encountered  several  problems  in  managing  memory  allocation and dealing with multiple
       occurrences of <b>"{}"</b> in a string while it was being developed, so it is not yet required behavior.

       Assuming the presence of <b>-print</b> was added to correct a historical pitfall that plagues novice  users,  it
       is  entirely  upwards-compatible  from  the  historical System V <u>find</u> utility. In its simplest form (<u>find</u>
       <u>directory</u>), it could be confused with the historical BSD fast  <u>find</u>.   The  BSD  developers  agreed  that
       adding <b>-print</b> as a default expression was the correct decision and have added the fast <u>find</u> functionality
       within a new utility called <u>locate</u>.

       Historically,  the <b>-L</b> option was implemented using the primary <b>-follow</b>.  The <b>-H</b> and <b>-L</b> options were added
       for two reasons. First, they offer a finer granularity of control and  consistency  with  other  programs
       that  walk  file  hierarchies.  Second,  the  <b>-follow</b>  primary  always  evaluated  to  true. As they were
       historically really global variables that took effect before the traversal began, some valid  expressions
       had  unexpected results. An example is the expression <b>-print</b> <b>-o</b> <b>-follow</b>.  Because <b>-print</b> always evaluates
       to true, the standard order of evaluation implies that <b>-follow</b> would never be evaluated. This  was  never
       the  case.  Historical practice for the <b>-follow</b> primary, however, is not consistent. Some implementations
       always follow symbolic links on the command line whether <b>-follow</b>  is  specified  or  not.  Others  follow
       symbolic  links  on  the command line only if <b>-follow</b> is specified. Both behaviors are provided by the <b>-H</b>
       and <b>-L</b> options, but scripts using the current <b>-follow</b> primary would be broken if the  <b>-follow</b>  option  is
       specified to work either way.

       Since  the  <b>-L</b> option resolves all symbolic links and the <b>-type</b> <u>l</u> primary is true for symbolic links that
       still exist after symbolic links have been resolved, the command:

           find -L . -type l

       prints a list of symbolic links reachable from the current directory that do not  resolve  to  accessible
       files.

       A  feature of SVR4's <u>find</u> utility was the <b>-exec</b> primary's <b>+</b> terminator. This allowed filenames containing
       special characters (especially &lt;newline&gt; characters) to be grouped together  without  the  problems  that
       occur  if  such  filenames are piped to <u>xargs</u>.  Other implementations have added other ways to get around
       this problem, notably a <b>-print0</b> primary that wrote filenames  with  a  null  byte  terminator.  This  was
       considered  here,  but  not  adopted.  Using  a  null terminator meant that any utility that was going to
       process <u>find</u>'s <b>-print0</b> output had to add a new option to parse the  null  terminators  it  would  now  be
       reading.

       The <b>"-exec</b>...<b>{}</b>+" syntax adopted was a result of IEEE PASC Interpretation 1003.2 #210. It should be noted
       that  this  is an incompatible change to IEEE Std 1003.2‐1992. For example, the following command printed
       all files with a <b>'-'</b> after their name if they are regular files, and a <b>'+'</b> otherwise:

           find / -type f -exec echo {} - ';' -o -exec echo {} + ';'

       The change invalidates usage like this. Even though the previous standard stated that  this  usage  would
       work,  in  practice  many did not support it and the standard developers felt it better to now state that
       this was not allowable.
