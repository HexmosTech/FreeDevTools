</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>r.texture</u> creates raster maps with textural features from a user-specified raster map layer.  The  module
       calculates textural features based on spatial dependence matrices at 0, 45, 90, and 135 degrees.

       In  order  to  take  into  account  the scale of the texture to be measured, <u>r.texture</u> allows the user to
       define the <u>size</u> of the moving window and the <u>distance</u> at which to compare pixel grey values.  By  default
       the  module  averages  the  results  over the 4 orientations, but the user can also request output of the
       texture variables in 4 different orientations (flag <u>-s</u>). Please note that angles are defined  in  degrees
       of  east  and  they  increase counterclockwise, so 0 is East - West, 45 is North-East - South-West, 90 is
       North - South, 135 is North-West - South-East.

       The user can either chose one or several texture measures (see below for  their  description)  using  the
       <u>method</u> parameter, or can request the creating of maps for all available methods with the <u>-a</u>.

       <u>r.texture</u>  assumes  grey levels ranging from 0 to 255 as input.  The input is automatically rescaled to 0
       to 255 if the input map range is outside of this range.  In order to reduce noise in the input data (thus
       generally reinforcing the textural features), and to speed up processing, it is recommended that the user
       recode the data using equal-probability quantization.  Quantization rules for <u>r.recode</u> can  be  generated
       with <u>r.quantile</u> <u>-r</u> using e.g 16 or 32 quantiles (see example below).

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Texture  is  a feature of specific land cover classes in satellite imagery.  It is particularly useful in
       situations where spectral differences between classes are small, but classes are distinguishable by their
       organisation on the ground, often opposing natural to human-made spaces: cultivated fields vs meadows  or
       golf  courses,  palm tree plantations vs natural rain forest, but texture can also be a natural phenomen:
       dune fields, different canopies due to different tree species. The  usefulness  and  use  of  texture  is
       highly dependent on the resolution of satellite imagery and on the scale of the human intervention or the
       phenomenon  that created the texture (also see the discussion of scale dependency below). The user should
       observe the phenomenon visually in order to determine an adequat setting of the <u>size</u> parameter.

       The output of <u>r.texture</u> can constitute very useful additional variables as input for image classification
       or image segmentation (object recognition).  It can be used in supervised classification algorithms  such
       as i.maxlik or i.smap, or for the identification of objects in i.segment, and/or for the characterization
       of these objects and thus, for example, as one of the raster inputs of the i.segment.stats addon.

       In  general,  several variables constitute texture: differences in grey level values, coarseness as scale
       of grey level differences, presence or lack of directionality and regular  patterns.  A  texture  can  be
       characterized  by  tone  (grey  level  intensity properties) and structure (spatial relationships). Since
       textures are highly scale dependent, hierarchical textures may occur.

       <u>r.texture</u> uses the common texture model based  on  the  so-called  grey  level  co-occurrence  matrix  as
       described  by Haralick et al (1973). This matrix is a two-dimensional histogram of grey levels for a pair
       of pixels which are separated by  a  fixed  spatial  relationship.  The  matrix  approximates  the  joint
       probability  distribution  of  a  pair of pixels. Several texture measures are directly computed from the
       Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM).  The provided measures can be categorized under  first-order  and
       second-order  statistics,  with  each  playing  a unique role in texture analysis. First-order statistics
       consider the distribution of individual pixel values  without  regard  to  spatial  relationships,  while
       second-order  statistics,  particularly  those  derived  from the Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM),
       consider the spatial relationship of pixels.

       The following part offers brief explanations of the Haralick et al texture measures (after Jensen 1996).

   <b>First-order</b> <b>statistics</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>spatial</b> <b>domain</b>
           •   Sum Average (SA): Sum Average measures the average gray level intensity of the sum of pixel pairs
               within the moving window. It reflects the average intensity of pixel pairs at specific  distances
               and orientations, highlighting the overall brightness level within the area.

           •   Entropy  (ENT):  This  measure  analyses the randomness. It is high when the values of the moving
               window have similar values. It is low when the values are close to either 0 or 1 (i.e.  when  the
               pixels in the local window are uniform).

           •   Difference  Entropy  (DE):  This  metric  quantifies  the  randomness  or unpredictability in the
               distribution of differences between the grey levels of pixel  pairs.  It  is  a  measure  of  the
               entropy of the pixel-pair difference histogram, capturing texture granularity.

           •   Sum  Entropy  (SE):  Similar  to  Difference  Entropy,  Sum  Entropy  measures  the randomness or
               unpredictability, but in the context of the sum of the grey levels of pixel pairs.  It  evaluates
               the  entropy of the pixel-pair sum distribution, providing insight into the complexity of texture
               in terms of intensity variation.

           •   Variance (VAR): A measure of gray tone variance within the  moving  window  (second-order  moment
               about the mean)

           •   Difference  Variance (DV): This is a measure of the variance or spread of the differences in grey
               levels between pairs of pixels within the moving window. It quantifies the  contrast  variability
               between pixels, indicating texture smoothness or roughness.

           •   Sum  Variance (SV): In contrast to Difference Variance, Sum Variance measures the variance of the
               sum of grey levels of pixel pairs. It assesses the variability in the intensity levels  of  pairs
               of pixels, contributing to an understanding of texture brightness or intensity variation.
       Note  that  measures  "mean",  "kurtosis", "range", "skewness", and "standard deviation" are available in
       <u>r.neighbors</u>.

   <b>Second-order</b> <b>statistics</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>spatial</b> <b>domain</b>
       The second-order statistics texture model is based on the so-called  grey  level  co-occurrence  matrices
       (GLCM; after Haralick 1979).

           •   Angular  Second  Moment (ASM, also called Uniformity): This is a measure of local homogeneity and
               the opposite of Entropy.  High values of ASM occur when the pixels in the moving window are  very
               similar.
               Note: The square root of the ASM is sometimes used as a texture measure, and is called Energy.

           •   Inverse  Difference  Moment (IDM, also called Homogeneity): This measure relates inversely to the
               contrast measure. It is a direct measure of the local homogeneity of a digital image. Low  values
               are associated with low homogeneity and vice versa.

           •   Contrast  (CON):  This measure analyses the image contrast (locally gray-level variations) as the
               linear dependency of grey levels of neighboring pixels (similarity).  Typically  high,  when  the
               scale of local texture is larger than the <u>distance</u>.

           •   Correlation  (COR):  This  measure   analyses the linear dependency of grey levels of neighboring
               pixels. Typically high, when the scale of local texture is larger than the <u>distance</u>.

           •   Information Measures of Correlation (MOC): These measures evaluate the complexity of the  texture
               in  terms  of the mutual dependence between the grey levels of pixel pairs. They quantify how one
               pixel value informs or correlates with another, offering insight into pattern predictability  and
               structure regularity.

           •   Maximal  Correlation  Coefficient  (MCC): This statistic measures the highest correlation between
               any two features of the texture, providing a single value that summarizes the  degree  of  linear
               dependency  between grey levels in the texture. It’s often used to assess the overall correlation
               in the image, indicating how predictable the texture patterns are from one pixel to the next.

       The computational region should be set to the input map with <b>g.region</b> <b>raster=&lt;input</b> <b>map&gt;</b>, or  aligned  to
       the input map with <b>g.region</b> <b>align=&lt;input</b> <b>map&gt;</b> if only a subregion should be analyzed.

       Note  that the output of <u>r.texture</u> will always be smaller than the current region as only cells for which
       there are no null cells and for which all cells of the moving window are within the current  region  will
       contain a value. The output will thus appear cropped at the margins.

       Importantly, the input raster map cannot have more than 255 categories.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Calculation of Angular Second Moment of B/W orthophoto (North Carolina data set):
       g.region raster=ortho_2001_t792_1m -p
       # set grey level color table 0% black 100% white
       r.colors ortho_2001_t792_1m color=grey
       # extract grey levels
       r.mapcalc "ortho_2001_t792_1m.greylevel = ortho_2001_t792_1m"
       # texture analysis
       r.texture ortho_2001_t792_1m.greylevel output=ortho_texture method=asm -s
       # display
       g.region n=221461 s=221094 w=638279 e=638694
       d.shade color=ortho_texture_ASM_0 shade=ortho_2001_t792_1m
       This   calculates   four   maps   (requested   texture   at   four   orientations):  ortho_texture_ASM_0,
       ortho_texture_ASM_45, ortho_texture_ASM_90, ortho_texture_ASM_135.  Reducing the number  of  gray  levels
       (equal-probability quantizing):
       g.region -p raster=ortho_2001_t792_1m
       # enter as one line or with \
       r.quantile input=ortho_2001_t792_1m quantiles=16 -r | r.recode \
                  input=ortho_2001_t792_1m output=ortho_2001_t792_1m_q16 rules=-
       The recoded raster map can then be used as input for <u>r.texture</u> as before.

       Second example: analysis of IDM (homogeneity) on a simple raster with North-South line pattern.
       # import raster
       r.in.ascii in=- output=lines &lt;&lt; EOF
       north: 9
       south: 0
       east: 9
       west: 0
       rows: 9
       cols: 9
       0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
       0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
       0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
       0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
       0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
       0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
       0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
       0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
       0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
       EOF
       # adjust region to raster
       g.region raster=lines
       # calculate IDM (homogeneity) in all directions
       r.texture -s lines method=idm output=text_lines

       The  following  image  shows  the  original  map,  the  result  in  East-West direction and the result in
       North-South direction, showing how texture can depend on direction, with  texture  perfectly  homogeneous
       (value=1)  in the North-South direction, but quite heterogeneous in East-West direction, except for those
       areas where there are three columns of equal values (as size=3).  The overlaid grid highlights  that  the
       texture measures output maps are cropped at the margins.

       The program can run incredibly slow for large raster maps and large moving windows (<u>size</u> option).
