</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ps - report a snapshot of the current processes.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ps</b> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ps</b> displays information about a selection of the active processes.  If you want a repetitive update of
       the selection and the displayed information, use <b>top</b> instead.

       This version of <b>ps</b> accepts several kinds of options:

       1   UNIX options, which may be grouped and must be preceded by a dash.
       2   BSD options, which may be grouped and must not be used with a dash.
       3   GNU long options, which are preceded by two dashes.

       Options  of  different  types  may  be freely mixed, but conflicts can appear.  There are some synonymous
       options, which are functionally identical, due to the many standards and <b>ps</b> implementations that this  <b>ps</b>
       is compatible with.

       Note  that  <b>ps</b> <b>-aux</b> is distinct from <b>ps</b> <b>aux</b>.  The POSIX and UNIX standards require that <b>ps</b> <b>-aux</b> print all
       processes owned by a user named <u>x</u>, as well as printing all processes that would be  selected  by  the  <b>-a</b>
       option.   If  the  user  named  <u>x</u> does not exist, this <b>ps</b> may interpret the command as <b>ps</b> <b>aux</b> instead and
       print a warning.  This behavior is intended to aid in  transitioning  old  scripts  and  habits.   It  is
       fragile, subject to change, and thus should not be relied upon.

       By  default, <b>ps</b> selects all processes with the same effective user ID (euid=EUID) as the current user and
       associated with the same terminal as the invoker.  It displays the process  ID  (pid=PID),  the  terminal
       associated  with the process (tname=TTY), the cumulated CPU time in [DD-]hh:mm:ss format (time=TIME), and
       the executable name (ucmd=CMD).  Output is unsorted by default.

       The use of BSD-style options will add process state (stat=STAT) to  the  default  display  and  show  the
       command  args  (args=COMMAND)  instead  of the executable name.  You can override this with the <b>PS_FORMAT</b>
       environment variable.  The use of BSD-style options will also change the  process  selection  to  include
       processes  on other terminals (TTYs) that are owned by you; alternately, this may be described as setting
       the selection to be the set of all processes filtered to exclude processes owned by other users or not on
       a terminal.  These effects are not considered when options are described as being "identical"  below,  so
       <b>-M</b> will be considered identical to <b>Z</b> and so on.

       Except  as  described below, process selection options are additive.  The default selection is discarded,
       and then the selected processes are added to the set of processes to be displayed.  A process  will  thus
       be shown if it meets any of the given selection criteria.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To see every process on the system using standard syntax:
          <b>ps</b> <b>-e</b>
          <b>ps</b> <b>-ef</b>
          <b>ps</b> <b>-eF</b>
          <b>ps</b> <b>-ely</b>

       To see every process on the system using BSD syntax:
          <b>ps</b> <b>ax</b>
          <b>ps</b> <b>axu</b>

       To print a process tree:
          <b>ps</b> <b>-ejH</b>
          <b>ps</b> <b>axjf</b>

       To get info about threads:
          <b>ps</b> <b>-eLf</b>
          <b>ps</b> <b>axms</b>

       To get security info:
          <b>ps</b> <b>-eo</b> <b>euser,ruser,suser,fuser,f,comm,label</b>

          <b>ps</b> <b>-U</b> <b>root</b> <b>-u</b> <b>root</b> <b>u</b>

       To see every process with a user-defined format:
          <b>ps</b> <b>-eo</b> <b>pid,tid,class,rtprio,ni,pri,psr,pcpu,stat,wchan:14,comm</b>
          <b>ps</b> <b>axo</b> <b>stat,euid,ruid,tty,tpgid,sess,pgrp,ppid,pid,pcpu,comm</b>
          <b>ps</b> <b>-Ao</b> <b>pid,tt,user,fname,tmout,f,wchan</b>

       Print only the process IDs of syslogd:
          <b>ps</b> <b>-C</b> <b>syslogd</b> <b>-o</b> <b>pid=</b>

       Print only the name of PID 42:
          <b>ps</b> <b>-q</b> <b>42</b> <b>-o</b> <b>comm=</b>

</pre><h4><b>SIMPLE</b> <b>PROCESS</b> <b>SELECTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>a</b>      Lift  the  BSD-style  "only  yourself" restriction, which is imposed upon the set of all processes
              when some BSD-style (without "-") options are used or when the <b>ps</b> personality setting is BSD-like.
              The set of processes selected in this manner is in addition to the set of  processes  selected  by
              other  means.  An alternate description is that this option causes <b>ps</b> to list all processes with a
              terminal (tty), or to list all processes when used together with the <b>x</b> option.

       <b>-A</b>     Select all processes.  Identical to <b>-e</b>.

       <b>-a</b>     Select all processes except both session leaders (see <u><a href="../man2/getsid.2.html">getsid</a></u>(2)) and processes not associated with
              a terminal.

       <b>-d</b>     Select all processes except session leaders.

       <b>--deselect</b>
              Select all processes except those that fulfill the specified conditions (negates  the  selection).
              Identical to <b>-N</b>.

       <b>-e</b>     Select all processes.  Identical to <b>-A</b>.

       <b>g</b>      Really  all,  even  session  leaders.   This  flag is obsolete and may be discontinued in a future
              release.  It is normally implied by the <b>a</b> flag, and is only useful when operating  in  the  sunos4
              personality.

       <b>-N</b>     Select  all  processes except those that fulfill the specified conditions (negates the selection).
              Identical to <b>--deselect</b>.

       <b>T</b>      Select all processes associated with this  terminal.   Identical  to  the  <b>t</b>  option  without  any
              argument.

       <b>r</b>      Restrict the selection to only running processes.

       <b>x</b>      Lift  the  BSD-style "must have a tty" restriction, which is imposed upon the set of all processes
              when some BSD-style (without "-") options are used or when the <b>ps</b> personality setting is BSD-like.
              The set of processes selected in this manner is in addition to the set of  processes  selected  by
              other  means.   An alternate description is that this option causes <b>ps</b> to list all processes owned
              by you (same EUID as <b>ps</b>), or to list all processes when used together with the <b>a</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>PROCESS</b> <b>SELECTION</b> <b>BY</b> <b>LIST</b></h4><pre>
       These options accept a single argument in the form of a blank-separated or  comma-separated  list.   They
       can be used multiple times.  For example: <b>ps</b> <b>-p</b> <b>"1</b> <b>2"</b> <b>-p</b> <b>3,4</b>

       -<u>123</u>   Identical to <b>--pid</b> <u>123</u>.

       <u>123</u>    Identical to <b>--pid</b> <u>123</u>.

       <b>-C</b> <u>cmdlist</u>
              Select  by  command  name.   This selects the processes whose executable name is given in <u>cmdlist</u>.
              NOTE: The command name is not the same as the command line. Previous versions of  procps  and  the
              kernel truncated this command name to 15 characters. This limitation is no longer present in both.
              If you depended on matching only 15 characters, you may no longer get a match.

       <b>-G</b> <u>grplist</u>
              Select by real group ID (RGID) or name.  This selects the processes whose real group name or ID is
              in  the <u>grplist</u> list.  The real group ID identifies the group of the user who created the process,
              see <u><a href="../man2/getgid.2.html">getgid</a></u>(2).

       <b>-g</b> <u>grplist</u>
              Select by session OR by  effective  group  name.   Selection  by  session  is  specified  by  many
              standards,  but  selection by effective group is the logical behavior that several other operating
              systems use.  This <b>ps</b> will select by session when the list  is  completely  numeric  (as  sessions
              are).   Group  ID numbers will work only when some group names are also specified.  See the <b>-s</b> and
              <b>--group</b> options.

       <b>--Group</b> <u>grplist</u>
              Select by real group ID (RGID) or name.  Identical to <b>-G</b>.

       <b>--group</b> <u>grplist</u>
              Select by effective group ID (EGID) or name.  This selects the  processes  whose  effective  group
              name  or  ID  is  in  <u>grplist</u>.   The  effective  group  ID  describes  the group whose file access
              permissions are used by the process (see <u><a href="../man2/getegid.2.html">getegid</a></u>(2)).  The <b>-g</b> option is often  an  alternative  to
              <b>--group</b>.

       <b>p</b> <u>pidlist</u>
              Select by process ID.  Identical to <b>-p</b> and <b>--pid</b>.

       <b>-p</b> <u>pidlist</u>
              Select  by PID.  This selects the processes whose process ID numbers appear in <u>pidlist</u>.  Identical
              to <b>p</b> and <b>--pid</b>.

       <b>--pid</b> <u>pidlist</u>
              Select by process ID.  Identical to <b>-p</b> and <b>p</b>.

       <b>--ppid</b> <u>pidlist</u>
              Select by parent process ID.  This selects the processes with  a  parent  process ID  in  <u>pidlist</u>.
              That is, it selects processes that are children of those listed in <u>pidlist</u>.

       <b>q</b> <u>pidlist</u>
              Select by process ID (quick mode).  Identical to <b>-q</b> and <b>--quick-pid</b>.

       <b>-q</b> <u>pidlist</u>
              Select  by  PID  (quick  mode).   This  selects  the  processes whose process ID numbers appear in
              <u>pidlist</u>.  With this option <b>ps</b> reads the necessary info only for the pids listed in the <u>pidlist</u> and
              doesn't apply additional filtering rules.  The order  of  pids  is  unsorted  and  preserved.   No
              additional  selection  options,  sorting  and  forest  type  listings  are  allowed  in this mode.
              Identical to <b>q</b> and <b>--quick-pid</b>.

       <b>--quick-pid</b> <u>pidlist</u>
              Select by process ID (quick mode).  Identical to <b>-q</b> and <b>q</b>.

       <b>-s</b> <u>sesslist</u>
              Select by session ID.  This selects the processes with a session ID specified in <u>sesslist</u>.

       <b>--sid</b> <u>sesslist</u>
              Select by session ID.  Identical to <b>-s</b>.

       <b>t</b> <u>ttylist</u>
              Select by tty.  Nearly identical to <b>-t</b> and <b>--tty</b>, but can also be used with an  empty  <u>ttylist</u>  to
              indicate  the  terminal associated with <b>ps</b>.  Using the <b>T</b> option is considered cleaner than using <b>t</b>
              with an empty <u>ttylist</u>.

       <b>-t</b> <u>ttylist</u>
              Select by tty.  This selects the  processes  associated  with  the  terminals  given  in  <u>ttylist</u>.
              Terminals (ttys, or screens for text output) can be specified in several forms: /dev/ttyS1, ttyS1,
              S1.  A plain "-" may be used to select processes not attached to any terminal.

       <b>--tty</b> <u>ttylist</u>
              Select by terminal.  Identical to <b>-t</b> and <b>t</b>.

       <b>U</b> <u>userlist</u>
              Select  by effective user ID (EUID) or name.  This selects the processes whose effective user name
              or ID is in <u>userlist</u>.  The effective user ID describes the user whose file access permissions  are
              used by the process (see <u><a href="../man2/geteuid.2.html">geteuid</a></u>(2)).  Identical to <b>-u</b> and <b>--user</b>.

       <b>-U</b> <u>userlist</u>
              Select  by real user ID (RUID) or name.  It selects the processes whose real user name or ID is in
              the <u>userlist</u> list.  The real user ID identifies the user who created the process, see <u><a href="../man2/getuid.2.html">getuid</a></u>(2).

       <b>-u</b> <u>userlist</u>
              Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.  This selects the processes whose effective user  name
              or ID is in <u>userlist</u>.

              The  effective  user  ID  describes the user whose file access permissions are used by the process
              (see <u><a href="../man2/geteuid.2.html">geteuid</a></u>(2)).  Identical to <b>U</b> and <b>--user</b>.

       <b>--User</b> <u>userlist</u>
              Select by real user ID (RUID) or name.  Identical to <b>-U</b>.

       <b>--user</b> <u>userlist</u>
              Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.  Identical to <b>-u</b> and <b>U</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FORMAT</b> <b>CONTROL</b></h4><pre>
       These options are used to choose the information displayed by <b>ps</b>.  The output may differ by personality.

       <b>-c</b>     Show different scheduler information for the <b>-l</b> option.

       <b>--context</b>
              Display security context format (for SELinux).

       <b>-f</b>     Do full-format listing.  This option can be combined with many other  UNIX-style  options  to  add
              additional  columns.   It also causes the command arguments to be printed.  When used with <b>-L</b>, the
              NLWP (number of threads) and LWP (thread ID) columns will be added.  See the <b>c</b> option, the  format
              keyword <b>args</b>, and the format keyword <b>comm</b>.

       <b>-F</b>     Extra full format.  See the <b>-f</b> option, which <b>-F</b> implies.

       <b>--format</b> <u>format</u>
              user-defined format.  Identical to <b>-o</b> and <b>o</b>.

       <b>j</b>      BSD job control format.

       <b>-j</b>     Jobs format.

       <b>l</b>      Display BSD long format.

       <b>-l</b>     Long format.  The <b>-y</b> option is often useful with this.

       <b>-M</b>     Add a column of security data.  Identical to <b>Z</b> (for SELinux).

       <b>O</b> <u>format</u>
              is  preloaded  <b>o</b>  (overloaded).  The BSD <b>O</b> option can act like <b>-O</b> (user-defined output format with
              some common fields predefined) or can be used to specify  sort  order.   Heuristics  are  used  to
              determine  the  behavior of this option.  To ensure that the desired behavior is obtained (sorting
              or formatting), specify the option in some other way (e.g.  with <b>-O</b> or <b>--sort</b>).  When  used  as  a
              formatting option, it is identical to <b>-O</b>, with the BSD personality.

       <b>-O</b> <u>format</u>
              Like  <b>-o</b>,  but  preloaded with some default columns.  Identical to <b>-o</b> <b>pid,</b><u>format</u><b>,state,tname,time,</b>
              <b>command</b> or <b>-o</b> <b>pid,</b><u>format</u><b>,tname,time,cmd</b>, see <b>-o</b> below.

       <b>o</b> <u>format</u>
              Specify user-defined format.  Identical to <b>-o</b> and <b>--format</b>.

       <b>-o</b> <u>format</u>
              User-defined  format.   <u>format</u>  is  a  single  argument  in  the  form  of  a  blank-separated  or
              comma-separated  list,  which  offers  a way to specify individual output columns.  The recognized
              keywords are described in the <b>STANDARD</b> <b>FORMAT</b> <b>SPECIFIERS</b> section below.  Headers  may  be  renamed
              (<b>ps</b>  <b>-o</b>  <b>pid,ruser=RealUser</b>  <b>-o</b>  <b>comm=Command</b>) as desired.  If all column headers are empty (<b>ps</b> <b>-o</b>
              <b>pid=</b> <b>-o</b> <b>comm=</b>) then the header line will not be output.  Column width will increase as needed  for
              wide  headers;  this  may  be  used to widen up columns such as WCHAN (<b>ps</b> <b>-o</b> <b>pid,wchan=WIDE-WCHAN-</b>
              <b>COLUMN</b> <b>-o</b> <b>comm</b>).  Explicit width control (<b>ps</b> <b>opid,wchan:42,cmd</b>) is offered too.  The  behavior  of
              <b>ps</b>  <b>-o</b>  <b>pid=X,comm=Y</b>  varies  with  personality;  output may be one column named "X,comm=Y" or two
              columns named "X" and "Y".  Use multiple <b>-o</b> options when in doubt.  Use the <b>PS_FORMAT</b>  environment
              variable to specify a default as desired; DefSysV and DefBSD are macros that may be used to choose
              the default UNIX or BSD columns.

       <b>s</b>      Display signal format.

       <b>u</b>      Display user-oriented format.

       <b>v</b>      Display virtual memory format.

       <b>X</b>      Register format.

       <b>-y</b>     Do not show flags; show rss in place of addr.  This option can only be used with <b>-l</b>.

       <b>Z</b>      Add a column of security data.  Identical to <b>-M</b> (for SELinux).

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>MODIFIERS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>c</b>      Show  the  true  command  name.  This is derived from the name of the executable file, rather than
              from the argv value.  Command arguments and any modifications to them are thus  not  shown.   This
              option  effectively  turns the <b>args</b> format keyword into the <b>comm</b> format keyword; it is useful with
              the <b>-f</b> format option and with the various BSD-style format options, which all normally display the
              command arguments.  See the <b>-f</b> option, the format keyword <b>args</b>, and the format keyword <b>comm</b>.

       <b>--cols</b> <u>n</u>
              Set screen width.

       <b>--columns</b> <u>n</u>
              Set screen width.

       <b>--cumulative</b>
              Include some dead child process data (as a sum with the parent).

       <b>e</b>      Show the environment after the command.

       <b>f</b>      ASCII art process hierarchy (forest).

       <b>--forest</b>
              ASCII art process tree.

       <b>h</b>      No header.  (or, one header per screen in the BSD personality).   The  <b>h</b>  option  is  problematic.
              Standard BSD <b>ps</b> uses this option to print a header on each page of output, but older Linux <b>ps</b> uses
              this  option  to  totally  disable  the header.  This version of <b>ps</b> follows the Linux usage of not
              printing the header unless the BSD personality has been selected, in which case it prints a header
              on each page of output.  Regardless of the current personality,  you  can  use  the  long  options
              <b>--headers</b>  and  <b>--no-headers</b>  to  enable  printing  headers each page or disable headers entirely,
              respectively.

       <b>-H</b>     Show process hierarchy (forest).

       <b>--headers</b>
              Repeat header lines, one per page of output.

       <b>k</b> <u>spec</u> Specify sorting order.  Sorting syntax is [<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>]<u>key</u>[,[<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>]<u>key</u>[,...]].  Choose  a  multi-letter  key
              from  the  <b>STANDARD</b>  <b>FORMAT</b>  <b>SPECIFIERS</b>  section.   The "+" is optional since default direction is
              increasing numerical or lexicographic order.  Identical to <b>--sort</b>.

                      Examples:
                      <b>ps</b> <b>jaxkuid,-ppid,+pid</b>
                      <b>ps</b> <b>axk</b> <b>comm</b> <b>o</b> <b>comm,args</b>
                      <b>ps</b> <b>kstart_time</b> <b>-ef</b>

       <b>--lines</b> <u>n</u>
              Set screen height.

       <b>n</b>      Numeric output for WCHAN and USER (including all types of UID and GID).

       <b>--no-headers</b>
              Print no header line at all.  <b>--no-heading</b> is an alias for this option.

       <b>O</b> <u>order</u>
              Sorting order (overloaded).  The BSD <b>O</b> option can act like <b>-O</b>  (user-defined  output  format  with
              some  common  fields  predefined)  or  can  be used to specify sort order.  Heuristics are used to
              determine the behavior of this option.  To ensure that the desired behavior is  obtained  (sorting
              or formatting), specify the option in some other way (e.g.  with <b>-O</b> or <b>--sort</b>).

              For  sorting,  obsolete  BSD <b>O</b> option syntax is <b>O</b>[<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>]<u>k1</u>[,[<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>]<u>k2</u>[,...]].  It orders the processes
              listing according to the multilevel sort specified by the sequence of one-letter short keys <u>k1</u>,<u>k2</u>,
              ... described in the <b>OBSOLETE</b> <b>SORT</b> <b>KEYS</b> section below.   The "+"  is  currently  optional,  merely
              re-iterating  the  default  direction  on  a  key, but may help to distinguish an <b>O</b> sort from an <b>O</b>
              format.  The "-" reverses direction only on the key it precedes.

       <b>--rows</b> <u>n</u>
              Set screen height.

       <b>S</b>      Sum up some information, such as CPU usage, from dead child processes into their parent.  This  is
              useful  for examining a system where a parent process repeatedly forks off short-lived children to
              do work.

       <b>--sort</b> <u>spec</u>
              Specify sorting order.  Sorting syntax is [<u>+</u>|<u>-</u>]<u>key</u>[,[<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>]<u>key</u>[,...]].  Choose  a  multi-letter  key
              from  the  <b>STANDARD</b>  <b>FORMAT</b>  <b>SPECIFIERS</b>  section.   The "+" is optional since default direction is
              increasing numerical or lexicographic order.  Identical to <b>k</b>.  For  example:  <b>ps</b>  <b>jax</b>  <b>--sort=uid,</b>
              <b>-ppid,+pid</b>

       <b>w</b>      Wide output.  Use this option twice for unlimited width.

       <b>-w</b>     Wide output.  Use this option twice for unlimited width.

       <b>--width</b> <u>n</u>
              Set screen width.

</pre><h4><b>THREAD</b> <b>DISPLAY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>H</b>      Show threads as if they were processes.

       <b>-L</b>     Show threads, possibly with LWP and NLWP columns.

       <b>m</b>      Show threads after processes.

       <b>-m</b>     Show threads after processes.

       <b>-T</b>     Show threads, possibly with SPID column.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>INFORMATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--help</b> <u>section</u>
              Print  a help message.  The <u>section</u> argument can be one of <u>s</u>imple, <u>l</u>ist, <u>o</u>utput, <u>t</u>hreads, <u>m</u>isc, or
              <u>a</u>ll.  The argument can be shortened to one of the underlined letters as in: s|l|o|t|m|a.

       <b>--info</b> Print debugging info.

       <b>L</b>      List all format specifiers.

       <b>V</b>      Print the procps-ng version.

       <b>-V</b>     Print the procps-ng version.

       <b>--version</b>
              Print the procps-ng version.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       This <b>ps</b> works by reading the virtual files in /proc.  This <b>ps</b> does not need to be setuid kmem or have any
       privileges to run.  Do not give this <b>ps</b> any special permissions.

       CPU usage is currently expressed as the percentage of time spent running during the entire lifetime of  a
       process.  This is not ideal, and it does not conform to the standards that <b>ps</b> otherwise conforms to.  CPU
       usage is unlikely to add up to exactly 100%.

       The  SIZE  and  RSS  fields  don't count some parts of a process including the page tables, kernel stack,
       struct thread_info, and struct task_struct.  This is usually at least 20 KiB of  memory  that  is  always
       resident.  SIZE is the virtual size of the process (code+data+stack).

       Processes  marked &lt;defunct&gt; are dead processes (so-called "zombies") that remain because their parent has
       not destroyed them properly.  These processes will be destroyed by <u><a href="../man8/init.8.html">init</a></u>(8) if the parent process exits.

       If the length of the username is greater than the length of the display  column,  the  username  will  be
       truncated.  See the <b>-o</b> and <b>-O</b> formatting options to customize length.

       Commands  options  such  as  <b>ps</b> <b>-aux</b> are not recommended as it is a confusion of two different standards.
       According to the POSIX and UNIX standards, the above command asks to display all  processes  with  a  TTY
       (generally  the  commands  users  are  running) plus all processes owned by a user named <u>x</u>.  If that user
       doesn't exist, then <b>ps</b> will assume you really meant <b>ps</b> <b>aux</b>.

</pre><h4><b>PROCESS</b> <b>FLAGS</b></h4><pre>
       The sum of these values is displayed in the "F" column, which is provided by the <b>flags</b> output specifier:

               1    forked but didn't exec
               4    used super-user privileges

</pre><h4><b>PROCESS</b> <b>STATE</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       Here are the different values that the <b>s</b>, <b>stat</b> and <b>state</b> output specifiers (header "STAT"  or  "S")  will
       display to describe the state of a process:

               D    uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
               I    Idle kernel thread
               R    running or runnable (on run queue)
               S    interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
               T    stopped by job control signal
               t    stopped by debugger during the tracing
               W    paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)
               X    dead (should never be seen)
               Z    defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent

       For BSD formats and when the <b>stat</b> keyword is used, additional characters may be displayed:

               &lt;    high-priority (not nice to other users)
               N    low-priority (nice to other users)
               L    has pages locked into memory (for real-time and custom IO)
               s    is a session leader
               l    is multi-threaded (using CLONE_THREAD, like NPTL pthreads do)
               +    is in the foreground process group

</pre><h4><b>OBSOLETE</b> <b>SORT</b> <b>KEYS</b></h4><pre>
       These keys are used by the BSD <b>O</b> option (when it is used for sorting).  The GNU <b>--sort</b> option doesn't use
       these  keys, but the specifiers described below in the <b>STANDARD</b> <b>FORMAT</b> <b>SPECIFIERS</b> section.  Note that the
       values used in sorting are the internal values <b>ps</b> uses and not the "cooked" values used in  some  of  the
       output  format  fields  (e.g.  sorting on tty will sort into device number, not according to the terminal
       name displayed).  Pipe <b>ps</b> output into the <b><a href="../man1/sort.1.html">sort</a></b>(1) command if you want to sort the cooked values.

</pre><h4><b>AIX</b> <b>FORMAT</b> <b>DESCRIPTORS</b></h4><pre>
       This <b>ps</b> supports AIX format descriptors, which work somewhat like the formatting codes of  <u><a href="../man1/printf.1.html">printf</a></u>(1)  and
       <u><a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a></u>(3).   For example, the normal default output can be produced with this: <b>ps</b> <b>-eo</b> <b>"%p</b> <b>%y</b> <b>%x</b> <b>%c"</b>.  The
       <b>NORMAL</b> codes are described in the next section.
       <b>CODE</b>   <b>NORMAL</b>   <b>HEADER</b>
       %C     pcpu     %CPU
       %G     group    GROUP

       %x     time     TIME
       %y     tty      TTY
       %z     vsz      VSZ

</pre><h4><b>STANDARD</b> <b>FORMAT</b> <b>SPECIFIERS</b></h4><pre>
       Here are the different keywords that may be used to control the output format (e.g., with option  <b>-o</b>)  or
       to sort the selected processes with the GNU-style <b>--sort</b> option.

       For example: <b>ps</b> <b>-eo</b> <b>pid,user,args</b> <b>--sort</b> <b>user</b>

       This version of <b>ps</b> tries to recognize most of the keywords used in other implementations of <b>ps</b>.

       The  following  user-defined format specifiers may contain spaces: <b>args</b>, <b>cmd</b>, <b>comm</b>, <b>command</b>, <b>fname</b>, <b>ucmd</b>,
       <b>ucomm</b>, <b>lstart</b>, <b>bsdstart</b>, <b>start</b>.

       Some keywords may not be available for sorting.

       <b>CODE</b>        <b>HEADER</b>    <b>DESCRIPTION</b>

       <b>%cpu</b>        %CPU      cpu utilization of the process in "##.#" format.  Currently, it  is  the  CPU  time
                             used  divided  by  the  time the process has been running (cputime/realtime ratio),
                             expressed as a percentage.  It will not add  up  to  100%  unless  you  are  lucky.
                             (alias <b>pcpu</b>).

       <b>%mem</b>        %MEM      ratio  of  the  process's resident set size  to the physical memory on the machine,
                             expressed as a percentage.  (alias <b>pmem</b>).

       <b>args</b>        COMMAND   command with all its arguments as a string.  Modifications to the arguments may  be
                             shown.   The  output in this column may contain spaces.  A process marked &lt;defunct&gt;
                             is partly dead, waiting to be fully destroyed by its parent.  Sometimes the process
                             args will be unavailable; when this happens, <b>ps</b> will instead print  the  executable
                             name  in brackets.  (alias <b>cmd</b>, <b>command</b>).  See also the <b>comm</b> format keyword, the <b>-f</b>
                             option, and the <b>c</b> option.
                             When specified last, this column will extend to the edge of the display.  If <b>ps</b> can
                             not determine display width, as when output is redirected (piped) into  a  file  or
                             another command, the output width is undefined (it may be 80, unlimited, determined
                             by  the  <b>TERM</b>  variable,  and  so  on).  The <b>COLUMNS</b> environment variable or <b>--cols</b>
                             option may be used to exactly determine the width in this case.  The <b>w</b> or <b>-w</b> option
                             may be also be used to adjust width.

       <b>blocked</b>     BLOCKED   mask of the blocked signals, see <u><a href="../man7/signal.7.html">signal</a></u>(7).  According to the width of the field, a
                             32 or 64-bit mask in hexadecimal format is displayed.  (alias <b>sig_block</b>, <b>sigmask</b>).

       <b>bsdstart</b>    START     time the command started.  If the process was started less than 24 hours  ago,  the
                             output  format is " HH:MM", else it is " Mmm:SS" (where Mmm is the three letters of
                             the month).  See also <b>lstart</b>, <b>start</b>, <b>start_time</b>, and <b>stime</b>.

       <b>bsdtime</b>     TIME      accumulated cpu time, user + system.  The display format is usually  "MMM:SS",  but
                             can be shifted to the right if the process used more than 999 minutes of cpu time.

       <b>c</b>           C         processor  utilization.   Currently, this is the integer value of the percent usage
                             over the lifetime of the process.  (see <b>%cpu</b>).

       <b>caught</b>      CAUGHT    mask of the caught signals, see <u><a href="../man7/signal.7.html">signal</a></u>(7).  According to the width of the field,  a
                             32  or  64  bits  mask  in  hexadecimal  format  is  displayed.   (alias <b>sig_catch</b>,
                             <b>sigcatch</b>).

       <b>cgname</b>      CGNAME    display name of control groups to which the process belongs.

       <b>cgroup</b>      CGROUP    display control groups to which the process belongs.

       <b>class</b>       CLS       scheduling class of the process.  (alias <b>policy</b>,  <b>cls</b>).   Field's  possible  values
                             are:

       <b>cmd</b>         CMD       see <b>args</b>.  (alias <b>args</b>, <b>command</b>).

       <b>comm</b>        COMMAND   command name (only the executable name).  Modifications to the  command  name  will
                             not  be  shown.   A  process  marked  &lt;defunct&gt; is partly dead, waiting to be fully
                             destroyed by its parent.  The output in this column  may  contain  spaces.   (alias
                             <b>ucmd</b>, <b>ucomm</b>).  See also the <b>args</b> format keyword, the <b>-f</b> option, and the <b>c</b> option.
                             When specified last, this column will extend to the edge of the display.  If <b>ps</b> can
                             not  determine  display  width, as when output is redirected (piped) into a file or
                             another command, the output width is undefined (it may be 80, unlimited, determined
                             by the <b>TERM</b> variable, and so on).   The  <b>COLUMNS</b>  environment  variable  or  <b>--cols</b>
                             option may be used to exactly determine the width in this case.  The <b>w</b> or <b>-w</b> option
                             may be also be used to adjust width.

       <b>command</b>     COMMAND   See <b>args</b>.  (alias <b>args</b>, <b>command</b>).

       <b>cp</b>          CP        per-mill (tenths of a percent) CPU usage.  (see <b>%cpu</b>).

       <b>cputime</b>     TIME      cumulative CPU time, "[DD-]hh:mm:ss" format.  (alias <b>time</b>).

       <b>cputimes</b>    TIME      cumulative CPU time in seconds (alias <b>times</b>).

       <b>drs</b>         DRS       data  resident  set  size,  the  amount  of  physical  memory devoted to other than

       <b>egid</b>        EGID      effective group ID number of the process as a decimal integer.  (alias <b>gid</b>).

       <b>egroup</b>      EGROUP    effective group ID of the process.  This will be the textual group ID, if it can be
                             obtained and the field  width  permits,  or  a  decimal  representation  otherwise.
                             (alias <b>group</b>).

       <b>eip</b>         EIP       instruction pointer.

       <b>esp</b>         ESP       stack pointer.

       <b>etime</b>       ELAPSED   elapsed time since the process was started, in the form [[DD-]hh:]mm:ss.

       <b>etimes</b>      ELAPSED   elapsed time since the process was started, in seconds.

       In  general,  it  is  a bad idea to set these variables.  The one exception is <b>CMD_ENV</b> or <b>PS_PERSONALITY</b>,
       which could be set to Linux for normal systems.  Without that setting, <b>ps</b> follows  the  useless  and  bad
       parts of the Unix98 standard.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ps</b>  was  originally written by Branko Lankester.  Michael K. Johnson re-wrote it significantly to use the
       proc filesystem, changing a few things in the  process.   Michael Shields  added  the  pid-list  feature.
       Charles Blake  added  multi-level  sorting,  the  dirent-style  library, the device name-to-number mmaped
       database, the approximate binary search directly on System.map, and many code and documentation cleanups.
       David Mossberger-Tang wrote the generic BFD support for psupdate.  Albert Cahalan  rewrote  ps  for  full
       Unix98 and BSD support, along with some ugly hacks for obsolete and foreign syntax.
