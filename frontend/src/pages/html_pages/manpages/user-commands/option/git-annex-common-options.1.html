</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       git-annex-common-options - options supported by many git-annex commands

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These  common  options are accepted by many git-annex commands, and may not be explicitly listed on their
       individual man pages.  Most of these options are accepted by all git-annex commands.  (Many commands also
       accept the <a href="../man1/git-annex-matching-options.1.html">git-annex-matching-options</a>(1).)

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--force</b>

              Force unsafe actions, such as dropping a file's content when no other source of it can be verified
              to still exist, or adding ignored files.  Use with care.

       <b>--fast</b> Avoid some expensive operations normally performed by a command.  What is avoided depends  on  the
              command, see individual command's man pages for details.

       <b>--quiet</b>
              Avoid the default verbose display of what is done; only show errors.

       <b>--verbose</b>
              Enable verbose display. On by default but can be disabled by --quiet.

       <b>--explain</b>
              Display  explanations  of  what  git-annex  takes  into  account  when  deciding  what  to do. The
              explanations will be inside square brackets.  For example, "[foo is not present here]"

              This includes explanations of why preferred content expressions and other similar expressions like
              annex.largefiles match or fail to match.  In these explanations, the expression is displayed, with
              each term followed by "[TRUE]" or "[FALSE]" to indicate  the  value.   Irrelevant  terms  will  be
              ommitted  from  the  explanation,  for  example  <b>"exclude=*</b>  <b>and</b>  <b>copies=1"</b>  will  be displayed as
              <b>"exclude=*[FALSE]"</b>

       <b>--debug</b>
              Display debug messages to standard error.

       <b>--no-debug</b>
              Disable display of debug messages.

       <b>--debugfilter=name[,name..]</b>
              When debug message display has been enabled by <b>--debug</b>, this filters the debug messages  that  are
              displayed to ones coming from modules with the specified names.

              To  find  the  names  of  modules,  see  the full debug output, which includes the module name, eg
              "(Utility.Process)"

              The full module name does not need to be specified when using this, a substring of the  name  will
              do.

              For  example,  <b>--debugfilter=Process,External</b>  will  display  debugging output when git-annex runs
              processes, and when it communicates with external special remotes.

       <b>--numcopies=n</b>
              Overrides the numcopies setting.

       <b>--mincopies=n</b>
              Overrides the mincopies setting.

       <b>--rebalance</b>
              Changes  the  behavior  of  the  "balanced"  preferred  content  expression  to  be  the  same  as
              "fullbalanced"  and the "sizebalanced" expression to be the same as "fullsizebalanced". When those
              expressions are used, this can cause a lot of work to be done to rebalance repositories.

       <b>--time-limit=time</b>
              Limits how long a git-annex command runs. The time can be something like "5h", or  "30m"  or  even
              "45s" or "10d".

              Note  that git-annex may continue running for some time past the specified time limit, in order to
              finish processing files it started before the time limit was reached. That and a cleaner  shutdown
              are the differences between using this option and a command like <b><a href="../man1/timeout.1.html">timeout</a>(1)</b>.

              When the time limit prevents git-annex from doing all it was asked to, it will exit with a special
              code, 101.

       <b>--size-limit=size</b>
              Limits the total size of annexed files that a git-annex command can process.

              The size can be specified with any commonly used units, for example, "50gb".

              In  some  cases,  an  annexed  file's  size  is not known. This option will prevent git-annex from
              processing such files.

              When the size limit prevents git-annex from acting on any files, it will exit with a special code,
              101.

       <b>--semitrust=repository</b>

       <b>--untrust=repository</b>
              Overrides trust settings for a repository. May be specified more than once.

              The repository should be specified using  the  name  of  a  configured  remote,  or  the  UUID  or
              description of a repository.

       <b>--trust=repository</b>
              This  used to override trust settings for a repository, but now will not do so, because trusting a
              repository can lead to data loss, and data loss is now only enabled when using the <b>--force</b> option.

       <b>--trust-glacier</b>
              This used to override trust settings for Glacier special remotes, but now will not do so,  because
              it could lead to data loss, and data loss is now only enabled when using the <b>--force</b> option.

       <b>--user-agent=value</b>
              Overrides  the  User-Agent  to use when downloading files from the web, or otherwise accessing web
              services.

       <b>--notify-finish</b>
              Caused a desktop notification to be displayed after each successful file download and upload.

              (Only supported on some platforms, e.g. Linux with dbus. A no-op when not supported.)

       <b>--notify-start</b>
              Caused a desktop notification to be displayed when a file upload or download has started, or  when
              a file is dropped.

       <b>-c</b> <b>name=value</b>
              Overrides git configuration settings. May be specified multiple times.
