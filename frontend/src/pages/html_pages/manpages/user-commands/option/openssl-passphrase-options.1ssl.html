       openssl-passphrase-options - Pass phrase options

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>openssl</b> <u>command</u> [ <u>options</u> ... ] [ <u>parameters</u> ... ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Several OpenSSL commands accept password arguments, typically using <b>-passin</b> and <b>-passout</b> for input and
       output passwords respectively. These allow the password to be obtained from a variety of sources. Both of
       these options take a single argument whose format is described below. If no password argument is given
       and a password is required then the user is prompted to enter one: this will typically be read from the
       current terminal with echoing turned off.

       Note that character encoding may be relevant, please see <b><a href="../man7/passphrase-encoding.7.html">passphrase-encoding</a></b>(7).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Pass</b> <b>Phrase</b> <b>Option</b> <b>Arguments</b>
       Pass phrase arguments can be formatted as follows.

       <b>pass:</b><u>password</u>
           The  actual  password  is <u>password</u>. Since the password is visible to utilities (like 'ps' under Unix)
           this form should only be used where security is not important.

       <b>env:</b><u>var</u>
           Obtain the password from the environment variable <u>var</u>. Since the environment of  other  processes  is
           visible  on  certain  platforms  (e.g.  ps  under  certain Unix OSes) this option should be used with
           caution.

       <b>file:</b><u>pathname</u>
           Reads the password from the specified file <u>pathname</u>, which can be a regular file,  device,  or  named
           pipe. Only the first line, up to the newline character, is read from the stream.

           If the same <u>pathname</u> argument is supplied to both <b>-passin</b> and <b>-passout</b> arguments, the first line will
           be used for the input password, and the next line will be used for the output password.

       <b>fd:</b><u>number</u>
           Reads  the  password from the file descriptor <u>number</u>. This can be useful for sending data via a pipe,
           for example. The same line handling as described for  <b>file:</b>  applies  to  passwords  read  from  file
           descriptors.

           <b>fd:</b> is not supported on Windows.

       <b>stdin</b>
           Reads  the  password  from  standard  input. The same line handling as described for <b>file:</b> applies to
           passwords read from standard input.
