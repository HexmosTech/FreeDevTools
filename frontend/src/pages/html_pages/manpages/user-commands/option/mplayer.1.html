</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mplayer</b> is a movie player for Linux (runs on many other platforms and CPU architectures, see the documen‐
       tation).  It plays most MPEG/VOB, AVI, ASF/WMA/WMV, RM, QT/MOV/MP4, Ogg/OGM, MKV, VIVO, FLI, NuppelVideo,
       yuv4mpeg,  FILM and RoQ files, supported by many native and binary codecs.  You can watch VCD, SVCD, DVD,
       Blu-ray, 3ivx, DivX 3/4/5, WMV and even H.264 movies, too.

       MPlayer supports a wide range of video and audio output drivers.  It works with X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL, SV‐
       GAlib, fbdev, AAlib, libcaca, DirectFB, Quartz, Mac OS X CoreVideo, but you can also use  GGI,  SDL  (and
       all  their drivers), VESA (on every VESA-compatible card, even without X11), some low-level card-specific
       drivers (for Matrox, 3dfx and ATI) and some hardware MPEG decoder boards, such as the Siemens DVB,  Haup‐
       pauge  PVR  (IVTV),  DXR2 and DXR3/Hollywood+.  Most of them support software or hardware scaling, so you
       can enjoy movies in fullscreen mode.

       MPlayer has an onscreen display (OSD) for status information, nice big antialiased shaded  subtitles  and
       visual  feedback  for keyboard controls.  European/ISO8859-1,2 (Hungarian, English, Czech, etc), Cyrillic
       and Korean fonts are supported along with 12 subtitle formats (MicroDVD, SubRip,  OGM,  SubViewer,  Sami,
       VPlayer,  RT,  SSA,  AQTitle, JACOsub, PJS and our own: MPsub) and DVD subtitles (SPU streams, VOBsub and
       Closed Captions).

       <b>mencoder</b> (MPlayer's Movie Encoder) is a simple movie encoder, designed to encode MPlayer-playable  movies
       (see  above) to other MPlayer-playable formats (see below).  It encodes to MPEG-4 (DivX/Xvid), one of the
       libavcodec codecs and PCM/MP3/VBRMP3 audio in 1, 2 or 3 passes.  Furthermore it has stream copying abili‐
       ties, a powerful filter system (crop, expand, flip, postprocess, rotate, scale,  noise,  RGB/YUV  conver‐
       sion) and more.

       <b>gmplayer</b>  is  MPlayer with a graphical user interface.  Besides some own options (stored in gui.conf), it
       has the same options as MPlayer, however some MPlayer options will be stored in gui.conf so that they can
       be chosen independently from MPlayer. (See GUI CONFIGURATION FILE below.)

       Usage examples to get you started quickly can be found at the end of this man page.

       <b>Also</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>HTML</b> <b>documentation!</b>

</pre><h4><b>INTERACTIVE</b> <b>CONTROL</b></h4><pre>
       MPlayer has a fully configurable, command-driven control layer which allows you to control MPlayer  using
       keyboard, mouse, joystick or remote control (with LIRC).  See the -input option for ways to customize it.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Every 'flag' option has a 'noflag' counterpart, e.g. the opposite of the -fs option is -nofs.

       If  an  option is marked as (XXX only), it will only work in combination with the XXX option or if XXX is
       compiled in.

       <u>NOTE:</u> The suboption parser (used for example for -ao pcm suboptions) supports a special kind  of  string-
       escaping intended for use with external GUIs.
       It has the following format:
       %n%string_of_length_n
       <u>EXAMPLES:</u>
       mplayer -ao pcm:file=%10%C:test.wav test.avi
       Or in a script:
       mplayer -ao pcm:file=%`expr length "$NAME"`%"$NAME" test.avi

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       You  can  put all of the options in configuration files which will be read every time MPlayer/MEncoder is
       run.  The system-wide configuration file 'mplayer.conf' is in your configuration  directory  (e.g.  <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a>
       mplayer or /usr/local/etc/mplayer), the user specific one is '<a href="file:~/.mplayer/config">~/.mplayer/config</a>'.  The configuration file
       for  MEncoder  is  'mencoder.conf'  in your configuration directory (e.g. /etc/mplayer or <a href="file:/usr/local/etc/">/usr/local/etc/</a>
       mplayer), the user specific one is '<a href="file:~/.mplayer/mencoder.conf">~/.mplayer/mencoder.conf</a>'.  User specific  options  override  system-
       wide  options (in case of <b>gmplayer</b>, gui.conf options override user specific options) and options given on
       the command line override all.  The syntax of the configuration files is 'option=&lt;value&gt;', everything af‐
       ter a '#' is considered a comment.  Options that work without values can be enabled by  setting  them  to
       'yes'  or  '1'  or 'true' and disabled by setting them to 'no' or '0' or 'false'.  Even suboptions can be
       specified in this way.

       You can also write file-specific configuration files.  If you wish to have a  configuration  file  for  a
       file  called  'movie.avi',  create a file named 'movie.avi.conf' with the file-specific options in it and
       put it in <a href="file:~/.mplayer/.">~/.mplayer/.</a>  You can also put the configuration file in the same directory as the file  to  be
       played,  as  long  as you give the -use-filedir-conf option (either on the command line or in your global
       config file).  If a file-specific configuration file is found in the  same  directory,  no  file-specific
       configuration  is  loaded  from <a href="file:~/.mplayer.">~/.mplayer.</a>  In addition, the -use-filedir-conf option enables directory-
       specific configuration files.  For this, MPlayer first tries to load a mplayer.conf from the same  direc‐
       tory as the file played and then tries to load any file-specific configuration.

</pre><h4><b>PROFILES</b></h4><pre>
       To ease working with different configurations profiles can be defined in the configuration files.  A pro‐
       file starts with its name between square brackets, e.g. '[my-profile]'.  All following  options  will  be
       part of the profile.  A description (shown by -profile help) can be defined with the profile-desc option.
       To end the profile, start another one or use the profile name 'default' to continue with normal options.

       <u>EXAMPLE</u> <u>MPLAYER</u> <u>PROFILE:</u>

       [protocol.dvd]
       profile-desc="profile for dvd:// streams"
       vf=pp=hb/vb/dr/al/fd

       nocache=yes

       [extension.flv]
       profile-desc="profile for .flv files"
       flip=yes

       [vo.pnm]
       outdir=<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>

       [ao.alsa]

       profile-desc="HQ MPEG4 encoding"
       profile=mpeg4
       lavcopts=mbd=2:trell=yes:v4mv=yes

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-codecpath</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
              Specify a directory for binary codecs.

       <b>-codecs-file</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>-afm,</b> <b>-ac,</b> <b>-vfm,</b> <b>-vc)</b>
              Override the standard search path and use the specified file instead of the builtin codecs.conf.

       <b>-include</b> <b>&lt;configuration</b> <b>file&gt;</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>-gui-include)</b>
              Specify configuration file to be parsed after the default ones.

       <b>-list-options</b>
              Prints all available options.

       <b>-msgcharset</b> <b>&lt;charset&gt;</b>
              Convert  console  messages  to the specified character set (default: autodetect).  Text will be in
              the encoding specified with the --charset configure option.  Set this to "noconv" to disable  con‐
              version (for e.g. iconv problems).
              <u>NOTE:</u>  The option takes effect after command line parsing has finished.  The MPLAYER_CHARSET envi‐
              ronment variable can help you get rid of the first lines of garbled output.

       <b>-msgcolor</b>
              Enable colorful console output on terminals that support ANSI color.

       <b>-msglevel</b> <b>&lt;all=&lt;level&gt;:&lt;module&gt;=&lt;level&gt;:...&gt;</b>
              Control verbosity directly for each module.  The 'all' module changes the  verbosity  of  all  the
              modules not explicitly specified on the command line.  See '-msglevel help' for a list of all mod‐
              ules.
              <u>NOTE:</u>  Some  messages are printed before the command line is parsed and are therefore not affected
              by -msglevel.  To control these messages you have to use the MPLAYER_VERBOSE environment variable,
              see its description below for details.
              Available levels:
                 -1   complete silence
                  0   fatal messages only
                  1   error messages
                  2   warning messages
                  3   short hints
                  4   informational messages
                  5   status messages (default)
                  6   verbose messages
                  7   debug level 2
                  8   debug level 3
                  9   debug level 4

       <b>-msgmodule</b>
              Prepend module name in front of each console message.

       <b>-noconfig</b> <b>&lt;options&gt;</b>
              Do not parse selected configuration files.
              <u>NOTE:</u> If -include or -use-filedir-conf options are specified at the command line, they will be ho‐
              noured.

              Available options are:
                 all
                      all configuration files
                 gui (GUI only)
                      GUI configuration file
                 system
                      system configuration file
                 user
                      user configuration file

       <b>-quiet</b>
              Make console output less verbose; in particular, prevents the status line (i.e. A:   0.7 V:    0.6
              A-V:  0.068 ...) from being displayed.  Particularly useful on slow terminals or broken ones which
              do not properly handle carriage return (i.e. \r).

       <b>-priority</b> <b>&lt;prio&gt;</b> <b>(Windows</b> <b>and</b> <b>OS/2</b> <b>only)</b>
              Set  process  priority  for MPlayer according to the predefined priorities available under Windows
              and OS/2.  Possible values of &lt;prio&gt;:
                 idle|belownormal|normal|abovenormal|high|realtime

              <u>WARNING:</u> Using realtime priority can cause system lockup.

       <b>-profile</b> <b>&lt;profile1,profile2,...&gt;</b>
              Use the given profile(s), -profile help displays a list of the defined profiles.

       <b>-really-quiet</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>-quiet)</b>
              Display even less output and status messages than with -quiet.  Also suppresses the GUI error mes‐
              sage boxes.

       <b>-show-profile</b> <b>&lt;profile&gt;</b>
              Show the description and content of a profile.

       <b>-use-filedir-conf</b>
              Look for a file-specific configuration file in the same  directory  as  the  file  that  is  being
              played.
              <u>WARNING:</u> May be dangerous if playing from untrusted media.

       <b>-v</b>
              Increment verbosity level, one level for each -v found on the command line.

</pre><h4><b>PLAYER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> <b>(MPLAYER</b> <b>ONLY)</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-autoq</b> <b>&lt;quality&gt;</b> <b>(use</b> <b>with</b> <b>-vf</b> <b>[s]pp)</b>
              Dynamically  changes  the  level of postprocessing depending on the available spare CPU time.  The
              number you specify will be the maximum level used.  Usually you can use some big number.  You have
              to use -vf [s]pp without parameters in order for this to work.

       <b>-autosync</b> <b>&lt;factor&gt;</b>
              Gradually adjusts the A/V sync based on audio delay measurements.  Specifying -autosync 0, the de‐
              fault, will cause frame timing to be based entirely on audio delay measurements.  Specifying  -au‐
              tosync  1  will do the same, but will subtly change the A/V correction algorithm.  An uneven video
              framerate in a movie which plays fine with -nosound can often be helped by setting this to an  in‐
              teger value greater than 1.  The higher the value, the closer the timing will be to -nosound.  Try
              -autosync  30 to smooth out problems with sound drivers which do not implement a perfect audio de‐
              lay measurement.  With this value, if large A/V sync offsets occur, they will only take about 1 or
              2 seconds to settle out.  This delay in reaction time to sudden A/V offsets  should  be  the  only
              side-effect of turning this option on, for all sound drivers.

       <b>-benchmark</b>
              Prints some statistics on CPU usage and dropped frames at the end of playback.  Use in combination
              with -nosound and -vo null for benchmarking only the video codec.
              <u>NOTE:</u>  With  this  option MPlayer will also ignore frame duration when playing only video (you can
              think of that as infinite fps).

       <b>-colorkey</b> <b>&lt;number&gt;</b>
              Changes the colorkey to an RGB value of your choice.  0x000000 is black  and  0xffffff  is  white.
              Only supported by the cvidix, fbdev, svga, vesa, winvidix, xmga, xvidix, xover, xv (see -vo xv:ck)
              and directx video output drivers.

       <b>-nocolorkey</b>
              Disables  colorkeying.   Only  supported by the cvidix, fbdev, svga, vesa, winvidix, xmga, xvidix,
              xover, xv (see -vo xv:ck) and directx video output drivers.

       <b>-correct-pts</b> <b>(EXPERIMENTAL)</b>
              Switches MPlayer to an experimental mode where timestamps for video frames are calculated  differ‐
              ently  and video filters which add new frames or modify timestamps of existing ones are supported.
              The more accurate timestamps can be visible for example when  playing  subtitles  timed  to  scene
              changes  with  the -ass option.  Without -correct-pts the subtitle timing will typically be off by
              some frames.  This option does not work correctly with some demuxers and codecs.

       <b>-crash-debug</b> <b>(DEBUG</b> <b>CODE)</b>
              Automatically attaches gdb upon crash or SIGTRAP.  Support must be compiled in by configuring with
              --enable-crash-debug.

       <b>-doubleclick-time</b>
              Time in milliseconds to recognize two consecutive button presses as a double-click (default: 300).
              Set to 0 to let your windowing system decide what a double-click is (-vo directx only).
              <u>NOTE:</u> You will get slightly different behaviour depending on whether you  bind  MOUSE_BTN0_DBL  or
              MOUSE_BTN0-MOUSE_BTN0_DBL.

       <b>-edlout</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Creates  a  new file and writes edit decision list (EDL) records to it.  During playback, the user
              hits 'i' to mark the start or end of a skip block.  This provides a starting point from which  the
              user  can  fine-tune EDL entries later.  See <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/edl.html">http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/edl.html</a> for de‐
              tails.

       <b>-edl-backward-delay</b> <b>&lt;number&gt;</b>
              When using EDL during playback and jumping backwards it is possible to end up in the middle of  an
              EDL  record.   In  that  case MPlayer will seek further backwards to the start position of the EDL
              record and then immediately skip the scene specified in the EDL record.  To avoid this kind of be‐
              havior, MPlayer jumps to a fixed time interval before the start of the EDL record.  This parameter
              allows you to specify that time interval in seconds (default: 2 seconds).

       <b>-edl-start-pts</b>
              Adjust positions in EDL records according to playing file's start time.  Some formats,  especially
              MPEG  TS  usually  start with non-zero PTS values and when producing EDL file with -edlout option,
              EDL records contain absolute values that are correct only for this particular file.  If re-encoded
              into a different format, this EDL file no longer applies.  Specifying -edl-start-pts will automat‐
              ically adjust EDL positions according to start time: when producing EDL file,  it  will  substract
              start  time  from  every  EDL record, when playing with EDL file, it will add file's start time to
              every EDL position.

       <b>-noedl-start-pts</b>
              Disable adjusting EDL positions.

       <b>-enqueue</b> <b>(GUI</b> <b>only)</b>
              Enqueue files given on the command line in the playlist instead of playing them immediately.

       <b>-fixed-vo</b>
              Enforces a fixed video system for multiple files (one (un)initialization for all  files).   There‐
              fore  only  one window will be opened for all files.  Currently the following drivers are fixed-vo
              compliant: gl, gl_tiled, mga, svga, x11, xmga, xv, xvidix and dfbmga.

       <b>-framedrop</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>-hardframedrop,</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>without</b> <b>-nocorrect-pts)</b>
              Skip displaying some frames to maintain A/V sync on slow systems.  Video filters are  not  applied
              to such frames.  For B-frames even decoding is skipped completely.

       <b>-(no)gui</b>
              Enable or disable the GUI interface (default depends on binary name).  Only works as the first ar‐
              gument on the command line.  Does not work as a config-file option.

       <b>-gui-include</b> <b>&lt;GUI</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>file&gt;</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>-include)</b> <b>(GUI</b> <b>only)</b>
              Specify a GUI configuration file to be parsed after the default gui.conf.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>-help,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Show short summary of options.

       <b>-hardframedrop</b> <b>(experimental</b> <b>without</b> <b>-nocorrect-pts)</b>
              More  intense  frame dropping (breaks decoding).  Leads to image distortion!  Note that especially
              the libmpeg2 decoder may crash with this, so consider using "-vc ffmpeg12,".

       <b>-heartbeat-cmd</b>
              Command that is executed every 30 seconds during playback via system() - i.e. using the shell.

              <u>NOTE:</u> MPlayer uses this command without any checking, it is your responsibility to ensure it  does
              not  cause security problems (e.g. make sure to use full paths if "." is in your path like on Win‐
              dows).  It also only works when playing video (i.e. not with -novideo but works with -vo null).

              This can be "misused" to disable screensavers that do not support  the  proper  X  API  (also  see
              -stop-xscreensaver).  If you think this is too complicated, ask the author of the screensaver pro‐
              gram to support the proper X APIs.

              <u>EXAMPLE</u> <u>for</u> <u>xscreensaver:</u> mplayer -heartbeat-cmd "xscreensaver-command -deactivate" file

              <u>EXAMPLE</u> <u>for</u> <u>GNOME</u> <u>screensaver:</u> mplayer -heartbeat-cmd "gnome-screensaver-command -p" file

       <b>-heartbeat-interval</b>
              Specify  how  often the -heartbeat-cmd should be executed, in seconds between executions (default:
              30.0).

       <b>-identify</b>
              Shorthand for -msglevel identify=6.  Show file parameters in an  easily  parseable  format.   Also
              prints  more  detailed information about subtitle and audio track languages and IDs.  For example,
              for a DVD or Blu-ray it will list the chapters and time length of each title, as well  as  a  disk
              ID.   Combine this with -frames 0 to suppress all video output.  The wrapper script TOOLS/midenti‐
              fy.sh suppresses the other MPlayer output and (hopefully) shellescapes the filenames.  You can get
              less information by using -msglevel identify=4.

       <b>-idle</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>-slave)</b>
              Makes MPlayer wait idly instead of quitting when there is no file to play.  Mostly useful in slave
              mode where MPlayer can be controlled through input commands.
              For <b>gmplayer</b> -idle is the default, -noidle will quit the GUI after all files have been played.

       <b>-input</b> <b>&lt;commands&gt;</b>
              This option can be used to configure certain parts of the input system.   Paths  are  relative  to
              <a href="file:~/.mplayer/.">~/.mplayer/.</a>
              <u>NOTE:</u> Autorepeat is currently only supported by joysticks.

              Available commands are:

                 conf=&lt;filename&gt;
                      Specify  input configuration file other than the default <a href="file:~/.mplayer/input.conf.">~/.mplayer/input.conf.</a>  <a href="file:~/.mplay">~/.mplay</a>‐
                      er/&lt;filename&gt; is assumed if no full path is given.
                 ar-dev=&lt;device&gt;
                      Device to be used for Apple IR Remote (default is autodetected, Linux only).
                 ar-delay
                      Delay in milliseconds before we start to autorepeat a key (0 to disable).
                 ar-rate
                      Number of key presses to generate per second on autorepeat.
                 (no)default-bindings
                      Use the key bindings that MPlayer ships with by default.
                 keylist
                      Prints all keys that can be bound to commands.
                 cmdlist
                      Prints all commands that can be bound to keys.
                 js-dev
                      Specifies the joystick device to use (default: /dev/input/js0).
                 file=&lt;filename&gt;
                      Read commands from the given file.  Mostly useful with a FIFO.
                      <u>NOTE:</u> When the given file is a FIFO MPlayer opens both ends so you can  do  several  'echo
                      "seek 10" &gt; mp_pipe' and the pipe will stay valid.

       <b>-key-fifo-size</b> <b>&lt;2-65000&gt;</b>
              Specify  the  size  of the FIFO that buffers key events (default: 7).  A FIFO of size n can buffer
              (n-1) events.  If it is too small some events may be lost.  If it is too big, MPlayer may seem  to
              hang  while  it processes the buffered events.  To get the same behavior as before this option was
              introduced, set it to 2 for Linux or 1024 for Windows.  For small value you should disable double-
              clicks by setting -doubleclick-time to 0 so they do not compete with  regular  events  for  buffer
              space.

       <b>-lircconf</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> <b>(LIRC</b> <b>only)</b>
              Specifies a configuration file for LIRC (default: <a href="file:~/.lircrc">~/.lircrc</a>).

       <b>-list-properties</b>
              Print a list of the available properties.

       <b>-loop</b> <b>&lt;number&gt;</b>
              Loops the playback &lt;number&gt; times.
              0  means forever.  Use -loop 0 &lt;URL|filename&gt; to automatically reconnect to live streaming URLs or
              files yet to be created or to be replaced.
              -loop &lt;number&gt; &lt;URL|filename&gt; opens the URL or file &lt;number&gt; times in a row and plays it once each
              time, while &lt;URL|filename&gt; -loop &lt;number&gt; opens the URL or file once and plays it  &lt;number&gt;  times
              in a loop, which is usually what you want.

       <b>-menu</b> <b>(OSD</b> <b>menu</b> <b>only)</b>
              Turn on OSD menu support.

       <b>-menu-cfg</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> <b>(OSD</b> <b>menu</b> <b>only)</b>
              Use an alternative menu.conf.

       <b>-menu-chroot</b> <b>&lt;path&gt;</b> <b>(OSD</b> <b>menu</b> <b>only)</b>
              Chroot the file selection menu to a specific location.

              <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                 -menu-chroot <a href="file:/home">/home</a>
                      Will  restrict  the file selection menu to <a href="file:/home">/home</a> and downward (i.e. no access to / will be
                      possible, but /home/user_name will).

       <b>-menu-keepdir</b> <b>(OSD</b> <b>menu</b> <b>only)</b>
              File browser starts from the last known location instead of current directory.

       <b>-menu-root</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b> <b>(OSD</b> <b>menu</b> <b>only)</b>
              Specify the main menu.

       <b>-menu-startup</b> <b>(OSD</b> <b>menu</b> <b>only)</b>
              Display the main menu at MPlayer startup.

       <b>-mouse-movements</b>
              Permit MPlayer to receive pointer events reported by the video output driver.  Necessary to select
              the buttons in DVD menus.  Supported for X11-based VOs (x11, xv, etc) and the  gl,  gl_tiled,  di‐
              rect3d and corevideo VOs.

       <b>-noar</b>  Turns off AppleIR remote support.

       <b>-noconsolecontrols</b>
              Prevent  MPlayer from reading key events from standard input.  Useful when reading data from stan‐
              dard input.  This is automatically enabled when - is found on the command line.  There are  situa‐
              tions  where  you  have to set it manually, e.g. if you open <a href="file:/dev/stdin">/dev/stdin</a> (or the equivalent on your
              system), use stdin in a playlist or intend to read from stdin later on via the loadfile  or  load‐
              list slave commands.

       <b>-nojoystick</b>
              Turns off joystick support.

       <b>-nolirc</b>
              Turns off LIRC support.

       <b>-nomouseinput</b>
              Disable mouse button press/release input (mozplayerxp's context menu relies on this option).

       <b>-rtc</b> <b>(RTC</b> <b>only)</b>
              Turns  on  usage  of the Linux RTC (realtime clock - /dev/rtc) as timing mechanism.  This wakes up
              the process every 1/1024 seconds to check the current time.  Useless  with  modern  Linux  kernels
              configured  for  desktop  use as they already wake up the process with similar accuracy when using
              normal timed sleep.

       <b>-pausing</b> <b>&lt;0-3&gt;</b> <b>(MPlayer</b> <b>only)</b>
              Specifies the default pausing behaviour of commands, i.e. whether MPlayer will  continue  playback
              or stay paused after the command has finished.  See DOCS/tech/slave.txt for further details.
                 0    resume
                 1    pause (pausing)
                 2    keep the paused / playing status (pausing_keep)
                 3    toggle the paused / playing status (pausing_toggle)
                 4    pause without frame step (experimental) (pausing_keep_force)

       <b>-playing-msg</b> <b>&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Print out a string before starting playback.  The following expansions are supported:

                 ${NAME}
                      Expand to the value of the property NAME.

                 ?(NAME:TEXT)
                      Expand TEXT only if the property NAME is available.

                 ?(!NAME:TEXT)
                      Expand TEXT only if the property NAME is not available.

       <b>-playlist</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Play files according to a playlist file (ASX, Winamp, SMIL, or one-file-per-line format).
              <u>WARNING:</u> The way MPlayer parses and uses playlist files is not safe against maliciously construct‐
              ed  files.   Such  files may trigger harmful actions.  This has been the case for all MPlayer ver‐
              sions, but unfortunately this fact was not well documented earlier, and some people have even mis‐
              guidedly recommended use of -playlist with untrusted sources.  Do NOT use  -playlist  with  random
              internet sources or files you don't trust!
              <u>NOTE:</u> This option is considered an entry so options found after it will apply only to the elements
              of this playlist.
              FIXME: This needs to be clarified and documented thoroughly.

       <b>-allow-dangerous-playlist-parsing</b>
              This  enables parsing any file as a playlist if e.g. a server advertises a file as playlist.  Only
              enable if you know all servers involved are trustworthy.  MPlayer's playlist code is not  designed
              to handle malicious playlist files.

       <b>-rtc-device</b> <b>&lt;device&gt;</b>
              Use the specified device for RTC timing.

       <b>-shuffle</b>
              Play files in random order.

       <b>-skin</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>(GUI</b> <b>only)</b>
              Loads a skin from the directory given as parameter below the default skin directories, <a href="file:~/.mplayer/">~/.mplayer/</a>
              skins/ and /usr/local/share/mplayer/skins/.

              <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                 -skin fittyfene
                      Tries <a href="file:~/.mplayer/skins/fittyfene">~/.mplayer/skins/fittyfene</a> and afterwards /usr/local/share/mplayer/skins/fittyfene.

       <b>-slave</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>-input)</b>
              Switches on slave mode, in which MPlayer works as a backend for other programs.  Instead of inter‐
              cepting keyboard events, MPlayer will read commands separated by a newline (\n) from stdin.
              <u>NOTE:</u>  See  -input cmdlist for a list of slave commands and DOCS/tech/slave.txt for their descrip‐
              tion.  Also, this is not intended to disable other inputs, e.g. via the  video  window,  use  some
              other method like -input nodefault-bindings:conf=/dev/null for that.

       <b>-softsleep</b>
              Time frames by repeatedly checking the current time instead of asking the kernel to wake up MPlay‐
              er  at the correct time.  Useful if your kernel timing is imprecise and you cannot use the RTC ei‐
              ther.  Comes at the price of higher CPU consumption.

       <b>-sstep</b> <b>&lt;sec&gt;</b>
              Skip &lt;sec&gt; seconds after every frame.  The normal framerate of the movie is kept, so  playback  is
              accelerated.  Since MPlayer can only seek to the next keyframe this may be inexact.

       <b>-udp-ip</b> <b>&lt;ip&gt;</b>
              Sets the destination address for datagrams sent by the -udp-master.  Setting it to a broadcast ad‐
              dress  allows  multiple  slaves  having the same broadcast address to sync to the master (default:
              127.0.0.1).

       <b>-udp-master</b>
              Send a datagram to -udp-ip on -udp-port just before playing each frame.   The  datagram  indicates
              the master's position in the file.

       <b>-udp-port</b> <b>&lt;port&gt;</b>
              Sets the destination port for datagrams sent by the -udp-master, and the port a -udp-slave listens
              on (default: 23867).

       <b>-udp-seek-threshold</b> <b>&lt;sec&gt;</b>
              When the master seeks, the slave has to decide whether to seek as well, or to catch up by decoding
              frames  without  pausing  between  frames.  If the master is more than &lt;sec&gt; seconds away from the
              slave, the slave seeks.  Otherwise, it "runs" to catch up or waits for the  master.   This  should
              almost always be left at its default setting of 1 second.

       <b>-udp-slave</b>
              Listen on -udp-port and match the master's position.

</pre><h4><b>DEMUXER/STREAM</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a52drc</b> <b>&lt;level&gt;</b>
              Select the Dynamic Range Compression level for AC-3 audio streams.  &lt;level&gt; is a float value rang‐
              ing  from 0 to 1, where 0 means no compression and 1 (which is the default) means full compression
              (make loud passages more silent and vice versa).  Values up to 2 are also accepted, but are purely
              experimental.  This option only shows an effect if the AC-3 stream  contains  the  required  range
              compression information.

       <b>-aid</b> <b>&lt;ID&gt;</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>-alang)</b>
              Select  audio  channel  (MPEG:  0-31, AVI/OGM: 1-99, ASF/RM: 0-127, VOB(AC-3): 128-159, VOB(LPCM):
              160-191, MPEG-TS 17-8190).  MPlayer prints the available audio IDs when run in verbose (-v)  mode.
              When  playing an MPEG-TS stream, MPlayer/MEncoder will use the first program (if present) with the
              chosen audio stream.

       <b>-ausid</b> <b>&lt;ID&gt;</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>-alang)</b>
              Select audio substream channel.  Currently the valid range is 0x55..0x75 and applies only to MPEG-
              TS when handled by the native demuxer (not by libavformat).  The format type may not be  correctly
              identified  because  of  how  this information (or lack thereof) is embedded in the stream, but it
              will demux correctly the audio streams when multiple substreams are present.  MPlayer  prints  the
              available substream IDs when run with -identify.

       <b>-alang</b> <b>&lt;language</b> <b>code[,language</b> <b>code,...]&gt;</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>-aid)</b>
              Specify  a  priority list of audio languages to use.  Different container formats employ different
              language codes.  DVDs use ISO 639-1 two letter language codes, Matroska, MPEG-TS and NUT  use  ISO
              639-2  three  letter  language  codes  while  OGM uses a free-form identifier.  MPlayer prints the
              available languages when run in verbose (-v) mode.

              <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                 mplayer dvd://1 -alang hu,en
                      Chooses the Hungarian language track on a DVD and falls back on English  if  Hungarian  is
                      not available.
                 mplayer -alang jpn example.mkv
                      Plays a Matroska file in Japanese.

       <b>-audio-demuxer</b> <b>&lt;[+]name&gt;</b> <b>(-audiofile</b> <b>only)</b>
              Force  audio  demuxer  type for -audiofile.  Use a '+' before the name to force it, this will skip
              some checks!  Give the demuxer name as printed by -audio-demuxer help.  For backward compatibility
              it also accepts the demuxer ID as defined in libmpdemux/demuxer.h.  -audio-demuxer audio  or  -au‐
              dio-demuxer 17 forces MP3.

       <b>-audiofile</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Play audio from an external file (WAV, MP3 or Ogg Vorbis) while viewing a movie.

       <b>-audiofile-cache</b> <b>&lt;kBytes&gt;</b>
              Enables caching for the stream used by -audiofile, using the specified amount of memory.

       <b>-reuse-socket</b> <b>(udp://</b> <b>only)</b>
              Allows a socket to be reused by other processes as soon as it is closed.

       <b>-bandwidth</b> <b>&lt;Bytes&gt;</b> <b>(network</b> <b>only)</b>
              Specify  the maximum bandwidth for network streaming (for servers that are able to send content in
              different bitrates).  Useful if you want to watch live streamed media behind  a  slow  connection.
              With  Real  RTSP  streaming, it is also used to set the maximum delivery bandwidth allowing faster
              cache filling and stream dumping.

       <b>-bluray-angle</b> <b>&lt;angle</b> <b>ID&gt;</b> <b>(Blu-ray</b> <b>only)</b>
              Some Blu-ray discs contain scenes that can be viewed from multiple  angles.   Here  you  can  tell
              MPlayer which angles to use (default: 1).

       <b>-bluray-device</b> <b>&lt;path</b> <b>to</b> <b>disc&gt;</b> <b>(Blu-ray</b> <b>only)</b>
              Specify the Blu-ray disc location. Must be a directory with Blu-ray structure.

       <b>-cache</b> <b>&lt;kBytes&gt;</b>
              This option specifies how much memory (in kBytes) to use when precaching a file or URL.  Especial‐
              ly useful on slow media.

       <b>-nocache</b>
              Turns off caching.

       <b>-cache-min</b> <b>&lt;percentage&gt;</b>
              Playback will start when the cache has been filled up to &lt;percentage&gt; of the total.

       <b>-cache-seek-min</b> <b>&lt;percentage&gt;</b>
              If a seek is to be made to a position within &lt;percentage&gt; of the cache size from the current posi‐
              tion,  MPlayer  will  wait  for  the  cache to be filled to this position rather than performing a
              stream seek (default: 50).

       <b>-capture</b> <b>(MPlayer</b> <b>only)</b>
              Allows capturing the primary stream (not additional audio tracks or other kind  of  streams)  into
              the  file specified by -dumpfile or by default.  If this option is given, capturing can be started
              and stopped by pressing the key bound to this function (see section INTERACTIVE CONTROL).  Same as
              for -dumpstream, this will likely not produce usable results for anything else than MPEG  streams.
              Note  that,  due  to cache latencies, captured data may begin and end somewhat delayed compared to
              what you see displayed.

       <b>-cdda</b> <b>&lt;option1:option2&gt;</b> <b>(CDDA</b> <b>only)</b>
              This option can be used to tune the CD Audio reading feature of MPlayer.

              Available options are:

                 speed=&lt;value&gt;
                      Set CD spin speed.

                 paranoia=&lt;0-2&gt;
                      Set paranoia level.  Values other than 0 seem to break playback of anything but the  first
                      track.
                         0: disable checking (default)
                         1: overlap checking only
                         2: full data correction and verification

                 generic-dev=&lt;value&gt;
                      Use specified generic SCSI device.

                 sector-size=&lt;value&gt;
                      Set atomic read size.

                 overlap=&lt;value&gt;
                      Force minimum overlap search during verification to &lt;value&gt; sectors.

                 toc-bias
                      Assume  that  the  beginning offset of track 1 as reported in the TOC will be addressed as
                      LBA 0.  Some Toshiba drives need this for getting track boundaries correct.

                 toc-offset=&lt;value&gt;
                      Add &lt;value&gt; sectors to the values reported when addressing tracks.  May be negative.

                 (no)skip
                      (Never) accept imperfect data reconstruction.

       <b>-cdrom-device</b> <b>&lt;path</b> <b>to</b> <b>device&gt;</b>
              Specify the CD-ROM device (default: /dev/cdrom).

       <b>-channels</b> <b>&lt;number&gt;</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>-af</b> <b>channels)</b>
              Request the number of playback channels (default: 2).  MPlayer asks the decoder to decode the  au‐
              dio  into as many channels as specified.  Then it is up to the decoder to fulfill the requirement.
              This is usually only important when playing videos with AC-3 audio (like DVDs).  In that case  li‐
              ba52  does  the decoding by default and correctly downmixes the audio into the requested number of
              channels.  To directly control the number of output channels independently of  how  many  channels
              are decoded, use the channels filter.
              <u>NOTE:</u>  This  option  is honored by codecs (AC-3 only), filters (surround) and audio output drivers
              (OSS at least).

              Available options are:

                 2    stereo
                 4    surround
                 6    full 5.1
                 8    full 7.1

       <b>-chapter</b> <b>&lt;chapter</b> <b>ID&gt;[-&lt;endchapter</b> <b>ID&gt;]</b>
              Specify which chapter to start playing at.  Optionally specify which chapter  to  end  playing  at
              (default: 1).

       <b>-cookies</b> <b>(network</b> <b>only)</b>
              Send cookies when making HTTP requests.

       <b>-cookies-file</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> <b>(network</b> <b>only)</b>
              Read  HTTP  cookies  from &lt;filename&gt; (default: <a href="file:~/.mozilla/">~/.mozilla/</a> and <a href="file:~/.netscape/">~/.netscape/</a>) and skip reading from
              default locations.  The file is assumed to be in Netscape format.

       <b>-delay</b> <b>&lt;sec&gt;</b>
              audio delay in seconds (positive or negative float value)
              Negative values delay the audio, and positive values delay the video.  Note that this is the exact
              opposite of the -audio-delay MEncoder option.
              <u>NOTE:</u> When used with MEncoder, this is not guaranteed to work correctly with -ovc copy;  use  -au‐
              dio-delay instead.

       <b>-ignore-start</b>
              Ignore  the  specified  starting time for streams in AVI files.  In MPlayer, this nullifies stream
              delays in files encoded with the -audio-delay option.  During encoding, this option prevents  MEn‐
              coder  from  transferring  original stream start times to the new file; the -audio-delay option is
              not affected.  Note that MEncoder sometimes adjusts stream starting times automatically to compen‐
              sate for anticipated decoding delays, so do not use this option for encoding  without  testing  it
              first.

       <b>-demuxer</b> <b>&lt;[+]name&gt;</b>
              Force  demuxer type.  Use a '+' before the name to force it, this will skip some checks!  Give the
              demuxer name as printed by -demuxer help.  For backward compatibility it also accepts the  demuxer
              ID as defined in libmpdemux/demuxer.h.

       <b>-dumpaudio</b> <b>(MPlayer</b> <b>only)</b>
              Dumps raw compressed audio stream to ./stream.dump (useful with MPEG/AC-3, in most other cases the
              resulting file will not be playable).  If you give more than one of -dumpaudio, -dumpvideo, -dump‐
              stream on the command line only the last one will work.

       <b>-dumpfile</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> <b>(MPlayer</b> <b>only)</b>
              Specify which file MPlayer should dump to.  Should be used together with -dumpaudio / -dumpvideo /
              -dumpstream / -capture.

       <b>-dumpstream</b> <b>(MPlayer</b> <b>only)</b>
              Dumps the raw stream to ./stream.dump.  Useful when ripping from DVD or network.  If you give more
              than one of -dumpaudio, -dumpvideo, -dumpstream on the command line only the last one will work.

       <b>-dumpvideo</b> <b>(MPlayer</b> <b>only)</b>
              Dump raw compressed video stream to ./stream.dump (not very usable).  If you give more than one of
              -dumpaudio, -dumpvideo, -dumpstream on the command line only the last one will work.

       <b>-dvbin</b> <b>&lt;options&gt;</b> <b>(DVB</b> <b>only)</b>
              Pass the following parameters to the DVB input module, in order to override the default ones:

                 card=&lt;1-4&gt;
                      Specifies using card number 1-4 (default: 1).
                 file=&lt;filename&gt;
                      Instructs  MPlayer to read the channels list from &lt;filename&gt;.  Default is <a href="file:~/.mplayer/chan">~/.mplayer/chan</a>‐
                      nels.conf.{sat,ter,cbl,atsc} (based on your card type) or  <a href="file:~/.mplayer/channels.conf">~/.mplayer/channels.conf</a>  as  a
                      last resort.
                 timeout=&lt;1-240&gt;
                      Maximum  number  of  seconds to wait when trying to tune a frequency before giving up (de‐
                      fault: 30).

       <b>-dvd-device</b> <b>&lt;path</b> <b>to</b> <b>device&gt;</b> <b>(DVD</b> <b>only)</b>
              Specify the DVD device or .iso filename (default: /dev/dvd).  You can  also  specify  a  directory
              that contains files previously copied directly from a DVD (with e.g. vobcopy).

       <b>-dvd-speed</b> <b>&lt;factor</b> <b>or</b> <b>speed</b> <b>in</b> <b>KB/s&gt;</b> <b>(DVD</b> <b>only)</b>
              Try  to  limit DVD speed (default: 0, no change).  DVD base speed is about 1350KB/s, so a 8x drive
              can read at speeds up to 10800KB/s.  Slower speeds make the drive more quiet,  for  watching  DVDs
              2700KB/s  should be quiet and fast enough.  MPlayer resets the speed to the drive default value on
              close.  Values less than 100 mean multiples of 1350KB/s, i.e. -dvd-speed 8 selects 10800KB/s.
              <u>NOTE:</u> You need write access to the DVD device to change the speed.

       <b>-dvdangle</b> <b>&lt;angle</b> <b>ID&gt;</b> <b>(DVD</b> <b>only)</b>
              Some DVD discs contain scenes that can be viewed from multiple angles.  Here you can tell  MPlayer
              which angles to use (default: 1).

       <b>-edl</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Enables  edit  decision  list (EDL) actions during playback.  Video will be skipped over and audio
              will be muted and unmuted according to the entries in the  given  file.   See  <a href="http://www.mplayer">http://www.mplayer</a>‐
              hq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/edl.html for details on how to use this.

       <b>-endpos</b> <b>&lt;[[hh:]mm:]ss[.ms]|size[b|kb|mb]&gt;</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>-ss</b> <b>and</b> <b>-sb)</b>
              Stop at given time or byte position.
              <u>NOTE:</u>  Byte  position  may not be accurate, as it can only stop at a frame boundary.  When used in
              conjunction with -ss option, -endpos time will shift forward by seconds specified with -ss if  not
              a  byte  position.  In addition it may not work well or not at all when used with any of the -dump
              options.

              <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                 -endpos 56
                      Stop at 56 seconds.
                 -endpos 01:10:00
                      Stop at 1 hour 10 minutes.
                 -ss 10 -endpos 56
                      Stop at 1 minute 6 seconds.
                 mplayer -endpos 100mb
                      Stop playback after reading 100MB of the input file.
                 mencoder -endpos 100mb
                      Encode only 100 MB.

       <b>-forceidx</b>
              Force index rebuilding.  Useful for files with broken index (A/V desync, etc).  This  will  enable
              seeking  in files where seeking was not possible.  You can fix the index permanently with MEncoder
              (see the documentation).
              <u>NOTE:</u> This option only works if the underlying media supports seeking (i.e. not with stdin,  pipe,
              etc).

       <b>-fps</b> <b>&lt;float</b> <b>value&gt;</b>
              Override video framerate.  Useful if the original value is wrong or missing.

       <b>-frames</b> <b>&lt;number&gt;</b>
              Play/convert only first &lt;number&gt; frames, then quit.

       <b>-hr-mp3-seek</b> <b>(MP3</b> <b>only)</b>
              Hi-res  MP3  seeking.   Enabled  when playing from an external MP3 file, as we need to seek to the
              very exact position to keep A/V sync.  Can be slow especially when seeking backwards since it  has
              to rewind to the beginning to find an exact frame position.

       <b>-http-header-fields</b> <b>&lt;field1,field2&gt;</b>
              Set custom HTTP fields when accessing HTTP stream.

              <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                      mplayer -http-header-fields 'Field1: value1','Field2: value2' <a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:1234
                      Will generate HTTP request:
                         GET / HTTP/1.0
                         Host: localhost:1234
                         User-Agent: MPlayer
                         Icy-MetaData: 1
                         Field1: value1
                         Field2: value2
                         Connection: close

       <b>-idx</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>-forceidx)</b>
              Rebuilds  index  of  files if no index was found, allowing seeking.  Useful with broken/incomplete
              downloads, or badly created files.
              <u>NOTE:</u> This option only works if the underlying media supports seeking (i.e. not with stdin,  pipe,
              etc).

       <b>-noidx</b> Skip rebuilding index file.  MEncoder skips writing the index with this option.

       <b>-ipv4-only-proxy</b> <b>(network</b> <b>only)</b>
              Skip the proxy for IPv6 addresses.  It will still be used for IPv4 connections.

       <b>-lavfstreamopts</b> <b>&lt;options&gt;</b>
              Specify extra options for libavformat based streams.

       <b>-loadidx</b> <b>&lt;index</b> <b>file&gt;</b>
              The  file  from which to read the video index data saved by -saveidx.  This index will be used for
              seeking, overriding any index data contained in the AVI itself.  MPlayer will not prevent you from
              loading an index file generated from a different AVI, but this is sure to  cause  unfavorable  re‐
              sults.
              <u>NOTE:</u> This option is obsolete now that MPlayer has OpenDML support.

       <b>-mc</b> <b>&lt;seconds/frame&gt;</b>
              maximum A-V sync correction per frame (in seconds)
              -mc  0  should  always  be  combined with -noskip for mencoder, otherwise it will almost certainly
              cause A-V desync.

       <b>-mf</b> <b>&lt;option1:option2:...&gt;</b>
              Used when decoding from multiple PNG or JPEG files.

              Available options are:

                 w=&lt;value&gt;
                      input file width (default: autodetect)
                 h=&lt;value&gt;
                      input file height (default: autodetect)
                 fps=&lt;value&gt;
                      output fps (default: 25)
                 type=&lt;value&gt;
                      input file type (available: jpeg, png, tga, sgi)

       <b>-ni</b>    Force treating files as non-interleaved.  In particular forces usage of non-interleaved AVI parser
              (fixes playback of some bad AVI files).  Can also help playing files that otherwise play audio and
              video alternating instead of at the same time.  This can significantly increase memory usage, thus
              it would be preferable to fix interleaving of affected files.

       <b>-nobps</b> <b>(AVI</b> <b>only)</b>
              Do not use average byte/second value for A-V sync.  Helps with some AVI files with broken header.

       <b>-noextbased</b>
              Disables extension-based demuxer selection.  By default, when the file type  (demuxer)  cannot  be
              detected reliably (the file has no header or it is not reliable enough), the filename extension is
              used to select the demuxer.  Always falls back on content-based demuxer selection.

       <b>-passwd</b> <b>&lt;password&gt;</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>-user)</b> <b>(network</b> <b>only)</b>
              Specify password for HTTP authentication.

       <b>-prefer-ipv4</b> <b>(network</b> <b>only)</b>
              Use IPv4 on network connections.  Falls back on IPv6 automatically.

       <b>-prefer-ipv6</b> <b>(IPv6</b> <b>network</b> <b>only)</b>
              Use IPv6 on network connections.  Falls back on IPv4 automatically.

       <b>-psprobe</b> <b>&lt;byte</b> <b>position&gt;</b>
              When  playing  an  MPEG-PS or MPEG-PES streams, this option lets you specify how many bytes in the
              stream you want MPlayer to scan in order to identify the video codec used.  This option is  needed
              to play EVO or VDR files containing H.264 streams.

       <b>-pvr</b> <b>&lt;option1:option2:...&gt;</b> <b>(PVR</b> <b>only)</b>
              This  option  tunes various encoding properties of the PVR capture module.  It has to be used with
              any hardware MPEG  encoder  based  card  supported  by  the  V4L2  driver.   The  Hauppauge  WinTV
              PVR-150/250/350/500  and  all IVTV based cards are known as PVR capture cards.  Be aware that only
              Linux 2.6.18 kernel and above is able to handle MPEG stream through V4L2 layer.  For hardware cap‐
              ture of an MPEG stream and watching it with MPlayer/MEncoder, use 'pvr://' as a movie URL.

              Available options are:

                 aspect=&lt;0-3&gt;
                      Specify input aspect ratio:
                         0: 1:1
                         1: 4:3 (default)
                         2: 16:9
                         3: 2.21:1

                 arate=&lt;32000-48000&gt;
                      Specify encoding audio rate (default: 48000 Hz, available: 32000, 44100 and 48000 Hz).

                 alayer=&lt;1-5&gt;
                      Specify MPEG audio layer encoding (default: 2).

                 abitrate=&lt;32-448&gt;
                      Specify audio encoding bitrate in kbps (default: 384).

                 amode=&lt;value&gt;
                      Specify audio encoding mode.  Available preset values are 'stereo', 'joint_stereo', 'dual'
                      and 'mono' (default: stereo).

                 vbitrate=&lt;value&gt;
                      Specify average video bitrate encoding in Mbps (default: 6).

                 vmode=&lt;value&gt;
                      Specify video encoding mode:
                         vbr: Variable BitRate (default)
                         cbr: Constant BitRate

                 vpeak=&lt;value&gt;
                      Specify peak video bitrate encoding in Mbps (only useful for VBR encoding, default: 9.6).

                 fmt=&lt;value&gt;
                      Choose an MPEG format for encoding:
                         ps:    MPEG-2 Program Stream (default)
                         ts:    MPEG-2 Transport Stream
                         mpeg1: MPEG-1 System Stream

                         svcd:  Super Video CD compatible stream
                         dvd:   DVD compatible stream

       <b>-radio</b> <b>&lt;option1:option2:...&gt;</b> <b>(radio</b> <b>only)</b>
              These options set various parameters of the radio capture module.  For  listening  to  radio  with
              MPlayer  use 'radio://&lt;frequency&gt;' (if channels option is not given) or 'radio://&lt;channel_number&gt;'
              (if channels option is given) as a movie URL.  You can see  allowed  frequency  range  by  running
              MPlayer with '-v'.  To start the grabbing subsystem, use 'radio://&lt;frequency or channel&gt;/capture'.
              If  the  capture keyword is not given you can listen to radio using the line-in cable only.  Using
              capture to listen is not recommended due to synchronization problems, which makes this process un‐
              comfortable.

              Available options are:

                 device=&lt;value&gt;
                      Radio device to use (default: /dev/radio0 for Linux and /dev/tuner0 for *BSD).

                 driver=&lt;value&gt;
                      Radio driver to use (default: v4l2 if available, otherwise v4l).  Currently, v4l and  v4l2
                      drivers are supported.

                 volume=&lt;0..100&gt;
                      sound volume for radio device (default 100)

                 freq_min=&lt;value&gt; (*BSD BT848 only)
                      minimum allowed frequency (default: 87.50)

                 freq_max=&lt;value&gt; (*BSD BT848 only)
                      maximum allowed frequency (default: 108.00)

                 channels=&lt;frequency&gt;-&lt;name&gt;,&lt;frequency&gt;-&lt;name&gt;,...
                      Set channel list.  Use _ for spaces in names (or play with quoting ;-).  The channel names
                      will  then  be  written  using  OSD  and  the  slave  commands  radio_step_channel and ra‐
                      dio_set_channel will be usable for a remote control (see LIRC).  If given, number in movie
                      URL will be treated as channel position in channel list.
                      <u>EXAMPLE:</u> radio://1, radio://104.4, radio_set_channel 1

                 adevice=&lt;value&gt; (radio capture only)
                      Name of device to capture sound from.  Without such a name capture will be disabled,  even
                      if  the  capture  keyword  appears  in  the  URL.   For  ALSA  devices  use it in the form
                      hw=&lt;card&gt;.&lt;device&gt;.  If the device name contains a '=', the module will use ALSA  to  cap‐
                      ture, otherwise OSS.

                 arate=&lt;value&gt; (radio capture only)
                      Rate in samples per second (default: 44100).
                      <u>NOTE:</u>  When using audio capture set also -rawaudio rate=&lt;value&gt; option with the same value
                      as arate.  If you have problems with sound speed (runs too quickly), try to play with dif‐
                      ferent rate values (e.g. 48000,44100,32000,...).

                 achannels=&lt;value&gt; (radio capture only)
                      Number of audio channels to capture.

       <b>-rawaudio</b> <b>&lt;option1:option2:...&gt;</b>
              This option lets you play raw audio files.  You have to use -demuxer rawaudio as well.  It may al‐
              so be used to play audio CDs which are not 44kHz 16-bit stereo.  For playing raw AC-3 streams  use
              -rawaudio format=0x2000 -demuxer rawaudio.

              Available options are:

       <b>-rtsp-port</b>
              Used with 'rtsp://' URLs to force the client's port number.  This option may be useful if you  are
              behind a router and want to forward the RTSP stream from the server to a specific client.

       <b>-rtsp-destination</b>
              Used with 'rtsp://' URLs to force the destination IP address to be bound.  This option may be use‐
              ful with some RTSP server which do not send RTP packets to the right interface.  If the connection
              to the RTSP server fails, use -v to see which IP address MPlayer tries to bind to and try to force
              it to one assigned to your computer instead.

       <b>-rtsp-stream-over-tcp</b> <b>(LIVE555</b> <b>and</b> <b>NEMESI</b> <b>only)</b>
              Used  with  'rtsp://' URLs to specify that the resulting incoming RTP and RTCP packets be streamed
              over TCP (using the same TCP connection as RTSP).  This option may be useful if you have a  broken
              internet connection that does not pass incoming UDP packets (see <a href="http://www.live555.com/mplayer/">http://www.live555.com/mplayer/</a>).

       <b>-rtsp-stream-over-http</b> <b>(LIVE555</b> <b>only)</b>
              Used  with  'http://' URLs to specify that the resulting incoming RTP and RTCP packets be streamed
              over HTTP.

       <b>-saveidx</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Force index rebuilding and dump the index to &lt;filename&gt;.   Currently  this  only  works  with  AVI
              files.
              <u>NOTE:</u> This option is obsolete now that MPlayer has OpenDML support.

       <b>-sb</b> <b>&lt;byte</b> <b>position&gt;</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>-ss)</b>
              Seek  to  byte position.  Useful for playback from CD-ROM images or VOB files with junk at the be‐
              ginning.

       <b>-speed</b> <b>&lt;0.01-100&gt;</b>
              Slow down or speed up playback by the factor given as parameter.  Not guaranteed to work correctly
              with -oac copy.  Add -af scaletempo to get past the 4x limit on playback.

       <b>-srate</b> <b>&lt;Hz&gt;</b>
              Select the output sample rate to be used (of course sound cards have limits on this).  If the sam‐
              ple frequency selected is different from that of the current media, the resample  or  lavcresample
              audio  filter  will be inserted into the audio filter layer to compensate for the difference.  The
              type of resampling can be controlled by the -af-adv option.  The default is fast  resampling  that
              may cause distortion.

       <b>-ss</b> <b>&lt;time&gt;</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>-sb)</b>
              Seek to given time position.  Use -ss nopts to disable seeking, -ss 0 has different behaviour.

              <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                 -ss 56
                      Seeks to 56 seconds.
                 -ss 01:10:00
                      Seeks to 1 hour 10 min.

       <b>-tskeepbroken</b>
              Tells  MPlayer  not  to  discard TS packets reported as broken in the stream.  Sometimes needed to
              play corrupted MPEG-TS files.

       <b>-tsprobe</b> <b>&lt;byte</b> <b>position&gt;</b>
              When playing an MPEG-TS stream, this option lets you specify how many bytes in the stream you want
              MPlayer to search for the desired audio and video IDs.

       <b>-tsprog</b> <b>&lt;1-65534&gt;</b>
              When playing an MPEG-TS stream, you can specify with this option which program  (if  present)  you
              want to play.  Can be used with -vid and -aid.

       <b>-tv</b> <b>&lt;option1:option2:...&gt;</b> <b>(TV/PVR</b> <b>only)</b>
              This  option tunes various properties of the TV capture module.  For watching TV with MPlayer, use
              'tv://' or 'tv://&lt;channel_number&gt;' or even 'tv://&lt;channel_name&gt; (see  option  channels  for  chan‐
              nel_name  below)  as  a  movie URL.  You can also use 'tv:///&lt;input_id&gt;' to start watching a movie
              from a composite or S-Video input (see option input for details).

              Available options are:

                 noaudio
                      no sound

                 automute=&lt;0-255&gt; (v4l and v4l2 only)
                      If signal strength reported by device is less than this value, audio  and  video  will  be
                      muted.  In most cases automute=100 will be enough.  Default is 0 (automute disabled).

                 driver=&lt;value&gt;
                      See  -tv  driver=help  for a list of compiled-in TV input drivers.  available: dummy, v4l,
                      v4l2, bsdbt848 (default: autodetect)

                 device=&lt;value&gt;
                      Specify TV device (default: /dev/video0).  <u>NOTE:</u> For the bsdbt848 driver you  can  provide
                      both  bktr and tuner device names separating them with a comma, tuner after bktr (e.g. -tv
                      device=/dev/bktr1,/dev/tuner1).

                 input=&lt;value&gt;
                      Specify input (default: 0 (TV), see console output for available inputs).

                 freq=&lt;value&gt;
                      Specify the frequency to set the tuner to (e.g. 511.250).  Not compatible with  the  chan‐
                      nels parameter.

                 outfmt=&lt;value&gt;
                      Specify  the  output  format  of the tuner with a preset value supported by the V4L driver
                      (yv12, rgb32, rgb24, rgb16, rgb15, uyvy, yuy2, i420) or an arbitrary format given  as  hex
                      value.  Try outfmt=help for a list of all available formats.

                 buffersize=&lt;value&gt;
                      maximum size of the capture buffer in megabytes (default: dynamical)

                 norm=&lt;value&gt;
                      For  bsdbt848  and  v4l, PAL, SECAM, NTSC are available.  For v4l2, see the console output
                      for a list of all available norms, also see the normid option below.

                 normid=&lt;value&gt; (v4l2 only)
                      Sets the TV norm to the given numeric ID.  The TV norm depends on the capture  card.   See
                      the console output for a list of available TV norms.

                 channel=&lt;value&gt;
                      Set tuner to &lt;value&gt; channel.

                      Set  names  for  channels.   <u>NOTE:</u>  If  &lt;chan&gt; is an integer greater than 1000, it will be
                      treated as frequency (in kHz) rather than channel name from frequency table.
                      Use _ for spaces in names (or play with quoting ;-).  The channel names will then be writ‐
                      ten using OSD, and the slave commands tv_step_channel, tv_set_channel and  tv_last_channel
                      will be usable for a remote control (see LIRC).  Not compatible with the frequency parame‐
                      ter.
                      <u>NOTE:</u>  The channel number will then be the position in the 'channels' list, beginning with
                      1.
                      <u>EXAMPLE:</u> tv://1, tv://TV1, tv_set_channel 1, tv_set_channel TV1

                 [brightness|contrast|hue|saturation]=&lt;-100-100&gt;
                      Set the image equalizer on the card.

                 audiorate=&lt;value&gt;
                      Set input audio sample rate.

                 forceaudio
                      Capture audio even if there are no audio sources reported by v4l.

                 alsa
                      Capture from ALSA.

                 amode=&lt;0-3&gt;
                      Choose an audio mode:
                         0: mono
                         1: stereo
                         2: language 1
                         3: language 2

                 forcechan=&lt;1-2&gt;
                      By default, the count of recorded audio channels is determined automatically  by  querying
                      the audio mode from the TV card.  This option allows forcing stereo/mono recording regard‐
                      less  of  the  amode  option  and  the values returned by v4l.  This can be used for trou‐
                      bleshooting when the TV card is unable to report the current audio mode.

                 adevice=&lt;value&gt;
                      Set an audio device.  &lt;value&gt; should be /dev/xxx for OSS and a hardware ID for ALSA.   You
                      must replace any ':' by a '.' in the hardware ID for ALSA.

                 audioid=&lt;value&gt;
                      Choose an audio output of the capture card, if it has more than one.

                 [volume|bass|treble|balance]=&lt;0-65535&gt; (v4l1)

                 [volume|bass|treble|balance]=&lt;0-100&gt; (v4l2)
                      These  options  set  parameters of the mixer on the video capture card.  They will have no
                      effect, if your card does not have one.  For v4l2 50 maps to the default value of the con‐
                      trol, as reported by the driver.

                 gain=&lt;0-100&gt; (v4l2)
                      Set gain control for video devices (usually webcams) to the desired value and  switch  off
                      automatic  control.   A  value of 0 enables automatic control.  If this option is omitted,
                      gain control will not be modified.

                 immediatemode=&lt;bool&gt;
                      A value of 0 means capture and buffer audio and video together (default for MEncoder).   A
                      value  of  1  (default  for  MPlayer)  means to do video capture only and let the audio go
                      through a loopback cable from the TV card to the sound card.

                 mjpeg
                      Use hardware MJPEG compression (if the card supports it).  When using this option, you  do
                      not need to specify the width and height of the output window, because MPlayer will deter‐
                      mine it automatically from the decimation value (see below).

                 decimation=&lt;1|2|4&gt;
                      choose the size of the picture that will be compressed by hardware MJPEG compression:
                         1: full size
                             704x576    PAL
                             704x480    NTSC
                         2: medium size
                             352x288    PAL
                             352x240    NTSC
                         4: small size
                             176x144    PAL
                             176x120    NTSC

                 quality=&lt;0-100&gt;
                      Choose the quality of the JPEG compression (&lt; 60 recommended for full size).

                 tdevice=&lt;value&gt;
                      Specify TV teletext device (example: /dev/vbi0) (default: none).

                 tformat=&lt;format&gt;
                      Specify TV teletext display format (default: 0):
                         0: opaque
                         1: transparent
                         2: opaque with inverted colors
                         3: transparent with inverted colors

                 tpage=&lt;100-899&gt;
                      Specify initial TV teletext page number (default: 100).

                 tlang=&lt;-1-127&gt;
                      Specify  default  teletext  language code (default: 0), which will be used as primary lan‐
                      guage until a type 28 packet is received.  Useful when the teletext  system  uses  a  non-
                      latin  character  set, but language codes are not transmitted via teletext type 28 packets
                      for some reason.  To see a list of supported language codes set this option to -1.

                 hidden_video_renderer (dshow only)
                      Terminate stream with video renderer instead of Null renderer (default: off).   Will  help
                      if  video  freezes  but  audio does not.  <u>NOTE:</u> May not work with -vo directx and -vf crop
                      combination.

                 hidden_vp_renderer (dshow only)
                      Terminate VideoPort pin stream with video renderer instead of removing it from  the  graph
                      (default:  off).   Useful if your card has a VideoPort pin and video is choppy.  <u>NOTE:</u> May
                      not work with -vo directx and -vf crop combination.

                 system_clock (dshow only)
                      Use the system clock as sync source instead of the default graph clock (usually the  clock
                      from one of the live sources in graph).

                 normalize_audio_chunks (dshow only)
                      Create  audio  chunks  with a time length equal to video frame time length (default: off).
                      Some audio cards create audio chunks about 0.5s in size, resulting in  choppy  video  when
                      using immediatemode=0.

       <b>-tvscan</b> <b>&lt;option1:option2:...&gt;</b> <b>(TV</b> <b>and</b> <b>MPlayer</b> <b>only)</b>
              Tune  the TV channel scanner.  MPlayer will also print value for "-tv channels=" option, including
              existing and just found channels.

              Available suboptions are:

                 autostart
                      Begin channel scanning immediately after startup (default: disabled).

                 period=&lt;0.1-2.0&gt;
                      Specify delay in seconds before switching to next channel (default:  0.5).   Lower  values
                      will cause faster scanning, but can detect inactive TV channels as active.

                 threshold=&lt;1-100&gt;
                      Threshold  value for the signal strength (in percent), as reported by the device (default:
                      50).  A signal strength higher than this value will indicate that the  currently  scanning
                      channel is active.

       <b>-user</b> <b>&lt;username&gt;</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>-passwd)</b> <b>(network</b> <b>only)</b>
              Specify username for HTTP authentication.

       <b>-user-agent</b> <b>&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Use &lt;string&gt; as user agent for HTTP streaming.

       <b>-vid</b> <b>&lt;ID&gt;</b>
              Select  video  channel (MPG: 0-15, ASF: 0-255, MPEG-TS: 17-8190).  When playing an MPEG-TS stream,
              MPlayer/MEncoder will use the first program (if present) with the chosen video stream.

       <b>-vivo</b> <b>&lt;suboption&gt;</b> <b>(DEBUG</b> <b>CODE)</b>
              Force audio parameters for the VIVO demuxer (for debugging purposes).  FIXME: Document this.

</pre><h4><b>OSD/SUBTITLE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>NOTE:</u> Also see -vf expand.

       <b>-ass</b> <b>(FreeType</b> <b>only)</b>
              Turn on SSA/ASS subtitle rendering.  With this option, libass will be used  for  SSA/ASS  external
              subtitles and Matroska tracks.  You may also want to use -embeddedfonts.
              <u>NOTE:</u> Unlike normal OSD, libass uses fontconfig by default. To disable it, use -nofontconfig.

       <b>-ass-border-color</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Sets the border (outline) color for text subtitles.  The color format is RRGGBBAA.

       <b>-ass-bottom-margin</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Adds  a  black  band  at  the bottom of the frame.  The SSA/ASS renderer can place subtitles there
              (with -ass-use-margins).

       <b>-ass-color</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Sets the color for text subtitles.  The color format is RRGGBBAA.

       <b>-ass-font-scale</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Set the scale coefficient to be used for fonts in the SSA/ASS renderer.

       <b>-ass-force-style</b> <b>&lt;[Style.]Param=Value[,...]&gt;</b>
              Override some style or script info parameters.

              Set hinting type.  &lt;type&gt; can be:
                 0    no hinting
                 1    FreeType autohinter, light mode
                 2    FreeType autohinter, normal mode
                 3    font native hinter
                 0-3 + 4
                      The same, but hinting will only be performed if the OSD is rendered at  screen  resolution
                      and will therefore not be scaled.
                 The default value is 7 (use native hinter for unscaled OSD and no hinting otherwise).

       <b>-ass-line-spacing</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Set line spacing value for SSA/ASS renderer.

       <b>-ass-styles</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Load  all  SSA/ASS  styles  found in the specified file and use them for rendering text subtitles.
              The syntax of the file is exactly like the [V4 Styles] / [V4+ Styles] section of SSA/ASS.

       <b>-ass-top-margin</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Adds a black band at the top of the frame.  The SSA/ASS renderer can place toptitles  there  (with
              -ass-use-margins).

       <b>-ass-use-margins</b>
              Enables placing toptitles and subtitles in black borders when they are available.

       <b>-dumpjacosub</b> <b>(MPlayer</b> <b>only)</b>
              Convert  the  given  subtitle  (specified with the -sub option) to the time-based JACOsub subtitle
              format.  Creates a dumpsub.js file in the current directory.

       <b>-dumpmicrodvdsub</b> <b>(MPlayer</b> <b>only)</b>
              Convert the given subtitle (specified with the -sub option) to the MicroDVD subtitle format.  Cre‐
              ates a dumpsub.sub file in the current directory.

       <b>-dumpmpsub</b> <b>(MPlayer</b> <b>only)</b>
              Convert the given subtitle (specified with the -sub option) to MPlayer's subtitle  format,  MPsub.
              Creates a dump.mpsub file in the current directory.

       <b>-dumpsami</b> <b>(MPlayer</b> <b>only)</b>
              Convert  the  given subtitle (specified with the -sub option) to the time-based SAMI subtitle for‐
              mat.  Creates a dumpsub.smi file in the current directory.

       <b>-dumpsrtsub</b> <b>(MPlayer</b> <b>only)</b>
              Convert the given subtitle (specified with the -sub option) to the time-based SubViewer (SRT) sub‐
              title format.  Creates a dumpsub.srt file in the current directory.
              <u>NOTE:</u> Some broken hardware players choke on SRT subtitle files with Unix line endings.  If you are
              unlucky enough to have such a box, pass your subtitle files through unix2dos or a similar  program
              to replace Unix line endings with DOS/Windows line endings.

       <b>-dumpsub</b> <b>(MPlayer</b> <b>only)</b> <b>(BETA</b> <b>CODE)</b>
              Dumps the subtitle substream from VOB streams.  Also see the -dump*sub and -vobsubout* options.

       <b>-embeddedfonts</b> <b>(FreeType</b> <b>only)</b>
              Enables  extraction  of  Matroska embedded fonts (default: disabled).  These fonts can be used for
              SSA/ASS subtitle rendering (-ass option).  Font files are created in the <a href="file:~/.mplayer/fonts">~/.mplayer/fonts</a> directo‐
              ry.
              <u>NOTE:</u> With FontConfig 2.4.2 or newer, embedded fonts are opened directly from memory, and this op‐
              tion is enabled by default.

       <b>-ffactor</b> <b>&lt;number&gt;</b>
              Resample the font alphamap.  Can be:
                 0    plain white fonts
                 0.75 very narrow black outline (default)
                 1    narrow black outline
                 10   bold black outline

       <b>-flip-hebrew</b> <b>(FriBiDi</b> <b>only)</b>
              Turns on flipping subtitles using FriBiDi.

       <b>-noflip-hebrew-commas</b>
              Change FriBiDi's assumptions about the placements of commas in subtitles.  Use this if  commas  in
              subtitles are shown at the start of a sentence instead of at the end.

       <b>-font</b> <b>&lt;path</b> <b>to</b> <b>font.desc</b> <b>file,</b> <b>path</b> <b>to</b> <b>font</b> <b>(FreeType),</b> <b>font</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>(Fontconfig)&gt;</b>
              Search for the OSD/subtitle fonts in an alternative directory (default for normal fonts: <a href="file:~/.mplay">~/.mplay</a>‐
              er/font/font.desc,  default  for  FreeType  fonts: <a href="file:~/.mplayer/subfont.ttf">~/.mplayer/subfont.ttf</a>, default for Fontconfig:
              "sans-serif").
              <u>NOTE:</u> With FreeType, this option determines the path to the font file.  With Fontconfig, this  op‐
              tion determines the Fontconfig font pattern.

              <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                 -font <a href="file:~/.mplayer/arial-14/font.desc">~/.mplayer/arial-14/font.desc</a>
                 -font <a href="file:~/.mplayer/arialuni.ttf">~/.mplayer/arialuni.ttf</a>
                 -font 'Bitstream Vera Sans'
                 -font 'Bitstream Vera Sans:style=Bold'

       <b>-fontconfig</b> <b>(fontconfig</b> <b>only)</b>
              Enables the usage of fontconfig managed fonts (default: autodetect).
              <u>NOTE:</u>  By  default  fontconfig  is  used  for libass-rendered subtitles and not used for OSD. With
              -fontconfig it is used for both libass and OSD, with -nofontconfig it is not used at all, i.e. on‐
              ly then -font and -subfont will work with a given path to font.

       <b>-forcedsubsonly</b>
              Display only forced subtitles for the DVD subtitle stream selected by e.g. -slang.

       <b>-fribidi-charset</b> <b>&lt;charset</b> <b>name&gt;</b> <b>(FriBiDi</b> <b>only)</b>
              Specifies the character set that will be passed to FriBiDi when decoding non-UTF-8 subtitles  (de‐
              fault: ISO8859-8).

       <b>-ifo</b> <b>&lt;VOBsub</b> <b>IFO</b> <b>file&gt;</b>
              Indicate the file that will be used to load palette and frame size for VOBsub subtitles.

       <b>-noautosub</b>
              Turns off automatic subtitle file loading.  Note: VOBsub subtitles are not affected.

       <b>-osd-duration</b> <b>&lt;time&gt;</b>
              Set the duration of the OSD messages in ms (default: 1000).

       <b>-osd-fractions</b> <b>&lt;0-2&gt;</b>
              Set how fractions of seconds of the current timestamp are printed on the OSD:
                 0    Do not display fractions (default).
                 1    Show the first two decimals.
                 2    Show approximated frame count within current second.  This frame count is not accurate but
                      only  an  approximation.   For  variable fps, the approximation is known to be far off the
                      correct frame count.

       <b>-osdlevel</b> <b>&lt;0-3&gt;</b> <b>(MPlayer</b> <b>only)</b>
              Specifies which mode the OSD should start in.
                 0    subtitles only
                 1    volume + seek (default)
                 2    volume + seek + timer + percentage
                 3    volume + seek + timer + percentage + total time

       <b>-overlapsub</b>
              Allows the next subtitle to be displayed while the current one is still visible (default is to en‐
              able the support only for specific formats).

       <b>-progbar-align</b> <b>&lt;0-100&gt;</b>
              Specify the vertical alignment of the progress bar (0: top, 100: bottom, default is 50, i.e.  cen‐
              tered).

       <b>-sid</b> <b>&lt;ID&gt;</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>-slang,</b> <b>-vobsubid)</b>
              Display  the  subtitle stream specified by &lt;ID&gt; (0-31).  MPlayer prints the available subtitle IDs
              when run in verbose (-v) mode.  If you cannot select one of the subtitles on a DVD, also try -vob‐
              subid.

       <b>-nosub</b> Disables any otherwise auto-selected internal subtitles (as e.g.  the  Matroska/mkv  demuxer  sup‐
              ports).  Use -noautosub to disable the loading of external subtitle files.

       <b>-slang</b> <b>&lt;language</b> <b>code[,language</b> <b>code,...]&gt;</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>-sid)</b>
              Specify  a priority list of subtitle languages to use.  Different container formats employ differ‐
              ent language codes.  DVDs use ISO 639-1 two letter language codes, Matroska uses ISO  639-2  three
              letter  language  codes  while OGM uses a free-form identifier.  MPlayer prints the available lan‐
              guages when run in verbose (-v) mode.

              <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                 mplayer dvd://1 -slang hu,en
                      Chooses the Hungarian subtitle track on a DVD and falls back on English  if  Hungarian  is
                      not available.
                 mplayer -slang jpn example.mkv
                      Plays a Matroska file with Japanese subtitles.

       <b>-spuaa</b> <b>&lt;mode&gt;</b>
              Antialiasing/scaling  mode for DVD/VOBsub.  A value of 16 may be added to &lt;mode&gt; in order to force
              scaling even when original and scaled frame size already match.  This  can  be  employed  to  e.g.
              smooth subtitles with gaussian blur.  Available modes are:
                 0    none (fastest, very ugly)
                 1    approximate (broken?)
                 2    full (slow)
                 3    bilinear (default, fast and not too bad)
                 4    uses swscaler gaussian blur (looks very good)

       <b>-spualign</b> <b>&lt;-1-2&gt;</b>
              Specify how SPU (DVD/VOBsub) subtitles should be aligned.
                 -1   original position
                  0   Align at top (original behavior, default).
                  1   Align at center.
                  2   Align at bottom.

       <b>-spugauss</b> <b>&lt;0.0-3.0&gt;</b>
              Variance parameter of gaussian used by -spuaa 4.  Higher means more blur (default: 1.0).

       <b>-sub</b> <b>&lt;subtitlefile1,subtitlefile2,...&gt;</b>
              Use/display these subtitle files.  Only one file can be displayed at the same time.

       <b>-sub-bg-alpha</b> <b>&lt;0-255&gt;</b>
              Specify  the  alpha  channel value for subtitles and OSD backgrounds.  Big values mean more trans‐
              parency.  0 means completely transparent.

       <b>-sub-bg-color</b> <b>&lt;0-255&gt;</b>
              Specify the color value for subtitles and OSD backgrounds.  Currently subtitles are  grayscale  so
              this value is equivalent to the intensity of the color.  255 means white and 0 black.

       <b>-sub-demuxer</b> <b>&lt;[+]name&gt;</b> <b>(-subfile</b> <b>only)</b> <b>(BETA</b> <b>CODE)</b>
              Force  subtitle  demuxer type for -subfile.  Use a '+' before the name to force it, this will skip
              some checks!  Give the demuxer name as printed by -sub-demuxer help.  For  backward  compatibility
              it also accepts the demuxer ID as defined in subreader.h.

       <b>-sub-fuzziness</b> <b>&lt;mode&gt;</b>
              Adjust matching fuzziness when searching for subtitles (does not apply to VOBsub):
                 0    exact match (default)
                 1    Load all subs containing movie name.
                 2    Load all subs in the current and -sub-paths directories.

       <b>-sub-no-text-pp</b>
              Disables  any  kind of text post processing done after loading the subtitles.  Used for debug pur‐
              poses.

       <b>-subalign</b> <b>&lt;0-2&gt;</b>
              Specify which edge of the subtitles should be aligned at the height given by -subpos.
                 0    Align subtitle top edge (original behavior).
                 1    Align subtitle center.
                 2    Align subtitle bottom edge (default).

       <b>-subcc</b> <b>&lt;1-8&gt;</b>
              Display DVD Closed Caption (CC) subtitles from the specified channel.  Values 5 to 8 select a mode
              that can extract EIA-608 compatibility streams from EIA-708 data.  These are <b>not</b>  the  VOB  subti‐
              tles,  these  are  special  ASCII  subtitles  for the hearing impaired encoded in the VOB userdata
              stream on most region 1 DVDs.  CC subtitles have not been spotted on DVDs from  other  regions  so
              far.

       <b>-subcp</b> <b>&lt;codepage&gt;</b> <b>(iconv</b> <b>only)</b>
              If  your  system  supports  <a href="../man3/iconv.3.html">iconv</a>(3), you can use this option to specify the subtitle codepage. It
              takes priority over both -utf8 and -unicode.

              <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                 -subcp latin2
                 -subcp cp1250

       <b>-subcp</b> <b>enca:&lt;language&gt;:&lt;fallback</b> <b>codepage&gt;</b> <b>(ENCA</b> <b>only)</b>
              You can specify your language using a two letter language code to make ENCA  detect  the  codepage
              automatically.   If  unsure,  enter  anything and watch mplayer -v output for available languages.
              Use __ (two underscores) if your language is not supported.  Fallback codepage specifies the code‐
              page to use, when autodetection fails.

              <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                 -subcp enca:cs:latin2
                      Guess the encoding, assuming the subtitles are Czech, fall back on latin 2, if the  detec‐
                      tion fails.
                 -subcp enca:pl:cp1250
                      Guess the encoding for Polish, fall back on cp1250.
                 -subcp enca:__:latin1
                      Generic detection (mostly unicode) with latin1 fallback.

       <b>-sub-paths</b> <b>&lt;path1,path2,...&gt;</b>
              Specify extra subtitle paths to track in the media directory.

              <u>EXAMPLE:</u>  Assuming  that /path/to/movie/movie.avi is played and -sub-paths sub,subtitles,/tmp/subs
              is specified, MPlayer searches for subtitle files in these directories:
                 /path/to/movie/
                 /path/to/movie/sub/
                 /path/to/movie/subtitles/
                 /tmp/subs/
                 <a href="file:~/.mplayer/sub/">~/.mplayer/sub/</a>

       <b>-subdelay</b> <b>&lt;sec&gt;</b>
              Delays subtitles by &lt;sec&gt; seconds.  Can be negative.

       <b>-subfile</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> <b>(BETA</b> <b>CODE)</b>
              Currently useless.  Same as -audiofile, but for subtitle streams (OggDS?).

       <b>-subfont</b> <b>&lt;path</b> <b>to</b> <b>font</b> <b>(FreeType),</b> <b>font</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>(Fontconfig)&gt;</b> <b>(FreeType</b> <b>only)</b>
              Sets the subtitle font (see -font).  If no -subfont is given, -font is used.

       <b>-subfont-autoscale</b> <b>&lt;0-3&gt;</b> <b>(FreeType</b> <b>only)</b>
              Sets the autoscale mode.
              <u>NOTE:</u> 0 means that text scale and OSD scale are font heights in points.

              The mode can be:

                 0    no autoscale
                 1    proportional to movie height
                 2    proportional to movie width
                 3    proportional to movie diagonal (default)

       <b>-subfont-blur</b> <b>&lt;0-8&gt;</b> <b>(FreeType</b> <b>only)</b>
              Sets the font blur radius (default: 2).

       <b>-subfont-encoding</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Sets the font encoding.  When set to 'unicode', all the glyphs from the font file will be rendered
              and unicode will be used (default: unicode). (Without FreeType, setting any other value than 'uni‐
              code' will disable unicode glyphs rendering for font.desc files. With FreeType and for other  val‐
              ues than 'unicode' your system has to support <a href="../man3/iconv.3.html">iconv</a>(3) in order for this to work.)

       <b>-subfont-osd-scale</b> <b>&lt;0-100&gt;</b> <b>(FreeType</b> <b>only)</b>
              Sets the autoscale coefficient of the OSD elements (default: 6).

       <b>-subfont-outline</b> <b>&lt;0-8&gt;</b> <b>(FreeType</b> <b>only)</b>
              Sets the font outline thickness (default: 2).

       <b>-subfont-text-scale</b> <b>&lt;0-100&gt;</b> <b>(FreeType</b> <b>only)</b>
              Sets the subtitle text autoscale coefficient as percentage of the screen size (default: 5).

       <b>-subfps</b> <b>&lt;rate&gt;</b>
              Specify the framerate of the subtitle file (default: movie fps).
              <u>NOTE:</u>  &lt;rate&gt;  &gt;  movie  fps speeds the subtitles up for frame-based subtitle files and slows them
              down for time-based ones.

       <b>-subpos</b> <b>&lt;0-150&gt;</b> <b>(useful</b> <b>with</b> <b>-vf</b> <b>expand)</b>
              Specify the position of subtitles on the screen.  The value is the vertical position of the subti‐
              tle in % of the screen height.  Values larger than 100 allow part of the subtitle to be cut off.

       <b>-subwidth</b> <b>&lt;10-100&gt;</b>
              Specify the maximum width of subtitles on the screen.  Useful for TV-out.  The value is the  width
              of the subtitle in % of the screen width.

       <b>-noterm-osd</b>
              Disable the display of OSD messages on the console when no video output is available.

       <b>-term-osd-esc</b> <b>&lt;escape</b> <b>sequence&gt;</b>
              Specify  the  escape sequence to use before writing an OSD message on the console.  The escape se‐
              quence should move the pointer to the beginning of the line used for the OSD  and  clear  it  (de‐
              fault: ^[[A\r^[[K).

       <b>-unicode</b>
              Tells  MPlayer to handle the subtitle file as unicode. (It will only take effect if neither -subcp
              nor -utf8 is given.)

       <b>-unrarexec</b> <b>&lt;path</b> <b>to</b> <b>unrar</b> <b>executable&gt;</b> <b>(not</b> <b>supported</b> <b>on</b> <b>MingW)</b>
              Specify the path to the unrar executable so MPlayer can use it  to  access  rar-compressed  VOBsub
              files (default: not set, so the feature is off).  The path must include the executable's filename,
              i.e. /usr/local/bin/unrar.

       <b>-utf8</b>
              Tells MPlayer to handle the subtitle file as UTF-8. (It will only take effect if -subcp isn't giv‐

       <b>-abs</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b> <b>(-ao</b> <b>oss</b> <b>only)</b> <b>(OBSOLETE)</b>
              Override audio driver/card buffer size detection.

       <b>-format</b> <b>&lt;format&gt;</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>format</b> <b>audio</b> <b>filter)</b>
              Select the sample format used for output from the audio filter layer to the sound card.  The  val‐
              ues that &lt;format&gt; can adopt are listed below in the description of the format audio filter.

       <b>-mixer</b> <b>&lt;device&gt;</b>
              Use a mixer device different from the default /dev/mixer.  For ALSA this is the mixer name.

       <b>-mixer-channel</b> <b>&lt;mixer</b> <b>line&gt;[,mixer</b> <b>index]</b> <b>(-ao</b> <b>oss</b> <b>and</b> <b>-ao</b> <b>alsa</b> <b>only)</b>
              This  option  will tell MPlayer to use a different channel for controlling volume than the default
              PCM.  Options for OSS include <b>vol,</b> <b>pcm,</b> <b>line.</b>  For a complete list of options look  for  SOUND_DE‐
              VICE_NAMES  in /usr/include/linux/soundcard.h.  For ALSA you can use the names e.g. alsamixer dis‐
              plays, like <b>Master,</b> <b>Line,</b> <b>PCM.</b>
              <u>NOTE:</u> ALSA mixer channel names followed by a number must be specified in the &lt;name,number&gt; format,
              i.e. a channel labeled 'PCM 1' in alsamixer must be converted to <b>PCM,1</b>.

       <b>-softvol</b>
              Force the use of the software mixer, instead of using the sound card mixer.

       <b>-softvol-max</b> <b>&lt;10.0-10000.0&gt;</b>
              Set the maximum amplification level in percent (default: 110).  A value of 200 will allow  you  to
              adjust  the volume up to a maximum of double the current level.  With values below 100 the initial
              volume (which is 100%) will be above the maximum, which e.g. the OSD cannot display correctly.

       <b>-volstep</b> <b>&lt;0-100&gt;</b>
              Set the step size of mixer volume changes in percent of the whole range (default: 3).

       <b>-volume</b> <b>&lt;-1-100&gt;</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>-af</b> <b>volume)</b>
              Set the startup volume in the mixer, either hardware or software (if used with -softvol).  A value
              of -1 (the default) will not change the volume.

</pre><h4><b>AUDIO</b> <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>DRIVERS</b> <b>(MPLAYER</b> <b>ONLY)</b></h4><pre>
       Audio output drivers are interfaces to different audio output facilities.  The syntax is:

       <b>-ao</b> <b>&lt;driver1[:suboption1[=value]:...],driver2,...[,]&gt;</b>
              Specify a priority list of audio output drivers to be used.

       If the list has a trailing ',' MPlayer will fall back on drivers not contained in the  list.   Suboptions
       are optional and can mostly be omitted.
       <u>NOTE:</u> See -ao help for a list of compiled-in audio output drivers.

       <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                 -ao alsa,oss,
                      Try the ALSA driver, then the OSS driver, then others.
                 -ao alsa:noblock:device=hw=0.3
                      Sets noblock-mode and the device-name as first card, fourth device.

       Available audio output drivers are:

       <b>alsa</b>
              ALSA 0.9/1.x audio output driver
                 noblock
                      Sets noblock-mode.
                 device=&lt;device&gt;
                      Sets  the  device  name.  Replace any ',' with '.' and any ':' with '=' in the ALSA device
                      name.  For hwac3 output via S/PDIF, use an "iec958" or "spdif" device, unless  you  really
                      know how to set it correctly.

       <b>oss</b>
              OSS audio output driver
                 &lt;dsp-device&gt;
                      Sets the audio output device (default: /dev/dsp).
                 &lt;mixer-device&gt;
                      Sets the audio mixer device (default: /dev/mixer).
                 &lt;mixer-channel&gt;
                      Sets the audio mixer channel (default: pcm).

       <b>sdl</b> <b>(SDL</b> <b>only)</b>
              highly platform independent SDL (Simple Directmedia Layer) library audio output driver
                 &lt;driver&gt;
                      Explicitly choose the SDL audio driver to use (default: let SDL choose).

       <b>arts</b>
              audio output through the aRts daemon

       <b>esd</b>
              audio output through the ESD daemon
                 &lt;server&gt;
                      Explicitly choose the ESD server to use (default: localhost).

       <b>jack</b>
              audio output through JACK (Jack Audio Connection Kit)
                 (no)connect
                      Automatically  create  connections  to output ports (default: enabled).  When enabled, the
                      maximum number of output channels will be limited to the number of available output ports.
                 port=&lt;name&gt;
                      Connects to the ports with the given name (default: physical ports).
                 name=&lt;client
                      Client name that is passed to JACK (default: MPlayer [&lt;PID&gt;]).  Useful if you want to have
                      certain connections established automatically.
                 (no)estimate
                      Estimate the audio delay, supposed to make the video playback smoother (default: enabled).
                 (no)autostart
                      Automatically start jackd if necessary (default: disabled).  Note that this seems  unreli‐
                      able and will spam stdout with server messages.

       <b>nas</b>
              audio output through NAS

       <b>coreaudio</b> <b>(Mac</b> <b>OS</b> <b>X</b> <b>only)</b>

                      Specify  the  host and optionally output sink to use.  An empty &lt;host&gt; string uses a local
                      connection, "localhost" uses network transfer (most likely not what you  want).   You  can
                      also  explicitly force the workaround for broken pause functionality (default: autodetect‐
                      ed).  To only enable that without specifying a host/sink the syntax  is  -ao  pulse:::bro‐
                      ken_pause

       <b>sgi</b> <b>(SGI</b> <b>only)</b>
              native SGI audio output driver
                 &lt;output device name&gt;

                      Use the _NETWM_STATE_ABOVE hint if available.
                 below
                      Use the _NETWM_STATE_BELOW hint if available.
                 fullscreen
                      Use the _NETWM_STATE_FULLSCREEN hint if available.
                 layer
                      Use the _WIN_LAYER hint with the default layer.
                 layer=&lt;0...15&gt;
                      Use the _WIN_LAYER hint with the given layer number.
                 netwm
                      Force NETWM style.
                 none
                      Clear the list of modes; you can add modes to enable afterward.
                 stays_on_top
                      Use _NETWM_STATE_STAYS_ON_TOP hint if available.

              <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                 layer,stays_on_top,above,fullscreen
                      Default order, will be used as a fallback if incorrect or unsupported modes are specified.
                 -fullscreen
                      Fixes fullscreen switching on OpenBox 1.x.

       <b>-fs-border-left</b> <b>&lt;pixels&gt;</b>

       <b>-fs-border-right</b> <b>&lt;pixels&gt;</b>

       <b>-fs-border-top</b> <b>&lt;pixels&gt;</b>

       <b>-fs-border-bottom</b> <b>&lt;pixels&gt;</b>
              Specify  extra  borders  in full screen mode.  The borders apply to all displayed elements: video,
              OSD and EOSD.  The number of pixels is specified in terms of screen  resolution.   Currently  only
              supported with by the gl video output driver.

       <b>-gamma</b> <b>&lt;-100-100&gt;</b>
              Adjust the gamma of the video signal (default: 0).  Not supported by all video output drivers.

       <b>-geometry</b> <b>x[%][:y[%]]</b> <b>or</b> <b>[WxH][+-x+-y]</b>
              Adjust where the output is on the screen initially.  The x and y specifications are in pixels mea‐
              sured  from  the top-left of the screen to the top-left of the image being displayed, however if a
              percentage sign is given after the argument it turns the value into a  percentage  of  the  screen
              size  in that direction.  It also supports the standard X11 -geometry option format, in which e.g.
              +10-50 means "place 10 pixels from the left border and  50  pixels  from  the  lower  border"  and
              "--20+-10"  means  "place  20 pixels beyond the right and 10 pixels beyond the top border".  If an
              external window is specified using the -wid option, then the x and y coordinates are  relative  to
              the  top-left  corner  of  the window rather than the screen.  The coordinates are relative to the
              screen given with -screen for the video output drivers that fully support -screen  (direct3d,  gl,
              gl_tiled, vdpau, x11, xv, corevideo).
              <u>NOTE:</u> This option is only supported by the x11, xmga, xv, xvidix, gl, gl_tiled, direct3d, directx,
              fbdev, sdl, dfxfb and corevideo video output drivers.

              <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                 50:40
                      Places the window at x=50, y=40.
                 50%:50%
                      Places the window in the middle of the screen.
                 100%
                      Places the window at the middle of the right edge of the screen.
                 100%:100%
                      Places the window at the bottom right corner of the screen.

       <b>-gui-wid</b> <b>&lt;window</b> <b>ID&gt;</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>-wid)</b> <b>(GUI</b> <b>only)</b>
              This tells the GUI to also use an X11 window and stick itself to the bottom of the video, which is
              useful to embed a mini-GUI in a browser (with the MPlayer plugin for instance).

       <b>-hue</b> <b>&lt;-100-100&gt;</b>
              Adjust the hue of the video signal (default: 0).  You can get a colored negative of the image with
              this option.  Not supported by all video output drivers.

       <b>-monitor-dotclock</b> <b>&lt;range[,range,...]&gt;</b> <b>(-vo</b> <b>fbdev</b> <b>and</b> <b>vesa</b> <b>only)</b>
              Specify the dotclock or pixelclock range of the monitor.

       <b>-monitor-hfreq</b> <b>&lt;range[,range,...]&gt;</b> <b>(-vo</b> <b>fbdev</b> <b>and</b> <b>vesa</b> <b>only)</b>
              Specify the horizontal frequency range of the monitor.

       <b>-monitor-vfreq</b> <b>&lt;range[,range,...]&gt;</b> <b>(-vo</b> <b>fbdev</b> <b>and</b> <b>vesa</b> <b>only)</b>
              Specify the vertical frequency range of the monitor.

       <b>-monitoraspect</b> <b>&lt;ratio&gt;</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>-aspect)</b>
              Set the aspect ratio of your monitor or TV screen.  A value of 0 disables a previous setting (e.g.
              in the config file).  Overrides the -monitorpixelaspect setting if enabled.

              <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                 -monitoraspect 4:3  or 1.3333
                 -monitoraspect 16:9 or 1.7777

       <b>-monitorpixelaspect</b> <b>&lt;ratio&gt;</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>-aspect)</b>
              Set  the  aspect  of a single pixel of your monitor or TV screen (default: 1).  A value of 1 means
              square pixels (correct for (almost?) all LCDs).

       <b>-name</b> <b>(X11</b> <b>only)</b>
              Set the window class name.

       <b>-nodouble</b>
              Disables double buffering, mostly for debugging purposes.  Double buffering fixes flicker by stor‐
              ing two frames in memory, and displaying one while decoding another.  It can affect OSD  negative‐
              ly, but often removes OSD flickering.

       <b>-nograbpointer</b>
              Do not grab the mouse pointer after a video mode change (-vm).  Useful for multihead setups.

       <b>-nokeepaspect</b>
              Do not keep window aspect ratio when resizing windows.  Only works with the x11, xv, xmga, xvidix,
              directx  video  output drivers.  Furthermore under X11 your window manager has to honor window as‐
              pect hints.

       <b>-ontop</b>
              Makes the player window stay on top of other windows.  Supported by video output drivers which use
              X11, except SDL, as well as directx, corevideo, quartz, ggi and gl_tiled.

       <b>-panscan</b> <b>&lt;0.0-1.0&gt;</b>
              Enables pan-and-scan functionality (cropping the sides of e.g. a 16:9 movie to make it fit  a  4:3
              display  without  black  bands).  The range controls how much of the image is cropped.  Only works
              with the directx, xv, xmga, mga, gl, gl_tiled, quartz, corevideo and xvidix video output drivers.
              <u>NOTE:</u> Values between -1 and 0 are allowed as well, but highly experimental and may crash or worse.
              Use at your own risk!

       <b>-panscanrange</b> <b>&lt;-19.0-99.0&gt;</b> <b>(experimental)</b>
              Change the range of the pan-and-scan functionality (default: 1).  Positive values  mean  multiples
              of  the  default  range.  Negative numbers mean you can zoom in up to a factor of -panscanrange+1.
              E.g. -panscanrange -3 allows a zoom factor of up to 4.  This feature is experimental.

       <b>-border-pos-x</b> <b>&lt;0.0-1.0&gt;</b> <b>(-vo</b> <b>gl,xv,vdpau,direct3d</b> <b>only,</b> <b>default</b> <b>0.5)</b>
              When black borders are added to adjust for aspect, this determines where  they  are  placed.   0.0
              places  borders  on the right, 1.0 on the left.  Values outside the range 0.0 - 1.0 will add extra
              black borders on one side and remove part of the image on the other side.

       <b>-border-pos-y</b> <b>&lt;0.0-1.0&gt;</b> <b>(-vo</b> <b>gl,xv,vdpau,direct3d</b> <b>only,</b> <b>default</b> <b>0.5)</b>
              As -border-pos-x but for top/bottom borders.  0.0 places borders on the bottom, 1.0 on the top.

       <b>-monitor-orientation</b> <b>&lt;0-3&gt;</b> <b>(experimental)</b>
              Rotate display by 90, 180 or 270 degrees.  Rotates also the OSD, not just the video image  itself.
              Currently  only  supported by the gl video output driver.  For all other video outputs -vf ass,ex‐
              pand=osd=1,rotate=n can be used, in the future this might even happen automatically.

       <b>-refreshrate</b> <b>&lt;Hz&gt;</b>
              Set the monitor refreshrate in Hz.  Currently only supported by -vo directx combined with the  -vm
              option.

       <b>-rootwin</b>
              Play movie in the root window (desktop background).  Desktop background images may cover the movie
              window,  though.   Only  works with the x11, xv, xmga, xvidix, quartz, corevideo and directx video
              output drivers.

       <b>-saturation</b> <b>&lt;-100-100&gt;</b>
              Adjust the saturation of the video signal (default: 0).  You can get grayscale  output  with  this
              option.  Not supported by all video output drivers.

       <b>-screenh</b> <b>&lt;pixels&gt;</b>
              Specify  the  screen  height for video output drivers which do not know the screen resolution like
              fbdev, x11 and TV-out.

       <b>-screenw</b> <b>&lt;pixels&gt;</b>
              Specify the screen width for video output drivers which do not know the screen resolution like fb‐
              dev, x11 and TV-out.

       <b>-(no)stop-xscreensaver</b> <b>(X11</b> <b>only)</b>
              Turns off xscreensaver at startup and turns it on again  on  exit  (default:  enabled).   If  your
              screensaver supports neither the XSS nor XResetScreenSaver API please use -heartbeat-cmd instead.

       <b>-title</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>-use-filename-title)</b>
              Set the window title.  Supported by X11-based video output drivers.

       <b>-use-filename-title</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>-title)</b>
              Set  the  window title using the media filename, when not set with -title.  Supported by X11-based
              video output drivers.

       <b>-vm</b>
              Try to change to a different video mode.  Supported by the dga, x11, xv,  sdl  and  directx  video
              output  drivers.   If  used  with the directx video output driver the -screenw, -screenh, -bpp and
              -refreshrate options can be used to set the new display mode.

       <b>-vsync</b>
              Enables VBI for the vesa, dfbmga and svga video output drivers.

       <b>-wid</b> <b>&lt;window</b> <b>ID&gt;</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>-gui-wid)</b> <b>(X11,</b> <b>OpenGL</b> <b>and</b> <b>DirectX</b> <b>only)</b>
              This tells MPlayer to attach to an existing window.  Useful to embed MPlayer in  a  browser  (e.g.
              the  plugger extension).  This option fills the given window completely, thus aspect scaling, pan‐
              scan, etc are no longer handled by MPlayer but must be managed by the application that created the
              window.

       <b>-screen</b> <b>&lt;-2-...&gt;</b> <b>(alias</b> <b>for</b> <b>-xineramascreen)</b>
              In Xinerama configurations (i.e. a single desktop that spans across multiple displays) this option
              tells MPlayer which screen to display the movie on.  A value of -2  means  fullscreen  across  the
              whole  virtual  display  (in  this  case  Xinerama  information  is  completely ignored), -1 means
              fullscreen on the display the window currently is on.  The initial position set via the  -geometry
              option  is relative to the specified screen.  Will usually only work with "-fstype -fullscreen" or
              "-fstype none".  This option is not suitable to only set the startup screen (because it  will  al‐
              ways  display on the given screen in fullscreen mode), -geometry is the best that is available for
              that purpose currently.  Supported by at least the direct3d, gl, gl_tiled, x11, xv  and  corevideo
              video output drivers.

       <b>-zrbw</b> <b>(-vo</b> <b>zr</b> <b>only)</b>
              Display in black and white.  For optimal performance, this can be combined with '-lavdopts gray'.

       <b>-zrcrop</b> <b>&lt;[width]x[height]+[x</b> <b>offset]+[y</b> <b>offset]&gt;</b> <b>(-vo</b> <b>zr</b> <b>only)</b>
              Select a part of the input image to display, multiple occurrences of this option switch on cinera‐
              ma  mode.  In cinerama mode the movie is distributed over more than one TV (or beamer) to create a
              larger image.  Options appearing after the n-th -zrcrop apply to the n-th MJPEG  card,  each  card
              should at least have a -zrdev in addition to the -zrcrop.  For examples, see the output of -zrhelp
              and the Zr section of the documentation.

       <b>-zrdev</b> <b>&lt;device&gt;</b> <b>(-vo</b> <b>zr</b> <b>only)</b>
              Specify  the  device  special file that belongs to your MJPEG card, by default the zr video output
              driver takes the first v4l device it can find.

       <b>-zrfd</b> <b>(-vo</b> <b>zr</b> <b>only)</b>
              Force decimation: Decimation, as specified by -zrhdec and -zrvdec, only happens  if  the  hardware
              scaler can stretch the image to its original size.  Use this option to force decimation.

       <b>-zrhdec</b> <b>&lt;1|2|4&gt;</b> <b>(-vo</b> <b>zr</b> <b>only)</b>
              Horizontal  decimation: Ask the driver to send only every 2nd or 4th line/pixel of the input image
              to the MJPEG card and use the scaler of the MJPEG card to stretch the image to its original size.

       <b>-zrhelp</b> <b>(-vo</b> <b>zr</b> <b>only)</b>
              Display a list of all -zr* options, their default values and a cinerama mode example.

       <b>-zrnorm</b> <b>&lt;norm&gt;</b> <b>(-vo</b> <b>zr</b> <b>only)</b>
              Specify the TV norm as PAL or NTSC (default: no change).

       <b>-zrquality</b> <b>&lt;1-20&gt;</b> <b>(-vo</b> <b>zr</b> <b>only)</b>
              A number from 1 (best) to 20 (worst) representing the JPEG encoding quality.

       <b>-zrvdec</b> <b>&lt;1|2|4&gt;</b> <b>(-vo</b> <b>zr</b> <b>only)</b>
              Vertical decimation: Ask the driver to send only every 2nd or 4th line/pixel of the input image to
              the MJPEG card and use the scaler of the MJPEG card to stretch the image to its original size.

       <b>-zrxdoff</b> <b>&lt;x</b> <b>display</b> <b>offset&gt;</b> <b>(-vo</b> <b>zr</b> <b>only)</b>
              If the movie is smaller than the TV screen, this option specifies the x offset from the upper-left
              corner of the TV screen (default: centered).

       <b>-zrydoff</b> <b>&lt;y</b> <b>display</b> <b>offset&gt;</b> <b>(-vo</b> <b>zr</b> <b>only)</b>
              If the movie is smaller than the TV screen, this option specifies the y offset from the upper-left
              corner of the TV screen (default: centered).

</pre><h4><b>VIDEO</b> <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>DRIVERS</b> <b>(MPLAYER</b> <b>ONLY)</b></h4><pre>
       Video output drivers are interfaces to different video output facilities.  The syntax is:

       <b>-vo</b> <b>&lt;driver1[:suboption1[=value]:...],driver2,...[,]&gt;</b>
              Specify a priority list of video output drivers to be used.

       If the list has a trailing ',' MPlayer will fall back on drivers not contained in the  list.   Suboptions
       are optional and can mostly be omitted.
       <u>NOTE:</u> See -vo help for a list of compiled-in video output drivers.

       <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                 -vo xmga,xv,
                      Try the Matrox X11 driver, then the Xv driver, then others.
                 -vo directx:noaccel
                      Uses the DirectX driver with acceleration features turned off.

       Available video output drivers are:

       <b>xv</b> <b>(X11</b> <b>only)</b>
              Uses  the  XVideo extension of XFree86 4.x to enable hardware accelerated playback.  If you cannot
              use a hardware specific driver, this is probably the best option.  For information about what col‐
              orkey is used and how it is drawn run MPlayer with -v option and look out  for  the  lines  tagged
              with [xv common] at the beginning.
                 adaptor=&lt;number&gt;
                      Select a specific XVideo adaptor (check xvinfo results).
                 port=&lt;number&gt;
                      Select a specific XVideo port.
                 ck=&lt;cur|use|set&gt;
                      Select the source from which the colorkey is taken (default: cur).
                         cur  The default takes the colorkey currently set in Xv.
                         use  Use but do not set the colorkey from MPlayer (use -colorkey option to change it).
                         set  Same as use but also sets the supplied colorkey.
                 ck-method=&lt;man|bg|auto&gt;
                      Sets the colorkey drawing method (default: man).
                         man  Draw the colorkey manually (reduces flicker in some cases).
                         bg   Set the colorkey as window background.
                         auto Let Xv draw the colorkey.

       <b>x11</b> <b>(X11</b> <b>only)</b>
              Shared  memory  video  output  driver  without  hardware  acceleration  that works whenever X11 is

              Video output that uses VDPAU to decode video via hardware.  Also supports displaying of  software-
              decoded video.
                 sharpen=&lt;-1-1&gt;
                      For  positive  values,  apply  a  sharpening algorithm to the video, for negative values a

                         3    motion adaptive temporal deinterlacing May lead to  A/V  desync  with  slow  video
                              hardware  and/or  high  resolution.   This is the default if "D" is used to enable
                              deinterlacing.
                         4    motion adaptive temporal  deinterlacing  with  edge-guided  spatial  interpolation
                              Needs fast video hardware.
                 chroma-deint
                      Makes  temporal  deinterlacers  operate  both  on  luma and chroma (default).  Use nochro‐
                      ma-deint to solely use luma and speed up advanced deinterlacing.  Useful with  slow  video
                      memory.
                 pullup
                      Try  to  skip deinterlacing for progressive frames, useful for watching telecined content,
                      needs fast video hardware for high resolutions.  Only works with motion adaptive  temporal
                      deinterlacing.
                 colorspace
                      Select  the  color  space for YUV to RGB conversion.  In general BT.601 should be used for
                      standard definition (SD) content and BT.709 for high definition (HD) content.   Using  in‐
                      correct color space results in slightly under or over saturated and shifted colors.
                         0    Guess  the  color  space  based  on video resolution.  Video with width &gt;= 1280 or
                              height &gt; 576 is assumed to be HD and BT.709 color space will be used.
                         1    Use ITU-R BT.601 color space (default).
                         2    Use ITU-R BT.709 color space.
                         3    Use SMPTE-240M color space.
                 hqscaling
                         0    Use default VDPAU scaling (default).
                         1-9  Apply high quality VDPAU scaling (needs capable hardware).
                 force-mixer
                      Forces the use of the VDPAU mixer, which implements all above options (default).  Use  no‐
                      force-mixer  to  allow  displaying  BGRA  colorspace.  (Disables all above options and the
                      hardware equalizer if image format BGRA is actually used.)

       <b>gl</b>
              OpenGL  video  output driver, simple version.  Video size must be smaller than the maximum texture
              size of your OpenGL implementation.  Intended to work even with the most basic OpenGL  implementa‐
              tions, but also makes use of newer extensions, which allow support for more colorspaces and direct
              rendering.  For optimal speed try adding the options
              -dr -noslices
              The  code performs very few checks, so if a feature does not work, this might be because it is not
              supported by your card/OpenGL implementation even if you do not get any error message.  Use glxin‐
              fo or a similar tool to display the supported OpenGL extensions.
                 backend=&lt;n&gt;
                      Select the backend/OpenGL implementation to use (default: -1).
                         -1: Autoselect
                         0: Win32/WGL
                         1: X11/GLX
                         2: SDL
                         3: X11/EGL (highly experimental)
                         4: OSX/Cocoa
                         5: Android (very bad hack, only for testing)
                 (no)ati-hack
                      ATI drivers may give a corrupted image when PBOs are used (when using -dr  or  force-pbo).
                      This option fixes this, at the expense of using a bit more memory.
                 (no)force-pbo
                      Always uses PBOs to transfer textures even if this involves an extra copy.  Currently this
                      gives a little extra speed with NVidia drivers and a lot more speed with ATI drivers.  May
                      need -noslices and the ati-hack suboption to work correctly.
                 (no)scaled-osd
                      Changes  the  way the OSD behaves when the size of the window changes (default: disabled).
                      When enabled behaves more like the other video output drivers, which is better for  fixed-
                      size  fonts.   Disabled  looks  much  better  with  FreeType fonts and uses the borders in
                      fullscreen mode.  Does not work correctly with ass subtitles (see -ass), you  can  instead
                      render them without OpenGL support via -vf ass.
                 osdcolor=&lt;0xAARRGGBB&gt;
                      Color for OSD (default: 0x00ffffff, corresponds to non-transparent white).
                 rectangle=&lt;0,1,2&gt;
                      Select  usage of rectangular textures which saves video RAM, but often is slower (default:
                      0).
                         0: Use power-of-two textures (default).
                         1: Use the GL_ARB_texture_rectangle extension.
                         2: Use the GL_ARB_texture_non_power_of_two extension.  In some cases only supported  in
                         software and thus very slow.
                 swapinterval=&lt;n&gt;
                      Minimum interval between two buffer swaps, counted in displayed frames (default: 1).  1 is
                      equivalent  to  enabling VSYNC, 0 to disabling VSYNC.  Values below 0 will leave it at the
                      system default.  This limits the framerate to (horizontal refresh  rate  /  n).   Requires
                      GLX_SGI_swap_control  support  to  work.   With some (most/all?) implementations this only
                      works in fullscreen mode.
                 ycbcr
                      Use the GL_APPLE_ycbcr_422 extension to convert YUV to RGB.  Default is disabled  if  yuv=
                      is  specified, auto-detected otherwise.  Note that this will enable a few special settings
                      to get into a special driver fast-path.
                 yuv=&lt;n&gt;
                      Select the type of YUV to RGB conversion.  The default is auto-detection deciding  between
                      values 0 and 2.
                         0: Use software conversion.  Compatible with all OpenGL versions.  Provides brightness,
                         contrast and saturation control.
                         1: Use register combiners.  This uses an nVidia-specific extension (GL_NV_register_com‐
                         biners).   At  least  three texture units are needed.  Provides saturation and hue con‐
                         trol.  This method is fast but inexact.
                         2: Use a fragment program using the POW instruction.  Needs the GL_ARB_fragment_program
                         extension and at least three texture units.  Provides brightness, contrast, saturation,
                         hue and gamma control.  Gamma can also be set independently for red,  green  and  blue.
                         Method 4 is usually faster.
                         3:  Same  as  2.  They exist as distinct values for legacy reasons, MPlayer now inserts
                         the extra instructions for gamma control on-demand.
                         4: Use a fragment program with additional lookup.   Needs  the  GL_ARB_fragment_program
                         extension  and at least four texture units.  Provides brightness, contrast, saturation,
                         hue and gamma control.  Gamma can also be set independently for red, green and blue.
                         5: Use ATI-specific method (for older cards).   This  uses  an  ATI-specific  extension
                         (GL_ATI_fragment_shader  -  not GL_ARB_fragment_shader!).  At least three texture units
                         are needed.  Provides saturation and hue control.  This method is fast but inexact.
                         6: Use a 3D texture to do conversion via lookup.  Needs the GL_ARB_fragment_program ex‐
                         tension and at least four texture units.  Extremely slow (software emulation)  on  some
                         (all?) ATI cards since it uses a texture with border pixels.  Provides brightness, con‐
                         trast, saturation, hue and gamma control.  Gamma can also be set independently for red,
                         green and blue.  Speed depends more on GPU memory bandwidth than other methods.
                 colorspace
                      Select the color space for YUV to RGB conversion.
                         0    Use the formula used normally by MPlayer (default).
                         1    Use ITU-R BT.601 color space.
                         2    Use ITU-R BT.709 color space.
                         3    Use SMPTE-240M color space.
                 levelconv=&lt;n&gt;
                      Select the brightness level conversion to use for the YUV to RGB conversion
                         0    Convert TV to PC levels (default).
                         1    Convert PC to TV levels.
                         2    Do not do any conversion.
                 lscale=&lt;n&gt;
                      Select  the scaling function to use for luminance scaling.  Only valid for yuv modes 2, 3,
                      4 and 6.
                         0    Use simple linear filtering (default).
                         1    Use bicubic B-spline filtering (better quality).   Needs  one  additional  texture
                              unit.   Older  cards  will  not  be  able  to  handle  this for chroma at least in
                              fullscreen mode.
                         2    Use cubic filtering in horizontal, linear filtering in vertical direction.   Works
                              on a few more cards than method 1.
                         3    Same as 1 but does not use a lookup texture.  Might be faster on some cards.
                         4    Use  experimental  unsharp  masking with 3x3 support and a default strength of 0.5
                              (see filter-strength).
                         5    Use experimental unsharp masking with 5x5 support and a default  strength  of  0.5
                              (see filter-strength).
                         64   Use nearest-neighbor scaling.
                 cscale=&lt;n&gt;
                      Select the scaling function to use for chrominance scaling.  For details see lscale.
                 filter-strength=&lt;value&gt;
                      Set the effect strength for the lscale/cscale filters that support it.
                 noise-strength=&lt;value&gt;
                      Set how much noise to add. 0 to disable (default), 1.0 for level suitable for dithering to
                      6 bit.
                 stereo=&lt;value&gt;
                      Select  a method for stereo display.  You may have to use -aspect to fix the aspect value.
                      Add 32 to swap left and right side.  Experimental, do not expect too much from it.
                         0    normal 2D display
                         1    Convert side by side input to full-color red-cyan stereo.
                         2    Convert side by side input to full-color green-magenta stereo.
                         3    Convert side by side input to quadbuffered stereo.  Only  supported  by  very  few
                              OpenGL cards.
                         4    Mix left and right in a pixel pattern.  Pattern is given by stipple option.
                 stipple=&lt;bit
                      Lowest  16  bit  give  the 4x4 pattern to use (default: 0x0f0f).  Examples to try: 0x0f0f,
                      0xf0f0: horizontal lines; 0xaaaa, 0x5555: vertical  lines;  0xa5a5,  0x5a5a:  checkerboard
                      pattern

              The following options are only useful if writing your own fragment programs.

                 customprog=&lt;filename&gt;
                      Load a custom fragment program from &lt;filename&gt;.  See TOOLS/edgedect.fp for an example.
                 customtex=&lt;filename&gt;
                      Load  a custom "gamma ramp" texture from &lt;filename&gt;.  This can be used in combination with
                      yuv=4 or with the customprog option.
                 (no)customtlin
                      If enabled (default) use GL_LINEAR interpolation, otherwise use GL_NEAREST  for  customtex
                      texture.
                 (no)customtrect
                      If enabled, use texture_rectangle for customtex texture.  Default is disabled.
                 (no)mipmapgen
                      If  enabled, mipmaps for the video are automatically generated.  This should be useful to‐
                      gether with the customprog and the TXB instruction to implement blur filters with a  large
                      radius.   For  most OpenGL implementations this is very slow for any non-RGB formats.  De‐
                      fault is disabled.

              Normally there is no reason to use the following options, they mostly exist for testing purposes.

                 (no)glfinish
                      Call glFinish() before swapping buffers.  Slower but in some  cases  more  correct  output
                      (default: disabled).
                 (no)manyfmts
                      Enables  support  for  more  (RGB and BGR) color formats (default: enabled).  Needs OpenGL
                      version &gt;= 1.2.
                 slice-height=&lt;0-...&gt;
                      Number of lines copied to texture in one piece (default: 0).  0 for whole image.
                      <u>NOTE:</u> If YUV colorspace is used (see yuv suboption), special rules apply:
                         If the decoder uses slice rendering (see -noslices), this setting has  no  effect,  the
                         size of the slices as provided by the decoder is used.
                         If the decoder does not use slice rendering, the default is 16.
                 (no)osd
                      Enable or disable support for OSD rendering via OpenGL (default: enabled).  This option is
                      for testing; to disable the OSD use -osdlevel 0 instead.
                 (no)aspect
                      Enable  or  disable aspect scaling and pan-and-scan support (default: enabled).  Disabling
                      might increase speed.

       <b>gl_tiled</b>
              Variant of the OpenGL video output driver.  Supports videos larger than the maximum  texture  size
              but  lacks  many of the advanced features and optimizations of the gl driver and is unlikely to be
              extended further.
                 (no)glfinish
                      same as gl (default: enabled)
                 yuv=&lt;n&gt;
                      Select the type of YUV to RGB conversion.  If set to anything except 0 OSD  will  be  dis‐
                      abled and brightness, contrast and gamma setting is only available via the global X server
                      settings.  Apart from this the values have the same meaning as for -vo gl.

       <b>matrixview</b>
              OpenGL-based renderer creating a Matrix-like running-text effect.
                 cols=&lt;n&gt;
                      Number  of  text  columns  to  display.   Very low values (&lt; 16) will probably fail due to
                      scaler limitations.  Values not divisible by 16 may cause issues as well.
                 rows=&lt;n&gt;
                      Number of text rows to display.  Very low values (&lt; 16) will probably fail due  to  scaler
                      limitations.  Values not divisible by 16 may cause issues as well.

       <b>null</b>
              Produces no video output.  Useful for benchmarking.

       <b>aa</b>
              ASCII art video output driver that works on a text console.
              <u>NOTE:</u> The driver does not handle -aspect correctly.
              <u>HINT:</u>  You  probably have to specify -monitorpixelaspect.  Try 'mplayer -vo aa -monitorpixelaspect
              0.5'.

       <b>caca</b>
              Color ASCII art video output driver that works on a text console.

       <b>bl</b>
              Video playback using the Blinkenlights UDP protocol.  This driver is highly hardware specific.
                 &lt;subdevice&gt;
                      Explicitly choose the Blinkenlights subdevice driver to use.  It  is  something  like  ar‐
                      cade:host=localhost:2323 or hdl:file=name1,file=name2.  You must specify a subdevice.

       <b>ggi</b>
              GGI graphics system video output driver
                 &lt;driver&gt;
                      Explicitly  choose the GGI driver to use.  Replace any ',' that would appear in the driver
                      string by a '.'.

       <b>directfb</b>
              Play video using the DirectFB library.
                 (no)input
                      Use the DirectFB instead of the MPlayer keyboard code (default: enabled).
                 buffermode=single|double|triple
                      Double and triple buffering give best results if you want to avoid tearing issues.  Triple
                      buffering is more efficient than double buffering as it does not block MPlayer while wait‐
                      ing for the vertical retrace.  Single buffering should be avoided (default: single).
                 fieldparity=top|bottom
                      Control the output order for interlaced frames (default: disabled).  Valid values are  top
                      = top fields first, bottom = bottom fields first.  This option does not have any effect on
                      progressive  film  material  like most MPEG movies are.  You need to enable this option if
                      you have tearing issues or unsmooth motions watching interlaced film material.
                 layer=N
                      Will force layer with ID N for playback (default: -1 - auto).
                 dfbopts=&lt;list&gt;
                      Specify a parameter list for DirectFB.

       <b>dfbmga</b>
              Matrox G400/G450/G550 specific video output driver that uses the DirectFB library to make  use  of
              special  hardware  features.   Enables  CRTC2 (second head), displaying video independently of the
              first head.
                 (no)input
                      same as directfb (default: disabled)
                 buffermode=single|double|triple
                      same as directfb (default: triple)
                 fieldparity=top|bottom
                      same as directfb
                 (no)bes
                      Enable the use of the Matrox BES (backend scaler) (default: disabled).   Gives  very  good
                      results  concerning speed and output quality as interpolated picture processing is done in
                      hardware.  Works only on the primary head.
                 (no)spic
                      Make use of the Matrox sub picture layer to display the OSD (default: enabled).
                 (no)crtc2
                      Turn on TV-out on the second head (default: enabled).  The output quality is amazing as it
                      is a full interlaced picture with proper sync to every odd/even field.
                 tvnorm=pal|ntsc|auto
                      Will set the TV norm of the Matrox card without the  need  for  modifying  /etc/directfbrc
                      (default: disabled).  Valid norms are pal = PAL, ntsc = NTSC.  Special norm is auto (auto-
                      adjust using PAL/NTSC) because it decides which norm to use by looking at the framerate of
                      the movie.

              file (default: ./stream.yuv).  The format is the same as the one employed by mjpegtools,  so  this
              is  useful  if you want to process the video with the mjpegtools suite.  It supports the YV12 for‐
              mat.  If your source file has a different format and is interlaced, make sure to use -vf scale=::1
              to ensure the conversion uses interlaced mode.  You can combine it with the  -fixed-vo  option  to
              concatenate files with the same dimensions and fps value.

       <b>png</b>
              Output  each  frame  into  a  PNG file in the current directory.  Each file takes the frame number
              padded with leading zeros as name.  24bpp RGB and BGR formats are supported.
                 z=&lt;0-9&gt;
                      Specifies the compression level.  0 is no compression, 9 is maximum compression.

                 alpha
                      Create PNG files with an alpha channel.  Note that MPlayer in general does not support al‐
                      pha, so this will only be useful in some rare cases.

       <b>mng</b>
              Output video into an animated MNG file using 24 bpp RGB images with lossless compression.
                 output=&lt;filename&gt;
                      Specify the output filename (default: out.mng).

                 mplayer video.mkv -vo mng:output=test.mng

       <b>tga</b>
              Output each frame into a Targa file in the current directory.  Each file takes  the  frame  number
              padded  with  leading  zeros as name.  The purpose of this video output driver is to have a simple
              lossless image writer to use without any external library.  It supports the BGR[A]  color  format,
              with 15, 24 and 32 bpp.  You can force a particular format with the format video filter.

                 skiploopfilter=&lt;skipvalue&gt; (H.264 only)
                      Skips the loop filter (AKA deblocking) during H.264 decoding.  Since the filtered frame is
                      supposed to be used as reference for decoding dependent frames this has a worse effect  on
                      quality  than  not  doing  deblocking on e.g. MPEG-2 video.  But at least for high bitrate
                      HDTV this provides a big speedup with no visible quality loss.

                      &lt;skipvalue&gt; can be either one of the following:
                         none: Never skip.
                         default: Skip useless processing steps (e.g. 0 size packets in AVI).
                         nonref: Skip frames that are not referenced (i.e. not used for decoding  other  frames,
                         the error cannot "build up").
                         bidir: Skip B-Frames.
                         nonkey: Skip all frames except keyframes.
                         all: Skip all frames.

                 skipidct=&lt;skipvalue&gt; (MPEG-1/2 only)
                      Skips the IDCT step.  This degrades quality a lot of in almost all cases (see skiploopfil‐
                      ter for available skip values).

                 skipframe=&lt;skipvalue&gt;
                      Skips  decoding of frames completely.  Big speedup, but jerky motion and sometimes bad ar‐
                      tifacts (see skiploopfilter for available skip values).

                 threads=&lt;1-32&gt;

                      Wait  for a keyframe before displaying anything.  Avoids broken frames at startup or after
                      seeking with some formats.

       <b>-noslices</b>
              Disable drawing video by 16-pixel height slices/bands, instead draws the whole frame in  a  single
              run.   May  be  faster or slower, depending on video card and available cache.  It has effect only
              with libmpeg2 and libavcodec codecs.

       <b>-nosound</b>
              Do not play/encode sound.  Useful for benchmarking.

       <b>-novideo</b>
              Do not play/encode video.  In many cases this will not work, use -vc null -vo null instead.

       <b>-pp</b> <b>&lt;quality&gt;</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>-vf</b> <b>pp)</b>
              Set the DLL postprocess level.  This option is no longer usable with -vf pp.  It only  works  with
              Win32 DirectShow DLLs with internal postprocessing routines.  The valid range of -pp values varies
              by codec, it is mostly 0-6, where 0=disable, 6=slowest/best.

</pre><h4><b>AUDIO</b> <b>FILTERS</b></h4><pre>
       Audio filters allow you to modify the audio stream and its properties.  The syntax is:

       <b>-af</b> <b>&lt;filter1[=parameter1:parameter2:...],filter2,...&gt;</b>
              Setup a chain of audio filters.

       <u>NOTE:</u> To get a full list of available audio filters, see -af help.

       Audio filters are managed in lists.  There are a few commands to manage the filter list.

       <b>-af-add</b> <b>&lt;filter1[,filter2,...]&gt;</b>
              Appends the filters given as arguments to the filter list.

       <b>-af-pre</b> <b>&lt;filter1[,filter2,...]&gt;</b>
              Prepends the filters given as arguments to the filter list.

       <b>-af-del</b> <b>&lt;index1[,index2,...]&gt;</b>
              Deletes  the filters at the given indexes.  Index numbers start at 0, negative numbers address the
              end of the list (-1 is the last).

       <b>-af-clr</b>
              Completely empties the filter list.

       Available filters are:

       <b>resample[=srate[:sloppy[:type]]]</b>
              Changes the sample rate of the audio stream.  Can be used if you have a fixed frequency sound card
              or if you are stuck with an old sound card that is only capable of max 44.1kHz.   This  filter  is
              automatically  enabled  if  necessary.  It only supports 16-bit integer and float in native-endian
              format as input.
              <u>NOTE:</u> With MEncoder, you need to also use -srate &lt;srate&gt;.
                 &lt;srate&gt;
                      output sample frequency in Hz.  The valid range for this parameter is 8000 to 192000.   If
                      the  input  and  output  sample frequency are the same or if this parameter is omitted the
                      filter is automatically unloaded.  A high sample frequency  normally  improves  the  audio
                      quality, especially when used in combination with other filters.
                 &lt;sloppy&gt;
                      Allow (1) or disallow (0) the output frequency to differ slightly from the frequency given
                      by &lt;srate&gt; (default: 1).  Can be used if the startup of the playback is extremely slow.
                 &lt;type&gt;
                      Select which resampling method to use.
                         0: linear interpolation (fast, poor quality especially when upsampling)
                         1: polyphase filterbank and integer processing
                         2: polyphase filterbank and floating point processing (slow, best quality)

              <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                 mplayer -af resample=44100:0:0
                      would  set  the output frequency of the resample filter to 44100Hz using exact output fre‐
                      quency scaling and linear interpolation.

       <b>lavcresample[=srate[:length[:linear[:count[:cutoff]]]]]</b>
              Changes the sample rate of the audio stream to an integer &lt;srate&gt; in Hz.   It  only  supports  the
              16-bit native-endian format.
              <u>NOTE:</u> With MEncoder, you need to also use -srate &lt;srate&gt;.
                 &lt;srate&gt;
                      the output sample rate
                 &lt;length&gt;
                      length of the filter with respect to the lower sampling rate (default: 16)
                 &lt;linear&gt;
                      if 1 then filters will be linearly interpolated between polyphase entries
                 &lt;count&gt;
                      log2  of  the  number  of polyphase entries (..., 10-&gt;1024, 11-&gt;2048, 12-&gt;4096, ...)  (de‐
                      fault: 10-&gt;1024)
                 &lt;cutoff&gt;
                      cutoff frequency (0.0-1.0), default set depending upon filter length

       <b>lavcac3enc[=tospdif[:bitrate[:minchn]]]</b>
              Encode multi-channel audio to AC-3 at runtime using libavcodec.  Supports 16-bit native-endian in‐
              put format, maximum 6 channels.  The output is big-endian when outputting a raw AC-3  stream,  na‐
              tive-endian when outputting to S/PDIF.  The output sample rate of this filter is same with the in‐
              put sample rate.  When input sample rate is 48kHz, 44.1kHz, or 32kHz, this filter directly use it.
              Otherwise  a  resampling  filter  is auto-inserted before this filter to make the input and output
              sample rate be 48kHz.  You need to specify '-channels N' to make the decoder decode audio into  N-
              channel, then the filter can encode the N-channel input to AC-3.
                 &lt;tospdif&gt;
                      Output raw AC-3 stream if zero or not set, output to S/PDIF for passthrough when &lt;tospdif&gt;
                      is set non-zero.
                 &lt;bitrate&gt;
                      The  bitrate  to  encode the AC-3 stream.  Set it to either 384 or 384000 to get 384kbits.
                      Valid values: 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 160, 192, 224, 256,
                                    320, 384, 448, 512, 576, 640 Default bitrate is based on the  input  channel
                      number: 1ch: 96,  2ch: 192,  3ch: 224,  4ch: 384,  5ch: 448,  6ch: 448
                 &lt;minchn&gt;
                      If the input channel number is less than &lt;minchn&gt;, the filter will detach itself (default:
                      5).

       <b>sweep[=speed]</b>
              Produces a sine sweep.
                 &lt;0.0-1.0&gt;
                      Sine function delta, use very low values to hear the sweep.

       <b>sinesuppress[=freq:decay]</b>
              Remove  a  sine at the specified frequency.  Useful to get rid of the 50/60Hz noise on low quality
              audio equipment.  It probably only works on mono input.
                 &lt;freq&gt;
                      The frequency of the sine which should be removed (in Hz) (default: 50)
                 &lt;decay&gt;
                      Controls the adaptivity (a larger value will make the filter adapt to amplitude and  phase
                      changes quicker, a smaller value will make the adaptation slower) (default: 0.0001).  Rea‐
                      sonable values are around 0.001.

       <b>bs2b[=option1:option2:...]</b>
              Bauer stereophonic to binaural transformation using libbs2b.  Improves the headphone listening ex‐
              perience  by  making  the  sound similar to that from loudspeakers, allowing each ear to hear both
              channels and taking into account the distance difference and the head shadowing effect.  It is ap‐
              plicable only to 2 channel audio.

       <b>equalizer=[g1:g2:g3:...:g10]</b>
              10 octave band graphic equalizer, implemented using 10 IIR band pass filters.  This means that  it
              works  regardless  of  what type of audio is being played back.  The center frequencies for the 10
              bands are:

              No. frequency
              0    31.25 Hz
              1    62.50 Hz
              2   125.00 Hz
              3   250.00 Hz
              4   500.00 Hz
              5    1.00 kHz
              6    2.00 kHz
              7    4.00 kHz
              8    8.00 kHz
              9   16.00 kHz

              If the sample rate of the sound being played is lower than the center frequency  for  a  frequency
              band,  then  that band will be disabled.  A known bug with this filter is that the characteristics
              for the uppermost band are not completely symmetric if the sample rate is close to the center fre‐
              quency of that band.  This problem can be worked around by upsampling the sound using the resample
              filter before it reaches this filter.

                 mplayer -af equalizer=11:11:10:5:0:-12:0:5:12:12 media.avi
                      Would amplify the sound in the upper and lower frequency region while canceling it  almost
                      completely around 1kHz.

       <b>channels=nch[:nr:from1:to1:from2:to2:from3:to3:...]</b>
              Can  be used for adding, removing, routing and copying audio channels.  If only &lt;nch&gt; is given the
              default routing is used, it works as follows: If the number of output channels is bigger than  the
              number  of input channels empty channels are inserted (except mixing from mono to stereo, then the
              mono channel is repeated in both of the output channels).  If the number  of  output  channels  is
              smaller than the number of input channels the exceeding channels are truncated.
                 &lt;nch&gt;
                      number of output channels (1-8)
                 &lt;nr&gt;
                      number of routes (1-8)
                 &lt;from1:to1:from2:to2:from3:to3:...&gt;
                      Pairs of numbers between 0 and 7 that define where to route each channel.

              <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                 mplayer -af channels=4:4:0:1:1:0:2:2:3:3 media.avi
                      Would change the number of channels to 4 and set up 4 routes that swap channel 0 and chan‐
                      nel 1 and leave channel 2 and 3 intact.  Observe that if media containing two channels was
                      played back, channels 2 and 3 would contain silence but 0 and 1 would still be swapped.
                 mplayer -af channels=6:4:0:0:0:1:0:2:0:3 media.avi
                      Would  change the number of channels to 6 and set up 4 routes that copy channel 0 to chan‐
                      nels 0 to 3.  Channel 4 and 5 will contain silence.

       <b>format[=format]</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>-format)</b>
              Convert between different sample formats.  Automatically enabled when needed by the sound card  or
              another filter.
                 &lt;format&gt;
                      Sets  the  desired  format.  The general form is 'sbe', where 's' denotes the sign (either
                      's' for signed or 'u' for unsigned), 'b' denotes the number of bits per sample (16, 24  or
                      32) and 'e' denotes the endianness ('le' means little-endian, 'be' big-endian and 'ne' the
                      endianness  of  the  computer  MPlayer is running on).  Valid values (amongst others) are:
                      's16le', 'u32be' and 'u24ne'.  Exceptions to this rule that are also valid  format  speci‐
                      fiers: u8, s8, floatle, floatbe, floatne, mulaw, alaw, mpeg2, ac3 and imaadpcm.

       <b>volume[=v[:sc]]</b>
              Implements  software  volume control.  Use this filter with caution since it can reduce the signal
              to noise ratio of the sound.  In most cases it is best to set the level for the PCM sound to  max,
              leave this filter out and control the output level to your speakers with the master volume control
              of  the  mixer.  In case your sound card has a digital PCM mixer instead of an analog one, and you
              hear distortion, use the MASTER mixer instead.  If there is an external amplifier connected to the
              computer (this is almost always the case), the noise level can be minimized by adjusting the  mas‐
              ter level and the volume knob on the amplifier until the hissing noise in the background is gone.
              This  filter has a second feature: It measures the overall maximum sound level and prints out that
              level when MPlayer exits.  This volume estimate can be used for setting the sound  level  in  MEn‐
              coder  such  that  the  maximum dynamic range is utilized.  This feature currently only works with
              floating-point data, use e.g. -af-adv force=5, or use -af stats.
              <u>NOTE:</u> This filter is not reentrant and can therefore only be enabled once for every audio stream.
                 &lt;v&gt;
                      Sets the desired gain in dB for all channels in the stream from  -200dB  to  +60dB,  where
                      -200dB mutes the sound completely and +60dB equals a gain of 1000 (default: 0).
                 &lt;sc&gt;
                      Turns  soft  clipping  on (1) or off (0).  Soft-clipping can make the sound more smooth if
                      very high volume levels are used.  Enable this option if the dynamic range  of  the  loud‐
                      speakers is very low.
                      <u>WARNING:</u> This feature creates distortion and should be considered a last resort.

              <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                 mplayer -af volume=10.1:0 media.avi
                      Would amplify the sound by 10.1dB and hard-clip if the sound level is too high.

       <b>pan=n[:L00:L01:L02:...L10:L11:L12:...Ln0:Ln1:Ln2:...]</b>
              Mixes  channels  arbitrarily.   Basically a combination of the volume and the channels filter that
              can be used to down-mix many channels to only a few, e.g. stereo to mono or vary  the  "width"  of
              the  center speaker in a surround sound system.  This filter is hard to use, and will require some
              tinkering before the desired result is obtained.  The number of options for this filter depends on
              the number of output channels.  An example how to downmix a six-channel file to two channels  with
              this filter can be found in the examples section near the end.
                 &lt;n&gt;
                      number of output channels (1-8)
                 &lt;Lij&gt;
                      How  much  of  input  channel i is mixed into output channel j (0-1).  So in principle you
                      first have n numbers saying what to do with the first input channel, then n  numbers  that
                      act  on  the  second  input channel etc.  If you do not specify any numbers for some input
                      channels, 0 is assumed.

              <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                 mplayer -af pan=1:0.5:0.5 media.avi
                      Would down-mix from stereo to mono.
                 mplayer -af pan=3:1:0:0.5:0:1:0.5 media.avi
                      Would give 3 channel output leaving channels 0 and 1 intact, and mix channels 0 and 1 into
                      output channel 2 (which could be sent to a subwoofer for example).

       <b>sub[=fc:ch]</b>
              Adds a subwoofer channel to the audio stream.  The audio data  used  for  creating  the  subwoofer
              channel  is  an average of the sound in channel 0 and channel 1.  The resulting sound is then low-
              pass filtered by a 4th order Butterworth filter with a default cutoff frequency of 60Hz and  added
              to a separate channel in the audio stream.
              <u>Warning:</u>  Disable  this  filter  when you are playing DVDs with Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, otherwise
              this filter will disrupt the sound to the subwoofer.
                 &lt;fc&gt;
                      cutoff frequency in Hz for the low-pass filter (20Hz to 300Hz)  (default:  60Hz)  For  the
                      best  result  try  setting the cutoff frequency as low as possible.  This will improve the
                      stereo or surround sound experience.
                 &lt;ch&gt;
                      Determines the channel number in which to insert the sub-channel  audio.   Channel  number
                      can  be  between 0 and 7 (default: 5).  Observe that the number of channels will automati‐
                      cally be increased to &lt;ch&gt; if necessary.

              <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                 mplayer -af sub=100:4 -channels 5 media.avi
                      Would add a sub-woofer channel with a cutoff frequency of 100Hz to output channel 4.

       <b>center</b>
              Creates a center channel from the front channels.  May currently be low quality as it does not im‐
              plement a high-pass filter for proper extraction yet, but averages and  halves  the  channels  in‐
              stead.
                 &lt;ch&gt;
                      Determines  the  channel number in which to insert the center channel.  Channel number can
                      be between 0 and 7 (default: 5).  Observe that the number of channels  will  automatically
                      be increased to &lt;ch&gt; if necessary.

       <b>surround[=delay]</b>
              Decoder  for  matrix  encoded surround sound like Dolby Surround.  Many files with 2 channel audio
              actually contain matrixed surround sound.  Requires a sound card supporting at least 4 channels.
                 &lt;delay&gt;
                      delay time in ms for the rear speakers (0 to 1000) (default: 20) This delay should be  set
                      as follows: If d1 is the distance from the listening position to the front speakers and d2
                      is the distance from the listening position to the rear speakers, then the delay should be
                      set to 15ms if d1 &lt;= d2 and to 15 + 5*(d1-d2) if d1 &gt; d2.

              <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                 mplayer -af surround=15 -channels 4 media.avi
                      Would add surround sound decoding with 15ms delay for the sound to the rear speakers.

       <b>delay[=ch1:ch2:...]</b>
              Delays  the  sound  to the loudspeakers such that the sound from the different channels arrives at
              the listening position simultaneously.  It is only useful if you have more than 2 loudspeakers.
                 ch1,ch2,...
                      The delay in ms that should be imposed on each channel (floating point  number  between  0
                      and 1000).

              To calculate the required delay for the different channels do as follows:

              1. Measure the distance to the loudspeakers in meters in relation to your listening position, giv‐
                 ing  you  the distances s1 to s5 (for a 5.1 system).  There is no point in compensating for the
                 subwoofer (you will not hear the difference anyway).

              2. Subtract the distances s1 to s5 from the maximum distance, i.e. s[i]  =  max(s)  -  s[i];  i  =
                 1...5.

              3. Calculate the required delays in ms as d[i] = 1000*s[i]/342; i = 1...5.

              <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                 mplayer -af delay=10.5:10.5:0:0:7:0 media.avi
                      Would  delay  front left and right by 10.5ms, the two rear channels and the sub by 0ms and
                      the center channel by 7ms.

       <b>export[=mmapped_file[:nsamples]]</b>
              Exports the incoming signal to other processes using memory mapping (mmap()).  Memory mapped areas
              contain a header:

              int nch                      /*number of channels*/
              int size                     /*buffer size*/

                      file to map data to (default: <a href="file:~/.mplayer/mplayer-af_export">~/.mplayer/mplayer-af_export</a>)
                 &lt;nsamples&gt;
                      number of samples per channel (default: 512)

              <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                 mplayer -af export=/tmp/mplayer-af_export:1024 media.avi
                      Would export 1024 samples per channel to '/tmp/mplayer-af_export'.

       <b>extrastereo[=mul]</b>
              (Linearly) increases the difference between left and right channels which adds some sort of "live"
              effect to playback.
                 &lt;mul&gt;
                      Sets the difference coefficient (default: 2.5).  0.0 means mono  sound  (average  of  both
                      channels),  with  1.0  sound  will be unchanged, with -1.0 left and right channels will be
                      swapped.

       <b>volnorm[=method:target]</b>
              Maximizes the volume without distorting the sound.
                 &lt;method&gt;
                      Sets the used method.
                         1: Use a single sample to smooth the variations via the  standard  weighted  mean  over
                         past samples (default).
                         2:  Use  several  samples  to smooth the variations via the standard weighted mean over
                         past samples.

                 &lt;target&gt;
                      Sets the target amplitude as a fraction of the  maximum  for  the  sample  type  (default:

       <b>ladspa=file:label[:controls...]</b>
              Load  a  LADSPA  (Linux Audio Developer's Simple Plugin API) plugin.  This filter is reentrant, so
              multiple LADSPA plugins can be used at once.
                 &lt;file&gt;
                      Specifies the LADSPA plugin library file.  If LADSPA_PATH is  set,  it  searches  for  the
                      specified file.  If it is not set, you must supply a fully specified pathname.
                 &lt;label&gt;
                      Specifies the filter within the library.  Some libraries contain only one filter, but oth‐
                      ers  contain  many  of them.  Entering 'help' here, will list all available filters within
                      the specified library, which eliminates the use of 'listplugins' from the LADSPA SDK.
                 &lt;controls&gt;
                      Controls are zero or more floating point values that determine the behavior of the  loaded
                      plugin  (for  example  delay,  threshold or gain).  In verbose mode (add -v to the MPlayer
                      command line), all available controls and their valid ranges are printed.  This eliminates
                      the use of 'analyseplugin' from the LADSPA SDK.

       <b>comp</b>
              Compressor/expander filter usable for microphone input.  Prevents artifacts on very loud sound and
              raises the volume on very low sound.  This filter is untested, maybe even unusable.

       <b>gate</b>
              Noise gate filter similar to the comp audio filter.  This filter is untested, maybe even unusable.

       <b>karaoke</b>
              Simple voice removal filter exploiting the fact that voice is usually recorded with mono gear  and
              later  'center'  mixed onto the final audio stream.  Beware that this filter will turn your signal
              into mono.  Works well for 2 channel tracks; do not bother trying it on  anything  but  2  channel
              stereo.

       <b>scaletempo[=option1:option2:...]</b>
              Scales audio tempo without altering pitch, optionally synced to playback speed (default).
              This works by playing ´stride´ ms of audio at normal speed then consuming ´stride*scale´ ms of in‐
              put  audio.   It pieces the strides together by blending ´overlap´% of stride with audio following
              the previous stride.  It optionally performs a short statistical analysis on the next ´search´  ms
              of audio to determine the best overlap position.
                 scale=&lt;amount&gt;
                      Nominal amount to scale tempo.  Scales this amount in addition to speed.  (default: 1.0)
                 stride=&lt;amount&gt;
                      Length  in  milliseconds  to  output each stride.  Too high of value will cause noticeable
                      skips at high scale amounts and an echo at low scale amounts.  Very low values will  alter
                      pitch.  Increasing improves performance.  (default: 60)
                 overlap=&lt;percent&gt;
                      Percentage of stride to overlap.  Decreasing improves performance.  (default: .20)
                 search=&lt;amount&gt;
                      Length  in  milliseconds to search for best overlap position.  Decreasing improves perfor‐
                      mance greatly.  On slow systems, you will probably want to set this very  low.   (default:

                      playback speed, would change pitch, leaving audio tempo at 1.2x.

       <b>stats</b>
              Collects and prints statistics about the audio stream, especially the  volume.   These  statistics
              are  especially  intended  to  help adjusting the volume while avoiding clipping.  The volumes are
              printed in dB and compatible with the volume audio filter, they are always rounded towards -0dB.

              The 'n_samples' field is the total number of samples seen by the filter.  The 'mean_volume'  field
              is  the  root  mean  square.  The 'max_volume' field is exactly what it says.  The 'histogram_Xdb'
              fields count how many samples were at -XdB, for X just below max_volume.

              For example, if max_volume is -7dB and histogram_7dB is 19, 'volume=7' will not cause clipping and
              'volume=8' will cause clipping on exactly 19 samples.

</pre><h4><b>VIDEO</b> <b>FILTERS</b></h4><pre>
       Video filters allow you to modify the video stream and its properties.  The syntax is:

       <b>-vf</b> <b>&lt;filter1[=parameter1:parameter2:...],filter2,...&gt;</b>
              Setup a chain of video filters.

       Many parameters are optional and set to default values if omitted.  To explicitly use a default value set
       a parameter to '-1'.  Parameters w:h means width x height in pixels, x:y means x;y position counted  from
       the upper left corner of the bigger image.
       <u>NOTE:</u> To get a full list of available video filters, see -vf help.

       Video filters are managed in lists.  There are a few commands to manage the filter list.

       <b>-vf-add</b> <b>&lt;filter1[,filter2,...]&gt;</b>
              Appends the filters given as arguments to the filter list.

       <b>-vf-pre</b> <b>&lt;filter1[,filter2,...]&gt;</b>
              Prepends the filters given as arguments to the filter list.

       <b>-vf-del</b> <b>&lt;index1[,index2,...]&gt;</b>
              Deletes  the filters at the given indexes.  Index numbers start at 0, negative numbers address the
              end of the list (-1 is the last).

       <b>-vf-clr</b>
              Completely empties the filter list.

       With filters that support it, you can access parameters by their name.

       <b>-vf</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;=help</b>
              Prints the parameter names and parameter value ranges for a particular filter.

       <b>-vf</b> <b>&lt;filter=named_parameter1=value1[:named_parameter2=value2:...]&gt;</b>
              Sets a named parameter to the given value.  Use on and off or yes and no to set flag parameters.

       Available filters are:

       <b>crop[=w:h:x:y]</b>
              Crops the given part of the image and discards the  rest.   Useful  to  remove  black  bands  from
              widescreen movies.
                 &lt;w&gt;,&lt;h&gt;
                      Cropped width and height, defaults to original width and height.
                 &lt;x&gt;,&lt;y&gt;
                      Position of the cropped picture, defaults to center.

       <b>cropdetect[=limit:round[:reset]]</b>
              Calculates necessary cropping parameters and prints the recommended parameters to stdout.
                 &lt;limit&gt;
                      Threshold,  which  can  be  optionally specified from nothing (0) to everything (255) (de‐
                      fault: 24).
                 &lt;round&gt;
                      Value which the width/height should be divisible by (default: 16).  The offset is automat‐
                      ically adjusted to center the video.  Use 2 to get only even dimensions (needed for  4:2:2
                      video).  16 is best when encoding to most video codecs.
                 &lt;reset&gt;
                      Counter that determines after how many frames cropdetect will reset the previously detect‐
                      ed largest video area and start over to detect the current optimal crop area (default: 0).
                      This can be useful when channel logos distort the video area.  0 indicates never reset and
                      return the largest area encountered during playback.

       <b>rectangle[=w:h:x:y]</b>
              Draws  a  rectangle  of the requested width and height at the specified coordinates over the image
              and prints current rectangle parameters to the console.  This can be used to find optimal cropping
              parameters.  If you bind the input.conf directive 'change_rectangle' to keystrokes, you  can  move
              and resize the rectangle on the fly.
                 &lt;w&gt;,&lt;h&gt;
                      width and height (default: -1, maximum possible width where boundaries are still visible.)
                 &lt;x&gt;,&lt;y&gt;
                      top left corner position (default: -1, uppermost leftmost)

       <b>expand[=w:h:x:y:o:a:r]</b>
              Expands (not scales) movie resolution to the given value and places the unscaled original at coor‐
              dinates x, y.  Can be used for placing subtitles/OSD in the resulting black bands.

                 &lt;w&gt;,&lt;h&gt;
                      Expanded  width,height  (default: original width,height).  Negative values for w and h are
                      treated as offsets to the original size.

                      <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                           expand=0:-50:0:0
                                  Adds a 50 pixel border to the bottom of the picture.

                 &lt;x&gt;,&lt;y&gt;
                      position of original image on the expanded image (default: center)

                 &lt;o&gt;
                      OSD/subtitle rendering
                         0: disable (default)
                         1: enable

                 &lt;a&gt;
                      Expands to fit an aspect instead of a resolution (default: 0).

                      <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                           expand=800:::::4/3
                                  Expands to 800x600, unless the source is higher resolution, in which  case  it
                                  expands to fill a 4/3 aspect.

                 &lt;r&gt;
                      Rounds up to make both width and height divisible by &lt;r&gt; (default: 1).

       <b>flip</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>-flip)</b>
              Flips the image upside down.

       <b>mirror</b>
              Mirrors the image on the Y axis.

       <b>rotate[=&lt;0-7&gt;]</b>
              Rotates  the image by 90 degrees and optionally flips it.  For values between 4-7 rotation is only
              done if the movie geometry is portrait and not landscape.

                 0    Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise and flip (default).

                 1    Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise.

                 2    Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise.

                 3    Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise and flip.

       <b>scale[=w:h[:interlaced[:chr_drop[:par[:par2[:presize[:noup[:arnd]]]]]]]]</b>
              Scales the image with the software scaler (slow) and performs a  YUV&lt;-&gt;RGB  colorspace  conversion
              (also see -sws).

                 &lt;w&gt;,&lt;h&gt;
                      scaled width/height (default: original width/height)
                      <u>NOTE:</u> If -zoom is used, and underlying filters (including libvo) are incapable of scaling,
                      it defaults to d_width/d_height!
                          0:   scaled d_width/d_height
                         -1:   original width/height
                         -2:   Calculate w/h using the other dimension and the prescaled aspect ratio.
                         -3:   Calculate w/h using the other dimension and the original aspect ratio.
                         -(n+8): Like -n above, but rounding the dimension to the closest multiple of 16.

                 &lt;interlaced&gt;
                      Toggle interlaced scaling.
                         0: off (default)
                         1: on

                 &lt;chr_drop&gt;
                      chroma skipping
                         0: Use all available input lines for chroma.
                         1: Use only every 2. input line for chroma.
                         2: Use only every 4. input line for chroma.
                         3: Use only every 8. input line for chroma.

                 &lt;par&gt;[:&lt;par2&gt;] (also see -sws)
                      Set some scaling parameters depending on the type of scaler selected with -sws.
                         -sws 2 (bicubic):  B (blurring) and C (ringing)

                         0: Disable accurate rounding (default).
                         1: Enable accurate rounding.

       <b>dsize[=aspect|w:h:aspect-method:r]</b>
              Changes the intended display size/aspect at an arbitrary point in the filter chain.  Aspect can be
              given as a fraction (4/3) or floating point number (1.33).  Alternatively, you may specify the ex‐
              act display width and height desired.  Note that this filter does <b>not</b> do any  scaling  itself;  it
              just  affects  what  later scalers (software or hardware) will do when auto-scaling to correct as‐
              pect.

                 &lt;w&gt;,&lt;h&gt;
                      New display width and height.  Can also be these special values:
                          0:   original display width and height
                         -1:   original video width and height (default)
                         -2:   Calculate w/h using the other dimension and the original display aspect ratio.
                         -3:   Calculate w/h using the other dimension and the original video aspect ratio.

                 <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                           dsize=800:-2
                                  Specifies a display resolution of 800x600 for a 4/3 aspect video,  or  800x450
                                  for a 16/9 aspect video.
                 &lt;aspect-method&gt;
                      Modifies width and height according to original aspect ratios.
                         -1: Ignore original aspect ratio (default).
                          0: Keep display aspect ratio by using &lt;w&gt; and &lt;h&gt; as maximum resolution.
                          1: Keep display aspect ratio by using &lt;w&gt; and &lt;h&gt; as minimum resolution.
                          2: Keep video aspect ratio by using &lt;w&gt; and &lt;h&gt; as maximum resolution.
                          3: Keep video aspect ratio by using &lt;w&gt; and &lt;h&gt; as minimum resolution.

                 <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                           dsize=800:600:0
                                  Specifies  a  display  resolution  of at most 800x600, or smaller, in order to
                                  keep aspect.

                 &lt;r&gt;
                      Rounds up to make both width and height divisible by &lt;r&gt; (default: 1).

       <b>yvu9</b>
              Forces software YVU9 to YV12 colorspace conversion.  Deprecated in favor of the software scaler.

       <b>yuvcsp</b>
              Clamps YUV color values to the CCIR 601 range without doing real conversion.

       <b>palette</b>

              Enables the specified chain of postprocessing subfilters.  Subfilters must be separated by '/' and
              can be disabled by prepending a '-'.  Each subfilter and some options have a short and a long name
              that can be used interchangeably, i.e. dr/dering are the same.  All subfilters  share  common  op‐
              tions to determine their scope:
                 a/autoq
                      Automatically switch the subfilter off if the CPU is too slow.
                 c/chrom
                      Do chrominance filtering, too (default).
                 y/nochrom
                      Do luminance filtering only (no chrominance).
                 n/noluma
                      Do chrominance filtering only (no luminance).

              <u>NOTE:</u> -pphelp shows a list of available subfilters.

              Available subfilters are

                 hb/hdeblock[:difference[:flatness]]
                      horizontal deblocking filter
                         &lt;difference&gt;: Difference factor where higher values mean more deblocking (default: 32).
                         &lt;flatness&gt;: Flatness threshold where lower values mean more deblocking (default: 39).

                 vb/vdeblock[:difference[:flatness]]
                      vertical deblocking filter
                         &lt;difference&gt;: Difference factor where higher values mean more deblocking (default: 32).
                         &lt;flatness&gt;: Flatness threshold where lower values mean more deblocking (default: 39).

                 ha/hadeblock[:difference[:flatness]]
                      accurate horizontal deblocking filter
                         &lt;difference&gt;: Difference factor where higher values mean more deblocking (default: 32).
                         &lt;flatness&gt;: Flatness threshold where lower values mean more deblocking (default: 39).

                 va/vadeblock[:difference[:flatness]]
                      accurate vertical deblocking filter
                         &lt;difference&gt;: Difference factor where higher values mean more deblocking (default: 32).
                         &lt;flatness&gt;: Flatness threshold where lower values mean more deblocking (default: 39).

       <b>eq2[=gamma:contrast:brightness:saturation:rg:gg:bg:weight]</b>
              Alternative software equalizer that uses lookup tables (very slow), allowing gamma  correction  in
              addition  to  simple brightness and contrast adjustment.  Note that it uses the same MMX optimized

                 &lt;0.1-10&gt;
                      initial gamma value (default: 1.0)

                 &lt;0-1&gt;
                      The weight parameter can be used to reduce the effect of a high gamma value on bright  im‐
                      age areas, e.g. keep them from getting overamplified and just plain white.  A value of 0.0
                      turns  the gamma correction all the way down while 1.0 leaves it at its full strength (de‐
                      fault: 1.0).

       <b>hue[=hue:saturation]</b>
              Software equalizer with interactive controls just like the hardware equalizer,  for  cards/drivers

                      initial saturation, where negative values result in a negative chroma (default: 1.0)

       <b>halfpack[=f]</b>
              Convert  planar  YUV  4:2:0  to half-height packed 4:2:2, downsampling luma but keeping all chroma
              samples.  Useful for output to low-resolution display devices when hardware  downscaling  is  poor
              quality or is not available.  Can also be used as a primitive luma-only deinterlacer with very low
              CPU usage.
                 &lt;f&gt;
                      By  default, halfpack averages pairs of lines when downsampling.  Any value different from
                      0 or 1 gives the default (averaging) behavior.
                         0: Only use even lines when downsampling.
                         1: Only use odd lines when downsampling.

       <b>ilpack[=mode]</b>
              When interlaced video is stored in YUV 4:2:0 formats, chroma interlacing does not line up properly
              due to vertical downsampling of the chroma channels.  This filter packs the planar 4:2:0 data into
              YUY2 (4:2:2) format with the chroma lines in their proper locations, so that in  any  given  scan‐
              line, the luma and chroma data both come from the same field.
                 &lt;mode&gt;
                      Select the sampling mode.
                         0: nearest-neighbor sampling, fast but incorrect
                         1: linear interpolation (default)

       <b>harddup</b>
              Only useful with MEncoder.  If harddup is used when encoding, it will force duplicate frames to be
              encoded  in  the output.  This uses slightly more space, but is necessary for output to MPEG files
              or if you plan to demux and remux the video stream after encoding.  Should be placed  at  or  near
              the end of the filter chain unless you have a good reason to do otherwise.

       <b>softskip</b>
              Only useful with MEncoder.  Softskip moves the frame skipping (dropping) step of encoding from be‐
              fore  the  filter  chain to some point during the filter chain.  This allows filters which need to
              see all frames (inverse telecine, temporal denoising,  etc.)  to  function  properly.   Should  be
              placed  after  the filters which need to see all frames and before any subsequent filters that are
              CPU-intensive.

       <b>decimate[=max:hi:lo:frac]</b>
              Drops frames that do not differ greatly from the previous frame in order to reduce framerate.  The
              main use of this filter is for very-low-bitrate encoding (e.g. streaming over dialup  modem),  but
              it could in theory be used for fixing movies that were inverse-telecined incorrectly.
                 &lt;max&gt;
                      Sets  the  maximum number of consecutive frames which can be dropped (if positive), or the
                      minimum interval between dropped frames (if negative).
                 &lt;hi&gt;,&lt;lo&gt;,&lt;frac&gt;
                      A frame is a candidate for dropping if no 8x8 region differs by more than a  threshold  of
                      &lt;hi&gt;, and if not more than &lt;frac&gt; portion (1 meaning the whole image) differs by more than
                      a threshold of &lt;lo&gt;.  Values of &lt;hi&gt; and &lt;lo&gt; are for 8x8 pixel blocks and represent actu‐
                      al  pixel  value differences, so a threshold of 64 corresponds to 1 unit of difference for
                      each pixel, or the same spread out differently over the block.

              (De)interleaves lines.  The goal of this filter is to add the ability to process interlaced images
              pre-field without deinterlacing them.  You can filter your interlaced DVD and  play  it  on  a  TV
              without  breaking  the  interlacing.  While deinterlacing (with the postprocessing filter) removes
              interlacing permanently (by smoothing, averaging, etc) deinterleaving  splits  the  frame  into  2
              fields  (so  called half pictures), so you can process (filter) them independently and then re-in‐
              terleave them.

       <b>fil[=i|d]</b>
              (De)interleaves lines.  This filter is very similar to the il filter but  much  faster,  the  main
              disadvantage  is  that  it does not always work.  Especially if combined with other filters it may
              produce randomly messed up images, so be happy if it works but do not complain if it does not  for
              your combination of filters.

       <b>field[=n]</b>
              Extracts  a  single  field  from  an interlaced image using stride arithmetic to avoid wasting CPU
              time.  The optional argument n specifies whether to extract the even or the odd  field  (depending
              on whether n is even or odd).

       <b>detc[=var1=value1:var2=value2:...]</b>
              Attempts to reverse the 'telecine' process to recover a clean, non-interlaced stream at film fram‐
              erate.   This was the first and most primitive inverse telecine filter to be added to MPlayer/MEn‐
              coder.  It works by latching onto the telecine 3:2 pattern and following it as long  as  possible.
              This  makes it suitable for perfectly-telecined material, even in the presence of a fair degree of
              noise, but it will fail in the presence of complex post-telecine edits.  Development on this  fil‐
              ter  is  no  longer  taking place, as ivtc, pullup, and filmdint are better for most applications.
              The following arguments (see syntax above) may be used to control detc's behavior:

                 &lt;dr&gt;
                      Set the frame dropping mode.
                         0: Do not drop frames to maintain fixed output framerate (default).
                         1: Always drop a frame when there have been no drops or telecine merges in the  past  5
                         frames.
                         2: Always maintain exact 5:4 input to output frame ratio.
                         <u>NOTE:</u> Use mode 1 or 2 with MEncoder.

                 &lt;am&gt;
                      Analysis mode.
                         0: Fixed pattern with initial frame number specified by &lt;fr&gt;.
                         1: aggressive search for telecine pattern (default)

                 &lt;fr&gt;
                      Set initial frame number in sequence.  0-2 are the three clean progressive frames; 3 and 4
                      are  the  two  interlaced frames.  The default, -1, means 'not in telecine sequence'.  The
                      number specified here is the type for  the  imaginary  previous  frame  before  the  movie
                      starts.

                 &lt;t0&gt;, &lt;t1&gt;, &lt;t2&gt;, &lt;t3&gt;
                      Threshold values to be used in certain modes.

       <b>ivtc[=1]</b>
              Experimental 'stateless' inverse telecine filter.  Rather than trying to lock on to a pattern like
              the  detc filter does, ivtc makes its decisions independently for each frame.  This will give much
              better results for material that has undergone heavy editing after telecine was applied, but as  a
              result  it  is  not  as  forgiving of noisy input, for example TV capture.  The optional parameter
              (ivtc=1) corresponds to the dr=1 option for the detc filter, and should be used with MEncoder  but
              not  with MPlayer.  As with detc, you must specify the correct output framerate (-ofps 24000/1001)
              when using MEncoder.  Further development on ivtc has stopped, as the pullup and filmdint  filters
              appear to be much more accurate.

       <b>pullup[=jl:jr:jt:jb:sb:mp]</b>
              Third-generation  pulldown  reversal  (inverse  telecine)  filter, capable of handling mixed hard-
              telecine, 24000/1001 fps progressive, and 30000/1001 fps progressive content.  The  pullup  filter
              is  designed  to  be  much more robust than detc or ivtc, by taking advantage of future context in
              making its decisions.  Like ivtc, pullup is stateless in the sense that it does not  lock  onto  a
              pattern  to  follow,  but  it  instead  looks forward to the following fields in order to identify
              matches and rebuild progressive frames.  It is still under development, but believed to  be  quite
              accurate.

                 jl, jr, jt, and jb
                      These  options  set  the amount of "junk" to ignore at the left, right, top, and bottom of
                      the image, respectively.  Left/right are in units of 8 pixels,  while  top/bottom  are  in
                      units of 2 lines.  The default is 8 pixels on each side.

                 sb (strict breaks)
                      Setting  this  option to 1 will reduce the chances of pullup generating an occasional mis‐
                      matched frame, but it may also cause an excessive number of frames to  be  dropped  during
                      high  motion  sequences.   Conversely, setting it to -1 will make pullup match fields more
                      easily.  This may help processing of video where there  is  slight  blurring  between  the
                      fields, but may also cause there to be interlaced frames in the output.

                 mp (metric plane)
                      This option may be set to 1 or 2 to use a chroma plane instead of the luma plane for doing
                      pullup's  computations.  This may improve accuracy on very clean source material, but more
                      likely will decrease accuracy, especially if there is chroma noise (rainbow effect) or any
                      grayscale video.  The main purpose of setting mp to a chroma plane is to reduce  CPU  load
                      and make pullup usable in realtime on slow machines.

              <u>NOTE:</u> Always follow pullup with the softskip filter when encoding to ensure that pullup is able to
              see each frame.  Failure to do so will lead to incorrect output and will usually crash, due to de‐
              sign limitations in the codec/filter layer.

       <b>filmdint[=options]</b>
              Inverse  telecine  filter, similar to the pullup filter above.  It is designed to handle any pull‐
              down pattern, including mixed soft and hard telecine and  limited  support  for  movies  that  are
              slowed  down or sped up from their original framerate for TV.  Only the luma plane is used to find
              the frame breaks.  If a field has no match, it is deinterlaced with simple  linear  approximation.
              If  the  source is MPEG-2, this must be the first filter to allow access to the field-flags set by
              the MPEG-2 decoder.  Depending on the source MPEG, you may be fine ignoring this advice,  as  long
              as  you  do not see lots of "Bottom-first field" warnings.  With no options it does normal inverse
              telecine, and should be used together with mencoder -fps 30000/1001 -ofps 24000/1001.   When  this
              filter  is  used  with  MPlayer,  it will result in an uneven framerate during playback, but it is
              still generally better than using pp=lb or no deinterlacing at all.  Multiple options can be spec‐
              ified separated by <a href="file:/.">/.</a>

                 crop=&lt;w&gt;:&lt;h&gt;:&lt;x&gt;:&lt;y&gt;
                      Just like the crop filter, but faster, and works on mixed hard and soft telecined  content
                      as  well  as  when  y is not a multiple of 4.  If x or y would require cropping fractional
                      pixels from the chroma planes, the crop area is extended.  This usually means that x and y
                      must be even.

                 io=&lt;ifps&gt;:&lt;ofps&gt;
                      For each ifps input frames the filter will output ofps frames.   The  ratio  of  ifps/ofps
                      should match the -fps/-ofps ratio.  This could be used to filter movies that are broadcast
                      on TV at a frame rate different from their original framerate.

                 luma_only=&lt;n&gt;
                      If  n  is  nonzero, the chroma plane is copied unchanged.  This is useful for YV12 sampled
                      TV, which discards one of the chroma fields.

                 mmx2=&lt;n&gt;
                      On x86, if n=1, use MMX2 optimized functions, if n=2,  use  3DNow!   optimized  functions,
                      otherwise, use plain C.  If this option is not specified, MMX2 and 3DNow! are auto-detect‐
                      ed, use this option to override auto-detection.

                 fast=&lt;n&gt;
                      The  larger  n  will speed up the filter at the expense of accuracy.  The default value is
                      n=3.   If  n  is  odd,  a  frame  immediately  following  a  frame  marked  with  the  RE‐
                      PEAT_FIRST_FIELD  MPEG  flag  is assumed to be progressive, thus filter will not spend any
                      time on soft-telecined MPEG-2 content.  This is the only effect of this flag  if  MMX2  or
                      3DNow!  is  available.  Without MMX2 and 3DNow, if n=0 or 1, the same calculations will be
                      used as with n=2 or 3.  If n=2 or 3, the number of luma levels  used  to  find  the  frame
                      breaks  is  reduced  from 256 to 128, which results in a faster filter without losing much
                      accuracy.  If n=4 or 5, a faster, but much less accurate metric will be used to  find  the
                      frame  breaks,  which  is more likely to misdetect high vertical detail as interlaced con‐
                      tent.

                 verbose=&lt;n&gt;
                      If n is nonzero, print the detailed metrics for each frame.  Useful for debugging.

                 dint_thres=&lt;n&gt;
                      Deinterlace threshold.  Used during de-interlacing  of  unmatched  frames.   Larger  value
                      means less deinterlacing, use n=256 to completely turn off deinterlacing.  Default is n=8.

                 comb_thres=&lt;n&gt;
                      Threshold for comparing a top and bottom fields.  Defaults to 128.

                 diff_thres=&lt;n&gt;
                      Threshold to detect temporal change of a field.  Default is 128.

                 sad_thres=&lt;n&gt;
                      Sum of Absolute Difference threshold, default is 64.

       <b>softpulldown</b>
              This  filter works only correct with MEncoder and acts on the MPEG-2 flags used for soft 3:2 pull‐
              down (soft telecine).  If you want to use the ivtc or detc filter on movies that are  partly  soft
              telecined, inserting this filter before them should make them more reliable.

       <b>divtc[=options]</b>
              Inverse  telecine  for  deinterlaced  video.   If 3:2-pulldown telecined video has lost one of the
              fields or is deinterlaced using a method that keeps one field and interpolates the other, the  re‐
              sult is a juddering video that has every fourth frame duplicated.  This filter is intended to find
              and  drop  those  duplicates and restore the original film framerate.  When using this filter, you
              must specify -ofps that is 4/5 of the fps of the input file and place the softskip  later  in  the
              filter  chain to make sure that divtc sees all the frames.  Two different modes are available: One
              pass mode is the default and is straightforward to use, but has the disadvantage that any  changes
              in  the  telecine phase (lost frames or bad edits) cause momentary judder until the filter can re‐
              sync again.  Two pass mode avoids this by analyzing the whole video beforehand  so  it  will  have
              forward  knowledge  about the phase changes and can resync at the exact spot.  These passes do <b>not</b>
              correspond to pass one and two of the encoding process.  You must run an extra  pass  using  divtc
              pass  one  before the actual encoding throwing the resulting video away.  Use -nosound -ovc raw -o
              /dev/null to avoid wasting CPU power for this pass.  You may add something like crop=2:2:0:0 after
              divtc to speed things up even more.  Then use divtc pass two for the actual encoding.  If you  use
              multiple encoder passes, use divtc pass two for all of them.  The options are:

                 pass=1|2
                      Use two pass mode.

                 file=&lt;filename&gt;
                      Set the two pass log filename (default: "framediff.log").

                 threshold=&lt;value&gt;
                      Set  the  minimum  strength the telecine pattern must have for the filter to believe in it
                      (default: 0.5).  This is used to avoid recognizing false pattern from  the  parts  of  the
                      video that are very dark or very still.

                 window=&lt;numframes&gt;
                      Set the number of past frames to look at when searching for pattern (default: 30).  Longer
                      window improves the reliability of the pattern search, but shorter window improves the re‐
                      action  time  to  the changes in the telecine phase.  This only affects the one pass mode.
                      The two pass mode currently uses fixed window that extends to both future and past.

                 phase=0|1|2|3|4
                      Sets the initial telecine phase for one pass mode (default: 0).  The two pass mode can see
                      the future, so it is able to use the correct phase from the beginning, but one  pass  mode
                      can  only  guess.   It  catches the correct phase when it finds it, but this option can be
                      used to fix the possible juddering at the beginning.  The first pass of the two pass  mode
                      also  uses this, so if you save the output from the first pass, you get constant phase re‐
                      sult.

                 deghost=&lt;value&gt;
                      Set the deghosting threshold (0-255 for one pass mode, -255-255 for two pass mode, default
                      0).  If nonzero, deghosting mode is used.  This is for video that has been deinterlaced by
                      blending the fields together instead of dropping one of the fields.  Deghosting  amplifies
                      any  compression  artifacts  in  the  blended  frames, so the parameter value is used as a
                      threshold to exclude those pixels from deghosting that differ from the previous frame less
                      than specified value.  If two pass mode is used, then negative value can be used  to  make
                      the  filter  analyze  the  whole  video in the beginning of pass-2 to determine whether it
                      needs deghosting or not and then select either zero or the absolute value of  the  parame‐
                      ter.  Specify this option for pass-2, it makes no difference on pass-1.

       <b>phase[=t|b|p|a|u|T|B|A|U][:v]</b>
              Delay  interlaced video by one field time so that the field order changes.  The intended use is to
              fix PAL movies that have been captured with the opposite field order to the  film-to-video  trans‐
              fer.  The options are:

                 t    Capture field order top-first, transfer bottom-first.  Filter will delay the bottom field.

                 b    Capture bottom-first, transfer top-first.  Filter will delay the top field.

                 p    Capture  and transfer with the same field order.  This mode only exists for the documenta‐
                      tion of the other options to refer to, but if you actually  select  it,  the  filter  will
                      faithfully do nothing ;-)

                 a    Capture  field  order  determined automatically by field flags, transfer opposite.  Filter
                      selects among t and b modes on a frame by frame basis using field flags.  If no field  in‐
                      formation is available, then this works just like u.

                 u    Capture unknown or varying, transfer opposite.  Filter selects among t and b on a frame by
                      frame basis by analyzing the images and selecting the alternative that produces best match
                      between the fields.

                 T    Capture  top-first, transfer unknown or varying.  Filter selects among t and p using image
                      analysis.

                 B    Capture bottom-first, transfer unknown or varying.  Filter selects among b and p using im‐
                      age analysis.

                 A    Capture determined by field flags, transfer unknown or varying.  Filter selects among t, b
                      and p using field flags and image analysis.  If no field information  is  available,  then
                      this works just like U.  This is the default mode.

                 U    Both capture and transfer unknown or varying.  Filter selects among t, b and p using image
                      analysis only.

                 v    Verbose  operation.   Prints the selected mode for each frame and the average squared dif‐
                      ference between fields for t, b, and p alternatives.

       <b>telecine[=start]</b>
              Apply 3:2 'telecine' process to increase framerate by 20%.  This most likely will  not  work  cor‐
              rectly  with  MPlayer,  but  it  can  be  used with 'mencoder -fps 30000/1001 -ofps 30000/1001 -vf
              telecine'.  Both fps options are essential!  (A/V sync will break if they are wrong.)  The option‐
              al start parameter tells the filter where in the telecine pattern to start (0-3).

       <b>tinterlace[=mode]</b>
              Temporal field interlacing - merge pairs of frames into an interlaced frame, halving  the  framer‐
              ate.  Even frames are moved into the upper field, odd frames to the lower field.  This can be used
              to fully reverse the effect of the tfields filter (in mode 0).  Available modes are:
                 0    Move  odd frames into the upper field, even into the lower field, generating a full-height
                      frame at half framerate.
                 1    Only output odd frames, even frames are dropped; height unchanged.
                 2    Only output even frames, odd frames are dropped; height unchanged.
                 3    Expand each frame to full height, but pad alternate lines with black; framerate unchanged.
                 4    Interleave even lines from even frames with odd lines from odd frames.   Height  unchanged
                      at half framerate.

       <b>tfields[=mode[:field_dominance]]</b>
              Temporal  field  separation  -  split fields into frames, doubling the output framerate.  Like the
              telecine filter, tfields might not work completely right unless used with MEncoder and  both  -fps
              and -ofps set to the desired (double) framerate!

                      erwise it falls back to 0 (top field first).
                      0: top field first

                         0:    same as original

       <b>framestep=I|[i]step</b>
              Renders only every nth frame or every intra frame (keyframe).

              If you call the filter with I (uppercase) as the parameter, then <b>only</b> keyframes are rendered.  For
              DVDs  it generally means one in every 15/12 frames (IBBPBBPBBPBBPBB), for AVI it means every scene
              change or every keyint value (see -lavcopts keyint= value  if  you  use  MEncoder  to  encode  the
              video).

              When  a  keyframe is found, an 'I!' string followed by a newline character is printed, leaving the
              current line of MPlayer/MEncoder output on the screen, because it contains the time  (in  seconds)
              and frame number of the keyframe (You can use this information to split the AVI.).

              If  you  call  the  filter with a numeric parameter 'step' then only one in every 'step' frames is
              rendered.

              If you put an 'i' (lowercase) before the number then an 'I!' is printed (like the I parameter).

              If you give only the i then nothing is done to the frames, only I! is printed.

       <b>tile=xtiles:ytiles:output:start:delta</b>
              Tile a series of images into a single, bigger image.  If you omit a parameter or use a value  less
              than  0,  then  the  default  value  is  used.   You can also stop when you are satisfied (... -vf
              tile=10:5 ...).  It is probably a good idea to put the scale filter before the tile :-)

              The parameters are:

                 &lt;xtiles&gt;
                      number of tiles on the x axis (default: 5)
                 &lt;ytiles&gt;
                      number of tiles on the y axis (default: 5)
                 &lt;output&gt;
                      Render the tile when 'output' number of frames are reached, where  'output'  should  be  a
                      number  less  than  xtile * ytile.  Missing tiles are left blank.  You could, for example,
                      write an 8 * 7 tile every 50 frames to have one image every 2 seconds @ 25 fps.
                 &lt;start&gt;
                      outer border thickness in pixels (default: 2)
                 &lt;delta&gt;
                      inner border thickness in pixels (default: 4)

       <b>delogo[=x:y:w:h:t]</b>
              Suppresses a TV station logo by a simple interpolation of the surrounding pixels.  Just set a rec‐
              tangle covering the logo and watch it disappear (and sometimes something even uglier appear - your
              mileage may vary).

                 &lt;t&gt;  Thickness of the fuzzy edge of the rectangle (added to w and h).  When set to -1, a  green
                      rectangle is drawn on the screen to simplify finding the right x,y,w,h parameters.
                 file=&lt;file&gt;
                      You can specify a text file to load the coordinates from.  Each line must have a timestamp
                      (in seconds, and in ascending order) and the "x:y:w:h:t" coordinates (t can be omitted).

       <b>remove-logo=/path/to/logo_bitmap_file_name.pgm</b>
              Suppresses a TV station logo, using a PGM or PPM image file to determine which pixels comprise the
              logo.   The  width  and  height  of  the  image  file  must  match those of the video stream being
              processed.  Uses the filter image and a circular blur algorithm to remove the logo.

                 /path/to/logo_bitmap_file_name.pgm
                      [path] + filename of the filter image.

       <b>zrmjpeg[=options]</b>

                 maxheight=&lt;h&gt;|maxwidth=&lt;w&gt;
                      These options set the maximum width and height the zr card can handle (the MPlayer  filter
                      layer currently cannot query those).

                 {dc10+,dc10,buz,lml33}-{PAL|NTSC}
                      Use  these  options  to  set  maxwidth and maxheight automatically to the values known for
                      card/mode combo.   For  example,  valid  options  are:  dc10-PAL  and  buz-NTSC  (default:
                      dc10+PAL)

                 color|bw
                      Select  color  or black and white encoding.  Black and white encoding is faster.  Color is
                      the default.

                      By default, decimation is only performed if the Zoran hardware can upscale  the  resulting
                      MJPEG  images  to the original size.  The option fd instructs the filter to always perform
                      the requested decimation (ugly).

       <b>screenshot=prefix</b>
              Allows acquiring screenshots of the movie using slave mode commands that can be bound to keypress‐
              es.  See the slave mode documentation and the INTERACTIVE CONTROL section for details.  By default
              files named 'shotNNNN.png' will be saved in the working directory, using the first available  num‐
              ber  -  no  files will be overwritten.  Specify a prefix to change the name or location, e.g.  -vf
              screenshot=shots/now will save the files in the directory shots with  nowNNNN.png  as  name.   The
              filter  has no overhead when not used and accepts an arbitrary colorspace, so it is safe to add it
              to the configuration file.  Make sure that the screenshot filter is added after all other  filters
              whose effect you want to record on the saved image.  E.g. it should be the last filter if you want
              to have an exact screenshot of what you see on the monitor.

       <b>ass</b>
              Moves  SSA/ASS subtitle rendering to an arbitrary point in the filter chain.  Only useful with the
              -ass option.

              <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                 -vf ass,screenshot
                      Moves SSA/ASS rendering before the screenshot filter.  Screenshots  taken  this  way  will
                      contain subtitles.

       <b>blackframe[=amount:threshold]</b>
              Detect  frames that are (almost) completely black.  Can be useful to detect chapter transitions or
              commercials.  Output lines consist of the frame number of the detected frame,  the  percentage  of
              blackness, the frame type and the frame number of the last encountered keyframe.

                 &lt;amount&gt;
                      Percentage of the pixels that have to be below the threshold (default: 98).

                 &lt;threshold&gt;
                      Threshold below which a pixel value is considered black (default: 32).

                      <b>mr</b> <b>or</b> <b>mono_right</b>
                             mono output (right eye only)
                 <u>NOTE:</u>  To use either of the interleaved-rows output formats to display full-screen on a row-in‐
                 terleaved 3D display, you will need to scale the video to the correct height  first  using  the
                 "scale"  filter,  if  it is not already the right height.  Typically, that is 1080 rows (so use
                 e.g.  "-vf scale=1440:1080,stereo3d=sbsl:irl" for a 720p side-by-side encoded movie).

       <b>gradfun[=strength[:radius]]</b>
              Fix the banding artifacts that are sometimes introduced into nearly flat regions by truncation  to
              8bit colordepth.  Interpolates the gradients that should go where the bands are, and dithers them.

              This filter is designed for playback only.  Do not use it prior to lossy compression, because com‐
              pression tends to lose the dither and bring back the bands.

                 &lt;strength&gt;
                      Maximum  amount by which the filter will change any one pixel.  Also the threshold for de‐
                      tecting nearly flat regions (default: 1.2).

                 &lt;radius&gt;
                      Neighborhood to fit the gradient to.  Larger radius makes for smoother gradients, but also
                      prevents the filter from modifying pixels near detailed regions (default: 16).

       <b>fixpts[=options]</b>
              Fixes the presentation timestamps (PTS) of the frames.  By default, the PTS  passed  to  the  next
              filter is dropped, but the following options can change that:

                 print
                      Print the incoming PTS.

                 fps=&lt;fps&gt;
                      Specify a frame per second value.

                 start=&lt;pts&gt;
                      Specify an initial value for the PTS.

                 autostart=&lt;n&gt;
                      Uses  the  <u>n</u>th  incoming  PTS as the initial PTS.  All previous PTS are kept, so setting a
                      huge value or -1 keeps the PTS intact.

                 autofps=&lt;n&gt;
                      Uses the <u>n</u>th incoming PTS after the end of autostart to determine the framerate.

              <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                 -vf fixpts=fps=24000/1001,ass,fixpts
                      Generates a new sequence of PTS, uses it for ASS subtitles, then drops it.   Generating  a
                      new  sequence is useful when the timestamps are reset during the program; this is frequent
                      on DVDs.  Dropping it may be necessary to avoid confusing encoders.

              <u>NOTE:</u> Using this filter together with any sort of seeking (including -ss and EDLs) may make demons
              fly out of your nose.

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>ENCODING</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> <b>(MENCODER</b> <b>ONLY)</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-audio-delay</b> <b>&lt;any</b> <b>floating-point</b> <b>number&gt;</b>
              Delays either audio or video by setting a delay field in the header (default: 0.0).  This does not
              delay either stream while encoding, but the player will see the delay field and compensate accord‐
              ingly.  Positive values delay the audio, and negative values delay the video.  Note that  this  is
              the exact opposite of the -delay option.  For example, if a video plays correctly with -delay 0.2,
              you can fix the video with MEncoder by using -audio-delay -0.2.

              Currently,  this option only works with the default muxer (-of avi).  If you are using a different
              muxer, then you must use -delay instead.

       <b>-audio-density</b> <b>&lt;1-50&gt;</b>
              Number of audio chunks per second (default is 2 for 0.5s long audio chunks).
              <u>NOTE:</u> CBR only, VBR ignores this as it puts each packet in a new chunk.

       <b>-audio-preload</b> <b>&lt;0.0-2.0&gt;</b>
              Sets up the audio buffering time interval (default: 0.5s).

       <b>-fafmttag</b> <b>&lt;format&gt;</b>
              Can be used to override the audio format tag of the output file.

              <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                 -fafmttag 0x55
                      Will have the output file contain 0x55 (mp3) as audio format tag.

       <b>-ffourcc</b> <b>&lt;fourcc&gt;</b>
              Can be used to override the video fourcc of the output file.

              <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                 -ffourcc div3
                      Will have the output file contain 'div3' as video fourcc.

       <b>-force-avi-aspect</b> <b>&lt;0.2-3.0&gt;</b>
              Override the aspect stored in the AVI OpenDML vprp header.  This can be used to change the  aspect
              ratio with '-ovc copy'.

       <b>-frameno-file</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> <b>(DEPRECATED)</b>
              Specify  the  name  of  the audio file with framenumber mappings created in the first (audio only)
              pass of a special three pass encoding mode.
              <u>NOTE:</u> Using this mode will most likely give you A-V desync.  Do not use it.  It is kept for  back‐
              wards compatibility only and will possibly be removed in a future version.

       <b>-hr-edl-seek</b>
              Use  a more precise, but much slower method for skipping areas.  Areas marked for skipping are not
              seeked over, instead all frames are decoded, but only the necessary frames are encoded.  This  al‐
              lows starting at non-keyframe boundaries.
              <u>NOTE:</u> Not guaranteed to work right with '-ovc copy'.

       <b>-info</b> <b>&lt;option1:option2:...&gt;</b> <b>(AVI</b> <b>only)</b>
              Specify the info header of the resulting AVI file.

              Available options are:

       <b>-noencodedups</b>
              Do not attempt to encode duplicate frames in duplicate; always output zero-byte frames to indicate
              duplicates.  Zero-byte frames will be written anyway unless a filter or encoder capable  of  doing
              duplicate encoding is loaded.  Currently the only such filter is harddup.

       <b>-noodml</b> <b>(-of</b> <b>avi</b> <b>only)</b>

                 -of rawaudio
                      raw audio stream (no muxing - one audio stream only)

       <b>-ofps</b> <b>&lt;fps&gt;</b>
              Specify  a  frames per second (fps) value for the output file, which can be different from that of
              the source material.  Must be set for variable fps (ASF, some MOV) and progressive (30000/1001 fps

       <b>-vobsubout</b> <b>&lt;basename&gt;</b>
              Specify the basename for the output .idx and .sub files.  This turns off subtitle rendering in the
              encoded movie and diverts it to VOBsub subtitle files.

       <b>-vobsuboutid</b> <b>&lt;langid&gt;</b>
              Specify the language two letter code for the subtitles.  This overrides what is read from the  DVD

              The timestamps must be specified in ascending order.

              Since MEncoder does not send timestamps along the filter chain, you probably need to use the  fix‐
              pts filter for this option to work.

              Not  all codecs support forced key frames.  Currently, support is only implemented for the follow‐
              ing encoders: lavc, x264, xvid.

                      peg4, h263 will be very low quality, ratecontrol will be confused resulting in lower qual‐
                      ity and some decoders will not be able to decode it).

                 2    Recommended for normal mpeg4/mpeg1video encoding (default).

                 3    Recommended for h263(p)/msmpeg4.  The reason for preferring 3 over 2 is that 2 could  lead
                      to overflows.  (This will be fixed for h263(p) by changing the quantizer per MB in the fu‐
                      ture, msmpeg4 cannot be fixed as it does not support that.)

              Minimum  frame-level  Lagrange  multiplier  for  ratecontrol (default: 2.0).  Lavc will rarely use
              quantizers below the value of lmin.  Lowering lmin will make lavc  more  likely  to  choose  lower
              quantizers  for  some  frames, but not lower than the value of vqmin.  Likewise, raising lmin will
              make lavc less likely to choose low quantizers, even if vqmin would have allowed them.  You proba‐
              bly want to set lmin approximately equal to vqmin.  When adaptive quantization is in use, changing
              lmin/lmax may have less of an effect; see mblmin/mblmax.

              Constant  quantizer  / constant  quality  encoding  (selects fixed quantizer mode).  A lower value
              means better quality but larger files (default: -1).  In case of snow codec, value 0  means  loss‐
              less  encoding.   Since the other codecs do not support this, vqscale=0 will have an undefined ef‐
              fect.  1 is not recommended (see vqmin for details).

       <b>vqmax=&lt;1-31&gt;</b>
              Maximum quantizer, 10-31 should be a sane range (default: 31).

              Macroblock decision algorithm (high quality mode), encode each macro block in all modes and choose
              the best.  This is slow but results in better quality and file size.  When mbd is set to 1  or  2,
              the  value  of mbcmp is ignored when comparing macroblocks (the mbcmp value is still used in other
              places though, in particular the motion search algorithms).  If any  comparison  setting  (precmp,
              subcmp,  cmp,  or  mbcmp)  is nonzero, however, a slower but better half-pel motion search will be
              used, regardless of what mbd is set to.  If qpel is set, quarter-pel motion search  will  be  used
              regardless.
                 0    Use comparison function given by mbcmp (default).
                 1    Select the MB mode which needs the fewest bits (=vhq).

              25fps movie.  This is the recommended default for MPEG-4).  Most codecs require regular  keyframes
              in  order  to limit the accumulation of mismatch error.  Keyframes are also needed for seeking, as
              seeking is only possible to a keyframe - but keyframes need more space than other frames, so larg‐
              er numbers here mean slightly smaller files but less precise seeking.  0 is equivalent to 1, which
              makes every frame a keyframe.  Values &gt;300 are not recommended as the quality might be bad depend‐
              ing upon decoder, encoder and luck.  It is common for MPEG-1/2 to use values &lt;=30.

       <b>sc_threshold=&lt;-1000000000-1000000000&gt;</b>
              Threshold for scene change detection.  A keyframe is inserted by  libavcodec  when  it  detects  a
              scene  change.   You  can  specify the sensitivity of the detection with this option.  -1000000000
              means there is a scene change detected at every frame, 1000000000 means no scene changes  are  de‐
              tected (default: 0).

       <b>sc_factor=&lt;any</b> <b>positive</b> <b>integer&gt;</b>
              Causes  frames  with  higher  quantizers to be more likely to trigger a scene change detection and
              make libavcodec use an I-frame (default: 1).  1-16 is a sane range.  Values between 2  and  6  may
              yield  increasing  PSNR (up to approximately 0.04 dB) and better placement of I-frames in high-mo‐
              tion scenes.  Higher values than 6 may give very slightly better PSNR (approximately 0.01 dB  more
              than sc_factor=6), but noticably worse visual quality.

       <b>vb_strategy=&lt;0-2&gt;</b> <b>(pass</b> <b>one</b> <b>only)</b>
              strategy to choose between I/P/B-frames:
                 0    Always use the maximum number of B-frames (default).
                 1    Avoid B-frames in high motion scenes.  See the b_sensitivity option to tune this strategy.
                 2    Places B-frames more or less optimally to yield maximum quality (slower).  You may want to
                      reduce the speed impact of this option by tuning the option brd_scale.

       <b>b_sensitivity=&lt;any</b> <b>integer</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>0&gt;</b>
              Adjusts  how  sensitively  vb_strategy=1  detects  motion and avoids using B-frames (default: 40).
              Lower sensitivities will result in more B-frames.  Using more B-frames usually improves PSNR,  but
              too  many  B-frames  can  hurt  quality  in high-motion scenes.  Unless there is an extremely high
              amount of motion, b_sensitivity can safely be lowered below the default; 10 is a reasonable  value
              in most cases.

       <b>brd_scale=&lt;0-10&gt;</b>
              Downscales  frames for dynamic B-frame decision (default: 0).  Each time brd_scale is increased by
              one, the frame dimensions are divided by two, which improves speed by a factor of four.  Both  di‐
              mensions  of the fully downscaled frame must be even numbers, so brd_scale=1 requires the original
              dimensions to be multiples of four, brd_scale=2 requires multiples of eight, etc.  In other words,
              the dimensions of the original frame must both be divisible by 2^(brd_scale+1) with no remainder.

       <b>bidir_refine=&lt;0-4&gt;</b>
              Refine the two motion vectors used in bidirectional macroblocks, rather than re-using vectors from
              the forward and backward searches.  This option has no effect without B-frames.
                 0    Disabled (default).
                 1-4  Use a wider search (larger values are slower).

       <b>vpass=&lt;1-3&gt;</b>
              Activates internal two (or more) pass mode, only specify if you wish to use two (or more) pass en‐
              coding.
                 1    first pass (also see turbo)
                 2    second pass
                 3    Nth pass (second and subsequent passes of N-pass encoding)
              Here is how it works, and how to use it:
              The first pass (vpass=1) writes the statistics file.  You might want to deactivate some CPU-hungry
              options, like "turbo" mode does.
              In two pass mode, the second pass (vpass=2) reads the statistics file and bases ratecontrol  deci‐
              sions on it.
              In  N-pass  mode, the second pass (vpass=3, that is not a typo) does both: It first reads the sta‐
              tistics, then overwrites them.  You might want to backup divx2pass.log before doing this if  there
              is  any  possibility that you will have to cancel MEncoder.  You can use all encoding options, ex‐
              cept very CPU-hungry options like "qns".
              You can run this same pass over and over to refine the encode.  Each subsequent pass will use  the
              statistics  from the previous pass to improve.  The final pass can include any CPU-hungry encoding
              options.
              If you want a 2 pass encode, use first vpass=1, and then vpass=2.
              If you want a 3 or more pass encode, use vpass=1 for the first pass  and  then  vpass=3  and  then
              vpass=3 again and again until you are satisfied with the encode.

              huffyuv:
                 pass 1
                      Saves statistics.
                 pass 2
                      Encodes with an optimal Huffman table based upon statistics from the first pass.

       <b>turbo</b> <b>(two</b> <b>pass</b> <b>only)</b>
              Dramatically speeds up pass one using faster algorithms and disabling CPU-intensive options.  This
              will probably reduce global PSNR a little bit (around 0.01dB) and change individual frame type and
              PSNR a little bit more (up to 0.03dB).

       <b>aspect=&lt;x/y&gt;</b>
              Store  movie  aspect  internally,  just  like with MPEG files.  Much nicer than rescaling, because
              quality is not decreased.  Only MPlayer will play these files correctly, other players  will  dis‐
              play  them  with  wrong  aspect.  The aspect parameter can be given as a ratio or a floating point
              number.

              <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                 aspect=16/9 or aspect=1.78

       <b>autoaspect</b>
              Same as the aspect option, but automatically computes aspect, taking into account all the  adjust‐
              ments (crop/expand/scale/etc.) made in the filter chain.  Does not incur a performance penalty, so
              you can safely leave it always on.

              Bigger diamonds allow a wider search for the best motion vector, thus are  slower  but  result  in

              When  surrounding motion vectors are &lt;0,0&gt; and the motion estimation score of the current block is

              possibly make the encoded video look slightly better; raising mv0_threshold past  320  results  in
              diminished  PSNR  and visual quality.  Higher values speed up encoding very slightly (usually less

   <b>nuv</b> <b>(-nuvopts)</b>
       Nuppel video is based on RTJPEG and LZO.  By default frames are first encoded with RTJPEG and  then  com‐
       pressed  with  LZO, but it is possible to disable either or both of the two passes.  As a result, you can
       in fact output raw i420, LZO compressed i420, RTJPEG, or the default LZO compressed RTJPEG.
       <u>NOTE:</u> The nuvrec documentation contains some advice and examples about the settings to use for  the  most
       common TV encodings.

       <b>c=&lt;0-20&gt;</b>
              chrominance threshold (default: 1)

       <b>l=&lt;0-20&gt;</b>
              luminance threshold (default: 1)

       <b>lzo</b>
              Enable LZO compression (default).

       <b>nolzo</b>
              Disable LZO compression.

       <b>q=&lt;3-255&gt;</b>
              quality level (default: 255)

       <b>raw</b>
              Disable RTJPEG encoding.

       <b>rtjpeg</b>
              Enable RTJPEG encoding (default).

   <b>xvidenc</b> <b>(-xvidencopts)</b>
       There are three modes available: constant bitrate (CBR), fixed quantizer and two pass.

       <b>pass=&lt;1|2&gt;</b>
              Specify the pass in two pass mode.

       <b>turbo</b> <b>(two</b> <b>pass</b> <b>only)</b>
              Dramatically speeds up pass one using faster algorithms and disabling CPU-intensive options.  This
              will  probably  reduce global PSNR a little bit and change individual frame type and PSNR a little
              bit more.

       <b>bitrate=&lt;value&gt;</b> <b>(CBR</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>pass</b> <b>mode)</b>
              Sets the bitrate to be used in kbits/second if &lt;16000 or in bits/second if &gt;16000.  If &lt;value&gt;  is
              negative, Xvid will use its absolute value as the target size (in kBytes) of the video and compute
              the associated bitrate automagically (default: 687 kbits/s).

       <b>fixed_quant=&lt;1-31&gt;</b>
              Switch to fixed quantizer mode and specify the quantizer to be used.

       <b>zones=&lt;zone0&gt;[/&lt;zone1&gt;[/...]]</b> <b>(CBR</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>pass</b> <b>mode)</b>
              User  specified  quality  for  specific  parts  (ending,  credits,  ...).   Each  zone  is &lt;start-
              frame&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;,&lt;value&gt; where &lt;mode&gt; may be
                 q    Constant quantizer override, where value=&lt;2.0-31.0&gt; represents the quantizer value.
                 w    Ratecontrol weight override, where value=&lt;0.01-2.00&gt; represents the quality correction  in
                      %.

              <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                 zones=90000,q,20
                      Encodes all frames starting with frame 90000 at constant quantizer 20.
                 zones=0,w,0.1/10001,w,1.0/90000,q,20
                      Encode  frames 0-10000 at 10% bitrate, encode frames 90000 up to the end at constant quan‐
                      tizer 20.  Note that the second zone is needed to delimit the first zone,  as  without  it
                      everything up until frame 89999 would be encoded at 10% bitrate.

       <b>me_quality=&lt;0-6&gt;</b>
              This  option controls the motion estimation subsystem.  The higher the value, the more precise the
              estimation should be (default: 6).  The more precise the motion estimation is, the more  bits  can
              be saved.  Precision is gained at the expense of CPU time so decrease this setting if you need re‐
              altime encoding.

       <b>(no)qpel</b>
              MPEG-4 uses a half pixel precision for its motion search by default.  The standard proposes a mode
              where  encoders  are  allowed  to  use  quarter pixel precision.  This option usually results in a
              sharper image.  Unfortunately it has a great impact on bitrate and sometimes  the  higher  bitrate
              use  will  prevent it from giving a better image quality at a fixed bitrate.  It is better to test
              with and without this option and see whether it is worth activating.

       <b>(no)gmc</b>
              Enable Global Motion Compensation, which makes Xvid generate special frames (GMC-frames) which are
              well suited for Pan/Zoom/Rotating images.  Whether or not the use of this option will save bits is
              highly dependent on the source material.

       <b>(no)trellis</b>
              Trellis Quantization is a kind of adaptive quantization method that saves bits by modifying  quan‐
              tized  coefficients  to make them more compressible by the entropy encoder.  Its impact on quality
              is good, and if VHQ uses too much CPU for you, this setting can be a good alternative  to  save  a
              few bits (and gain quality at fixed bitrate) at a lesser cost than with VHQ (default: on).

       <b>(no)cartoon</b>
              Activate  this  if  your  encoded  sequence  is  an anime/cartoon.  It modifies some Xvid internal
              thresholds so Xvid takes better decisions on frame types and motion vectors for flat looking  car‐
              toons.

       <b>(no)chroma_me</b>
              The  usual motion estimation algorithm uses only the luminance information to find the best motion
              vector.  However for some video material, using the chroma planes can help  find  better  vectors.
              This setting toggles the use of chroma planes for motion estimation (default: on).

       <b>(no)chroma_opt</b>
              Enable a chroma optimizer prefilter.  It will do some extra magic on color information to minimize
              the  stepped-stairs  effect  on edges.  It will improve quality at the cost of encoding speed.  It
              reduces PSNR by nature, as the mathematical deviation to the original picture will get bigger, but
              the subjective image quality will raise.  Since it works with color information, you might want to
              turn it off when encoding in grayscale.

       <b>(no)hq_ac</b>
              Activates high-quality prediction of AC coefficients for intra frames from  neighbor  blocks  (de‐
              fault: on).

       <b>vhq=&lt;0-4&gt;</b>
              The motion search algorithm is based on a search in the usual color domain and tries to find a mo‐
              tion vector that minimizes the difference between the reference frame and the encoded frame.  With
              this  setting activated, Xvid will also use the frequency domain (DCT) to search for a motion vec‐
              tor that minimizes not only the spatial difference but also the  encoding  length  of  the  block.
              Fastest to slowest:
                 0    off
                 1    mode decision (inter/intra MB) (default)
                 2    limited search
                 3    medium search
                 4    wide search

       <b>(no)lumi_mask</b>
              Adaptive quantization allows the macroblock quantizers to vary inside each frame.  This is a 'psy‐
              chosensory'  setting  that  is supposed to make use of the fact that the human eye tends to notice
              fewer details in very bright and very dark parts of the picture.  It compresses those  areas  more
              strongly  than  medium ones, which will save bits that can be spent again on other frames, raising
              overall subjective quality and possibly reducing PSNR.

       <b>(no)grayscale</b>
              Make Xvid discard chroma planes so the encoded video is grayscale only.  Note that this  does  not
              speed up encoding, it just prevents chroma data from being written in the last stage of encoding.

       <b>(no)interlacing</b>
              Encode the fields of interlaced video material.  Turn this option on for interlaced content.
              <u>NOTE:</u> Should you rescale the video, you would need an interlace-aware resizer, which you can acti‐
              vate with -vf scale=&lt;width&gt;:&lt;height&gt;:1.

       <b>min_iquant=&lt;0-31&gt;</b>
              minimum I-frame quantizer (default: 2)

       <b>max_iquant=&lt;0-31&gt;</b>
              maximum I-frame quantizer (default: 31)

       <b>min_pquant=&lt;0-31&gt;</b>
              minimum P-frame quantizer (default: 2)

       <b>max_pquant=&lt;0-31&gt;</b>
              maximum P-frame quantizer (default: 31)

       <b>min_bquant=&lt;0-31&gt;</b>
              minimum B-frame quantizer (default: 2)

       <b>max_bquant=&lt;0-31&gt;</b>
              maximum B-frame quantizer (default: 31)

       <b>min_key_interval=&lt;value&gt;</b> <b>(two</b> <b>pass</b> <b>only)</b>
              minimum interval between keyframes (default: 0)

       <b>max_key_interval=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              maximum interval between keyframes (default: 10*fps)

       <b>quant_type=&lt;h263|mpeg&gt;</b>
              Sets  the  type of quantizer to use.  For high bitrates, you will find that MPEG quantization pre‐
              serves more detail.  For low bitrates, the smoothing of H.263 will  give  you  less  block  noise.
              When using custom matrices, MPEG quantization <b>must</b> be used.

       <b>quant_intra_matrix=&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Load a custom intra matrix file.  You can build such a file with xvid4conf's matrix editor.

       <b>quant_inter_matrix=&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Load a custom inter matrix file.  You can build such a file with xvid4conf's matrix editor.

       <b>keyframe_boost=&lt;0-1000&gt;</b> <b>(two</b> <b>pass</b> <b>mode</b> <b>only)</b>
              Shift some bits from the pool for other frame types to intra frames, thus improving keyframe qual‐
              ity.   This amount is an extra percentage, so a value of 10 will give your keyframes 10% more bits
              than normal (default: 0).

       <b>kfthreshold=&lt;value&gt;</b> <b>(two</b> <b>pass</b> <b>mode</b> <b>only)</b>
              Works together with kfreduction.  Determines the minimum distance below which  you  consider  that
              two  frames  are considered consecutive and treated differently according to kfreduction (default:
              10).

       <b>kfreduction=&lt;0-100&gt;</b> <b>(two</b> <b>pass</b> <b>mode</b> <b>only)</b>
              The above two settings can be used to adjust the size of keyframes that you consider too close  to
              the  first (in a row).  kfthreshold sets the range in which keyframes are reduced, and kfreduction
              determines the bitrate reduction they get.  The last I-frame will get treated  normally  (default:
              30).

       <b>max_bframes=&lt;0-4&gt;</b>
              Maximum number of B-frames to put between I/P-frames (default: 2).

       <b>bquant_ratio=&lt;0-1000&gt;</b>
              quantizer ratio between B- and non-B-frames, 150=1.50 (default: 150)

       <b>bquant_offset=&lt;-1000-1000&gt;</b>
              quantizer offset between B- and non-B-frames, 100=1.00 (default: 100)

       <b>bf_threshold=&lt;-255-255&gt;</b>
              This  setting allows you to specify what priority to place on the use of B-frames.  The higher the
              value, the higher the probability of B-frames being used (default: 0).   Do  not  forget  that  B-
              frames  usually have a higher quantizer, and therefore aggressive production of B-frames may cause
              worse visual quality.

       <b>(no)closed_gop</b>
              This option tells Xvid to close every GOP (Group Of Pictures bounded by two I-frames), which makes
              GOPs independent from each other.  This just implies that the last frame of the GOP is either a P-
              frame or a N-frame but not a B-frame.  It is usually a good idea to turn this option on  (default:
              on).

       <b>(no)packed</b>
              This  option is meant to solve frame-order issues when encoding to container formats like AVI that
              cannot cope with out-of-order frames.  In practice, most decoders (both software and hardware) are
              able to deal with frame-order themselves, and may get confused when this option is turned  on,  so
              you can safely leave if off, unless you really know what you are doing.
              <u>WARNING:</u> This will generate an illegal bitstream, and will not be decodable by ISO-MPEG-4 decoders
              except DivX/libavcodec/Xvid.
              <u>WARNING:</u> This will also store a fake DivX version in the file so the bug autodetection of some de‐
              coders might be confused.

       <b>frame_drop_ratio=&lt;0-100&gt;</b> <b>(max_bframes=0</b> <b>only)</b>
              This  setting  allows  the creation of variable framerate video streams.  The value of the setting
              specifies a threshold under which, if the difference of the following frame to the previous  frame
              is  below  or  equal to this threshold, a frame gets not coded (a so called n-vop is placed in the
              stream).  On playback, when reaching an n-vop the previous frame will be displayed.
              <u>WARNING:</u> Playing with this setting may result in a jerky video, so use it at your own risks!

       <b>rc_reaction_delay_factor=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              This parameter controls the number of frames the CBR rate controller will wait before reacting  to
              bitrate  changes and compensating for them to obtain a constant bitrate over an averaging range of
              frames.

       <b>rc_averaging_period=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Real CBR is hard to achieve.  Depending on the video material, bitrate can be variable,  and  hard
              to  predict.   Therefore  Xvid  uses an averaging period for which it guarantees a given amount of
              bits (minus a small variation).  This settings expresses the "number of frames" for which Xvid av‐
              erages bitrate and tries to achieve CBR.

       <b>rc_buffer=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              size of the rate control buffer

       <b>curve_compression_high=&lt;0-100&gt;</b>
              This setting allows Xvid to take a certain percentage of bits away from high  bitrate  scenes  and
              give them back to the bit reservoir.  You could also use this if you have a clip with so many bits
              allocated to high-bitrate scenes that the low(er)-bitrate scenes start to look bad (default: 0).

       <b>curve_compression_low=&lt;0-100&gt;</b>
              This  setting  allows  Xvid  to give a certain percentage of extra bits to the low bitrate scenes,
              taking a few bits from the entire clip.  This might come in handy if you have  a  few  low-bitrate
              scenes that are still blocky (default: 0).

       <b>overflow_control_strength=&lt;0-100&gt;</b>
              During  pass one of two pass encoding, a scaled bitrate curve is computed.  The difference between
              that expected curve and the result obtained during encoding is called  overflow.   Obviously,  the
              two  pass  rate  controller  tries  to compensate for that overflow, distributing it over the next
              frames.  This setting controls how much of the overflow is distributed every time there is  a  new
              frame.   Low  values  allow lazy overflow control, big rate bursts are compensated for more slowly
              (could lead to lack of precision for small clips).  Higher values will make changes in bit  redis‐
              tribution  more  abrupt,  possibly too abrupt if you set it too high, creating artifacts (default:
              5).
              <u>NOTE:</u> This setting impacts quality a lot, play with it carefully!

       <b>max_overflow_improvement=&lt;0-100&gt;</b>
              During the frame bit allocation, overflow control may increase the  frame  size.   This  parameter
              specifies  the  maximum  percentage by which the overflow control is allowed to increase the frame
              size, compared to the ideal curve allocation (default: 5).

       <b>max_overflow_degradation=&lt;0-100&gt;</b>
              During the frame bit allocation, overflow control may decrease the  frame  size.   This  parameter
              specifies  the  maximum  percentage by which the overflow control is allowed to decrease the frame
              size, compared to the ideal curve allocation (default: 5).

       <b>container_frame_overhead=&lt;0...&gt;</b>
              Specifies a frame average overhead per frame, in bytes.  Most of the time users express their tar‐
              get bitrate for video w/o taking care of the video container overhead.  This  small  but  (mostly)
              constant  overhead  can  cause  the target file size to be exceeded.  Xvid allows users to set the
              amount of overhead per frame the container generates (give only an average per frame).   0  has  a
              special meaning, it lets Xvid use its own default values (default: 24 - AVI average overhead).

       <b>par=&lt;mode&gt;</b>
              Specifies the Pixel Aspect Ratio mode (not to be confused with DAR,  the  Display  Aspect  Ratio).
              PAR  is the ratio of the width and height of a single pixel.  So both are related like this: DAR =
              PAR * (width/height).
              MPEG-4 defines 5 pixel aspect ratios and one extended one, giving the  opportunity  to  specify  a
              specific pixel aspect ratio.  5 standard modes can be specified:
                 vga11
                      It is the usual PAR for PC content.  Pixels are a square unit.

                 ext
                      Allows you to specify your own pixel aspect ratio with par_width and par_height.
              <u>NOTE:</u> In general, setting aspect and autoaspect options is enough.

       <b>par_width=&lt;1-255&gt;</b> <b>(par=ext</b> <b>only)</b>
              Specifies the width of the custom pixel aspect ratio.

       <b>par_height=&lt;1-255&gt;</b> <b>(par=ext</b> <b>only)</b>
              Specifies the height of the custom pixel aspect ratio.

       <b>aspect=&lt;x/y</b> <b>|</b> <b>f</b> <b>(float</b> <b>value)&gt;</b>
              Store  movie aspect internally, just like MPEG files.  Much nicer solution than rescaling, because
              quality is not decreased.  MPlayer and a few others players will play these files correctly,  oth‐
              ers  will  display  them with the wrong aspect.  The aspect parameter can be given as a ratio or a
              floating point number.

       <b>(no)autoaspect</b>
              Same as the aspect option, but automatically computes aspect, taking into account all the  adjust‐
              ments (crop/expand/scale/etc.) made in the filter chain.

       <b>psnr</b>
              Print  the  PSNR (peak signal to noise ratio) for the whole video after encoding and store the per
              frame PSNR in a file with a name like 'psnr_hhmmss.log' in the current directory.  Returned values
              are in dB (decibel), the higher the better.

       <b>debug</b>
              Save per-frame statistics in ./xvid.dbg. (This is not the two pass control file.)

       The following options are only available in Xvid 1.1.x and later.

       <b>bvhq=&lt;0|1&gt;</b>
              This setting allows vector candidates for B-frames to be used for the encoding chosen using a rate
              distortion optimized operator, which is what is done for P-frames by the vhq  option.   This  pro‐
              duces nicer-looking B-frames while incurring almost no performance penalty (default: 1).

       <b>vbv_bufsize=&lt;0...&gt;</b> <b>(two</b> <b>pass</b> <b>mode</b> <b>only)</b>
              Specify  the video buffering verifier (VBV) buffer size in bits (default: 0 - VBV check disabled).
              VBV allows restricting peak bitrate to make the video play properly on hardware players.  For  ex‐
              ample,  the  Home  profile  uses  vbv_bufsize=3145728.  If you set vbv_bufsize you should set also
              vbv_maxrate.  Note that there is no vbv_peakrate because Xvid does not actually use it for bitrate
              controlling; the other VBV options are enough to restrict the peak bitrate.

       <b>vbv_initial=&lt;0...vbv_bufsize&gt;</b> <b>(two</b> <b>pass</b> <b>mode</b> <b>only)</b>
              Specify the initial fill of the VBV buffer in bits (default: 75% of vbv_bufsize).  The default  is
              probably what you want.

       <b>vbv_maxrate=&lt;0...&gt;</b> <b>(two</b> <b>pass</b> <b>mode</b> <b>only)</b>
              Specify  the  maximum  processing rate in bits/s (default: 0).  For example, the Home profile uses
              vbv_maxrate=4854000.

       The following option is only available in Xvid 1.2.x and later.

       <b>threads=&lt;0-n&gt;</b>
              Create n threads to run the motion estimation (default: 0).  The maximum number  of  threads  that
              can be used is the picture height divided by 16.

   <b>x264enc</b> <b>(-x264encopts)</b>
       <b>bitrate=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Sets the average bitrate to be used in kbits/second (default: off).  Since local bitrate may vary,
              this  average  may  be  inaccurate  for  very short videos (see ratetol).  Constant bitrate can be
              achieved by combining this with vbv_maxrate, at significant reduction in quality.

       <b>qp=&lt;0-51&gt;</b>
              This selects the quantizer to use for P-frames.  I- and B-frames are offset  from  this  value  by
              ip_factor  and  pb_factor,  respectively.  20-40 is a useful range.  Lower values result in better
              fidelity, but higher bitrates.  0 is lossless.  Note that quantization in H.264 works  differently
              from  MPEG-1/2/4:  H.264's  quantization parameter (QP) is on a logarithmic scale.  The mapping is
              approximately H264QP = 12 + 6*log2(MPEGQP).  For example, MPEG at QP=2 is equivalent to  H.264  at
              QP=18.   Generally, this option should be avoided and crf should be used instead as crf will yield
              better visual results for the same size.

       <b>crf=&lt;1.0-50.0&gt;</b>
              Enables constant quality mode, and selects the quality.  The scale is similar to QP.  Like the bi‐
              trate-based modes, this allows each frame to use a different QP based on the  frame's  complexity.
              This option should generally be used instead of qp.

       <b>crf_max=&lt;float&gt;</b>
              With CRF and VBV, limit RF to this value (may cause VBV underflows!).

       <b>pass=&lt;1-3&gt;</b>
              Enable  2 or 3-pass mode.  It is recommended to always encode in 2 or 3-pass mode as it leads to a
              better bit distribution and improves overall quality.
                 1    first pass
                 2    second pass (of two pass encoding)
                 3    Nth pass (second and third passes of three pass encoding)
              Here is how it works, and how to use it:
              The first pass (pass=1) collects statistics on the video and writes them to  a  file.   You  might
              want to deactivate some CPU-hungry options, apart from the ones that are on by default.
              In  two  pass mode, the second pass (pass=2) reads the statistics file and bases ratecontrol deci‐
              sions on it.
              In three pass mode, the second pass (pass=3, that is not a typo) does both:  It  first  reads  the
              statistics,  then  overwrites  them.  You can use all encoding options, except very CPU-hungry op‐
              tions.
              The third pass (pass=3) is the same as the second pass, except that it has the second  pass'  sta‐
              tistics to work from.  You can use all encoding options, including CPU-hungry ones.
              The first pass may use either average bitrate or constant quantizer.  ABR is recommended, since it
              does not require guessing a quantizer.  Subsequent passes are ABR, and must specify bitrate.

              if  &gt;2  else unchanged} trellis=0 fast_pskip.  These settings significantly improve encoding speed
              while having little or no impact on the quality of the final pass.
              This option is implied with preset=placebo.

       <b>keyint=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Sets maximum interval between IDR-frames (default: 250).  Larger values save  bits,  thus  improve
              quality,  at  the  cost  of  seeking precision.  Unlike MPEG-1/2/4, H.264 does not suffer from DCT
              drift with large values of keyint.

       <b>keyint_min=&lt;1-keyint/2&gt;</b>
              Sets minimum interval between IDR-frames (default: auto).  If scenecuts appear within this  inter‐
              val,  they  are  still encoded as I-frames, but do not start a new GOP.  In H.264, I-frames do not
              necessarily bound a closed GOP because it is allowable for a P-frame to  be  predicted  from  more
              frames  than just the one frame before it (also see frameref).  Therefore, I-frames are not neces‐
              sarily seekable.  IDR-frames restrict subsequent P-frames from referring to any frame prior to the
              IDR-frame.

       <b>scenecut=&lt;-1-100&gt;</b>
              Controls how aggressively to insert extra I-frames (default: 40).  With small values of  scenecut,
              the  codec often has to force an I-frame when it would exceed keyint.  Good values of scenecut may
              find a better location for the I-frame.  Large values use more I-frames than necessary, thus wast‐
              ing bits.  -1 disables scene-cut detection, so I-frames are inserted only once every other  keyint
              frames,  even if a scene-cut occurs earlier.  This is not recommended and wastes bitrate as scene‐
              cuts encoded as P-frames are just as big as I-frames, but do not reset the "keyint counter".

       <b>(no)intra_refresh</b>
              Periodic intra block refresh instead of keyframes (default: disabled).  This option disables  IDR-
              frames,  and,  instead, uses a moving vertical bar of intra-coded blocks. This reduces compression
              efficiency but benefits low-latency streaming and resilience to packet loss.

       <b>frameref=&lt;1-16&gt;</b>
              Number of previous frames used as predictors in B- and P-frames (default: 3).  This  is  effective
              in anime, but in live-action material the improvements usually drop off very rapidly above 6 or so
              reference  frames.   This has no effect on decoding speed, but does increase the memory needed for
              decoding.  Some decoders can only handle a maximum of 15 reference frames.

       <b>bframes=&lt;0-16&gt;</b>
              maximum number of consecutive B-frames between I- and P-frames (default: 3)

       <b>(no)b_adapt</b>
              Automatically decides when to use B-frames and how many, up to the maximum  specified  above  (de‐
              fault: on).  If this option is disabled, then the maximum number of B-frames is used.

       <b>b_bias=&lt;-100-100&gt;</b>
              Controls the decision performed by b_adapt.  A higher b_bias produces more B-frames (default: 0).

       <b>b_pyramid=&lt;normal|strict|none&gt;</b>
              Allows  B-frames  to  be  used as references for predicting other frames.  For example, consider 3
              consecutive B-frames: I0 B1 B2 B3 P4.  Without this option, B-frames follow the  same  pattern  as
              MPEG-[124].   So  they  are  coded in the order I0 P4 B1 B2 B3, and all the B-frames are predicted
              from I0 and P4.  With this option, they are coded as I0 P4 B2 B1 B3.  B2 is the same as above, but
              B1 is predicted from I0 and B2, and B3 is predicted from B2  and  P4.   This  usually  results  in
              slightly  improved compression, at almost no speed cost.  However, this is an experimental option:
              it is not fully tuned and may not always help.  Requires bframes &gt;=  2.   Disadvantage:  increases
              decoding delay to 2 frames.
                 normal
                      Allow B-frames as references as described above (not Blu-ray compatible).
                 strict
                      Disallow  P-frames referencing B-frames. Gives worse compression, but is required for Blu-
                      ray compatibility.
                 none
                      Disable using B-frames as references.

       <b>(no)open_gop</b>
              Use recovery points to close GOPs; only available with bframes.

       <b>(no)bluray_compat</b>

       <b>(no)fake_interlaced</b>
              Flag stream as interlaced but encode progressive. Makes it posssible to encode 25p and 30p Blu-Ray
              streams. Ignored in interlaced mode.

                 0    Checkerboard - pixels are alternately from L and R.

                 5    Frame alternation - one view per frame.

       <b>(no)deblock</b>
              Use deblocking filter (default: on).  As it takes very little time compared to its  quality  gain,
              it is not recommended to disable it.

       <b>deblock=&lt;-6-6&gt;,&lt;-6-6&gt;</b>
              The  first  parameter  is AlphaC0 (default: 0).  This adjusts thresholds for the H.264 in-loop de‐
              blocking filter.  First, this parameter adjusts the maximum amount of change that  the  filter  is
              allowed  to cause on any one pixel.  Secondly, this parameter affects the threshold for difference
              across the edge being filtered.  A positive value reduces blocking artifacts more, but  will  also
              smear details.
              The  second  parameter  is  Beta  (default: 0).  This affects the detail threshold.  Very detailed
              blocks are not filtered, since the smoothing caused by the filter would be  more  noticeable  than
              the original blocking.
              The default behavior of the filter almost always achieves optimal quality, so it is best to either
              leave it alone, or make only small adjustments.  However, if your source material already has some
              blocking  or  noise  which  you would like to remove, it may be a good idea to turn it up a little
              bit.

       <b>(no)cabac</b>
              Use CABAC (Context-Adaptive Binary Arithmetic Coding) (default: on).  Slightly slows down encoding
              and decoding, but should save 10-15% bitrate.  Unless you are  looking  for  decoding  speed,  you
              should not disable it.

       <b>qp_min=&lt;1-51&gt;</b> <b>(ABR</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>pass)</b>

              maximum value by which the quantizer may be incremented/decremented between frames (default: 4)

       <b>(no)mbtree</b>
              Enable  macroblock  tree  ratecontrol (default: enabled).  Use a large lookahead to track temporal
              propagation of data and weight quality accordingly.  In multi-pass mode, this writes to a separate
              stats file named &lt;passlogfile&gt;.mbtree.

       <b>rc_lookahead=&lt;0-250&gt;</b>
              Adjust the mbtree lookahead distance (default: 40).  Larger values will be slower and  cause  x264
              to consume more memory, but can yield higher quality.

       <b>ratetol=&lt;0.1-100.0&gt;</b> <b>(ABR</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>pass)</b>

              abled)

       <b>vbv_init=&lt;0.0-1.0&gt;</b> <b>(ABR</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>pass)</b>

       <b>ip_factor=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              quantizer factor between I- and P-frames (default: 1.4)

              quantizer factor between P- and B-frames (default: 1.3)

       <b>qcomp=&lt;0-1&gt;</b> <b>(ABR</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>pass)</b>
              quantizer  compression  (default:  0.6).   A  lower value makes the bitrate more constant, while a
              higher value makes the quantization parameter more constant.

       <b>cplx_blur=&lt;0-999&gt;</b> <b>(two</b> <b>pass</b> <b>only)</b>
              Temporal blur of the estimated frame complexity, before curve compression  (default:  20).   Lower
              values  allow the quantizer value to jump around more, higher values force it to vary more smooth‐
              ly.  cplx_blur ensures that each I-frame has quality comparable to the following P-frames, and en‐
              sures that alternating high and low complexity frames (e.g. low fps animation) do not  waste  bits
              on fluctuating quantizer.

       <b>qblur=&lt;0-99&gt;</b> <b>(two</b> <b>pass</b> <b>only)</b>
              Temporal blur of the quantization parameter, after curve compression (default: 0.5).  Lower values
              allow the quantizer value to jump around more, higher values force it to vary more smoothly.

                 spatial
                      Motion vectors are extrapolated from neighboring blocks.  (default)
                 temporal
                      Motion vectors are extrapolated from the following P-frame.
                 auto The codec selects between spatial and temporal for each frame.
              Spatial and temporal are approximately the same speed and PSNR, the choice between them depends on
              the  video  content.   Auto  is slightly better, but slower.  Auto is most effective when combined
              with multipass.  direct_pred=none is both slower and lower quality.

       <b>weightp</b>
              Weighted P-frame prediction mode (default: 2).

       <b>(no)weight_b</b>
              Use weighted prediction in B-frames.  Without this option, bidirectionally  predicted  macroblocks
              give  equal  weight  to each reference frame.  With this option, the weights are determined by the
              temporal position of the B-frame relative to the references.  Requires bframes &gt; 1.

       <b>partitions=&lt;list&gt;</b>
              Enable some optional macroblock types (default: p8x8,b8x8,i8x8,i4x4).
                 p8x8 Enable types p16x8, p8x16, p8x8.
                 p4x4 Enable types p8x4, p4x8, p4x4.  p4x4 is recommended only with subq &gt;= 5, and only  at  low
                      resolutions.
                 b8x8 Enable types b16x8, b8x16, b8x8.
                 i8x8 Enable type i8x8.  i8x8 has no effect unless 8x8dct is enabled.
                 i4x4 Enable type i4x4.
                 all  Enable all of the above types.
                 none Disable all of the above types.
              Regardless of this option, macroblock types p16x16, b16x16, and i16x16 are always enabled.
              The idea is to find the type and size that best describe a certain area of the picture.  For exam‐
              ple,  a  global  pan  is better represented by 16x16 blocks, while small moving objects are better
              represented by smaller blocks.

       <b>(no)8x8dct</b>
              Adaptive spatial transform size: allows macroblocks to choose between 4x4 and 8x8 DCT.   Also  al‐
              lows the i8x8 macroblock type.  Without this option, only 4x4 DCT is used.

       <b>subq=&lt;0-11&gt;</b>
              Adjust subpel refinement quality.  This parameter controls quality versus speed tradeoffs involved
              in the motion estimation decision process.  subq=5 can compress up to 10% better than subq=1.
                 0    Runs  fullpixel  precision  motion estimation on all candidate macroblock types.  Then se‐

                 1    Does as 0, then refines the motion of that type to fast quarterpixel precision (fast).
                 2    Runs  halfpixel  precision  motion estimation on all candidate macroblock types.  Then se‐
                      lects the best type with SATD metric.  Then refines the motion of that type to fast  quar‐

                      Then selects the best type with SATD metric.  Then finishes  the  quarterpixel  refinement
                      for that type.
                 5    Runs  best  quality  quarterpixel  precision motion estimation on all candidate macroblock
                      types, before selecting the best type.  Also refines the two motion vectors used in  bidi‐
                      rectional  macroblocks  with SATD metric, rather than reusing vectors from the forward and
                      backward searches.
                 6    Enables rate-distortion optimization of macroblock types in I- and P-frames.
                 7    Enables rate-distortion optimization of macroblock types in all frames (default).

                 11   Full RD; disable all early terminations.
              In the above, "all candidates" does not exactly mean all enabled types: 4x4, 4x8,  8x4  are  tried
              only if 8x8 is better than 16x16.

       <b>(no)chroma_me</b>
              Takes  into account chroma information during subpixel motion search (default: enabled).  Requires
              subq&gt;=5.

       <b>(no)mixed_refs</b>
              Allows each 8x8 or 16x8 motion partition to independently select a reference frame.  Without  this
              option, a whole macroblock must use the same reference.  Requires frameref&gt;1.

       <b>deadzone_inter=&lt;0-32&gt;</b>
              Set the size of the inter luma quantization deadzone for non-trellis quantization  (default:  21).
              Lower values help to preserve fine details and film grain (typically useful for high bitrate/qual‐
              ity  encode),  while  higher  values  help filter out these details to save bits that can be spent
              again on other macroblocks and frames (typically useful for bitrate-starved encodes).  It is  rec‐
              ommended that you start by tweaking deadzone_intra before changing this parameter.

       <b>deadzone_intra=&lt;0-32&gt;</b>
              Set  the  size of the intra luma quantization deadzone for non-trellis quantization (default: 11).
              This option has the same effect as deadzone_inter except that it affects intra frames.  It is rec‐
              ommended that you start by tweaking this parameter before changing deadzone_inter.

       <b>(no)fast_pskip</b>
              Performs early skip detection in P-frames (default: enabled).  This usually improves speed  at  no
              cost, but it can sometimes produce artifacts in areas with no details, like sky.

       <b>(no)dct_decimate</b>
              Eliminate  dct  blocks  in P-frames containing only a small single coefficient (default: enabled).
              This will remove some details, so it will save bits that can be spent again on other frames, hope‐
              fully raising overall subjective quality.  If you are compressing non-anime content  with  a  high
              target bitrate, you may want to disable this to preserve as much detail as possible.

       <b>nr=&lt;0-100000&gt;</b>
              Noise  reduction,  0  means disabled.  100-1000 is a useful range for typical content, but you may
              want to turn it up a bit more for very noisy content (default: 0).   Given  its  small  impact  on
              speed,  you might want to prefer to use this over filtering noise away with video filters like de‐
              noise3d or hqdn3d.

       <b>chroma_qp_offset=&lt;-12-12&gt;</b>
              Use a different quantizer for chroma as compared to luma.  Useful values are in the  range  &lt;-2-2&gt;

                 0    disabled
                 1    Avoid moving bits between frames.
                 2    Move bits between frames (by default).

       <b>aq_strength=&lt;positive</b> <b>float</b> <b>value&gt;</b>
              Controls  how  much  adaptive quantization (AQ) reduces blocking and blurring in flat and textured
              areas (default: 1.0).  A value of 0.5 will lead to weak AQ and less details, when a value  of  1.5
              will lead to strong AQ and more details.

       <b>threads=&lt;0-16&gt;</b>
              Spawn threads to encode in parallel on multiple CPUs (default: 0).  This has a slight  penalty  to
              compression  quality.   0 or 'auto' tells x264 to detect how many CPUs you have and pick an appro‐
              priate number of threads.

       <b>(no)sliced_threads</b>
              Use slice-based threading (default: disabled).  Unlike normal threading, this option adds  no  en‐

       <b>sync_lookahead=&lt;0-250&gt;</b>
              Adjusts  the  size of the threaded lookahead buffer (default: 0).  0 or 'auto' tells x264 to auto‐
              matically determine buffer size.

       <b>(no)visualize</b>
              Enable  x264 visualizations during encoding.  If the x264 on your system supports it, a new window
              will be opened during the encoding process, in which x264 will attempt to present an  overview  of
              how each frame gets encoded.  Each block type on the visualized movie will be colored as follows:

       <b>dump_yuv=&lt;file</b> <b>name&gt;</b>
              Dump YUV frames to the specified file.  For debugging use.

                      B-block
              This  feature  can be considered experimental and subject to change.  In particular, it depends on
              x264 being compiled with visualizations enabled.  Note that as of writing this, x264 pauses  after
              encoding  and visualizing each frame, waiting for the user to press a key, at which point the next
              frame will be encoded.

   <b>xvfw</b> <b>(-xvfwopts)</b>
       Encoding with Video for Windows codecs is mostly obsolete unless you  wish  to  encode  to  some  obscure
       fringe codec.

       <b>codec=&lt;name&gt;</b>
              The name of the binary codec file with which to encode.

       <b>compdata=&lt;file&gt;</b>
              The name of the codec settings file (like firstpass.mcf) created by vfw2menc.

   <b>MPEG</b> <b>muxer</b> <b>(-mpegopts)</b>
       The  MPEG muxer can generate 5 types of streams, each of which has reasonable default parameters that the
       user can override.  Generally, when generating MPEG files, it is advisable to disable  MEncoder's  frame-
       skip code (see -noskip, -mc as well as the harddup and softskip video filters).

       <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                 format=mpeg2:tsaf:vbitrate=8000

       <b>format=&lt;mpeg1</b> <b>|</b> <b>mpeg2</b> <b>|</b> <b>xvcd</b> <b>|</b> <b>xsvcd</b> <b>|</b> <b>dvd</b> <b>|</b> <b>pes1</b> <b>|</b> <b>pes2&gt;</b>
              stream  format  (default:  mpeg2).   pes1  and pes2 are very broken formats (no pack header and no
              padding), but VDR uses them; do not choose them unless you know exactly what you are doing.

       <b>size=&lt;up</b> <b>to</b> <b>65535&gt;</b>
              Pack size in bytes, do not change unless you know exactly what you are doing (default: 2048).

       <b>muxrate=&lt;int&gt;</b>
              Nominal muxrate in kbit/s used in the pack headers (default: 1800 kb/s).  Will be updated as  nec‐
              essary in the case of 'format=mpeg1' or 'mpeg2'.

       <b>tsaf</b>
              Sets  timestamps  on all frames, if possible; recommended when format=dvd.  If dvdauthor complains
              with a message like "..audio sector out of range...", you probably did not enable this option.

       <b>interleaving2</b>
              Uses a better algorithm to interleave audio and video packets, based on  the  principle  that  the
              muxer will always try to fill the stream with the largest percentage of free space.

       <b>vdelay=&lt;1-32760&gt;</b>
              Initial video delay time, in milliseconds (default: 0), use it if you want to delay video with re‐
              spect to audio.  It doesn't work with :drop.

       <b>adelay=&lt;1-32760&gt;</b>
              Initial audio delay time, in milliseconds (default: 0), use it if you want to delay audio with re‐
              spect to video.

       <b>drop</b>
              When used with vdelay the muxer drops the part of audio that was anticipated.

       <b>vwidth,</b> <b>vheight=&lt;1-4095&gt;</b>
              Set the video width and height when video is MPEG-1/2.

       <b>vpswidth,</b> <b>vpsheight=&lt;1-4095&gt;</b>
              Set pan and scan video width and height when video is MPEG-2.

       <b>vaspect=&lt;1</b> <b>|</b> <b>4/3</b> <b>|</b> <b>16/9</b> <b>|</b> <b>221/100&gt;</b>
              Sets  the  display aspect ratio for MPEG-2 video.  Do not use it on MPEG-1 or the resulting aspect
              ratio will be completely wrong.

       <b>vbitrate=&lt;int&gt;</b>
              Sets the video bitrate in kbit/s for MPEG-1/2 video.

       <b>vframerate=&lt;24000/1001</b> <b>|</b> <b>24</b> <b>|</b> <b>25</b> <b>|</b> <b>30000/1001</b> <b>|</b> <b>30</b> <b>|</b> <b>50</b> <b>|</b> <b>60000/1001</b> <b>|</b> <b>60</b> <b>&gt;</b>
              Sets the framerate for MPEG-1/2 video.  This option will be ignored if used with the telecine  op‐
              tion.

       <b>telecine</b>
              Enables 3:2 pulldown soft telecine mode: The muxer will make the video stream look like it was en‐
              coded  at 30000/1001 fps.  It only works with MPEG-2 video when the output framerate is 24000/1001
              fps, convert it with -ofps if necessary.  Any other framerate is incompatible with this option.

       <b>film2pal</b>
              Enables FILM to PAL and NTSC to PAL soft telecine mode: The muxer will make the video stream  look
              like  it  was  encoded  at  25  fps.  It only works with MPEG-2 video when the output framerate is
              24000/1001 fps, convert it with -ofps if necessary.  Any other framerate is incompatible with this
              option.

       <b>tele_src</b> <b>and</b> <b>tele_dest</b>
              Enables arbitrary telecining using Donand Graft's DGPulldown code.  You need to specify the origi‐
              nal and the desired framerate; the muxer will make the video stream look like it  was  encoded  at
              the  desired  framerate.  It only works with MPEG-2 video when the input framerate is smaller than
              the output framerate and the framerate increase is &lt;= 1.5.

              <u>EXAMPLE:</u>
                 tele_src=25,tele_dest=30000/1001
                      PAL to NTSC telecining

       <b>vbuf_size=&lt;40-1194&gt;</b>
              Sets the size of the video decoder's buffer, expressed in kilobytes.  Specify it only if  the  bi‐
              trate  of  the  video stream is too high for the chosen format and if you know perfectly well what
              you are doing.  A too high value may lead to an unplayable movie, depending on the player's  capa‐
              bilities.  When muxing HDTV video a value of 400 should suffice.

       <b>abuf_size=&lt;4-64&gt;</b>
              Sets  the  size  of the audio decoder's buffer, expressed in kilobytes.  The same principle as for
              vbuf_size applies.

   <b>FFmpeg</b> <b>libavformat</b> <b>demuxers</b> <b>(-lavfdopts)</b>

       <b>probesize=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Maximum amount of data to probe during the detection phase.  In the case  of  MPEG-TS  this  value
              identifies the maximum number of TS packets to scan.

       <b>cryptokey=&lt;hexstring&gt;</b>

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       There are a number of environment variables that can be used to control the behavior of MPlayer and  MEn‐
       coder.

       <b>MPLAYER_CHARSET</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>-msgcharset)</b>
              Convert  console  messages  to  the  specified charset (default: autodetect).  A value of "noconv"
              means no conversion.

       <b>MPLAYER_HOME</b>
              Directory where MPlayer looks for user settings.

       <b>MPLAYER_VERBOSE</b> <b>(also</b> <b>see</b> <b>-v</b> <b>and</b> <b>-msglevel)</b>
              Set the initial verbosity level across all message modules (default: 0).  The resulting  verbosity
              corresponds to that of -msglevel 5 plus the value of MPLAYER_VERBOSE.

   <b>libaf:</b>
       <b>LADSPA_PATH</b>
              If  LADSPA_PATH  is  set, it searches for the specified file.  If it is not set, you must supply a
              fully specified pathname.  FIXME: This is also mentioned in the ladspa section.

   <b>libdvdcss:</b>
       <b>DVDCSS_CACHE</b>
              Specify a directory in which to store title key values.  This will speed up descrambling  of  DVDs
              which  are in the cache.  The DVDCSS_CACHE directory is created if it does not exist, and a subdi‐
              rectory is created named after the DVD's title or manufacturing date.  If DVDCSS_CACHE is not  set
              or  is  empty,  libdvdcss  will  use  the default value which is "${HOME}/.dvdcss/" under Unix and
              "C:\Documents and Settings\$USER\Application Data\dvdcss\" under Win32.  The special  value  "off"
              disables caching.

       <b>DVDCSS_METHOD</b>
              Sets  the  authentication  and  decryption method that libdvdcss will use to read scrambled discs.
              Can be one of title, key or disc.
                 key
                      is the default method.  libdvdcss will use a set of calculated player keys to try and  get
                      the disc key.  This can fail if the drive does not recognize any of the player keys.
                 disc
                      is  a  fallback  method when key has failed.  Instead of using player keys, libdvdcss will
                      crack the disc key using a brute force algorithm.  This process is CPU intensive  and  re‐
                      quires 64 MB of memory to store temporary data.
                 title
                      is  the  fallback  when all other methods have failed.  It does not rely on a key exchange
                      with the DVD drive, but rather uses a crypto attack to guess the title key.  On rare cases
                      this may fail because there is not enough encrypted data on the disc to perform a  statis‐
                      tical  attack,  but in the other hand it is the only way to decrypt a DVD stored on a hard
                      disc, or a DVD with the wrong region on an RPC2 drive.

       <b>DVDCSS_RAW_DEVICE</b>
              Specify the raw device to use.  Exact usage will depend on your operating system, the Linux utili‐
              ty to set up raw devices is <a href="../man8/raw.8.html">raw</a>(8) for instance.  Please note that on most operating systems,  us‐
              ing  a raw device requires highly aligned buffers: Linux requires a 2048 bytes alignment (which is
              the size of a DVD sector).

       <b>DVDCSS_VERBOSE</b>
              Sets the libdvdcss verbosity level.
                 0    Outputs no messages at all.
                 1    Outputs error messages to stderr.
                 2    Outputs error messages and debug messages to stderr.

       <b>DVDREAD_NOKEYS</b>
              Skip retrieving all keys on startup.  Currently disabled.

       <b>AUDIODEV</b>
              FIXME: Document this.

       <b>AUDIOSERVER</b>
              Specifies the Network Audio System server to which the nas audio output driver should connect  and
              the transport that should be used.  If unset DISPLAY is used instead.  The transport can be one of
              tcp and unix.  Syntax is tcp/&lt;somehost&gt;:&lt;someport&gt;, &lt;somehost&gt;:&lt;instancenumber&gt; or [unix]:&lt;instan‐
              cenumber&gt;.  The NAS base port is 8000 and &lt;instancenumber&gt; is added to that.

              <u>EXAMPLES:</u>
                 AUDIOSERVER=somehost:0
                      Connect to NAS server on somehost using default port and transport.
                 AUDIOSERVER=tcp/somehost:8000
                      Connect to NAS server on somehost listening on TCP port 8000.

       clipping.
