</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gpgconf</b> - Modify .gnupg home directories

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gpgconf</b> [<u>options</u>] <b>--list-components</b>
       <b>gpgconf</b> [<u>options</u>] <b>--list-options</b> <u>component</u>
       <b>gpgconf</b> [<u>options</u>] <b>--change-options</b> <u>component</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>gpgconf</b>  is a utility to automatically and reasonable safely query and modify configuration files in
       the ‘<u>.gnupg</u>’ home directory.  It is designed not to be invoked manually by the user, but automatically by
       graphical user interfaces (GUI). ([Please note that currently no locking is done,  so  concurrent  access
       should be avoided.  There are some precautions to avoid corruption with concurrent usage, but results may
       be  inconsistent  and some changes may get lost.  The stateless design makes it difficult to provide more
       guarantees.])

       <b>gpgconf</b> provides access to the configuration of one or  more  components  of  the  GnuPG  system.   These
       components  correspond  more  or less to the programs that exist in the GnuPG framework, like GPG, GPGSM,
       DirMngr, etc.  But this is not a strict one-to-one  relationship.   Not  all  configuration  options  are
       available  through  <b>gpgconf</b>.  <b>gpgconf</b> provides a generic and abstract method to access the most important
       configuration options that can feasibly be controlled via such a mechanism.

       <b>gpgconf</b> can be used to gather and change the options available in each component, and  can  also  provide
       their  default  values.   <b>gpgconf</b>  will  give  detailed type information that can be used to restrict the
       user's input without making an attempt to commit the changes.

       <b>gpgconf</b> provides the backend of a configuration editor.  The configuration  editor  would  usually  be  a
       graphical  user interface program that displays the current options, their default values, and allows the
       user to make changes to the options.  These changes can then be made active with <b>gpgconf</b> again.   Such  a
       program that uses <b>gpgconf</b> in this way will be called GUI throughout this section.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       One of the following commands must be given:

       <b>--list-components</b>
              List all components.  This is the default command used if none is specified.

       <b>--check-programs</b>
              List all available backend programs and test whether they are runnable.

       <b>--list-options</b> <u>component</u>
              List all options of the component <u>component</u>.

       <b>--change-options</b> <u>component</u>
              Change the options of the component <u>component</u>.

       <b>--check-options</b> <u>component</u>
              Check the options for the component <u>component</u>.

       <b>--apply-profile</b> <u>file</u>
              Apply the configuration settings listed in <u>file</u> to the configuration files.  If <u>file</u> has no suffix
              and no slashes the command first tries to read a file with the suffix <b>.prf</b> from the data directory
              (<b>gpgconf</b>  <b>--list-dirs</b>  <b>datadir</b>)  before  it  reads  the  file verbatim.  A profile is divided into
              sections using the bracketed  component name.  Each section then lists the option which  shall  go
              into the respective configuration file.

       <b>--apply-defaults</b>
              Update  all  configuration  files  with  values  taken from the global configuration file (usually
              ‘<u>/etc/gnupg/gpgconf.conf</u>’).  Note: This is a legacy mechanism.  Please  use  global  configuration
              files instead.

       <b>--list-dirs</b> <b>[</b><u>names</u><b>]</b>
       <b>-L</b>     Lists  the  directories used by <b>gpgconf</b>.  One directory is listed per line, and each line consists
              of a colon-separated list where the first field names the directory type (for example  <b>sysconfdir</b>)
              and  the  second field contains the percent-escaped directory.  Although they are not directories,
              the socket file names used by <b>gpg-agent</b> and <b>dirmngr</b> are printed as well.   Note  that  the  socket
              file  names and the <b>homedir</b> lines are the default names and they may be overridden by command line
              switches.  If <u>names</u> are given only the directories or file names specified by the list  names  are
              printed without any escaping.

       <b>--list-config</b> <b>[</b><u>filename</u><b>]</b>
              List  the global configuration file in a colon separated format.  If <u>filename</u> is given, check that
              file instead.

       <b>--check-config</b> <b>[</b><u>filename</u><b>]</b>
              Run a syntax check on the global configuration file.   If  <u>filename</u>  is  given,  check  that  file
              instead.

       <b>--query-swdb</b> <u>package_name</u> <b>[</b><u>version_string</u><b>]</b>
              Returns  the  current version for <u>package_name</u> and if <u>version_string</u> is given also an indicator on
              whether an update is available.  The actual  file  with  the  software  version  is  automatically
              downloaded and checked by <b>dirmngr</b>.  <b>dirmngr</b> uses a thresholds to avoid download the file too often
              and  it does this by default only if it can be done via Tor.  To force an update of that file this
              command can be used:

                gpg-connect-agent --dirmngr 'loadswdb --force' /bye

       <b>--reload</b> <b>[</b><u>component</u><b>]</b>
       <b>-R</b>     Reload all or the given component. This  is  basically  the  same  as  sending  a  SIGHUP  to  the
              component.   Components  which don't support reloading are ignored.  Without <u>component</u> or by using
              "all" for <u>component</u> all components which are daemons are reloaded.

       <b>--launch</b> <b>[</b><u>component</u><b>]</b>
              If the <u>component</u> is not already running, start it.  <b>component</b>  must  be  a  daemon.   This  is  in
              general  not  required  because  the  system  starts  these  daemons as needed.  However, external
              software making direct use of <b>gpg-agent</b> or <b>dirmngr</b> may use this command to ensure  that  they  are
              started.  Using "all" for <u>component</u> launches all components which are daemons.

       <b>--kill</b> <b>[</b><u>component</u><b>]</b>
       <b>-K</b>     Kill  the  given  component  that runs as a daemon, including <b>gpg-agent</b>, <b>dirmngr</b>, and <b>scdaemon</b>.  A
              <b>component</b> which does not run as a daemon will be ignored.  Using "all"  for  <u>component</u>  kills  all
              components  running  as  daemons.   Note  that  as of now reload and kill have the same effect for
              <b>scdaemon</b>.

       <b>--create-socketdir</b>
              Create a directory for sockets below <a href="file:/run/user">/run/user</a> or /var/run/user.  This is command is only required
              if a non default home directory is used and the <a href="file:/run">/run</a> based sockets shall be used.  For the default
              home directory GnuPG creates a directory on the fly.

       <b>--remove-socketdir</b>
              Remove a directory created with command <b>--create-socketdir</b>.

       <b>--unlock</b> <u>name</u>
       <b>--lock</b> <u>name</u>
              Remove a stale lock file hold for ‘<u>file</u>’.   The  file  is  expected  in  the  current  GnuPG  home
              directory.   This command is usually not required because GnuPG is able to detect and remove stale
              lock files.  Before using the command make sure that the  file  protected  by  the  lock  file  is
              actually  not  in  use.   The  lock command may be used to lock an accidentally removed lock file.
              Note that the commands have no effect on Windows because the mere existence of a  lock  file  does
              not mean that the lock is active.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options may be used:

       <b>-o</b> <u>file</u>
       <b>--output</b> <u>file</u>
              Write output to <u>file</u>.  Default is to write to stdout.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--verbose</b>
              Outputs  additional  information while running.  Specifically, this extends numerical field values
              by human-readable descriptions.

       <b>-q</b>
       <b>--quiet</b>
              Try to be as quiet as possible.

       <b>--homedir</b> <u>dir</u>
              Set the name of the home directory to <u>dir</u>. If this option is not used, the home directory defaults
              to ‘<u><a href="file:~/.gnupg">~/.gnupg</a></u>’.  It is only recognized when given on the command line.  It also overrides any  home
              directory  stated through the environment variable ‘<u>GNUPGHOME</u>’ or (on Windows systems) by means of
              the Registry entry <u>HKCU\Software\GNU\GnuPG:HomeDir</u>.

              On Windows systems it is possible to install GnuPG as a portable application.  In this  case  only
              this command line option is considered, all other ways to set a home directory are ignored.

       <b>--chuid</b> <u>uid</u>
              Change  the current user to <u>uid</u> which may either be a number or a name.  This can be used from the
              root account to get information on the GnuPG environment of the specified user or to start or kill
              daemons.  If <u>uid</u> is not the current UID a standard PATH is set and the envvar GNUPGHOME is  unset.
              To  override  the latter the option <b>--homedir</b> can be used.  This option has currently no effect on
              Windows.

       <b>-n</b>
       <b>--dry-run</b>
              Do not actually change anything.  This is currently only implemented for <b>--change-options</b> and  can
              be used for testing purposes.

       <b>-r</b>
       <b>--runtime</b>
              Only  used  together  with  <b>--change-options</b>.   If one of the modified options can be changed in a
              running daemon process, signal the running daemon to ask it  to  reparse  its  configuration  file
              after changing.

              This  means that the changes will take effect at run-time, as far as this is possible.  Otherwise,
              they will take effect at the next start of the respective backend programs.

       <b>--status-fd</b> <u>n</u>
              Write special status strings to the file descriptor <u>n</u>.  This program returns the  status  messages
              SUCCESS  or FAILURE which are helpful when the caller uses a double fork approach and can't easily
              get the return code of the process.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The command <b>--list-components</b> will list all components that can be configured with <b>gpgconf</b>.  Usually, one
       component will correspond to one  GnuPG-related  program  and  contain  the  options  of  that  program's
       configuration  file  that  can  be modified using <b>gpgconf</b>.  However, this is not necessarily the case.  A
       component might also be a group of selected options from several programs, or  contain  entirely  virtual
       options that have a special effect rather than changing exactly one option in one configuration file.

       A  component  is  a set of configuration options that semantically belong together.  Furthermore, several
       changes to a component can be made in an atomic way with a single operation.  The GUI could  for  example
       provide a menu with one entry for each component, or a window with one tabulator sheet per component.

       The command <b>--list-components</b> lists all available components, one per line.  The format of each line is:

       <u>name</u><b>:</b><u>description</u><b>:</b><u>pgmname</u><b>:</b>

       <b>name</b>   This field contains a name tag of the component.  The name tag is used to specify the component in
              all  communication  with  <b>gpgconf</b>.   The  name  tag is to be used <u>verbatim</u>.  It is thus not in any
              escaped format.

       <b>description</b>
              The <u>string</u> in this field contains a human-readable  description  of  the  component.   It  can  be
              displayed to the user of the GUI for informational purposes.  It is <u>percent-escaped</u> and <u>localized</u>.

       <b>pgmname</b>
              The  <u>string</u>  in  this  field  contains the absolute name of the program's file.  It can be used to
              unambiguously invoke that program.  It is <u>percent-escaped</u>.

       Example:
         $ gpgconf --list-components
         gpg:GPG for OpenPGP:/usr/local/bin/gpg2:
         gpg-agent:GPG Agent:/usr/local/bin/gpg-agent:
         scdaemon:Smartcard Daemon:/usr/local/bin/scdaemon:
         gpgsm:GPG for S/MIME:/usr/local/bin/gpgsm:
         dirmngr:Directory Manager:/usr/local/bin/dirmngr:

   <b>Checking</b> <b>programs</b>

       The command <b>--check-programs</b> is similar to <b>--list-components</b> but works on backend  programs  and  not  on
       components.   It  runs  each  program to test whether it is installed and runnable.  This also includes a
       syntax check of all config file options of the program.

       The command <b>--check-programs</b> lists all available programs, one per line.  The format of each line is:

       <u>name</u><b>:</b><u>description</u><b>:</b><u>pgmname</u><b>:</b><u>avail</u><b>:</b><u>okay</u><b>:</b><u>cfgfile</u><b>:</b><u>line</u><b>:</b><u>error</u><b>:</b>

       <b>name</b>   This field contains a name tag of the program which is identical to the  name  of  the  component.
              The  name  tag  is  to be used <u>verbatim</u>.  It is thus not in any escaped format.  This field may be
              empty to indicate a continuation of error descriptions for the last  name.   The  description  and
              pgmname fields are then also empty.

       <b>description</b>
              The  <u>string</u>  in  this  field  contains  a  human-readable description of the component.  It can be
              displayed to the user of the GUI for informational purposes.  It is <u>percent-escaped</u> and <u>localized</u>.

       <b>pgmname</b>
              The <u>string</u> in this field contains the absolute name of the program's file.   It  can  be  used  to
              unambiguously invoke that program.  It is <u>percent-escaped</u>.

       <b>avail</b>  The <u>boolean</u> <u>value</u> in this field indicates whether the program is installed and runnable.

       <b>okay</b>   The <u>boolean</u> <u>value</u> in this field indicates whether the program's config file is syntactically okay.

       <b>cfgfile</b>
              If  an error occurred in the configuration file (as indicated by a false value in the field <b>okay</b>),
              this field has the name of the failing configuration file.  It is <u>percent-escaped</u>.

       <b>line</b>   If an error occurred in the configuration file, this field has the  line  number  of  the  failing
              statement in the configuration file.  It is an <u>unsigned</u> <u>number</u>.

       <b>error</b>  If  an  error  occurred  in  the  configuration file, this field has the error text of the failing
              statement in the configuration file.  It is <u>percent-escaped</u> and <u>localized</u>.

       In the following example the <b>dirmngr</b> is not runnable and the configuration file of <b>scdaemon</b> is not okay.

         $ gpgconf --check-programs
         gpg:GPG for OpenPGP:/usr/local/bin/gpg2:1:1:
         gpg-agent:GPG Agent:/usr/local/bin/gpg-agent:1:1:
         scdaemon:Smartcard Daemon:/usr/local/bin/scdaemon:1:0:
         gpgsm:GPG for S/MIME:/usr/local/bin/gpgsm:1:1:
         dirmngr:Directory Manager:/usr/local/bin/dirmngr:0:0:

       The command configuration file in the same  manner  as  <b>--check-programs</b>,  but  only  for  the  component
       <u>component</u>.

   <b>Listing</b> <b>options</b>

       Every  component  contains  one or more options.  Options may be gathered into option groups to allow the
       GUI to give visual hints to the user about which options are related.

       The command  lists all options (and the groups they belong to) in the component <u>component</u>, one per  line.
       <u>component</u> must be the string in the field <u>name</u> in the output of the <b>--list-components</b> command.

       There  is  one  line  for  each option and each group.  First come all options that are not in any group.
       Then comes a line describing a group.  Then come all options that belong into each group.  Then comes the
       next group and so on.  There does not need to be any group (and in this case the output will  stop  after
       the last non-grouped option).

       The format of each line is:

       <u>name</u><b>:</b><u>flags</u><b>:</b><u>level</u><b>:</b><u>description</u><b>:</b><u>type</u><b>:</b><u>alt-type</u><b>:</b><u>argname</u><b>:</b><u>default</u><b>:</b><u>argdef</u><b>:</b><u>value</u>

       <b>name</b>   This field contains a name tag for the group or option.  The name tag is used to specify the group
              or option in all communication with <b>gpgconf</b>.  The name tag is to be used <u>verbatim</u>.  It is thus not
              in any escaped format.

       <b>flags</b>  The  flags  field  contains  an  <u>unsigned</u>  <u>number</u>.   Its  value  is the OR-wise combination of the
              following flag values:

              <b>group</b> <b>(1)</b>
                     If this flag is set, this is a line describing a group and not an option.

       The following flag values are only defined for options (that is, if the <b>group</b> flag is not used).

              <b>optional</b> <b>arg</b> <b>(2)</b>
                     If this flag is set, the argument is optional.   This  is  never  set  for  <u>type</u>  <b>0</b>  (none)
                     options.

              <b>list</b> <b>(4)</b>
                     If this flag is set, the option can be given multiple times.

              <b>runtime</b> <b>(8)</b>
                     If this flag is set, the option can be changed at runtime.

              <b>default</b> <b>(16)</b>
                     If this flag is set, a default value is available.

              <b>default</b> <b>desc</b> <b>(32)</b>
                     If  this  flag  is  set,  a  (runtime) default is available.  This and the <b>default</b> flag are
                     mutually exclusive.

              <b>no</b> <b>arg</b> <b>desc</b> <b>(64)</b>
                     If this flag is set, and the <b>optional</b> <b>arg</b> flag is  set,  then  the  option  has  a  special
                     meaning if no argument is given.

              <b>no</b> <b>change</b> <b>(128)</b>
                     If  this  flag  is set, <b>gpgconf</b> ignores requests to change the value.  GUI frontends should
                     grey out this option.  Note, that manual changes  of  the  configuration  files  are  still
                     possible.

       <b>level</b>  This  field  is defined for options and for groups.  It contains an <u>unsigned</u> <u>number</u> that specifies
              the expert level under which this group or option  should  be  displayed.   The  following  expert
              levels are defined for options (they have analogous meaning for groups):

              <b>basic</b> <b>(0)</b>
                     This option should always be offered to the user.

              <b>advanced</b> <b>(1)</b>
                     This option may be offered to advanced users.

              <b>expert</b> <b>(2)</b>
                     This option should only be offered to expert users.

              <b>invisible</b> <b>(3)</b>
                     This option should normally never be displayed, not even to expert users.

              <b>internal</b> <b>(4)</b>
                     This option is for internal use only.  Ignore it.

       The level of a group will always be the lowest level of all options it contains.

       <b>description</b>
              This  field is defined for options and groups.  The <u>string</u> in this field contains a human-readable
              description of the option or group.  It can be displayed to the user of the GUI for  informational
              purposes.  It is <u>percent-escaped</u> and <u>localized</u>.

       <b>type</b>   This field is only defined for options.  It contains an <u>unsigned</u> <u>number</u> that specifies the type of
              the option's argument, if any.  The following types are defined:

              Basic types:

              <b>none</b> <b>(0)</b>
                     No argument allowed.

              <b>string</b> <b>(1)</b>
                     An <u>unformatted</u> <u>string</u>.

              <b>int32</b> <b>(2)</b>
                     A <u>signed</u> <u>number</u>.

              <b>uint32</b> <b>(3)</b>
                     An <u>unsigned</u> <u>number</u>.

       Complex types:

              <b>pathname</b> <b>(32)</b>
                     A  <u>string</u>  that  describes  the  pathname of a file.  The file does not necessarily need to
                     exist.

              <b>ldap</b> <b>server</b> <b>(33)</b>
                     A <u>string</u> that describes an LDAP server in the format:

                     <u>hostname</u><b>:</b><u>port</u><b>:</b><u>username</u><b>:</b><u>password</u><b>:</b><u>base_dn</u>

              <b>key</b> <b>fingerprint</b> <b>(34)</b>
                     A <u>string</u> with a 40 digit fingerprint specifying a certificate.

              <b>pub</b> <b>key</b> <b>(35)</b>
                     A <u>string</u> that describes a certificate by user ID, key ID or fingerprint.

              <b>sec</b> <b>key</b> <b>(36)</b>
                     A <u>string</u> that describes a certificate with a key by user ID, key ID or fingerprint.

              <b>alias</b> <b>list</b> <b>(37)</b>
                     A <u>string</u> that describes an alias list, like the one used with gpg's group option.  The list
                     consists of a key, an equal sign and space separated values.

       More types will be added in the future.  Please see the <u>alt-type</u> field for information  on  how  to  cope
       with unknown types.

       <b>alt-type</b>
              This  field  is  identical  to  <u>type</u>,  except that only the types <b>0</b> to <b>31</b> are allowed.  The GUI is
              expected to present the user the option in the format specified by <u>type</u>.  But if the argument type
              <u>type</u> is not supported by the GUI, it can still display the option in the more generic  basic  type
              <u>alt-type</u>.   The  GUI  must  support all the defined basic types to be able to display all options.
              More basic types may be added in future versions.  If the GUI encounters a basic type  it  doesn't
              support, it should report an error and abort the operation.

       <b>argname</b>
              This  field is only defined for options with an argument type <u>type</u> that is not <b>0</b>.  In this case it
              may contain a <u>percent-escaped</u> and <u>localized</u> <u>string</u> that gives a short name for the argument.   The
              field may also be empty, though, in which case a short name is not known.

       <b>default</b>
              This  field is defined only for options for which the <b>default</b> or <b>default</b> <b>desc</b> flag is set.  If the
              <b>default</b> flag is set, its format is that of an <u>option</u>  <u>argument</u>  (see:  [Format  conventions],  for
              details).   If  the  default  value  is  empty,  then  no  default is known.  Otherwise, the value
              specifies the default value for this option.  If the <b>default</b> <b>desc</b> flag is set, the field is either
              empty or contains a description of the effect if the option is not given.

       <b>argdef</b> This field is defined only for options for which the <b>optional</b> <b>arg</b> flag is set.  If the <b>no</b> <b>arg</b> <b>desc</b>
              flag is not set, its format is  that  of  an  <u>option</u>  <u>argument</u>  (see:  [Format  conventions],  for
              details).   If  the  default  value  is  empty,  then  no  default is known.  Otherwise, the value
              specifies the default argument for this option.  If the <b>no</b> <b>arg</b> <b>desc</b> flag  is  set,  the  field  is
              either empty or contains a description of the effect of this option if no argument is given.

       <b>value</b>  This  field  is  defined  only  for  options.  Its format is that of an <u>option</u> <u>argument</u>.  If it is
              empty, then the option is not explicitly set in the current configuration, and the default applies
              (if any).  Otherwise, it contains the current value of the option.  Note that this field  is  also
              meaningful  if  the  option  itself  does  not take a real argument (in this case, it contains the
              number of times the option appears).

   <b>Changing</b> <b>options</b>

       The command to change the options of the component <u>component</u> to the specified values.  <u>component</u> must  be
       the  string  in  the  field <u>name</u> in the output of the <b>--list-components</b> command.  You have to provide the
       options that shall be changed in the following format on standard input:

       <u>name</u><b>:</b><u>flags</u><b>:</b><u>new-value</u>

       <b>name</b>   This is the name of the option to change.  <u>name</u> must be the string in the field <u>name</u> in the output
              of the <b>--list-options</b> command.

       <b>flags</b>  The flags field contains an <u>unsigned</u>  <u>number</u>.   Its  value  is  the  OR-wise  combination  of  the
              following flag values:

              <b>default</b> <b>(16)</b>
                     If  this  flag  is  set,  the  option  is deleted and the default value is used instead (if
                     applicable).

       <b>new-value</b>
              The new value for the option.  This field is only defined if the <b>default</b> flag  is  not  set.   The
              format  is  that  of  an  <u>option</u>  <u>argument</u>.  If it is empty (or the field is omitted), the default
              argument is used (only allowed if the argument is  optional  for  this  option).   Otherwise,  the
              option will be set to the specified value.

       The output of the command is the same as that of <b>--check-options</b> for the modified configuration file.

       Examples:

       To set the force option, which is of basic type <b>none</b> <b>(0)</b>:

         $ echo 'force:0:1' | gpgconf --change-options dirmngr

       To delete the force option:

         $ echo 'force:16:' | gpgconf --change-options dirmngr

       The <b>--runtime</b> option can influence when the changes take effect.

   <b>Listing</b> <b>global</b> <b>options</b>

       Some  legacy  applications look at the global configuration file for the gpgconf tool itself; this is the
       file ‘<u>gpgconf.conf</u>’.  Modern applications should not use it but use per  component  global  configuration
       files which are more flexible than the ‘<u>gpgconf.conf</u>’.  Using both files is not suggested.

       The  colon  separated  listing  format is record oriented and uses the first field to identify the record
       type:

       <b>k</b>      This describes a key record to start the definition of a new ruleset for a user/group.  The format
              of a key record is:

                <b>k:</b><u>user</u><b>:</b><u>group</u><b>:</b>

              <b>user</b>   This is the user field of the key.  It is percent  escaped.   See  the  definition  of  the
                     gpgconf.conf format for details.

              <b>group</b>  This is the group field of the key.  It is percent escaped.

       <b>r</b>      This  describes  a  rule record. All rule records up to the next key record make up a rule set for
              that key.  The format of a rule record is:

                <b>r:::</b><u>component</u><b>:</b><u>option</u><b>:</b><u>flag</u><b>:</b><u>value</u><b>:</b>

              <b>component</b>
                     This is the component part of a rule.  It is a plain string.

              <b>option</b> This is the option part of a rule.  It is a plain string.

              <b>flag</b>   This is the flags part of a rule.  There may be only one flag per rule  but  by  using  the
                     same  component  and  option,  several  flags  may be assigned to an option.  It is a plain
                     string.

              <b>value</b>  This is the optional value for the option.  It is a percent escaped string  with  a  single
                     quotation  mark  to  indicate a string.  The quotation mark is only required to distinguish
                     between no value specified and an empty string.

       Unknown record types should be ignored.  Note that there is intentionally no feature to change the global
       option file through <b>gpgconf</b>.

   <b>Get</b> <b>and</b> <b>compare</b> <b>software</b> <b>versions.</b>

       The GnuPG Project operates a server to query the current versions of software packages related to  GnuPG.
       <b>gpgconf</b>  can be used to access this online database.  To allow for offline operations, this feature works
       by having <b>dirmngr</b> download a file from <b>https://versions.gnupg.org</b>, checking the signature  of  that  file
       and  storing the file in the GnuPG home directory.  If <b>gpgconf</b> is used and <b>dirmngr</b> is running, it may ask
       <b>dirmngr</b> to refresh that file before itself uses the file.

       The command <b>--query-swdb</b> returns information for the given package in a colon delimited format:

       <b>name</b>   This is the name of the package as requested.  Note that  "gnupg"  is  a  special  name  which  is
              replaced  by  the actual package implementing this version of GnuPG.  For this name it is also not
              required to specify a version because <b>gpgconf</b> takes its own version in this case.

       <b>iversion</b>
              The currently installed version or an empty string.  The value is  taken  from  the  command  line
              argument but may be provided by gpg if not given.

       <b>status</b> The status of the software package according to this table:

              <b>-</b>      No  information available.  This is either because no current version has been specified or
                     due to an error.

              <b>?</b>      The given name is not known in the online database.

              <b>u</b>      An update of the software is available.

              <b>c</b>      The installed version of the software is current.

              <b>n</b>      The installed version is already newer than the released version.

       <b>urgency</b>
              If the value (the empty string should be considered as zero) is greater  than  zero  an  important
              update is available.

       <b>error</b>  This returns an <b>gpg-error</b> error code to distinguish between various failure modes.

       <b>filedate</b>
              This gives the date of the file with the version numbers in standard ISO format (<b>yyyymmddThhmmss</b>).
              The date has been extracted by <b>dirmngr</b> from the signature of the file.

       <b>verified</b>
              This gives the date in ISO format the file was downloaded.  This value can be used to evaluate the
              freshness of the information.

       <b>version</b>
              This returns the version string for the requested software from the file.

       <b>reldate</b>
              This returns the release date in ISO format.

       <b>size</b>   This returns the size of the package as decimal number of bytes.

       <b>hash</b>   This returns a hexified SHA-2 hash of the package.

       More fields may be added in future to the output.

       <b>gpgconf.ctl</b>
                Under Unix ‘<u>gpgconf.ctl</u>’ may be used to change some of the
                compiled in directories where the GnuPG components are expected.  This
                file is expected in the same directory as ‘<u>gpgconf</u>’.  The
                physical installation directories are evaluated and no symlinks.
                Blank lines and lines starting with pound sign are ignored in the
                file.  The keywords must be followed by optional white space, an equal
                sign, optional white space, and the value.  Environment variables are
                substituted in standard shell manner, the final value must start with
                a slash, trailing slashes are stripped.  Valid keywords are
                <b>rootdir</b>, <b>sysconfdir</b>, <b>socketdir</b>, and
                <b>.enable</b>.  No errors are printed for unknown keywords.  The
                <b>.enable</b> keyword is special: if the keyword is used and its
                value evaluates to true the entire file is ignored.

                Under Windows this file is used to install GnuPG as a portable
                application.  An empty file named ‘<u>gpgconf.ctl</u>’ is expected in
                the same directory as the tool ‘<u>gpgconf.exe</u>’.  The root of the
                installation is then that directory; or, if ‘<u>gpgconf.exe</u>’ has
                been installed directly below a directory named ‘<u>bin</u>’, its parent
                directory.  You also need to make sure that the following directories
                exist and are writable: ‘<u>ROOT/home</u>’ for the GnuPG home and
                ‘<u>ROOT/var/cache/gnupg</u>’ for internal cache files.

       <b>/etc/gnupg/gpgconf.conf</b>
                If this file exists, it is processed as a global configuration file.
                This is a legacy mechanism which should not be used together with
                the modern global per component configuration files.  A commented
                example can be found in the ‘<u>examples</u>’ directory of the
                distribution.

       <u>GNUPGHOME</u><b>/swdb.lst</b>
                A file with current software versions.  <b>dirmngr</b> creates
