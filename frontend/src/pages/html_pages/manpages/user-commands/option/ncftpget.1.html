       <b>ncftpget</b> -c [<u>options</u>] <u><a href="ftp://url.style.host/path/name">ftp://url.style.host/path/name</a></u> &gt; stdout

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Command</b> <b>line</b> <b>flags:</b>
       <b>-u</b> <u>XX</u>   Use username <u>XX</u> instead of anonymous.

       <b>-p</b> <u>XX</u>   Use password <u>XX</u> with the username.

       <b>-P</b> <u>XX</u>   Use port number <u>XX</u> instead of the default FTP service port (21).

       <b>-j</b> <u>XX</u>   Use account <u>XX</u> in supplement to the username and password (deprecated).

       <b>-d</b> <u>XX</u>   Use the file <u>XX</u> for debug logging.

       <b>-a</b>      Use ASCII transfer type instead of binary.

       <b>-t</b> <u>XX</u>   Timeout after <u>XX</u> seconds.

       <b>-v</b>/<b>-V</b>   Do (do not) use progress meters.  The default is to use progress meters if the output stream is a
               TTY.

       <b>-f</b> <u>XX</u>   Read the file <u>XX</u> for host, user, and password information.

       <b>-c</b>      Read from remote host and write locally to standard out.

       <b>-C</b>      Read from remote host and write locally to specified pathname.

       <b>-A</b>      Append to local files, instead of overwriting them.

       <b>-z</b>/<b>-Z</b>   Do (do not) try to resume transfers.  The default is to try to resume (-z).

       <b>-E</b>      Use regular (PORT) data connections.

       <b>-F</b>      Use  passive  (PASV) data connections.  The default is to use passive, but to fallback to regular
               if the passive connection fails or times out.

       <b>-DD</b>     Delete remote file after successfully downloading it.

       <b>-R</b>      Recursive mode; copy whole directory trees.

       <b>-T</b>      Do not use automatic on-the-fly TAR mode for downloading whole directory  trees.   <u>ncftpget</u>  uses
               TAR whenever possible since this usually preserves symbolic links and file permissions.  TAR mode
               can  also  result in faster transfers for directories containing many small files, since a single
               data connection can be used rather than an FTP data connection for each small file.  The downside
               to using TAR is that it forces downloading of the whole directory, even  if  you  had  previously
               downloaded  a  portion  of  it  earlier, so you may want to use this option if you want to resume
               downloading of a directory.

       <b>-r</b> <u>XX</u>   Redial a maximum of <u>XX</u> times until connected to the remote FTP server.

       <b>-b</b>      Run in background (by submitting a batch job and then spawning <u>ncftpbatch</u>).

       <b>-bb</b>     Similar to <b>-b</b> option, but only submits the batch job.  You will need to run  <u>ncftpbatch</u>  for  the
               batch  job  to be processed.  This is useful if you already have a <u>ncftpbatch</u> process running, or
               wish to have better control of when batch jobs are processed.

               For example, if you wanted to do background processing of three files  all  on  the  same  remote
               server,  it  is  more  polite  to  use  just  one  <u>ncftpbatch</u>  process  to process the three jobs
               sequentially, rather than having three <u>ncftpbatch</u> processes open three simultaneous FTP  sessions
               to the same server.

       <b>-B</b> <u>XX</u>   Try setting the TCP/IP socket buffer size to <u>XX</u> bytes.

       <b>-W</b> <u>XX</u>   Send raw FTP command <u>XX</u> after logging in.

       <b>-X</b> <u>XX</u>   Send raw FTP command <u>XX</u> after each file transferred.

       <b>-Y</b> <u>XX</u>   Send raw FTP command <u>XX</u> before logging out.

               The  <b>-W</b>,  <b>-X</b>,  and  <b>-Y</b>  options  are useful for advanced users who need to tweak behavior on some
               servers.  For example, users accessing mainframes might need to send some special  SITE  commands
               to set blocksize and record format information.

               For  these  options,  you can use them multiple times each if you need to send multiple commands.
               For the <b>-X</b> option, you can use the cookie <b>%s</b> to expand  into  the  name  of  the  file  that  was
               transferred.

       <b>-o</b> <u>XX</u>   Set advanced option <u>XX</u>.

               This  option  is  used  primarily for debugging.  It sets the value of an internal variable to an
               integer value.  An example usage would be: <b>-o</b> <u>useFEAT=0,useCLNT=1</u> which in  this  case,  disables
               use  of the FEAT command and enables the CLNT command.  The available variables include: usePASV,
               useSIZE,  useMDTM,  useREST,  useNLST_a,   useNLST_d,   useFEAT,   useMLSD,   useMLST,   useCLNT,
               useHELP_SITE,      useSITE_UTIME,      STATfileParamWorks,     NLSTfileParamWorks,     require20,
               allowProxyForPORT, doNotGetStartCWD.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The purpose of <u>ncftpget</u> is to do file transfers from the command-line  without  entering  an  interactive
       shell.   This  lets  you  write  shell scripts or other unattended processes that can do FTP.  It is also
       useful for advanced users who want to retrieve files from the shell  command  line  without  entering  an
       interactive FTP program such as <u>ncftp</u>.

       One particularly useful feature of this program is that you can give it a <u>uniform</u> <u>resource</u> <u>locator</u> as the
       only argument and the program will download that file.  You can then copy and paste from your web browser
       or newsreader and use that URL.  Example:

           $ cd <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>
           $ ncftpget <a href="ftp://ftp.ncftp.com/pub/ncftp/ncftp.tar.Z">ftp://ftp.ncftp.com/pub/ncftp/ncftp.tar.Z</a>
           $ zcat ncftp.tar.Z | tar xf -

       By  default  the  program  tries  to  open  the  remote host and login anonymously, but you can specify a
       username and password information.  The <b>-u</b> option is used to specify the username to login as, and the <b>-p</b>
       option is used to specify the password.  If you are running the program from the shell, you may omit  the
       <b>-p</b> option and the program will prompt you for the password.

       Using  the  <b>-u</b>  and <b>-p</b> options are not recommended, because your account information is exposed to anyone
       who can see your shell script or your process information.  For example, someone  using  the  <u>ps</u>  program
       could see your password while the program runs.

       You may use the <b>-f</b> option instead to specify a file with the account information.  However, this is still
       not  secure  because  anyone who has read access to the information file can see the account information.
       Nevertheless, if you choose to use the <b>-f</b> option the file should look something like this:

           host sphygmomanometer.ncftp.com
           user gleason
           pass mypasswd

       Don't forget to change the permissions on this file so no one else can read them.

       The <b>-d</b> option is very useful when you are trying to diagnose why a file transfer is failing.   It  prints
       out  the  entire FTP conversation to the file you specify, so you can get an idea of what went wrong.  If
       you specify the special name <u>stdout</u> as the name of the debugging output file,  the  output  will  instead
       print to the screen.  Example:

           $ ncftpget -d stdout bowser.nintendo.co.jp . /pub/README
           220: FTP server ready.
           Connected to bowser.nintendo.co.jp.
           Cmd: USER anonymous
           331: Guest login ok, send your complete e-mail address as password.
           Cmd: PASS xxxxxxxx
           230: Welcome!
           Logged in to bowser.nintendo.co.jp as anonymous.
           Cmd: TYPE I
           200: Type set to I.
           Cmd: PORT 192,168,9,37,6,76
           200: PORT command successful.
           Cmd: RETR /pub/README
           550: /pub/README: File in use.
           Cmd: QUIT
           221: Goodbye.

       Using  ASCII mode is helpful when the text format of your host differs from that of the remote host.  For
       example, if you are retrieving a .TXT file from a Windows-based host to a UNIX system, you could use  the
       <b>-a</b>  flag  which would use ASCII transfer mode so that the file created on the UNIX system would be in the
       UNIX text format instead of the MS-DOS text format.

       You can retrieve an entire directory tree of files by using the <b>-R</b> flag.  However, this will work only if
       the remote FTP server is a UNIX server, or emulates UNIX's list output.  Example:

           $ ncftpget -R ftp.ncftp.com <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> /pub/ncftp

       This would create a /tmp/ncftp hierarchy.
