</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ips - intelligent process status

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ips</b> <b>[column-options]</b> <b>[select-options]</b> <b>[sort-options]</b> <b>[other-options]</b> <b>[macro-names]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Ips</b>  is  an  intelligent  ps-like program which displays process or thread status obtained from the <u><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></u>
       filesystem.  It has features to make tracking of active, semi-active, and transient processes  easy.   It
       is extremely configurable, but is still efficient.  <b>Ips</b> tries to consume as little runtime as possible by
       only collecting as much information as is needed for the particular display specified.

       <b>Ips</b>  normally  displays the process status once and then exits, but it can also act like a <u>top</u> program to
       display process status repeatedly.  The output can be displayed line by line  as  for  a  dumb  terminal,
       displayed  through  the  <u>curses</u>  library  using cursor addressing, or displayed in a raw X11 window.  The
       output can be colored to highlight rows of interest.

       The information to be displayed about processes can be selected on a column-by-column basis.  Each column
       displayes one piece of information about the processes.  The set of columns to  be  displayed  and  their
       order may be changed.

       Processes  can  be  selected  for  displaying based on the values of one or more columns.  Some selection
       criteria are pre-defined for efficiency and convenience, such as the process id  and  user  name.   Other
       selection  criteria can be defined using general expressions which refer to any combination of the column
       values.

       The order that processes are displayed is based on sorting the values of one or more columns.  The set of
       columns to sort by, the order of the columns for sorting, and whether each sorting is normal or  reversed
       can be changed.  Arbitrary expressions based on the values of the columns can also be used for sorting.

       Process lines can be colored based on arbitrary expressions so as to highlight the processes of interest.
       The  foreground color, background color, underlining, and boldness can be set for the output.  The header
       lines can also be colored.

       <b>Ips</b> reads initilization files to define macros which make it  easy  to  specify  useful  combinations  of
       configuration  options.   Therefore  many  different  output  formats  and  short-cuts  to  common option
       combinations can be used.

       Options to <b>ips</b> are minus signs followed by short words or phrases.  Multiple options cannot  be  combined
       together  following one minus sign (unlike the case with many other utilities).  Options are processed in
       the order that they are given  on  the  command  line.   Combinations  of  options  which  appear  to  do
       conflicting  actions  are permitted.  This is because each option merely modifies the state left from the
       previous options.  The state left after all the options have been processed is the one which is  actually
       executed.

</pre><h4><b>SPECIFYING</b> <b>COLUMNS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  many columns of information which can be selected for display.  Each column displays one item
       of information about the displayed processes.  The set of columns and their order can be specified by the
       user.

       Each column has a defined width, which is usually adequate to hold the widest possible data item for that
       column.  This width is just a default and can be changed if desired.   The  data  items  shown  within  a
       column  are left justified, right justified, or centered within the column width according to the type of
       column.  In some cases the column width might not be adequate to show the complete data item, and in this
       case the item is truncated to the column width.  Truncation is indicated by a vertical bar at  the  right
       edge of the column.  (The usual columns which require truncation are the <u>command</u> and <u>environment</u> columns,
       which displays the full command line or environment string for a process.)

       The  <u>ips</u> program enforces a limit on the total width used for displaying of columns.  If too many columns
       are selected for display, then one or more columns from the right are removed until the remaining columns
       fit within the total width.  The width limit is usually implicitly set by the terminal or window's width.
       But if desired, the width limit can be explicitly specified by the user.  (This is convenient if the  <u>ips</u>
       program's output is being piped to another process, for example.)

       If  the  final displayed column does not extend out to the total width limit, then that column's width is
       extended to include the remaining columns.  This allows more of the  data  item  to  be  seen  before  it
       requires  truncation.   (Typically, the <u>command</u> column is the rightmost column so as to take advantage of
       these extra columns.)

       The options for manipulating columns are <u>-col</u>, <u>-addcol</u>, <u>-remcol</u>,  <u>-sep</u>,  <u>-width</u>,  <u>-colwidth</u>,  <u>-vert</u>,  and
       <u>-listcolumns</u>.

       The <u>-col</u> option first clears any existing list of column names for display, and then sets the new list of
       column  names  to  be  displayed  as  specified.  The columns are displayed in the order specified in the
       option.  If there is a duplicate column name in the list, then only the last use of the  column  name  is
       effective.

       The  <u>-addcol</u> option adds the specified columns to the existing list of column names to be displayed.  The
       new columns are added in the order specified, and by  default  are  appended  after  previously  existing
       columns  in the list.  If any of the column names are already in the existing list, then they are removed
       from the list before being added back into it.  An argument can be a number,  in  which  case  any  later
       column  names  are  inserted  into the list starting at the specified column number.  Out of range column
       numbers are silently changed to the nearest legal  value.   For  example,  <b>ips</b>  <b>-addcol</b>  <b>2</b>  <b>uid</b>  <b>gid</b>  <b>999</b>
       <b>percentcpu</b>  adds  the  user  id  column  as  column  2,  the group id column as column 3, and appends the
       percentage cpu column after all other columns.

       The <u>-remcol</u> option removes the specified columns from the list of column names, without caring whether or
       not the columns were in the list.

       The <u>-sep</u> option specifies the separation between adjacent columns in the display.  It has  one  argument,
       which  is  the  number  of  spaces  to  insert between each pair of columns.  The default separation is 2
       spaces.

       The <u>-width</u> option specifies the total width available for the display of columns.  It has  one  argument,
       which  is the number of columns available.  If this option is not given and the output is to <b>stdout</b>, then
       the width is obtained from the kernel if <b>stdout</b> is a terminal, or else is set to 80 columns if <b>stdout</b>  is
       not a terminal.

       The <u>-colwidth</u> option specifies the width of a particular column.  It has one or two arguments.  The first
       argument is the name of the column whose width is to be set.  The second argument is the desired width of
       the column.  If the second argument is not given, then the column width is set to its default value.

       The  <u>-vert</u>  option  changes  the  output  format from the default horizontal one into a vertical one.  In
       vertical format, the status for each process is multi-line where each displayed  value  uses  a  complete
       line.  The beginning of each line contains the column heading and a colon character, unless the <u>-noheader</u>
       option  was  used.  Each value is left justified to the same position on the line and can use the rest of
       the available output width.  The <u>-sep</u> option sets the number of spaces between the widest  column  header
       and  the beginning of the values.  If multiple processes are being displayed, then a blank line separates
       their status lines.

       The <u>-listcolumns</u> option simply lists the names of the available columns and then exits.  The heading  for
       the column and the default width of the column is also shown.

</pre><h4><b>SELECTION</b> <b>OF</b> <b>PROCESSES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>DISPLAY</b></h4><pre>
       The  set  of  processes  to  be  shown  can  be  specified by a number of options.  Each of these options
       specifies a condition to be met.   Processes  will  only  be  shown  which  meet  all  of  the  specified
       conditions.

       The  options  which specify conditions to be met are <u>-pid</u>, <u>-user</u>, <u>-group</u>, <u>-my</u>, <u>-noroot</u>, <u>-noself</u>, <u>-active</u>,
       <u>-top</u>, and <u>-cond</u>.

       The <u>-pid</u> option is followed by one or more process ids, and restricts the display to only  the  specified
       processes if they exist.  Using this option multiple times adds to the list of process ids to be shown.

       The  <u>-user</u>  option  is  followed  by  one  or  more  user names or user ids, and restricts the display to
       processes with those user ids if they exist.  Using this option multiple times adds to the list of  users
       to be shown.

       The  <u>-group</u>  option  is  followed  by  one or more group names or group ids, and restricts the display to
       processes with those group ids if they exist.  Using this option multiple  times  adds  to  the  list  of
       groups to be shown.

       The  <u>-program</u>  option  is  followed  by one or more program names, and restricts the display to processes
       having those program names if they exist.  A program name is  the  name  of  the  executable  file  which
       started  the  process (as displayed in the <u>program</u> column).  This is not always the same name as shown in
       the command line arguments.  Using this option multiple times adds to the list of programs to be shown.

       The <u>-my</u> option only selects process which have my user id.

       The <u>-noroot</u> option disables selection of processes which run as root.

       The <u>-noself</u> option removes the <b>ips</b> process from the display.

       The <u>-active</u> option only shows processes which are either running or which have run recently.

       The <u>-top</u> option limits the display to a specified number of processes.  After  displaying  the  specified
       number of processes, further ones are ignored.  If no argument is given to the option, then the height of
       the terminal or window is used to limit the number of displayed processes.

       The previous options can only select processes which match a small set of possible conditions.  The <u>-cond</u>
       option  is  different,  and understands general expressions.  The expression is specified in the argument
       following the option.  (The argument usually needs quoting to avoid being split into  multiple  arguments
       or having its tokens interpreted by the shell.)

       You  can  select  processes  matching  a  condition which is any combination of the column values for the
       process.  This is done by specifying an expression to be evaluated for each process.  If  the  result  of
       the  expression  is  non-zero  or  non-null,  then  the process is selected.  If the expression cannot be
       evaluated (such as an attempt to divide by zero), then no error is generated but the process will not  be
       selected.

       Most  of  the  expression  syntax  from  C  can  be  applied  to  the  column values, such as arithmetic,
       comparisons, logical ANDs and ORs, the use of parentheses, the question mark operator, and some  built-in
       functions.   Numeric  and  string constants can be used within expressions.  Numbers are usually decimal,
       but are octal if started with a leading 0, and hex if started with a leading 0x.  Strings are enclosed in
       a pair of matching single or double quotes.  Generally,  string  values  must  be  compared  with  string
       values,  and  numeric  values  compared  with  numeric  values.   But in some cases numeric values can be
       converted to strings for comparison.

       Column values are represented in the expressions by their column names  as  listed  by  the  <u>-listcolumns</u>
       option,  where  unique  abbreviations  are allowed.  Values from multiple columns can be used in the same
       expression, and can be compared against each other.  Some column values are numeric, whereas other column
       values are strings.

       The value obtained from using a column name is usually its <u>base</u> value, which is the unformatted primitive
       unit of information for the column.  For example, for runtimes, this is the number of <u>jiffies</u> of  runtime
       the  process  has  used  (i.e., 100's of seconds).  A base value can be either a numeric or string value,
       depending on the column.

       You can apply qualifiers to the column names to use alternate  representations  of  a  column  value.   A
       qualifier  is  a  word  following  the  column  name which is separated from it by a period.  The allowed
       qualifiers are <u>base</u>, <u>show</u>, and <u>test</u>.

       Using the <u>base</u> qualifier is the same thing as using the column name by itself (the base value).

       Using the <u>show</u> qualifier returns the column value as a string value which is the same as is displayed for
       the column.  So for example, for runtimes the <u>show</u> value contains colons and  periods  separating  hours,
       minutes, and parts of seconds.

       Using  the  <u>test</u>  qualifier  returns a boolean value (1 for TRUE and 0 for FALSE) indicating whether some
       useful aspect of the column is true.  The meaning of this test  varies  depending  on  the  column.   For
       example,  for the column showing the parent pid, the test returns whether or not the process has a parent
       (i.e., not 0 or 1).

       There are several functions that can be used within expressions.  These are <u>min</u>, <u>max</u>, <u>abs</u>, <u>strlen</u>, <u>match</u>,
       <u>cmp</u>, <u>str</u>, and <u>my</u>.

       The <u>min</u>, <u>max</u>, and <u>abs</u> functions take numeric arguments, and take the minimum of two numbers, the  maximum
       of two numbers, or the absolute value of a number.

       The  <u>strlen</u>  function  returns length of the string argument, or if a number was given, the length of the
       string representation of that number.

       The <u>cmp</u> function compares two arguments and returns -1, 0, or 1 according to whether the  first  argument
       is  less  than,  equal  to, or greater than the second argument.  If both arguments are numeric, then the
       comparison is done on their values.  Otherwise, the comparison is done as a string, converting a  numeric
       argument to a string value if required.

       The  <u>match</u>  function  takes  two  arguments  which  may  be string or numeric values.  Numeric values are
       converted into the corresponding string value.  The first argument is a string value to be  tested.   The
       second  argument  is a wildcard pattern to match against.  The wildcard syntax is like filename matching,
       so '?' means any single character, '*'  means  any  sequence  of  characters,  and  '[]'  matches  single
       occurances  of  the  enclosed characters.  The function returns 1 if the string matches, and 0 if it does
       not.

       The <u>-str</u> function converts its argument to a string value.

       The <u>my</u> function takes one argument, which is a column name (possibly qualified).  It returns the value of
       that column for the <b>ips</b> process <u>itself</u>.  For example, <u>my(ttyname)</u> returns a string which is  my  terminal
       name.   In order to be of maximum use, the <u>uid</u>, <u>user</u>, <u>gid</u>, and <u>group</u> columns return the user's real group
       and user ids for the <u>my</u> function, even if the <b>ips</b> program has been made setuid.

       Upper case names can be used within  expressions,  which  are  macro  names  to  be  expanded  into  sub-
       expressions.  These macro names are defined in the initialization files.  The expansion of the macro must
       be  a  complete  expression  on its own, with proper use of parenthesis and operators.  The macro name is
       replaced with the result of evaluating the sub-expression, and so can be  a  number  or  a  string.   The
       definition of a sub-expression can also contain macro names which will also be evaluated.

</pre><h4><b>SORTING</b> <b>OF</b> <b>DISPLAYED</b> <b>PROCESSES</b></h4><pre>
       The  default  sorting  order  of  displayed  processes is by their process id.  But the list of displayed
       processes can be sorted based on any combination of the column values.  The columns to be  sorted  by  do
       not have to be restricted to the set of columns which are being displayed.

       The first specified sorting column is used to sort the processes.  If two or more processes have the same
       value  for  the  first  sorting  column,  then they are sorted by the second specified sorting column (if
       specified).  This process continues as long as there are sorting  columns  specified  and  any  processes
       still  need  sorting.  If any processes are still left with matching sorting values after all the sorting
       columns have been used, then the process ids are used for a final sort.

       Sorting on a column can be either a normal sort, or a reverse sort.  In a  normal  sort,  processes  with
       smaller  values  will  be  displayed  first.   In  a  reverse  sort, processes with larger values will be
       displayed first.  Values are compared based on the type of column used for sorting.   Some  columns  sort
       based  on integer values, and some sort based on string values.  Even if the displayed value is a string,
       the sorting may be based on the underlying integral <u>base</u> value.  (The <u>start-time</u> column is an example.)

       The <u>-sort</u>, <u>-revsort</u>, <u>-sortexpr</u>, <u>-revsortexpr</u>, and <u>-nosort</u> options are used to specify sorting values.

       The <u>-sort</u> and <u>-revsort</u> options are used to append columns to the sorting list, either for normal  sorting
       or for reverse sorting.  They are followed by the list of columns to be added for sorting.

       The  <u>-sortexpr</u>  and  <u>-revsortexpr</u>  options append an arbitrary expression to the sorting list, either for
       normal sorting or for reverse sorting.  The expression can be made up of column names, numbers,  strings,
       and  operators,  as  in the <u>-cond</u> option.  Sorting is done on the result of the expression which may be a
       numeric or string value.

       The <u>-nosort</u> removes all columns from the sorting list, leaving only the default sort based on process id.

</pre><h4><b>COLORING</b> <b>OF</b> <b>THE</b> <b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       By default, all of the output text from <b>ips</b> is shown in the normal foreground and  background  colors  of
       the output method (e.g., black on white for X11 output).

       The  information  line,  the  header line, and the process rows can be individually colored by specifying
       foreground colors, background colors, and attributes for them.

       The specification of a color is most generally given by  string  consisting  of  three  parts  which  are
       separated  by  slash characters.  These three parts are a foreground color name, a background color name,
       and attribute letters.

       If only one slash is present then only  a  foreground  and  background  color  name  is  given,  with  no
       attributes.  If no slash is present then only a foreground color name is given with no background name or
       attributes.

       If  a  color  name is empty or has the special value <u>default</u>, then that color is the default color of the
       output method.

       The attribute letters can be either <b>'</b><u>b</u><b>'</b> to indicate bold (or bright)  text,  or  else  <b>'</b><u>u</u><b>'</b>  to  indicated
       underlined text, or else both.

       Examples of color specifications are: <b>red</b>, <b>/blue</b>, <b>green/yellow</b>, <b>default/default</b>, <b>//u</b>, and <b>red//bu</b>.  These
       set  a  foreground  of  red  with  a  default  background, a default foreground with a blue background, a
       foreground of green with a yellow background, a default foreground and background, a  default  foreground
       and  background  with  the  text underlined, and a red foreground with a default background with the text
       underlined and made bold.

       The available colors depends on the output method, as well as the naming convention of the colors.

       For X11 output, many colors are available and can be named explicitly or else  specified  using  3  or  6
       hexadecimal digits following a hash mark to give the red, green, and blue components.

       For  curses  and  terminal  output,  up  to  256 colors can be used (according to the capabilities of the
       terminal).  The colors are numeric values from 0 to 255, with the first 8 being the primary  colors,  the
       next 8 being the secondary colors, the last 20 or so being gray scale colors, and the others an arbitrary
       color.  Alternatively, the names of the eight primary colors can be used.

       The  information  line  can be colored using the <u>-infocolor</u> option.  The header line can be colored using
       the <u>-headercolor</u> option.

       The process rows being output can be colored using one or more uses of the <u>-rowcolor</u> option.  This option
       takes two arguments.  The first argument is a color specification.  The second argument is an  expression
       to be evaluated for the process being shown in the row, as in the <u>-cond</u> option.  If the condition is true
       then the row will be colored in the specified color.

       If  multiple  <u>-rowcolor</u>  options are used and multiple conditions match a row, then the color of the last
       matching condition is used for the row.

       Rows which are not matched by the  conditions  in  any  <u>-rowcolor</u>  option  are  colored  in  the  default
       foreground and background colors.

</pre><h4><b>SPECIFYING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>DISPLAY</b> <b>METHOD</b></h4><pre>
       The  output from <u>ips</u> can be displayed using one of several different methods.  The <u>-once</u>, <u>-loop</u>, <u>-curses</u>,
       and <u>-x11</u> options are used to specify which of the display methods are used.  The default option is <u>-once</u>.

       Both of the <u>-once</u> and <u>-loop</u> options specifies a display method which writes the process status to  <b>stdout</b>
       line  by  line  using no cursor addressing sequences.  Such output is suitable for saving to a file using
       redirection of standard output or for processing in a pipeline.  The difference between the  two  options
       indicates  whether or not the output is a once-only snapshot or is to be repeated indefinitely in a loop.
       There is no limit to the number of lines that can be written.  The <u>-clear</u> option can be used with  either
       of  these  options  to  write  the  standard ANSI clear screen escape sequence before each display of the
       process status.

       The <u>-curses</u> option specifies a display method which uses the <u><a href="../man3/curses.3.html">curses</a></u>(3) library for efficient updating  of
       the  screen  using cursor addressing sequences.  This display uses the whole terminal screen.  The screen
       can be resized if desired.  The number of lines of information is limited by the size of  the  screen  so
       that  only  a  subset  of  the status might be visible at one time.  However, the display can be scrolled
       automatically or manually so that eventually all of the status can  be  seen.   The  <u>ips</u>  program  is  in
       looping mode for this display method.  The program can be terminated by typing the <b>q</b> or <b>ESCAPE</b> characters
       into the terminal.

       The  <u>-x11</u>  option  specifies a display method which uses a raw X11 window (i.e., without using a terminal
       emulator such as <u>xterm</u>).  The window can be resized if desired.  The number of lines  of  information  is
       limited  by  the number of rows in the window so that only a subset of the status might be visible at one
       time.  However, the display can be scrolled automatically or manually  so  that  eventually  all  of  the
       status  can  be  seen.   The  <u>ips</u> program is in looping mode for this display method.  The program can be
       terminated by typing the <b>q</b> or <b>ESCAPE</b> characters into the window or by closing the window using the window
       manager.

       The <u>-display</u>, <u>-geometry</u>, <u>-font</u>, <u>-foreground</u>, and <u>-background</u> options can be used to set the display name,
       window geometry, font name, foreground color, and background color for the X11  window.   If  no  display
       name  is  set  then  the  default one using the <b>DISPLAY</b> environment variable is used.  The default window
       geometry is 150x50.  The default font is the <b>fixed</b> font, which is a mono-space (i.e., fixed-width)  font.
       If  a  different  font is specified then it should also be a mono-space font.  The default foreground and
       background colors are <b>black</b> and <b>white</b>.

       Note: The X11 display mode is optional and must have been compiled into <u>ips</u>  when  it  was  built.   This
       allows  <u>ips</u>  to  be built for systems which have no X11 libraries installed.  If your version of <u>ips</u> does
       not have X11 support, then the use of the <u>-x11</u> option will produce an error message and fail.

       For all of the looping display methods, the <u>-sleep</u> option can be used to set the sleep  time  in  seconds
       between  updates.  (If not given, the default sleep time is 10 seconds.)  The argument to this option can
       be a fixed point value, so that for example, a value of 0.5 specifies a sleep of 1/2 second.

       The <u>-scroll</u> and <u>-overlap</u> options can be used for the curses and X11 display modes.   The  <u>-scroll</u>  option
       sets  the  time interval in seconds for automatic scolling of the display if more processes are displayed
       than will fit.  The default scroll time is 30 seconds.  Note that the scrolling interval does not  affect
       how  often  the  display  is  updated (use <u>-sleep</u> for that).  It just means that when the display is next
       updated, if the required time since the last scrolling  had  elapsed,  then  scrolling  occurs  for  that
       update.   It  might take many update cycles before scrolling allows all of the process status to be seen.
       Scrolling wraps around, so that after the last process has been  seen  in  the  display,  then  the  next
       scrolled  display  will  return  to  the  first  process again.  A scroll time of zero disables automatic
       scrolling completely.

       The <u>-overlap</u> option specifies the number of lines of process status which are duplicated  when  scrolling
       occurs.  The default overlap is one line.

</pre><h4><b>THREAD</b> <b>HANDLING</b></h4><pre>
       Depending  on the options used, the <b>ips</b> program shows either the status of the processes in the system or
       the status of the threads in the system.  Without any options only processes are shown.  In order to show
       thread information, the <u>-showthreads</u> option must be used.

       Some processes only consist of one thread of execution, which is the case for most simple programs  which
       have no use for multi-threading.  For these processes, the showing of processes or threads gives the same
       results and there are no problems in interpreting their status.

       However,  some  processes  contain  more  than  one  thread  of  execution.   Threads share many of their
       attributes with each other, such as their memory and opened files, but have  distinct  program  counters,
       stack  pointers,  runtime, and process state.  The threads of a process all have the same process id, but
       have another id called the thread id (tid) which distinguishes them.  One of the threads  is  called  the
       main thread and has a thread id which is the same as the process id.

       When  <b>ips</b> shows only processes, then the status shown for a process consisting of multiple threads can be
       slightly misleading.  The shared attributes are shown correctly for the process.  However,  some  of  the
       distinct  status  values  are only those of the main thread, while those values for the other threads are
       ignored.  Examples of these values are the program counter and the process state.

       In particular, the process state can give very misleading status of the process.  If the main  thread  is
       sleeping, but another thread is constantly running, the state of the process can be misleadingly reported
       as  'S'.   In  this case, the runtime of the process increases quickly and is shown as active, however it
       never appears to be running.

       The runtime of a process is the sum of all of the runtimes of the individual threads, and so is generally
       meaningful.  Note that in a multi-cpu system where multiple threads can simultaneously run,  the  runtime
       of  a process can appear to increase faster than the clock rate since multiple threads can contribute the
       full elapsed time to the process runtime.

       When <b>ips</b> is showing thread status then all of the above problems are avoided.  Each thread of  a  process
       is  then  shown  with  its correct status.  This includes the program counter, the process state, and the
       runtime.  In this case, threads which are running will show their state as 'R' as  expected.   Also  note
       that  when  threads  are shown, the display of the main thread is only that of that particular thread, so
       that its runtime is no longer the sum of all of the threads.

       Even when only processes are being shown, the state information for the process can  optionally  be  more
       accurate  than  indicated above.  If the <u>-usethreads</u> option is used or if the <u>states</u> column is used, then
       the <b>ips</b> program will examine the states of all of the theads of a process, and select the most  important
       state  among  all  of  the  threads  as  the  state to show for the process as a whole.  For example, the
       priority order of the states starts with the 'R', 'D', and 'S' states so that, for example, if any thread
       is running, then the state of the process is 'R' as expected.

       The <u>states</u> column shows all of the states of the threads of a process using multiple letters and  numeric
       counts.   For example, a value of 'R3DS2' indicates that there are three running threads, one thread in a
       disk I/O wait, and two sleeping threads.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>INPUT</b> <b>WHILE</b> <b>RUNNING</b></h4><pre>
       The curses and X11 display modes allow commands to be typed while they are  running.   Commands  are  not
       visible  as they are typed to the screen or window.  The commands are read character by character so that
       they are executed immediately when complete without requiring a terminating newline.  If the  command  is
       one which affects the display then the current sleep is canceled so that the display can show the result.

       Some commands accept an optional numeric argument which is typed just prior to the command.  This numeric
       argument  can  be a non-negative integer value or a non-negative fixed point number.  Commands which only
       accept an integer value ignore any fractional part.  If a numeric argument is  not  given,  the  commands
       will  use a default value.  If a numeric argument is typed, but you no longer want to use it (as when you
       have made a typing mistake), then the backspace or delete keys will totally remove  any  partially  typed
       numeric argument.  At this point you can type in a new numeric argument (if desired).

       The  <b>s</b>  command sets the sleep time to the number of seconds specified in the preceding numeric argument.
       The command accepts a fixed point value so that sleeps less than one second are possible.  If no argument
       is given then the sleep time is set to the default value of 10 seconds.

       The <b>a</b> command sets the automatic scrolling time to the number  of  seconds  specified  in  the  preceding
       numeric  argument.   If  no  argument is given then the autoscroll time is set to the default value of 30
       seconds.  A value of 0 disables autoscrolling.

       The <b>t</b> and <b>b</b> commands change the display to show the top or the bottom of the process  list.   (These  are
       the first and last pages of the display.)

       The  <b>n</b>  and  <b>p</b> commands change the display to show the next or previous page of the process list.  If the
       next page is past the end of the list then the first page is displayed.  Similarly, if the previous  page
       is before the beginning of the list then the last page is displayed.

       The  <b>o</b>  command  sets  the number of lines of overlap between pages of data to the value specified in the
       preceding numeric argument.  If no argument is given then the overlap value is set to the  default  value
       of 1 line.

       The  <b>i</b>  command  enables  or disables an information line at the top of the display which shows the total
       number of process and threads in the system, the number of threads or processes which are currently being
       shown, the sleep time, the currently displayed page number, and if the display is frozen,  an  indication
       of  that  fact.   Without any arguments, the display of the information line is toggled.  A zero argument
       disables the line.  A nonzero argument enables the line.

       The <b>h</b> command enables or disables the column header  line  at  the  top  of  the  display.   Without  any
       arguments,  the  display  of the header line is toggled.  A zero argument disables the header.  A nonzero
       argument enables the header.

       The <b>'f'</b> command enables or disables the frozen state of the display.  Without any arguments,  the  frozen
       state is toggled.  A nonzero argument freezes the display.  A zero argument unfreezes the display.  While
       the  display  is frozen, the <u>ips</u> program simply waits for further commands (ignoring the normal sleep and
       autoscroll times).  The automatic collection of new process data is  disabled.   Automatic  scrolling  is
       also  disabled.  However, commands can still be typed while the display is frozen to perform scrolling or
       process status updating on demand.

       A <b>SPACE</b> or <b>RETURN</b> character updates the display immediately.  New process data will be collected for  the
       display.  This occurs even if the display is currently frozen.

       The  <b>r</b>  command  refreshes  the contents of the display to fix any glitches.  This is mostly intended for
       curses use when other programs output to the screen, or when the terminal emulator misbehaves.

       A <b>q</b> or <b>ESCAPE</b> character quits <u>ips</u>.

       All other characters are illegal and ring the bell.

</pre><h4><b>INITIALIZATION</b> <b>FILES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>MACROS</b></h4><pre>
       For convenience and to allow users to configure the output to their liking, <u>ips</u> reads two  initialization
       files  on  startup.   The  first  of the files to be read is the system initialization file <u>/etc/ips.init</u>
       which is used to set system defaults for <b>ips</b>.

       The second initialization file to be read is the user initialization file <u>$HOME/.ipsrc</u>  located  in  each
       user's  home  directory.   This  allows  each  user to modify the system defaults for their own use.  The
       reading of the user's initialization file can be disabled by using the <u>-noinit</u>  option.   If  used,  this
       option must be the first option after the command name.

       The  contents  of  the  initialization  files  are very simple.  Each line of the file can be blank, be a
       comment, or be a macro definition.  If any line ends in a backslash, then the backslash is replaced by  a
       space  and the next line is appended to it.  Comment lines have a hash mask character as their first non-
       blank character.  Comment lines and blank lines are ignored.

       The first line of initialization files must consist of the word <b>#ips#</b>, otherwise an error message will be
       generated and the program will exit.

       Macro definitions are used  to  replace  single  arguments  on  the  command  line  with  possibly  large
       replacement  strings  with  many arguments.  The replacement strings can themselves use macros, and these
       new macros are also removed and replaced.  Macro replacement continues until either no more macros remain
       to be replaced, or until the allowed macro depth is exceeded.

       Macro names are usually distinguished from non-macros by the fact  that  macros  begin  with  upper  case
       letters.   Since  column names are all in lower case, there is no problem distinguishing between a column
       name and a macro name.

       There are three different types of macros in <u>ips</u>.  These types are distinguished by the location  of  the
       macro  usage  within the command line.  The three types of macros are commands, columns, and expressions.
       Command macros define a list of command line options and their arguments.  Column macros define a list of
       column names.  Expression macros define a sub-expression  for  the  <u>-cond</u>,  <u>-sortexpr</u>,  and  <u>-revsortexpr</u>
       options.

       Because  the  meaning of these three types of macros differs so much, and the replacement strings for the
       macros would generally make no sense if used for a different type of macro, the  three  types  of  macros
       have independent name spaces.  This means that the same macro name could be defined three times, once for
       each type of macro.  (But this is probably bad practice).

       To  define  a  macro  in  an  initialization  file,  you use one of the keywords <u>option</u>, <u>column</u>, or <u>expr</u>,
       followed by the macro name and the replacement strings for the  macro,  all  on  one  line  (taking  into
       account the use of backslashes to continue lines).  The macro names must begin with an upper case letter.

       The  <u>option</u>  keyword  defines  a macro as being one or more command line options.  The replacement string
       consists of a number of space separated options and arguments as used on the command line, including  the
       leading  hyphens  for  the  options.   Arguments for options must be contained within the macro expansion
       itself.  The macro expansion can itself contain macros which will also be expanded into more options.

       As the single exception to the requirement that macro names are in upper case, if a word appears  on  the
       <b>ips</b>  command  line  which is not an option, and which cannot be an argument for an option, then that word
       with its initial letter converted to upper case is treated as an option macro to be expanded.

       An important special case of this is a word typed immediately  after  the  <b>ips</b>  program  name.   This  is
       typically  a  macro  name which defines a particular format of display.  For example, the command <b>ips</b> <b>top</b>
       would expand the option macro named <b>Top</b> which could be defined to emulate the output of the <b>top</b> program.

       The <u>column</u> keyword defines a macro as being a list of column names.  The replacement string consists of a
       number of space separated column names.  The macro expansion can itself contain macros which will also be
       expanded into more column names.

       The <u>expr</u> keyword defines a macro which is an expression used for the <u>-cond</u>,  <u>-sortexpr</u>,  or  <u>-revsortexpr</u>
       options.   The replacement string consists of a complete expression using numbers, strings, column names,
       and possibly other macros which will also be expanded.

       Here is an example of a valid initialization file:

       #ips#

       # The special command macro run by default
       option    SysInit   -col pid parent user summary runtime command

       # Definitions for other commands of interest

       expr User !Server
       expr Stop (state == 'T')
       expr Mytty     (ttydev == my(ttydev))

       The special option macro names of <b>SysInit</b> and <b>UserInit</b> are automatically expanded (if they  are  defined)
       at  the  start  of  every  run of <b>ips</b>.  These macros are used to initialize parameters to default values.
       Examples of this initialization is to specify the default list of columns to be displayed and the default
       sleep time when looping.  The <b>SysInit</b> macro definition is usually contained in the system  initialization
       file,  while  the  <b>UserInit</b>  macro  definition  is  usually  contained in the user's initialization file.
       Parameters set by these macros can be modified by using options on the command line.

</pre><h4><b>USEFUL</b> <b>MACROS</b></h4><pre>
       The standard supplied system initialization file <u>/etc/ips.init</u> contains many macros  of  interest.   This
       section describes some of the standard macros which are provided.  Remember that these macros can be used
       in lower case on the command line.

       Warning:  These macros might not actually work on your system as described here since they can be changed
       by the system administrator.  The system administrator may also have added other useful macros which  are
       not described here.  You should examine the macro definitions in the initialization file in order to make
       full use of <b>ips</b>.

       The  default  macro  <u>SysInit</u>  adds a condition to only show your own processes.  So in order to see other
       user's processes, you must disable that condition explicitly or else use a macro which disables it.   The
       <u>Nocond</u> macro removes all conditions on the selection of processes allowing you to see all processes.

       The  user  name  column is not shown by default.  The <u>Long</u> macro changes the displayed columns to include
       the user name and the parent pid.

       The <u>All</u> macro combines the <u>Nocond</u> and <u>Long</u> macros to show all processes in a nice display.

       The <u>Pack</u> macro shows many useful columns together including the user and group ids, the state  of  stdio,
       and the process age.

       The  <u>Cmd</u>  and <u>Env</u> macros show only the process id and the command line or environment so that you can see
       much more of these columns than is usual.

       The <u>Files</u> macro shows columns related to files, such as the number of open files, the  status  of  stdio,
       and the current and root directories.

       The  <u>Cpu</u>  macro shows a snapshot display of the currently active processes.  It has a two second sleep in
       order to detect running processes.  The <u>Top</u> macro shows the same display format, but in a looping  manner
       using <u>curses</u> and including recently active processes.

       The  width  of  the  runtime  columns  is  not adequate to hold really large runtimes.  The <u>Widerun</u> macro
       increases the width of these columns to show larger runtimes.

       The <u>Wide</u> macro makes the output width be as large as possible, allowing the showing of very long  command
       lines or environments.

       The <u>Vert</u> macro sets the output format to vertical and shows every column value.

       The <u>Tty</u> macro adds a condition to only show processes which are on a terminal.

       The <u>Mytty</u> macro adds a condition to only show processes which are on your own terminal.

       The <u>Stop</u> macro adds a condition to show stopped processes.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       There are several other features of <b>ips</b> which can be specified using command line options.  These options
       are   <u>-default</u>,   <u>-read</u>,   <u>-initsleep</u>,   <u>-noheader</u>,   <u>-activetime</u>,  <u>-deathtime</u>,  <u>-synctime</u>,  <u>-listmacros</u>,
       <u>-listcolumns</u>, <u>-version</u>, <u>-end</u>, and <u>-help</u>.

       The <u>-default</u> option is useful to reset parameters that have been set by previous options.  In particular,
       it is useful to reset parameters that have been set by the initialization files.  It accepts one or  more
       option names (without the leading hyphens).  Any parameter set by the indicated option is restored to its
       initial  state  as  when  the  <b>ips</b>  program  started.   For  example,  <b>-default</b>  <b>pid</b> removes any previous
       restriction on the process ids that can be shown.

       The output from the <u>-help</u> option will briefly describe the use of the remaining options.

</pre><h4><b>COLUMN</b> <b>DESCRIPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Some of the columns for displaying are self-evident.  But many of them need an explanation, and  this  is
       done  here.   Due  to  the permissions on <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a>, some of the column values may not be available for every
       process.  Columns marked as <b>restricted</b> are only available if the process has your own user  id,  you  are
       running as root, or the <b>ips</b> program itself is setuid to root.

       The <u>state</u> column shows the current state of the process.  This is a single letter, where 'R' is runnable,
       'D' is disk I/O, 'T' is stopped, 'S' is sleeping, 'Z' is zombie, and ' ' is dead (nonexistent).

       The  <u>eip</u>  and <u>esp</u> columns show the instruction pointer and stack pointer of the process.  The instruction
       pointer is also known as the program counter, or PC.

       The <u>waitchannel</u> column shows the hex address within the kernel that the process is sleeping on.  This  is
       zero if the process is not sleeping.  Usually, different reasons for sleeping use different addresses.

       The <u>waitsymbol</u> column shows the symbolic address within the kernel that the process is sleeping on.  This
       is blank if the process is not sleeping.

       The  <u>program</u> and <u>command</u> columns show the program name and command line of the process.  The program name
       is just the name of the executable file without any arguments.  The command line shows the arguments that
       the program was started with.  If no command line arguments were  supplied  to  the  program,  then  this
       column shows the program name enclosed in parenthesis.

       The  <u>idletime</u>  column shows the number of minutes that the process has been idle.  An idle process is one
       which has not (detectably) run at all in the  indicated  interval.   The  idle  time  is  only  known  by
       examining processes over time, and so the true idle time of a process which existed before <b>ips</b> was run is
       not known.  In these cases, the idle time is simply the amount of time that <b>ips</b> has been running, and the
       times are marked with a leading plus sign.

       The  <u>active</u> column shows whether or not the process has been active.  It shows one of the values "active"
       or "idle".  This column is provided mainly for use in sorting and selecting.

       The <u>ttyname</u> and <u>ttydevice</u> columns show the controlling terminal of the  process,  which  is  usually  the
       terminal  where  the  user  logged  into.   The device is the kernel's id for the terminal, and is just a
       number.  The name is found by searching <a href="file:/dev">/dev</a> for a character device which  has  that  same  id  and  then
       displaying the device name with the <a href="file:/dev">/dev</a> removed.

       The  <u>user</u>, <u>uid</u>, <u>group</u>, and <u>gid</u> columns show the user ids and group ids of a process.  The uid and gid are
       the numeric ids as used by the kernel.  The user and group are the conversion of those ids to user  names
       and group names, as found in the <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a> and <a href="file:/etc/group">/etc/group</a> files.

       The <u>percentcpu</u> column shows the percentage of CPU time that the process has used in a certain recent time
       interval  called  the  sample  interval.   The samples are taken at a maximum rate of five times a second
       according to the current sleep time of the <b>ips</b> program.  The sample interval is a sliding value so as  to
       give  an  average  cpu percentage over a specified number of seconds.  This makes the values less 'jumpy'
       than instantaneous cpu percentages would give and act more like the system  load  averages.   The  sample
       interval  is  set  using  the  <u>-percentseconds</u>  option, which can have a value from 0 to 20.  The default
       sample interval is 10 seconds.  The percentage runtime is 100 times the  quotient  of  the  runtime  used
       during  the  sample  interval by the sample interval itself.  Note that for a multi-threaded process on a
       multi-cpu system, the percentage runtime can reach multiples of 100.

       The <u>residentsetsize</u> column is the number of K of memory used by the process.  Pages of  a  process  which
       are not in memory are not counted by this column.

       The <u>starttime</u> and <u>age</u> columns show the time at which the process was created.  The start time is the time
       of day the process started, and if the process was in existence for over one day, then the number of days
       previously  that the process was started.  The age is the number of minutes that the process has existed,
       and is the difference between the current time and the time that the process started.

       The <u>flags</u> column shows some kernel flags associated with the process, in hex.

       The <u>minorpagefaults</u>, <u>majorpagefaults</u>, and <u>pagefaults</u> columns show the number of minor page faults,  major
       page faults, and the total page faults of the process.  Minor page faults are faults on pages that do not
       require  any  disk  I/O,  which  are copy on write or touching empty pages.  Major page faults are faults
       which require disk I/O, such as reading in of text file pages or swap pages.

       The <u>signalcatch</u>, <u>signalignore</u>, and <u>signalblock</u> columns show the state of signal handling for the process.
       Each of these value is a hex value, where signal N is bit number N-1 (counting from bit 0 at the  right).
       Caught  signals  are  those for which a signal handler is installed.  Ignored signals are those for which
       the process is ignoring signals.  Blocked signals are those which are pending  delivery,  but  which  the
       process has blocked from being delivered.

       The <u>openfiles</u> column displays the number of open files that the process has.  This column is restricted.

       The  <u>runorder</u>  column  shows  the  relative run order of the processes.  The run order is a monotonically
       increasing value representing the number of process  samplings  that  <b>ips</b>  has  made  since  it  started.
       Processes  are  assigned the current run order value whenever they are seen to have been active since the
       last sample.  Processes with a larger run order value have run more recently.

       The <u>currentdirectory</u> column gives the current working directory of the process in the  kernel's  internal
       values  of  device  number  and inode number, separated by a colon.  The device number is in hex, and the
       inode number is in decimal.  This column is restricted.

       The <u>rootdirectory</u> column gives the root directory of the process  in  the  kernel's  internal  values  of
       device  number and inode number, separated by a colon.  The device number is in hex, and the inode number
       is in decimal.  This column is restricted.

       The <u>executable</u> column gives the device number and inode number of the executable file  for  the  process,
       separated  by  a colon.  The device number is in hex, and the inode number is in decimal.  This column is
       restricted.

       The <u>realtimer</u> column shows the amount of time that the process wants to  sleep  before  being  woken  up.
       This  is  either just the number of seconds, or else is the number of seconds and parts of seconds.  This
       value does not decrement as time passes, so you don't know when the sleep time will expire.

       The <u>stdin</u>, <u>stdout</u>, and <u>stderr</u> columns show the file names associated with the stdin,  stdout,  or  stderr
       file descriptors of the process.  These columns are restricted.

       The  <u>stdio</u>  column  shows  a  summary  of  the  files  associated  with the stdin, stdout, or stderr file
       descriptors of the process.  This is in the form of a three character string with one character for  each
       of  the <b>stdin</b>, <b>stdout</b>, and <b>stderr</b> file descriptors.  The character is 'T' for a terminal, 'P' for a pipe,
       'S' for a socket, 'N' for /dev/null, 'F' for some other file, and '-' for a closed file descriptor (or if
       the information is unavailable).  This column is restricted.

       The <u>summary</u> column shows many flag characters which summarize some of the state  of  the  process.   This
       consists  of  a  string  of  14  characters, where each character is either a dash or a letter.  A letter
       indicates the specified condition is true for that character position, whereas a dash indicates that  the
       condition is false for that character position.

       Character  1  is  the  state  of  the process, except that if the process is sleeping, then it is 'A' for
       recently active, or 'I' for idle, and if the process has died (i.e., no longer existent), then it is '-'.
       Character 2 is 'W' if the process has no resident memory, and is therefore swapped out.  Character  3  is
       'N'  if  the  process  has  been  niced, and is 'H' if the process has been given as higher priority than
       normal.  Character 4 is 'S' if the process is a session id leader.  Character 5 is 'P' if the process  is
       a  process  group  leader.  Character 6 is 'T' if the process has a controlling terminal.  Character 7 is
       'F' if the process is a foreground process, which means that its process group  matches  its  controlling
       terminal's  process group.  Character 8 is 'I' if the process has no parent, meaning it is owned by <b>init</b>.
       Character 9 is 'h' if the process is catching SIGHUP or 'H' if the process is ignoring SIGHUP.  Character
       10 is 't' if the process is catching SIGTERM or 'T' if the process is ignoring SIGTERM.  Character 11  is
       'U' if the process has your user id.  Character 12 is 'G' if the process has your group id.  Character 13
       is  'R'  if  the process is running as root.  Character 14 shows the age of the process.  It is 'N' for a
       new process, 'M' for a process one minute old, 'F' for a process five minutes old, 'T' for a process  ten
       minutes  old,  'H'  for  a process one hour old, 'D' for a process one day old, and 'W' for a process one
       week old.

</pre><h4><b>PERFORMANCE</b></h4><pre>
       Some data is only collected if  the  columns  using  that  data  are  used.   Here  'used'  means  either
       displaying,  selecting  on,  or  sorting by the column.  Avoiding columns when they are not required will
       save the time used to collect that data.

       Most process status is obtained by scanning the <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a> directory looking for filenames which  are  numeric
       (which  are  the process ids).  For each of these processes, the file <a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>&lt;pid&gt;/stat must be opened and
       read to collect most of the process status.

       If detailed thread information is requested, then the directories <a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>&lt;pid&gt;/task must  be  scanned  for
       filenames  which  are  numeric  (which  are  the  thread  ids).   For  each  of  these  threads, the file
       <a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>&lt;pid&gt;/task/&lt;tid&gt;/stat must be opened and read to collect the thread status.

       Additional files in <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a> might need to be read to get the full status that is required.

       Using the <u>-pid</u> option will save much work, since then the scan of <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a> is avoided and only the specified
       process ids will be examined.  Using <u>-noself</u> avoids looking at our own process.

       Using the <u>-my</u>, <u>-user</u>, <u>-group</u>, and <u>-noroot</u> options will save time  reading  and  parsing  of  the  process
       status for the eliminated processes, and stop collection of other data for the eliminated processes.

       The  <u>-top</u>  and  <u>-cond</u>  options  may save time by eliminating the display of process information.  But the
       information is still collected.

       The <u>-synctime</u> option changes the interval on which the full process  status  is  collected  for  inactive
       processes.   (See  the  RISKS  section below.)  Setting this to a shorter time interval will increase the
       runtime.

       The <u>command</u> column requires the opening and reading  of  <a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>&lt;pid&gt;/cmdline  whenever  the  process  has
       changed state or when the synctime has expired.

       The  <u>environment</u>  column  requires the opening and reading of <a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>&lt;pid&gt;/environ whenver the process has
       changed state or when the synctime has expired.

       The <u>active</u>, <u>idletime</u>, and <u>percentcpu</u> columns and the <u>-active</u> option require that the <b>ips</b>  program  sample
       the  processes  twice  before  displaying anything, with a small sleep between the two samples.  So there
       will be a delay before seeing anything.

       The <u>ttyname</u> column requires the reading of <a href="file:/dev">/dev</a> to find the list of character devices.  This work adds  a
       delay to the program before anything is displayed.  It is only required once per run.

       The  <u>openfiles</u>  column  requires  the reading of all the files in <a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>&lt;pid&gt;/fd whenever the process has
       changed state or when the synctime has expired.

       The <u>stdin</u>,  <u>stdout</u>,  <u>stderr</u>,  and  <u>stdio</u>  columns  require  the  link  values  of  one  or  more  of  the
       <a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>&lt;pid&gt;/fd/&lt;fd&gt;  files to obtain their information whenever the process has changed state or when the
       synctime has expired.

       The <u>currentdirectory</u> column requires the reading of the <a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>&lt;pid&gt;/cwd file  whenever  the  process  has
       changed state or when the synctime has expired.

       The  <u>rootdirectory</u>  column  requires  the  reading  of the <a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>&lt;pid&gt;<a href="file:/root">/root</a> file whenever the process has
       changed state or when the synctime has expired.

       The <u>waitsymbol</u> column requires the reading of the <a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>&lt;pid&gt;/wchan file whenever the process has changed
       state or when the synctime has expired.

       The <u>executable</u> column requires the reading of the <a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>&lt;pid&gt;/exe file whenever the process  has  changed
       state or when the synctime has expired.

</pre><h4><b>RISKS</b></h4><pre>
       The determination of whether a process has been active since the last sample is not completely foolproof.
       Some of the process data is only collected when a process has been active, or else has not been collected
       for  a  while,  and  so  there  is  a  small  risk  that the data is obsolete.  The columns which are not
       necessarily collected on every update are the ones which require examining <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a>  files  other  than  the
       main  status  file.   These columns include the command line, the environment, the current directory, and
       the number of opened files.

       The <b>ips</b> program checks many process status values to determine whether or not a process has  been  active
       since  the  last  sampling.   If  any of these differ from the last sampling, then the process is active.
       These values are the process state, runtime, flags, page faults, start time, stack  pointer,  instruction
       pointer,  and  wait  channel.  New process are always active, and processes whose state is 'R' or 'D' are
       always active.

       It is possible that a process which wakes up for only a short time, does very little and then  goes  back
       to  sleep will appear to be inactive.  (The kernel only has a 1/100 second runtime resolution, and so the
       small runtime of the process might not have been seen by the kernel.)

       The <u>-synctime</u> option can be used to reduce or expand this risk of showing obsolete data.  It accepts  the
       number  of  seconds  at  which  the complete status of the process is collected even when it is idle.  It
       defaults to one minute.  Setting the synctime to zero produces a status with no obsolete data.

       The list of user names, group names, and device names are only  collected  when  <b>ips</b>  is  first  started.
       Changes to the password file, group files, or device files will not be seen while the program is running.

       The  data  collected  by  <b>ips</b>  is  dynamic.  It can change even while the status is being collected for a
       single process.  So the data shown is only a snapshot and is never absolutely consistent.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITS</b></h4><pre>
       The following are some limits to the operation of <b>ips</b>.  These are compile-time constants,  and  could  be
       increased if required by recompiling the program.

       You can only specify 100 process ids for the <u>-pid</u> option.

       You can only specify 100 user names or ids for the <u>-user</u> option.

       You can only specify 100 group names or ids for the <u>-group</u> option.

       You can only have 1000 arguments on a command line.

       The maximum output width is 31K characters, where K is 1024.

       The maximum command string length is 10K.

       The maximum environment string length is 20K.

       The  maximum  program  name  string  length is 32.  This length is imposed by the kernel which only has a
       buffer of this size.

       The maximum separation between columns is 20 spaces.

       The maximum depth of expansion of option macros is 20.

       The maximum depth of expansion of expression macros is 20.

       The maximum number of seconds for calculating cpu percentages is 20 seconds.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>-clear</u> option clears the screen by outputting the ANSI escape sequence for clearing the  screen.   If
       your terminal does not understand this escape sequence then this option will not work correctly.

       Proportional spaced fonts do not work correctly in the X11 display mode.

       Using  both  of the <u>-vert</u> and <u>-top</u> options together without any argument does nothing useful.  The number
       of processes shown will be dependent on the screen height, but the output will  not  be  limited  to  the
       screen height since each process status prints on multiple lines.

       Pagination of output when using the <u>-vert</u> option is not correct.

       There  are  no  quoting  characters  for  macro  definitions, so you cannot create single arguments which
       contain blanks.  This means that if you use the <u>-cond</u>, <u>-sortexpr</u>, or <u>-revsortexpr</u> options  in  the  macro
       definition  file, then the following expression must not contain any blanks.  However, you <u>can</u> use blanks
       in the definition of an expression macro.

       The specification of a window position for X11 using the <u>-geometry</u> option does not work correctly.

       This program is dependent on the layout of the <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a> file system which changes depending  on  the  kernel
       version.  This particular version of <u>ips</u> works for kernel version 2.6.13.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURES</b></h4><pre>
       I  would  like  to  allow  macros  to  accept arguments enclosed in parenthesis, and have those arguments
       substituted into the replacement string at the locations matching parameter names for the macro.

       I would like to allow user-defined columns where the user can  define  the  format  of  the  data  to  be
       displayed using the results of expressions on other column data.

</pre><h4><b>CREDITS</b></h4><pre>
       Some  of  the  knowledge  on  how  to process and display the data from <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a> was obtained by reading the
       procps version 0.97 code by Michael K. Johnson.

       The pattern matching code was adapted from code written by Ingo Wilken.
