</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>HylaFAX</u> is a telecommunication system for UNIX® systems.  Among the features of <u>HylaFAX</u> are:

       •  <u>HylaFAX</u>  runs  as a network service; this means a modem may be effectively shared by a large number of
          users.

       •  <u>HylaFAX</u> can be configured to work with a wide variety of modems on a wide variety of systems.

       •  Access to the system can be restricted by the administrator to selected hosts and/or users.

       •  Transmission requests may be processed immediately (default) or queued for processing at a later time,
          in the manner of the <u><a href="../man1/at.1.html">at</a></u>(1) command.

       •  Remote facsimile machines may be polled to retrieve publicly available documents.

       •  POSTSCRIPT®, PDF, and TIFF Class F documents are passed directly to the fax server  for  transmission;
          the  system  attempts to convert other file formats to either POSTSCRIPT or TIFF through the use of an
          extensible file typing and conversion facility.  In normal operation ASCII-text, <u><a href="../man1/troff.1.html">troff</a></u>(1) output,  and
          Silicon  Graphics  images  are  automatically  converted.   Additional  file formats can be added; see
          <u><a href="../man5/typerules.5.html">typerules</a></u>(5).

       •  The <u><a href="../man1/faxcover.1.html">faxcover</a></u>(1) program can be automatically invoked to create a cover page for each facsimile,  using
          information  deduced  by  the  <u>sendfax</u> command.  Alternatively, users may supply their own cover pages
          using their preferred tools.

       •  Facsimile are normally imaged in a system-default page size (usually letter-size pages, 8.5"  by  11",
          for  sites  in  North America).  Alternate page sizes can be specified with a <b>-s</b> option to all <u>HylaFAX</u>
          programs.  Well known page sizes include: ISO A3, ISO A4, ISO A5,  ISO  A6,  ISO  B4,  North  American
          Letter,  American  Legal,  American  Ledger,  American Executive, Japanese Letter, and Japanese Legal.
          Note that it may not be permissible to image into the full page area; the guaranteed reproducible area
          for a page is typically smaller.  Also, note that while arbitrary page sizes can be specified, only  a
          limited  number  of  page  dimensions  are  supported  by the facsimile protocol.  Thus if an odd-size
          facsimile is submitted for transmission it may not be possible to determine if it can  be  sent  until
          the fax server establishes communication with the remote facsimile machine.

       •  Facsimile  can  be  sent at low resolution (98 lines/inch) or medium resolution (196 lines/inch)—often
          called <u>fine</u> <u>mode</u>.  Documents with mixed resolution pages are handled correctly.

       •  Users are notified by electronic mail if a job can not be transmitted.  It is also possible to receive
          notification by mail when a job has been completed successfully and each time that the job is requeued
          for retransmission.  Any untransmitted documents are returned to the sender by electronic  mail  in  a
          form suitable for resubmission.

       •  Support  is provided for broadcasting facsimile.  The <u>HylaFAX</u> server software optimizes preparation of
          broadcast documents and the client applications support the notion of a  <u>job</u>  <u>group</u>  which  permits  a
          group of jobs to be manipulated together.

       •  Support  is provided for transmitting alpha-numeric messages to pager devices or GSM mobiles using the
          Simple Network Paging Protocol (SNPP) and the IXO or UCP protocol (for message delivery).

       The <u>HylaFAX</u> software is divided into two packages: software used on client machines and software used  on
       machines where one or more modems reside.  Client software includes:

       •  <u>sendfax</u>, a program to submit outgoing facsimile;

       •  <u>sendpage</u>, a program to submit alpha-numeric messages to SNPP servers;

       •  <u>faxstat</u>, a program obtain status information about <u>HylaFAX</u> servers;

       •  <u>faxrm</u>, a program to remove jobs and documents;

       •  <u>faxalter</u>, a program to change parameters of queued jobs; and

       •  <u>fax2ps</u>,  a  program  that converts facsimile documents to POSTSCRIPT so that they may be viewed with a
          POSTSCRIPT previewer or printed on a  POSTSCRIPT  printer  (this  program  is  actually  part  of  the
          companion TIFF distribution that is used by <u>HylaFAX</u>).

       Many systems also support submission of outgoing facsimile by electronic mail and/or graphical interfaces
       to  the  <u>sendfax</u>  program.   Such  facilities  are  site-dependent;  consult local documentation for more
       information.

</pre><h4><b>GETTING</b> <b>STARTED</b></h4><pre>
       To use the <u>HylaFAX</u> client software on your machine you need to either load the  appropriate  software  on
       your  machine,  or  you need to locate a machine that already has the client software installed and setup
       symbolic links to the appropriate directories.  If you choose the latter, then beware that you need links
       to three directories: the directory where client applications reside, <u><a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a></u>, the directory  where  the
       client  application  database  files  reside,  <u>/etc/hylafax</u>,  and the directory where document conversion
       programs reside, <u><a href="file:/usr/sbin">/usr/sbin</a></u> (the last two directories may be the same on your system).

       Once the software is setup on your machine you need to locate a host that has a facsimile server that you
       can use.  The host, and possibly the modem on the host, should be defined  in  your  environment  in  the
       FAXSERVER variable.  For example, for <u>csh</u> users,

              setenv FAXSERVER flake.asd

       or for <u>ksh</u> or <u>sh</u> users,

              FAXSERVER=flake.asd; export FAXSERVER

       If  there  are  multiple  modems  on  your  server then you may be assigned to use a specific modem.  For
       example, if you are to use the modem attached to the <u>ttym2</u> port on the server machine, then the FAXSERVER
       variable should be setup as

              FAXSERVER=<a href="mailto:ttym2@flake.asd">ttym2@flake.asd</a>; export FAXSERVER

       (Note: the SNPPSERVER environment variable is used instead of FAXSERVER by the <u>sendpage</u> program;  consult
       <u><a href="../man8/sendpage.8.html">sendpage</a></u>(8) for more information.)

       Note also, that before you can submit outgoing facsimile jobs the administrator for the facsimile  server
       may  need to register your identity in an access control list.  You will encounter the message ``<u>530</u> <u>User</u>
       <u>%s</u> <u>access</u> <u>denied.</u>''  if access to your server is controlled and you are not properly  registered  or  you
       may be prompted for a password and then denied service with ``<u>530</u> <u>Login</u> <u>incorrect.</u>''.

</pre><h4><b>DIAL</b> <b>STRINGS</b></h4><pre>
       A  dial  string  specifies  how  to dial the telephone in order to reach a destination facsimile machine.
       <u>HylaFAX</u> permits arbitrary strings to be passed to the facsimile server so that users can  specify  credit
       card  information, PBX routing information, etc.  Alphabetic characters are automatically mapped to their
       numeric key equivalents (e.g. ``1800GotMilk'' becomes ``18004686455'').  Other characters can be included
       for readability; anything that must be stripped will be removed by the server before the  dialing  string
       is  passed  to  the  fax  modem.   Private information such as credit card access codes are withheld from
       status messages and publicly accessible log files (with proper configuration).   Facsimile  servers  also
       automatically  insert  any  leading  dialing  prefixing strings that are required to place outgoing phone
       calls; e.g. dialing ``9'' to get an outside line.  Additionally, if a phone  number  is  fully  specified
       with  the  international  direct dialing digits (IDDD), then any prefixing long distance or international
       dialing codes that are required to place the call will be inserted in the dial string by the server.  For
       example,  ``+31.77.594.131''  is  a  phone  number  in  the  Netherlands;  it  would  be   converted   to
       ``0113177594131''  if  the  call  is placed in the United States.  The number ``+14159657824'' is a phone
       number in California; if this number is called from within the 415 area code in the United  States,  then
       the  server  would automatically convert this to ``9657824'' because in the San Francisco Bay Area, local
       phone calls must not include the area code and long distance prefixing code.

       The general rule in crafting dial strings is to specify exactly what you would dial  on  your  telephone;
       and,  in addition, the actual phone number can be specified in a location-independent manner by using the
       IDD syntax of ``+<u>country-code</u> <u>local-part</u>''.

</pre><h4><b>COVER</b> <b>PAGES</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>sendfax</u> program can automatically generate a cover page for  each  outgoing  facsimile.   Such  cover
       pages are actually created by the <u><a href="../man1/faxcover.1.html">faxcover</a></u>(1) program by using information that is deduced by <u>sendfax</u> and
       information  that  is  supplied  on  the command line invocation of <u>sendfax</u>.  Users may also request that
       <u>sendfax</u> not supply a cover page and then provide their own cover page as part of the data that is  to  be
       transmitted.

       Automatically-generated cover pages may include the following information:

       •  the sender's name, affiliation, geographic location, fax number, and voice telephone number;

       •  the recipient's name, affiliation, geographic location, fax number, and voice telephone number;

       •  text explaining what this fax is ``regarding'';

       •  text commentary;

       •  the local date and time that the job was submitted;

       •  the number of pages to be transmitted.

       Certain  of  this  information  is  currently  obtained  from  a user's personal facsimile database file;
       <b><a href="file:~/.faxdb">~/.faxdb</a></b>.  Note that this file is deprecated; it is described here only because it is still supported for
       compatibility with older versions of the software.

       The <b>.faxdb</b> file is an ASCII file with entries of the form

              <u>keyword</u> <b>:</b> <u>value</u>

       where <u>keyword</u> includes:

              <b>Name</b>          a name associated with destination fax machine;

              <b>Company</b>       a company name;

              <b>Location</b>      in-company locational information, e.g. a building#;

              <b>FAX-Number</b>    phone number of fax machine;

              <b>Voice-Number</b>  voice telephone number.

       Data is free format.  Whitespace (blank, tab, newline) can be freely interspersed with tokens.  If tokens
       include whitespace, they must be enclosed in quote marks  (``"'').   The  ``#''  character  introduces  a
       comment—everything to the end of the line is discarded.

       Entries  are  collected  into  aggregate  records  by enclosing them in ``[]''.  Records can be nested to
       create a hierarchy that that supports the inheritance of information—unspecified information is inherited
       from parent aggregate records.

       For example, a sample file might be:
              [   Company:   "Silicon Graphics, Inc."
                  Location: "Mountain View, California"
                  [ Name: "Sam Leffler"    FAX-Number: +1.415.965.7824 ]
              ]

       which could be extended to include another person at Silicon Graphics with the following:
              [   Company:   "Silicon Graphics, Inc."
                  Location: "Mountain View, California"
                  [ Name: "Sam Leffler"    FAX-Number: +1.415.965.7824 ]
                  [ Name: "Paul Haeberli"  FAX-Number: +1.415.965.7824 ]
              ]

       Experience indicates that the hierarchical nature of this database format makes it difficult to  maintain
       with  automated  mechanisms.   As  a result it is being replaced by other, more straightforward databases
       that are managed by programs that front-end the <u>sendfax</u> program.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>HylaFAX</u> client applications can be tailored on a per-user and per-site basis through configuration files.
       Per-site controls are placed in the file <b>/etc/hylafax/hyla.conf</b>, while per-user controls go in <b><a href="file:~/.hylarc">~/.hylarc</a></b>.
       In addition a few programs that have many parameters that are specific  to  their  operation  support  an
       additional configuration file; these files are identified in their manual pages.

       Configuration  files  have  a  simple format and are entirely ASCII.  A configuration parameter is of the
       form
            <b>tag</b>: <u>value</u>
       where a <u>tag</u> identifies a parameter and a <u>value</u> is either a string, number, or  boolean  value.   Comments
       are  introduced  by  the  ``#''  character and extend to the end of the line.  String values start at the
       first non-blank character after the ``:'' and continue to  the  first  non-whitespace  character  or,  if
       whitespace  is  to  be included, may be enclosed in quote marks (``"'').  String values enclosed in quote
       marks may also use the standard C programming conventions for specifying escape codes; e.g. ``\n'' for  a
       newline  character  and  ``\xxx''  for  an  octal value.  Numeric values are specified according to the C
       programming conventions (leading ``0x'' for hex, leading ``0'' for octal,  otherwise  decimal).   Boolean
       values  are  case  insensitive.   For a true value, either ``Yes'' or ``On'' should be used.  For a false
       value, use ``No'' or ``Off''.

</pre><h4><b>RECEIVED</b> <b>FACSIMILE</b></h4><pre>
       Incoming facsimile are received by facsimile servers and deposited in a receive queue  directory  on  the
       server  machine.   Depending  on  the  server's  configuration, files in this directory may or may not be
       readable by normal users.  The <u>faxstat</u> program can be used to view the  contents  of  the  receive  queue
       directory:
              hyla% faxstat -r
              HylaFAX scheduler on hyla.chez.sgi.com: Running
              Modem ttyf2 (+1 510 999-0123): Running and idle

              Protect Page  Owner        Sender/TSI  Recvd@ Filename
              -rw-r--    9  fax       1 510 5268781 05Jan96 fax00005.tif
              -rw-r--    8  fax       1 510 5268781 07Jan96 fax00009.tif
              -rw-r--    2  fax       1 510 5268781 07Jan96 fax00010.tif
              -rw-r--    3  fax        +14159657824 08Jan96 fax00011.tif
              -rw-r--    2  fax        +14159657824 08Jan96 fax00012.tif

       Consult the <u>faxstat</u> manual page for a more detailed description of this information.

       Received  facsimile  are  stored  as TIFF Class F files.  These files are bilevel images that are encoded
       using the CCITT T.4 or CCITT T.6 encoding algorithms.  The <u><a href="../man1/fax2ps.1.html">fax2ps</a></u>(1) program can  be  used  to  view  and
       print  these  files.   A  file  can  be  viewed by converting it to POSTSCRIPT and then viewing it with a
       suitable POSTSCRIPT previewing program, such as <u><a href="../man1/xpsview.1.html">xpsview</a></u>(1)  (Adobe's  Display  POSTSCRIPT-based  viewer),
       <u><a href="../man1/ghostview.1.html">ghostview</a></u>(1)  (a  public  domain previewer), or image viewer programs such as <u><a href="../man1/viewfax.1.html">viewfax</a></u>(1) (public domain),
       <u><a href="../man1/faxview.1.html">faxview</a></u>(1) (another public domain TIFF viewer  program),  <u><a href="../man1/xv.1.html">xv</a></u>(1)  (shareware  and/or  public  domain),  or
       <u><a href="../man1/xtiff.1.html">xtiff</a></u>(1)  (a  program  included  in  the  public  domain TIFF software distribution).  Consult your local
       resources to figure out what tools are available for viewing and printing received facsimile.

</pre><h4><b>CLIENT-SERVER</b> <b>PROTOCOL</b></h4><pre>
       <u>HylaFAX</u> client applications communicate  with  servers  using  either  a  special-purpose  <u>communications</u>
       <u>protocol</u>  that  is  modeled  after  the  Internet File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or, when submitting alpha-
       numeric pages, the Simple Network Paging Protocol (SNPP), specified in RFC  1861.   All  client  programs
       support  a  <b>-v</b>  option that can be used to observe the protocol message exchanges.  In some situations it
       may be more effective to communicate directly with a <u>HylaFAX</u> server  using  the  client-server  protocol.
       This  can  be  accomplished with an FTP or Telnet client application; though an FTP client is recommended
       because it implements the protocol needed to obtain server status information.  For  information  on  the
       server-side  support  provided with <u>HylaFAX</u> consult <u><a href="../man8/hfaxd.8.html">hfaxd</a></u>(8).  For documentation on the client-server fax
       protocol consult RFC XXXX (<u>to</u> <u>be</u> <u>filled</u> <u>in</u>).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       This section gives several examples of command line usage; consult the manual pages  for  the  individual
       commands for information on the options and program operation.

       The  following  command  queues the file <b>zall.ps</b> for transmission to John Doe at the number (123)456-7890
       using fine mode; the server will attempt to send it at 4:30 A.M.:
              sendfax -a "0430" -m -d "John <a href="mailto:Doe@1.123.456.7890">Doe@1.123.456.7890</a>" zall.ps
       (the leading ``1.'' is supplied to dial area code ``123'' in the United States.)

       The following command generates a one-page facsimile that is just a cover page:
              faxcover -t "John Doe" -n "(123)456-7890"
                  -c "Sorry John, I forgot the meeting..." |
                  sendfax -n -d "(123)456-7890"
       (note that the line was broken into several lines solely for presentation.)

       The following command displays the status of the facsimile server and any jobs queued for transmission:
              faxstat -s

       The following command displays the status of the facsimile  server  and  any  documents  waiting  in  the
       receive queue on the server machine:
              faxstat -r

       The  following  command  shows  how  to  use an FTP client program to communicate directly with a <u>HylaFAX</u>
       server:
              hyla% <b>ftp</b> <b>localhost</b> <b>hylafax</b>
