</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Vim</b>  is  a text editor that is upwards compatible to Vi.  It can be used to edit all kinds of plain text.
       It is especially useful for editing programs.

       There are a lot  of  enhancements  above  Vi:  multi  level  undo,  multi  windows  and  buffers,  syntax
       highlighting,  command  line  editing,  filename  completion,  on-line help, visual selection, etc..  See
       ":help vi_diff.txt" for a summary of the differences between <b>Vim</b> and Vi.

       While running <b>Vim</b> a lot of help can be obtained from the on-line help system, with the  ":help"  command.
       See the ON-LINE HELP section below.

       Most often <b>Vim</b> is started to edit a single file with the command

            vim file

       More generally <b>Vim</b> is started with:

            vim [options] [filelist]

       If the filelist is missing, the editor will start with an empty buffer.  Otherwise exactly one out of the
       following four may be used to choose one or more files to be edited.

       file ..     A  list  of filenames.  The first one will be the current file and read into the buffer.  The
                   cursor will be positioned on the first line of the buffer.  You can get to  the  other  files
                   with  the ":next" command.  To edit a file that starts with a dash, precede the filelist with
                   "--".

       -           The file to edit is read from stdin.  Commands are read from stderr, which should be a tty.

       -t {tag}    The file to edit and the initial cursor position depends on a "tag", a sort  of  goto  label.
                   {tag}  is  looked  up  in the tags file, the associated file becomes the current file and the
                   associated command is executed.  Mostly this is used for C  programs,  in  which  case  {tag}
                   could  be  a function name.  The effect is that the file containing that function becomes the
                   current file and the cursor  is  positioned  on  the  start  of  the  function.   See  ":help
                   tag-commands".

       -q [errorfile]
                   Start  in  quickFix mode.  The file [errorfile] is read and the first error is displayed.  If
                   [errorfile] is omitted, the filename is obtained from the  'errorfile'  option  (defaults  to
                   "AztecC.Err"  for the Amiga, "errors.err" on other systems).  Further errors can be jumped to
                   with the ":cn" command.  See ":help quickfix".

       <b>Vim</b> behaves differently, depending on the name of the command (the  executable  may  still  be  the  same
       file).

       vim       The "normal" way, everything is default.

       ex        Start  in  Ex  mode.  Go to Normal mode with the ":vi" command.  Can also be done with the "-e"
                 argument.

       view      Start in read-only mode.  You will be protected from writing the files.  Can also be done  with
                 the "-R" argument.

       gvim gview
                 The GUI version.  Starts a new window.  Can also be done with the "-g" argument.

       evim eview
                 The GUI version in easy mode.  Starts a new window.  Can also be done with the "-y" argument.

       rvim rview rgvim rgview
                 Like  the  above,  but  with restrictions.  It will not be possible to start shell commands, or
                 suspend <b>Vim.</b>  Can also be done with the "-Z" argument.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The options may be given in any order, before or after filenames.  Options without  an  argument  can  be
       combined after a single dash.

       +[num]      For  the  first  file  the cursor will be positioned on line "num".  If "num" is missing, the
                   cursor will be positioned on the last line.

       +/{pat}     For the first file the cursor will be positioned in the line with  the  first  occurrence  of
                   {pat}.  See ":help search-pattern" for the available search patterns.

       +{command}

       -c {command}
                   {command}  will  be executed after the first file has been read.  {command} is interpreted as
                   an Ex command.  If the {command} contains spaces it must be enclosed in double  quotes  (this
                   depends on the shell that is used).  Example: vim "+set si" main.c
                   Note: You can use up to 10 "+" or "-c" commands.

       -A          If  <b>Vim</b>  has  been  compiled with ARABIC support for editing right-to-left oriented files and
                   Arabic keyboard mapping, this option starts  <b>Vim</b>  in  Arabic  mode,  i.e.  'arabic'  is  set.
                   Otherwise an error message is given and <b>Vim</b> aborts.

       -b          Binary mode.  A few options will be set that makes it possible to edit a binary or executable
                   file.

       -C          Compatible.   Set  the  'compatible'  option.  This will make <b>Vim</b> behave mostly like Vi, even
                   though a .vimrc file exists.

       -d          Start in diff mode.  There should between two to eight file name arguments.   <b>Vim</b>  will  open
                   all the files and show differences between them.  Works like <a href="../man1/vimdiff.1.html">vimdiff</a>(1).

       -d {device}, -dev {device}
                   Open {device} for use as a terminal.  Only on the Amiga.  Example: "-d con:20/30/600/150".

       -D          Debugging.  Go to debugging mode when executing the first command from a script.

       -e          Start <b>Vim</b> in Ex mode, just like the executable was called "ex".

       -E          Start <b>Vim</b> in improved Ex mode, just like the executable was called "exim".

       -f          Foreground.   For the GUI version, <b>Vim</b> will not fork and detach from the shell it was started
                   in.  On the Amiga, <b>Vim</b> is not restarted to open a new window.  This  option  should  be  used
                   when  <b>Vim</b> is executed by a program that will wait for the edit session to finish (e.g. mail).
                   On the Amiga the ":sh" and ":!" commands will not work.

       -F          If <b>Vim</b> has been compiled with FKMAP support for  editing  right-to-left  oriented  files  and
                   Farsi  keyboard  mapping,  this option starts <b>Vim</b> in Farsi mode, i.e. 'fkmap' and 'rightleft'
                   are set.  Otherwise an error message is given and <b>Vim</b> aborts.
                   Note: Farsi support has been removed in patch 8.1.0932.

       -g          If <b>Vim</b> has been compiled with GUI support, this option enables the GUI.  If  no  GUI  support
                   was compiled in, an error message is given and <b>Vim</b> aborts.

       -H          If  <b>Vim</b> has been compiled with RIGHTLEFT support for editing right-to-left oriented files and
                   Hebrew keyboard mapping, this option starts <b>Vim</b> in Hebrew mode, i.e. 'hkmap' and  'rightleft'
                   are set.  Otherwise an error message is given and <b>Vim</b> aborts.

       -i {viminfo}
                   Specifies  the  filename  to  use  when  reading  or writing the viminfo file, instead of the
                   default "<a href="file:~/.viminfo">~/.viminfo</a>".  This can also be used to skip the use of the .viminfo file, by  giving
                   the name "NONE".

       -l          Lisp mode.  Sets the 'lisp' and 'showmatch' options on.

       -L          Same as -r.

       -m          Modifying  files  is  disabled.  Resets the 'write' option.  You can still modify the buffer,
                   but writing a file is not possible.

       -M          Modifications not allowed.  The 'modifiable' and 'write'  options  will  be  unset,  so  that
                   changes  are not allowed and files can not be written.  Note that these options can be set to
                   enable making modifications.

       -n          No swap file will be used.  Recovery after a crash will be impossible.  Handy if you want  to
                   edit  a file on a very slow medium (e.g. floppy).  Can also be done with ":set uc=0".  Can be
                   undone with ":set uc=200".

       -N          No-compatible mode.  Resets the 'compatible' option.  This will make <b>Vim</b> behave a bit better,
                   but less Vi compatible, even though a .vimrc file does not exist.

       -nb         Become an editor server for NetBeans.  See the docs for details.

       -o[N]       Open N windows stacked.  When N is omitted, open one window for each file.

       -O[N]       Open N windows side by side.  When N is omitted, open one window for each file.

       -p[N]       Open N tab pages.  When N is omitted, open one tab page for each file.

       -P {parent-title}
                   Win32 GUI only: Specify the title of the parent application.  When possible, Vim will run  in
                   an  MDI  window inside the application. {parent-title} must appear in the window title of the
                   parent application.  Make sure that it is specific enough. Note that  the  implementation  is
                   still primitive.  It won't work with all applications and the menu doesn't work.

       -r          List swap files, with information about using them for recovery.

       -r {file}   Recovery mode.  The swap file is used to recover a crashed editing session.  The swap file is
                   a file with the same filename as the text file with ".swp" appended.  See ":help recovery".

       -R          Read-only  mode.  The 'readonly' option will be set.  You can still edit the buffer, but will
                   be prevented from accidentally overwriting a file.  If you do want to overwrite a  file,  add
                   an exclamation mark to the Ex command, as in ":w!".  The -R option also implies the -n option
                   (see above).  The 'readonly' option can be reset with ":set noro".  See ":help 'readonly'".

       -s          Silent  mode.   Only  when  started as "Ex" or when the "-e" option was given before the "-s"
                   option.

       -s {scriptin}
                   The script file {scriptin} is read.  The characters in the file are interpreted as if you had
                   typed them.  The same can be done with the command ":source! {scriptin}".  If the end of  the
                   file is reached before the editor exits, further characters are read from the keyboard.

       -S {file}   {file}  will be sourced after the first file has been read.  This is equivalent to -c "source
                   {file}".  {file} cannot start with '-'.  If {file} is omitted  "Session.vim"  is  used  (only
                   works when -S is the last argument).

       -T {terminal}
                   Tells  <b>Vim</b>  the  name  of  the  terminal you are using.  Only required when the automatic way
                   doesn't work.  Should be a terminal known to <b>Vim</b> (builtin)  or  defined  in  the  termcap  or
                   terminfo file.

       -u {vimrc}  Use  the commands in the file {vimrc} for initializations.  All the other initializations are
                   skipped.  Use this to edit a special kind of  files.   It  can  also  be  used  to  skip  all
                   initializations  by  giving  the name "NONE".  See ":help initialization" within vim for more
                   details.

       -U {gvimrc} Use the  commands  in  the  file  {gvimrc}  for  GUI  initializations.   All  the  other  GUI
                   initializations  are  skipped.  It can also be used to skip all GUI initializations by giving
                   the name "NONE".  See ":help gui-init" within vim for more details.

       -v          Start <b>Vim</b> in Vi mode, just like the executable was called "vi".  This only  has  effect  when
                   the executable is called "ex".

       -V[N]       Verbose.   Give  messages about which files are sourced and for reading and writing a viminfo
                   file.  The optional number N is the value for 'verbose'.  Default is 10.

       -V[N]{filename}
                   Like -V and set 'verbosefile' to {filename}.  The result is that messages are  not  displayed
                   but written to the file {filename}.  {filename} must not start with a digit.

       -w{number}  Set the 'window' option to {number}.

       -w {scriptout}
                   All  the  characters  that you type are recorded in the file {scriptout}, until you exit <b>Vim.</b>
                   This is useful if you want to create a script file to be used with "vim  -s"  or  ":source!".
                   If the {scriptout} file exists, characters are appended.

       -W {scriptout}
                   Like -w, but an existing file is overwritten.

       -x          If  <b>Vim</b>  has  been compiled with encryption support, use encryption when writing files.  Will
                   prompt for a crypt key.

       -X          Don't connect to the X server.  Shortens startup time in a terminal, but the window title and
                   clipboard will not be used.

       -y          Start <b>Vim</b> in easy mode, just like the executable was called "evim"  or  "eview".   Makes  <b>Vim</b>
                   behave like a click-and-type editor.

       -Z          Restricted mode.  Works like the executable starts with "r".

       --          Denotes  the  end of the options.  Arguments after this will be handled as a file name.  This
                   can be used to edit a filename that starts with a '-'.

       --clean     Do not use any personal configuration (vimrc, plugins, etc.).  Useful to  see  if  a  problem
                   reproduces with a clean Vim setup.

       --cmd {command}
                   Like  using "-c", but the command is executed just before processing any vimrc file.  You can
                   use up to 10 of these commands, independently from "-c" commands.

       --echo-wid  GTK GUI only: Echo the Window ID on stdout.

       --gui-dialog-file {name}
                   When using the GUI, instead of showing a dialog, write the title and message of the dialog to
                   file {name}.  The file is created or appended to.  Only useful for testing, to avoid that the
                   test gets stuck on a dialog that can't be seen.  Without the GUI the argument is ignored.

       --help, -h, -?
                   Give a bit of help about the command line arguments and options.  After this <b>Vim</b> exits.

       --literal   Take file name arguments literally, do not expand wildcards.  This  has  no  effect  on  Unix
                   where the shell expands wildcards.

       --log {filename}
                   If  <b>Vim</b>  has  been compiled with eval and channel feature, start logging and write entries to
                   {filename}. This works like calling <u>ch_logfile({filename},</u> <u>'ao')</u> very early during startup.

       --nofork    Foreground.  For the GUI version, <b>Vim</b> will not fork and detach from the shell it was  started
                   in.

       --noplugin  Skip loading plugins.  Implied by -u NONE.

       --not-a-term
                   Tells  <b>Vim</b>  that  the user knows that the input and/or output is not connected to a terminal.
                   This will avoid the warning and the two second delay that would happen.

       --remote    Connect to a Vim server and make it edit the files given in the rest of the arguments.  If no
                   server is found a warning is given and the files are edited in the current Vim.

       --remote-expr {expr}
                   Connect to a Vim server, evaluate {expr} in it and print the result on stdout.

       --remote-send {keys}
                   Connect to a Vim server and send {keys} to it.

       --remote-silent
                   As --remote, but without the warning when no server is found.

       --remote-wait
                   As --remote, but Vim does not exit until the files have been edited.

       --remote-wait-silent
                   As --remote-wait, but without the warning when no server is found.

       --serverlist
                   List the names of all Vim servers that can be found.

       --servername {name}
                   Use {name} as the server name.  Used for  the  current  Vim,  unless  used  with  a  --remote
                   argument, then it's the name of the server to connect to.

       --socketid {id}
                   GTK GUI only: Use the GtkPlug mechanism to run gVim in another window.

       --startuptime {file}
                   During startup write timing messages to the file {fname}.

       --ttyfail   When stdin or stdout is not a a terminal (tty) then exit right away.

       --version   Print version information and exit.

       --windowid {id}
                   Win32 GUI only: Make gVim try to use the window {id} as a parent, so that it runs inside that
                   window.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       Most of <b>Vim</b> was made by Bram Moolenaar, with a lot of help from others.  See ":help credits" in <b>Vim.</b>
       <b>Vim</b> is based on Stevie, worked on by: Tim Thompson, Tony Andrews and G.R. (Fred) Walter.  Although hardly
       any of the original code remains.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Probably.  See ":help todo" for a list of known problems.

       Note that a number of things that may be regarded as bugs by some, are in fact caused by  a  too-faithful
       reproduction of Vi's behaviour.  And if you think other things are bugs "because Vi does it differently",
       you should take a closer look at the vi_diff.txt file (or type :help vi_diff.txt when in Vim).  Also have
       a look at the 'compatible' and 'cpoptions' options.
