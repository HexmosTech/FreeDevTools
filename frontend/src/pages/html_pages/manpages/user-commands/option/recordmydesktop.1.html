       <b>recordmydesktop</b> <b>--print-config</b>

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       <b>recordMyDesktop</b>  produces  a  file  (<u>out.ogv</u>  by  default) containing a video and audio recording of an X
       Window System session.

       For a typical scenario, recording your session is as simple as
              $ <b>recordmydesktop</b>
       which will produce a full-screen recording named <u>out.ogv</u> in the  current  working  directory,  while  the
       command
              $ <b>recordmydesktop</b> <b>../foo</b>
       will save the recording in <u>foo.ogv</u> in the parent of the current working directory.

       To end a recording, press <b>Control+C</b>.  (This action sends a <b>SIGINT</b> to <b>recordMyDesktop</b>.)

       To designate a region of the screen for recording you can type this:
              $ <b>recordmydesktop</b> <b>-x</b> <u>x-pos</u> <b>-y</b> <u>y-pos</u> <b>--width</b> <u>w</u> <b>--height</b> <u>h</u> <b>-o</b> <b>foo.ogv</b>
       where  <u>x-pos</u> and <u>y-pos</u> specify the offset in pixels from the upper-left corner of your screen and <u>w</u> and <u>h</u>
       the size of the region to be recorded, again  in  pixels.   If  the  area  extends  beyond  your  current
       resolution, you will be notified appropriately and nothing will happen.

       <u>Note</u>:  If  <u>any</u>  options are used, and you wish to use an output filename other than the default, you must
       specify it with the <b>-o</b> option.

       Since version 0.3 of <b>recordMyDesktop</b>, encoding is done immediately after recording finishes.  While  this
       behavior  saves  a  lot  of  CPU,  you  can revert to the old one by specifying the <b>--on-the-fly-encoding</b>
       option.

       The default behavior of recording is to mark areas that have changed  (as  determined  by  the  X  Damage
       extension) and update the frame.  This behavior can be changed through the option <b>--full-shots</b> to produce
       a  more  accurate result or capture windows that do not generate X events on change, such as windows with
       accelerated 3D context, but this will notably increase the workload.

       <b>recordMyDesktop</b> doesn't have a user interface in the  conventional  sense.   After  startup,  it  can  be
       controlled only through the following signals:

       <b>SIGUSR1</b>
              causes the program to pause if it's currently recording, and vice-versa.

       <b>SIGTERM</b>
       <b>SIGINT</b> cause normal termination of the recording.

       <b>SIGABRT</b>
              terminates the program and removes the output file.

       These  signals  can also be delivered to the application through the configuration of keyboard shortcuts.
       See <b>--pause-shortcut</b> and <b>--stop-shortcut</b> in the <b>Miscellaneous</b> subsection of the <b>Options</b> section below.

       For further manipulation of the end result, consult the <b>Options</b> and <b>Notes</b> sections below.

</pre><h4><b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       If <u>and</u> <u>only</u> <u>if</u> no options are specified, <b>recordMyDesktop</b> accepts a single operand which it interprets  as
       an output filename.

       <b>recordMyDesktop</b> accepts many command-line options.  The following discussion groups them into families.

   <b>General</b>
       <b>-h</b> or <b>--help</b>
              Print a summary of usage and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
              Print program version and exit.

       <b>--print-config</b>
              Print information about options selected during compilation and exit.  Currently indicates whether
              Jack capture is enabled and if ALSA or OSS is used; may report more information in the future.

   <b>Image</b>
       <b>--windowid</b> <u>wid</u>
              Record  the  region  of  the  screen corresponding to the X window <u>wid</u> at the time <b>recordMyDesktop</b>
              starts.  Recording a window doesn't track the window  itself,  but  instead  the  region  that  it
              covers;  if the window is moved, <b>recordMyDesktop</b> does not follow it.  If the window is obscured by
              another, the obscuring window's contents within the recording region are captured.  An X  client's
              window ID can be obtained with the <b><a href="../man1/xwininfo.1.html">xwininfo</a></b>(1) program; see the <b>Notes</b> section below.

       <b>--display</b> <u>x-display</u>
              Connect  to  the  X  Window  System  display  at  <u>x-display</u>.  By default, the value of the <b>DISPLAY</b>
              environment variable are used to the determine the display.

       <b>-x</b> <u>x-offset</u>
              Restrict the recording region to start at <u>x-offset</u> pixels from the left edge of the screen or  the
              X window ID designated with <b>--windowid.</b>  The default is 0.

       <b>-y</b> <u>y-offset</u>
              Restrict the recording region to start at <u>y-offset</u> pixels from the top edge of the screen or the X
              window ID designated with <b>--windowid.</b>  The default is 0.

       <b>--width</b> <u>w</u>
              Restrict  the  recording region to <u>w</u> pixels in width.  The default is the full width of the screen
              or the X window ID designated with <b>--windowid.</b>

       <b>--height</b> <u>h</u>
              Restrict the recording region to <u>h</u> pixels in height.  The default is the full height of the screen
              or the X window ID designated with <b>--windowid.</b>

       <b>--dummy-cursor</b> <u>color</u>
              Draw a dummy cursor instead of the normal one.  The given <u>color</u> must be a string,  either  “<b>black</b>”
              or “<b>white</b>”.

       <b>--no-cursor</b>
              Disable drawing of the cursor.

       <b>--no-shared</b>
              Do not use the MIT shared memory extension (MIT-SHM).  <u>Use</u> <u>of</u> <u>this</u> <u>option</u> <u>is</u> <u>not</u> <u>recommended.</u>

       <b>--full-shots</b>
              Take a full screenshot at every frame.  <u>Use</u> <u>of</u> <u>this</u> <u>option</u> <u>is</u> <u>not</u> <u>recommended.</u>

       <b>--follow-mouse</b>
              When  this  option is enabled, the capture area follows the mouse cursor.  This is meaningful only
              when the selected area is a subset of the full screen.  This option implies <b>--full-shots</b>.

       <b>--quick-subsampling</b>
              Sub-sample chroma planes by discarding extra pixels.

       <b>--fps</b> <u>n</u>
              Attempt to capture <u>n</u> frames per second, where <u>n</u> is positive and may be an  integral  or  floating-
              point  number.   The achievable frame rate is limited by your system's hardware and workload.  The
              default is 15.

   <b>Sound</b>
       <b>--channels</b> <u>n</u>
              Record up to <u>n</u> channels, where <u>n</u> is a positive integer.  The default is 2 (stereo).

       <b>--freq</b> <u>n</u>
              Record at a sample rate of <u>n</u> hertz, where <u>n</u> is a positive integer.  The default  is  22050  (22.05
              kHz).

       <b>--buffer-size</b> <u>n</u>
              Buffer  <u>n</u>  bytes  of  sound  data  when using the ALSA or OSS sound systems, where <u>n</u> is a positive
              integer.  The default is 4096 (4 kiB).

       <b>--ring-buffer-size</b> <u>n</u>
              Set the size of the JACK ring buffer in seconds, where <u>n</u> is a positive floating-point number.  The
              default is 3.0.

              The total size of the buffer in bytes can be expressed as a C language expression:
              ring_buffer_size * sample_rate * number_of_ports
                      * sizeof(jack_default_audio_sample_t),
              where sizeof(jack_default_audio_sample_t) is normally 4.

       <b>--device</b> <u>sound-device</u>
              Capture audio from <u>sound-device</u>.  The default is <u>default</u> or <u>/dev/dsp</u>, depending on whether ALSA or
              OSS is used, respectively.

       <b>--use-jack</b> <u>port</u> ...
              Record audio from the specified list of space-separated JACK ports.  When using this  option,  all
              other audio-related options (except <b>--no-sound</b>) are ignored.

       <b>--no-sound</b>
              Do not record sound.

   <b>Encoding</b>
       <b>--on-the-fly-encoding</b>
              Encode  the  audio/video  data  while  recording.   The  default  is to defer encoding until after
              recording is complete.

       <b>--v_quality</b> <u>n</u>
              Set the desired video quality to <u>n</u>, an integer between 0 and 63 inclusive; higher is better.   The
              default is 63.  See the <b>Notes</b> section below.

       <b>--v_bitrate</b> <u>n</u>
              Set  the  desired  bit rate of the encoded video to <u>n</u> bits per second.  The accepted range of <u>n</u> is
              between 0 and 200,000,000 inclusive; the default is 0.  (The thousands separator is shown here for
              clarity; do not use it in the option argument.)

       <b>--s_quality</b> <u>n</u>
              Set the desired audio quality to <u>n</u>, an integer between -1 and 10 inclusive; higher is better.  The
              default is 10.

   <b>Miscellaneous</b>
       <b>--rescue</b> <u>path-to-data</u>
              Encode cache data from a previous session into an Ogg Theora file.  The filename will be  the  one
              that  was  chosen  initially.  Any other option specified with this one will be implicitly ignored
              and <b>recordMyDesktop</b> will  exit  after  the  end  of  the  encoding.   This  option  was  added  in
              <b>recordMyDesktop</b>  0.3.7 and it will not work with cache files produced from earlier versions.  When
              using this option, note that <b>recordMyDesktop</b>'s cache is not safe with respect to data  type  sizes
              and endianness.  To locate the cached data, see the <b>--workdir</b> option below.

       <b>--no-wm-check</b>
              When a 3D compositing window manager is detected, the program will function as if the <b>--full-shots</b>
              option had been specified.  This option disables the check.

       <b>--no-frame</b>
              Normally,  a  frame  is drawn around the recording region to assist the user to identify what does
              and doesn't get captured.  When the <b>--follow-mouse</b> is given,  this  frame  will  also  follow  the
              pointer  around.  However, the frame might cause problems for drag-and-drop operations.  If you do
              not wish this frame to appear, use this option.

       <b>--pause-shortcut</b> <u>mod</u><b>+</b><u>key</u>
              Designate a key combination to  toggle  the  pause  state  of  the  recording.   <u>mod</u>  can  be  any
              combination  of  the following modifier keys: Control, Shift, and Mod1 to Mod5.  The modifiers can
              be separated by any character (<u>except</u> <u>a</u> <u>space</u>) or none at all.  <u>key</u> can  be  any  key  defined  in
              <u>/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h</u>. Omit the XK_ prefixes to the key names found in that file.  The list
              of  modifiers must be separated from the key with a plus sign “+”.  The default is <b>Control+Mod1+p</b>.
              (Mod1 usually corresponds to the left Alt key).

       <b>--stop-shortcut</b> <u>mod</u><b>+</b><u>key</u>
              Designate a key combination to stop the recording.  For details, see <b>--pause-shortcut</b> above.   The
              default is <b>Control+Mod1+s</b>.

       <b>--compress-cache</b>
              Image data are cached with a light compression.

       <b>--workdir</b> <u>dir</u>
              <b>recordMyDesktop</b> creates a temporary directiory in <u>dir</u> to cache intermediate files.  The default is
              read from the environment variable <b>TMPDIR</b> if set, otherwise <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u> is used.

       <b>--delay</b> <u>n</u>[<b>H</b>|<b>h</b>|<b>M</b>|<b>m</b>]
              Wait  <u>n</u> units of time (seconds, if not specified) before starting the recording, where <u>n</u> is a non-
              negative integral or floating-point value.  An optional suffix of <b>H</b> or <b>h</b>, <b>M</b> or <b>m</b>;  indicates  time
              units of hours or minutes, respectively.  The default is no delay.

       <b>--overwrite</b>
              If  the  output  filename  already  exists,  delete  it.   The  default is to refuse to overwrite,
              interpolating a numeric discriminator into the filename instead (see the <b>Files</b> section below).

       <b>-o</b> <u>filename</u>
              Write the encoded video to <u>filename</u>.  The default is <u>out.ogv</u>.

</pre><h4><b>Exit</b> <b>Status</b></h4><pre>
       An exit status of 0 means success per the usual Unix conventions.

       A non-zero exit status means that an error occurred; these are accompanied by diagnostic messages to  the
       standard error.  Furthermore, several exceptional conditions are distinguished by exit status.

       1      Argument parsing failed or argument input was nonsensical.

       2      Encoder initialization failed (Vorbis or Theora).

       3      Could not open or configure sound device.

       4      XDamage extension is not present.

       5      MIT-SHM extension is not present.

       6      XFixes extension is not present.

       7      <b><a href="../man3/XInitThreads.3.html">XInitThreads</a></b>(3) failed.

       8      The <b>DISPLAY</b> environment variable is not set and no <b>--display</b> option was specified.

       9      Could not connect to the X server.

       10     The color depth of the root window is not 32, 24, or 16 bits per pixel.

       11     The recording window specification was invalid.

       12     Could not attach shared memory to process.

       13     Could not open file for writing.

</pre><h4><b>Environment</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DISPLAY</b>
              specifies  the  X  server  to  connect  to.   For  typical use cases, this variable is already set
              correctly in the environment and corresponds to the X display the user is already interacting with
              (in other words, <b>recordMyDesktop</b> “does the right thing”).  See section <b>Display</b> <b>Names</b> in  <b><a href="../man7/X.7.html">X</a></b>(7)  for
              more information.

</pre><h4><b>Files</b></h4><pre>
       <b>recordMyDesktop</b>  adds  the  suffix  <u>.ogv</u> to any output filename that does not already possess one (in any
       letter case).

       If you try to save to a filename that  already  exists,  a  numeric  discriminator  of  the  form  <u>-n</u>  is
       interpolated  into  the  filename before the <u>.ogv</u> suffix.  The number <u>n</u> starts at 1 and is incremented if
       the filename with that discriminator exists already.

       For example, when not specifying a name, if <u>out.ogv</u> exists, the new file will be <u>out-1.ogv</u>, and  if  that
       exists too, <u>out-2.ogv</u> is used, and so on <u>ad</u> <u>infinitum</u> (not really, more like <u>ad</u> <u>unsigned</u> <u>short</u>).

</pre><h4><b>Notes</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Recoding</b> <b>using</b> <b>an</b> <b>X</b> <b>window</b> <b>ID</b>
       When using the <b>--windowid</b> option, read carefully its description in the <b>Options</b> section above, as well as
       those of the <b>-x</b>, <b>-y</b>, <b>--width</b>, and <b>--height</b> options.

       An easy way to find out the ID of a window is by using the <b><a href="../man1/xwininfo.1.html">xwininfo</a></b>(1) program.  Running a command like
              $ <b>xwininfo</b> <b>|</b> <b>awk</b> <b>'/Window</b> <b>id:/</b> <b>{print</b> <b>$4}'</b>
       will  report  only  the  window  ID,  which  will  be  a  hexadecimal  integer  in C literal format, like
       “0x4800005”.  More conveniently, you can put all that in the command that launches  <b>recordMyDesktop</b>  like
       this:
              $ <b>recordmydesktop</b> <b>--windowid</b> <b>$(xwininfo</b> <b>|</b> <b>awk</b> <b>'/Window</b> <b>id:/</b> <b>{print</b> <b>$4}')</b>

   <b>Tuning</b> <b>the</b> <b>video</b> <b>quality</b>
       The  lower  the  quality  you select on a video recording (by using the <b>--v_quality</b> option), the more CPU
       performance you will require.  So if you are also using the <b>--on-the-fly-encoding</b> option, it's better  to
       start  with default values and manipulate the end result with another program.  An excellent converter is
       the <b><a href="../man1/vlc.1.html">vlc</a></b>(1) media player, which can perform a variety of transcoding operations, using either a  graphical
       interface  or the command line.  <b>vlc</b> is a complex piece of software; you should consult its documentation
       before using it.  An example follows which will resize a recording named <u>out.ogv</u> to 512×384.
              $ <b>vlc</b> <b>-I</b> <b>dummy</b> <b>out.ogv</b> <b>vlc:quit</b> <b>--sout</b> <b>"#transcode{</b> <b>vcodec</b> <b>=</b> <b>theo,</b>  <b>width</b>  <b>=</b>  <b>512,</b>  <b>height</b>  <b>=</b>  <b>384</b>
              <b>}:duplicate{</b> <b>dst</b> <b>=</b> <b>std{</b> <b>access</b> <b>=</b> <b>file,</b> <b>mux=ogg,</b> <b>dst</b> <b>=</b> <b>\"out_512x384.ogv\"</b> <b>}}"</b>

       If  you wish to change the video quality you can append the option <b>--sout-theora-quality=</b><u>n</u>, with <u>n</u> in the
       range [1,10]; for example,
              $ <b>vlc</b> <b>-I</b> <b>dummy</b> <b>out.ogv</b> <b>vlc:quit</b> <b>--sout</b> <b>"#transcode{</b> <b>vcodec</b> <b>=</b> <b>theo,</b>  <b>width</b>  <b>=</b>  <b>512,</b>  <b>height</b>  <b>=</b>  <b>384</b>
              <b>}:duplicate{</b>   <b>dst</b>   <b>=</b>   <b>std{</b>   <b>access</b>   <b>=</b>   <b>file,</b>   <b>mux=ogg,</b>   <b>dst</b>   <b>=</b>   <b>\"out_512x384.ogv\"</b>  <b>}}"</b>
              <b>--sout-theora-quality=3</b>
       produces a file of a video quality 18 (in a range of 0–63), appropriate for web publishing.

       Another option  is  <b><a href="../man1/ffmpeg2theora.1.html">ffmpeg2theora</a></b>(1),  which—despite  its  name—is  also  a  Theora-to-Theora  converter.
       Changing the quality of a recordng with it can be as simple as:
              $ <b>ffmpeg2theora</b> <b>infile.ogv</b> <b>-v</b> <b>3</b> <b>-a</b> <b>4</b> <b>-o</b> <b>outfile.ogv</b>
       It can even perform resizing on the geometry of the recording, or change the overall duration.

</pre><h4><b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       •      Does not record 3D windows if <b>--full-shots</b> isn't specified.

       •      Saving  65536 files with the same name will result in unpredictable behavior, which might manifest
              as an endless loop or a segmentation fault.
