</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       zshoptions - zsh options

</pre><h4><b>SPECIFYING</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options are primarily referred to by name.  These names are case insensitive and underscores are ignored.
       For example, `<b>allexport</b>' is equivalent to `<b>A__lleXP_ort</b>'.

       The  sense of an option name may be inverted by preceding it with `<b>no</b>', so `<b>setopt</b> <b>No_Beep</b>' is equivalent
       to `<b>unsetopt</b> <b>beep</b>'.  This inversion can only be done once, so `<b>nonobeep</b>' is <u>not</u>  a  synonym  for  `<b>beep</b>'.
       Similarly, `<b>tify</b>' is not a synonym for `<b>nonotify</b>' (the inversion of `<b>notify</b>').

       Some options also have one or more single letter names.  There are two sets of single letter options: one
       used by default, and another used to emulate <b>sh</b>/<b>ksh</b> (used when the <b>SH_OPTION_LETTERS</b> option is set).  The
       single  letter  options  can  be  used  on  the  shell command line, or with the <b>set</b>, <b>setopt</b> and <b>unsetopt</b>
       builtins, as normal Unix options preceded by `<b>-</b>'.

       The sense of the single letter options may be inverted by using `<b>+</b>' instead of `<b>-</b>'.  Some of  the  single
       letter  option names refer to an option being off, in which case the inversion of that name refers to the
       option being on.  For example, `<b>+n</b>' is the short name of `<b>exec</b>', and  `<b>-n</b>'  is  the  short  name  of  its
       inversion, `<b>noexec</b>'.

       In  strings  of  single  letter  options  supplied  to  the shell at startup, trailing whitespace will be
       ignored; for example the string `<b>-f</b>    ' will be treated just as `<b>-f</b>', but the string `<b>-f</b> <b>i</b>' is an error.
       This is because many systems which implement the `<b>#!</b>' mechanism for calling scripts do not strip trailing
       whitespace.

       It is possible for options to be set within  a  function  scope.   See  the  description  of  the  option
       <b>LOCAL_OPTIONS</b> below.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b> <b>OF</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In the following list, options set by default in all emulations are marked &lt;D&gt;; those set by default only
       in  csh,  ksh,  sh, or zsh emulations are marked &lt;C&gt;, &lt;K&gt;, &lt;S&gt;, &lt;Z&gt; as appropriate.  When listing options
       (by `<b>setopt</b>', `<b>unsetopt</b>', `<b>set</b> <b>-o</b>' or `<b>set</b> <b>+o</b>'), those turned on by default appear in the  list  prefixed
       with `<b>no</b>'.  Hence (unless <b>KSH_OPTION_PRINT</b> is set), `<b>setopt</b>' shows all options whose settings are changed
       from the default.

   <b>Changing</b> <b>Directories</b>
       <b>AUTO_CD</b> (<b>-J</b>)
              If  a command is issued that can't be executed as a normal command, and the command is the name of
              a directory, perform the <b>cd</b> command to that directory.  This option  is  only  applicable  if  the
              option  <b>SHIN_STDIN</b>  is  set,  i.e.  if commands are being read from standard input.  The option is
              designed for interactive use; it is recommended that <b>cd</b> be used explicitly  in  scripts  to  avoid
              ambiguity.

       <b>AUTO_PUSHD</b> (<b>-N</b>)
              Make <b>cd</b> push the old directory onto the directory stack.

       <b>CDABLE_VARS</b> (<b>-T</b>)
              If the argument to a <b>cd</b> command (or an implied <b>cd</b> with the <b>AUTO_CD</b> option set) is not a directory,
              and does not begin with a slash, try to expand the expression as if it were preceded by a `<b>~</b>' (see
              the section `Filename Expansion').

       <b>CD_SILENT</b>
              Never  print the working directory after a <b>cd</b> (whether explicit or implied with the <b>AUTO_CD</b> option
              set). <b>cd</b> normally prints the working directory when the argument given to it was <b>-</b>, a stack entry,
              or the name of  a  directory  found  under  <b>CDPATH</b>.  Note  that  this  is  distinct  from  <b>pushd</b>'s
              stack-printing  behaviour,  which  is  controlled  by  <b>PUSHD_SILENT</b>.  This  option  overrides  the
              printing-related effects of <b>POSIX_CD</b>.

       <b>CHASE_DOTS</b>
              When changing to a directory containing a path segment `<b>..</b>' which would otherwise  be  treated  as
              canceling  the  previous  segment  in the path (in other words, `<b>foo/..</b>' would be removed from the
              path, or if `<b>..</b>' is the first part of the path, the last part of  the  current  working  directory
              would  be removed), instead resolve the path to the physical directory.  This option is overridden
              by <b>CHASE_LINKS</b>.

              For example, suppose <b>/foo/bar</b> is a link to the directory <b>/alt/rod</b>.  Without this option  set,  `<b>cd</b>
              <b>/foo/bar/..</b>'  changes  to  <b>/foo</b>; with it set, it changes to <b>/alt</b>.  The same applies if the current
              directory is <b>/foo/bar</b> and `<b>cd</b> <b>..</b>' is used.  Note that all other symbolic links in  the  path  will
              also be resolved.

       <b>CHASE_LINKS</b> (<b>-w</b>)
              Resolve  symbolic links to their true values when changing directory.  This also has the effect of
              <b>CHASE_DOTS</b>, i.e. a `<b>..</b>' path segment will be treated as referring to the physical parent, even  if
              the preceding path segment is a symbolic link.

       <b>POSIX_CD</b> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              Modifies the behaviour of <b>cd</b>, <b>chdir</b> and <b>pushd</b> commands to make them more compatible with the POSIX
              standard. The behaviour with the option unset is described in the documentation for the <b>cd</b> builtin
              in  <u><a href="../man1/zshbuiltins.1.html">zshbuiltins</a></u>(1).   If  the  option  is set, the shell does not test for directories beneath the
              local directory (`<b>.</b>') until after all directories in <b>cdpath</b> have been tested, and the <b>cd</b> and <b>chdir</b>
              commands do not recognise arguments of the form `{<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>}<u>n</u>' as directory stack entries.

              Also, if the option is set, the conditions under which the shell prints the  new  directory  after
              changing  to it are modified.  It is no longer restricted to interactive shells (although printing
              of the directory stack with <b>pushd</b> is still limited to  interactive  shells);  and  any  use  of  a
              component of <b>CDPATH</b>, including a `<b>.</b>' but excluding an empty component that is otherwise treated as
              `<b>.</b>', causes the directory to be printed.

       <b>PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS</b>
              Don't push multiple copies of the same directory onto the directory stack.

       <b>PUSHD_MINUS</b>
              Exchanges the meanings of `<b>+</b>' and `<b>-</b>' when used with a number to specify a directory in the stack.

       <b>PUSHD_SILENT</b> (<b>-E</b>)
              Do not print the directory stack after <b>pushd</b> or <b>popd</b>.

       <b>PUSHD_TO_HOME</b> (<b>-D</b>)
              Have <b>pushd</b> with no arguments act like `<b>pushd</b> <b>$HOME</b>'.

   <b>Completion</b>
       <b>ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT</b> &lt;D&gt;
              If  unset, key functions that list completions try to return to the last prompt if given a numeric
              argument. If set these functions try to return to the last prompt if given <u>no</u> numeric argument.

       <b>ALWAYS_TO_END</b>
              If a completion is performed with the cursor within a word, and a full completion is inserted, the
              cursor is moved to the end of the word.  That is, the cursor is moved to the end of  the  word  if
              either a single match is inserted or menu completion is performed.

       <b>AUTO_LIST</b> (<b>-9</b>) &lt;D&gt;
              Automatically list choices on an ambiguous completion.

       <b>AUTO_MENU</b> &lt;D&gt;
              Automatically use menu completion after the second consecutive request for completion, for example
              by pressing the tab key repeatedly. This option is overridden by <b>MENU_COMPLETE</b>.

       <b>AUTO_NAME_DIRS</b>
              Any  parameter that is set to the absolute name of a directory immediately becomes a name for that
              directory, that will be used by the `<b>%~</b>' and related prompt sequences, and will be available  when
              completion  is  performed  on a word starting with `<b>~</b>'.  (Otherwise, the parameter must be used in
              the form `<b>~</b><u>param</u>' first.)

       <b>AUTO_PARAM_KEYS</b> &lt;D&gt;
              If a parameter name was completed and a  following  character  (normally  a  space)  automatically
              inserted,  and  the next character typed is one of those that have to come directly after the name
              (like `<b>}</b>', `<b>:</b>', etc.), the automatically added character is deleted, so that the  character  typed
              comes  immediately  after  the  parameter  name.   Completion  in  a  brace  expansion is affected
              similarly: the added character is a `<b>,</b>', which will be removed if `<b>}</b>' is typed next.

       <b>AUTO_PARAM_SLASH</b> &lt;D&gt;
              If a parameter is completed whose content is the name of a directory, then add  a  trailing  slash
              instead of a space.

       <b>AUTO_REMOVE_SLASH</b> &lt;D&gt;
              When  the  last character resulting from a completion is a slash and the next character typed is a
              word delimiter, a slash, or a character that ends a command (such as a semicolon or an ampersand),
              remove the slash.

       <b>BASH_AUTO_LIST</b>
              On an ambiguous completion, automatically list choices when  the  completion  function  is  called
              twice  in  succession.   This  takes  precedence over <b>AUTO_LIST</b>.  The setting of <b>LIST_AMBIGUOUS</b> is
              respected.  If <b>AUTO_MENU</b> is set, the menu behaviour will then start with the  third  press.   Note
              that  this  will  not  work  with <b>MENU_COMPLETE</b>, since repeated completion calls immediately cycle
              through the list in that case.

       <b>COMPLETE_ALIASES</b>
              Prevents aliases on the command line  from  being  internally  substituted  before  completion  is
              attempted.  The effect is to make the alias a distinct command for completion purposes.

       <b>COMPLETE_IN_WORD</b>
              If  unset,  the  cursor is set to the end of the word if completion is started. Otherwise it stays
              there and completion is done from both ends.

       <b>GLOB_COMPLETE</b>
              When the current word has a glob pattern, do not insert all the words resulting from the expansion
              but generate matches as for completion and cycle through them like <b>MENU_COMPLETE</b>. The matches  are
              generated  as  if  a  `<b>*</b>'  was  added  to  the  end  of  the  word, or inserted at the cursor when
              <b>COMPLETE_IN_WORD</b> is set.  This actually uses pattern matching, not globbing, so it works not  only
              for files but for any completion, such as options, user names, etc.

              Note  that  when  the  pattern matcher is used, matching control (for example, case-insensitive or
              anchored matching) cannot be used.  This limitation only applies when the current word contains  a
              pattern; simply turning on the <b>GLOB_COMPLETE</b> option does not have this effect.

       <b>HASH_LIST_ALL</b> &lt;D&gt;
              Whenever  a  command  completion or spelling correction is attempted, make sure the entire command
              path is hashed first.  This makes the first completion slower but avoids false reports of spelling
              errors.

       <b>LIST_AMBIGUOUS</b> &lt;D&gt;
              This option works when <b>AUTO_LIST</b> or <b>BASH_AUTO_LIST</b> is also set.  If there is an unambiguous prefix
              to insert on the command line, that is done without a completion list being  displayed;  in  other
              words,  auto-listing  behaviour  only  takes place when nothing would be inserted.  In the case of
              <b>BASH_AUTO_LIST</b>, this means that the list will be delayed to the third call of the function.

       <b>LIST_BEEP</b> &lt;D&gt;
              Beep on an ambiguous completion.  More accurately, this forces the completion  widgets  to  return
              status  1  on  an  ambiguous completion, which causes the shell to beep if the option <b>BEEP</b> is also
              set; this may be modified if completion is called from a user-defined widget.

       <b>LIST_PACKED</b>
              Try to make the completion list smaller (occupying less lines) by printing the matches in  columns
              with different widths.

       <b>LIST_ROWS_FIRST</b>
              Lay  out  the matches in completion lists sorted horizontally, that is, the second match is to the
              right of the first one, not under it as usual.

       <b>LIST_TYPES</b> (<b>-X</b>) &lt;D&gt;
              When listing files that are possible completions, show the type  of  each  file  with  a  trailing
              identifying mark.

       <b>MENU_COMPLETE</b> (<b>-Y</b>)
              On  an  ambiguous  completion, instead of listing possibilities or beeping, insert the first match
              immediately.  Then when completion is requested again, remove  the  first  match  and  insert  the
              second  match,  etc.   When  there  are  no  more  matches,  go  back  to  the  first  one  again.
              <b>reverse-menu-complete</b> may be used to loop through the list in the  other  direction.  This  option
              overrides <b>AUTO_MENU</b>.

       <b>REC_EXACT</b> (<b>-S</b>)
              If the string on the command line exactly matches one of the possible completions, it is accepted,
              even  if  there  is  another  completion  (i.e.  that  string with something else added) that also
              matches.

   <b>Expansion</b> <b>and</b> <b>Globbing</b>
       <b>BAD_PATTERN</b> (<b>+2</b>) &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
              If a pattern for filename generation is badly formed, print an error message.  (If this option  is
              unset, the pattern will be left unchanged.)

       <b>BARE_GLOB_QUAL</b> &lt;Z&gt;
              In a glob pattern, treat a trailing set of parentheses as a qualifier list, if it contains no `<b>|</b>',
              `<b>(</b>' or (if special) `<b>~</b>' characters.  See the section `Filename Generation'.

       <b>BRACE_CCL</b>
              Expand  expressions  in  braces  which  would not otherwise undergo brace expansion to a lexically
              ordered list of all the characters.  See the section `Brace Expansion'.

       <b>CASE_GLOB</b> &lt;D&gt;
              Make globbing (filename generation) sensitive to case.  Note  that  other  uses  of  patterns  are
              always  sensitive to case.  If the option is unset, the presence of any character which is special
              to filename generation will cause case-insensitive matching.  For example, <b>cvs(/)</b>  can  match  the
              directory  <b>CVS</b>  owing  to  the  presence of the globbing flag (unless the option <b>BARE_GLOB_QUAL</b> is
              unset).

       <b>CASE_MATCH</b> &lt;D&gt;
              Make regular expressions using the <b>zsh/regex</b> module (including matches with <b>=~</b>) sensitive to case.

       <b>CASE_PATHS</b>
              If <b>CASE_PATHS</b> is not set (the  default),  <b>CASE_GLOB</b>  affects  the  interpretation  of  <u>every</u>  path
              component,  whenever  a  special character appears in <u>any</u> component.  When <b>CASE_PATHS</b> is set, file
              path components that do <u>not</u> contain special filename generation characters are always sensitive to
              case, thus restricting <b>NO_CASE_GLOB</b> to components that contain globbing characters.

              Note that if the filesystem itself is not sensitive to case, then <b>CASE_PATHS</b> has no effect.

       <b>CSH_NULL_GLOB</b> &lt;C&gt;
              If a pattern for filename generation has no matches, delete the pattern from the argument list; do
              not report an error unless all the patterns in a command have no matches.  Overrides <b>NOMATCH</b>.

       <b>EQUALS</b> &lt;Z&gt;
              Perform <b>=</b> filename expansion.  (See the section `Filename Expansion'.)

       <b>EXTENDED_GLOB</b>
              Treat the `<b>#</b>', `<b>~</b>' and `<b>^</b>' characters as part of  patterns  for  filename  generation,  etc.   (An
              initial unquoted `<b>~</b>' always produces named directory expansion.)

       <b>FORCE_FLOAT</b>
              Constants  in  arithmetic  evaluation  will be treated as floating point even without the use of a
              decimal point; the values of integer variables will be converted to floating point  when  used  in
              arithmetic expressions.  Integers in any base will be converted.

       <b>GLOB</b> (<b>+F</b>, ksh: <b>+f</b>) &lt;D&gt;
              Perform filename generation (globbing).  (See the section `Filename Generation'.)

       <b>GLOB_ASSIGN</b> &lt;C&gt;
              If  this  option  is  set,  filename  generation (globbing) is performed on the right hand side of
              scalar parameter assignments of the form `<u>name</u><b>=</b><u>pattern</u> (e.g. `<b>foo=*</b>').  If  the  result  has  more
              than  one  word  the  parameter will become an array with those words as arguments. This option is
              provided for backwards compatibility only: globbing is always performed on the right hand side  of
              array  assignments  of  the  form `<u>name</u><b>=(</b><u>value</u><b>)</b>' (e.g. `<b>foo=(*)</b>') and this form is recommended for
              clarity; with this option set, it is not possible to predict whether the result will be  an  array
              or a scalar.

       <b>GLOB_DOTS</b> (<b>-4</b>)
              Do not require a leading `<b>.</b>' in a filename to be matched explicitly.

       <b>GLOB_STAR_SHORT</b>
              When this option is set and the default zsh-style globbing is in effect, the pattern `<b>**/*</b>' can be
              abbreviated  to `<b>**</b>' and the pattern `<b>***/*</b>' can be abbreviated to <b>***</b>.  Hence `<b>**.c</b>' finds a file
              ending in <b>.c</b> in any subdirectory, and `<b>***.c</b>' does the same while also following  symbolic  links.
              A  <b>/</b>  immediately  after  the  `<b>**</b>' or `<b>***</b>' forces the pattern to be treated as the unabbreviated
              form.

       <b>GLOB_SUBST</b> &lt;C&gt; &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              Treat any characters resulting from parameter expansion as being eligible for  filename  expansion
              and  filename generation, and any characters resulting from command substitution as being eligible
              for filename generation.  Braces (and commas in between) do not become eligible for expansion.

       <b>HIST_SUBST_PATTERN</b>
              Substitutions using the <b>:s</b> and <b>:&amp;</b> history modifiers are performed with pattern matching instead of
              string matching.  This occurs wherever history modifiers are valid, including glob qualifiers  and
              parameters.  See the section `Modifiers' in <u><a href="../man1/zshexpn.1.html">zshexpn</a></u>(1).

       <b>IGNORE_BRACES</b> (<b>-I</b>) &lt;S&gt;
              Do  not  perform  brace  expansion.   For  historical reasons this also includes the effect of the
              <b>IGNORE_CLOSE_BRACES</b> option.

       <b>IGNORE_CLOSE_BRACES</b>
              When neither this  option  nor  <b>IGNORE_BRACES</b>  is  set,  a  sole  close  brace  character  `<b>}</b>'  is
              syntactically  significant  at any point on a command line.  This has the effect that no semicolon
              or newline is necessary before the brace terminating a function or current shell construct.   When
              either  option  is  set,  a  closing  brace is syntactically significant only in command position.
              Unlike <b>IGNORE_BRACES</b>, this option does not disable brace expansion.

              For example, with both options unset a function may be defined in the following fashion:

                     <b>args()</b> <b>{</b> <b>echo</b> <b>$#</b> <b>}</b>

              while if either option is set, this does not work and something equivalent  to  the  following  is
              required:

                     <b>args()</b> <b>{</b> <b>echo</b> <b>$#;</b> <b>}</b>

       <b>KSH_GLOB</b> &lt;K&gt;
              In  pattern  matching, the interpretation of parentheses is affected by a preceding `<b>@</b>', `<b>*</b>', `<b>+</b>',
              `<b>?</b>' or `<b>!</b>'.  See the section `Filename Generation'.

       <b>MAGIC_EQUAL_SUBST</b>
              All unquoted arguments of the form `<u>anything</u><b>=</b><u>expression</u>' appearing after  the  command  name  have
              filename expansion (that is, where <u>expression</u> has a leading `<b>~</b>' or `<b>=</b>') performed on <u>expression</u> as
              if  it were a parameter assignment.  The argument is not otherwise treated specially; it is passed
              to the command as a single argument, and not used as an actual parameter assignment.  For example,
              in <b>echo</b> <b>foo=<a href="file:~/bar">~/bar</a>:<a href="file:~/rod">~/rod</a></b>, both occurrences of <b>~</b> would be replaced.  Note that this  happens  anyway
              with <b>typeset</b> and similar statements.

              This  option  respects the setting of the <b>KSH_TYPESET</b> option.  In other words, if both options are
              in effect, arguments looking like assignments will not undergo word splitting.

       <b>MARK_DIRS</b> (<b>-8</b>, ksh: <b>-X</b>)
              Append a trailing `<b>/</b>' to all directory names resulting from filename generation (globbing).

       <b>MULTIBYTE</b> &lt;D&gt;
              Respect multibyte characters when found in strings.  When this option is set, strings are examined
              using the system library to determine how many bytes form a character, depending  on  the  current
              locale.   This  affects  the  way characters are counted in pattern matching, parameter values and
              various delimiters.

              The option is on by default if the shell was compiled with <b>MULTIBYTE_SUPPORT</b>; otherwise it is  off
              by default and has no effect if turned on.

              If  the  option  is  off  a  single byte is always treated as a single character.  This setting is
              designed purely for examining strings known to contain raw bytes or other values that may  not  be
              characters  in  the  current  locale.   It is not necessary to unset the option merely because the
              character set for the current locale does not contain multibyte characters.

              The option does not affect the  shell's  editor,   which  always  uses  the  locale  to  determine
              multibyte  characters.   This  is  because the character set displayed by the terminal emulator is
              independent of shell settings.

       <b>NOMATCH</b> (<b>+3</b>) &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
              If a pattern for filename generation has no  matches,  print  an  error,  instead  of  leaving  it
              unchanged in the argument list.  This also applies to file expansion of an initial `<b>~</b>' or `<b>=</b>'.

       <b>NULL_GLOB</b> (<b>-G</b>)
              If  a  pattern  for  filename generation has no matches, delete the pattern from the argument list
              instead of reporting an error.  Overrides <b>NOMATCH</b>.

       <b>NUMERIC_GLOB_SORT</b>
              If numeric filenames are matched by a filename generation pattern, sort the filenames  numerically
              rather than lexicographically.

       <b>RC_EXPAND_PARAM</b> (<b>-P</b>)
              Array  expansions  of  the  form  `<u>foo</u><b>${</b><u>xx</u><b>}</b><u>bar</u>',  where  the  parameter  <u>xx</u> is set to <b>(</b><u>a</u> <u>b</u> <u>c</u><b>)</b>, are
              substituted with `<u>fooabar</u> <u>foobbar</u> <u>foocbar</u>' instead of the default `<u>fooa</u> <u>b</u>  <u>cbar</u>'.   Note  that  an
              empty array will therefore cause all arguments to be removed.

       <b>REMATCH_PCRE</b>
              If  set,  regular  expression  matching  with  the  <b>=~</b>  operator  will use Perl-Compatible Regular
              Expressions from the PCRE library.  (The <b>zsh/pcre</b> module must be available.)  If not set,  regular
              expressions will use the extended regexp syntax provided by the system libraries.

       <b>SH_GLOB</b> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              Disables  the  special  meaning  of `<b>(</b>', `<b>|</b>', `<b>)</b>' and '<b>&lt;</b>' for globbing the result of parameter and
              command substitutions, and in some other places where the shell accepts patterns.  If  <b>SH_GLOB</b>  is
              set  but  <b>KSH_GLOB</b> is not, the shell allows the interpretation of subshell expressions enclosed in
              parentheses in some cases where there is no space before the opening parenthesis, e.g. <b>!(true)</b>  is
              interpreted as if there were a space after the <b>!</b>.  This option is set by default if zsh is invoked
              as <b>sh</b> or <b>ksh</b>.

       <b>UNSET</b> (<b>+u</b>, ksh: <b>+u</b>) &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
              Treat  unset  parameters  as  if  they were empty when substituting, and as if they were zero when
              reading their values in arithmetic expansion and arithmetic commands.  Otherwise they are  treated
              as an error.

       <b>WARN_CREATE_GLOBAL</b>
              Print  a  warning  message when a global parameter is created in a function by an assignment or in
              math context.  This often indicates that a parameter has not been declared local  when  it  should
              have  been.   Parameters explicitly declared global from within a function using <b>typeset</b> <b>-g</b> do not
              cause a warning.  Note that there is no warning when a local parameter is assigned to in a  nested
              function, which may also indicate an error.

       <b>WARN_NESTED_VAR</b>
              Print a warning message when an existing parameter from an enclosing function scope, or global, is
              set  in  a  function  by an assignment or in math context.  Assignment to shell special parameters
              does not cause a warning.  This is the companion to <b>WARN_CREATE_GLOBAL</b> as in this case the warning
              is only printed when a parameter is <u>not</u> created.  Where possible, use of <b>typeset</b>  <b>-g</b>  to  set  the
              parameter  suppresses  the  error, but note that this needs to be used every time the parameter is
              set.  To restrict the effect of this option to a single function scope, use `<b>functions</b> <b>-W</b>'.

              For example, the following code produces a warning for the assignment inside the  function  <b>nested</b>
              as that overrides the value within <b>toplevel</b>

                     <b>toplevel()</b> <b>{</b>
                       <b>local</b> <b>foo="in</b> <b>fn"</b>
                       <b>nested</b>
                     <b>}</b>
                     <b>nested()</b> <b>{</b>
                          <b>foo="in</b> <b>nested"</b>
                     <b>}</b>
                     <b>setopt</b> <b>warn_nested_var</b>
                     <b>toplevel</b>

   <b>History</b>
       <b>APPEND_HISTORY</b> &lt;D&gt;
              If  this  is  set,  zsh  sessions  will append their history list to the history file, rather than
              replace it. Thus, multiple parallel zsh sessions will all have the new entries from their  history
              lists added to the history file, in the order that they exit.  The file will still be periodically
              re-written  to  trim it when the number of lines grows 20% beyond the value specified by <b>$SAVEHIST</b>
              (see also the <b>HIST_SAVE_BY_COPY</b> option).

       <b>BANG_HIST</b> (<b>+K</b>) &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
              Perform textual history expansion, <b>csh</b>-style, treating the character `<b>!</b>' specially.

       <b>EXTENDED_HISTORY</b> &lt;C&gt;
              Save each command's beginning timestamp (in seconds since the epoch) and the duration (in seconds)
              to the history file.  The format of this prefixed data is:

              `<b>:</b> <u>&lt;beginning</u> <u>time&gt;</u><b>:</b><u>&lt;elapsed</u> <u>seconds&gt;</u><b>;</b><u>&lt;command&gt;</u>'.

       <b>HIST_ALLOW_CLOBBER</b>
              Add `<b>|</b>' to output redirections in the history.  This allows history references  to  clobber  files
              even when <b>CLOBBER</b> is unset.

       <b>HIST_BEEP</b> &lt;D&gt;
              Beep in ZLE when a widget attempts to access a history entry which isn't there.

       <b>HIST_EXPIRE_DUPS_FIRST</b>
              If  the  internal history needs to be trimmed to add the current command line, setting this option
              will cause the oldest history event that has a duplicate to be lost before losing a  unique  event
              from  the  list.  You should be sure to set the value of <b>HISTSIZE</b> to a larger number than <b>SAVEHIST</b>
              in order to give you some room for the duplicated events, otherwise this option will  behave  just
              like <b>HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS</b> once the history fills up with unique events.

       <b>HIST_FCNTL_LOCK</b>
              When writing out the history file, by default zsh uses ad-hoc file locking to avoid known problems
              with locking on some operating systems.  With this option locking is done by means of the system's
              <b>fcntl</b>  call,  where this method is available.  On recent operating systems this may provide better
              performance, in particular avoiding history corruption when files are stored on NFS.

       <b>HIST_FIND_NO_DUPS</b>
              When searching for history entries in the line  editor,  do  not  display  duplicates  of  a  line
              previously found, even if the duplicates are not contiguous.

       <b>HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS</b>
              If  a  new command line being added to the history list duplicates an older one, the older command
              is removed from the list (even if it is not the previous event).

       <b>HIST_IGNORE_DUPS</b> (<b>-h</b>)
              Do not enter command lines into the history list if they are duplicates of the previous event.

       <b>HIST_IGNORE_SPACE</b> (<b>-g</b>)
              Remove command lines from the history list when the first character on the line  is  a  space,  or
              when  one  of  the  expanded aliases contains a leading space.  Only normal aliases (not global or
              suffix aliases) have this behaviour.  Note that the command lingers in the internal history  until
              the  next  command  is entered before it vanishes, allowing you to briefly reuse or edit the line.
              If you want to make it vanish right away without entering another command, type a space and  press
              return.

       <b>HIST_LEX_WORDS</b>
              By default, shell history that is read in from files is split into words on all white space.  This
              means  that  arguments with quoted whitespace are not correctly handled, with the consequence that
              references to words in history lines that have been read from a file may be inaccurate.  When this
              option is set, words read in from a history file are divided up in a  similar  fashion  to  normal
              shell  command line handling.  Although this produces more accurately delimited words, if the size
              of the history file is large this can be slow.  Trial and error is necessary to decide.

       <b>HIST_NO_FUNCTIONS</b>
              Remove function definitions from the history list.  Note that the function lingers in the internal
              history until the next command is entered before it vanishes, allowing you  to  briefly  reuse  or
              edit the definition.

       <b>HIST_NO_STORE</b>
              Remove  the  <b>history</b>  (<b>fc</b>  <b>-l</b>)  command from the history list when invoked.  Note that the command
              lingers in the internal history until the next command is entered before it vanishes, allowing you
              to briefly reuse or edit the line.

       <b>HIST_REDUCE_BLANKS</b>
              Remove superfluous blanks from each command line being added to the history list.

       <b>HIST_SAVE_BY_COPY</b> &lt;D&gt;
              When the history file is re-written, we normally write out a copy of the file named  <b>$HISTFILE.new</b>
              and  then  rename  it over the old one.  However, if this option is unset, we instead truncate the
              old history file and write out the new version in-place.  If one of the history-appending  options
              is  enabled,  this option only has an effect when the enlarged history file needs to be re-written
              to trim it down to size.  Disable this only if you have  special  needs,  as  doing  so  makes  it
              possible to lose history entries if zsh gets interrupted during the save.

              When  writing  out  a copy of the history file, zsh preserves the old file's permissions and group
              information, but will refuse to write out a new file if it would change the history file's owner.

       <b>HIST_SAVE_NO_DUPS</b>
              When writing out the history file, older commands that duplicate newer ones are omitted.

       <b>HIST_VERIFY</b>
              Whenever the user enters a line with history expansion, don't execute the line directly;  instead,
              perform history expansion and reload the line into the editing buffer.

       <b>INC_APPEND_HISTORY</b>
              This  option  works  like  <b>APPEND_HISTORY</b> except that new history lines are added to the <b>$HISTFILE</b>
              incrementally (as soon as they are entered), rather than waiting until the shell exits.  The  file
              will  still  be  periodically  re-written to trim it when the number of lines grows 20% beyond the
              value specified by <b>$SAVEHIST</b> (see also the <b>HIST_SAVE_BY_COPY</b> option).

       <b>INC_APPEND_HISTORY_TIME</b>
              This option is a variant of <b>INC_APPEND_HISTORY</b> in which, where  possible,  the  history  entry  is
              written  out  to  the file after the command is finished, so that the time taken by the command is
              recorded correctly in the history file in <b>EXTENDED_HISTORY</b> format.  This means  that  the  history
              entry  will not be available immediately from other instances of the shell that are using the same
              history file.

              This option is only useful if <b>INC_APPEND_HISTORY</b> and <b>SHARE_HISTORY</b>  are  turned  off.   The  three
              options should be considered mutually exclusive.

       <b>SHARE_HISTORY</b> &lt;K&gt;

              This  option  both imports new commands from the history file, and also causes your typed commands
              to be appended to the history file (the latter is like specifying <b>INC_APPEND_HISTORY</b>, which should
              be turned off if this option is in effect).  The history lines are also output with timestamps ala
              <b>EXTENDED_HISTORY</b> (which makes it easier to find the spot where we left off reading the file  after
              it gets re-written).

              By default, history movement commands visit the imported lines as well as the local lines, but you
              can  toggle this on and off with the set-local-history zle binding.  It is also possible to create
              a zle widget that will make some commands ignore imported commands, and some include them.

              If you find that you want more control over when commands get  imported,  you  may  wish  to  turn
              <b>SHARE_HISTORY</b> off, <b>INC_APPEND_HISTORY</b> or <b>INC_APPEND_HISTORY_TIME</b> (see above) on, and then manually
              import commands whenever you need them using `<b>fc</b> <b>-RI</b>'.

   <b>Initialisation</b>
       <b>ALL_EXPORT</b> (<b>-a</b>, ksh: <b>-a</b>)
              All parameters subsequently defined are automatically exported.

       <b>GLOBAL_EXPORT</b> &lt;Z&gt;
              If  this  option is set, passing the <b>-x</b> flag to the builtins <b>declare</b>, <b>float</b>, <b>integer</b>, <b>readonly</b> and
              <b>typeset</b> (but not <b>local</b>) will also set the <b>-g</b> flag;  hence parameters exported to  the  environment
              will not be made local to the enclosing function, unless they were already or the flag <b>+g</b> is given
              explicitly.   If  the option is unset, exported parameters will be made local in just the same way
              as any other parameter.

              This option is set by default for backward compatibility; it is not recommended that its behaviour
              be relied upon.  Note that the builtin <b>export</b> always sets both the <b>-x</b> and <b>-g</b> flags, and hence  its
              effect  extends  beyond  the  scope  of  the  enclosing function; this is the most portable way to
              achieve this behaviour.

       <b>GLOBAL_RCS</b> (<b>+d</b>) &lt;D&gt;
              If this option is unset, the startup files <b>/etc/zsh/zprofile</b>, <b>/etc/zsh/zshrc</b>, <b>/etc/zsh/zlogin</b>  and
              <b>/etc/zsh/zlogout</b> will not be run.  It can be disabled and re-enabled at any time, including inside
              local startup files (<b>.zshrc</b>, etc.).

       <b>RCS</b> (<b>+f</b>) &lt;D&gt;
              After  <b>/etc/zsh/zshenv</b>  is  sourced  on startup, source the <b>.zshenv</b>, <b>/etc/zsh/zprofile</b>, <b>.zprofile</b>,
              <b>/etc/zsh/zshrc</b>, <b>.zshrc</b>, <b>/etc/zsh/zlogin</b>, <b>.zlogin</b>, and <b>.zlogout</b> files, as described in the  section
              `Files'.   If  this  option  is  unset,  the <b>/etc/zsh/zshenv</b> file is still sourced, but any of the
              others will not be; it can be set at any time to prevent the remaining  startup  files  after  the
              currently executing one from being sourced.

   <b>Input/Output</b>
       <b>ALIASES</b> &lt;D&gt;
              Expand aliases.

       <b>CLOBBER</b> (<b>+C</b>, ksh: <b>+C</b>) &lt;D&gt;
              Allows  `<b>&gt;</b>'  redirection  to  truncate  existing  files.   Otherwise  `<b>&gt;!</b>' or `<b>&gt;|</b>' must be used to
              truncate a file.

              If the option is not set, and the option <b>APPEND_CREATE</b> is also not set, `<b>&gt;&gt;!</b>'  or  `<b>&gt;&gt;|</b>'  must  be
              used to create a file.  If either option is set, `<b>&gt;&gt;</b>' may be used.

       <b>CLOBBER_EMPTY</b>
              This option is only used if the option <b>CLOBBER</b> is not set: note that it is set by default.

              If  this  option  is set, then regular files of zero length may be ovewritten (`clobbered').  Note
              that it is possible another process has written to the file between this test and use of the  file
              by  the  current  process.   This  option  should therefore not be used in cases where files to be
              clobbered may be written to asynchronously.

       <b>CORRECT</b> (<b>-0</b>)
              Try to correct the spelling of commands.  Note that, when the <b>HASH_LIST_ALL</b> option is not  set  or
              when  some  directories  in the path are not readable, this may falsely report spelling errors the
              first time some commands are used.

              The shell variable <b>CORRECT_IGNORE</b> may be set to a pattern  to  match  words  that  will  never  be
              offered as corrections.

       <b>CORRECT_ALL</b> (<b>-O</b>)
              Try to correct the spelling of all arguments in a line.

              The shell variable <b>CORRECT_IGNORE_FILE</b> may be set to a pattern to match file names that will never
              be offered as corrections.

       <b>DVORAK</b> Use  the Dvorak keyboard instead of the standard qwerty keyboard as a basis for examining spelling
              mistakes for the <b>CORRECT</b> and <b>CORRECT_ALL</b> options and the <b>spell-word</b> editor command.

       <b>FLOW_CONTROL</b> &lt;D&gt;
              If this option is unset, output flow control via start/stop characters (usually assigned to ^S/^Q)
              is disabled in the shell's editor.

       <b>IGNORE_EOF</b> (<b>-7</b>)
              Do not exit on end-of-file.  Require the use of <b>exit</b> or <b>logout</b> instead.  However, ten  consecutive
              EOFs will cause the shell to exit anyway, to avoid the shell hanging if its tty goes away.

              Also,  if  this  option  is  set  and  the  Zsh  Line Editor is used, widgets implemented by shell
              functions can be bound to EOF (normally Control-D) without printing the  normal  warning  message.
              This works only for normal widgets, not for completion widgets.

       <b>INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS</b> (<b>-k</b>) &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              Allow comments even in interactive shells.

       <b>HASH_CMDS</b> &lt;D&gt;
              Note  the  location  of each command the first time it is executed.  Subsequent invocations of the
              same command will use the saved location, avoiding a path search.  If this  option  is  unset,  no
              path  hashing is done at all.  However, when <b>CORRECT</b> is set, commands whose names do not appear in
              the functions or aliases hash tables are hashed in order  to  avoid  reporting  them  as  spelling
              errors.

       <b>HASH_DIRS</b> &lt;D&gt;
              Whenever  a  command  name is hashed, hash the directory containing it, as well as all directories
              that occur earlier in the path.  Has no effect if neither <b>HASH_CMDS</b> nor <b>CORRECT</b> is set.

       <b>HASH_EXECUTABLES_ONLY</b>
              When hashing commands because of <b>HASH_CMDS</b>, check that the  file  to  be  hashed  is  actually  an
              executable.   This  option is unset by default as if the path contains a large number of commands,
              or consists of many remote files, the additional tests can take a long time.  Trial and  error  is
              needed to show if this option is beneficial.

       <b>MAIL_WARNING</b> (<b>-U</b>)
              Print a warning message if a mail file has been accessed since the shell last checked.

       <b>PATH_DIRS</b> (<b>-Q</b>)
              Perform  a path search even on command names with slashes in them.  Thus if `<b><a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a></b>' is in
              the user's path, and he or she types `<b>X11/xinit</b>', the command `<b>/usr/local/bin/X11/xinit</b>'  will  be
              executed  (assuming  it  exists).   Commands  explicitly beginning with `<b>/</b>', `<b>./</b>' or `<b>../</b>' are not
              subject to the path search.  This also applies to the `<b>.</b>' and <b>source</b> builtins.

              Note that subdirectories of the current directory are always searched for executables specified in
              this form.  This takes place before any search indicated by this option, and regardless of whether
              `<b>.</b>' or the current directory appear in the command search path.

       <b>PATH_SCRIPT</b> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              If this option is not set, a script passed as the first non-option  argument  to  the  shell  must
              contain  the  name  of the file to open.  If this option is set, and the script does not specify a
              directory path, the script is looked for first in the current directory, then in the command path.
              See the section INVOCATION in <u><a href="../man1/zsh.1.html">zsh</a></u>(1).

       <b>PRINT_EIGHT_BIT</b>
              Print eight bit characters literally in completion lists, etc.  This option is  not  necessary  if
              your system correctly returns the printability of eight bit characters (see <u><a href="../man3/ctype.3.html">ctype</a></u>(3)).

       <b>PRINT_EXIT_VALUE</b> (<b>-1</b>)
              Print the exit value of programs with non-zero exit status.  This is only available at the command
              line in interactive shells.

       <b>RC_QUOTES</b>
              Allow  the  character  sequence `<b>''</b>' to signify a single quote within singly quoted strings.  Note
              this does not apply in quoted strings using the format <b>$'</b><u>...</u><b>'</b>, where a  backslashed  single  quote
              can be used.

       <b>RM_STAR_SILENT</b> (<b>-H</b>) &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              Do not query the user before executing `<b>rm</b> <b>*</b>' or `<b>rm</b> <b>path/*</b>'.

       <b>RM_STAR_WAIT</b>
              If  querying  the  user  before executing `<b>rm</b> <b>*</b>' or `<b>rm</b> <b>path/*</b>', first wait ten seconds and ignore
              anything typed in that time.  This avoids the problem of reflexively answering `yes' to the  query
              when  one didn't really mean it.  The wait and query can always be avoided by expanding the `<b>*</b>' in
              ZLE (with tab).

       <b>SHORT_LOOPS</b> &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
              Allow the short forms of <b>for</b>, <b>repeat</b>, <b>select</b>, <b>if</b>, and <b>function</b> constructs.

       <b>SHORT_REPEAT</b>
              Allow the short form <b>repeat</b> as <b>SHORT_LOOPS</b> but without enabling it for the other constructs.

       <b>SUN_KEYBOARD_HACK</b> (<b>-L</b>)
              If a line ends with a backquote, and there are an odd number of backquotes on the line, ignore the
              trailing backquote.  This is useful on some keyboards where the return key is too small,  and  the
              backquote  key lies annoyingly close to it.  As an alternative the variable <b>KEYBOARD_HACK</b> lets you
              choose the character to be removed.

   <b>Job</b> <b>Control</b>
       <b>AUTO_CONTINUE</b>
              With this option set, stopped jobs that are removed from the job table  with  the  <b>disown</b>  builtin
              command are automatically sent a <b>CONT</b> signal to make them running.

       <b>AUTO_RESUME</b> (<b>-W</b>)
              Treat  single word simple commands without redirection as candidates for resumption of an existing
              job.

       <b>BG_NICE</b> (<b>-6</b>) &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
              Run all background jobs at a lower priority.  This option is set by default.

       <b>CHECK_JOBS</b> &lt;Z&gt;
              Report the status of background and suspended jobs before exiting a  shell  with  job  control;  a
              second  attempt  to  exit  the shell will succeed.  <b>NO_CHECK_JOBS</b> is best used only in combination
              with <b>NO_HUP</b>, else such jobs will be killed automatically.

              The check is omitted if the commands run from the previous command line included a `<b>jobs</b>' command,
              since it is assumed the user is aware that there are  background  or  suspended  jobs.   A  `<b>jobs</b>'
              command  run from one of the hook functions defined in the section SPECIAL FUNCTIONS in <u><a href="../man1/zshmisc.1.html">zshmisc</a></u>(1)
              is not counted for this purpose.

       <b>CHECK_RUNNING_JOBS</b> &lt;Z&gt;
              Check for both running and suspended jobs  when  <b>CHECK_JOBS</b>  is  enabled.   When  this  option  is
              disabled, zsh checks only for suspended jobs, which matches the default behavior of bash.

              This option has no effect unless <b>CHECK_JOBS</b> is set.

       <b>HUP</b> &lt;Z&gt;
              Send the <b>HUP</b> signal to running jobs when the shell exits.

       <b>LONG_LIST_JOBS</b> (<b>-R</b>)
              Print job notifications in the long format by default.

       <b>MONITOR</b> (<b>-m</b>, ksh: <b>-m</b>)
              Allow job control.  Set by default in interactive shells.

       <b>NOTIFY</b> (<b>-5</b>, ksh: <b>-b</b>) &lt;Z&gt;
              Report the status of background jobs immediately, rather than waiting until just before printing a
              prompt.

       <b>POSIX_JOBS</b> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              This option makes job control more compliant with the POSIX standard.

              When the option is not set, the <b>MONITOR</b> option is unset on entry to subshells, so that job control
              is  no longer active.  When the option is set, the <b>MONITOR</b> option and job control remain active in
              the subshell, but note that the subshell has no access to jobs in the parent shell.

              When the option is not set, jobs put in the background or foreground with <b>bg</b> or <b>fg</b>  are  displayed
              with  the  same information that would be reported by <b>jobs</b>.  When the option is set, only the text
              is printed.  The output from <b>jobs</b> itself is not affected by the option.

              When the option is not set, job information from the parent shell is saved  for  output  within  a
              subshell  (for  example,  within a pipeline).  When the option is set, the output of <b>jobs</b> is empty
              until a job is started within the subshell.

              In previous versions of the shell, it was necessary to enable <b>POSIX_JOBS</b> in order for the  builtin
              command  <b>wait</b>  to return the status of background jobs that had already exited.  This is no longer
              the case.

   <b>Prompting</b>
       <b>PROMPT_BANG</b> &lt;K&gt;
              If set, `<b>!</b>' is treated specially in prompt  expansion.   See  EXPANSION  OF  PROMPT  SEQUENCES  in
              <u><a href="../man1/zshmisc.1.html">zshmisc</a></u>(1).

       <b>PROMPT_CR</b> (<b>+V</b>) &lt;D&gt;
              Print  a  carriage return just before printing a prompt in the line editor.  This is on by default
              as multi-line editing is only possible if the editor knows where the start of the line appears.

       <b>PROMPT_SP</b> &lt;D&gt;
              Attempt to preserve a partial line (i.e. a line that did  not  end  with  a  newline)  that  would
              otherwise  be  covered  up  by  the  command  prompt  due  to the <b>PROMPT_CR</b> option.  This works by
              outputting some cursor-control characters, including a series of  spaces,  that  should  make  the
              terminal  wrap  to the next line when a partial line is present (note that this is only successful
              if your terminal has automatic margins, which is typical).

              When a partial line is preserved, by default you will see an inverse+bold character at the end  of
              the  partial  line:   a  `<b>%</b>'  for  a  normal  user or a `<b>#</b>' for root.  If set, the shell parameter
              <b>PROMPT_EOL_MARK</b> can be used to customize how the end of partial lines are shown.

              NOTE: if the <b>PROMPT_CR</b> option is not set, enabling this option will have no effect.   This  option
              is on by default.

       <b>PROMPT_PERCENT</b> &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
              If  set,  `<b>%</b>'  is  treated  specially  in  prompt expansion.  See EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in
              <u><a href="../man1/zshmisc.1.html">zshmisc</a></u>(1).

       <b>PROMPT_SUBST</b> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              If set, <u>parameter</u> <u>expansion</u>, <u>command</u>  <u>substitution</u>  and  <u>arithmetic</u>  <u>expansion</u>  are  performed  in
              prompts.  Substitutions within prompts do not affect the command status.

       <b>TRANSIENT_RPROMPT</b>
              Remove  any  right  prompt  from  display  when accepting a command line.  This may be useful with
              terminals with other cut/paste methods.

   <b>Scripts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Functions</b>
       <b>ALIAS_FUNC_DEF</b> &lt;S&gt;
              By default, zsh does not allow the definition of functions using the `<u>name</u> <b>()</b>' syntax if <u>name</u>  was
              expanded  as  an alias: this causes an error.  This is usually the desired behaviour, as otherwise
              the combination of an alias and a function based on the same definition can easily cause problems.

              When this option is set, aliases can be used for defining functions.

              For example, consider the following definitions as they might occur in a startup file.

                     <b>alias</b> <b>foo=bar</b>
                     <b>foo()</b> <b>{</b>
                       <b>print</b> <b>This</b> <b>probably</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect.</b>
                     <b>}</b>

              Here, <b>foo</b> is expanded as an alias to <b>bar</b> before the <b>()</b> is encountered,  so  the  function  defined
              would  be  named  <b>bar</b>.  By default this is instead an error in native mode.  Note that quoting any
              part of the function name, or using the keyword <b>function</b>, avoids the problem,  so  is  recommended
              when the function name can also be an alias.

       <b>C_BASES</b>
              Output  hexadecimal  numbers  in  the  standard  C format, for example `<b>0xFF</b>' instead of the usual
              `<b>16#FF</b>'.  If the option <b>OCTAL_ZEROES</b> is also set (it is not by default),  octal  numbers  will  be
              treated  similarly  and hence appear as `<b>077</b>' instead of `<b>8#77</b>'.  This option has no effect on the
              choice of the output base, nor on the output of bases other than hexadecimal and octal.  Note that
              these formats will be understood on input irrespective of the setting of <b>C_BASES</b>.

       <b>C_PRECEDENCES</b>
              This alters the precedence of arithmetic operators  to  be  more  like  C  and  other  programming
              languages; the section ARITHMETIC EVALUATION in <u><a href="../man1/zshmisc.1.html">zshmisc</a></u>(1) has an explicit list.

       <b>DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD</b> &lt;D&gt;
              Run  the  <b>DEBUG</b>  trap  before  each command; otherwise it is run after each command.  Setting this
              option mimics the behaviour of ksh 93; with the option unset the behaviour is that of ksh 88.

       <b>ERR_EXIT</b> (<b>-e</b>, ksh: <b>-e</b>)
              If a command has a non-zero exit status, execute the  <b>ZERR</b>  trap,  if  set,  and  exit.   This  is
              disabled while running initialization scripts.

              The  behaviour is also disabled inside <b>DEBUG</b> traps.  In this case the option is handled specially:
              it is unset on entry to the trap.  If the option <b>DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD</b> is set, as it is by default, and
              the option <b>ERR_EXIT</b> is found to have been set on exit, then the command for which the  <b>DEBUG</b>  trap
              is being executed is skipped.  The option is restored after the trap exits.

              Non-zero  status  in  a command list containing <b>&amp;&amp;</b> or <b>||</b> is ignored for commands not at the end of
              the list.  Hence

                     <b>false</b> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>true</b>

              does not trigger exit.

              Exiting due to <b>ERR_EXIT</b> has certain interactions with asynchronous jobs noted in the section  JOBS
              in <u><a href="../man1/zshmisc.1.html">zshmisc</a></u>(1).

       <b>ERR_RETURN</b>
              If  a  command  has  a  non-zero exit status, return immediately from the enclosing function.  The
              logic is similar to that for <b>ERR_EXIT</b>, except  that  an  implicit  <b>return</b>  statement  is  executed
              instead of an <b>exit</b>.  This will trigger an exit at the outermost level of a non-interactive script.

              Normally  this  option inherits the behaviour of <b>ERR_EXIT</b> that code followed by `<b>&amp;&amp;</b>' `<b>||</b>' does not
              trigger a return.  Hence in the following:

                     <b>summit</b> <b>||</b> <b>true</b>

              no return is forced as the combined effect always has a zero return status.

              Note. however, that if <b>summit</b> in the above example  is  itself  a  function,  code  inside  it  is
              considered  separately:  it may force a return from <b>summit</b> (assuming the option remains set within
              <b>summit</b>), but not from the enclosing context.  This behaviour is different from <b>ERR_EXIT</b>  which  is
              unaffected by function scope.

       <b>EVAL_LINENO</b> &lt;Z&gt;
              If set, line numbers of expressions evaluated using the builtin <b>eval</b> are tracked separately of the
              enclosing  environment.   This  applies both to the parameter <b>LINENO</b> and the line number output by
              the prompt escape <b>%i</b>.  If the option is set, the prompt escape <b>%N</b> will output the string  `<b>(eval)</b>'
              instead  of  the script or function name as an indication.   (The two prompt escapes are typically
              used in the parameter <b>PS4</b> to be output when the option <b>XTRACE</b> is set.)  If <b>EVAL_LINENO</b>  is  unset,
              the line number of the surrounding script or function is retained during the evaluation.

       <b>EXEC</b> (<b>+n</b>, ksh: <b>+n</b>) &lt;D&gt;
              Do  execute  commands.   Without this option, commands are read and checked for syntax errors, but
              not executed.  This option cannot be turned off in an  interactive  shell,  except  when  `<b>-n</b>'  is
              supplied to the shell at startup.

       <b>FUNCTION_ARGZERO</b> &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
              When  executing  a  shell  function  or  sourcing  a script, set <b>$0</b> temporarily to the name of the
              function/script.  Note that toggling <b>FUNCTION_ARGZERO</b> from on to off  (or  off  to  on)  does  not
              change  the  current  value  of  <b>$0</b>.   Only  the state upon entry to the function or script has an
              effect.  Compare <b>POSIX_ARGZERO</b>.

       <b>LOCAL_LOOPS</b>
              When this option is not set, the effect of <b>break</b>  and  <b>continue</b>  commands  may  propagate  outside
              function  scope,  affecting  loops  in  calling  functions.   When  the option is set in a calling
              function, a <b>break</b> or a <b>continue</b> that is not caught within a called  function  (regardless  of  the
              setting of the option within that function) produces a warning and the effect is cancelled.

       <b>LOCAL_OPTIONS</b> &lt;K&gt;
              If  this  option is set at the point of return from a shell function, most options (including this
              one) which were in force upon entry to the function are restored; options that  are  not  restored
              are  <b>PRIVILEGED</b>  and  <b>RESTRICTED</b>.   Otherwise,  only  this option, and the <b>LOCAL_LOOPS</b>, <b>XTRACE</b> and
              <b>PRINT_EXIT_VALUE</b> options are restored.  Hence if this is explicitly unset by a shell function  the
              other options in force at the point of return will remain so.  A shell function can also guarantee
              itself  a  known  shell  configuration  with a formulation like `<b>emulate</b> <b>-L</b> <b>zsh</b>'; the <b>-L</b> activates
              <b>LOCAL_OPTIONS</b>.

       <b>LOCAL_PATTERNS</b>
              If this option is set at the point of return from a shell function, the state of pattern disables,
              as set with the builtin command `<b>disable</b> <b>-p</b>', is restored to what it was  when  the  function  was
              entered.  The behaviour of this option is similar to the effect of <b>LOCAL_OPTIONS</b> on options; hence
              `<b>emulate</b> <b>-L</b> <b>sh</b>' (or indeed any other emulation with the <b>-L</b> option) activates <b>LOCAL_PATTERNS</b>.

       <b>LOCAL_TRAPS</b> &lt;K&gt;
              If this option is set when a signal trap is set inside a function, then the previous status of the
              trap  for that signal will be restored when the function exits.  Note that this option must be set
              <u>prior</u> to altering the trap behaviour in a function; unlike <b>LOCAL_OPTIONS</b>, the value on  exit  from
              the  function  is irrelevant.  However, it does not need to be set before any global trap for that
              to be correctly restored by a function.  For example,

                     <b>unsetopt</b> <b>localtraps</b>
                     <b>trap</b> <b>-</b> <b>INT</b>
                     <b>fn()</b> <b>{</b> <b>setopt</b> <b>localtraps;</b> <b>trap</b> <b>''</b> <b>INT;</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>3;</b> <b>}</b>

              will restore normal handling of <b>SIGINT</b> after the function exits.

       <b>MULTI_FUNC_DEF</b> &lt;Z&gt;
              Allow definitions of multiple functions at once in the form `<b>fn1</b> <b>fn2</b><u>...</u><b>()</b>'; if the option  is  not
              set,  this  causes  a  parse error.  Definition of multiple functions with the <b>function</b> keyword is
              always allowed.  Multiple function definitions are not often used and can cause obscure errors.

       <b>MULTIOS</b> &lt;Z&gt;
              Perform implicit  <b>tee</b>s  or  <b>cat</b>s  when  multiple  redirections  are  attempted  (see  the  section
              `Redirection').

       <b>OCTAL_ZEROES</b> &lt;S&gt;
              Interpret  any  integer  constant  beginning  with  a  0  as  octal, per IEEE Std 1003.2-1992 (ISO
              9945-2:1993).  This is not enabled by default as it causes problems with parsing of, for  example,
              date and time strings with leading zeroes.

              Sequences  of  digits  indicating  a numeric base such as the `<b>08</b>' component in `<b>08#77</b>' are always
              interpreted as decimal, regardless of leading zeroes.

       <b>PIPE_FAIL</b>
              By default, when a pipeline exits the exit status recorded by the shell and returned by the  shell
              variable <b>$?</b> reflects that of the rightmost element of a pipeline.  If this option is set, the exit
              status  instead reflects the status of the rightmost element of the pipeline that was non-zero, or
              zero if all elements exited with zero status.

       <b>SOURCE_TRACE</b>
              If set, zsh will print an informational message announcing the name of each file  it  loads.   The
              format  of the output is similar to that for the <b>XTRACE</b> option, with the message <b>&lt;sourcetrace&gt;</b>.  A
              file may be loaded by the shell itself when it starts up and shuts down  (<b>Startup/Shutdown</b>  <b>Files</b>)
              or by the use of the `<b>source</b>' and `<b>dot</b>' builtin commands.

       <b>TYPESET_SILENT</b>
              If  this is unset, executing any of the `<b>typeset</b>' family of commands with no options and a list of
              parameters that have no values to be assigned but already exist will  display  the  value  of  the
              parameter.   If  the  option is set, they will only be shown when parameters are selected with the
              `<b>-m</b>' option.  The option `<b>-p</b>' is available whether or not the option is set.

       <b>TYPESET_TO_UNSET</b> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              When declaring a new parameter with any of the `<b>typeset</b>' family of related commands, the parameter
              remains unset unless and until a value is explicitly assigned  to  it,  either  in  the  `<b>typeset</b>'
              command itself or as a later assignment statement.

       <b>VERBOSE</b> (<b>-v</b>, ksh: <b>-v</b>)
              Print shell input lines as they are read.

       <b>XTRACE</b> (<b>-x</b>, ksh: <b>-x</b>)
              Print  commands  and their arguments as they are executed.  The output is preceded by the value of
              <b>$PS4</b>, formatted as described in the section EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in <u><a href="../man1/zshmisc.1.html">zshmisc</a></u>(1).

   <b>Shell</b> <b>Emulation</b>
       <b>APPEND_CREATE</b> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              This option only applies when <b>NO_CLOBBER</b> (-<b>C</b>) is in effect.

              If this option is not set, the shell will report an error when a append redirection (<b>&gt;&gt;</b>)  is  used
              on  a  file  that  does  not already exists (the traditional zsh behaviour of <b>NO_CLOBBER</b>).  If the
              option is set, no error is reported (POSIX behaviour).

       <b>BASH_REMATCH</b>
              When set, matches performed with the <b>=~</b> operator will set the <b>BASH_REMATCH</b> array variable, instead
              of the default <b>MATCH</b> and <b>match</b> variables.  The  first  element  of  the  <b>BASH_REMATCH</b>  array  will
              contain  the  entire matched text and subsequent elements will contain extracted substrings.  This
              option makes more sense when <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> is also set, so that the entire matched portion is  stored
              at  index  0  and  the  first  substring  is  at index 1.  Without this option, the <b>MATCH</b> variable
              contains the entire matched text and the <b>match</b> array variable contains substrings.

       <b>BSD_ECHO</b> &lt;S&gt;
              Make the <b>echo</b> builtin compatible with the BSD <u><a href="../man1/echo.1.html">echo</a></u>(1) command.  This disables  backslashed  escape
              sequences in echo strings unless the <b>-e</b> option is specified.

       <b>CONTINUE_ON_ERROR</b>
              If a fatal error is encountered (see the section ERRORS in <u><a href="../man1/zshmisc.1.html">zshmisc</a></u>(1)), and the code is running in
              a script, the shell will resume execution at the next statement in the script at the top level, in
              other  words  outside all functions or shell constructs such as loops and conditions.  This mimics
              the behaviour of interactive shells, where the shell returns to the line  editor  to  read  a  new
              command; it was the normal behaviour in versions of zsh before 5.0.1.

       <b>CSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY</b> &lt;C&gt;
              A history reference without an event specifier will always refer to the previous command.  Without
              this  option,  such a history reference refers to the same event as the previous history reference
              on the current command line, defaulting to the previous command.

       <b>CSH_JUNKIE_LOOPS</b> &lt;C&gt;
              Allow loop bodies to take the form `<u>list</u><b>;</b> <b>end</b>' instead of `<b>do</b> <u>list</u><b>;</b> <b>done</b>'.

       <b>CSH_JUNKIE_QUOTES</b> &lt;C&gt;
              Changes the rules for single- and double-quoted text to match that of  <b>csh</b>.   These  require  that
              embedded  newlines be preceded by a backslash; unescaped newlines will cause an error message.  In
              double-quoted strings, it is made impossible to escape `<b>$</b>', `<b>`</b>' or `<b>"</b>' (and `<b>\</b>' itself  no  longer
              needs escaping).  Command substitutions are only expanded once, and cannot be nested.

       <b>CSH_NULLCMD</b> &lt;C&gt;
              Do  not use the values of <b>NULLCMD</b> and <b>READNULLCMD</b> when running redirections with no command.  This
              make such redirections fail (see the section `Redirection').

       <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              Emulate <b>ksh</b> array handling as closely as possible.  If this option  is  set,  array  elements  are
              numbered  from  zero,  an array parameter without subscript refers to the first element instead of
              the whole array, and braces are required to delimit a subscript  (`<b>${path[2]}</b>'  rather  than  just
              `<b>$path[2]</b>') or to apply modifiers to any parameter (`<b>${PWD:h}</b>' rather than `<b>$PWD:h</b>').

       <b>KSH_AUTOLOAD</b> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              Emulate   <b>ksh</b>  function  autoloading.   This  means  that  when  a  function  is  autoloaded,  the
              corresponding file is merely executed, and must define the  function  itself.   (By  default,  the
              function is defined to the contents of the file.  However, the most common <b>ksh</b>-style case - of the
              file containing only a simple definition of the function - is always handled in the <b>ksh</b>-compatible
              manner.)

       <b>KSH_OPTION_PRINT</b> &lt;K&gt;
              Alters  the  way options settings are printed: instead of separate lists of set and unset options,
              all options are shown, marked `on' if they are in the non-default state, `off' otherwise.

       <b>KSH_TYPESET</b>
              This option is now obsolete: a better appropximation to the behaviour of other shells is  obtained
              with  the reserved word interface to <b>declare</b>, <b>export</b>, <b>float</b>, <b>integer</b>, <b>local</b>, <b>readonly</b> and <b>typeset</b>.
              Note that the option is only applied when the reserved word interface is <u>not</u> in use.

              Alters the way arguments to the <b>typeset</b> family of  commands,  including  <b>declare</b>,  <b>export</b>,  <b>float</b>,
              <b>integer</b>,  <b>local</b>  and  <b>readonly</b>,  are processed.  Without this option, zsh will perform normal word
              splitting after command and parameter expansion in arguments  of  an  assignment;  with  it,  word
              splitting does not take place in those cases.

       <b>KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT</b>
              Treat  use of a subscript of value zero in array or string expressions as a reference to the first
              element, i.e. the element that usually has the subscript 1.  Ignored if <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> is also set.

              If neither this option nor <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> is set, accesses to an element of an array  or  string  with
              subscript  zero  return an empty element or string, while attempts to set element zero of an array
              or string are treated as an error.  However, attempts to set an otherwise  valid  subscript  range
              that includes zero will succeed.  For example, if <b>KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT</b> is not set,

                     <b>array[0]=(element)</b>

              is an error, while

                     <b>array[0,1]=(element)</b>

              is not and will replace the first element of the array.

              This  option  is  for compatibility with older versions of the shell and is not recommended in new
              code.

       <b>POSIX_ALIASES</b> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              When this option is set, reserved words are not candidates  for  alias  expansion:   it  is  still
              possible to declare any of them as an alias, but the alias will never be expanded.  Reserved words
              are described in the section RESERVED WORDS in <u><a href="../man1/zshmisc.1.html">zshmisc</a></u>(1).

              Alias  expansion  takes  place while text is being read; hence when this option is set it does not
              take effect until the end of any function or other piece of shell code parsed as one  unit.   Note
              this may cause differences from other shells even when the option is in effect.  For example, when
              running  a command with `<b>zsh</b> <b>-c</b>', or even `<b>zsh</b> <b>-o</b> <b>posixaliases</b> <b>-c</b>', the entire command argument is
              parsed as one unit, so aliases defined within the argument are not available even in later  lines.
              If in doubt, avoid use of aliases in non-interactive code.

       <b>POSIX_ARGZERO</b>
              This  option  may be used to temporarily disable <b>FUNCTION_ARGZERO</b> and thereby restore the value of
              <b>$0</b> to the name used to invoke the  shell  (or  as  set  by  the  <b>-c</b>  command  line  option).   For
              compatibility  with  previous versions of the shell, emulations use <b>NO_FUNCTION_ARGZERO</b> instead of
              <b>POSIX_ARGZERO</b>, which may result in unexpected scoping of <b>$0</b>  if  the  emulation  mode  is  changed
              inside  a  function  or  script.   To  avoid  this, explicitly enable <b>POSIX_ARGZERO</b> in the <b>emulate</b>
              command:

                     <b>emulate</b> <b>sh</b> <b>-o</b> <b>POSIX_ARGZERO</b>

              Note that <b>NO_POSIX_ARGZERO</b> has no effect unless <b>FUNCTION_ARGZERO</b> was already enabled upon entry to
              the function or script.

       <b>POSIX_BUILTINS</b> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              When this option is set the <b>command</b> builtin  can  be  used  to  execute  shell  builtin  commands.
              Parameter  assignments  specified  before  shell functions and special builtins are kept after the
              command completes unless the special builtin  is  prefixed  with  the  <b>command</b>  builtin.   Special
              builtins are <b>.</b>, <b>:</b>, <b>break</b>, <b>continue</b>, <b>declare</b>, <b>eval</b>, <b>exit</b>, <b>export</b>, <b>integer</b>, <b>local</b>, <b>readonly</b>, <b>return</b>,
              <b>set</b>, <b>shift</b>, <b>source</b>, <b>times</b>, <b>trap</b> and <b>unset</b>.

              In  addition,  various  error  conditions  associated  with  the  above  builtins  or <b>exec</b> cause a
              non-interactive shell to exit and an interactive shell to return to its top-level processing.

              Furthermore, functions and shell builtins are not executed after an <b>exec</b> prefix; the command to be
              executed must be an external command found in the path.

              Furthermore, the <b>getopts</b> builtin behaves in a POSIX-compatible  fashion  in  that  the  associated
              variable  <b>OPTIND</b>  is not made local to functions, and its value is calculated differently to match
              other shells.

              Moreover, the warning and special exit code from <b>[[</b> <b>-o</b> <u>non_existent_option</u> <b>]]</b> are suppressed.

       <b>POSIX_IDENTIFIERS</b> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              When this option is set, only the ASCII characters <b>a</b> to <b>z</b>, <b>A</b> to <b>Z</b>, <b>0</b> to <b>9</b> and <b>_</b>  may  be  used  in
              identifiers (names of shell parameters and modules).

              In  addition,  setting  this option limits the effect of parameter substitution with no braces, so
              that the expression <b>$#</b> is treated as the parameter <b>$#</b> even if followed by a valid parameter  name.
              When  it is unset, zsh allows expressions of the form <b>$#</b><u>name</u> to refer to the length of <b>$</b><u>name</u>, even
              for special variables, for example in expressions such as <b>$#-</b> and <b>$#*</b>.

              Another difference is that with the option set assignment  to  an  unset  variable  in  arithmetic
              context causes the variable to be created as a scalar rather than a numeric type.  So after `<b>unset</b>
              <b>t;</b> <b>((</b> <b>t</b> <b>=</b> <b>3</b> <b>))</b>'. without <b>POSIX_IDENTIFIERS</b> set <b>t</b> has integer type, while with it set it has scalar
              type.

              When  the  option  is unset and multibyte character support is enabled (i.e. it is compiled in and
              the option <b>MULTIBYTE</b> is set), then additionally any alphanumeric characters in the local character
              set may be used in identifiers.  Note that scripts and functions written with this feature are not
              portable, and also that both options must be set before the script or function is parsed;  setting
              them  during execution is not sufficient as the syntax <u>variable</u><b>=</b><u>value</u> has already been parsed as a
              command rather than an assignment.

              If multibyte character support is not compiled into the shell this option is ignored;  all  octets
              with  the top bit set may be used in identifiers.  This is non-standard but is the traditional zsh
              behaviour.

       <b>POSIX_STRINGS</b> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              This option affects processing of quoted strings.  Currently it only affects the behaviour of null
              characters, i.e. character 0 in the portable character set corresponding to US ASCII.

              When this option is not set, null characters embedded  within  strings  of  the  form  <b>$'</b><u>...</u><b>'</b>  are
              treated  as  ordinary  characters.  The entire string is maintained within the shell and output to
              files where necessary, although owing to restrictions of  the  library  interface  the  string  is
              truncated  at the null character in file names, environment variables, or in arguments to external
              programs.

              When this option is set, the <b>$'</b><u>...</u><b>'</b> expression is truncated at  the  null  character.   Note  that
              remaining parts of the same string beyond the termination of the quotes are not truncated.

              For  example, the command line argument <b>a$'b\0c'd</b> is treated with the option off as the characters
              <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, null, <b>c</b>, <b>d</b>, and with the option on as the characters <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>d</b>.

       <b>POSIX_TRAPS</b> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              When this option is set, the usual zsh behaviour of executing traps for <b>EXIT</b> on  exit  from  shell
              functions  is suppressed.  In that case, manipulating <b>EXIT</b> traps always alters the global trap for
              exiting the shell; the <b>LOCAL_TRAPS</b> option is ignored for the <b>EXIT</b> trap.

              Also, a <b>return</b> statement executed in a trap with no argument passes back  from  the  function  the
              value from the surrounding context, not from code executed within the trap.

              Furthermore,  if  a  trap  is  set  to be ignored, this state persists when a subshell is entered.
              Without the option, the trap would be reset to its default state at this point.

       <b>SH_FILE_EXPANSION</b> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              Perform filename expansion (e.g., <b>~</b> expansion) <u>before</u> parameter expansion,  command  substitution,
              arithmetic  expansion  and  brace expansion.  If this option is unset, it is performed <u>after</u> brace
              expansion, so things like `<b>~$USERNAME</b>' and `<b>~{pfalstad,rc}</b>' will work.

       <b>SH_NULLCMD</b> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              Do not use the values of <b>NULLCMD</b> and <b>READNULLCMD</b> when doing redirections, use `<b>:</b>' instead (see the
              section `Redirection').

       <b>SH_OPTION_LETTERS</b> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              If this option is set the shell tries to interpret single letter options (which are used with  <b>set</b>
              and <b>setopt</b>) like <b>ksh</b> does.  This also affects the value of the <b>-</b> special parameter.

       <b>SH_WORD_SPLIT</b> (<b>-y</b>) &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;
              Causes  field  splitting  to be performed on unquoted parameter expansions.  Note that this option
              has nothing to do with word splitting.  (See <u><a href="../man1/zshexpn.1.html">zshexpn</a></u>(1).)

       <b>TRAPS_ASYNC</b>
              While waiting for a program to exit, handle signals and run traps immediately.  Otherwise the trap
              is run after a child process has exited.  Note this does not affect the point at which  traps  are
              run for any case other than when the shell is waiting for a child process.

   <b>Shell</b> <b>State</b>
       <b>INTERACTIVE</b> (<b>-i</b>, ksh: <b>-i</b>)
              This  is  an interactive shell.  This option is set upon initialisation if the standard input is a
              tty and commands are being read from standard input.  (See the discussion  of  <b>SHIN_STDIN</b>.)   This
              heuristic  may be overridden by specifying a state for this option on the command line.  The value
              of this option can only be changed via flags supplied at invocation of the shell.   It  cannot  be
              changed once zsh is running.

       <b>LOGIN</b> (<b>-l</b>, ksh: <b>-l</b>)
              This  is  a login shell.  If this option is not explicitly set, the shell becomes a login shell if
              the first character of the <b>argv[0]</b> passed to the shell is a `<b>-</b>'.

       <b>PRIVILEGED</b> (<b>-p</b>, ksh: <b>-p</b>)
              Turn on privileged mode. Typically this is used when script is to be run with elevated privileges.
              This should be done as follows directly with the <b>-p</b> option to zsh so that it takes  effect  during
              startup.

                     <b>#!/bin/zsh</b> <b>-p</b>

              The  option  is  enabled automatically on startup if the effective user (group) ID is not equal to
              the real user (group) ID. In this case, turning the option off causes the effective user and group
              IDs to be set to the real user and group IDs. Be aware that if that fails the shell may be running
              with different IDs than was intended so a script should check for failure and act accordingly, for
              example:

                     <b>unsetopt</b> <b>privileged</b> <b>||</b> <b>exit</b>

              The <b>PRIVILEGED</b> option disables sourcing user startup files.  If zsh is invoked as  `<b>sh</b>'  or  `<b>ksh</b>'
              with  this  option  set,  <b>/etc/suid_profile</b> is sourced (after <b><a href="file:/etc/profile">/etc/profile</a></b> on interactive shells).
              Sourcing <b><a href="file:~/.profile">~/.profile</a></b> is disabled and the contents of the  <b>ENV</b>  variable  is  ignored.  This  option
              cannot  be  changed  using the <b>-m</b> option of <b>setopt</b> and <b>unsetopt</b>, and changing it inside a function
              always changes it globally regardless of the <b>LOCAL_OPTIONS</b> option.

       <b>RESTRICTED</b> (<b>-r</b>)
              Enables restricted mode.  This option cannot be changed using <b>unsetopt</b>, and setting  it  inside  a
              function  always  changes  it  globally  regardless  of the <b>LOCAL_OPTIONS</b> option.  See the section
              `Restricted Shell'.

       <b>SHIN_STDIN</b> (<b>-s</b>, ksh: <b>-s</b>)
              Commands are being read from the standard input.  Commands are read  from  standard  input  if  no
              command  is  specified  with  <b>-c</b>  and  no  file  of  commands  is specified.  If <b>SHIN_STDIN</b> is set
              explicitly on the command line, any argument that would otherwise have been taken as a file to run
              will instead be treated as a normal positional parameter.  Note that  setting  or  unsetting  this
              option  on  the  command line does not necessarily affect the state the option will have while the
              shell is running - that is purely an indicator of whether or not commands are <u>actually</u> being  read
              from  standard  input.   The  value  of  this  option  can  only  be changed via flags supplied at
              invocation of the shell.  It cannot be changed once zsh is running.

       <b>SINGLE_COMMAND</b> (<b>-t</b>, ksh: <b>-t</b>)
              If the shell is reading from standard input, it exits after a single command  has  been  executed.
              This  also makes the shell non-interactive, unless the <b>INTERACTIVE</b> option is explicitly set on the
              command line.  The value of this option can only be changed via flags supplied  at  invocation  of
              the shell.  It cannot be changed once zsh is running.

   <b>Zle</b>
       <b>BEEP</b> (<b>+B</b>) &lt;D&gt;
              Beep on error in ZLE.

       <b>COMBINING_CHARS</b>
              Assume  that  the  terminal  displays  combining  characters  correctly.   Specifically, if a base
              alphanumeric character is followed by one or more zero-width punctuation characters,  assume  that
              the zero-width characters will be displayed as modifications to the base character within the same
              width.   Not  all  terminals  handle  this.   If this option is not set, zero-width characters are
              displayed separately with special mark-up.

              If this option is set, the pattern test <b>[[:WORD:]]</b> matches a zero-width punctuation  character  on
              the  assumption  that  it  will  be  used  as part of a word in combination with a word character.
              Otherwise the base shell does not handle combining characters specially.

       <b>EMACS</b>  If ZLE is loaded, turning on this option has the equivalent effect of `<b>bindkey</b> <b>-e</b>'.  In  addition,
              the  VI  option  is unset.  Turning it off has no effect.  The option setting is not guaranteed to
              reflect the current keymap.  This option is provided for compatibility; <b>bindkey</b> is the recommended
              interface.

       <b>OVERSTRIKE</b>
              Start up the line editor in overstrike mode.

       <b>SINGLE_LINE_ZLE</b> (<b>-M</b>) &lt;K&gt;
              Use single-line command line editing instead of multi-line.

              Note that although  this  is  on  by  default  in  ksh  emulation  it  only  provides  superficial
              compatibility  with  the ksh line editor and reduces the effectiveness of the zsh line editor.  As
              it has no effect on shell syntax, many users may wish  to  disable  this  option  when  using  ksh
              emulation interactively.

       <b>VI</b>     If  ZLE is loaded, turning on this option has the equivalent effect of `<b>bindkey</b> <b>-v</b>'.  In addition,
              the EMACS option is unset.  Turning it off has no effect.  The option setting is not guaranteed to
              reflect the current keymap.  This option is provided for compatibility; <b>bindkey</b> is the recommended
              interface.

       <b>ZLE</b> (<b>-Z</b>)
              Use the zsh line editor.  Set by default in interactive shells connected to a terminal.

</pre><h4><b>OPTION</b> <b>ALIASES</b></h4><pre>
       Some options have alternative names.  These aliases are never used for output, but can be used just  like
       normal option names when specifying options to the shell.
