</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       openssl-namedisplay-options - Distinguished name display options

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>openssl</b> <u>command</u> [ <u>options</u> ... ] [ <u>parameters</u> ... ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       OpenSSL provides fine-grain control over how the subject and issuer DN's are displayed.  This is
       specified by using the <b>-nameopt</b> option, which takes a comma-separated list of options from the following
       set.  An option may be preceded by a minus sign, "-", to turn it off.  The first four option arguments
       are the most commonly used.

       The default value is "esc_ctrl,utf8,dump_unknown,dump_der,sep_comma_plus_space,sname".

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Name</b> <b>Format</b> <b>Option</b> <b>Arguments</b>
       The DN output format can be fine tuned with the following flags.

       <b>compat</b>
           Display the name using an old format from previous OpenSSL versions.

       <b>RFC2253</b>
           Display  the  name  using  the  format  defined in RFC 2253.  It is equivalent to <b>esc_2253</b>, <b>esc_ctrl</b>,
           <b>esc_msb</b>, <b>utf8</b>, <b>dump_nostr</b>, <b>dump_unknown</b>, <b>dump_der</b>, <b>sep_comma_plus</b>, <b>dn_rev</b> and <b>sname</b>.

       <b>oneline</b>
           Display the name in one line, using a format that is more readable RFC 2253.   It  is  equivalent  to
           <b>esc_2253</b>,  <b>esc_ctrl</b>,  <b>esc_msb</b>,  <b>utf8</b>, <b>dump_nostr</b>, <b>dump_der</b>, <b>use_quote</b>, <b>sep_comma_plus_space</b>, <b>space_eq</b>
           and <b>sname</b> options.

       <b>multiline</b>
           Display the name using multiple  lines.   It  is  equivalent  to  <b>esc_ctrl</b>,  <b>esc_msb</b>,  <b>sep_multiline</b>,
           <b>space_eq</b>, <b>lname</b> and <b>align</b>.

       <b>esc_2253</b>
           Escape  the "special" characters in a field, as required by RFC 2253.  That is, any of the characters
           ",+"&lt;&gt;;", "#" at the beginning of a string and leading or trailing spaces.

       <b>esc_2254</b>
           Escape the "special" characters in a field as required by RFC 2254 in a  field.   That  is,  the  <b>NUL</b>
           character and of "()*".

       <b>esc_ctrl</b>
           Escape  non-printable  ASCII  characters, codes less than 0x20 (space) or greater than 0x7F (DELETE).
           They are displayed using RFC 2253 "\XX" notation where <b>XX</b> are the two  hex  digits  representing  the
           character value.

       <b>esc_msb</b>
           Escape  any  characters  with  the  most significant bit set, that is with values larger than 127, as
           described in <b>esc_ctrl</b>.

       <b>use_quote</b>
           Escapes some characters by surrounding the entire string with quotation  marks,  """.   Without  this
           option, individual special characters are preceded with a backslash character, "\".

       <b>utf8</b>
           Convert  all  strings  to  UTF-8 format first as required by RFC 2253.  If the output device is UTF-8
           compatible, then using this option (and  not  setting  <b>esc_msb</b>)  may  give  the  correct  display  of
           multibyte  characters.  If this option is not set, then multibyte characters larger than 0xFF will be
           output as "\UXXXX" for 16 bits or "\WXXXXXXXX" for 32 bits.  In addition,  any  UTF8Strings  will  be
           converted to their character form first.

       <b>ignore_type</b>
           This  option  does  not  attempt  to  interpret multibyte characters in any way. That is, the content
           octets are merely dumped as though one octet represents each character. This is useful for diagnostic
           purposes but will result in rather odd looking output.

       <b>show_type</b>
           Display the type of the ASN1 character string before the value, such as "BMPSTRING: Hello World".

       <b>dump_der</b>
           Any fields that would be output in hex format are displayed using the DER encoding of the field.   If
           not set, just the content octets are displayed.  Either way, the <b>#XXXX...</b> format of RFC 2253 is used.

       <b>dump_nostr</b>
           Dump  non-character  strings,  such  as  ASN.1  <b>OCTET</b>  <b>STRING</b>.   If  this option is not set, then non
           character string types will be displayed as though each content octet represents a single character.

       <b>dump_all</b>
           Dump all fields. When this used with <b>dump_der</b>, this allows the DER encoding of the  structure  to  be
           unambiguously determined.

       <b>dump_unknown</b>
           Dump any field whose OID is not recognised by OpenSSL.

       <b>sep_comma_plus</b>, <b>sep_comma_plus_space</b>, <b>sep_semi_plus_space</b>, <b>sep_multiline</b>
           Specify  the field separators. The first word is used between the Relative Distinguished Names (RDNs)
           and the second is between multiple Attribute Value Assertions (AVAs). Multiple AVAs are very rare and
           their use is discouraged.  The options ending  in  "space"  additionally  place  a  space  after  the
           separator  to  make  it more readable.  The <b>sep_multiline</b> starts each field on its own line, and uses
           "plus space" for the AVA separator.  It also indents the fields  by  four  characters.   The  default
           value is <b>sep_comma_plus_space</b>.

       <b>dn_rev</b>
           Reverse  the fields of the DN as required by RFC 2253.  This also reverses the order of multiple AVAs
           in a field, but this is permissible as there is no ordering on values.

       <b>nofname</b>, <b>sname</b>, <b>lname</b>, <b>oid</b>
           Specify how the field name is displayed.  <b>nofname</b> does not display the field at all.  <b>sname</b> uses  the
           "short name" form (CN for commonName for example).  <b>lname</b> uses the long form.  <b>oid</b> represents the OID
           in numerical form and is useful for diagnostic purpose.

       <b>align</b>
           Align field values for a more readable output. Only usable with <b>sep_multiline</b>.

       <b>space_eq</b>
           Places spaces round the equal sign, "=", character which follows the field name.
