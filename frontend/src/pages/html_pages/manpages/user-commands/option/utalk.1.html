</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       utalk - a UDP-based full screen talk program

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>utalk</b> [options] user[@host][#tty]
       <b>utalk</b> [options] !port@host
       <b>utalk</b> [options] -s port
       <b>utalk</b> [options] -c host port

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-s,</b> <b>--server</b>
              Tells  <b>utalk</b>  not to use the talk daemons to announce itself, and instead wait for a connection on
              the given port number.

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--client</b>
              Tells <b>utalk</b> not to use the talk daemons to announce itself, and instead connect to the given  port
              number on the given host.

       <b>-a,</b> <b>--announce-only</b>
              Makes  <b>utalk</b>  decide on a local port number, and send out an announce with the port number instead
              of your username.  Useful to start a <b>utalk</b> session with a host that has a talk daemon  when  yours
              doesn't.

       <b>-7,</b> <b>--seven-bit</b>
              Makes  <b>utalk</b>  convert all characters to 7-bit US-ASCII before displaying them; useful if you don't
              have an iso-8859-1 capable terminal.

       <b>-8,</b> <b>--eight-bit</b>
              Makes <b>utalk</b> show iso-8859-1 encoded characters on the screen, as they are received.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>user@host[#tty]</b>
              Specifies the user to ring.  The "user@host" part can be replaced with an alias  name  defined  in
              your  <b><a href="file:~/.utalkrc.">~/.utalkrc.</a></b>  If you specify the tty, <b>utalk</b> will ask the talk daemon to ring the user on that
              particular tty.  The username can be prefixed by a '!', which <b>utalk</b> will strip.

       <b>!port@host</b>
              Specifies the port number to connect to, and the host.  Useful to answer to a <b>utalk</b> <b>-a</b>.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>utalk</b> is a text-based chat program in the vein of <b>talk</b> and <b>YTalk</b>, which uses a better protocol built over
       UDP for communication.  Because it does not require that network packets arrive in sequence to be able to
       display them, <b>utalk</b> can be used over unreliable links where a TCP/IP connection such as  a  telnet  or  a
       talk would be too slow to be usable.

       Additionally,  <b>utalk</b>  supports  full editing of previously typed text, scrollback, keyboard bindings, and
       aliases.

       <b>utalk</b> is <u>incompatible</u> with any  other  talk  programs,  as  it  uses  a  completely  different  protocol.
       Unfortunately,  the text "respond with:  talk" is hard-coded in the talk daemon, and cannot be set by the
       client.

       To avoid confusion, <b>utalk's</b> talk requests send the username prefixed with a '!', which must be understood
       as ``respond with <b>utalk</b>''.

</pre><h4><b>DISPLAY</b></h4><pre>
       As in <b>talk</b> and <b>YTalk</b>, the <b>utalk</b> screen is divided in two separate scrolling areas or windows, at the  top
       one for yourself and at the bottom one for the other connected user.

       At  any time, one of these windows is active.  Each scrolling area has a status line at the top, with the
       name of the client and the following flags:

       <b>[m]</b>    This flag is always present on the top window that it's your own window, from your point  of  view
              it means it's "<b>m</b>y" window.

       <b>[o]</b>    This flag means that your own window is in <b>o</b>verwrite mode.

       <b>[i]</b>    This flag means that your own window is in <b>i</b>nsert mode.

       <b>[*]</b>    This  flag  means  that  the window is active and in read-write mode.  This is the normal mode for
              your own window;  in this mode, you can type and edit, and when you move your cursor and/or scroll
              back, the other connected user can see the cursor movement too.

       <b>[R]</b>    This flag means that the window is active and in read-only mode.  This is  the  only  way  another
              window  than  yours can be active (i.e you can't type text in someone else's window); setting your
              own window in read-only mode lets you scroll back through what you typed without  the  other  user
              seeing you doing it.

       <b>[n]</b>    Means that the window is not yet connected; the user hasn't responded yet.

       <b>[c]</b>    Means that the window is connected.

       <b>[b]</b>    Means  that the window is connected, but no data (even control data that <b>utalk</b> sends periodically)
              has been received for a while, so the connection might be broken or the client on the  other  side
              might have crashed.  <b>utalk</b> will not interrupt a connection because of this, it's up to you to stop
              it after a while if it doesn't come back.

</pre><h4><b>EDITING</b></h4><pre>
       <b>utalk</b>'s  editing  keys  can  be  configured to emulate either <b>vi</b> or <b>emacs</b>, in a limited way.  By default,
       <b>utalk</b> is in emacs mode.

       <b>utalk</b> keeps a table of bindings for each of three modes: emacs mode, vi command mode, and vi insert mode.
       These tables are initialized to suitable defaults, and you can add bindings with the <u>bind</u> command in your
       <a href="file:~/.utalkrc">~/.utalkrc</a> file.

       The following is a list of all key commands and their default bindings in emacs mode,  vi  command  mode,
       and vi insert/replace mode respectively.

       <b>self-insert</b> <b>(printable</b> <b>chars)</b> <b>(unbound)</b> <b>(printable</b> <b>chars)</b>
              In  overwrite mode (replace in vi mode) the keypress gets inserted at the current cursor position,
              the character at this position is replaced by the new one, and the cursor moves forward one step.

              In insert mode the key gets inserted as well at the current cursor position but the  rest  of  the
              line (if any) is moved one step to the right.

       <b>toggle-overwrite</b> <b>(ESC</b> <b>[2~)</b> <b>(unbound)</b> <b>(unbound)</b>
              Change between overwrite and insert modes.
              In most systems the sequence <b>ESC</b> <b>[2~</b> is mapped to the insert key.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       You can specify a number of settings for <b>utalk</b> in a configuration  file  called  <u>.utalkrc</u>  in  your  home
       directory.

       Valid commands are:

           emacs-mode
           vi-mode
           bind <u>key</u> <u>function</u>
           bind! <u>key</u> <u>function</u>
           alias <u>alias</u> <u>value</u>
           set <u>setting</u> on|off

       Settings are:

       <b>beep</b>   Makes utalk let beeps through or silence them.

       <b>word-wrap,</b> <b>wordwrap,</b> <b>ww</b>
              Turns word-wrap on or off (only at the end of the last line in the buffer).

       <b>eight-bit,</b> <b>eightbit,</b> <b>eb</b>
              Lets eight-bit iso-latin-1 characters through or maps them to US-ASCII.

       <b>meta-esc,</b> <b>metaesc,</b> <b>me</b>
              Maps  keys with the high bit set to ESC followed by key, or lets them through (only affects emacs-
              mode).

       <b>overwrite</b>
              Set initial overwrite mode "on", or "off" for insert mode, that can be changed later (usually with
              insert key), this setting in fact only affects emacs-mode because  in  vi-mode  the  mode  is  set
              explicitly with "i" and "R" commands.

       "toggle" and "se" are synonyms for "set".
       "bindkey" and "bindkey!" are synonyms for "bind" and "bind!", respectively.

       In settings, "on" and "off" arguments are optional, "on" is assumed by default, unless the setting's name
       is prefixed with "no".

       Bindings  apply  to  the  current  mode;  to change bindings in vi mode, put a "vi-mode" first, then your
       "bind"s and "bind!"s.  In emacs mode, "bind" and "bind!" are synonymous.

       In a binding, the <u>key</u> must be a character or sequence of characters, not separated with any spaces.   The
       following sequences are recognized to specify characters:

           ^<u>char</u>, C-<u>char</u>     --   Control-<u>char</u>
           M-<u>char</u>            --   Meta-<u>char</u>
           \e                --   ESC
           \t                --   Tab
           \r                --   Carriage return (^M)
           \n                --   Newline (^J)
           \x<u>hex</u> <u>code</u>        --   Ascii code given in hex
           <u>char</u>              --   That char, taken literally

       Note  that  you  shouldn't  bind  functions to M-key combinations in emacs mode; use ESC key combinations
       instead, and turn meta-esc on if you want to use your Meta key like in emacs.

       You can make aliases for addresses of people to ring, in either of 3 forms:

       <b>alias</b> <u>aliasname</u>@ <u>username</u>@
                   Replaces <u>aliasname</u>@<u>host</u> with <u>username</u>@<u>host</u> for every host. The '@' at the end of <u>username@</u> is
                   not required.

       <b>alias</b> <b>@</b><u>aliashost</u> @<u>realhost</u>
                   Replaces <u>user</u>@<u>aliashost</u> with <u>user</u>@<u>realhost</u> for every  user.  The  '@'  at  the  beginning  of
                   @<u>realhost</u> is not required.

       <b>alias</b> <u>aliasname</u> <u>user</u>@<u>host</u>
                   Replaces <u>aliasname</u> with <u>user</u>@<u>host</u>.

       Currently the wordwarp function only works in overwrite mode, not in insert mode. If  the  users  have  a
       different terminal width, the wordwrap is only done correctly in the local "my" window.

       The vi and emacs emulations are relatively primitive.

       There is an embedded help function but is not completed.
