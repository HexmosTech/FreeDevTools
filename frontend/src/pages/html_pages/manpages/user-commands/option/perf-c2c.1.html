</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perf-c2c - Shared Data C2C/HITM Analyzer.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>perf</u> <u>c2c</u> <u>record</u> [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;command&gt;
       <u>perf</u> <u>c2c</u> <u>record</u> [&lt;options&gt;] -- [&lt;record command options&gt;] &lt;command&gt;
       <u>perf</u> <u>c2c</u> <u>report</u> [&lt;options&gt;]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       C2C stands for Cache To Cache.

       The perf c2c tool provides means for Shared Data C2C/HITM analysis. It allows you to track down the
       cacheline contentions.

       On Intel, the tool is based on load latency and precise store facility events provided by Intel CPUs. On
       PowerPC, the tool uses random instruction sampling with thresholding feature. On AMD, the tool uses IBS
       op pmu (due to hardware limitations, perf c2c is not supported on Zen3 cpus). On Arm64 it uses SPE to
       sample load and store operations, therefore hardware and kernel support is required. See <b><a href="../man1/perf-arm-spe.1.html">perf-arm-spe</a></b>(1)
       for a setup guide. Due to the statistical nature of Arm SPE sampling, not every memory operation will be
       sampled.

       These events provide: - memory address of the access - type of the access (load and store details) -
       latency (in cycles) of the load access

       The c2c tool provide means to record this data and report back access details for cachelines with highest
       contention - highest number of HITM accesses.

       The basic workflow with this tool follows the standard record/report phase. User uses the record command
       to record events data and report command to display it.

</pre><h4><b>RECORD</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -e, --event=
           Select the PMU event. Use <u>perf</u> <u>c2c</u> <u>record</u> <u>-e</u> <u>list</u> to list available events.

       -v, --verbose
           Be more verbose (show counter open errors, etc).

       -l, --ldlat
           Configure mem-loads latency. Supported on Intel and Arm64 processors only. Ignored on other archs.

       -k, --all-kernel
           Configure all used events to run in kernel space.

       -u, --all-user
           Configure all used events to run in user space.

</pre><h4><b>REPORT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -k, --vmlinux=&lt;file&gt;
           vmlinux pathname

       -v, --verbose
           Be more verbose (show counter open errors, etc).

       -i, --input
           Specify the input file to process.

       -N, --node-info
           Show extra node info in report (see NODE INFO section)

       -c, --coalesce
           Specify sorting fields for single cacheline display. Following fields are available:
           tid,pid,iaddr,dso (see COALESCE)

       -g, --call-graph
           Setup callchains parameters. Please refer to perf-report man page for details.

       --stdio
           Force the stdio output (see STDIO OUTPUT)

       --stats
           Display only statistic tables and force stdio mode.

       --full-symbols
           Display full length of symbols.

       --no-source
           Do not display Source:Line column.

       --show-all
           Show all captured HITM lines, with no regard to HITM % 0.0005 limit.

       -f, --force
           Don’t do ownership validation.

       -d, --display
           Switch to HITM type (rmt, lcl) or peer snooping type (peer) to display and sort on. Total HITMs (tot)
           as default, except Arm64 uses peer mode as default.

       --stitch-lbr
           Show callgraph with stitched LBRs, which may have more complete callgraph. The perf.data file must
           have been obtained using perf c2c record --call-graph lbr. Disabled by default. In common cases with
           call stack overflows, it can recreate better call stacks than the default lbr call stack output. But
           this approach is not foolproof. There can be cases where it creates incorrect call stacks from
           incorrect matches. The known limitations include exception handing such as setjmp/longjmp will have
           calls/returns not match.

       --double-cl
           Group the detection of shared cacheline events into double cacheline granularity. Some architectures
           have an Adjacent Cacheline Prefetch feature, which causes cacheline sharing to behave like the
           cacheline size is doubled.

</pre><h4><b>C2C</b> <b>RECORD</b></h4><pre>
       The perf c2c record command setup options related to HITM cacheline analysis and calls standard perf
       record command.

       Following perf record options are configured by default: (check perf record man page for details)

           -W,-d,--phys-data,--sample-cpu

       Unless specified otherwise with <u>-e</u> option, following events are monitored by default on Intel:

           cpu/mem-loads,ldlat=30/P
           cpu/mem-stores/P

       following on AMD:

           ibs_op//

       and following on PowerPC:

           cpu/mem-loads/
           cpu/mem-stores/

       User can pass any <u>perf</u> <u>record</u> option behind <u>--</u> mark, like (to enable callchains and system wide
       monitoring):

           $ perf c2c record -- -g -a

       Please check RECORD OPTIONS section for specific c2c record options.

</pre><h4><b>C2C</b> <b>REPORT</b></h4><pre>
       The perf c2c report command displays shared data analysis. It comes in two display modes: stdio and tui
       (default).

       The report command workflow is following: - sort all the data based on the cacheline address - store
       access details for each cacheline - sort all cachelines based on user settings - display data

       In general perf report output consist of 2 basic views: 1) most expensive cachelines list 2) offsets
       details for each cacheline

       For each cacheline in the 1) list we display following data: (Both stdio and TUI modes follow the same
       fields output)

           Index
           - zero based index to identify the cacheline

           Cacheline
           - cacheline address (hex number)

           Rmt/Lcl Hitm (Display with HITM types)
           - cacheline percentage of all Remote/Local HITM accesses

           - count of LLC load accesses, includes LLC hits and LLC HITMs

           RMT Load Hit - RmtHit, RmtHitm
           - count of remote load accesses, includes remote hits and remote HITMs;
             on Arm neoverse cores, RmtHit is used to account remote accesses,
             includes remote DRAM or any upward cache level in remote node

           Load Dram - Lcl, Rmt
           - count of local and remote DRAM accesses

       For each offset in the 2) list we display following data:

             - nodes participating on the access (see NODE INFO section)

</pre><h4><b>NODE</b> <b>INFO</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>Node</u> field displays nodes that accesses given cacheline offset. Its output comes in 3 flavors: - node
       IDs separated by <u>,</u> - node IDs with stats for each ID, in following format: Node{cpus %hitms %stores}
       (Display with HITM types) Node{cpus %peers %stores} (Display with peer type) - node IDs with list of
       affected CPUs in following format: Node{cpu list}

       User can switch between above flavors with -N option or use <u>n</u> key to interactively switch in TUI mode.

</pre><h4><b>COALESCE</b></h4><pre>
       User can specify how to sort offsets for cacheline.

       Following fields are available and governs the final output fields set for cacheline offsets output:

           tid   - coalesced by process TIDs
           pid   - coalesced by process PIDs
           iaddr - coalesced by code address, following fields are displayed:
                      Code address, Code symbol, Shared Object, Source line
           dso   - coalesced by shared object

       By default the coalescing is setup with <u>pid,iaddr</u>.

</pre><h4><b>STDIO</b> <b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       The stdio output displays data on standard output.

       Following tables are displayed: Trace Event Information - overall statistics of memory accesses

           Global Shared Cache Line Event Information
           - overall statistics on shared cachelines

           Shared Data Cache Line Table
           - list of most expensive cachelines

           Shared Cache Line Distribution Pareto
           - list of all accessed offsets for each cacheline

</pre><h4><b>TUI</b> <b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       The TUI output provides interactive interface to navigate through cachelines list and to display offset
       details.

       For details please refer to the help window by pressing <u>?</u> key.

</pre><h4><b>CREDITS</b></h4><pre>
       Although Don Zickus, Dick Fowles and Joe Mario worked together to get this implemented, we got lots of
       early help from Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo, Stephane Eranian, Jiri Olsa and Andi Kleen.
