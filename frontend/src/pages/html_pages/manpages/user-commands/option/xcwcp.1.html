       xcwcp - X Window-based Morse tutor program

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xcwcp</b>   [-s --system=<u>SYSTEM</u>]  [-d --device=<u>DEVICE</u>]  [-w --wpm=<u>WPM</u>]  [-t --tone=<u>HZ</u>]  [-v --volume=<u>PERCENT</u>]
       [-g --gap=<u>GAP</u>] [-f, --infile=<u>FILE</u>] [-F, --outifile=<u>FILE</u>] [-h --help] [-V --version]

       <b>xcwcp</b> installed on GNU/Linux systems understands both short form and  long  form  command  line  options.
       <b>xcwcp</b> installed on other operating systems may understand only the short form options.

       There are no mandatory options.

       Options  may be predefined in the environment variable <b>XCWCP_OPTIONS</b>.  If defined, these options are used
       first; command line options take precedence.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xcwcp</b> is a X Window-based interactive Morse code tutor program.  It lets you  choose  from  a  number  of
       options  for  practice,  including  sending  random  characters,  random  words,  and characters from the
       keyboard.  It will also receive Morse code that you send using the keyboard or mouse as  a  Morse  keyer,
       and display the characters it sees.

   <b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>xcwcp</b> understands the following command line options.  The long form options may not be available in non-
       LINUX versions.

       <u>-s,</u> <u>--system=SYSTEM</u>
              Specifies  the  way  that  <b>xcwcp</b> generates tones.  Valid values are: <u>console</u> for tones through the
              console speaker, <u>alsa</u> for tones generated through the system sound card using ALSA  sound  system,
              <u>oss</u>  for  tones  generated  through  system sound card using OSS sound system, <u>soundcard</u> for tones
              generated through the system sound card, but without explicit selection  of  sound  system.  These
              values can be shortened to 'c', 'a', 'o', or 's', respectively. The default value is 'oss'.

       <u>-d,</u> <u>--device=DEVICE</u>
              Specifies  the  device file to open for generating a sound.  <b>xcwcp</b> will use default device if none
              is specified. The default devices are: <u>/dev/console</u> for sound produced  through  console,  <u>default</u>
              for  ALSA  sound  system,  <u>/dev/audio</u>  for OSS sound system.  See also <u>NOTES</u> <u>ON</u> <u>USING</u> <u>A</u> <u>SOUND</u> <u>CARD</u>
              below.

       <u>-w,</u> <u>--wpm=WPM</u>
              Sets the initial sending speed in words per minute.  The value must be  between  4  and  60.   The
              default value is 12 WPM.

       <u>-t,</u> <u>--tone=HZ</u>
              Sets  the  initial  sounder  pitch  in  Hz.  This value must be between 0 and 4,000.  A value of 0
              selects silent operation, and can be used for timing checks or other testing.  The  default  value
              is 800Hz,

       <u>-v,</u> <u>--volume=PERCENT</u>
              Sets  the initial sending volume, as a percentage of full scale volume.  The value must be between
              0 and 100.  The default value is 70 %.  Sound volumes work fully for sound card tones,  but  <b>xcwcp</b>
              cannot  control  the  volume of tones from the console speaker.  In this case, a volume of zero is
              silent, and all other volume values are simply sounded.

       <u>-g,</u> <u>--gap=GAP</u>
              Sets the initial extra gap, in dot lengths, between characters (the 'Farnsworth' delay).  It  must
              be between 0 and 60.  The default is 0.

       <u>-f,</u> <u>--infile=FILE</u>
              Specifies  a  text  file  that  <b>xcwcp</b>  can  read  to  configure  its  practice text.  See <u>CREATING</u>
              <u>CONFIGURATION</u> <u>FILES</u> below.

       <u>-F,</u> <u>--outfile=FILE</u>
              Specifies a text file to which <b>xcwcp</b> should write its current practice text.

   <b>USER</b> <b>INTERFACE</b>
       <b>xcwcp</b> offers GUI controls for changing the speed, tone frequency,  'Farnsworth'  gap,  and  mode  of  the
       program.  All of the major controls are placed on the application toolbar.

       The main GUI window is used to display the characters that <b>xcwcp</b> sends or receives.

       To  find out more about what a particular GUI control does, use the "What's this..." icon (the '?' at the
       far right of the toolbar).

   <b>RANDOM</b> <b>CHARACTERS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>WORDS</b>
       <b>xcwcp</b> sends random characters in groups of five, with a space between each group.

       When sending random words, <b>xcwcp</b> sends the complete word, followed by a space.  Because short  words  are
       easier  to  copy  without  writing, <b>xcwcp</b>'s default dictionary contains only three, four, and five-letter
       words in its random words list.

       <b>xcwcp</b> chooses at random from a list of around 3000 words in its default dictionary.  You can change  this
       text using a configuration file, read at startup.  See <u>CREATING</u> <u>CONFIGURATION</u> <u>FILES</u> below.

   <b>RECEIVING</b> <b>MORSE</b>
       <b>xcwcp</b> can receive Morse code, and display it in its main GUI window.  To key Morse code into the program,
       select  the Receive Keyed CW mode, and press the stop/start button.  Now, place the mouse cursor over the
       central window of the program.  By pressing the middle mouse button, you should be able to key Morse into
       the program as if the mouse button was a straight Morse key.

       For better keying, you can use the left and right mouse buttons as if they  were  paddles  on  an  Iambic
       keyer.  This will send Morse code at the exact rate set on the Speed control.

       You can also use the keyboard for keying.  In this case, any of the Up or Down cursor keys, Space, Enter,
       or  Return  may be used as the straight key, and the Left and Right cursor keys act as the two paddles of
       an Iambic keyer.

       By default, <b>xcwcp</b> will try to follow the speed of the Morse code that you send to it.  It is possible  to
       switch  this tracking off, in which case the program switches to receiving only at the exact speed set on
       the Speed control.  However, fixed speed receiving is very, very picky  about  receiving  only  extremely
       accurately  timed Morse code, so unless you are striving for complete perfection, you may find that speed
       tracking is more comfortable.

       The speed tracking in <b>xcwcp</b> can sometime be confused by very wide and abrupt changes in speed.  If it  is
       having difficulty finding the speed you are sending at, you can use the File pulldown menu to synchronize
       the receive speed to the speed set on the Speed control.

       At any time, the mode selection combowidget can get focus by using Alt+M.  You can then use the space bar
       or  the  up/down keys to change the mode.  The Tab key moves to the next widget, so you can change speed,
       etc.  Shift+Tab moves backwards.

   <b>NOTES</b> <b>ON</b> <b>USING</b> <b>A</b> <b>SOUND</b> <b>CARD</b>
       By default, <b>xcwcp</b> tries to open OSS device "/dev/audio"  to  access  the  system  sound  card.   This  is
       generally  the  correct  device to use, but for systems with special requirements, or those with multiple
       sound cards, the option <u>-d</u> or <u>--device</u>, combined with <u>-s</u> or <u>--system</u> can be used to  specify  the  device
       and  sound  system  for  sound  card access.  If the sound card device cannot be set up, <b>xcwcp</b> prints the
       error message

              cannot set up soundcard sound

       and exits.

       Sound card devices, when opened through OSS sound system, are usually single-access devices, so that when
       one process has opened the device, other processes are prevented from using it. In such cases <b>xcwcp</b>  will
       of  course  conflict  with  any  other  programs  that expect exclusive use of the system sound card (for
       example, MP3 players).  If <b>xcwcp</b> finds that the sound card is already busy, it prints the error message

              open /dev/audio: Device or resource busy

       and exits.

       The sound card device is not used if <b>xcwcp</b> is only sending tones on the console speaker.

   <b>SOUND</b> <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>-</b> <b>DEFAULTS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SELECTION</b>
       <b>xcwcp</b> first tries to access sound card using PulseAudio sound system, using default device  name,  unless
       user specifies other sound device with option <u>-d</u> or <u>--device</u>.

       <b>xcwcp</b>  then  tries  to  access  sound  card  using  OSS  sound  system  and default OSS sound device name
       ('/dev/audio'), unless user specifies other sound device with option <u>-d</u> or <u>--device</u>.

       If opening soundcard through OSS fails, <b>xcwcp</b> tries to access the sound card using ALSA sound system, and
       default ALSA sound device name ('default'), unless user specifies other sound device with  option  <u>-d</u>  or
       <u>--device</u>.

       If  opening  soundcard through ALSA also fails, <b>xcwcp</b> tries to access system console buzzer using default
       buzzer device '/dev/console', unless user specifies other sound device with option <u>-d</u> or <u>--device</u>.

       It is very common that in order to access the console buzzer device user has  to  have  root  privileges.
       For  that reason trying to open console buzzer almost always fails.  This is not a program's bug, this is
       a result of operating system's restrictions.  Making <b>xcwcp</b> an suid binary bypasses this restriction.  The
       program does not fork() or exec(), so making it suid should be relatively safe.  Note however  that  this
       practice is discouraged for security reasons.

       As  stated, user can tell <b>xcwcp</b> which device to use, using <u>-d</u> or <u>--device</u> option.  Which device files are
       suitable will depend on which operating system is running, which system user ID  runs  <b>xcwcp</b>,  and  which
       user groups user belongs to.

   <b>CREATING</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILES</b>
       <b>xcwcp</b>  contains  a  default  set  of modes and practice text that should be enough to begin with.  It can
       however read in a file at startup that reconfigures these to provide different character groupings,  word
       sets, and other practice data.

       To read a configuration file, use the <u>-i</u> or <u>--infile</u> command line option.  The file should introduce each
       <b>xcwcp</b>  mode with a section header in '[' ... ']' characters, followed by the practice text for that mode,
       with elements separated by whitespace.  Lines starting with a semicolon or hash are treated as  comments.
       For example

              ; Simple example mode
              [ A to Z ]
              A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

       <b>xcwcp</b>  will  generate five character groups for modes whose elements are all single characters, and treat
       other modes as having elements that are complete words.  As a starting point for customized modes,  <b>xcwcp</b>
       will write its default configuration to a file if given the undocumented <u>-#</u> option, for example "xcwcp -#
       /tmp/xcwcp.ini".

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xcwcp</b>  is  an  X  Window  rewrite  of  <b>cwcp</b>.   Both programs borrow heavily from the DOS Morse code tutor
       CP222C.EXE, by VU2ZAP.

       The characters echoed in the main GUI window may be ASCII equivalents of Morse  procedural  signals;  see
       the <b>cw</b>(7,LOCAL) man page for details.

   <b>HINTS</b> <b>ON</b> <b>LEARNING</b> <b>MORSE</b> <b>CODE</b>
       Here are a few hints and tips that may help with the process of learning Morse code.

       Firstly,  do  <b>NOT</b>  think of the elements as dots and dashes.  Instead, think of them as dits and dahs (so
       'A' is di-dah).  If you think of them in this way, the process of translating sound into characters  will
       be learned much more easily.

       Do  not  learn  the characters from a table.  Learn them by watching the groups appear on the screen, and
       listening to the sounds produced as each is sent.  In the very initial stages, it may  be  beneficial  if
       you can find a person to take you through the first stages of recognising characters.

       Do  not  waste  your  time  learning  Morse  code at 5 WPM.  Set the speed to 12 or 15 WPM, but use extra
       spacing (the Gap window) to reduce the effective speed to much lower - around four or five WPM  <u>effective</u>
       speed.   This way, you will learn the rhythm of the characters as they are sent, but still have plenty of
       time between characters.  As you practice, decrease the gap to zero.

       Learn in stages.  Start by learning the <u>EISH5</u> group, then progress down through the menu as each group is
       mastered.  The groups contain characters which are in some way related, either by sound, or  by  type  of
       character.

       Once  you  have completed all the groups <u>EISH5</u> to <u>,?.;)/</u> (or <u>23789</u> if you do not want to learn procedural
       signals yet), use the full character set options, and the words and CW words  options,  to  sharpen  your
       skill.  If you have difficulties with particular characters, return to that group and practice again with
       a smaller character set.

       Resist  the  temptation to try to learn or improve your speed by copying off-air.  You will not know what
       speed you are working at, and much hand-sent Morse is not perfectly formed.  What you  can  gain  off-air
       though  is a general 'resilience', a tolerance for Morse code where the timing of individual elements, or
       spacing between characters and words, is not 100% accurate.

       If working to attain a particular speed for a test, always set the speed slightly higher.   For  example,
       if  aiming  for  12 WPM, set the tutor speed to 14 or 15 WPM.  This way, when you drop back to 12 WPM you
       will feel much more relaxed about copying.  Be aware that <b>xcwcp</b> is  not  necessarily  going  to  send  at
       exactly  the speed you set, due to limitations in what can be done with UNIX timers.  It often sends at a
       slower speed than you set, so be very careful with this if you have a  target  speed  that  you  need  to
       reach.

       Use  the  program  to make cassette tapes that you can take with you in a walkman or in the car, for long
       journeys.  You do not have to write down everything you hear to practice Morse code.  Simply listening to
       the shapes of characters over a period will help to train your brain  into  effortless  recognition.   In
       fact, slavishly writing everything down becomes a barrier at speeds of 15-20 WPM and above, so if you can
       begin to copy without writing each character down, you will find progress much easier above these speeds.
       But  do  not  over-use  these  tapes,  otherwise you will quickly memorise them.  Re-record them with new
       contents at very regular intervals.

       Try to spend at least 15-30 minutes each  day  practicing.   Much  less  than  this  will  make  progress
       glacially slow.  But significantly more than an hour or so may just result in you becoming tired, but not
       improving.  Recognise when it is time to stop for the day.

       Do  not  worry  if  you reach a speed 'plateau'.  This is common, and you will soon pass it with a little
       perseverance.

       At higher speeds, CW operators tend to recognise the 'shape' of whole words, rather than  the  individual
       characters  within  the words.  The CW words menu option can be used to help to practice and develop this
       skill.

       Neither the mouse buttons nor the keyboard are ideal for  use  a  keys  or  keyer  paddles,  for  sending
       practice.  Try to use a proper key for sending where possible.  It is hard even for experienced operators
       to  get  good  keying  using the mouse or keyboard.  Of the two, the mouse is probably the better option,
       though, in a pinch.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>OMISSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The calibration option is a bit ropy.  It simply sends PARIS repeatedly, and relies on you  to  time  the
       sending  and  then work out if any adjustment to the speed is really necessary.  Automatic calibration by
       making measurements over a given period would be a lot better.
