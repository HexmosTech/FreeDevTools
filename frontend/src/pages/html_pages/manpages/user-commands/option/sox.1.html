</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Introduction</b>
       SoX reads and writes audio files in most popular formats and can optionally apply effects to them. It can
       combine  multiple  input  sources, synthesise audio, and, on many systems, act as a general purpose audio
       player or a multi-track audio recorder. It also has limited ability to  split  the  input  into  multiple
       output files.

       All  SoX functionality is available using just the <b>sox</b> command.  To simplify playing and recording audio,
       if SoX is invoked as <b>play</b>, the output file is automatically set to be the default sound  device,  and  if
       invoked  as  <b>rec</b>, the default sound device is used as an input source.  Additionally, the <b><a href="../man1/soxi.1.html">soxi</a></b>(1) command
       provides a convenient way to just query audio file header information.

       The heart of SoX is a library called libSoX.  Those interested in extending SoX  or  using  it  in  other
       programs should refer to the libSoX manual page: <b><a href="../man3/libsox.3.html">libsox</a></b>(3).

       SoX  is  a  command-line  audio processing tool, particularly suited to making quick, simple edits and to
       batch processing.  If you need an interactive, graphical audio editor, use <b><a href="../man1/audacity.1.html">audacity</a></b>(1).
                                                  *        *        *

       The overall SoX processing chain can be summarised as follows:
                                       Input(s) → Combiner → Effects → Output(s)

       Note however, that on the SoX command line, the positions of the Output(s) and the  Effects  are  swapped
       w.r.t.  the logical flow just shown.  Note also that whilst options pertaining to files are placed before
       their respective file name, the opposite is true for effects.  To show how this works in  practice,  here
       is a selection of examples of how SoX might be used.  The simple
          sox recital.au recital.wav
       translates an audio file in Sun AU format to a Microsoft WAV file, whilst
          sox recital.au -b 16 recital.wav channels 1 rate 16k fade 3 norm
       performs the same format translation, but also applies four effects (down-mix to one channel, sample rate
       change, fade-in, nomalize), and stores the result at a bit-depth of 16.
          sox -r 16k -e signed -b 8 -c 1 voice-memo.raw voice-memo.wav
       converts `raw' (a.k.a. `headerless') audio to a self-describing file format,
          sox slow.aiff fixed.aiff speed 1.027
       adjusts audio speed,
          sox short.wav long.wav longer.wav
       concatenates two audio files, and
          sox -m music.mp3 voice.wav mixed.flac
       mixes together two audio files.
          play "The Moonbeams/Greatest/*.ogg" bass +3
       plays a collection of audio files whilst applying a bass boosting effect,
          play -n -c1 synth sin %-12 sin %-9 sin %-5 sin %-2 fade h 0.1 1 0.1
       plays a synthesised `A minor seventh' chord with a pipe-organ sound,
          rec -c 2 radio.aiff trim 0 30:00
       records half an hour of stereo audio, and
          play -q take1.aiff &amp; rec -M take1.aiff take1-dub.aiff
       (with  POSIX  shell  and  where  supported  by  hardware) records a new track in a multi-track recording.
       Finally,
          rec -r 44100 -b 16 -e signed-integer -p \
            silence 1 0.50 0.1% 1 10:00 0.1% | \
            sox -p song.ogg silence 1 0.50 0.1% 1 2.0 0.1% : \
            newfile : restart
       records a stream of audio such as LP/cassette and splits in to multiple audio  files  at  points  with  2
       seconds  of silence.  Also, it does not start recording until it detects audio is playing and stops after
       it sees 10 minutes of silence.

       N.B.  The above is just an overview of SoX's capabilities; detailed explanations of how to  use  <u>all</u>  SoX
       parameters, file formats, and effects can be found below in this manual, in <b><a href="../man7/soxformat.7.html">soxformat</a></b>(7), and in <b><a href="../man1/soxi.1.html">soxi</a></b>(1).

   <b>File</b> <b>Format</b> <b>Types</b>
       SoX  can  work  with `self-describing' and `raw' audio files.  `self-describing' formats (e.g. WAV, FLAC,
       MP3) have a header that completely describes the signal and encoding attributes of the  audio  data  that
       follows.  `raw'  or `headerless' formats do not contain this information, so the audio characteristics of
       these must be described on the SoX command line or inferred from those of the input file.

       The following four characteristics are used to describe the format of audio data  such  that  it  can  be
       processed with SoX:

       sample rate
              The  sample  rate in samples per second (`Hertz' or `Hz').  Digital telephony traditionally uses a
              sample rate of 8000 Hz (8 kHz), though these days, 16 and even 32 kHz are  becoming  more  common.
              Audio  Compact  Discs  use  44100 Hz  (44.1 kHz). Digital Audio Tape and many computer systems use
              48 kHz. Professional audio systems often use 96 kHz.

       sample size
              The number of bits used to store each sample.  Today, 16-bit is commonly used. 8-bit  was  popular
              in  the  early days of computer audio. 24-bit is used in the professional audio arena. Other sizes
              are also used.

       data encoding
              The way in which each audio sample is represented (or `encoded').  Some  encodings  have  variants
              with  different  byte-orderings or bit-orderings.  Some compress the audio data so that the stored
              audio data takes up less space (i.e. disk space or transmission bandwidth) than the  other  format
              parameters  and the number of samples would imply.  Commonly-used encoding types include floating-
              point, μ-law, ADPCM, signed-integer PCM, MP3, and FLAC.

       channels
              The number of audio channels contained in the file.  One (`mono') and two  (`stereo')  are  widely
              used.  `Surround sound' audio typically contains six or more channels.

       The term `bit-rate' is a measure of the amount of storage occupied by an encoded audio signal over a unit
       of  time.  It can depend on all of the above and is typically denoted as a number of kilo-bits per second
       (kbps).  An A-law telephony signal has a bit-rate of 64 kbps. MP3-encoded stereo music  typically  has  a
       bit-rate of 128-196 kbps. FLAC-encoded stereo music typically has a bit-rate of 550-760 kbps.

       Most self-describing formats also allow textual `comments' to be embedded in the file that can be used to
       describe the audio in some way, e.g. for music, the title, the author, etc.

       One  important  use of audio file comments is to convey `Replay Gain' information.  SoX supports applying
       Replay Gain information (for certain input file formats only; currently, at least FLAC and  Ogg  Vorbis),
       but not generating it.  Note that by default, SoX copies input file comments to output files that support
       comments,  so output files may contain Replay Gain information if some was present in the input file.  In
       this case, if anything other than a simple format conversion was performed then the  output  file  Replay
       Gain  information is likely to be incorrect and so should be recalculated using a tool that supports this
       (not SoX).

       The <b><a href="../man1/soxi.1.html">soxi</a></b>(1) command can be used to display information from audio file headers.

   <b>Determining</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>Setting</b> <b>The</b> <b>File</b> <b>Format</b>
       There are several mechanisms available for SoX to use to determine or set the format  characteristics  of
       an audio file.  Depending on the circumstances, individual characteristics may be determined or set using
       different mechanisms.

       To determine the format of an input file, SoX will use, in order of precedence and as given or available:

       1.  Command-line format options.

       2.  The contents of the file header.

       3.  The filename extension.

       To set the output file format, SoX will use, in order of precedence and as given or available:

       1.  Command-line format options.

       2.  The filename extension.

       3.  The input file format characteristics, or the closest that is supported by the output file type.

       For  all  files,  SoX  will exit with an error if the file type cannot be determined. Command-line format
       options may need to be added or changed to resolve the problem.

   <b>Playing</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>Recording</b> <b>Audio</b>
       The <b>play</b> and <b>rec</b> commands are provided so that basic playing and recording is as simple as
          play existing-file.wav
       and
          rec new-file.wav
       These two commands are functionally equivalent to
          sox existing-file.wav -d
       and
          sox -d new-file.wav
       Of course, further options and effects (as described below) can be added to the commands in either form.
                                                  *        *        *

       Some systems provide more than one type of (SoX-compatible) audio driver, e.g. ALSA &amp; OSS, or SUNAU &amp; AO.
       Systems can also have more than one audio device (a.k.a. `sound card').  If more than  one  audio  driver
       has  been  built-in to SoX, and the default selected by SoX when recording or playing is not the one that
       is wanted, then the <b>AUDIODRIVER</b> environment variable can be used to override the  default.   For  example
       (on many systems):
          set AUDIODRIVER=oss
          play ...
       The <b>AUDIODEV</b> environment variable can be used to override the default audio device, e.g.
          set AUDIODEV=/dev/dsp2
          play ...
          sox ... -t oss
       or
          set AUDIODEV=hw:soundwave,1,2
          play ...
          sox ... -t alsa
       Note  that  the  way  of  setting  environment variables varies from system to system - for some specific
       examples, see `SOX_OPTS' below.

       When playing a file with a sample rate that is not  supported  by  the  audio  output  device,  SoX  will
       automatically  invoke the <b>rate</b> effect to perform the necessary sample rate conversion.  For compatibility
       with old hardware, the default <b>rate</b> quality level is set to `low'. This  can  be  changed  by  explicitly
       specifying the <b>rate</b> effect with a different quality level, e.g.
          play ... rate -m
       or by using the <b>--play-rate-arg</b> option (see below).
                                                  *        *        *

       On  some  systems,  SoX  allows audio playback volume to be adjusted whilst using <b>play</b>.  Where supported,
       this is achieved by tapping the `v' &amp; `V' keys during playback.

       To help with setting a suitable recording level, SoX includes a peak-level meter  which  can  be  invoked
       (before making the actual recording) as follows:
          rec -n
       The  recording  level  should  be adjusted (using the system-provided mixer program, not SoX) so that the
       meter is <u>at</u> <u>most</u> <u>occasionally</u> full scale, and never `in the red' (an exclamation  mark  is  shown).   See
       also <b>-S</b> below.

   <b>Accuracy</b>
       Many  file  formats  that  compress  audio  discard some of the audio signal information whilst doing so.
       Converting to such a format and then converting back again will not produce an exact copy of the original
       audio.  This is the case for many formats used in telephony (e.g. A-law, GSM) where low signal  bandwidth
       is  more  important  than  high audio fidelity, and for many formats used in portable music players (e.g.
       MP3, Vorbis) where adequate fidelity can be retained even with the  large  compression  ratios  that  are
       needed to make portable players practical.

       Formats  that  discard  audio  signal  information  are  called  `lossy'.  Formats that do not are called
       `lossless'.  The term `quality' is used as a measure of how closely the  original  audio  signal  can  be
       reproduced when using a lossy format.

       Audio  file  conversion  with SoX is lossless when it can be, i.e. when not using lossy compression, when
       not reducing the sampling rate or number of channels, and when the number of bits used in the destination
       format is not less than in the source format.  E.g.  converting from an 8-bit PCM format to a 16-bit  PCM
       format is lossless but converting from an 8-bit PCM format to (8-bit) A-law isn't.

       <b>N.B.</b>   SoX  converts  all  audio  files  to  an  internal uncompressed format before performing any audio
       processing. This means that manipulating a file that is stored in a lossy format can cause further losses
       in audio fidelity.  E.g. with
          sox long.mp3 short.mp3 trim 10
       SoX first decompresses the input MP3 file, then applies the <b>trim</b> effect, and finally creates  the  output
       MP3  file  by  re-compressing the audio - with a possible reduction in fidelity above that which occurred
       when the input file was created.  Hence, if what is ultimately desired is lossily compressed audio, it is
       highly recommended to perform all audio processing using lossless file formats and then  convert  to  the
       lossy format only at the final stage.

       <b>N.B.</b>   Applying  multiple  effects  with  a single SoX invocation will, in general, produce more accurate
       results than those produced using multiple SoX invocations.

   <b>Dithering</b>
       Dithering is a technique used to maximise the dynamic range of audio stored at  a  particular  bit-depth.
       Any  distortion introduced by quantisation is decorrelated by adding a small amount of white noise to the
       signal.  In most cases, SoX can determine whether the selected processing requires dither and will add it
       during output formatting if appropriate.

       Specifically, by default, SoX automatically adds TPDF dither when the output bit-depth is  less  than  24
       and any of the following are true:

       •   bit-depth reduction has been specified explicitly using a command-line option

       •   the output file format supports only bit-depths lower than that of the input file format

       •   an effect has increased effective bit-depth within the internal processing chain

       For example, adjusting volume with <b>vol</b> <b>0.25</b> requires two additional bits in which to losslessly store its
       results  (since  0.25  decimal  equals  0.01  binary).   So if the input file bit-depth is 16, then SoX's
       internal representation will utilise 18 bits after processing this volume change.  In order to store  the
       output at the same depth as the input, dithering is used to remove the additional bits.

       Use  the  <b>-V</b>  option  to  see  what processing SoX has automatically added. The <b>-D</b> option may be given to
       override automatic dithering.  To invoke dithering manually (e.g. to select a noise-shaping  curve),  see
       the <b>dither</b> effect.

   <b>Clipping</b>
       Clipping  is  distortion  that  occurs  when an audio signal level (or `volume') exceeds the range of the
       chosen representation.  In most cases, clipping is undesirable and so should be  corrected  by  adjusting
       the level prior to the point (in the processing chain) at which it occurs.

       In  SoX,  clipping  could  occur, as you might expect, when using the <b>vol</b> or <b>gain</b> effects to increase the
       audio volume. Clipping could also occur with many other effects, when converting one format  to  another,
       and even when simply playing the audio.

       Playing  an  audio  file often involves resampling, and processing by analogue components can introduce a
       small DC offset and/or amplification, all of which can produce distortion if the audio signal  level  was
       initially too close to the clipping point.

       For  these  reasons, it is usual to make sure that an audio file's signal level has some `headroom', i.e.
       it does not exceed a particular level below the maximum possible  level  for  the  given  representation.
       Some standards bodies recommend as much as 9dB headroom, but in most cases, 3dB (≈ 70% linear) is enough.
       Note  that  this wisdom seems to have been lost in modern music production; in fact, many CDs, MP3s, etc.
       are now mastered at levels <u>above</u> 0dBFS i.e. the audio is clipped as delivered.

       SoX's <b>stat</b> and <b>stats</b> effects can assist in determining the signal level in an audio file. The <b>gain</b> or <b>vol</b>
       effect can be used to prevent clipping, e.g.
          sox dull.wav bright.wav gain -6 treble +6
       guarantees that the treble boost will not clip.

       If clipping occurs at any point during processing, SoX will display a warning message to that effect.

       See also <b>-G</b> and the <b>gain</b> and <b>norm</b> effects.

   <b>Input</b> <b>File</b> <b>Combining</b>
       SoX's input combiner can be configured (see OPTIONS below) to combine multiple files  using  any  of  the
       following  methods:  `concatenate',  `sequence', `mix', `mix-power', `merge', or `multiply'.  The default
       method is `sequence' for <b>play</b>, and `concatenate' for <b>rec</b> and <b>sox</b>.

       For all methods other than `sequence', multiple  input  files  must  have  the  same  sampling  rate.  If
       necessary, separate SoX invocations can be used to make sampling rate adjustments prior to combining.

       If the `concatenate' combining method is selected (usually, this will be by default) then the input files
       must  also have the same number of channels.  The audio from each input will be concatenated in the order
       given to form the output file.

       The `sequence' combining method is selected automatically for <b>play</b>.  It is similar  to  `concatenate'  in
       that  the  audio  from each input file is sent serially to the output file. However, here the output file
       may be closed and reopened at the corresponding transition between input files. This may be just what  is
       needed  when  sending  different types of audio to an output device, but is not generally useful when the
       output is a normal file.

       If either the `mix' or `mix-power' combining method is selected then two or  more  input  files  must  be
       given and will be mixed together to form the output file.  The number of channels in each input file need
       not  be  the same, but SoX will issue a warning if they are not and some channels in the output file will
       not contain audio from every input file.  A mixed audio file cannot be un-mixed without reference to  the
       original input files.

       If the `merge' combining method is selected then two or more input files must be given and will be merged
       together  to  form  the  output file.  The number of channels in each input file need not be the same.  A
       merged audio file comprises all of the channels from all of the input files. Un-merging is possible using
       multiple invocations of SoX with the <b>remix</b> effect.  For example, two mono files could be merged  to  form
       one  stereo  file. The first and second mono files would become the left and right channels of the stereo
       file.

       The `multiply' combining method multiplies the  sample  values  of  corresponding  channels  (treated  as
       numbers  in  the  interval  -1 to +1).  If the number of channels in the input files is not the same, the
       missing channels are considered to contain all zero.

       When combining input files, SoX applies any specified effects (including, for  example,  the  <b>vol</b>  volume
       adjustment  effect)  after the audio has been combined. However, it is often useful to be able to set the
       volume of (i.e. `balance') the inputs individually, before combining takes place.

       For all combining methods, input file volume adjustments can be made manually using the <b>-v</b> option (below)
       which can be given for one or more input files. If it is given for only some of the input files then  the
       others  receive no volume adjustment.  In some circumstances, automatic volume adjustments may be applied
       (see below).

       The <b>-V</b> option (below) can be used to show the input file  volume  adjustments  that  have  been  selected
       (either manually or automatically).

       There are some special considerations that need to made when mixing input files:

       Unlike  the  other  methods,  `mix'  combining  has the potential to cause clipping in the combiner if no
       balancing is performed.  In this case, if manual volume adjustments are not given, SoX will try to ensure
       that clipping does not occur by automatically adjusting the volume (amplitude) of each input signal by  a
       factor  of  ¹/n,  where  n  is  the number of input files.  If this results in audio that is too quiet or
       otherwise unbalanced then the input file volumes can be set manually as described above. Using  the  <b>norm</b>
       effect on the mix is another alternative.

       If  mixed  audio  seems loud enough at some points but too quiet in others then dynamic range compression
       should be applied to correct this - see the <b>compand</b> effect.

       With the `mix-power' combine method, the mixed volume is approximately equal to that of one of the  input
       signals.   This is achieved by balancing using a factor of ¹/√n instead of ¹/n.  Note that this balancing
       factor does not guarantee that clipping will not occur, but the number of clips will usually be  low  and
       the resultant distortion is generally imperceptible.

   <b>Output</b> <b>Files</b>
       SoX's default behaviour is to take one or more input files and write them to a single output file.

       This  behaviour  can  be  changed by specifying the pseudo-effect `newfile' within the effects list.  SoX
       will then enter multiple output mode.

       In multiple output mode, a new file is created when the effects prior to the `newfile' indicate they  are
       done.   The  effects  chain  listed after `newfile' is then started up and its output is saved to the new
       file.

       In multiple output mode, a unique number will automatically be appended to the end of all filenames.   If
       the  filename  has  an extension then the number is inserted before the extension.  This behaviour can be
       customized by placing a %n anywhere in the filename where the number should be substituted.  An  optional
       number can be placed after the % to indicate a minimum fixed width for the number.

       Multiple  output  mode  is  not  very  useful  unless an effect that will stop the effects chain early is
       specified before the `newfile'. If end of file is reached before the effects chain stops itself  then  no
       new file will be created as it would be empty.

       The  following  is an example of splitting the first 60 seconds of an input file into two 30 second files
       and ignoring the rest.

   <b>Stopping</b> <b>SoX</b>
       Usually SoX will complete its processing and exit automatically once it has read all available audio data
       from the input files.

       If desired, it can be terminated earlier by sending an  interrupt  signal  to  the  process  (usually  by
       pressing  the  keyboard  interrupt  key which is normally Ctrl-C).  This is a natural requirement in some
       circumstances, e.g. when using SoX to make a recording.  Note that when using SoX to play multiple files,
       Ctrl-C behaves slightly differently: pressing it once causes SoX to skip to the next  file;  pressing  it
       twice in quick succession causes SoX to exit.

       Another  option  to  stop  processing early is to use an effect that has a time period or sample count to
       determine the stopping point. The trim effect is an example  of  this.   Once  all  effects  chains  have
       stopped then SoX will also stop.

</pre><h4><b>FILENAMES</b></h4><pre>
       Filenames  can  be  simple file names, absolute or relative path names, or URLs (input files only).  Note
       that URL support requires that <b><a href="../man1/wget.1.html">wget</a></b>(1) is available.

       Note: Giving SoX an input or output filename that is the same as a SoX effect-name will  not  work  since
       SoX  will  treat it as an effect specification.  The only work-around to this is to avoid such filenames.
       This is generally not difficult since most audio filenames have a filename  `extension',  whilst  effect-
       names do not.

   <b>Special</b> <b>Filenames</b>
       The following special filenames may be used in certain circumstances in place of a normal filename on the
       command line:

       <b>-</b>      SoX  can be used in simple pipeline operations by using the special filename `-' which, if used as
              an input filename, will cause SoX will read audio data from `standard input' (stdin),  and  which,
              if used as the output filename, will cause SoX will send audio data to `standard output' (stdout).
              Note  that  when  using  this option for the output file, and sometimes when using it for an input
              file, the file-type (see <b>-t</b> below) must also be given.

       <b>"|</b><u>program</u> [<u>options</u>] ...<b>"</b>
              This can be used in place of an input filename to specify the the given program's standard  output
              (stdout)  be  used as an input file.  Unlike <b>-</b> (above), this can be used for several inputs to one
              SoX command.  For example, if `genw' generates mono WAV formatted signals to its standard  output,
              then the following command makes a stereo file from two generated signals:
                 sox -M "|genw --imd -" "|genw --thd -" out.wav
              For headerless (raw) audio, <b>-t</b> (and perhaps other format options) will need to be given, preceding
              the input command.

       <b>"</b><u>wildcard-filename</u><b>"</b>
              Specifies  that  filename `globbing' (wild-card matching) should be performed by SoX instead of by
              the shell.  This allows a single set of file options to be applied  to  a  group  of  files.   For
              example, if the current directory contains three `vox' files, file1.vox, file2.vox, and file3.vox,
              then
                 play --rate 6k *.vox
              will be expanded by the `shell' (in most environments) to
                 play --rate 6k file1.vox file2.vox file3.vox
              which will treat only the first vox file as having a sample rate of 6k.  With
                 play --rate 6k "*.vox"
              the given sample rate option will be applied to all three vox files.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--sox-pipe</b>
              This  can be used in place of an output filename to specify that the SoX command should be used as
              in input pipe to another SoX command.  For example, the command:
                 play "|sox -n -p synth 2" "|sox -n -p synth 2 tremolo 10" stat
              plays two `files' in succession, each with different effects.

              <b>-p</b> is in fact an alias for `<b>-t</b> <b>sox</b> <b>-</b>'.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--default-device</b>
              This can be used in place of an input or output filename to specify that the default audio  device
              (if  one  has  been  built  into  SoX)  is  to  be used.  This is akin to invoking <b>rec</b> or <b>play</b> (as
              described above).

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--null</b>
              This can be used in place of an input or output filename to specify that a `null file'  is  to  be
              used.   Note  that  here, `null file' refers to a SoX-specific mechanism and is not related to any
              operating-system mechanism with a similar name.

              Using a null file to input audio is equivalent to using a  normal  audio  file  that  contains  an
              infinite  amount  of  silence, and as such is not generally useful unless used with an effect that
              specifies a finite time length (such as <b>trim</b> or <b>synth</b>).

              Using a null file to output audio amounts to discarding  the  audio  and  is  useful  mainly  with
              effects  that  produce  information  about the audio instead of affecting it (such as <b>noiseprof</b> or
              <b>stat</b>).

              The sampling rate associated with a null file is by default 48 kHz, but, as with  a  normal  file,
              this can be overridden if desired using command-line format options (see below).

   <b>Supported</b> <b>File</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Device</b> <b>Types</b>
       See <b><a href="../man7/soxformat.7.html">soxformat</a></b>(7) for a list and description of the supported file formats and audio device drivers.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Global</b> <b>Options</b>
       These options can be specified on the command line at any point before the first effect name.

       The  <b>SOX_OPTS</b>  environment  variable  can  be used to provide alternative default values for SoX's global
       options.  For example:
          SOX_OPTS="--buffer 20000 --play-rate-arg -hs --temp /mnt/temp"
       Note that setting SOX_OPTS can potentially create unwanted changes in the behaviour of scripts  or  other
       programs  that  invoke  SoX.   SOX_OPTS might best be used for things (such as in the given example) that
       reflect the environment in which SoX is being run.  Enabling options  such  as  <b>--no-clobber</b>  as  default
       might be handled better using a shell alias since a shell alias will not affect operation in scripts etc.

       One  way  to ensure that a script cannot be affected by SOX_OPTS is to clear SOX_OPTS at the start of the
       script, but this of course loses the benefit of SOX_OPTS carrying some system-wide default  options.   An
       alternative approach is to explicitly invoke SoX with default option values, e.g.
          SOX_OPTS="-V --no-clobber"
          ...
          sox -V2 --clobber $input $output ...
       Note that the way to set environment variables varies from system to system. Here are some examples:

       Unix bash:
          export SOX_OPTS="-V --no-clobber"
       Unix csh:
          setenv SOX_OPTS "-V --no-clobber"
       MS-DOS/MS-Windows:
          set SOX_OPTS=-V --no-clobber
       MS-Windows GUI: via Control Panel : System : Advanced : Environment Variables

       Mac OS X GUI: Refer to Apple's Technical Q&amp;A QA1067 document.

       <b>--buffer</b> <b>BYTES</b>, <b>--input-buffer</b> <b>BYTES</b>
              Set  the  size in bytes of the buffers used for processing audio (default 8192).  <b>--buffer</b> applies
              to input, effects, and output processing; <b>--input-buffer</b> applies only  to  input  processing  (for
              which it overrides <b>--buffer</b> if both are given).

              Be aware that large values for <b>--buffer</b> will cause SoX to be become slow to respond to requests to
              terminate or to skip the current input file.

       <b>--clobber</b>
              Don't  prompt  before overwriting an existing file with the same name as that given for the output
              file.  This is the default behaviour.

       <b>--combine</b> <b>concatenate</b>|<b>merge</b>|<b>mix</b>|<b>mix-power</b>|<b>multiply</b>|<b>sequence</b>
              Select the input file combining method; for some of these, short options are available: <b>-m</b> selects
              `mix', <b>-M</b> selects `merge', and <b>-T</b> selects `multiply'.

              See <b>Input</b> <b>File</b> <b>Combining</b> above for a description of the different combining methods.

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--no-dither</b>
              Disable automatic dither - see `Dithering' above.  An example of why this  might  occasionally  be
              useful  is  if  a  file  has  been  converted  from  16 to 24 bit with the intention of doing some
              processing on it, but in fact no processing is needed after all and the original 16 bit  file  has
              been  lost,  then,  strictly  speaking, no dither is needed if converting the file back to 16 bit.
              See also the <b>stats</b> effect for how to determine the actual bit depth of the audio within a file.

       <b>--effects-file</b> <u>FILENAME</u>
              Use FILENAME to obtain all effects and their arguments.  The file is parsed as if the values  were
              specified  on  the  command  line.   A  new  line  can be used in place of the special <b>:</b> marker to
              separate effect chains.  For convenience, such markers  at  the  end  of  the  file  are  normally
              ignored;  if  you  want to specify an empty last effects chain, use an explicit <b>:</b> by itself on the
              last line of the file.  This option causes any  effects  specified  on  the  command  line  to  be
              discarded.

       <b>-G</b>, <b>--guard</b>
              Automatically invoke the <b>gain</b> effect to guard against clipping. E.g.
                 sox -G infile -b 16 outfile rate 44100 dither -s
              is shorthand for
                 sox infile -b 16 outfile gain -h rate 44100 gain -rh dither -s
              See also <b>-V,</b> <b>--norm,</b> and the <b>gain</b> effect.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Show version number and usage information.

       <b>--help-effect</b> <u>NAME</u>
              Show  usage  information  on  the specified effect.  The name <b>all</b> can be used to show usage on all
              effects.

       <b>--help-format</b> <u>NAME</u>
              Show information about the specified file format.  The name <b>all</b> can be used to show information on
              all formats.

       <b>--i</b>, <b>--info</b>
              Only if given as the first parameter to <b>sox</b>, behave as <b><a href="../man1/soxi.1.html">soxi</a></b>(1).

       <b>-m</b>|<b>-M</b>  Equivalent to <b>--combine</b> <b>mix</b> and <b>--combine</b> <b>merge</b>, respectively.

       <b>--magic</b>
              If SoX has been built with the optional `libmagic' library then this option can be given to enable
              its use in helping to detect audio file types.

       <b>--multi-threaded</b> | <b>--single-threaded</b>
              By default, SoX is `single threaded'.  If the <b>--multi-threaded</b> option is given  however  then  SoX
              will  process  audio channels for most multi-channel effects in parallel on hyper-threading/multi-
              core architectures. This may reduce processing time, though sometimes it may be necessary  to  use
              this  option in conjunction with a larger buffer size than is the default to gain any benefit from
              multi-threaded processing (e.g. 131072; see <b>--buffer</b> above).

       <b>--no-clobber</b>
              Prompt before overwriting an existing file with the same name as that given for the output file.

              <b>N.B.</b>  Unintentionally overwriting a file is easier than you  might  think,  for  example,  if  you
              accidentally enter
                 sox file1 file2 effect1 effect2 ...
              when what you really meant was
                 play file1 file2 effect1 effect2 ...
              then,  without  this  option, file2 will be overwritten.  Hence, using this option is recommended.
              SOX_OPTS (above), a `shell' alias, script, or batch file may be an appropriate way of  permanently
              enabling it.

       <b>--norm</b>[<b>=</b><u>dB-level</u>]
              Automatically invoke the <b>gain</b> effect to guard against clipping and to normalise the audio. E.g.
                 sox --norm infile -b 16 outfile rate 44100 dither -s
              is shorthand for
                 sox infile -b 16 outfile gain -h rate 44100 gain -nh dither -s
              Optionally, the audio can be normalized to a given level (usually) below 0 dBFS:
                 sox --norm=-3 infile outfile

              See also <b>-V,</b> <b>-G,</b> and the <b>gain</b> effect.

       <b>--play-rate-arg</b> <b>ARG</b>
              Selects a quality option to be used when the `rate' effect is automatically invoked whilst playing
              audio.  This option is typically set via the <b>SOX_OPTS</b> environment variable (see above).

       <b>--plot</b> <b>gnuplot</b>|<b>octave</b>|<b>off</b>
              If  not  set  to  <b>off</b>  (the  default  if  <b>--plot</b> is not given), run in a mode that can be used, in
              conjunction with the gnuplot program or the GNU Octave program, to assist with the  selection  and
              configuration  of  many  of  the transfer-function based effects.  For the first given effect that
              supports the selected plotting program, SoX will output commands to  plot  the  effect's  transfer
              function, and then exit without actually processing any audio.  E.g.
                 sox --plot octave input-file -n highpass 1320 &gt; highpass.plt
                 octave highpass.plt

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--no-show-progress</b>
              Run in quiet mode when SoX wouldn't otherwise do so.  This is the opposite of the <b>-S</b> option.

       <b>-R</b>     Run  in  `repeatable'  mode.   When this option is given, where applicable, SoX will embed a fixed
              time-stamp in the output file (e.g.  <b>AIFF</b>) and will `seed' pseudo random number  generators  (e.g.
              <b>dither</b>)  with  a  fixed number, thus ensuring that successive SoX invocations with the same inputs
              and the same parameters yield the same output.

       <b>--replay-gain</b> <b>track</b>|<b>album</b>|<b>off</b>
              Select whether or not to apply replay-gain adjustment to input files.  The default is <b>off</b> for  <b>sox</b>
              and <b>rec</b>, <b>album</b> for <b>play</b> where (at least) the first two input files are tagged with the same Artist
              and Album names, and <b>track</b> for <b>play</b> otherwise.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--show-progress</b>
              Display  input file format/header information, and processing progress as input file(s) percentage
              complete, elapsed time, and remaining time (if known;  shown  in  brackets),  and  the  number  of
              samples  written  to  the  output  file.   Also  shown is a peak-level meter, and an indication if
              clipping has occurred.  The peak-level meter shows up  to  two  channels  and  is  calibrated  for
              digital audio as follows (right channel shown):
                                             <u>dB</u> <u>FSD</u>   <u>Display</u>   <u>dB</u> <u>FSD</u>   <u>Display</u>
                                              -25     -          -11     ====
                                              -23     =           -9     ====-
                                              -21     =-          -7     =====
                                              -19     ==          -5     =====-
                                              -17     ==-         -3     ======
                                              -15     ===         -1     =====!
                                              -13     ===-

              A  three-second peak-held value of headroom in dBs will be shown to the right of the meter if this
              is below 6dB.

              This option is enabled by default when using SoX to play or record audio.

       <b>-T</b>     Equivalent to <b>--combine</b> <b>multiply</b>.

       <b>--temp</b> <u>DIRECTORY</u>
              Specify that any temporary files should be created in the given <u>DIRECTORY</u>.  This can be useful  if
              there are permission or free-space problems with the default location. In this case, using `<b>--temp</b>
              <b>.</b>' (to use the current directory) is often a good solution.

       <b>--version</b>
              Show SoX's version number and exit.

       <b>-V</b>[<u>level</u>]
              Set  verbosity. This is particularly useful for seeing how any automatic effects have been invoked
              by SoX.

              SoX displays messages on the console (stderr) according to the following verbosity levels:

              0      No messages are shown at all; use the exit status to determine if an error has occurred.

              1      Only error messages are shown.  These are generated if SoX cannot  complete  the  requested
                     commands.

              2      Warning  messages  are  also  shown.  These are generated if SoX can complete the requested
                     commands, but not exactly according to the requested command  parameters,  or  if  clipping
                     occurs.

              3      Descriptions  of SoX's processing phases are also shown.  Useful for seeing exactly how SoX
                     is processing your audio.

              4 and above
                     Messages to help with debugging SoX are also shown.

              By default, the verbosity level is set to 2 (shows errors and warnings). Each occurrence of the <b>-V</b>
              option increases the verbosity level by 1.  Alternatively, the verbosity level can be  set  to  an
              absolute number by specifying it immediately after the <b>-V</b>, e.g.  <b>-V0</b> sets it to 0.

   <b>Input</b> <b>File</b> <b>Options</b>
       These options apply only to input files and may precede only input filenames on the command line.

       <b>--ignore-length</b>
              Override an (incorrect) audio length given in an audio file's header. If this option is given then
              SoX will keep reading audio until it reaches the end of the input file.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--volume</b> <u>FACTOR</u>
              Intended  for  use when combining multiple input files, this option adjusts the volume of the file
              that follows it on the command line by a factor of <u>FACTOR</u>. This allows it to be `balanced'  w.r.t.
              the other input files.  This is a linear (amplitude) adjustment, so a number less than 1 decreases
              the  volume  and  a  number  greater  than  1 increases it.  If a negative number is given then in
              addition to the volume adjustment, the audio signal will be inverted.

              See also the <b>norm</b>, <b>vol</b>, and <b>gain</b> effects, and see <b>Input</b> <b>File</b> <b>Balancing</b> above.

   <b>Input</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>Output</b> <b>File</b> <b>Format</b> <b>Options</b>
       These options apply to the input or output file whose name they immediately precede on the  command  line
       and  are used mainly when working with headerless file formats or when specifying a format for the output
       file that is different to that of the input file.

       <b>-b</b> <u>BITS</u>, <b>--bits</b> <u>BITS</u>
              The number of bits (a.k.a. bit-depth or  sometimes  word-length)  in  each  encoded  sample.   Not
              applicable  to  complex  encodings  such  as MP3 or GSM.  Not necessary with encodings that have a
              fixed number of bits, e.g.  A/μ-law, ADPCM.

              For an input file, the most common use for this option is to inform SoX of the number of bits  per
              sample in a `raw' (`headerless') audio file.  For example
                 sox -r 16k -e signed -b 8 input.raw output.wav
              converts a particular `raw' file to a self-describing `WAV' file.

              For  an  output  file,  this option can be used (perhaps along with <b>-e</b>) to set the output encoding
              size.  By default (i.e. if this option is not given), the output encoding size will (providing  it
              is supported by the output file type) be set to the input encoding size.  For example
                 sox input.cdda -b 24 output.wav
              converts raw CD digital audio (16-bit, signed-integer) to a 24-bit (signed-integer) `WAV' file.

       <b>-c</b> <u>CHANNELS</u>, <b>--channels</b> <u>CHANNELS</u>
              The number of audio channels in the audio file. This can be any number greater than zero.

              For  an input file, the most common use for this option is to inform SoX of the number of channels
              in a `raw' (`headerless') audio file.  Occasionally, it may be useful to use this  option  with  a
              `headered'  file,  in order to override the (presumably incorrect) value in the header - note that
              this is only supported with certain file types.  Examples:
                 sox -r 48k -e float -b 32 -c 2 input.raw output.wav
              converts a particular `raw' file to a self-describing `WAV' file.
                 play -c 1 music.wav
              interprets the file data as belonging to a single channel regardless of what is indicated  in  the
              file  header.   Note that if the file does in fact have two channels, this will result in the file
              playing at half speed.

              For an output file, this option provides a shorthand  for  specifying  that  the  <b>channels</b>  effect
              should  be invoked in order to change (if necessary) the number of channels in the audio signal to
              the number given.  For example, the following two commands are equivalent:
                 sox input.wav -c 1 output.wav bass -b 24
                 sox input.wav      output.wav bass -b 24 channels 1
              though the second form is more flexible as it allows the effects to be ordered arbitrarily.

       <b>-e</b> <u>ENCODING</u>, <b>--encoding</b> <u>ENCODING</u>
              The audio encoding type.  Sometimes needed with file-types that support  more  than  one  encoding
              type.  For  example, with raw, WAV, or AU (but not, for example, with MP3 or FLAC).  The available
              encoding types are as follows:

              <b>signed-integer</b>
                     PCM data stored as signed (`two's complement') integers.  Commonly used with  a  16  or  24
                     -bit encoding size.  A value of 0 represents minimum signal power.

              <b>unsigned-integer</b>
                     PCM  data stored as unsigned integers.  Commonly used with an 8-bit encoding size.  A value
                     of 0 represents maximum signal power.

              <b>floating-point</b>
                     PCM data stored as  IEEE  753  single  precision  (32-bit)  or  double  precision  (64-bit)
                     floating-point (`real') numbers.  A value of 0 represents minimum signal power.

              <b>a-law</b>  International  telephony  standard for logarithmic encoding to 8 bits per sample.  It has a
                     precision equivalent to roughly 13-bit PCM and is  sometimes  encoded  with  reversed  bit-
                     ordering (see the <b>-X</b> option).

              <b>u-law,</b> <b>mu-law</b>
                     North  American  telephony  standard for logarithmic encoding to 8 bits per sample.  A.k.a.
                     μ-law.  It has a precision equivalent to roughly 14-bit PCM and is sometimes  encoded  with
                     reversed bit-ordering (see the <b>-X</b> option).

              <b>oki-adpcm</b>
                     OKI  (a.k.a. VOX, Dialogic, or Intel) 4-bit ADPCM; it has a precision equivalent to roughly
                     12-bit PCM.  ADPCM is a form of audio compression that has a good compromise between  audio
                     quality and encoding/decoding speed.

              <b>ima-adpcm</b>
                     IMA (a.k.a. DVI) 4-bit ADPCM; it has a precision equivalent to roughly 13-bit PCM.

              <b>ms-adpcm</b>
                     Microsoft 4-bit ADPCM; it has a precision equivalent to roughly 14-bit PCM.

              <b>gsm-full-rate</b>
                     GSM  is  currently  used  for  the  vast majority of the world's digital wireless telephone
                     calls.  It utilises several audio formats with different bit-rates  and  associated  speech
                     quality.   SoX  has  support  for  GSM's  original  13kbps `Full Rate' audio format.  It is
                     usually CPU-intensive to work with GSM audio.

              Encoding names can be abbreviated where this would not be ambiguous; e.g.  `unsigned-integer'  can
              be given as `un', but not `u' (ambiguous with `u-law').

              For an input file, the most common use for this option is to inform SoX of the encoding of a `raw'
              (`headerless') audio file (see the examples in <b>-b</b> and <b>-c</b> above).

              For  an  output  file,  this option can be used (perhaps along with <b>-b</b>) to set the output encoding
              type  For example
                 sox input.cdda -e float output1.wav

                 sox input.cdda -b 64 -e float output2.wav
              convert raw CD digital audio (16-bit, signed-integer) to  floating-point  `WAV'  files  (single  &amp;
              double precision respectively).

              By  default  (i.e.  if  this  option is not given), the output encoding type will (providing it is
              supported by the output file type) be set to the input encoding type.

       <b>--no-glob</b>
              Specifies that filename `globbing' (wild-card matching) should not be  performed  by  SoX  on  the
              following  filename.   For  example,  if  the  current  directory  contains  the  two files `five-
              seconds.wav' and `five*.wav', then
                 play --no-glob "five*.wav"
              can be used to play just the single file `five*.wav'.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--rate</b> <u>RATE</u>[<b>k</b>]
              Gives the sample rate in Hz (or kHz if appended with `k') of the file.

              For an input file, the most common use for this option is to inform SoX of the sample  rate  of  a
              `raw'  (`headerless')  audio  file  (see the examples in <b>-b</b> and <b>-c</b> above).  Occasionally it may be
              useful to use this option with a `headered' file, in order to override the (presumably  incorrect)
              value  in  the header - note that this is only supported with certain file types.  For example, if
              audio was recorded with a sample-rate of say 48k from a source that  played  back  a  little,  say
              1.5%, too slowly, then
                 sox -r 48720 input.wav output.wav
              effectively corrects the speed by changing only the file header (but see also the <b>speed</b> effect for
              the more usual solution to this problem).

              For an output file, this option provides a shorthand for specifying that the <b>rate</b> effect should be
              invoked  in order to change (if necessary) the sample rate of the audio signal to the given value.
              For example, the following two commands are equivalent:
                 sox input.wav -r 48k output.wav bass -b 24
                 sox input.wav        output.wav bass -b 24 rate 48k
              though the second form is more flexible as it allows <b>rate</b> options to  be  given,  and  allows  the
              effects to be ordered arbitrarily.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--type</b> <u>FILE-TYPE</u>
              Gives  the  type of the audio file.  For both input and output files, this option is commonly used
              to inform SoX of the type a `headerless' audio file (e.g. raw, mp3) where the actual/desired  type
              cannot be determined from a given filename extension.  For example:
                 another-command | sox -t mp3 - output.wav

                 sox input.wav -t raw output.bin
              It can also be used to override the type implied by an input filename extension, but if overriding
              with a type that has a header, SoX will exit with an appropriate error message if such a header is
              not actually present.

              See <b><a href="../man7/soxformat.7.html">soxformat</a></b>(7) for a list of supported file types.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--endian</b> <b>little</b>
       <b>-B</b>, <b>--endian</b> <b>big</b>
       <b>-x</b>, <b>--endian</b> <b>swap</b>
              These  options specify whether the byte-order of the audio data is, respectively, `little endian',
              `big endian', or the opposite to that of the system  on  which  SoX  is  being  used.   Endianness
              applies  only  to  data encoded as floating-point, or as signed or unsigned integers of 16 or more
              bits.  It is often necessary to specify one of these options for headerless files,  and  sometimes
              necessary for (otherwise) self-describing files.  A given endian-setting option may be ignored for
              an  input  file whose header contains a specific endianness identifier, or for an output file that
              is actually an audio device.

              <b>N.B.</b>  Unlike other format characteristics, the endianness (byte, nibble, &amp; bit  ordering)  of  the
              input  file  is not automatically used for the output file; so, for example, when the following is
              run on a little-endian system:
                 sox -B audio.s16 trimmed.s16 trim 2
              trimmed.s16 will be created as little-endian;
                 sox -B audio.s16 -B trimmed.s16 trim 2
              must be used to preserve big-endianness in the output file.

              The <b>-V</b> option can be used to check the selected orderings.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--reverse-nibbles</b>
              Specifies that the nibble ordering (i.e. the 2  halves  of  a  byte)  of  the  samples  should  be
              reversed; sometimes useful with ADPCM-based formats.

              <b>N.B.</b>  See also N.B. in section on <b>-x</b> above.

       <b>-X</b>, <b>--reverse-bits</b>
              Specifies  that  the  bit  ordering of the samples should be reversed; sometimes useful with a few
              (mostly headerless) formats.

              <b>N.B.</b>  See also N.B. in section on <b>-x</b> above.

   <b>Output</b> <b>File</b> <b>Format</b> <b>Options</b>
       These options apply only to the output file and may precede only the output filename on the command line.

       <b>--add-comment</b> <u>TEXT</u>
              Append a comment in the output file header (where applicable).

       <b>--comment</b> <u>TEXT</u>
              Specify the comment text to store in the output file header (where applicable).

              SoX will provide a default comment if this option (or <b>--comment-file</b>) is  not  given.  To  specify
              that no comment should be stored in the output file, use <b>--comment</b> <b>""</b> <b>.</b>

       <b>--comment-file</b> <u>FILENAME</u>
              Specify a file containing the comment text to store in the output file header (where applicable).

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--compression</b> <u>FACTOR</u>
              The  compression factor for variably compressing output file formats.  If this option is not given
              then a default compression factor will apply.  The compression factor is  interpreted  differently
              for  different  compressing  file  formats.  See the description of the file formats that use this
              option in <b><a href="../man7/soxformat.7.html">soxformat</a></b>(7) for more information.

</pre><h4><b>EFFECTS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to converting, playing and recording audio files, SoX can be used to invoke a number of audio
       `effects'.  Multiple effects may be applied by specifying them one after another at the end  of  the  SoX
       command  line,  forming  an `effects chain'.  Note that applying multiple effects in real-time (i.e. when
       playing audio) is likely to  require  a  high  performance  computer.  Stopping  other  applications  may
       alleviate performance issues should they occur.

       Some  of  the  SoX  effects  are  primarily intended to be applied to a single instrument or `voice'.  To
       facilitate this, the <b>remix</b> effect and the global SoX option <b>-M</b> can be  used  to  isolate  then  recombine
       tracks from a multi-track recording.

   <b>Multiple</b> <b>Effects</b> <b>Chains</b>
       A  single  effects  chain is made up of one or more effects.  Audio from the input runs through the chain
       until either the end of the input file is reached or an effect in the chain  requests  to  terminate  the
       chain.

       SoX  supports  running  multiple  effects  chains  over  the  input  audio.  In this case, when one chain
       indicates it is done processing audio, the audio data is then sent through the next effects chain.   This
       continues until either no more effects chains exist or the input has reached the end of the file.

       An  effects chain is terminated by placing a <b>:</b> (colon) after an effect.  Any following effects are a part
       of a new effects chain.

       It is important to place the effect that will stop the chain as the first effect in the chain.   This  is
       because any samples that are buffered by effects to the left of the terminating effect will be discarded.
       The  amount  of samples discarded is related to the <b>--buffer</b> option and it should be kept small, relative
       to the sample rate, if the terminating effect cannot be first.  Further information on  stopping  effects
       can be found in the <b>Stopping</b> <b>SoX</b> section.

       There  are a few pseudo-effects that aid using multiple effects chains.  These include <b>newfile</b> which will
       start writing to a new output file before moving to the next effects chain and <b>restart</b>  which  will  move
       back  to the first effects chain.  Pseudo-effects must be specified as the first effect in a chain and as
       the only effect in a chain (they must have a <b>:</b> before and after they are specified).

       The following is an example of multiple effects chains.  It will split the input file into multiple files
       of 30 seconds in length.  Each output filename will have unique number in its name as documented  in  the
       <b>Output</b> <b>Files</b> section.
          sox infile.wav output.wav trim 0 30 : newfile : restart

   <b>Common</b> <b>Notation</b> <b>And</b> <b>Parameters</b>
       In the descriptions that follow, brackets [ ] are used to denote parameters that are optional, braces { }
       to  denote  those  that are both optional and repeatable, and angle brackets &lt; &gt; to denote those that are
       repeatable but not optional.  Where applicable, default values  for  optional  parameters  are  shown  in
       parenthesis ( ).

       The following parameters are used with, and have the same meaning for, several effects:

       <u>center</u>[<b>k</b>]
              See <u>frequency</u>.

       <u>frequency</u>[<b>k</b>]
              A frequency in Hz, or, if appended with `k', kHz.

       <u>gain</u>   A power gain in dB.  Zero gives no gain; less than zero gives an attenuation.

       <u>position</u>
              A  position  within  the  audio  stream;  the  syntax is [<b>=</b>|<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>]<u>timespec</u>, where <u>timespec</u> is a time
              specification (see below).  The optional first character indicates whether the <u>timespec</u> is  to  be
              interpreted  relative  to  the  start  (<b>=</b>) or end (<b>-</b>) of audio, or to the previous <u>position</u> if the
              effect accepts multiple position arguments (<b>+</b>).  The audio length must be known  for  end-relative
              locations  to  work;  some  effects  do  accept <b>-0</b> for end-of-audio, though, even if the length is
              unknown.  Which of <b>=</b>, <b>+</b>, <b>-</b> is the default depends on the effect and is shown  in  its  syntax  as,
              e.g., <u>position(+)</u>.

              Examples:  <b>=2:00</b> (two minutes into the audio stream), <b>-100s</b> (one hundred samples before the end of
              audio), <b>+0:12+10s</b> (twelve seconds and ten samples  after  the  previous  position),  <b>-0.5+1s</b>  (one
              sample less than half a second before the end of audio).

       <u>width</u>[<b>h</b>|<b>k</b>|<b>o</b>|<b>q</b>]
              Used  to  specify  the band-width of a filter.  A number of different methods to specify the width
              are available (though not all for every effect).  One of the characters shown may be  appended  to
              select the desired method as follows:
                                                         <u>Method</u>    <u>Notes</u>
                                                    <b>h</b>      Hz
                                                    <b>k</b>     kHz
                                                    <b>o</b>   Octaves
                                                    <b>q</b>   Q-factor   See [2]

              For each effect that uses this parameter, the default method (i.e. if no character is appended) is
              the one that it listed first in the first line of the effect's description.

       Most  effects that expect an audio position or duration in a parameter, i.e. a <b>time</b> <b>specification</b>, accept
       either of the following two forms:

       [[<u>hours</u><b>:</b>]<u>minutes</u><b>:</b>]<u>seconds</u>[<b>.</b><u>frac</u>][<b>t</b>]
              A specification of `1:30.5' corresponds to one minute, thirty and ½  seconds.   The  <b>t</b>  suffix  is
              entirely  optional  (however,  see  the <b>silence</b> effect for an exception).  Note that the component
              values do not have to be normalized; e.g., `1:23:45', `83:45',  `79:0285',  `1:0:1425',  `1::1425'
              and `5025' all are legal and equivalent to each other.

       <u>samples</u><b>s</b>
              Specifies  the  number of samples directly, as in `8000s'.  For large sample counts, <u>e</u> <u>notation</u> is
              supported: `1.7e6s' is the same as `1700000s'.

       Time specifications can also be chained with <b>+</b> or <b>-</b> into a new time specification where the right part is
       added to or subtracted from the left, respectively: `3:00-200s' means two hundred samples less than three
       minutes.

       To see if SoX has support for an optional effect, enter <b>sox</b> <b>-h</b> and look for  its  name  under  the  list:
       `EFFECTS'.

   <b>Supported</b> <b>Effects</b>
       Note: a categorised list of the effects can be found in the accompanying `README' file.

       <b>allpass</b> <u>frequency</u>[<b>k</b>] <u>width</u>[<b>h</b>|<b>k</b>|<b>o</b>|<b>q</b>]
              Apply a two-pole all-pass filter with central frequency (in Hz) <u>frequency</u>, and filter-width <u>width</u>.
              An  all-pass  filter  changes  the  audio's  frequency  to phase relationship without changing its
              frequency to amplitude relationship.  The filter is described in detail in [1].

              This effect supports the <b>--plot</b> global option.

       <b>band</b> [<b>-n</b>] <u>center</u>[<b>k</b>] [<u>width</u>[<b>h</b>|<b>k</b>|<b>o</b>|<b>q</b>]]
              Apply a band-pass  filter.   The  frequency  response  drops  logarithmically  around  the  <u>center</u>
              frequency.   The  <u>width</u>  parameter gives the slope of the drop.  The frequencies at <u>center</u> + <u>width</u>
              and <u>center</u> - <u>width</u> will be half of their original amplitudes.  <b>band</b> defaults to a mode oriented to
              pitched audio, i.e. voice, singing, or instrumental music.  The <b>-n</b> (for  noise)  option  uses  the
              alternate  mode  for  un-pitched  audio (e.g. percussion).  <b>Warning:</b> <b>-n</b> introduces a power-gain of
              about 11dB in the filter, so beware of output clipping.  <b>band</b> introduces noise in the shape of the
              filter, i.e. peaking at the <u>center</u> frequency and settling around it.

              This effect supports the <b>--plot</b> global option.

              See also <b>sinc</b> for a bandpass filter with steeper shoulders.

       <b>bandpass</b>|<b>bandreject</b> [<b>-c</b>] <u>frequency</u>[<b>k</b>] <u>width</u>[<b>h</b>|<b>k</b>|<b>o</b>|<b>q</b>]
              Apply a two-pole Butterworth band-pass or band-reject filter with central frequency <u>frequency</u>, and
              (3dB-point) band-width <u>width</u>.  The <b>-c</b> option applies only to <b>bandpass</b> and selects a constant skirt
              gain (peak gain = Q) instead of the default: constant 0dB peak gain.  The filters roll off at  6dB
              per octave (20dB per decade) and are described in detail in [1].

              These effects support the <b>--plot</b> global option.

              See also <b>sinc</b> for a bandpass filter with steeper shoulders.

       <b>bandreject</b> <u>frequency</u>[<b>k</b>] <u>width</u>[<b>h</b>|<b>k</b>|<b>o</b>|<b>q</b>]
              Apply a band-reject filter.  See the description of the <b>bandpass</b> effect for details.

       <b>bass</b>|<b>treble</b> <u>gain</u> [<u>frequency</u>[<b>k</b>] [<u>width</u>[<b>s</b>|<b>h</b>|<b>k</b>|<b>o</b>|<b>q</b>]]]
              Boost or cut the bass (lower) or treble (upper) frequencies of the audio using a two-pole shelving
              filter with a response similar to that of a standard hi-fi's tone-controls.  This is also known as
              shelving equalisation (EQ).

              <u>gain</u>  gives  the  gain  at  0 Hz  (for <b>bass</b>), or whichever is the lower of ∼22 kHz and the Nyquist
              frequency (for <b>treble</b>).  Its useful range is about -20 (for a large  cut)  to  +20  (for  a  large
              boost).  Beware of <b>Clipping</b> when using a positive <u>gain</u>.

              If desired, the filter can be fine-tuned using the following optional parameters:

              <u>frequency</u> sets the filter's central frequency and so can be used to extend or reduce the frequency
              range to be boosted or cut.  The default value is 100 Hz (for <b>bass</b>) or 3 kHz (for <b>treble</b>).

              <u>width</u>  determines  how  steep  is  the filter's shelf transition.  In addition to the common width
              specification methods described above, `slope' (the default, or if appended with `<b>s</b>') may be used.
              The useful range of `slope' is about 0.3, for a gentle slope, to 1  (the  maximum),  for  a  steep
              slope; the default value is 0.5.

              The filters are described in detail in [1].

              These effects support the <b>--plot</b> global option.

              See also <b>equalizer</b> for a peaking equalisation effect.

       <b>bend</b> [<b>-f</b> <u><a href="../man25/frame-rate.25.html">frame-rate</a></u>(25)] [<b>-o</b> <u><a href="../man16/over-sample.16.html">over-sample</a></u>(16)] { <u>start-position(+)</u><b>,</b><u>cents</u><b>,</b><u>end-position(+)</u> }
              Changes   pitch   by   specified   amounts   at   specified  times.   Each  given  triple:  <u>start-</u>
              <u>position</u><b>,</b><u>cents</u><b>,</b><u>end-position</u> specifies one bend.  <u>cents</u> is the number  of  cents  (100  cents  =  1
              semitone)  by  which  to  bend  the pitch. The other values specify the points in time at which to
              start and end bending the pitch, respectively.

              The pitch-bending algorithm utilises the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) at  a  particular  frame
              rate  and over-sampling rate.  The <b>-f</b> and <b>-o</b> parameters may be used to adjust these parameters and
              thus control the smoothness of the changes in pitch.

              For example, an initial tone is generated, then bent three times, yielding four different notes in
              total:
                 play -n synth 2.5 sin 667 gain 1 \
                   bend .35,180,.25  .15,740,.53  0,-520,.3
              Here, the first bend runs from 0.35 to 0.6, and the second one from 0.75 to  1.28  seconds.   Note
              that  the  clipping  that  is produced in this example is deliberate; to remove it, use <b>gain</b> <b>-5</b> in
              place of <b>gain</b> <b>1</b>.

              See also <b>pitch</b>.

       <b>biquad</b> <u>b0</u> <u>b1</u> <u>b2</u> <u>a0</u> <u>a1</u> <u>a2</u>
              Apply a biquad IIR filter with the given coefficients. Where b*  and  a*  are  the  numerator  and
              denominator coefficients respectively.

              See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_biquad_filter">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_biquad_filter</a> (where a0 = 1).

              This effect supports the <b>--plot</b> global option.

       <b>channels</b> <u>CHANNELS</u>
              Invoke a simple algorithm to change the number of channels in the audio signal to the given number
              <u>CHANNELS</u>:  mixing  if decreasing the number of channels or duplicating if increasing the number of
              channels.

              The <b>channels</b> effect is invoked automatically if SoX's <b>-c</b> option specifies  a  number  of  channels
              that  is  different  to  that  of  the  input  file(s).   Alternatively,  if  this effect is given
              explicitly, then SoX's <b>-c</b> option need not be given.  For example, the following two  commands  are
              equivalent:
                 sox input.wav -c 1 output.wav bass -b 24
                 sox input.wav      output.wav bass -b 24 channels 1
              though the second form is more flexible as it allows the effects to be ordered arbitrarily.

              See also <b>remix</b> for an effect that allows channels to be mixed/selected arbitrarily.

       <b>chorus</b> <u>gain-in</u> <u>gain-out</u> &lt;<u>delay</u> <u>decay</u> <u>speed</u> <u>depth</u> <b>-s</b>|<b>-t</b>&gt;
              Add  a chorus effect to the audio.  This can make a single vocal sound like a chorus, but can also
              be applied to instrumentation.

              Chorus resembles an echo effect with a short delay, but whereas with echo the delay  is  constant,
              with chorus, it is varied using sinusoidal or triangular modulation.  The modulation depth defines
              the  range  the  modulated delay is played before or after the delay. Hence the delayed sound will
              sound slower or faster, that is the delayed sound tuned around the original one, like in a  chorus
              where some vocals are slightly off key.  See [3] for more discussion of the chorus effect.

              Each  four-tuple  parameter  delay/decay/speed/depth gives the delay in milliseconds and the decay
              (relative to gain-in) with a modulation speed in Hz using depth in milliseconds.   The  modulation
              is either sinusoidal (<b>-s</b>) or triangular (<b>-t</b>).  Gain-out is the volume of the output.

              A  typical  delay  is  around  40ms  to  60ms;  the  modulation  speed is best near 0.25Hz and the
              modulation depth around 2ms.  For example, a single delay:
                 play guitar1.wav chorus 0.7 0.9 55 0.4 0.25 2 -t
              Two delays of the original samples:
                 play guitar1.wav chorus 0.6 0.9 50 0.4 0.25 2 -t \
                    60 0.32 0.4 1.3 -s
              A fuller sounding chorus (with three additional delays):
                 play guitar1.wav chorus 0.5 0.9 50 0.4 0.25 2 -t \
                    60 0.32 0.4 2.3 -t 40 0.3 0.3 1.3 -s

       <b>compand</b> <u>attack1</u><b>,</b><u>decay1</u>{<b>,</b><u>attack2</u><b>,</b><u>decay2</u>}
              [<u>soft-knee-dB</u><b>:</b>]<u>in-dB1</u>[<b>,</b><u>out-dB1</u>]{<b>,</b><u>in-dB2</u><b>,</b><u>out-dB2</u>}
              [<u>gain</u> [<u>initial-volume-dB</u> [<u>delay</u>]]]

              Compand (compress or expand) the dynamic range of the audio.

              The <u>attack</u> and <u>decay</u> parameters (in seconds) determine the time over which the instantaneous level
              of the input signal is averaged to determine its volume; attacks refer to increases in volume  and
              decays  refer  to  decreases.  For most situations, the attack time (response to the music getting
              louder) should be shorter than the decay time because the human ear is more  sensitive  to  sudden
              loud  music  than  sudden  soft  music.   Where  more than one pair of attack/decay parameters are
              specified, each input channel is companded separately and the number of pairs must agree with  the
              number of input channels.  Typical values are <b>0.3,0.8</b> seconds.

              The  second  parameter  is  a  list of points on the compander's transfer function specified in dB
              relative to the maximum possible signal amplitude.   The  input  values  must  be  in  a  strictly
              increasing  order but the transfer function does not have to be monotonically rising.  If omitted,
              the value of <u>out-dB1</u> defaults to the same value as <u>in-dB1</u>; levels below <u>in-dB1</u> are  not  companded
              (but  may  have  gain applied to them).  The point <b>0,0</b> is assumed but may be overridden (by <b>0,</b><u>out-</u>
              <u>dBn</u>).  If the list is preceded by a <u>soft-knee-dB</u> value, then the points  at  where  adjacent  line
              segments  on  the  transfer function meet will be rounded by the amount given.  Typical values for
              the transfer function are <b>6:-70,-60,-20</b>.

              The third (optional) parameter is an additional gain in dB to be applied  at  all  points  on  the
              transfer function and allows easy adjustment of the overall gain.

              The fourth (optional) parameter is an initial level to be assumed for each channel when companding
              starts.   This  permits the user to supply a nominal level initially, so that, for example, a very
              large gain is not applied to initial signal levels before  the  companding  action  has  begun  to
              operate:  it  is  quite probable that in such an event, the output would be severely clipped while
              the compander gain properly adjusts itself.  A typical value (for audio which is initially  quiet)
              is <b>-90</b> dB.

              The fifth (optional) parameter is a delay in seconds.  The input signal is analysed immediately to
              control  the  compander,  but it is delayed before being fed to the volume adjuster.  Specifying a
              delay approximately equal to the attack/decay times allows the compander to effectively operate in
              a `predictive' rather than a reactive mode.  A typical value is <b>0.2</b> seconds.
                                                     *        *        *

              The following example might be used to make a piece of music with both  quiet  and  loud  passages
              suitable for listening to in a noisy environment such as a moving vehicle:
                 sox asz.wav asz-car.wav compand 0.3,1 6:-70,-60,-20 -5 -90 0.2
              The  transfer  function  (`6:-70,...')  says  that  very  soft  sounds  (below  -70dB) will remain
              unchanged.  This will stop the compander from boosting the volume on  `silent'  passages  such  as
              between  movements.  However, sounds in the range -60dB to 0dB (maximum volume) will be boosted so
              that the 60dB dynamic range of the original music will be compressed 3-to-1  into  a  20dB  range,
              which  is wide enough to enjoy the music but narrow enough to get around the road noise.  The `6:'
              selects 6dB soft-knee companding.  The -5 (dB) output gain is needed to avoid clipping (the number
              is inexact, and was derived by experimentation).  The -90 (dB) for the initial  volume  will  work
              fine  for  a  clip that starts with near silence, and the delay of 0.2 (seconds) has the effect of
              causing the compander to react a bit more quickly to sudden volume changes.

              In the next example, compand is being used as a noise-gate for when the noise is at a lower  level
              than the signal:
                 play infile compand .1,.2 -inf,-50.1,-inf,-50,-50 0 -90 .1
              Here  is  another  noise-gate,  this  time for when the noise is at a higher level than the signal
              (making it, in some ways, similar to squelch):
                 play infile compand .1,.1 -45.1,-45,-inf,0,-inf 45 -90 .1
              This effect supports the <b>--plot</b> global option (for the transfer function).

              See also <b>mcompand</b> for a multiple-band companding effect.

       <b>contrast</b> [<u><a href="../man75/enhancement-amount.75.html">enhancement-amount</a></u>(75)]
              Comparable with compression, this effect modifies  an  audio  signal  to  make  it  sound  louder.
              <u>enhancement-amount</u>  controls  the  amount  of  the enhancement and is a number in the range 0-100.
              Note that <u>enhancement-amount</u> = 0 still gives a significant contrast enhancement.

              See also the <b>compand</b> and <b>mcompand</b> effects.

       <b>dcshift</b> <u>shift</u> [<u>limitergain</u>]
              Apply a DC shift to the audio.  This can be useful to remove a DC  offset  (caused  perhaps  by  a
              hardware  problem  in  the  recording chain) from the audio.  The effect of a DC offset is reduced
              headroom and hence volume.  The <b>stat</b> or <b>stats</b> effect can be used to determine if a signal has a DC
              offset.

              The given <u>dcshift</u> value is a floating point number in the range of ±2 that indicates the amount to
              shift the audio (which is in the range of ±1).

              An optional <u>limitergain</u> can be specified as well.  It should have a value much less than  1  (e.g.
              0.05 or 0.02) and is used only on peaks to prevent clipping.
                                                     *        *        *

              An alternative approach to removing a DC offset (albeit with a short delay) is to use the <b>highpass</b>
              filter effect at a frequency of say 10Hz, as illustrated in the following example:
                 sox -n dc.wav synth 5 sin %0 50
                 sox dc.wav fixed.wav highpass 10

       <b>deemph</b> Apply Compact Disc (IEC 60908) de-emphasis (a treble attenuation shelving filter).

              Pre-emphasis  was  applied in the mastering of some CDs issued in the early 1980s.  These included
              many classical music albums, as well as now sought-after issues of albums  by  The  Beatles,  Pink
              Floyd  and others.  Pre-emphasis should be removed at playback time by a de-emphasis filter in the
              playback device.  However, not all modern CD players have this filter, and very few PC  CD  drives
              have it; playing pre-emphasised audio without the correct de-emphasis filter results in audio that
              sounds harsh and is far from what its creators intended.

              With  the  <b>deemph</b> effect, it is possible to apply the necessary de-emphasis to audio that has been
              extracted from a pre-emphasised CD, and then either burn the  de-emphasised  audio  to  a  new  CD
              (which  will  then  play  correctly  on any CD player), or simply play the correctly de-emphasised
              audio files on the PC.  For example:
                 sox track1.wav track1-deemph.wav deemph
              and then burn track1-deemph.wav to CD, or
                 play track1-deemph.wav
              or simply
                 play track1.wav deemph
              The de-emphasis filter is implemented as a biquad and requires the input audio sample rate  to  be
              either 44.1kHz or 48kHz.  Maximum deviation from the ideal response is only 0.06dB (up to 20kHz).

              This effect supports the <b>--plot</b> global option.

              See also the <b>bass</b> and <b>treble</b> shelving equalisation effects.

       <b>delay</b> {<u>position(=)</u>}
              Delay  one  or more audio channels such that they start at the given <u>position</u>.  For example, <b>delay</b>
              <b>1.5</b> <b>+1</b> <b>3000s</b> delays the first channel by 1.5 seconds, the  second  channel  by  2.5  seconds  (one
              second  more  than  the previous channel), the third channel by 3000 samples, and leaves any other
              channels that may be present un-delayed.  The following (one long) command plays a chime sound:
                 play -n synth -j 3 sin %3 sin %-2 sin %-5 sin %-9 \
                   sin %-14 sin %-21 fade h .01 2 1.5 delay \
                   1.3 1 .76 .54 .27 remix - fade h 0 2.7 2.5 norm -1
              and this plays a guitar chord:
                 play -n synth pl G2 pl B2 pl D3 pl G3 pl D4 pl G4 \
                   delay 0 .05 .1 .15 .2 .25 remix - fade 0 4 .1 norm -1

       <b>dither</b> [<b>-S</b>|<b>-s</b>|<b>-f</b> <u>filter</u>] [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-p</b> <u>precision</u>]
              Apply dithering to the audio.  Dithering deliberately adds a small amount of noise to  the  signal
              in  order  to  mask  audible quantization effects that can occur if the output sample size is less
              than 24 bits.  With no options, this effect will add triangular (TPDF) white noise.  Noise-shaping
              (only for certain sample rates) can be selected with <b>-s</b>.  With the <b>-f</b> option, it  is  possible  to
              select  a particular noise-shaping filter from the following list: lipshitz, f-weighted, modified-
              e-weighted, improved-e-weighted, gesemann, shibata, low-shibata,  high-shibata.   Note  that  most
              filter  types  are available only with 44100Hz sample rate.  The filter types are distinguished by
              the following properties: audibility of noise, level of (inaudible,  but  in  some  circumstances,
              otherwise problematic) shaped high frequency noise, and processing speed.
              See <a href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/SoX/NoiseShaping">http://sox.sourceforge.net/SoX/NoiseShaping</a> for graphs of the different noise-shaping curves.

              The <b>-S</b> option selects a slightly `sloped' TPDF, biased towards higher frequencies.  It can be used
              at any sampling rate but below ≈22k, plain TPDF is probably better, and above ≈ 37k, noise-shaping
              (if available) is probably better.

              The  <b>-a</b>  option enables a mode where dithering (and noise-shaping if applicable) are automatically
              enabled only when needed.  The most likely use for this is when applying fade  in  or  out  to  an
              already  dithered file, so that the redithering applies only to the faded portions.  However, auto
              dithering is not fool-proof, so the fades should be carefully checked for any noise modulation; if
              this occurs, then either re-dither the whole file, or use <b>trim</b>, <b>fade</b>, and concatencate.

              The <b>-p</b> option allows overriding the target precision.

              If the SoX global option <b>-R</b> option is not given, then the pseudo-random number generator  used  to
              generate  the  white  noise will be `reseeded', i.e. the generated noise will be different between
              invocations.

              This effect should not be followed by any other effect that affects the audio.

              See also the `Dithering' section above.

       <b>downsample</b> [<u><a href="../man2/factor.2.html">factor</a></u>(2)]
              Downsample the signal by an integer factor: Only the first out of each <u>factor</u> samples is retained,
              the others are discarded.

              No decimation filter is applied.  If the input is not  a  properly  bandlimited  baseband  signal,
              aliasing will occur.  This may be desirable, e.g., for frequency translation.

              For a general resampling effect with anti-aliasing, see <b>rate</b>.  See also <b>upsample</b>.

       <b>earwax</b> Makes  audio  easier  to  listen  to  on headphones.  Adds `cues' to 44.1kHz stereo (i.e. audio CD
              format) audio so that when listened to on headphones the stereo image is moved  from  inside  your
              head (standard for headphones) to outside and in front of the listener (standard for speakers).

       <b>echo</b> <u>gain-in</u> <u>gain-out</u> &lt;<u>delay</u> <u>decay</u>&gt;
              Add  echoing  to  the audio.  Echoes are reflected sound and can occur naturally amongst mountains
              (and sometimes large buildings) when talking  or  shouting;  digital  echo  effects  emulate  this
              behaviour and are often used to help fill out the sound of a single instrument or vocal.  The time
              difference  between the original signal and the reflection is the `delay' (time), and the loudness
              of the reflected signal is the `decay'.  Multiple echoes can have different delays and decays.

              Each given <u>delay</u> <u>decay</u> pair gives the delay in milliseconds and the decay (relative to gain-in) of
              that echo.  Gain-out is the volume of the output.  For example: This will  make  it  sound  as  if
              there are twice as many instruments as are actually playing:
                 play lead.aiff echo 0.8 0.88 60 0.4
              If the delay is very short, then it sound like a (metallic) robot playing music:
                 play lead.aiff echo 0.8 0.88 6 0.4
              A longer delay will sound like an open air concert in the mountains:
                 play lead.aiff echo 0.8 0.9 1000 0.3
              One mountain more, and:
                 play lead.aiff echo 0.8 0.9 1000 0.3 1800 0.25

       <b>echos</b> <u>gain-in</u> <u>gain-out</u> &lt;<u>delay</u> <u>decay</u>&gt;
              Add  a sequence of echoes to the audio.  Each <u>delay</u> <u>decay</u> pair gives the delay in milliseconds and
              the decay (relative to gain-in) of that echo.  Gain-out is the volume of the output.

              Like the echo effect, echos stand for `ECHO in Sequel', that is the first echos takes  the  input,
              the  second the input and the first echos, the third the input and the first and the second echos,
              ... and so on.  Care should be taken using many echos; a single echos has the  same  effect  as  a
              single echo.

              The sample will be bounced twice in symmetric echos:
                 play lead.aiff echos 0.8 0.7 700 0.25 700 0.3
              The sample will be bounced twice in asymmetric echos:
                 play lead.aiff echos 0.8 0.7 700 0.25 900 0.3
              The sample will sound as if played in a garage:
                 play lead.aiff echos 0.8 0.7 40 0.25 63 0.3

       <b>equalizer</b> <u>frequency</u>[<b>k</b>] <u>width</u>[<b>q</b>|<b>o</b>|<b>h</b>|<b>k</b>] <u>gain</u>
              Apply  a  two-pole  peaking  equalisation  (EQ) filter.  With this filter, the signal-level at and
              around a selected frequency can be increased or decreased,  whilst  (unlike  band-pass  and  band-
              reject filters) that at all other frequencies is unchanged.

              <u>frequency</u> gives the filter's central frequency in Hz, <u>width</u>, the band-width, and <u>gain</u> the required
              gain or attenuation in dB.  Beware of <b>Clipping</b> when using a positive <u>gain</u>.

              In order to produce complex equalisation curves, this effect can be given several times, each with
              a different central frequency.

              The filter is described in detail in [1].

              This effect supports the <b>--plot</b> global option.

              See also <b>bass</b> and <b>treble</b> for shelving equalisation effects.

       <b>fade</b> [<u>type</u>] <u>fade-in-length</u> [<u>stop-position(=)</u> [<u>fade-out-length</u>]]
              Apply a fade effect to the beginning, end, or both of the audio.

              An  optional  <u>type</u> can be specified to select the shape of the fade curve: <b>q</b> for quarter of a sine
              wave, <b>h</b> for half a sine wave, <b>t</b> for linear (`triangular') slope, <b>l</b>  for  logarithmic,  and  <b>p</b>  for
              inverted parabola.  The default is logarithmic.

              A  fade-in  starts from the first sample and ramps the signal level from 0 to full volume over the
              time given as <u>fade-in-length</u>.  Specify 0 if no fade-in is wanted.

              For fade-outs, the audio will be truncated at <u>stop-position</u> and the signal level  will  be  ramped
              from full volume down to 0 over an interval of <u>fade-out-length</u> before the <u>stop-position</u>.  If <u>fade-</u>
              <u>out-length</u>  is  not  specified,  it  defaults to the same value as <u>fade-in-length</u>.  No fade-out is
              performed if <u>stop-position</u> is not specified.  If the audio length can be determined from the input
              file header and any previous effects, then <b>-0</b> (or, for historical reasons, <b>0</b>) may be specified for
              <u>stop-position</u> to indicate the usual case of a fade-out that ends at the end  of  the  input  audio
              stream.

              Any time specification may be used for <u>fade-in-length</u> and <u>fade-out-length</u>.

              See also the <b>splice</b> effect.

       <b>fir</b> [<u>coefs-file</u>|<u>coefs</u>]
              Use  SoX's  FFT  convolution  engine  with given FIR filter coefficients.  If a single argument is
              given then this is treated as the name of a file containing the filter  coefficients  (white-space
              separated;  may  contain `#' comments).  If the given filename is `-', or if no argument is given,
              then the coefficients are read from the `standard input' (stdin); otherwise, coefficients  may  be
              given on the command line.  Examples:

       <b>gain</b> [<b>-e</b>|<b>-B</b>|<b>-b</b>|<b>-r</b>] [<b>-n</b>] [<b>-l</b>|<b>-h</b>] [<u>gain-dB</u>]
              Apply  amplification  or  attenuation  to  the  audio  signal,  or,  in some cases, to some of its
              channels.  Note that use of any of <b>-e</b>, <b>-B</b>, <b>-b</b>, <b>-r</b>, or <b>-n</b> requires temporary file  space  to  store
              the audio to be processed, so may be unsuitable for use with `streamed' audio.

              Without other options, <u>gain-dB</u> is used to adjust the signal power level by the given number of dB:
              positive  amplifies  (beware  of  Clipping), negative attenuates.  With other options, the <u>gain-dB</u>
              amplification or attenuation is (logically) applied after the processing due to those options.

              Given the <b>-e</b> option, the levels of the audio channels of a  multi-channel  file  are  `equalised',
              i.e.   gain  is applied to all channels other than that with the highest peak level, such that all
              channels attain the same peak level (but, without also giving <b>-n</b>, the audio is not `normalised').

              The <b>-B</b> (balance) option is similar to <b>-e</b>, but with <b>-B,</b> the RMS level is used instead of  the  peak
              level.   <b>-B</b>  might  be  used  to  correct stereo imbalance caused by an imperfect record turntable
              cartridge.   Note that unlike <b>-e</b>, <b>-B</b> might cause some clipping.

              <b>-b</b> is similar to <b>-B</b> but has clipping protection, i.e.  if necessary  to  prevent  clipping  whilst
              balancing, attenuation is applied to all channels.  Note, however, that in conjunction with <b>-n</b>, <b>-B</b>
              and <b>-b</b> are synonymous.

              The  <b>-r</b>  option  is  used  in conjunction with a prior invocation of <b>gain</b> with the <b>-h</b> option - see
              below for details.

              The <b>-n</b> option normalises the audio to 0dB FSD; it is often used in  conjunction  with  a  negative
              <u>gain-dB</u> to the effect that the audio is normalised to a given level below 0dB.  For example,
                 sox infile outfile gain -n
              normalises to 0dB, and
                 sox infile outfile gain -n -3
              normalises to -3dB.

              The <b>-l</b> option invokes a simple limiter, e.g.
                 sox infile outfile gain -l 6
              will  apply  6dB  of  gain  but  never  clip.   Note  that  limiting more than a few dBs more than
              occasionally (in a piece of audio) is not recommended as it can cause audible distortion.  See the
              <b>compand</b> effect for a more capable limiter.

              The <b>-h</b> option is used to apply gain to provide head-room for subsequent processing.  For  example,
              with
                 sox infile outfile gain -h bass +6
              6dB  of  attenuation  will be applied prior to the bass boosting effect thus ensuring that it will
              not clip.  Of course, with bass, it is obvious how much headroom will be needed,  but  with  other
              effects (e.g.  rate, dither) it is not always as clear.  Another advantage of using <b>gain</b> <b>-h</b> rather
              than an explicit attenuation, is that if the headroom is not used by subsequent effects, it can be
              reclaimed with <b>gain</b> <b>-r</b>, for example:
                 sox infile outfile gain -h bass +6 rate 44100 gain -r
              The  above  effects  chain  guarantees  never  to  clip nor amplify; it attenuates if necessary to
              prevent clipping, but by only as much as is needed to do so.

              Output formatting (dithering and bit-depth reduction) also  requires  headroom  (which  cannot  be
              `reclaimed'), e.g.
                 sox infile outfile gain -h bass +6 rate 44100 gain -rh dither
              Here,  the  second  <b>gain</b> invocation, reclaims as much of the headroom as it can from the preceding
              effects, but retains as much headroom as is needed for  subsequent  processing.   The  SoX  global
              option <b>-G</b> can be given to automatically invoke <b>gain</b> <b>-h</b> and <b>gain</b> <b>-r</b>.

              See also the <b>norm</b> and <b>vol</b> effects.

       <b>highpass</b>|<b>lowpass</b> [<b>-1</b>|<b>-2</b>] <u>frequency</u>[<b>k</b>] [width[<b>q</b>|<b>o</b>|<b>h</b>|<b>k</b>]]
              Apply  a  high-pass or low-pass filter with 3dB point <u>frequency</u>.  The filter can be either single-
              pole (with <b>-1</b>), or double-pole (the default, or with  <b>-2</b>).   <u>width</u>  applies  only  to  double-pole
              filters;  the  default is Q = 0.707 and gives a Butterworth response.  The filters roll off at 6dB
              per pole per octave (20dB per pole per decade).  The double-pole filters are described  in  detail
              in [1].

              These effects support the <b>--plot</b> global option.

              See also <b>sinc</b> for filters with a steeper roll-off.

       <b>hilbert</b> [<b>-n</b> <u>taps</u>]
              Apply an odd-tap Hilbert transform filter, phase-shifting the signal by 90 degrees.

              This  is  used  in  many matrix coding schemes and for analytic signal generation.  The process is
              often written as a multiplication by <u>i</u> (or <u>j</u>), the imaginary unit.

              An odd-tap Hilbert transform filter has a bandpass  characteristic,  attenuating  the  lowest  and
              highest  frequencies.   Its bandwidth can be controlled by the number of filter taps, which can be
              specified with <b>-n</b>.  By default, the number of taps is chosen for a cutoff frequency  of  about  75
              Hz.

              This effect supports the <b>--plot</b> global option.

       <b>ladspa</b> [<b>-l</b>|<b>-r</b>] <u>module</u> [<u>plugin</u>] [<u>argument</u> ...]
              Apply  a  LADSPA [5] (Linux Audio Developer's Simple Plugin API) plugin.  Despite the name, LADSPA
              is not Linux-specific, and a wide range of effects is available as LADSPA plugins, such as cmt [6]
              (the Computer Music Toolkit) and Steve Harris's plugin collection [7]. The first argument  is  the
              plugin  module, the second the name of the plugin (a module can contain more than one plugin), and
              any other arguments are for the control ports of the plugin. Missing  arguments  are  supplied  by
              default values if possible.

              Normally, the number of input ports of the plugin must match the number of input channels, and the
              number  of  output  ports determines the output channel count.  However, the <b>-r</b> (replicate) option
              allows cloning a mono plugin to handle multi-channel input.

              Some plugins introduce  latency  which  SoX  may  optionally  compensate  for.   The  <b>-l</b>  (latency
              compensation) option automatically compensates for latency as reported by the plugin via an output
              control port named "latency".

              If found, the environment variable LADSPA_PATH will be used as search path for plugins.

       <b>loudness</b> [<u>gain</u> [<u>reference</u>]]
              Loudness  control  -  similar to the <b>gain</b> effect, but provides equalisation for the human auditory
              system.  See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness</a> for a detailed description  of  loudness.   The
              gain is adjusted by the given <u>gain</u> parameter (usually negative) and the signal equalised according
              to ISO 226 w.r.t. a reference level of 65dB, though an alternative <u>reference</u> level may be given if
              the  original  audio  has been equalised for some other optimal level.  A default gain of -10dB is
              used if a <u>gain</u> value is not given.

              See also the <b>gain</b> effect.

       <b>lowpass</b> [<b>-1</b>|<b>-2</b>] <u>frequency</u>[<b>k</b>] [width[<b>q</b>|<b>o</b>|<b>h</b>|<b>k</b>]]
              Apply a low-pass filter.  See the description of the <b>highpass</b> effect for details.

       <b>mcompand</b> "<u>attack1</u><b>,</b><u>decay1</u>{<b>,</b><u>attack2</u><b>,</b><u>decay2</u>}
              [<u>soft-knee-dB</u><b>:</b>]<u>in-dB1</u>[<b>,</b><u>out-dB1</u>]{<b>,</b><u>in-dB2</u><b>,</b><u>out-dB2</u>}
              [<u>gain</u> [<u>initial-volume-dB</u> [<u>delay</u>]]]" {<u>crossover-freq</u>[<b>k</b>] "attack1,..."}

              The multi-band compander is similar to the single-band compander but the audio  is  first  divided
              into  bands  using Linkwitz-Riley cross-over filters and a separately specifiable compander run on
              each band.  See the <b>compand</b> effect for the definition of its parameters.  Compand  parameters  are
              specified  between  double quotes and the crossover frequency for that band is given by <u>crossover-</u>
              <u>freq</u>; these can be repeated to create multiple bands.

              For example, the following (one long) command shows how multi-band companding is typically used in
              FM radio:
                 play track1.wav gain -3 sinc 8000- 29 100 mcompand \
                   "0.005,0.1 -47,-40,-34,-34,-17,-33" 100 \
                   "0.003,0.05 -47,-40,-34,-34,-17,-33" 400 \
                   "0.000625,0.0125 -47,-40,-34,-34,-15,-33" 1600 \
                   "0.0001,0.025 -47,-40,-34,-34,-31,-31,-0,-30" 6400 \
                   "0,0.025 -38,-31,-28,-28,-0,-25" \
                   gain 15 highpass 22 highpass 22 sinc -n 255 -b 16 -17500 \
                   gain 9 lowpass -1 17801
              The audio file is played with a simulated FM radio sound (or broadcast  signal  condition  if  the
              lowpass  filter  at the end is skipped).  Note that the pipeline is set up with US-style 75us pre-
              emphasis.

              See also <b>compand</b> for a single-band companding effect.

       <b>noiseprof</b> [<u>profile-file</u>]
              Calculate a profile of the audio for use in noise reduction.  See the description of the  <b>noisered</b>
              effect for details.

       <b>noisered</b> [<u>profile-file</u> [<u>amount</u>]]
              Reduce  noise in the audio signal by profiling and filtering.  This effect is moderately effective
              at removing consistent background noise such as hiss or hum.  To use it, first run  SoX  with  the
              <b>noiseprof</b>  effect  on  a  section of audio that ideally would contain silence but in fact contains
              noise - such sections are typically found at the beginning or the end of a  recording.   <b>noiseprof</b>
              will  write  out  a  noise  profile  to <u>profile-file</u>, or to stdout if no <u>profile-file</u> or if `-' is
              given.  E.g.
                 sox speech.wav -n trim 0 1.5 noiseprof speech.noise-profile
              To actually remove the noise, run SoX again, this time with the  <b>noisered</b>  effect;  <b>noisered</b>  will
              reduce  noise  according to a noise profile (which was generated by <b>noiseprof</b>), from <u>profile-file</u>,
              or from stdin if no <u>profile-file</u> or if `-' is given.  E.g.
                 sox speech.wav cleaned.wav noisered speech.noise-profile 0.3
              How much noise should be removed is specified by <u>amount</u>-<u>a</u> number between 0 and 1 with a default of
              0.5.  Higher numbers will remove more noise but present a greater likelihood  of  removing  wanted
              components  of  the  audio  signal.   Before  replacing an original recording with a noise-reduced
              version, experiment with different <u>amount</u> values to find the  optimal  one  for  your  audio;  use
              headphones  to  check  that you are happy with the results, paying particular attention to quieter
              sections of the audio.

              On most systems, the two stages - profiling and reduction - can be combined using a pipe, e.g.
                 sox noisy.wav -n trim 0 1 noiseprof | play noisy.wav noisered

       <b>norm</b> [<u>dB-level</u>]
              Normalise the audio.  <b>norm</b> is just an alias for <b>gain</b> <b>-n</b>; see the <b>gain</b> effect for details.

       <b>oops</b>   Out Of Phase Stereo effect.  Mixes stereo to  twin-mono  where  each  mono  channel  contains  the
              difference  between  the left and right stereo channels.  This is sometimes known as the `karaoke'
              effect as it often has the effect of removing most or all of the vocals from a recording.   It  is
              equivalent to <b>remix</b> <b>1,2i</b> <b>1,2i</b>.

       <b>overdrive</b> [<u><a href="../man20/gain.20.html">gain</a></u>(20) [<u><a href="../man20/colour.20.html">colour</a></u>(20)]]
              Non  linear  distortion.  The <u>colour</u> parameter controls the amount of even harmonic content in the
              over-driven output.

       <b>pad</b> { <u>length</u>[<b>@</b><u>position(=)</u>] }
              Pad the audio with silence, at the beginning, the end, or any specified points through the  audio.
              <u>length</u>  is  the amount of silence to insert and <u>position</u> the position in the input audio stream at
              which to insert it.  Any number of lengths  and  positions  may  be  specified,  provided  that  a
              specified  position  is not less that the previous one, and any time specification may be used for
              them.  <u>position</u> is optional for the first and last lengths specified and if omitted correspond  to
              the beginning and the end of the audio respectively.  For example, <b>pad</b> <b>1.5</b> <b>1.5</b> adds 1.5 seconds of
              silence  padding at each end of the audio, whilst <b>pad</b> <b>4000s@3:00</b> inserts 4000 samples of silence 3
              minutes into the audio.  If silence is wanted only at the end of the audio, specify either the end
              position or specify a zero-length pad at the start.

              See also <b>delay</b> for an effect that can add silence at the beginning of the audio on  a  channel-by-
              channel basis.

       <b>phaser</b> <u>gain-in</u> <u>gain-out</u> <u>delay</u> <u>decay</u> <u>speed</u> [<b>-s</b>|<b>-t</b>]
              Add a phasing effect to the audio.  See [3] for a detailed description of phasing.

              delay/decay/speed  gives  the  delay  in  milliseconds  and the decay (relative to gain-in) with a
              modulation speed in Hz.  The modulation is either  sinusoidal  (<b>-s</b>)   -  preferable  for  multiple
              instruments,  or  triangular (<b>-t</b>)  - gives single instruments a sharper phasing effect.  The decay
              should be less than 0.5 to avoid feedback, and usually no less than 0.1.  Gain-out is  the  volume
              of the output.

              For example:
                 play snare.flac phaser 0.8 0.74 3 0.4 0.5 -t
              Gentler:
                 play snare.flac phaser 0.9 0.85 4 0.23 1.3 -s
              A popular sound:
                 play snare.flac phaser 0.89 0.85 1 0.24 2 -t
              More severe:
                 play snare.flac phaser 0.6 0.66 3 0.6 2 -t

       <b>pitch</b> [<b>-q</b>] <u>shift</u> [<u>segment</u> [<u>search</u> [<u>overlap</u>]]]
              Change the audio pitch (but not tempo).

              <u>shift</u>  gives the pitch shift as positive or negative `cents' (i.e. 100ths of a semitone).  See the
              <b>tempo</b> effect for a description of the other parameters.

              See also the <b>bend</b>, <b>speed</b>, and <b>tempo</b> effects.

       <b>rate</b> [<b>-q</b>|<b>-l</b>|<b>-m</b>|<b>-h</b>|<b>-v</b>] [override-options] <u>RATE</u>[<b>k</b>]
              Change the audio sampling rate (i.e. resample the audio) to any given <u>RATE</u>  (even  non-integer  if
              this is supported by the output file format) using a quality level defined as follows:
                                            <u>Quality</u>   <u>Band-</u>   <u>Rej</u> <u>dB</u>   <u>Typical</u> <u>Use</u>

              where <u>Band-width</u> is the percentage of the audio frequency band that is preserved and <u>Rej</u> <u>dB</u> is the
              level  of  noise  rejection.   Increasing  levels  of  resampling  quality  come at the expense of
              increasing amounts of time to process the audio.  If no quality option is given, the quality level
              used is `high' (but see `Playing &amp; Recording Audio' above regarding playback).

              The `quick' algorithm uses cubic interpolation; all others  use  band-limited  interpolation.   By
              default,  all algorithms have a `linear' phase response; for `medium', `high' and `very high', the
              phase response is configurable (see below).

              The <b>rate</b> effect is invoked automatically if SoX's <b>-r</b> option specifies a rate that is different  to
              that  of  the  input  file(s).   Alternatively,  if this effect is given explicitly, then SoX's <b>-r</b>
              option need not be given.  For example, the following two commands are equivalent:
                 sox input.wav -r 48k output.wav bass -b 24
                 sox input.wav        output.wav bass -b 24 rate 48k
              though the second command is more flexible as it allows <b>rate</b> options to be given, and  allows  the
              effects to be ordered arbitrarily.
                                                     *        *        *

              Warning: technically detailed discussion follows.

              The  simple quality selection described above provides settings that satisfy the needs of the vast
              majority of resampling tasks.  Occasionally,  however,  it  may  be  desirable  to  fine-tune  the
              resampler's  filter  response;  this  can  be  achieved using <u>override</u> <u>options</u>, as detailed in the
              following table:
                               <b>-M/-I/-L</b>     Phase response = minimum/intermediate/linear
                               <b>-s</b>           Steep filter (band-width = 99%)
                               <b>-a</b>           Allow aliasing/imaging above the pass-band
                               <b>-b</b> <b>74-99.7</b>   Any band-width %
                               <b>-p</b> <b>0-100</b>     Any phase response (0 = minimum, 25 = intermediate,
                                            50 = linear, 100 = maximum)

              N.B.  Override options cannot be used with the `quick' or `low' quality algorithms.

              All resamplers use filters that can sometimes create `echo'  (a.k.a.   `ringing')  artefacts  with
              transient  signals such as those that occur with `finger snaps' or other highly percussive sounds.
              Such artefacts are much more noticeable to the human ear if they occur before the transient (`pre-
              echo') than if they occur after it (`post-echo').  Note that frequency of any  such  artefacts  is
              related  to  the  smaller  of  the  original  and  new sampling rates but that if this is at least
              44.1kHz, then the artefacts will lie outside the range of human hearing.

              A phase response setting may be used to control the distribution of  any  transient  echo  between
              `pre'  and `post': with minimum phase, there is no pre-echo but the longest post-echo; with linear
              phase, pre and post echo are in equal amounts (in signal terms, but  not  audibility  terms);  the
              intermediate  phase  setting attempts to find the best compromise by selecting a small length (and
              level) of pre-echo and a medium lengthed post-echo.

              Minimum, intermediate, or linear phase response is selected using the <b>-M</b>,  <b>-I</b>,  or  <b>-L</b>  option;  a
              custom  phase  response  can  be  created  with  the <b>-p</b> option.  Note that phase responses between
              `linear' and `maximum' (greater than 50) are rarely useful.

              A resampler's band-width setting determines how much of the  frequency  content  of  the  original
              signal  (w.r.t.  the  original  sample  rate  when  up-sampling, or the new sample rate when down-
              sampling) is preserved  during  conversion.   The  term  `pass-band'  is  used  to  refer  to  all
              frequencies  up  to  the  band-width point (e.g. for 44.1kHz sampling rate, and a resampling band-
              width of 95%, the pass-band represents frequencies from 0Hz (D.C.) to  circa  21kHz).   Increasing
              the  resampler's  band-width  results  in  a  slower  conversion  and  can increase transient echo
              artefacts (and vice versa).

              The <b>-s</b> `steep filter' option changes resampling band-width from the default 95% (based on the  3dB
              point),  to  99%.  The <b>-b</b> option allows the band-width to be set to any value in the range 74-99.7
              %, but note that band-width values greater than 99% are not recommended for normal use as they can
              cause excessive transient echo.

              If the <b>-a</b> option is given, then aliasing/imaging above the pass-band  is  allowed.   For  example,
              with  44.1kHz sampling rate, and a resampling band-width of 95%, this means that frequency content
              above 21kHz can be distorted; however, since this is above the pass-band (i.e.  above the  highest
              frequency  of  interest/audibility),  this  may  not  be  a  problem.   The  benefits  of allowing
              aliasing/imaging are reduced  processing  time,  and  reduced  (by  almost  half)  transient  echo
              artefacts.   Note  that  if  this  option  is given, then the minimum band-width allowable with <b>-b</b>
              increases to 85%.

              Examples:
                 sox input.wav -b 16 output.wav rate -s -a 44100 dither -s
              default (high) quality resampling; overrides: steep filter,  allow  aliasing;  to  44.1kHz  sample
              rate; noise-shaped dither to 16-bit WAV file.
                 sox input.wav -b 24 output.aiff rate -v -I -b 90 48k
              very  high  quality resampling; overrides: intermediate phase, band-width 90%; to 48k sample rate;
              store output to 24-bit AIFF file.
                                                     *        *        *

              The <b>pitch</b> and <b>speed</b> effects use the <b>rate</b> effect at their core.

       <b>remix</b> [<b>-a</b>|<b>-m</b>|<b>-p</b>] &lt;<u>out-spec</u>&gt;
              <u>out-spec</u>  = <u>in-spec</u>{<b>,</b><u>in-spec</u>} | <b>0</b>
              <u>in-spec</u>   = [<u>in-chan</u>][<b>-</b>[<u>in-chan2</u>]][<u>vol-spec</u>]
              <u>vol-spec</u>  = <b>p</b>|<b>i</b>|<b>v</b>[<u>volume</u>]

              Select and mix input audio channels into output audio channels.  Each output channel is specified,
              in turn, by a given <u>out-spec</u>: a list of contributing input channels and volume specifications.

              Note that this effect operates on the audio <u>channels</u> within the SoX effects processing  chain;  it
              should  not  be  confused  with the <b>-m</b> global option (where multiple <u>files</u> are mix-combined before
              entering the effects chain).

              An <u>out-spec</u> contains comma-separated input  channel-numbers  and  hyphen-delimited  channel-number
              ranges; alternatively, <b>0</b> may be given to create a silent output channel.  For example,
                 sox input.wav output.wav remix 6 7 8 0
              creates an output file with four channels, where channels 1, 2, and 3 are copies of channels 6, 7,
              and 8 in the input file, and channel 4 is silent.  Whereas
                 sox input.wav output.wav remix 1-3,7 3
              creates  a  (somewhat  bizarre)  stereo  output file where the left channel is a mix-down of input
              channels 1, 2, 3, and 7, and the right channel is a copy of input channel 3.

              Where a range of channels is specified, the channel numbers to the left and right  of  the  hyphen
              are optional and default to 1 and to the number of input channels respectively. Thus
                 sox input.wav output.wav remix -
              performs a mix-down of all input channels to mono.

              By  default, where an output channel is mixed from multiple (n) input channels, each input channel
              will be scaled by a factor of ¹/n.  Custom mixing volumes can be set by following  a  given  input
              channel  or  range  of  input channels with a <u>vol-spec</u> (volume specification).  This is one of the
              letters <b>p</b>, <b>i</b>, or <b>v</b>, followed by a volume number, the meaning of which depends on the given  letter
              and is defined as follows:
                                  <u>Letter</u>   <u>Volume</u> <u>number</u>        <u>Notes</u>
                                    p      power adjust in dB   0 = no change
                                    i      power adjust in dB   As `p', but invert the audio
                                    v      voltage multiplier   1 = no change, 0.5 ≈ 6dB
                                                                attenuation, 2 ≈ 6dB gain,
                                                                -1 = invert

              If  an <u>out-spec</u> includes at least one <u>vol-spec</u> then, by default, ¹/n scaling is not applied to any
              other channels in the same out-spec (though may be in other out-specs).  The -a (automatic) option
              however, can be given to retain the automatic scaling in this case.  For example,
                 sox input.wav output.wav remix 1,2 3,4v0.8
              results in channel level multipliers of 0.5,0.5 1,0.8, whereas
                 sox input.wav output.wav remix -a 1,2 3,4v0.8
              results in channel level multipliers of 0.5,0.5 0.5,0.8.

              The -m (manual) option disables all automatic volume adjustments, so
                 sox input.wav output.wav remix -m 1,2 3,4v0.8
              results in channel level multipliers of 1,1 1,0.8.

              The volume number is optional and omitting it corresponds to no volume change; however,  the  only
              case in which this is useful is in conjunction with <b>i</b>.  For example, if <u>input.wav</u> is stereo, then
                 sox input.wav output.wav remix 1,2i
              is a mono equivalent of the <b>oops</b> effect.

              If  the  <b>-p</b> option is given, then any automatic ¹/n scaling is replaced by ¹/√n (`power') scaling;
              this gives a louder mix but one that might occasionally clip.
                                                     *        *        *

              One use of the <b>remix</b> effect is to split an audio file into a set of files, each containing one  of
              the constituent channels (in order to perform subsequent processing on individual audio channels).
              Where  more than a few channels are involved, a script such as the following (Bourne shell script)
              is useful:
              #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
              chans=`soxi -c "$1"`
              while [ $chans -ge 1 ]; do
                 chans0=`printf %02i $chans`   # 2 digits hence up to 99 chans
                 out=`echo "$1"|sed "s/\(.*\)\.\(.*\)/\1-$chans0.\2/"`
                 sox "$1" "$out" remix $chans
                 chans=`expr $chans - 1`
              done
              If a file <u>input.wav</u> containing six audio channels were given, the script would produce six  output
              files: <u>input-01.wav</u>, <u>input-02.wav</u>, ..., <u>input-06.wav</u>.

              See also the <b>swap</b> effect.

       <b>repeat</b> [<u><a href="../man1/count.1.html">count</a></u>(1)|<b>-</b>]
              Repeat  the entire audio <u>count</u> times, or once if <u>count</u> is not given.  The special value <b>-</b> requests
              infinite repetition.  Requires temporary file space to store the audio to be repeated.  Note  that
              repeating once yields two copies: the original audio and the repeated audio.

       <b>reverb</b> [<b>-w</b>|<b>--wet-only</b>] [<u>reverberance</u> (50%) [<u>HF-damping</u> (50%)
              [<u>room-scale</u> (100%) [<u>stereo-depth</u> (100%)
              [<u>pre-delay</u> (0ms) [<u>wet-gain</u> (0dB)]]]]]]

              Add  reverberation  to  the  audio  using  the  `freeverb'  algorithm.   A reverberation effect is
              sometimes desirable for concert halls that are too small or contain so many people that the hall's
              natural reverberance is diminished.  Applying a small amount of stereo  reverb  to  a  (dry)  mono
              signal  will  usually  make  it  sound  more  natural.   See  [3]  for  a  detailed description of
              reverberation.

              Note that this effect increases both the volume and  the  length  of  the  audio,  so  to  prevent
              clipping in these domains, a typical invocation might be:
                 play dry.wav gain -3 pad 0 3 reverb
              The  <b>-w</b>  option  can  be  given  to select only the `wet' signal, thus allowing it to be processed
              further, independently of the `dry' signal.  E.g.
                 play -m voice.wav "|sox voice.wav -p reverse reverb -w reverse"
              for a reverse reverb effect.

       <b>reverse</b>
              Reverse the audio completely.  Requires temporary file space to store the audio to be reversed.

       <b>riaa</b>   Apply RIAA vinyl playback equalisation.  The sampling rate must be one of: 44.1, 48, 88.2, 96 kHz.

              This effect supports the <b>--plot</b> global option.

       <b>silence</b> [<b>-l</b>] <u>above-periods</u> [<u>duration</u> <u>threshold</u>[<b>d</b>|<b>%</b>]
              [<u>below-periods</u> <u>duration</u> <u>threshold</u>[<b>d</b>|<b>%</b>]]

              Removes silence from the beginning, middle, or end of the audio.  `Silence'  is  determined  by  a
              specified threshold.

              The  <u>above-periods</u>  value  is  used to indicate if audio should be trimmed at the beginning of the
              audio. A value of zero indicates no silence should be trimmed from the beginning. When  specifying
              a  non-zero  <u>above-periods</u>,  it trims audio up until it finds non-silence. Normally, when trimming
              silence from beginning of audio the <u>above-periods</u> will be 1 but it  can  be  increased  to  higher
              values to trim all audio up to a specific count of non-silence periods. For example, if you had an
              audio  file  with  two  songs  that each contained 2 seconds of silence before the song, you could
              specify an <u>above-period</u> of 2 to strip out both silence periods and the first song.

              When <u>above-periods</u> is non-zero, you must also specify a <u>duration</u> and <u>threshold</u>. <u>duration</u> indicates
              the amount of time that non-silence must be detected before it stops trimming audio. By increasing
              the duration, burst of noise can be treated as silence and trimmed off.

              <u>threshold</u> is used to indicate what sample value you should treat as silence.  For digital audio, a
              value of 0 may be fine but for audio recorded from analog, you may wish to increase the  value  to
              account for background noise.

              When optionally trimming silence from the end of the audio, you specify a <u>below-periods</u> count.  In
              this  case, <u>below-period</u> means to remove all audio after silence is detected.  Normally, this will
              be a value 1 of but it can be increased to skip over periods of  silence  that  are  wanted.   For
              example,  if  you have a song with 2 seconds of silence in the middle and 2 second at the end, you
              could set below-period to a value of 2 to skip over the silence in the middle of the audio.

              For <u>below-periods</u>, <u>duration</u> specifies a period of silence that must  exist  before  audio  is  not
              copied  any  more.   By  specifying  a  higher duration, silence that is wanted can be left in the
              audio.  For example, if you have a song with an expected 1 second of silence in the middle  and  2
              seconds  of  silence  at  the  end,  a duration of 2 seconds could be used to skip over the middle
              silence.

              Unfortunately, you must know the length of the silence at the end of your audio file to  trim  off
              silence  reliably.   A  workaround  is  to  use the <b>silence</b> effect in combination with the <b>reverse</b>
              effect.  By first reversing the audio, you can use the <u>above-periods</u> to reliably  trim  all  audio
              from what looks like the front of the file.  Then reverse the file again to get back to normal.

              To remove silence from the middle of a file, specify a <u>below-periods</u> that is negative.  This value
              is  then  treated  as a positive value and is also used to indicate that the effect should restart
              processing as specified by the <u>above-periods</u>, making it suitable for removing periods  of  silence
              in the middle of the audio.

              The  option  <b>-l</b> indicates that <u>below-periods</u> <u>duration</u> length of audio should be left intact at the
              beginning of each period of silence.  For example, if you want to remove long pauses between words
              but do not want to remove the pauses completely.

              <u>duration</u> is a time specification with the peculiarity that a  bare  number  is  interpreted  as  a
              sample  count, not as a number of seconds.  For specifying seconds, either use the <b>t</b> suffix (as in
              `2t') or specify minutes, too (as in `0:02').

              <u>threshold</u> numbers may be suffixed with <b>d</b> to indicate the value is in decibels, or <b>%</b> to indicate  a
              percentage of maximum value of the sample value (<b>0%</b> specifies pure digital silence).

              The following example shows how this effect can be used to start a recording that does not contain
              the  delay at the start which usually occurs between `pressing the record button' and the start of
              the performance:

       <b>sinc</b> [<b>-a</b> <u>att</u>|<b>-b</b> <u>beta</u>] [<b>-p</b> <u>phase</u>|<b>-M</b>|<b>-I</b>|<b>-L</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>tbw</u>|<b>-n</b> <u>taps</u>] [<u>freqHP</u>][<b>-</b><u>freqLP</u> [<b>-t</b> tbw|<b>-n</b> taps]]
              Apply a sinc kaiser-windowed low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, or band-reject filter to the  signal.
              The  <u>freqHP</u>  and  <u>freqLP</u> parameters give the frequencies of the 6dB points of a high-pass and low-
              pass filter that may be invoked individually, or together.  If both are given,  then  <u>freqHP</u>  less
              than  <u>freqLP</u>  creates a band-pass filter, <u>freqHP</u> greater than <u>freqLP</u> creates a band-reject filter.
              For example, the invocations
                 sinc 3k
                 sinc -4k
                 sinc 3k-4k
                 sinc 4k-3k
              create a high-pass, low-pass, band-pass, and band-reject filter respectively.

              The default stop-band attenuation of 120dB can be overridden with <b>-a</b>; alternatively,  the  kaiser-
              window `beta' parameter can be given directly with <b>-b</b>.

              The  default  transition  band-width of 5% of the total band can be overridden with <b>-t</b> (and <u>tbw</u> in
              Hertz); alternatively, the number of filter taps can be given directly with <b>-n</b>.

              If both <u>freqHP</u> and <u>freqLP</u> are given, then a <b>-t</b> or <b>-n</b> option given to the left of  the  frequencies
              applies  to  both  frequencies; one of these options given to the right of the frequencies applies
              only to <u>freqLP</u>.

              The <b>-p</b>, <b>-M</b>, <b>-I</b>, and <b>-L</b> options control the filter's  phase  response;  see  the  <b>rate</b>  effect  for
              details.

              This effect supports the <b>--plot</b> global option.

       <b>spectrogram</b> [<u>options</u>]
              Create  a  spectrogram  of  the  audio;  the audio is passed unmodified through the SoX processing
              chain.  This effect is optional - type <b>sox</b> <b>--help</b> and check the list of supported effects  to  see
              if it has been included.

              The  spectrogram  is  rendered  in a Portable Network Graphic (PNG) file, and shows time in the X-
              axis, frequency in the Y-axis, and audio signal  magnitude  in  the  Z-axis.   Z-axis  values  are
              represented  by  the  colour (or optionally the intensity) of the pixels in the X-Y plane.  If the
              audio signal contains multiple channels then these are shown from  top  to  bottom  starting  from
              channel 1 (which is the left channel for stereo audio).

              For example, if `my.wav' is a stereo file, then with
                 sox my.wav -n spectrogram
              a  spectrogram  of  the  entire  file  will  be created in the file `spectrogram.png'.  More often
              though, analysis of a smaller portion of the audio is required; e.g. with
                 sox my.wav -n remix 2 trim 20 30 spectrogram
              the spectrogram shows information only from the second (right) channel, and of thirty  seconds  of
              audio  starting  from  twenty seconds in.  To analyse a small portion of the frequency domain, the
              <b>rate</b> effect may be used, e.g.
                 sox my.wav -n rate 6k spectrogram
              allows detailed analysis of frequencies up to 3kHz (half the sampling rate) i.e. where  the  human
              auditory system is most sensitive.  With
                 sox my.wav -n trim 0 10 spectrogram -x 600 -y 200 -z 100
              the  given  options  control  the  size  of  the  spectrogram's  X,  Y &amp; Z axes (in this case, the
              spectrogram area of the produced image will be 600 by 200 pixels in size and the Z-axis range will
              be 100 dB).  Note that the produced image includes axes legends etc.  and  so  will  be  a  little
              larger than the specified spectrogram size.  In this example:
                 sox -n -n synth 6 tri 10k:14k spectrogram -z 100 -w kaiser
              an  analysis  `window'  with  high  dynamic range is selected to best display the spectrogram of a
              swept triangular wave.  For a smilar example, append the following to the `chime' command  in  the
              description of the <b>delay</b> effect (above):
                 rate 2k spectrogram -X 200 -Z -10 -w kaiser
              Options  are also available to control the appearance (colour-set, brightness, contrast, etc.) and
              filename of the spectrogram; e.g. with
                 sox my.wav -n spectrogram -m -l -o print.png
              a spectrogram is created suitable for printing on a `black and white' printer.

              <u>Options:</u>

              <b>-x</b> <u>num</u> Change the (maximum) width (X-axis) of the spectrogram from its default value of 800 pixels
                     to a given number between 100 and 200000.  See also <b>-X</b> and <b>-d</b>.

              <b>-X</b> <u>num</u> X-axis pixels/second; the default is auto-calculated  to  fit  the  given  or  known  audio
                     duration  to  the  X-axis  size,  or  100 otherwise.  If given in conjunction with <b>-d</b>, this
                     option affects the width of the spectrogram; otherwise, it  affects  the  duration  of  the
                     spectrogram.   <u>num</u>  can  be from 1 (low time resolution) to 5000 (high time resolution) and
                     need not be an integer.  SoX  may  make  a  slight  adjustment  to  the  given  number  for
                     processing  quantisation  reasons;  if so, SoX will report the actual number used (viewable
                     when the SoX global option <b>-V</b> is in effect).  See also <b>-x</b> and <b>-d</b>.

              <b>-y</b> <u>num</u> Sets the Y-axis size in pixels (per channel); this is the number of frequency  `bins'  used
                     in  the Fourier analysis that produces the spectrogram.  N.B. it can be slow to produce the
                     spectrogram if this number is not one more than a power of two (e.g. 129).  By default  the
                     Y-axis  size  is  chosen  automatically  (depending on the number of channels).  See <b>-Y</b> for
                     alternative way of setting spectrogram height.

              <b>-Y</b> <u>num</u> Sets the target total height of the spectrogram(s).   The  default  value  is  550  pixels.
                     Using  this  option  (and  by default), SoX will choose a height for individual spectrogram
                     channels that is one more than a power of two, so the actual total height may fall short of
                     the given number.  However, there is also a minimum height per channel so if there are many
                     channels, the number may be exceeded.  See <b>-y</b> for alternative way  of  setting  spectrogram
                     height.

              <b>-z</b> <u>num</u> Z-axis  (colour)  range in dB, default 120.  This sets the dynamic-range of the spectrogram
                     to be -<u>num</u> dBFS to 0 dBFS.  <u>Num</u>  may  range  from  20  to  180.   Decreasing  dynamic-range
                     effectively increases the `contrast' of the spectrogram display, and vice versa.

              <b>-Z</b> <u>num</u> Sets  the  upper  limit  of  the  Z-axis in dBFS.  A negative <u>num</u> effectively increases the
                     `brightness' of the spectrogram display, and vice versa.

              <b>-q</b> <u>num</u> Sets the Z-axis quantisation, i.e. the number of  different  colours  (or  intensities)  in
                     which  to  render  Z-axis values.  A small number (e.g. 4) will give a `poster'-like effect
                     making it easier to discern magnitude bands of similar level.  Small numbers  also  usually
                     result  in small PNG files.  The number given specifies the number of colours to use inside
                     the Z-axis range; two colours are reserved to represent out-of-range values.

              <b>-w</b> <u>name</u>
                     Window: Hann (default), Hamming, Bartlett, Rectangular, Kaiser or Dolph.   The  spectrogram
                     is  produced using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) algorithm.  A significant parameter
                     to this algorithm is the choice of `window function'.  By default, SoX uses the Hann window
                     which has good all-round frequency-resolution and  dynamic-range  properties.   For  better
                     frequency  resolution  (but  lower  dynamic-range),  select  a  Hamming  window; for higher
                     dynamic-range (but poorer frequency-resolution), select a Dolph window.   Kaiser,  Bartlett
                     and Rectangular windows are also available.

              <b>-W</b> <u>num</u> Window  adjustment  parameter.  This can be used to make small adjustments to the Kaiser or
                     Dolph window shape.  A positive number (up to ten) increases its dynamic range, a  negative
                     number decreases it.

              <b>-s</b>     Allow  slack overlapping of DFT windows.  This can, in some cases, increase image sharpness
                     and give greater adherence to the <b>-x</b> value, but at the expense of a little spectral loss.

              <b>-m</b>     Creates a monochrome spectrogram (the default is colour).

              <b>-h</b>     Selects a high-colour palette - less visually pleasing than the default colour palette, but
                     it may make it easier to differentiate  different  levels.   If  this  option  is  used  in
                     conjunction with <b>-m</b>, the result will be a hybrid monochrome/colour palette.

              <b>-p</b> <u>num</u> Permute the colours in a colour or hybrid palette.  The <u>num</u> parameter, from 1 (the default)
                     to 6, selects the permutation.

              <b>-l</b>     Creates  a  `printer  friendly' spectrogram with a light background (the default has a dark
                     background).

              <b>-a</b>     Suppress the display of the axis lines.  This is sometimes useful  in  helping  to  discern
                     artefacts at the spectrogram edges.

              <b>-r</b>     Raw spectrogram: suppress the display of axes and legends.

              <b>-A</b>     Selects  an  alternative,  fixed  colour-set.  This is provided only for compatibility with
                     spectrograms produced by another package.  It should not normally be used as  it  has  some
                     problems,  not  least, a lack of differentiation at the bottom end which results in masking
                     of low-level artefacts.

              <b>-t</b> <u>text</u>
                     Set the image title - text to display above the spectrogram.

              <b>-c</b> <u>text</u>
                     Set (or clear) the image  comment  -  text  to  display  below  and  to  the  left  of  the
                     spectrogram.

              <b>-o</b> <u>file</u>
                     Name  of  the spectrogram output PNG file, default `spectrogram.png'.  If `-' is given, the
                     spectrogram will be sent to standard output (stdout).

              <u>Advanced</u> <u>Options:</u>
              In order to process a smaller section of audio without  affecting  other  effects  or  the  output
              signal (unlike when the <b>trim</b> effect is used), the following options may be used.

              <b>-d</b> <u>duration</u>
                     This  option  sets  the  X-axis  resolution such that audio with the given <u>duration</u> (a time
                     specification) fits the selected (or default) X-axis width.  For example,
                        sox input.mp3 output.wav -n spectrogram -d 1:00 stats
                     creates a spectrogram showing the first minute of the audio, whilst
                     the <b>stats</b> effect is applied to the entire audio signal.

                     See also <b>-X</b> for an alternative way of setting the X-axis resolution.

              <b>-S</b> <u>position(=)</u>
                     Start the spectrogram at the given point in the audio stream.  For example
                        sox input.aiff output.wav spectrogram -S 1:00
                     creates a spectrogram showing all but the first minute  of  the  audio  (the  output  file,
                     however, receives the entire audio stream).

              For the ability to perform off-line processing of spectral data, see the <b>stat</b> effect.

       <b>speed</b> <u>factor</u>[<b>c</b>]
              Adjust the audio speed (pitch and tempo together).  <u>factor</u> is either the ratio of the new speed to
              the  old  speed: greater than 1 speeds up, less than 1 slows down, or, if appended with the letter
              `c', the number of cents (i.e. 100ths of a semitone) by which the  pitch  (and  tempo)  should  be
              adjusted: greater than 0 increases, less than 0 decreases.

              Technically,  the  speed  effect  only  changes  the  sample rate information, leaving the samples
              themselves untouched.  The <b>rate</b> effect is invoked automatically to resample to the  output  sample
              rate, using its default quality/speed.  For higher quality or higher speed resampling, in addition
              to the <b>speed</b> effect, specify the <b>rate</b> effect with the desired quality option.

              See also the <b>bend</b>, <b>pitch</b>, and <b>tempo</b> effects.

       <b>splice</b>  [<b>-h</b>|<b>-t</b>|<b>-q</b>] { <u>position(=)</u>[<b>,</b><u>excess</u>[<b>,</b><u>leeway</u>]] }
              Splice  together audio sections.  This effect provides two things over simple audio concatenation:
              a (usually short) cross-fade is applied at the join, and a wave similarity comparison is  made  to
              help determine the best place at which to make the join.

              One of the options <b>-h</b>, <b>-t</b>, or <b>-q</b> may be given to select the fade envelope as half-cosine wave (the
              default), triangular (a.k.a. linear), or quarter-cosine wave respectively.
                                      <u>Type</u>   <u>Audio</u>          <u>Fade</u> <u>level</u>       <u>Transitions</u>
                                       <b>t</b>     correlated     constant gain    abrupt
                                       <b>h</b>     correlated     constant gain    smooth
                                       <b>q</b>     uncorrelated   constant power   smooth

              To perform a splice, first use the <b>trim</b> effect to select the audio sections to be joined together.
              As when performing a tape splice, the end of the section to be spliced onto should be trimmed with
              a  small  <u>excess</u> (default 0.005 seconds) of audio after the ideal joining point.  The beginning of
              the audio section to splice on should be trimmed with the same <u>excess</u> (before  the  ideal  joining
              point), plus an additional <u>leeway</u> (default 0.005 seconds).  Any time specification may be used for
              these  parameters.   SoX should then be invoked with the two audio sections as input files and the
              <b>splice</b> effect given with the position at which to perform the splice - this is length of the first
              audio section (including the excess).

              The following diagram uses the tape analogy  to  illustrate  the  splice  operation.   The  effect
              simulates the diagonal cuts and joins the two pieces:

                    length1   excess

              For  example, a long song begins with two verses which start (as determined e.g. by using the <b>play</b>
              command with the <b>trim</b> (<u>start</u>) effect) at times 0:30.125 and 1:03.432.  The following commands  cut
              out the first verse:
                 sox too-long.wav part1.wav trim 0 30.130
              (5 ms excess, after the first verse starts)
                 sox too-long.wav part2.wav trim 1:03.422
              (5 ms excess plus 5 ms leeway, before the second verse starts)
                 sox part1.wav part2.wav just-right.wav splice 30.130
              For another example, the SoX command
                 play "|sox -n -p synth 1 sin %1" "|sox -n -p synth 1 sin %3"
              generates  and  plays  two  notes,  but there is a nasty click at the transition; the click can be
              removed by splicing instead of concatenating the audio, i.e. by appending <b>splice</b> <b>1</b> to the command.
              (Clicks at the beginning and end of the audio can be removed by <u>preceding</u> the splice  effect  with
              <b>fade</b> <b>q</b> <b>.01</b> <b>2</b> <b>.01</b>).

              Provided  your  arithmetic  is good enough, multiple splices can be performed with a single <b>splice</b>
              invocation.  For example:
              #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
              # Audio Copy and Paste Over
              # acpo infile copy-start copy-stop paste-over-start outfile
              # No chained time specifications allowed for the parameters
              # (i.e. such that contain +/-).
              e=0.005                      # Using default excess
              l=$e                         # and leeway.
              sox "$1" piece.wav trim $2-$e-$l =$3+$e
              sox "$1" part1.wav trim 0 $4+$e
              sox "$1" part2.wav trim $4+$3-$2-$e-$l
              sox part1.wav piece.wav part2.wav "$5" \
                 splice $4+$e +$3-$2+$e+$l+$e
              In the above Bourne shell script, two splices are used to `copy and paste' audio.
                                                     *        *        *

              It is also possible to use this effect to perform general cross-fades, e.g. to join two songs.  In
              this case, <u>excess</u> would typically be an number of seconds, the <b>-q</b> option would typically be  given
              (to  select an `equal power' cross-fade), and <u>leeway</u> should be zero (which is the default if <b>-q</b> is
              given).  For example, if f1.wav and f2.wav are audio files to be cross-faded, then
                 sox f1.wav f2.wav out.wav splice -q $(soxi -D f1.wav),3
              cross-fades the files where the point of equal loudness is 3 seconds before  the  end  of  f1.wav,
              i.e.  the  total length of the cross-fade is 2 × 3 = 6 seconds (Note: the $(...) notation is POSIX
              shell).

                                                                      above  for reasons why it is

              Note that the delta measurements are not applicable for multi-channel audio.

              The  <b>-s</b>  option can be used to scale the input data by a given factor.  The default value of <u>scale</u>
              is 2147483647 (i.e. the maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer).  Internal effects  always  work
              with signed long PCM data and so the value should relate to this fact.

              The <b>-rms</b> option will convert all output average values to `root mean square' format.

              The <b>-v</b> option displays only the `Volume Adjustment' value.

              The  <b>-freq</b> option calculates the input's power spectrum (4096 point DFT) instead of the statistics
              listed above.  This should only be used with a single channel audio file.

              The <b>-d</b> option displays a hex dump of the 32-bit signed PCM data audio in  SoX's  internal  buffer.
              This  is  mainly  used  to  help track down endian problems that sometimes occur in cross-platform
              versions of SoX.

              See also the <b>stats</b> effect.

       <b>stats</b> [<b>-b</b> <u>bits</u>|<b>-x</b> <u>bits</u>|<b>-s</b> <u>scale</u>] [<b>-w</b> <u>window-time</u>]
              Display time domain statistical information about the audio channels; audio is  passed  unmodified

              <u>DC</u> <u>offset</u>, <u>Min</u> <u>level</u>, and <u>Max</u> <u>level</u> are shown, by default, in the range  ±1.   If  the  <b>-b</b>  (bits)
              options  is given, then these three measurements will be scaled to a signed integer with the given
              number of bits; for example, for 16 bits, the scale would be -32768  to  +32767.   The  <b>-x</b>  option
              behaves  the  same  way  as <b>-b</b> except that the signed integer values are displayed in hexadecimal.
              The <b>-s</b> option scales the three measurements by a given floating-point number.

              <u>Pk</u> <u>lev</u> <u>dB</u> and <u>RMS</u> <u>lev</u> <u>dB</u> are standard  peak  and  RMS  level  measured  in  dBFS.   <u>RMS</u> <u>Pk</u> <u>dB</u>  and
              <u>RMS</u> <u>Tr</u> <u>dB</u> are peak and trough values for RMS level measured over a short window (default 50ms).

              <u>Crest</u> <u>factor</u> is the standard ratio of peak to RMS level (note: not in dB).

              <u>Flat</u> <u>factor</u>  is  a  measure  of the flatness (i.e. consecutive samples with the same value) of the
              signal at its peak levels (i.e. either <u>Min</u> <u>level</u>,  or  <u>Max</u> <u>level</u>).   <u>Pk</u> <u>count</u>  is  the  number  of
              occasions (not the number of samples) that the signal attained either <u>Min</u> <u>level</u>, or <u>Max</u> <u>level</u>.

              The right-hand <u>Bit-depth</u> figure is the standard definition of bit-depth i.e. bits less significant
              than  the  given number are fixed at zero.  The left-hand figure is the number of most significant
              bits that are fixed at zero (or one for negative numbers) subtracted from  the  right-hand  figure
              (the number subtracted is directly related to <u>Pk</u> <u>lev</u> <u>dB</u>).

              For multi-channel audio, an overall figure for each of the above measurements is given and derived
              from  the  channel  figures  as  follows:  <u>DC</u> <u>offset</u>:  maximum  magnitude;  <u>Max</u> <u>level</u>,  <u>Pk</u> <u>lev</u> <u>dB</u>,
              <u>RMS</u> <u>Pk</u> <u>dB</u>, <u>Bit-depth</u>: maximum; <u>Min</u> <u>level</u>, <u>RMS</u> <u>Tr</u> <u>dB</u>: minimum; <u>RMS</u> <u>lev</u> <u>dB</u>,  <u>Flat</u> <u>factor</u>,  <u>Pk</u> <u>count</u>:
              average; <u>Crest</u> <u>factor</u>: not applicable.

              <u>Length</u> <u>s</u>  is  the  duration  in  seconds of the audio, and <u>Num</u> <u>samples</u> is equal to the sample-rate
              multiplied by <u>Length</u>.   <u>Scale</u> <u>Max</u>  is  the  scaling  applied  to  the  first  three  measurements;
              specifically,  it  is  the maximum value that could apply to <u>Max</u> <u>level</u>.  <u>Window</u> <u>s</u> is the length of
              the window used for the peak and trough RMS measurements.

              See also the <b>stat</b> effect.

       <b>swap</b>   Swap stereo channels.  If the input is not stereo, pairs of channels are swapped, and  a  possible
              odd  last  channel passed through.  E.g., for seven channels, the output order will be 2, 1, 4, 3,
              6, 5, 7.

              See also <b>remix</b> for an effect that allows arbitrary channel selection and ordering (and mixing).

       <b>stretch</b> <u>factor</u> [<u>window</u> <u>fade</u> <u>shift</u> <u>fading</u>]
              Change the audio duration (but not its pitch).  This effect is broadly  equivalent  to  the  <b>tempo</b>
              effect with (<u>factor</u> inverted and) <u>search</u> set to zero, so in general, its results are comparatively
              poor; it is retained as it can sometimes out-perform <b>tempo</b> for small <u>factor</u>s.

              <u>factor</u>  of  stretching: &gt;1 lengthen, &lt;1 shorten duration.  <u>window</u> size is in ms.  Default is 20ms.
              The <u>fade</u> option, can be `lin'.  <u>shift</u> ratio, in [0 1].  Default depends on stretch  factor.  1  to
              shorten,  0.8  to lengthen.  The <u>fading</u> ratio, in [0 0.5].  The amount of a fade's default depends
              on <u>factor</u> and <u>shift</u>.

              See also the <b>tempo</b> effect.

       <b>synth</b> [<b>-j</b> <u>KEY</u>] [<b>-n</b>] [<u>len</u> [<u>off</u> [<u>ph</u> [<u>p1</u> [<u>p2</u> [<u>p3</u>]]]]]] {[<u>type</u>] [<u>combine</u>] [[<b>%</b>]<u>freq</u>[<b>k</b>][<b>:</b>|<b>+</b>|<b>/</b>|<b>-</b>[<b>%</b>]<u>freq2</u>[<b>k</b>]]]
       [<u>off</u> [<u>ph</u> [<u>p1</u> [<u>p2</u> [<u>p3</u>]]]]]}
              This effect can be used to generate fixed or swept frequency audio tones with various wave shapes,
              or to generate wide-band noise of various `colours'.  Multiple synth effects can  be  cascaded  to
              produce  more  complex  waveforms;  at  each  stage it is possible to choose whether the generated
              waveform will be mixed with, or modulated onto the output from the previous stage.  Audio for each
              channel in a multi-channel audio file can be synthesised independently.

              Though this  effect  is  used  to  generate  audio,  an  input  file  must  still  be  given,  the
              characteristics of which will be used to set the synthesised audio length, the number of channels,
              and the sampling rate; however, since the input file's audio is not normally needed, a `null file'
              (with  the  special  name  <b>-n</b>)  is often given instead (and the length specified as a parameter to
              <b>synth</b> or by another given effect that has an associated length).

              For example, the following produces a 3 second, 48kHz, audio file  containing  a  sine-wave  swept
              from 300 to 3300 Hz:
                 sox -n output.wav synth 3 sine 300-3300
              and this produces an 8 kHz version:
                 sox -r 8000 -n output.wav synth 3 sine 300-3300
              Multiple  channels  can  be  synthesised  by specifying the set of parameters shown between braces
              multiple times; the following puts the swept tone in the left channel and adds  `brown'  noise  in
              the right:
                 sox -n output.wav synth 3 sine 300-3300 brownnoise
              The  following  example  shows  how  two  synth  effects  can be cascaded to create a more complex
              waveform:
                 play -n synth 0.5 sine 200-500 synth 0.5 sine fmod 700-100
              Frequencies can also be given in `scientific' note notation, or, by prefixing a `%' character,  as
              a  number  of semitones relative to `middle A' (440 Hz).  For example, the following could be used
              to help tune a guitar's low `E' string:
                 play -n synth 4 pluck %-29
              or with a (Bourne shell) loop, the whole guitar:
                 for n in E2 A2 D3 G3 B3 E4; do
                   play -n synth 4 pluck $n repeat 2; done
              See the <b>delay</b> effect (above) and the reference to `SoX scripting examples' (below) for more  <b>synth</b>
              examples.

              <b>N.B.</b>   This  effect  generates  audio  at maximum volume (0dBFS), which means that there is a high
              chance of clipping when using the audio subsequently, so in many cases, you will  want  to  follow
              this  effect with the <b>gain</b> effect to prevent this from happening. (See also <b>Clipping</b> above.)  Note
              that, by default, the <b>synth</b> effect incorporates the functionality of <b>gain</b> <b>-h</b> (see the <b>gain</b>  effect
              for details); <b>synth</b>'s <b>-n</b> option may be given to disable this behaviour.

              A detailed description of each <b>synth</b> parameter follows:

              <u>len</u>  is  the length of audio to synthesise (any time specification); a value of 0 indicated to use
              the input length, which is also the default.

              <u>type</u> is one  of  sine,  square,  triangle,  sawtooth,  trapezium,  exp,  [white]noise,  tpdfnoise,
              pinknoise, brownnoise, pluck; default=sine.

              <u>combine</u>  is  one  of  create,  mix,  amod  (amplitude  modulation),  fmod  (frequency modulation);
              default=create.

              <u>freq</u>/<u>freq2</u> are the frequencies at the beginning/end of synthesis in Hz or, if preceded  with  `%',
              semitones relative to A (440 Hz); alternatively, `scientific' note notation (e.g. E2) may be used.
              The  default  frequency  is  440Hz.  By default, the tuning used with the note notations is `equal
              temperament'; the <b>-j</b> <u>KEY</u> option selects `just intonation', where  <u>KEY</u>  is  an  integer  number  of
              semitones  relative  to  A (so for example, -9 or 3 selects the key of C), or a note in scientific
              notation.

              If <u>freq2</u> is given, then <u>len</u> must also have been given and the generated tone will be swept between
              the given frequencies.  The two given frequencies must be separated by one of the characters  `:',
              `+', `/', or `-'.  This character is used to specify the sweep function as follows:

              <b>:</b>      Linear: the tone will change by a fixed number of hertz per second.

              <b>+</b>      Square: a second-order function is used to change the tone.

              <b>/</b>      Exponential: the tone will change by a fixed number of semitones per second.

              <b>-</b>      Exponential:  as  `/',  but  initial phase always zero, and stepped (less smooth) frequency
                     changes.

              Not used for noise.

              <u>off</u> is the bias (DC-offset) of the signal in percent; default=0.

              <u>ph</u> is the phase shift in percentage of 1 cycle; default=0.  Not used for noise.

              <u>p1</u> is the percentage of each cycle that is `on' (square), or `rising' (triangle, exp,  trapezium);
              default=50 (square, triangle, exp), default=10 (trapezium), or sustain (pluck); default=40.

              <u>p2</u>  (trapezium): the percentage through each cycle at which `falling' begins; default=50. exp: the
              amplitude in multiples of 2dB; default=50, or tone-1 (pluck); default=20.

              <u>p3</u> (trapezium): the percentage through each cycle at which `falling' ends; default=60,  or  tone-2
              (pluck); default=90.

       <b>tempo</b> [<b>-q</b>] [<b>-m</b>|<b>-s</b>|<b>-l</b>] <u>factor</u> [<u>segment</u> [<u>search</u> [<u>overlap</u>]]]
              Change the audio playback speed but not its pitch. This effect uses the WSOLA algorithm. The audio
              is chopped up into segments which are then shifted in the time domain and overlapped (cross-faded)
              at points where their waveforms are most similar as determined by measurement of `least squares'.

              By  default,  linear  searches  are  used  to find the best overlapping points. If the optional <b>-q</b>
              parameter is given, tree searches are used instead. This makes the effect work more  quickly,  but
              the  result  may  not  sound  as  good.  However,  if  you must improve the processing speed, this
              generally reduces the sound quality less than reducing the search or overlap values.

              The <b>-m</b> option is used to optimize  default  values  of  segment,  search  and  overlap  for  music
              processing.

              The  <b>-s</b>  option  is  used  to  optimize  default  values of segment, search and overlap for speech
              processing.

              The <b>-l</b> option is used to optimize default values of  segment,  search  and  overlap  for  `linear'
              processing  that  tends to cause more noticeable distortion but may be useful when factor is close
              to 1.

              If -m, -s, or -l is specified, the default value of segment will be calculated  based  on  factor,
              while  default  search  and  overlap  values  are  based  on segment. Any values you provide still
              override these default values.

              <u>factor</u> gives the ratio of new tempo to the old tempo, so e.g. 1.1 speeds up the tempo by 10%,  and
              0.9 slows it down by 10%.

              The  optional <u>segment</u> parameter selects the algorithm's segment size in milliseconds.  If no other
              flags are specified, the default value is 82 and is typically suited to making  small  changes  to
              the  tempo of music. For larger changes (e.g. a factor of 2), 41 ms may give a better result.  The
              -m, -s, and -l flags will cause the segment default to be automatically adjusted based on  factor.
              For  example  using -s (for speech) with a tempo of 1.25 will calculate a default segment value of
              32.

              The optional <u>search</u> parameter gives the audio length in milliseconds over which the algorithm will
              search for overlapping points.  If no other flags are  specified,  the  default  value  is  14.68.
              Larger  values  use  more  processing time and may or may not produce better results.  A practical
              maximum is half the value of segment. Search can be reduced to cut processing time at the risk  of
              degrading  output  quality.  The  -m,  -s,  and  -l  flags  will  cause  the  search default to be
              automatically adjusted based on segment.

              The optional <u>overlap</u> parameter gives the segment overlap length in milliseconds.  Default value is
              12, but -m, -s, or -l flags automatically adjust overlap based on segment size. Increasing overlap
              increases processing time and may increase quality. A practical maximum for overlap is  the  value
              of search, with overlap typically being (at least) a little smaller then search.

              See  also  <b>speed</b>  for  an effect that changes tempo and pitch together, <b>pitch</b> and <b>bend</b> for effects
              that change pitch only, and <b>stretch</b> for an effect that changes tempo using a different algorithm.

       <b>treble</b> <u>gain</u> [<u>frequency</u>[<b>k</b>] [<u>width</u>[<b>s</b>|<b>h</b>|<b>k</b>|<b>o</b>|<b>q</b>]]]
              Apply a treble tone-control effect.  See the description of the <b>bass</b> effect for details.

       <b>tremolo</b> <u>speed</u> [<u>depth</u>]
              Apply a tremolo (low frequency amplitude modulation) effect to the audio.  The  tremolo  frequency
              in Hz is given by <u>speed</u>, and the depth as a percentage by <u>depth</u> (default 40).

       <b>trim</b> {<u>position(+)</u>}
              Cuts  portions  out  of the audio.  Any number of <u>position</u>s may be given; audio is not sent to the
              output until the first <u>position</u> is reached.   The  effect  then  alternates  between  copying  and
              discarding  audio  at  each  <u>position</u>.  Using a value of 0 for the first <u>position</u> parameter allows
              copying from the beginning of the audio.

              For example,
                 sox infile outfile trim 0 10
              will copy the first ten seconds, while
                 play infile trim 12:34 =15:00 -2:00
              and
                 play infile trim 12:34 2:26 -2:00
              will both play from 12 minutes 34 seconds into the audio up to 15 minutes into the audio  (i.e.  2
              minutes and 26 seconds long), then resume playing two minutes before the end of audio.

       <b>upsample</b> [<u>factor</u>]
              Upsample  the  signal  by an integer factor: <u>factor</u>-1 zero-value samples are inserted between each
              pair of input samples.  As a result, the original spectrum is replicated into  the  new  frequency
              space  (imaging)  and  attenuated.   This  attenuation can be compensated for by adding <b>vol</b> <u>factor</u>
              after any further processing.  The upsample effect is typically used in combination with filtering
              effects.

              For a general resampling effect with anti-imaging, see <b>rate</b>.  See also <b>downsample</b>.

       <b>vad</b> [<u>options</u>]
              Voice Activity Detector.  Attempts to trim silence and quiet background sounds from  the  ends  of
              (fairly high resolution i.e. 16-bit, 44-48kHz) recordings of speech.  The algorithm currently uses
              a  simple cepstral power measurement to detect voice, so may be fooled by other things, especially
              music.  The effect can trim only from the front of the audio, so in order to trim from  the  back,
              the <b>reverse</b> effect must also be used.  E.g.
                 play speech.wav norm vad
              to trim from the front,
                 play speech.wav norm reverse vad reverse
              to trim from the back, and
                 play speech.wav norm vad reverse vad reverse
              to  trim  from  both  ends.   The use of the <b>norm</b> effect is recommended, but remember that neither
              <b>reverse</b> nor <b>norm</b> is suitable for use with streamed audio.

              <u>Options:</u>
              Default values are shown in parenthesis.

              <b>-t</b> <u>num</u> (7)
                     The measurement level used to trigger activity detection.  This might need  to  be  changed
                     depending on the noise level, signal level and other charactistics of the input audio.

              <b>-T</b> <u>num</u> (0.25)
                     The time constant (in seconds) used to help ignore short bursts of sound.

              <b>-s</b> <u>num</u> (1)
                     The  amount  of audio (in seconds) to search for quieter/shorter bursts of audio to include
                     prior to the detected trigger point.

              <b>-g</b> <u>num</u> (0.25)
                     Allowed gap (in seconds) between quieter/shorter bursts of audio to include  prior  to  the
                     detected trigger point.

              <b>-p</b> <u>num</u> (0)
                     The  amount  of  audio  (in  seconds)  to  preserve  before the trigger point and any found
                     quieter/shorter bursts.

              <u>Advanced</u> <u>Options:</u>
              These allow fine tuning of the algorithm's internal parameters.

              <b>-b</b> <u>num</u> The algorithm (internally) uses adaptive noise estimation/reduction in order to detect  the
                     start of the wanted audio.  This option sets the time for the initial noise estimate.

              See also the <b>silence</b> effect.

       <b>vol</b> <u>gain</u> [<u>type</u> [<u>limitergain</u>]]
              Apply an amplification or an attenuation to the audio signal.  Unlike the <b>-v</b> option (which is used
              for  balancing  multiple  input  files  as they enter the SoX effects processing chain), <b>vol</b> is an
              effect like any other so can be applied anywhere, and  several  times  if  necessary,  during  the
              processing chain.

              The  amount  to  change  the  volume is given by <u>gain</u> which is interpreted, according to the given
              <u>type</u>, as follows: if <u>type</u> is <b>amplitude</b> (or is omitted), then <u>gain</u> is an amplitude (i.e. voltage or
              linear) ratio, if <b>power</b>, then a power (i.e. wattage or voltage-squared) ratio, and if <b>dB</b>,  then  a
              power change in dB.

              When  <u>type</u>  is  <b>amplitude</b> or <b>power</b>, a <u>gain</u> of 1 leaves the volume unchanged, less than 1 decreases
              it, and greater than 1 increases it; a negative <u>gain</u> inverts  the  audio  signal  in  addition  to
              adjusting its volume.

              When  <u>type</u>  is  <b>dB</b>, a <u>gain</u> of 0 leaves the volume unchanged, less than 0 decreases it, and greater
              than 0 increases it.

              See [4] for a detailed discussion on electrical (and hence audio signal) voltage and power ratios.

              Beware of <b>Clipping</b> when the increasing the volume.

              The <u>gain</u> and the <u>type</u> parameters can be concatenated if desired, e.g.  <b>vol</b> <b>10dB</b>.

              An optional <u>limitergain</u> value can be specified and should be a value much less than 1  (e.g.  0.05
              or  0.02) and is used only on peaks to prevent clipping.  Not specifying this parameter will cause
              no limiter to be used.  In verbose mode, this effect will display the percentage of the audio that
              needed to be limited.

              See also <b>gain</b> for a volume-changing effect with different capabilities, and <b>compand</b> for a dynamic-
              range compression/expansion/limiting effect.
