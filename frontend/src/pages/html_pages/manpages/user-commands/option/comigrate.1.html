</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>comigrate</b> is a tool designed to manage the migration of packages from Debian <u>unstable</u> to <u>testing</u>.  It can
       be  used  in different ways. First, it can compute which packages can migrate into testing; it can output
       either an <u>HeidiResult</u> file listing the updated contents of testing, or a set of hints that can be fed  to
       <u>Britney</u>  to  help  it  perform  the  migration.  Second,  it can output detailed reports of what prevents
       packages from migrating. Last, it can be used to interactively troubleshoot  the  migration  of  a  given
       package.

       Unless  an  alternative  command  is  given,  <b>comigrate</b>  will  perform  package  migration and output the
       corresponding <u>HeidiResult</u> file at the location indicated in the configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Commands</b>
       The default behavior of <b>comigrate</b> is to compute which packages can  migrate  from  <u>unstable</u>  to  <u>testing</u>.
       This behavior can be overriden by the options below.

       <b>--equivocal</b>
              Output  the  set  of packages that can migrate without making any package non-installable but that
              will make it impossible to install some set of packages together (package co-installability  would
              no  be  preserved).   This makes it possible to find the packages that would be allowed to migrate
              when using the <b>--inst</b> option (preserving only package installability), but that could  nonetheless
              be problematic.

       <b>--excuses</b> <u>file</u>
              Write to this HTML file a detailed explanation of why some packages cannot migrate. With the <b>--svg</b>
              option,  an  SVG graph is also included for each installability or co-installability issue (set of
              packages that one would not be able to install together anymore) that prevents the migration.  The
              <b>dot</b> tool is required to produce these graphs.

       <b>--explain</b> <u>dir</u>
              This  command  is  designed  to  produce a report that can be published over HTTP. An HTML file is
              created for each package that cannot migrate, providing a detailed explanation of why this package
              cannot migrate. A file listing co-installability issues (that is, set  of  packages  that  can  no
              longer  be  installed together) that would result from forthcoming migrations is also created. The
              <b>--popcon</b> option can be used to specify popcon data to  use  for  the  report.   The  <b>dot</b>  tool  is
              required for this command.

       <b>--migrate</b> <u>package</u>
              Compute  whether  it  is  possible  to  migrate this source package. If this is indeed possible, a
              corresponding <u>Britney</u> hint is outputted, by default on the standard output (this can be overridden
              with the <b>--hints</b> option).

       <b>--update</b>
              Initialize or update the data directory.

   <b>Common</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--arches</b> <u>lst</u>
              Comma-separated list of architectures to consider (default to all).

       <b>-c</b> <u>file</u>, <b>--config</b> <u>file</u>
              Use this Britney configuration file.

   <b>Package</b> <b>Migration</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--all-hints</b>
              Show all hints.  By default, hints consisting of a single  package  are  omitted  when  outputting
              hints.

       <b>--break</b> <u>sets</u>
              Override  the default migration constraint that set of packages that could be install together can
              still be installed together after migration (package co-installability).  This  option  allows  to
              specify  that  some  precise  set  of packages can become non co-installable (or, in the case of a
              single package, that this package can become non  installable).  This  is  crucial  to  allow  the
              migration  of  packages that are no longer compatible. The argument <u>sets</u> is a comma-separated list
              of sets of packages. Each set is either a list of binary package names separated by a vertical bar
              symbol |, or a wildcard _ standing for any package.  We explain this option through examples.  You
              can write <b>--break</b> <u>libjpeg62-dev</u> to state that  package  <u>libjpeg62-dev</u>  does  not  have  to  remain
              installable.   But it is usually better to indicate that the package should remain installable but
              that it is fine if it is no longer installable with some other packages: <b>--break</b>  <u>libjpeg62-dev,</u><b>_</b>.
              You  can  be even more precise and specify that two given packages can become incompatible, but no
              other incompatibility should be introduced: <b>--break</b> <u>parallel,moreutils</u>.  Finally, you can use  the
              vertical  bar  symbol  to factorize several sets of packages: <b>--break</b> <u>'unoconv,python-uno|docvert-</u>
              <u>libreoffice'</u> means that package <u>unoconv</u> does not have to remain installable together with  <u>python-</u>
              <u>uno</u> nor <u>docvert-libreoffice</u>.

       <b>--heidi</b> <u>HeidiResult</u>
              Write  the  result  of  package  migration  to  file <u>HeidiResult</u>.  When <u>HeidiResult</u> is <b>-</b>, write to
              standard output.  The option only make sense when no specific command is given.

       <b>--hints</b> <u>file</u>
              Output hints to this file. When <u>file</u> is <b>-</b>, write to standard output.  This disable  the  ouput  of
              the <u>HeidiResult</u> file, unless an explicit <b>--heidi</b> option is provided as well.

       <b>--inst</b> When  computing  possible migration, only preserves single package installability. This is similar
              to what <u>Britney</u> does. The default is to ensure the stronger requirement that set of packages  that
              could  be  install  together can still be installed together after migration (that is, package co-
              installability).

       <b>--offset</b> <u>n</u>
              Move <u>n</u> days into the future. This is convenient to see what packages will be able to migrate in  a
              few days.

       <b>--remove</b> <u>pkg</u>
              Compute package migration as if the source package <u>pkg</u> and its associated binary packages had been
              removed  from  <u>unstable</u>.   This  is  a  convenient  way  to  migrate an important package when its
              migration is prevented by packages of low importance.  Together with the <b>--migrate</b>  command,  this
              option can help finding out all issues preventing the migration of a given package.

   <b>Command-Specific</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--svg</b>  Include  conflict  graphs  (in SVG format) in excuse output. This option only makes sense together
              with the <b>--excuses</b> option.

       <b>--popcon</b> <u>file</u>
              Use popcon data from this file. This option only makes sense together with the <b>--explain</b> option.

       <b>--source</b> <u>url</u>
              Download package information from the given url. This option only makes sense  together  with  the
              <b>--update</b> option.

   <b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--debug</b> <u>name</u>
              Activate debug option <u>name</u>.  Use <b>--debug</b> <b>help</b> to list available debug options.

       <b>-help</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print a usage message  briefly  summarizing  the command-line options.

       <b>--input</b> <u>dir</u>
              Select the directory containing Britney data.

       <b>--no-cache</b>
              Disable on-disk caching.

       <b>--proc</b> <u>n</u>
              Provide number of processors.  Use 1 to disable concurrency.  Defaults to use all processors.

   <b>Ignored</b> <b>Options</b>
       These two <u>Britney</u> options are currently ignored and are present only for compatibility.

       <b>--control-files</b>
              Currently ignored.

       <b>-v</b>     Currently ignored.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To  get  started,  you  need  to  use  a <u>Britney</u> configuration file <u>britney.conf</u>.  The files specifies in
       particular the location of migration data (control files, hint  files,  ...).  These  data  can  then  be
       downloaded (or updated) with the command below.

          comigrate -c britney.conf --update

       Running  <b>comigrate</b>  without  option will make it behave like <u>Britney</u>: it will compute the set of packages
       that can  migrate  and  write  a  corresponding  <u>HeidiResult</u>  file  at  the  location  indicated  in  the
       configuration file.

          comigrate -c britney.conf

       By  default,  <b>comigrate</b>  is  more picky than <u>Britney</u>: it will not allow packages to migrate if any set of
       packages that could be installed together can no longer be installed together.  With the  <b>--inst</b>  option,
       <b>comigrate</b> will only check that packages remain installable, just like <u>Britney</u> does.

          comigrate -c britney.conf --inst

       Alternatively, you can get the set of <u>Britney</u> easy hints corresponding to the migration.

          comigrate -c britney.conf --hints - --all-hints

       The  <b>--migrate</b>  option will give you an explanation of why a package cannot migrate.  (If the package can
       in fact migrate, the corresponding easy hint will be printed.)

          comigrate -c britney.conf --migrate ghc

       The <b>--remove</b> and <b>--break</b> options can be used together with this option to get a clear understand of  what
       needs to be done to migrate the package.
