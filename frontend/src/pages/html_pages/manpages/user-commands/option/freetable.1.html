</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       freetable - tool for making HTML tables generation easier

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This manpage describes version 2.3 of <b>freetable</b>.

       It might be not 100% accurate if you use different version.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>freetable</b> <u>[options]</u> <u>filename</u>

       or

       <b>freetable</b> <u>[options]</u>

       Possible options are :

       <u>-h</u>, <u>--help</u>     Print usage info and exit

       <u>-V</u>, <u>--version</u>  Print version information and exit

       <u>-c</u>, <u>--comment</u>  Insert comment before every cell to point its location

       <u>-b</u>, <u>--no-nbsp</u>  Do not insert <u>&amp;nbsp;</u> to empty cells for lowered-3D apperance

       <u>-w</u>, <u>--warning</u>  Print a warning before each generated table that you should not change it. You should
       change its source.

       <u>-l</u>, <u>--location</u> Substitute <u>&lt;row&gt;</u> and <u>&lt;col&gt;</u> flags inside table with correct cell's location

       <u>-m</u>, <u>--macro</u> <u>[program]</u>
                      Use macro procesor to proces cells content (default: <b>m4</b>)

</pre><h4><b>WARNING</b></h4><pre>
        DO NOT USE MACRO PROCESSOR OVER UNSURE SOURCE
        M4 MAY BE USED TO COMPROMISE YOUR SECURITY
        FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THIS EXEC :

       <u>info</u> <u>m4</u> <u>'UNIX</u> <u>commands'</u> <u>syscmd</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is free replacement of <b>wwwtable</b>

       HTML is great language, but have one horrible flaw : tables. I spent many hours looking at HTML source I
       just written and trying to guess which cell in source is which in browser.

       If this also describes you, then read this manpage and your pain will stop.

       Program read HTML source from either <u>stdin</u> or file. Then it searches for line starting table:

           &lt;wwwtable [options]&gt;

       Then it analyzes table, put correct HTML table in this place and continue searching for the next table.

</pre><h4><b>TABLE</b> <b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       It is very easy:

           wwwtable :
           &lt;wwwtable [wwwtable_options]&gt;
           [preamble]
           [cell]
           [cell]
           ...
           &lt;/wwwtable&gt;

       wwwtable_options will be passed to <u>&lt;table&gt;</u> tags. There is no magic inside preamble. It can be any HTML
       text. It will be simply put in front of table.

       cell is either normal_cell (<u>&lt;td&gt;</u> tag) or header_cell (<u>&lt;th&gt;</u> tag).  At least it was this way in freetable
       1.x.  See the next section for alternative cell address syntax.

           normal_cell :
           (row,col) cell_options
           cell_content

           header_cell :
           ((row,col)) cell_options
           cell_content

       cell_options will be passed to cell tag. There is magic inside <u>colspan</u> and <u>rowspan</u> keys are parsed to
       make correct table.

       cell_content can be anything. It may contain text, tags, and even nested wwwtables.

       If you use <u>-m</u> (or <u>--macro</u>) option, it will be passed thru <b><a href="../man1/m4.1.html">m4</a></b>(1), with &lt;row&gt; and &lt;col&gt; set to adress of
       curent cell

       row and col are either numbers locating cells, expressions relative to previous cell or regular
       expresions to match few of them. Unlike <b>wwwtable</b>, <b>freetable</b> can use regular expresions for header cells.
       Also <u>*</u> can be used, and it mean <u>.*</u> really.

       Relative expressions are :

       <u>=</u> or empty means : the same as previous

       <u>+</u> or <u>+X</u> means : one and X more than previous

       <u>-</u> or <u>-X</u> means : one and X less than previous

       If many definisions adress the same cell all options and contents are concatenated in order of apperance.

       If you want to use only regular expresions you must tell program about the last cell :

           &lt;wwwtable&gt;
           (*,1)
           these are colums 1
           (1,*)
           these are rows 1
           (4,4)
           &lt;/wwwtable&gt;

</pre><h4><b>ALTERNATIVE</b> <b>CELL</b> <b>ADDRESS</b> <b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       It is inconvenient to specify cell address as regular expression.  So in <b>freetable</b> 2.0 two new methods
       were introduced.  Both can be used to either normal or header cells.

       Full bakward compatibility is preserved.  To preserve it, new syntax had to be introduced.
       Unfortunatelly, you can't specify row address using one method, and column address using another.  To
       come around this, both new methods are very liberal and allow you to use <u>=</u>, <u>+</u>, <u>-</u>, <u>+X</u> <u>-X</u> and null string
       with the same meaning as they have in old addressing method.

       Unlike regular expression method, new methods will find out the last cell automatically.

   <b>EXPLICIT</b> <b>RANGES</b>
           (rowrange;colrange) cell_options
           cell_content

       Syntax for both rowrange and colrange is like: 1-2,4-7,9,12.  Duplicates will be eliminated. For purpose
       of relative addresses last given number is used. So if you write

           (1-100,32;1)
           foo
           (+,)
           bar

       Cell (33,1) will contain `foobar' and all others only `foo'.

   <b>ARBITRARY</b> <b>PERL</b> <b>CODE</b>
           ({code for rows},{code for tables}) cell_options
           cell_content

       You can use arbitrary Perl one-liner as long as it matches our not very intelligent regular expressions
       and evaluates to list.  Unfortunatelly there isn't any regular expression for Perl code, but as long as
       it doesn't contain <u>},{</u> and <u>})</u> it should work.  Example:

           &lt;wwwtable&gt;
           ({grep {$_%3 == 1} 1..100},{1..2,4})
           foo
           &lt;/wwwtable&gt;

       Will evaluate to 100 rows x 4 columns table with `foo' in every 1st, 2nd and 4th column of every row with
       number equal 1 modulo 3.

       If you want to use "arbitrary code" in one part of address and explicit range in the other, change <u>-</u> into
       <u>..</u> in defenition of range, and put in between <u>{</u> and <u>}</u>.

       If you want to use "arbitrary code" in one part of address and regular expression in the other, you have
       to write <u>{grep</u> <u>{/expression/}</u> <u>from..to}</u>.  Unfortunatelly, in this case you have to specify size of the
       table explicitely.

</pre><h4><b>INCOMPATIBILITIES</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>WWWTABLE</b></h4><pre>
       If you was formerly user of <b>wwwtable</b> and want to change your tool, you should read this. Most of this is
       about regexps handling.  Notice also that <b>wwwtable</b> couldnt do location tags substitution nor
       macroprocesing.

       Option <u>-w</u> has completely oposite meaning. We dont print warnings by default, and <u>-w</u> or <u>--warning</u> is used
       to force warnings.

       Table header fields can be specified by regexps ex :

           ((1,*))

       It was impossible in <b>wwwtable</b>.

       Axis counters are 100% orthogonal. This mean that code :

           (*,1) width=30
           (*,2) width=35
           (*,3) width=40
           (=,=)
           Foo

       Foo will appear in 3rd column. If you wanted it to be in 1st you should write :

           (*,1) width=30
           (*,2) width=35
           (*,3) width=40
           (=,1)
           Foo

       or

           (*,) width=30
           (*,+) width=35
           (*,+) width=40
           (=,1)
           Foo

       In <b>freetable</b> 2.0 two new methods o specifying cell address were introduced. They are completely
       incompatible with <b>wwwtable</b>.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       "Arbitrary Perl Code" cell address will fail on very complex Perl code.
