       debdiff - compare file lists in two Debian packages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>debdiff</b> [<u>options</u>]
       <b>debdiff</b> [<u>options</u>] ... <u>deb1</u> <u>deb2</u>
       <b>debdiff</b> [<u>options</u>] ... <u>changes1</u> <u>changes2</u>
       <b>debdiff</b> [<u>options</u>] ... <b>--from</b> <u>deb1a</u> <u>deb1b</u> <u>...</u>  <b>--to</b> <u>deb2a</u> <u>deb2b</u> <u>...</u>
       <b>debdiff</b> [<u>options</u>] ... <u>dsc1</u> <u>dsc2</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>debdiff</b>  takes  the  names of two Debian package files (<u>.deb</u>s or <u>.udeb</u>s) on the command line and compares
       their contents (considering only the files in the main package, not the maintenance scripts).   It  shows
       which files have been introduced and which removed between the two package files, and is therefore useful
       for  spotting  files  which  may  have been inadvertently lost between revisions of the package.  It also
       checks the file owners and permissions, and compares the control files of  the  two  packages  using  the
       <b>wdiff</b>  program.   If  you want a deeper comparison of two Debian package files you can use the <b>diffoscope</b>
       tool.

       If no arguments are given, <b>debdiff</b> tries to compare the content of the current source directory with  the
       last version of the package.

       <b>debdiff</b>  can  also  handle changes between groups of <u>.deb</u> files in two ways.  The first is to specify two
       <u>.changes</u> files.  In this case, the <u>.deb</u> files listed in the <u>.changes</u> file will be compared, by taking the
       contents of all of the listed <u>.deb</u> files together.  (The <u>.deb</u> files listed are assumed to be in the  same
       directory as the <u>.changes</u> file.)  The second way is to list the <u>.deb</u> files of interest specifically using
       the  <b>--from</b>  ...  <b>--to</b>  syntax.   These both help if a package is broken up into smaller packages and one
       wishes to ensure that nothing is lost in the interim.

       <b>debdiff</b> examines the <b>devscripts</b> configuration files as described below.  Command  line  options  override
       the configuration file settings, though.

       If  <b>debdiff</b>  is  passed  two  source  packages  (<u>.dsc</u>  files)  it will compare the contents of the source
       packages.  If the source packages differ only in Debian revision number (that is, the <u>.orig.tar.gz</u>  files
       are  the  same  in  the two <u>.dsc</u> files), then <b><a href="../man1/interdiff.1.html">interdiff</a></b>(1) will be used to compare the two patch files if
       this program is available on the system, otherwise a <b>diff</b> will be performed between the two source trees.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--dirs</b>, <b>-d</b>
              The default mode of operation is to ignore directory names which appear  in  the  file  list,  but
              they, too, will be considered if this option is given.

       <b>--nodirs</b>
              Ignore  directory  names which appear in the file list.  This is the default and it can be used to
              override a configuration file setting.

       <b>--move</b> <u>FROM</u> <u>TO</u>, <b>-m</b> <u>FROM</u> <u>TO</u>
              It sometimes occurs that various files or directories are moved around  between  revisions.   This
              can  be  handled using this option.  There are two arguments, the first giving the location of the
              directory or file in the first package, and the second in the second.   Any  files  in  the  first
              listing  whose  names begin with the first argument are treated as having that substituted for the
              second argument when the file lists are compared.  Any number of <b>--move</b> arguments  may  be  given;
              they are processed in the order in which they appear. This only affects comparing binary packages,
              not source packages.

       <b>--move-regex</b> <u>FROM</u> <u>TO</u>
              This  is  the  same  as  <b>--move</b>,  except that <u>FROM</u> is treated as a regular expression and the <b>perl</b>
              substitution command <u>s/^FROM/TO/</u> is applied to the files.  In  particular,  TO  can  make  use  of
              backreferences such as $1.

       <b>--nocontrol</b>
              <b>debdiff</b>  will  usually  compare the respective control files of the packages using <b><a href="../man1/wdiff.1.html">wdiff</a></b>(1).  This
              option suppresses this part of the processing.

       <b>--control</b>
              Compare the respective control files; this is the default, and  it  can  be  used  to  override  a
              configuration file setting.

       <b>--controlfiles</b> <u>FILE</u>[<b>,</b><u>FILE</u> ...]
              Specify  which  control  files  to  compare;  by  default  this is just <u>control</u>, but could include
              <u>postinst</u>, <u>config</u> and so on.  Files will only be compared if they are present in both  <u>.debs</u>  being
              compared.   The  special value <u>ALL</u> compares all control files present in both packages, except for
              md5sums.  This option can be used to override a configuration file setting.

       <b>--wdiff-source-control</b>
              When processing source packages, compare control files using <b>wdiff</b>.  Equivalent to  the  <b>--control</b>
              option for binary packages.

       <b>--no-wdiff-source-control</b>
              Do not compare control files in source packages using <b>wdiff</b>.  This is the default.

       <b>--wp</b>, <b>--wl</b>, <b>--wt</b>
              Pass a <b>-p</b>, <b>-l</b> or <b>-t</b> option to <b>wdiff</b> respectively.  (This yields the whole <b>wdiff</b> output rather than
              just the lines with any changes.)

       <b>--show-moved</b>
              If  multiple  <u>.deb</u>  files  are  specified  on the command line, either using <u>.changes</u> files or the
              <b>--from</b>/<b>--to</b> syntax, then this option will also show  which  files  (if  any)  have  moved  between
              packages.  (The package names are simply determined from the names of the <u>.deb</u> files.)

       <b>--noshow-moved</b>
              The default behaviour; can be used to override a configuration file setting.

       <b>--renamed</b> <u>FROM</u> <u>TO</u>
              If  <b>--show-moved</b>  is  being  used  and  a  package  has  been renamed in the process, this command
              instructs <b>debdiff</b> to treat the package in the first list called <u>FROM</u> as  if  it  were  called  <u>TO</u>.
              Multiple uses of this option are permitted.

       <b>--exclude</b> <u>PATTERN</u>
              Exclude  files  whose  basenames match <u>PATTERN</u>.  Multiple uses of this option are permitted.  Note
              that this option is passed on to <b>diff</b> and has the same behaviour, so only the basename of the file
              is considered: in particular, <b>--exclude='*.patch'</b> will work, but <b>--exclude='debian/patches/*'</b> will
              have no practical effect.

       <b>--diffstat</b>
              Include the result of <b>diffstat</b> before the generated diff.

       <b>--no-diffstat</b>
              The default behaviour; can be used to override a configuration file setting.

       <b>--auto-ver-sort</b>
              When comparing source packages, do so in version order.

       <b>--no-auto-ver-sort</b>
              Compare source packages in the order they were passed on the  command-line,  even  if  that  means
              comparing  a  package with a higher version against one with a lower version.  This is the default
              behaviour.

       <b>--unpack-tarballs</b>
              When comparing source packages, also unpack tarballs found in the top level  source  directory  to
              compare their contents along with the other files.  This is the default behaviour.

       <b>--no-unpack-tarballs</b>
              Do not unpack tarballs inside source packages.

       <b>--apply-patches</b>
              If  the old and/or new package is in 3.0 (quilt) format, apply the quilt patches (and remove <b>.pc/</b>)
              before comparison.

       <b>--no-apply-patches,</b> <b>--noapply-patches</b>
              If the old and/or new package is in 3.0 (quilt) format, do not  apply  the  quilt  patches  before
              comparison. This is the default behaviour.

       <b>--no-conf</b>, <b>--noconf</b>
              Do  not  read  any  configuration  files.   This can only be used as the first option given on the
              command-line.

       <b>--debs-dir</b> <u>directory</u>
              Look for the <u>.dsc</u> files in <u>directory</u> instead of the parent of the source directory.   This  should
              either be an absolute path or relative to the top of the source directory.

       <b>--help</b>, <b>-h</b>
              Show a summary of options.

       <b>--version</b>, <b>-v</b>
              Show version and copyright information.

       <b>--quiet</b>, <b>-q</b>
              Be quiet if no differences were found.

       <b>--ignore-space</b>, <b>-w</b>
              Ignore whitespace in diffs.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  two  configuration files <u>/etc/devscripts.conf</u> and <u><a href="file:~/.devscripts">~/.devscripts</a></u> are sourced by a shell in that order
       to set configuration variables.  Command  line  options  can  be  used  to  override  configuration  file
       settings.   Environment  variable  settings  are  ignored  for  this  purpose.   The currently recognised
       variables are:

       <b>DEBDIFF_DIRS</b>
              If this is set to <u>yes</u>, then it is the same as the <b>--dirs</b> command line parameter being used.

       <b>DEBDIFF_CONTROL</b>
              If this is set to <u>no</u>, then it is the same as the <b>--nocontrol</b> command line  parameter  being  used.
              The default is <u>yes</u>.

       <b>DEBDIFF_CONTROLFILES</b>
              Which  control  files  to  compare,  corresponding to the <b>--controlfiles</b> command line option.  The
              default is <u>control</u>.

       <b>DEBDIFF_SHOW_MOVED</b>
              If this is set to <u>yes</u>, then it is the same as the <b>--show-moved</b> command line parameter being used.

       <b>DEBDIFF_WDIFF_OPT</b>
              This option will be passed to <b>wdiff</b>; it should be one of <b>-p</b>, <b>-l</b> or <b>-t</b>.

       <b>DEBDIFF_SHOW_DIFFSTAT</b>
              If this is set to <u>yes</u>, then it is the same as the <b>--diffstat</b> command line parameter being used.

       <b>DEBDIFF_WDIFF_SOURCE_CONTROL</b>
              If this is set to <u>yes</u>, then it is the same as the <b>--wdiff-source-control</b>  command  line  parameter
              being used.

       <b>DEBDIFF_AUTO_VER_SORT</b>
              If  this  is  set  to <u>yes</u>, then it is the same as the <b>--auto-ver-sort</b> command line parameter being
              used.

       <b>DEBDIFF_UNPACK_TARBALLS</b>
              If this is set to <u>no</u>, then it is the same as the <b>--no-unpack-tarballs</b> command line parameter being
              used.

       <b>DEBDIFF_APPLY_PATCHES</b>
              If this is set to <u>yes</u>, then it is the same as the <b>--apply-patches</b>  command  line  parameter  being
              used.  The default is <u>no</u>.

       <b>DEBRELEASE_DEBS_DIR</b>
              This  specifies  the  directory in which to look for the <u>.dsc</u> and files, and is either an absolute
              path or relative to the top of the source tree.  This corresponds to the <b>--debs-dir</b>  command  line
              option.  This directive could be used, for example, if you always use <b>pbuilder</b> or <b>svn-buildpackage</b>
              to  build  your  packages.   Note  that  it  also affects <b><a href="../man1/debrelease.1.html">debrelease</a></b>(1) in the same way, hence the
              strange name of the option.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       Normally the exit value will be 0 if no differences are reported and 1 if any are reported.  If there  is
       some fatal error, the exit code will be 255.
