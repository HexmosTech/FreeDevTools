</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gcc - GNU project C and C++ compiler

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       gcc [<b>-c</b>|<b>-S</b>|<b>-E</b>] [<b>-std=</b><u>standard</u>]
           [<b>-g</b>] [<b>-pg</b>] [<b>-O</b><u>level</u>]
           [<b>-W</b><u>warn</u>...] [<b>-Wpedantic</b>]
           [<b>-I</b><u>dir</u>...] [<b>-L</b><u>dir</u>...]
           [<b>-D</b><u>macro</u>[=<u>defn</u>]...] [<b>-U</b><u>macro</u>]
           [<b>-f</b><u>option</u>...] [<b>-m</b><u>machine-option</u>...]
           [<b>-o</b> <u>outfile</u>] [@<u>file</u>] <u>infile</u>...

       Only the most useful options are listed here; see below for the remainder.  <b>g++</b> accepts mostly the same
       options as <b>gcc</b>.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking.  The "overall
       options" allow you to stop this process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the <b>-c</b> option says not to
       run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files output by the assembler.

       Other options are passed on to one or more stages of processing.  Some options control the preprocessor
       and others the compiler itself.  Yet other options control the assembler and linker; most of these are
       not documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.

       Most of the command-line options that you can use with GCC are useful for C programs; when an option is
       only useful with another language (usually C++), the explanation says so explicitly.  If the description
       for a particular option does not mention a source language, you can use that option with all supported
       languages.

       The usual way to run GCC is to run the executable called <b>gcc</b>, or <u>machine</u><b>-gcc</b> when cross-compiling, or
       <u>machine</u><b>-gcc-</b><u>version</u> to run a specific version of GCC.  When you compile C++ programs, you should invoke
       GCC as <b>g++</b> instead.

       The <b>gcc</b> program accepts options and file names as operands.  Many options have multi-letter names;
       therefore multiple single-letter options may <u>not</u> be grouped: <b>-dv</b> is very different from <b>-d</b> <b>-v</b>.

       You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the order you use doesn't matter.  Order
       does matter when you use several options of the same kind; for example, if you specify <b>-L</b> more than once,
       the directories are searched in the order specified.  Also, the placement of the <b>-l</b> option is
       significant.

       Many options have long names starting with <b>-f</b> or with <b>-W</b>---for example, <b>-fmove-loop-invariants</b>, <b>-Wformat</b>
       and so on.  Most of these have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of <b>-ffoo</b> is <b>-fno-foo</b>.
       This manual documents only one of these two forms, whichever one is not the default.

       Some options take one or more arguments typically separated either by a space or by the equals sign (<b>=</b>)
       from the option name.  Unless documented otherwise, an argument can be either numeric or a string.
       Numeric arguments must typically be small unsigned decimal or hexadecimal integers.  Hexadecimal
       arguments must begin with the <b>0x</b> prefix.  Arguments to options that specify a size threshold of some sort
       may be arbitrarily large decimal or hexadecimal integers followed by a byte size suffix designating a
       multiple of bytes such as "kB" and "KiB" for kilobyte and kibibyte, respectively, "MB" and "MiB" for
       megabyte and mebibyte, "GB" and "GiB" for gigabyte and gigibyte, and so on.  Such arguments are
       designated by <u>byte-size</u> in the following text.  Refer to the NIST, IEC, and other relevant national and
       international standards for the full listing and explanation of the binary and decimal byte size
       prefixes.

       Compilation  can  involve  up  to  four  stages: preprocessing, compilation proper, assembly and linking,
       always in that order.  GCC is capable of preprocessing and compiling several files  either  into  several
       assembler  input  files,  or  into  one  assembler input file; then each assembler input file produces an
       object file, and linking combines all the object files (those newly  compiled,  and  those  specified  as
       input) into an executable file.

       For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind of compilation is done:

       <u>file</u><b>.c</b>
           C source code that must be preprocessed.

       <u>file</u><b>.i</b>
           C source code that should not be preprocessed.

       <u>file</u><b>.ii</b>
           C++ source code that should not be preprocessed.

       <u>file</u><b>.m</b>
           Objective-C  source  code.   Note  that you must link with the <u>libobjc</u> library to make an Objective-C
           program work.

       <u>file</u><b>.mi</b>
           Objective-C source code that should not be preprocessed.

       <u>file</u><b>.mm</b>
       <u>file</u><b>.M</b>
           Objective-C++ source code.  Note that you must link with the <u>libobjc</u> library to make an Objective-C++
           program work.  Note that <b>.M</b> refers to a literal capital M.

       <u>file</u><b>.mii</b>
           Objective-C++ source code that should not be preprocessed.

       <u>file</u><b>.h</b>
           C, C++, Objective-C or Objective-C++ header file to be turned into a precompiled header (default), or
           C, C++ header file to be turned into an Ada spec (via the <b>-fdump-ada-spec</b> switch).

       <u>file</u><b>.cc</b>
       <u>file</u><b>.cp</b>

       <u>file</u><b>.cpp</b>
       <u>file</u><b>.CPP</b>
       <u>file</u><b>.c++</b>
       <u>file</u><b>.C</b>
           C++ source code that must be preprocessed.  Note that in <b>.cxx</b>, the last  two  letters  must  both  be
           literally <b>x</b>.  Likewise, <b>.C</b> refers to a literal capital C.

       <u>file</u><b>.mm</b>
       <u>file</u><b>.M</b>
           Objective-C++ source code that must be preprocessed.

       <u>file</u><b>.mii</b>
           Objective-C++ source code that should not be preprocessed.

       <u>file</u><b>.hh</b>
       <u>file</u><b>.H</b>
       <u>file</u><b>.hp</b>
       <u>file</u><b>.hxx</b>

       <u>file</u><b>.HPP</b>
       <u>file</u><b>.h++</b>
       <u>file</u><b>.tcc</b>
           C++ header file to be turned into a precompiled header or Ada spec.

       <u>file</u><b>.f</b>
       <u>file</u><b>.for</b>
       <u>file</u><b>.ftn</b>
           Fixed form Fortran source code that should not be preprocessed.

       <u>other</u>
           An object file to be fed straight into linking.  Any file name with no recognized suffix  is  treated
           this way.

       You can specify the input language explicitly with the <b>-x</b> option:

       <b>-x</b> <u>language</u>
           Specify  explicitly  the  <u>language</u>  for  the  following input files (rather than letting the compiler
           choose a default based on the file name suffix).  This option applies to all  following  input  files
           until the next <b>-x</b> option.  Possible values for <u>language</u> are:

                   c  c-header  cpp-output
                   c++  c++-header  c++-system-header c++-user-header c++-cpp-output
                   objective-c  objective-c-header  objective-c-cpp-output
                   objective-c++ objective-c++-header objective-c++-cpp-output
                   assembler  assembler-with-cpp
                   ada
                   d
                   f77  f77-cpp-input f95  f95-cpp-input
                   go
                   brig

       <b>-x</b> <b>none</b>
           Turn  off  any  specification  of a language, so that subsequent files are handled according to their
           file name suffixes (as they are if <b>-x</b> has not been used at all).

       If you only want some of the stages of compilation, you can use <b>-x</b> (or filename  suffixes)  to  tell  <b>gcc</b>
       where  to  start,  and  one  of  the  options  <b>-c</b>, <b>-S</b>, or <b>-E</b> to say where <b>gcc</b> is to stop.  Note that some
       combinations (for example, <b>-x</b> <b>cpp-output</b> <b>-E</b>) instruct <b>gcc</b> to do nothing at all.

       <b>-c</b>  Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The linking stage simply is  not  done.   The
           ultimate output is in the form of an object file for each source file.

           By  default, the object file name for a source file is made by replacing the suffix <b>.c</b>, <b>.i</b>, <b>.s</b>, etc.,
           with <b>.o</b>.

           Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or assembly, are ignored.

       <b>-S</b>  Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble.   The  output  is  in  the  form  of  an
           assembler code file for each non-assembler input file specified.

           By  default,  the assembler file name for a source file is made by replacing the suffix <b>.c</b>, <b>.i</b>, etc.,
           with <b>.s</b>.

           Input files that don't require compilation are ignored.

       <b>-E</b>  Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler proper.  The output is  in  the  form  of
           preprocessed source code, which is sent to the standard output.

           Input files that don't require preprocessing are ignored.

       <b>-o</b> <u>file</u>
           Place  the  primary  output in file <u>file</u>.  This applies to whatever sort of output is being produced,
           whether it be an executable file, an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.

           If <b>-o</b> is not specified, the default is to put an executable  file  in  <u>a.out</u>,  the  object  file  for
           <u>source.suffix</u>   in   <u>source.o</u>,  its  assembler  file  in  <u>source.s</u>,  a  precompiled  header  file  in
           <u>source.suffix.gch</u>, and all preprocessed C source on standard output.

           Though <b>-o</b> names only the primary output, it also affects the naming of auxiliary  and  dump  outputs.
           See the examples below.  Unless overridden, both auxiliary outputs and dump outputs are placed in the
           same directory as the primary output.  In auxiliary outputs, the suffix of the input file is replaced
           with that of the auxiliary output file type; in dump outputs, the suffix of the dump file is appended
           to  the input file suffix.  In compilation commands, the base name of both auxiliary and dump outputs
           is that of the primary output; in compile and link commands,  the  primary  output  name,  minus  the
           executable  suffix,  is  combined  with  the  input  file  name.   If  both share the same base name,
           disregarding the suffix, the result of the  combination  is  that  base  name,  otherwise,  they  are
           concatenated, separated by a dash.

                   gcc -c foo.c ...

           will  use  <u>foo.o</u>  as  the  primary output, and place aux outputs and dumps next to it, e.g., aux file
           <u>foo.dwo</u> for <b>-gsplit-dwarf</b>, and dump file <u>foo.c.???r.final</u> for <b>-fdump-rtl-final</b>.

           If a non-linker output file is explicitly specified, aux and dump files by default take the same base
           name:

                   gcc -c foo.c -o dir/foobar.o ...

           will name aux outputs <u>dir/foobar.*</u> and dump outputs <u>dir/foobar.c.*</u>.

           A linker output will instead prefix aux and dump outputs:

                   gcc foo.c bar.c -o dir/foobar ...

           will  generally  name  aux  outputs  <u>dir/foobar-foo.*</u>  and   <u>dir/foobar-bar.*</u>,   and   dump   outputs
           <u>dir/foobar-foo.c.*</u> and <u>dir/foobar-bar.c.*</u>.

           The one exception to the above is when the executable shares the base name with the single input:

                   gcc foo.c -o dir/foo ...

           in which case aux outputs are named <u>dir/foo.*</u> and dump outputs named <u>dir/foo.c.*</u>.

           The  location  and  the names of auxiliary and dump outputs can be adjusted by the options <b>-dumpbase</b>,
           <b>-dumpbase-ext</b>, <b>-dumpdir</b>, <b>-save-temps=cwd</b>, and <b>-save-temps=obj</b>.

       <b>-dumpbase</b> <u>dumpbase</u>
           This option sets the base name for auxiliary and dump output files.  It does not affect the  name  of
           the  primary output file.  Intermediate outputs, when preserved, are not regarded as primary outputs,
           but as auxiliary outputs:

                   gcc -save-temps -S foo.c

           saves the (no longer) temporary preprocessed file in <u>foo.i</u>, and then compiles to the (implied) output
           file <u>foo.s</u>, whereas:

                   gcc -save-temps -dumpbase save-foo -c foo.c

           preprocesses to in <u>save-foo.i</u>, compiles to <u>save-foo.s</u> (now an intermediate, thus  auxiliary  output),
           and then assembles to the (implied) output file <u>foo.o</u>.

           Absent this option, dump and aux files take their names from the input file, or from the (non-linker)
           output  file,  if  one  is  explicitly specified: dump output files (e.g. those requested by <b>-fdump-*</b>
           options) with the input name suffix, and aux output files (those requested by other non-dump options,
           e.g. "-save-temps", "-gsplit-dwarf", "-fcallgraph-info") without it.

           Similar suffix differentiation of dump and aux outputs can be attained for explicitly-given <b>-dumpbase</b>
           <b>basename.suf</b> by also specifying <b>-dumpbase-ext</b> <b>.suf</b>.

           If <u>dumpbase</u> is explicitly specified with any directory component,  any  <u>dumppfx</u>  specification  (e.g.
           <b>-dumpdir</b> or <b>-save-temps=*</b>) is ignored, and instead of appending to it, <u>dumpbase</u> fully overrides it:

                   gcc foo.c -c -o dir/foo.o -dumpbase alt/foo \
                     -dumpdir pfx- -save-temps=cwd ...

           creates auxiliary and dump outputs named <u>alt/foo.*</u>, disregarding <u>dir/</u> in <b>-o</b>, the <u>./</u> prefix implied by
           <b>-save-temps=cwd</b>, and <u>pfx-</u> in <b>-dumpdir</b>.

           When  <b>-dumpbase</b>  is  specified  in a command that compiles multiple inputs, or that compiles and then
           links, it may be combined with <u>dumppfx</u>, as specified  under  <b>-dumpdir</b>.   Then,  each  input  file  is
           compiled  using the combined <u>dumppfx</u>, and default values for <u>dumpbase</u> and <u>auxdropsuf</u> are computed for
           each input file:

                   gcc foo.c bar.c -c -dumpbase main ...

           creates <u>foo.o</u> and <u>bar.o</u> as primary outputs, and avoids overwriting the auxiliary and dump outputs  by
           using the <u>dumpbase</u> as a prefix, creating auxiliary and dump outputs named <u>main-foo.*</u>  and <u>main-bar.*</u>.

           An  empty  string  specified as <u>dumpbase</u> avoids the influence of the output basename in the naming of
           auxiliary and dump outputs during compilation, computing default values :

                   gcc -c foo.c -o dir/foobar.o -dumpbase " ...

           will name aux outputs <u>dir/foo.*</u> and dump outputs <u>dir/foo.c.*</u>.  Note how  their  basenames  are  taken
           from the input name, but the directory still defaults to that of the output.

           The empty-string dumpbase does not prevent the use of the output basename for outputs during linking:

                   gcc foo.c bar.c -o dir/foobar -dumpbase " -flto ...

           The  compilation  of  the  source files will name auxiliary outputs <u>dir/foo.*</u> and <u>dir/bar.*</u>, and dump
           outputs <u>dir/foo.c.*</u> and <u>dir/bar.c.*</u>.  LTO recompilation during linking will use  <u>dir/foobar.</u>  as  the
           prefix for dumps and auxiliary files.

       <b>-dumpbase-ext</b> <u>auxdropsuf</u>
           When  forming  the  name  of an auxiliary (but not a dump) output file, drop trailing <u>auxdropsuf</u> from
           <u>dumpbase</u> before appending any suffixes.  If not specified, this option defaults to the  suffix  of  a
           default  <u>dumpbase</u>,  i.e.,  the  suffix of the input file when <b>-dumpbase</b> is not present in the command
           line, or <u>dumpbase</u> is combined with <u>dumppfx</u>.

                   gcc foo.c -c -o dir/foo.o -dumpbase x-foo.c -dumpbase-ext .c ...

           creates <u>dir/foo.o</u> as the main output, and generates auxiliary  outputs  in  <u>dir/x-foo.*</u>,  taking  the
           location  of  the  primary output, and dropping the <u>.c</u> suffix from the <u>dumpbase</u>.  Dump outputs retain
           the suffix: <u>dir/x-foo.c.*</u>.

           This option is disregarded if it does not match the suffix of a  specified  <u>dumpbase</u>,  except  as  an
           alternative  to  the  executable  suffix  when  appending  the linker output base name to <u>dumppfx</u>, as
           specified below:

                   gcc foo.c bar.c -o main.out -dumpbase-ext .out ...

           creates <u>main.out</u> as the primary output, and avoids overwriting the  auxiliary  and  dump  outputs  by
           using  the  executable name minus <u>auxdropsuf</u> as a prefix, creating auxiliary outputs named <u>main-foo.*</u>
           and <u>main-bar.*</u> and dump outputs named <u>main-foo.c.*</u> and <u>main-bar.c.*</u>.

       <b>-dumpdir</b> <u>dumppfx</u>
           When forming the name of an auxiliary or dump output file, use <u>dumppfx</u> as a prefix:

                   gcc -dumpdir pfx- -c foo.c ...

           creates <u>foo.o</u> as the primary output, and auxiliary  outputs  named  <u>pfx-foo.*</u>,  combining  the  given
           <u>dumppfx</u>  with  the default <u>dumpbase</u> derived from the default primary output, derived in turn from the
           input name.  Dump outputs also take the input name suffix: <u>pfx-foo.c.*</u>.

           If <u>dumppfx</u> is to be used as a directory name, it must end with a directory separator:

                   gcc -dumpdir dir/ -c foo.c -o obj/bar.o ...

           creates <u>obj/bar.o</u> as the primary output, and auxiliary outputs named <u>dir/bar.*</u>, combining  the  given
           <u>dumppfx</u>  with  the default <u>dumpbase</u> derived from the primary output name.  Dump outputs also take the
           input name suffix: <u>dir/bar.c.*</u>.

           It defaults to the location of the output file, unless  the  output  file  is  a  special  file  like
           "/dev/null". Options <b>-save-temps=cwd</b> and <b>-save-temps=obj</b> override this default, just like an explicit
           <b>-dumpdir</b> option.  In case multiple such options are given, the last one prevails:

                   gcc -dumpdir pfx- -c foo.c -save-temps=obj ...

           outputs  <u>foo.o</u>,  with auxiliary outputs named <u>foo.*</u> because <b>-save-temps=*</b> overrides the <u>dumppfx</u> given
           by the earlier <b>-dumpdir</b> option.  It does not matter that <b>=obj</b> is the  default  for  <b>-save-temps</b>,  nor
           that the output directory is implicitly the current directory.  Dump outputs are named <u>foo.c.*</u>.

           When  compiling  from  multiple  input files, if <b>-dumpbase</b> is specified, <u>dumpbase</u>, minus a <u>auxdropsuf</u>
           suffix, and a dash are appended to (or override, if containing any directory components) an  explicit
           or  defaulted  <u>dumppfx</u>, so that each of the multiple compilations gets differently-named aux and dump
           outputs.

                   gcc foo.c bar.c -c -dumpdir dir/pfx- -dumpbase main ...

           outputs auxiliary dumps to <u>dir/pfx-main-foo.*</u> and <u>dir/pfx-main-bar.*</u>, appending <u>dumpbase</u>- to <u>dumppfx</u>.
           Dump  outputs  retain  the  input  file  suffix:  <u>dir/pfx-main-foo.c.*</u>    and   <u>dir/pfx-main-bar.c.*</u>,
           respectively.  Contrast with the single-input compilation:

                   gcc foo.c -c -dumpdir dir/pfx- -dumpbase main ...

           that,  applying  <b>-dumpbase</b>  to  a  single source, does not compute and append a separate <u>dumpbase</u> per
           input file.  Its auxiliary and dump outputs go in <u>dir/pfx-main.*</u>.

           When compiling and then linking from multiple  input  files,  a  defaulted  or  explicitly  specified
           <u>dumppfx</u>  also  undergoes  the <u>dumpbase</u>- transformation above (e.g. the compilation of <u>foo.c</u> and <u>bar.c</u>
           above, but without <b>-c</b>).  If neither <b>-dumpdir</b> nor <b>-dumpbase</b> are given, the linker  output  base  name,
           minus  <u>auxdropsuf</u>,  if  specified, or the executable suffix otherwise, plus a dash is appended to the
           default <u>dumppfx</u> instead.  Note, however, that unlike earlier cases of linking:

                   gcc foo.c bar.c -dumpdir dir/pfx- -o main ...

           does not append the output name <u>main</u> to <u>dumppfx</u>, because <b>-dumpdir</b> is explicitly specified.  The  goal
           is that the explicitly-specified <u>dumppfx</u> may contain the specified output name as part of the prefix,
           if  desired;  only  an  explicitly-specified  <b>-dumpbase</b>  would be combined with it, in order to avoid
           simply discarding a meaningful option.

           When compiling and then linking from a single input file, the linker output base name  will  only  be
           appended  to  the  default  <u>dumppfx</u> as above if it does not share the base name with the single input
           file name.  This has been covered in single-input linking cases  above,  but  not  with  an  explicit
           <b>-dumpdir</b> that inhibits the combination, even if overridden by <b>-save-temps=*</b>:

                   gcc foo.c -dumpdir alt/pfx- -o dir/main.exe -save-temps=cwd ...

           Auxiliary  outputs  are  named  <u>foo.*</u>,  and dump outputs <u>foo.c.*</u>, in the current working directory as
           ultimately requested by <b>-save-temps=cwd</b>.

           Summing it all up for an intuitive though slightly imprecise data flow: the primary  output  name  is
           broken  into a directory part and a basename part; <u>dumppfx</u> is set to the former, unless overridden by
           <b>-dumpdir</b> or <b>-save-temps=*</b>, and <u>dumpbase</u> is set to the latter,  unless  overriden  by  <b>-dumpbase</b>.   If
           there  are multiple inputs or linking, this <u>dumpbase</u> may be combined with <u>dumppfx</u> and taken from each
           input file.  Auxiliary output names for each input are formed by combining  <u>dumppfx</u>,  <u>dumpbase</u>  minus
           suffix, and the auxiliary output suffix; dump output names are only different in that the suffix from
           <u>dumpbase</u> is retained.

           When  it  comes  to  auxiliary  and  dump  outputs created during LTO recompilation, a combination of
           <u>dumppfx</u> and <u>dumpbase</u>, as given or as derived from the linker output name but not from inputs, even in
           cases in which this combination would not otherwise be used as such, is passed down with  a  trailing
           period replacing the compiler-added dash, if any, as a <b>-dumpdir</b> option to <b>lto-wrapper</b>; being involved
           in linking, this program does not normally get any <b>-dumpbase</b> and <b>-dumpbase-ext</b>, and it ignores them.

           When  running  sub-compilers, <b>lto-wrapper</b> appends LTO stage names to the received <u>dumppfx</u>, ensures it
           contains a directory component so that it overrides any <b>-dumpdir</b>, and passes  that  as  <b>-dumpbase</b>  to
           sub-compilers.

       <b>-v</b>  Print  (on standard error output) the commands executed to run the stages of compilation.  Also print
           the version number of the compiler driver program and of the preprocessor and the compiler proper.

       <b>-###</b>
           Like <b>-v</b> except the commands are not executed and  arguments  are  quoted  unless  they  contain  only
           alphanumeric  characters or "./-_".  This is useful for shell scripts to capture the driver-generated
           command lines.

       <b>--help</b>
           Print (on the standard output) a description of the command-line options understood by <b>gcc</b>.   If  the
           <b>-v</b> option is also specified then <b>--help</b> is also passed on to the various processes invoked by <b>gcc</b>, so
           that  they  can  display  the  command-line options they accept.  If the <b>-Wextra</b> option has also been
           specified (prior to the  <b>--help</b>  option),  then  command-line  options  that  have  no  documentation
           associated with them are also displayed.

       <b>--target-help</b>
           Print  (on  the standard output) a description of target-specific command-line options for each tool.
           For some targets extra target-specific information may also be printed.

       <b>--help={</b><u>class</u>|[<b>^</b>]<u>qualifier</u><b>}</b>[<b>,...</b>]
           Print (on the standard output) a description of the command-line options understood by  the  compiler
           that fit into all specified classes and qualifiers.  These are the supported classes:

           <b>optimizers</b>
               Display all of the optimization options supported by the compiler.

           <b>warnings</b>
               Display all of the options controlling warning messages produced by the compiler.

           <b>target</b>
               Display  target-specific  options.   Unlike  the  <b>--target-help</b>  option  however, target-specific
               options of the linker and assembler are not displayed.   This  is  because  those  tools  do  not
               currently support the extended <b>--help=</b> syntax.

           <b>params</b>
               Display the values recognized by the <b>--param</b> option.

           <u>language</u>
               Display  the  options  supported for <u>language</u>, where <u>language</u> is the name of one of the languages
               supported in this version of GCC.  If an option is supported  by  all  languages,  one  needs  to
               select <b>common</b> class.

           <b>common</b>
               Display the options that are common to all languages.

           These are the supported qualifiers:

           <b>undocumented</b>
               Display only those options that are undocumented.

           <b>joined</b>
               Display  options taking an argument that appears after an equal sign in the same continuous piece
               of text, such as: <b>--help=target</b>.

           <b>separate</b>
               Display options taking an argument that appears as a separate word following the original option,
               such as: <b>-o</b> <b>output-file</b>.

           Thus for example to display all the undocumented target-specific switches supported by the  compiler,
           use:

                   --help=target,undocumented

           The  sense  of  a  qualifier  can be inverted by prefixing it with the <b>^</b> character, so for example to
           display all binary warning options (i.e., ones that are either on or off and  that  do  not  take  an
           argument) that have a description, use:

                   --help=warnings,^joined,^undocumented

           The argument to <b>--help=</b> should not consist solely of inverted qualifiers.

           Combining  several classes is possible, although this usually restricts the output so much that there
           is nothing to display.  One case where it does work, however, is when one of the classes  is  <u>target</u>.
           For example, to display all the target-specific optimization options, use:

                   --help=target,optimizers

           The  <b>--help=</b>  option can be repeated on the command line.  Each successive use displays its requested
           class of options, skipping those that have already been  displayed.   If  <b>--help</b>  is  also  specified
           anywhere on the command line then this takes precedence over any <b>--help=</b> option.

           If  the  <b>-Q</b>  option  appears on the command line before the <b>--help=</b> option, then the descriptive text
           displayed by <b>--help=</b> is changed.  Instead of describing the displayed options, an indication is given
           as to whether the option is enabled, disabled or set to a specific value (assuming that the  compiler
           knows this at the point where the <b>--help=</b> option is used).

           Here is a truncated example from the ARM port of <b>gcc</b>:

                     % gcc -Q -mabi=2 --help=target -c
                     The following options are target specific:
                     -mabi=                                2
                     -mabort-on-noreturn                   [disabled]
                     -mapcs                                [disabled]

           The  output  is  sensitive  to  the  effects  of  previous command-line options, so for example it is
           possible to find out which optimizations are enabled at <b>-O2</b> by using:

                   -Q -O2 --help=optimizers

           Alternatively you can discover which binary optimizations are enabled by <b>-O3</b> by using:

                   gcc -c -Q -O3 --help=optimizers &gt; /tmp/O3-opts
                   gcc -c -Q -O2 --help=optimizers &gt; /tmp/O2-opts
                   diff /tmp/O2-opts /tmp/O3-opts | grep enabled

       <b>--version</b>
           Display the version number and copyrights of the invoked GCC.

       <b>-pass-exit-codes</b>
           Normally the <b>gcc</b> program exits with the code of 1 if any phase of the compiler returns a  non-success
           return  code.   If you specify <b>-pass-exit-codes</b>, the <b>gcc</b> program instead returns with the numerically
           highest error produced by any phase returning an error indication.  The C,  C++,  and  Fortran  front
           ends return 4 if an internal compiler error is encountered.

       <b>-pipe</b>
           Use  pipes  rather  than temporary files for communication between the various stages of compilation.
           This fails to work on some systems where the assembler is unable to read from a  pipe;  but  the  GNU
           assembler has no trouble.

       <b>-specs=</b><u>file</u>
           Process  <u>file</u>  after the compiler reads in the standard <u>specs</u> file, in order to override the defaults
           which the <b>gcc</b> driver program uses when determining what switches to pass to  <b>cc1</b>,  <b>cc1plus</b>,  <b>as</b>,  <b>ld</b>,
           etc.   More  than  one  <b>-specs=</b><u>file</u>  can  be specified on the command line, and they are processed in
           order, from left to right.

       <b>-wrapper</b>
           Invoke all subcommands under a wrapper program.  The name of the wrapper program and  its  parameters
           are passed as a comma separated list.

                   gcc -c t.c -wrapper gdb,--args

           This  invokes  all  subprograms of <b>gcc</b> under <b>gdb</b> <b>--args</b>, thus the invocation of <b>cc1</b> is <b>gdb</b> <b>--args</b> <b>cc1</b>
           <b>...</b>.

       <b>-ffile-prefix-map=</b><u>old</u><b>=</b><u>new</u>
           When compiling files residing in directory <u>old</u>, record any references to them in the  result  of  the
           compilation  as  if the files resided in directory <u>new</u> instead.  Specifying this option is equivalent
           to specifying all the individual <b>-f*-prefix-map</b> options.  This  can  be  used  to  make  reproducible
           builds that are location independent.  See also <b>-fmacro-prefix-map</b> and <b>-fdebug-prefix-map</b>.

       <b>-fplugin=</b><u>name</u><b>.so</b>
           Load  the  plugin code in file <u>name</u>.so, assumed to be a shared object to be dlopen'd by the compiler.
           The base name of the shared object file is used to identify the plugin for the purposes  of  argument
           parsing  (See  <b>-fplugin-arg-</b><u>name</u><b>-</b><u>key</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>  below).  Each plugin should define the callback functions
           specified in the Plugins API.

       <b>-fplugin-arg-</b><u>name</u><b>-</b><u>key</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>
           Define an argument called <u>key</u> with a value of <u>value</u> for the plugin called <u>name</u>.

       <b>-fdump-ada-spec</b>[<b>-slim</b>]
           For C and C++ source and include files, generate corresponding Ada specs.

       <b>-fada-spec-parent=</b><u>unit</u>
           In conjunction with <b>-fdump-ada-spec</b>[<b>-slim</b>] above, generate Ada specs as child units of parent <u>unit</u>.

       <b>-fdump-go-spec=</b><u>file</u>
           For input files in any language, generate corresponding Go declarations in <u>file</u>.  This  generates  Go
           "const",  "type",  "var",  and  "func"  declarations  which may be a useful way to start writing a Go
           interface to code written in some other language.

       <b>@</b><u>file</u>
           Read command-line options from <u>file</u>.  The options read are inserted in place of  the  original  @<u>file</u>
           option.   If  <u>file</u>  does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and
           not removed.

           Options in <u>file</u> are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace character may be included in an option  by
           surrounding  the  entire  option  in  either  single  or  double  quotes.  Any character (including a
           backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included with a backslash.  The <u>file</u>  may
           itself contain additional @<u>file</u> options; any such options will be processed recursively.

   <b>Compiling</b> <b>C++</b> <b>Programs</b>
       C++  source  files  conventionally  use  one of the suffixes <b>.C</b>, <b>.cc</b>, <b>.cpp</b>, <b>.CPP</b>, <b>.c++</b>, <b>.cp</b>, or <b>.cxx</b>; C++
       header files often use <b>.hh</b>, <b>.hpp</b>, <b>.H</b>, or (for shared template code) <b>.tcc</b>; and preprocessed C++ files  use
       the suffix <b>.ii</b>.  GCC recognizes files with these names and compiles them as C++ programs even if you call
       the compiler the same way as for compiling C programs (usually with the name <b>gcc</b>).

       However,  the use of <b>gcc</b> does not add the C++ library.  <b>g++</b> is a program that calls GCC and automatically
       specifies linking against the C++ library.  It treats <b>.c</b>, <b>.h</b> and <b>.i</b> files as C++ source files instead  of
       C  source  files unless <b>-x</b> is used.  This program is also useful when precompiling a C header file with a
       <b>.h</b> extension for use in C++ compilations.  On many systems, <b>g++</b> is also installed with the name <b>c++</b>.

       When you compile C++ programs, you may specify many of the same command-line options  that  you  use  for
       compiling  programs  in  any language; or command-line options meaningful for C and related languages; or
       options that are meaningful only for C++ programs.

   <b>Options</b> <b>Controlling</b> <b>C</b> <b>Dialect</b>
       The following options control the dialect of C (or languages derived from C, such as C++, Objective-C and
       Objective-C++) that the compiler accepts:

       <b>-ansi</b>
           In C mode, this is equivalent to <b>-std=c90</b>. In C++ mode, it is equivalent to <b>-std=c++98</b>.

           This turns off certain features of GCC that are incompatible with ISO C90 (when compiling C code), or
           of standard C++ (when compiling C++ code), such as the "asm" and "typeof"  keywords,  and  predefined
           macros  such as "unix" and "vax" that identify the type of system you are using.  It also enables the
           undesirable and rarely used ISO trigraph feature.  For the C compiler, it disables recognition of C++
           style <b>//</b> comments as well as the "inline" keyword.

           The alternate keywords "__asm__", "__extension__", "__inline__" and  "__typeof__"  continue  to  work
           despite  <b>-ansi</b>.   You  would not want to use them in an ISO C program, of course, but it is useful to
           put them in header files  that  might  be  included  in  compilations  done  with  <b>-ansi</b>.   Alternate
           predefined macros such as "__unix__" and "__vax__" are also available, with or without <b>-ansi</b>.

           The  <b>-ansi</b>  option does not cause non-ISO programs to be rejected gratuitously.  For that, <b>-Wpedantic</b>
           is required in addition to <b>-ansi</b>.

           The macro "__STRICT_ANSI__" is predefined when the <b>-ansi</b> option  is  used.   Some  header  files  may
           notice  this  macro  and refrain from declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that the
           ISO standard doesn't call for; this is to avoid interfering with any programs that  might  use  these
           names for other things.

           Functions that are normally built in but do not have semantics defined by ISO C (such as "alloca" and
           "ffs") are not built-in functions when <b>-ansi</b> is used.

       <b>-std=</b>
           Determine the language standard.   This option is currently only supported when compiling C or C++.

           The  compiler  can  accept  several  base  standards, such as <b>c90</b> or <b>c++98</b>, and GNU dialects of those
           standards, such as <b>gnu90</b> or <b>gnu++98</b>.  When a base standard is specified,  the  compiler  accepts  all
           programs  following  that  standard  plus  those using GNU extensions that do not contradict it.  For
           example, <b>-std=c90</b> turns off certain features of GCC that are incompatible with ISO C90, such  as  the
           "asm" and "typeof" keywords, but not other GNU extensions that do not have a meaning in ISO C90, such
           as omitting the middle term of a "?:" expression. On the other hand, when a GNU dialect of a standard
           is specified, all features supported by the compiler are enabled, even when those features change the
           meaning  of  the  base  standard.  As a result, some strict-conforming programs may be rejected.  The
           particular standard is used by <b>-Wpedantic</b> to identify which features are GNU  extensions  given  that
           version  of  the standard. For example <b>-std=gnu90</b> <b>-Wpedantic</b> warns about C++ style <b>//</b> comments, while
           <b>-std=gnu99</b> <b>-Wpedantic</b> does not.

           A value for this option must be provided; possible values are

       <b>-fgnu89-inline</b>
           The  option <b>-fgnu89-inline</b> tells GCC to use the traditional GNU semantics for "inline" functions when
           in C99 mode.

           Using this option is roughly equivalent to adding the "gnu_inline" function attribute to  all  inline
           functions.

           The  option  <b>-fno-gnu89-inline</b> explicitly tells GCC to use the C99 semantics for "inline" when in C99
           or gnu99 mode (i.e., it specifies the default behavior).  This option is not supported in <b>-std=c90</b> or
           <b>-std=gnu90</b> mode.

           The preprocessor macros "__GNUC_GNU_INLINE__" and "__GNUC_STDC_INLINE__" may be used to  check  which
           semantics are in effect for "inline" functions.

       <b>-fpermitted-flt-eval-methods=</b><u>style</u>
           ISO/IEC TS 18661-3 defines new permissible values for "FLT_EVAL_METHOD" that indicate that operations
           and  constants  with a semantic type that is an interchange or extended format should be evaluated to
           the precision and range of that type.  These new values are  a  superset  of  those  permitted  under
           C99/C11,  which does not specify the meaning of other positive values of "FLT_EVAL_METHOD".  As such,
           code conforming to C11 may not have been written expecting the possibility of the new values.

           <b>-fpermitted-flt-eval-methods</b>  specifies  whether  the  compiler  should  allow  only  the  values  of
           "FLT_EVAL_METHOD"  specified  in  C99/C11,  or  the  extended  set  of values specified in ISO/IEC TS
           18661-3.

           <u>style</u> is either "c11" or "ts-18661-3" as appropriate.

           The   default   when   in    a    standards    compliant    mode    (<b>-std=c11</b>    or    similar)    is
           <b>-fpermitted-flt-eval-methods=c11</b>.   The  default  when  in  a  GNU dialect (<b>-std=gnu11</b> or similar) is
           <b>-fpermitted-flt-eval-methods=ts-18661-3</b>.

       <b>-aux-info</b> <u>filename</u>
           Output to the given filename prototyped declarations for all functions declared and/or defined  in  a
           translation  unit,  including those in header files.  This option is silently ignored in any language
           other than C.

           Besides declarations, the file indicates, in comments, the origin of each  declaration  (source  file
           and  line),  whether  the declaration was implicit, prototyped or unprototyped (<b>I</b>, <b>N</b> for new or <b>O</b> for
           old, respectively, in the first character after the line number and the colon), and whether  it  came
           from  a  declaration or a definition (<b>C</b> or <b>F</b>, respectively, in the following character).  In the case
           of function definitions, a K&amp;R-style list  of  arguments  followed  by  their  declarations  is  also
           provided, inside comments, after the declaration.

       <b>-fallow-parameterless-variadic-functions</b>
           Accept variadic functions without named parameters.

           Although  it  is possible to define such a function, this is not very useful as it is not possible to
           read the arguments.  This is only supported for C as this construct is allowed by C++.

       <b>-fno-asm</b>
           Do not recognize "asm", "inline" or "typeof" as a keyword, so  that  code  can  use  these  words  as
           identifiers.   You  can  use  the  keywords  "__asm__", "__inline__" and "__typeof__" instead.  <b>-ansi</b>
           implies <b>-fno-asm</b>.

           In C++, this switch only affects  the  "typeof"  keyword,  since  "asm"  and  "inline"  are  standard
           keywords.  You may want to use the <b>-fno-gnu-keywords</b> flag instead, which has the same effect.  In C99
           mode  (<b>-std=c99</b>  or  <b>-std=gnu99</b>),  this  switch  only  affects the "asm" and "typeof" keywords, since
           "inline" is a standard keyword in ISO C99.

       <b>-fno-builtin</b>
       <b>-fno-builtin-</b><u>function</u>
           Don't recognize built-in functions that do not begin with <b>__builtin_</b> as prefix.

           GCC normally generates special code to  handle  certain  built-in  functions  more  efficiently;  for
           instance, calls to "alloca" may become single instructions which adjust the stack directly, and calls
           to  "memcpy"  may become inline copy loops.  The resulting code is often both smaller and faster, but
           since the function calls no longer appear as such, you cannot set a breakpoint on  those  calls,  nor
           can  you change the behavior of the functions by linking with a different library.  In addition, when
           a function is recognized as a built-in function, GCC may use information about that function to  warn
           about problems with calls to that function, or to generate more efficient code, even if the resulting
           code  still  contains  calls to that function.  For example, warnings are given with <b>-Wformat</b> for bad
           calls to "printf" when "printf" is built in and "strlen" is known not to modify global memory.

           With the <b>-fno-builtin-</b><u>function</u> option only the built-in function <u>function</u> is disabled.  <u>function</u> must
           not begin with <b>__builtin_</b>.  If a function is named that is not built-in in this version of GCC,  this
           option is ignored.  There is no corresponding <b>-fbuiltin-</b><u>function</u> option; if you wish to enable built-
           in functions selectively when using <b>-fno-builtin</b> or <b>-ffreestanding</b>, you may define macros such as:

                   #define abs(n)          __builtin_abs ((n))
                   #define strcpy(d, s)    __builtin_strcpy ((d), (s))

       <b>-fgimple</b>
           Enable  parsing of function definitions marked with "__GIMPLE".  This is an experimental feature that
           allows unit testing of GIMPLE passes.

       <b>-fhosted</b>
           Assert that compilation targets a hosted environment.  This implies <b>-fbuiltin</b>.  A hosted  environment
           is  one  in  which the entire standard library is available, and in which "main" has a return type of
           "int".  Examples are nearly everything except a kernel.  This is equivalent to <b>-fno-freestanding</b>.

       <b>-ffreestanding</b>
           Assert  that  compilation  targets  a  freestanding  environment.   This  implies  <b>-fno-builtin</b>.    A
           freestanding  environment is one in which the standard library may not exist, and program startup may
           not necessarily be at "main".  The most obvious example is an  OS  kernel.   This  is  equivalent  to
           <b>-fno-hosted</b>.

       <b>-fopenacc</b>
           Enable  handling of OpenACC directives "#pragma acc" in C/C++ and "!$acc" in Fortran.  When <b>-fopenacc</b>
           is  specified,  the  compiler  generates  accelerated  code  according  to  the  OpenACC  Application
           Programming Interface v2.6 &lt;<b>https://www.openacc.org</b>&gt;.  This option implies <b>-pthread</b>, and thus is only
           supported on targets that have support for <b>-pthread</b>.

       <b>-fopenacc-dim=</b><u>geom</u>
           Specify  default compute dimensions for parallel offload regions that do not explicitly specify.  The
           <u>geom</u> value is a triple of ':'-separated sizes, in order 'gang', 'worker' and, 'vector'.  A  size  can
           be omitted, to use a target-specific default value.

       <b>-fopenmp</b>
           Enable handling of OpenMP directives "#pragma omp" in C/C++ and "!$omp" in Fortran.  When <b>-fopenmp</b> is
           specified, the compiler generates parallel code according to the OpenMP Application Program Interface
           v4.5  &lt;<b>https://www.openmp.org</b>&gt;.   This option implies <b>-pthread</b>, and thus is only supported on targets
           that have support for <b>-pthread</b>. <b>-fopenmp</b> implies <b>-fopenmp-simd</b>.

       <b>-fopenmp-simd</b>
           Enable handling of OpenMP's SIMD directives with "#pragma omp" in C/C++ and "!$omp" in Fortran. Other
           OpenMP directives are ignored.

       <b>-fgnu-tm</b>
           When the option <b>-fgnu-tm</b> is specified, the compiler generates code for the Linux variant  of  Intel's
           current  Transactional  Memory  ABI  specification  document  (Revision 1.1, May 6 2009).  This is an
           experimental feature whose  interface  may  change  in  future  versions  of  GCC,  as  the  official
           specification changes.  Please note that not all architectures are supported for this feature.

           For more information on GCC's support for transactional memory,

           Note   that   the   transactional   memory   feature   is  not  supported  with  non-call  exceptions
           (<b>-fnon-call-exceptions</b>).

       <b>-fms-extensions</b>
           Accept some non-standard constructs used in Microsoft header files.

           In C++ code, this allows member names in structures to be similar to previous types declarations.

                   typedef int UOW;
                   struct ABC {
                     UOW UOW;
                   };

           Some cases of unnamed fields in structures and unions are only accepted with this option.

           Note that this option is off for all targets except for x86 targets using ms-abi.

       <b>-fplan9-extensions</b>
           Accept some non-standard constructs used in Plan 9 code.

           This enables <b>-fms-extensions</b>, permits  passing  pointers  to  structures  with  anonymous  fields  to
           functions  that  expect  pointers  to  elements  of  the  type of the field, and permits referring to
           anonymous fields declared using a typedef.    This is only supported for C, not C++.

       <b>-fcond-mismatch</b>
           Allow conditional expressions with mismatched types in the second and third arguments.  The value  of
           such an expression is void.  This option is not supported for C++.

       <b>-flax-vector-conversions</b>
           Allow  implicit  conversions  between  vectors with differing numbers of elements and/or incompatible
           element types.  This option should not be used for new code.

       <b>-funsigned-char</b>
           Let the type "char" be unsigned, like "unsigned char".

           Each kind of machine has a default for what "char" should be.  It is either like "unsigned  char"  by
           default or like "signed char" by default.

           Ideally, a portable program should always use "signed char" or "unsigned char" when it depends on the
           signedness of an object.  But many programs have been written to use plain "char" and expect it to be
           signed,  or  expect it to be unsigned, depending on the machines they were written for.  This option,
           and its inverse, let you make such a program work with the opposite default.

           The type "char" is always a distinct type from each of "signed char" or "unsigned char", even  though
           its behavior is always just like one of those two.

       <b>-fsigned-char</b>
           Let the type "char" be signed, like "signed char".

           Note  that  this  is equivalent to <b>-fno-unsigned-char</b>, which is the negative form of <b>-funsigned-char</b>.
           Likewise, the option <b>-fno-signed-char</b> is equivalent to <b>-funsigned-char</b>.

       <b>-fsigned-bitfields</b>
       <b>-funsigned-bitfields</b>
       <b>-fno-signed-bitfields</b>
       <b>-fno-unsigned-bitfields</b>
           These options control whether a bit-field is signed or unsigned, when the declaration  does  not  use
           either  "signed"  or "unsigned".  By default, such a bit-field is signed, because this is consistent:
           the basic integer types such as "int" are signed types.

       <b>-fsso-struct=</b><u>endianness</u>
           Set the default scalar storage order of structures and  unions  to  the  specified  endianness.   The
           accepted values are <b>big-endian</b>, <b>little-endian</b> and <b>native</b> for the native endianness of the target (the
           default).  This option is not supported for C++.

           <b>Warning:</b>  the <b>-fsso-struct</b> switch causes GCC to generate code that is not binary compatible with code
           generated without it if the specified endianness is not the native endianness of the target.

   <b>Options</b> <b>Controlling</b> <b>C++</b> <b>Dialect</b>
       This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful for C++ programs.  You can  also
       use  most  of  the GNU compiler options regardless of what language your program is in.  For example, you
       might compile a file <u>firstClass.C</u> like this:

               g++ -g -fstrict-enums -O -c firstClass.C

       In this example, only <b>-fstrict-enums</b> is an option meant only for C++ programs;  you  can  use  the  other
       options with any language supported by GCC.

       Some options for compiling C programs, such as <b>-std</b>, are also relevant for C++ programs.

       Here is a list of options that are <u>only</u> for compiling C++ programs:

       <b>-fabi-version=</b><u>n</u>
           Use version <u>n</u> of the C++ ABI.  The default is version 0.

           Version 0 refers to the version conforming most closely to the C++ ABI specification.  Therefore, the
           ABI obtained using version 0 will change in different versions of G++ as ABI bugs are fixed.

           Version 1 is the version of the C++ ABI that first appeared in G++ 3.2.

           Version  2  is the version of the C++ ABI that first appeared in G++ 3.4, and was the default through
           G++ 4.9.

           Version 3 corrects an error in mangling a constant address as a template argument.

           Version 4, which first appeared in G++ 4.5, implements a standard mangling for vector types.

           Version 5, which first appeared in G++ 4.6, corrects the  mangling  of  attribute  const/volatile  on
           function  pointer types, decltype of a plain decl, and use of a function parameter in the declaration
           of another parameter.

           Version 6, which first appeared in G++ 4.7, corrects the promotion behavior of C++11 scoped enums and
           the mangling of template argument packs, const/static_cast, prefix ++  and  --,  and  a  class  scope
           function used as a template argument.

           Version  7, which first appeared in G++ 4.8, that treats nullptr_t as a builtin type and corrects the
           mangling of lambdas in default argument scope.

           Version 8, which first appeared in G++ 4.9, corrects the substitution behavior of function types with
           function-cv-qualifiers.

           Version 9, which first appeared in G++ 5.2, corrects the alignment of "nullptr_t".

           Version 10, which first appeared in G++ 6.1, adds mangling of attributes that affect  type  identity,
           such as ia32 calling convention attributes (e.g. <b>stdcall</b>).

           Version  11,  which  first  appeared  in  G++  7,  corrects the mangling of sizeof... expressions and
           operator names.  For multiple entities with the same name within a function,  that  are  declared  in
           different  scopes,  the  mangling  now changes starting with the twelfth occurrence.  It also implies
           <b>-fnew-inheriting-ctors</b>.

           Version 12, which first appeared in G++ 8, corrects the calling conventions for empty classes on  the
           x86_64  target and for classes with only deleted copy/move constructors.  It accidentally changes the
           calling convention for classes with a deleted copy constructor and a trivial move constructor.

           Version 13, which first appeared in G++ 8.2, fixes the accidental change in version 12.

           Version 14, which first appeared in G++ 10, corrects the mangling of the nullptr expression.

           Version 15, which first appeared in G++ 11, changes the mangling of "__alignof__" to be distinct from
           that of "alignof", and dependent operator names.

           See also <b>-Wabi</b>.

       <b>-fabi-compat-version=</b><u>n</u>
           On targets that support strong aliases, G++ works around mangling changes by creating an  alias  with
           the  correct  mangled  name  when  defining  a  symbol  with  an incorrect mangled name.  This switch
           specifies which ABI version to use for the alias.

           With <b>-fabi-version=0</b> (the default), this defaults to  11  (GCC  7  compatibility).   If  another  ABI
           version  is explicitly selected, this defaults to 0.  For compatibility with GCC versions 3.2 through
           4.9, use <b>-fabi-compat-version=2</b>.

           If this option is not provided but <b>-Wabi=</b><u>n</u> is, that version is used for  compatibility  aliases.   If
           this  option is provided along with <b>-Wabi</b> (without the version), the version from this option is used
           for the warning.

       <b>-fno-access-control</b>
           Turn off all access checking.  This switch is mainly useful for working around  bugs  in  the  access
           control code.

       <b>-faligned-new</b>
           Enable  support  for  C++17  "new"  of  types  that  require  more  alignment  than "void* ::operator
           new(std::size_t)" provides.  A numeric argument such as "-faligned-new=32" can be used to specify how
           much alignment (in bytes) is provided by that function, but few  users  will  need  to  override  the
           default of alignof(std::max_align_t).

           This flag is enabled by default for <b>-std=c++17</b>.

       <b>-fchar8_t</b>
       <b>-fno-char8_t</b>
           Enable  support  for  "char8_t"  as adopted for C++20.  This includes the addition of a new "char8_t"
           fundamental type, changes to the types of UTF-8 string and character  literals,  new  signatures  for
           user-defined   literals,   associated   standard   library   updates,  and  new  "__cpp_char8_t"  and
           "__cpp_lib_char8_t" feature test macros.

           This option enables functions to be overloaded for ordinary and UTF-8 strings:

                   int f(const char *);    // #1
                   int f(const char8_t *); // #2
                   int v1 = f("text");     // Calls #1
                   int v2 = f(u8"text");   // Calls #2

           and introduces new signatures for user-defined literals:

                   int operator""_udl1(char8_t);
                   int v3 = u8'x'_udl1;
                   int operator""_udl2(const char8_t*, std::size_t);
                   int v4 = u8"text"_udl2;
                   template&lt;typename T, T...&gt; int operator""_udl3();
                   int v5 = u8"text"_udl3;

           The change to the types of UTF-8 string and character literals introduces incompatibilities with  ISO
           C++11  and  later  standards.  For example, the following code is well-formed under ISO C++11, but is
           ill-formed when <b>-fchar8_t</b> is specified.

                   char ca[] = u8"xx";     // error: char-array initialized from wide
                                           //        string
                   const char *cp = u8"xx";// error: invalid conversion from
                                           //        `const char8_t*' to `const char*'
                   int f(const char*);
                   auto v = f(u8"xx");     // error: invalid conversion from
                                           //        `const char8_t*' to `const char*'
                   std::string s{u8"xx"};  // error: no matching function for call to
                                           //        `std::basic_string&lt;char&gt;::basic_string()'
                   using namespace std::literals;
                   s = u8"xx"s;            // error: conversion from
                                           //        `basic_string&lt;char8_t&gt;' to non-scalar
                                           //        type `basic_string&lt;char&gt;' requested

       <b>-fcheck-new</b>
           Check that the pointer returned by "operator new" is non-null before attempting to modify the storage
           allocated.  This check is normally unnecessary because the C++ standard specifies that "operator new"
           only returns 0 if it is declared throw(), in which case the compiler always checks the  return  value
           even  without  this  option.   In  all  other  cases,  when  "operator new" has a non-empty exception
           specification, memory exhaustion is signalled by throwing "std::bad_alloc".  See also <b>new</b> <b>(nothrow)</b>.

       <b>-fconcepts</b>
       <b>-fconcepts-ts</b>
           Below  <b>-std=c++20</b>,  <b>-fconcepts</b>  enables  support  for  the  C++  Extensions  for  Concepts  Technical
           Specification, ISO 19217 (2015).

           With  <b>-std=c++20</b> and above, Concepts are part of the language standard, so <b>-fconcepts</b> defaults to on.
           But the standard specification of Concepts differs significantly from the TS, so some constructs that
           were allowed in the TS but didn't make it into the standard can still be enabled by <b>-fconcepts-ts</b>.

       <b>-fconstexpr-depth=</b><u>n</u>
           Set the maximum nested evaluation depth for C++11 constexpr functions to <u>n</u>.  A  limit  is  needed  to
           detect  endless  recursion  during  constant  expression  evaluation.   The  minimum specified by the
           standard is 512.

       <b>-fconstexpr-cache-depth=</b><u>n</u>
           Set the maximum level of nested evaluation depth for C++11 constexpr functions that will be cached to
           <u>n</u>.  This is  a  heuristic  that  trades  off  compilation  speed  (when  the  cache  avoids  repeated
           calculations)  against  memory  consumption  (when  the  cache grows very large from highly recursive
           evaluations).  The default is 8.  Very few users are likely to want to adjust it, but  if  your  code
           does  heavy  constexpr  calculations  you might want to experiment to find which value works best for
           you.

       <b>-fconstexpr-loop-limit=</b><u>n</u>
           Set the maximum number of iterations for a loop in C++14 constexpr functions to <u>n</u>.  A limit is needed
           to detect infinite loops during constant expression evaluation.  The default is 262144 (1&lt;&lt;18).

       <b>-fconstexpr-ops-limit=</b><u>n</u>
           Set the maximum number of operations during a single  constexpr  evaluation.   Even  when  number  of
           iterations  of  a  single loop is limited with the above limit, if there are several nested loops and
           each of them has many iterations but still smaller than the above limit, or if in a body of some loop
           or even outside of a loop too  many  expressions  need  to  be  evaluated,  the  resulting  constexpr
           evaluation might take too long.  The default is 33554432 (1&lt;&lt;25).

       <b>-fcoroutines</b>
           Enable support for the C++ coroutines extension (experimental).

       <b>-fno-elide-constructors</b>
           The  C++  standard  allows  an  implementation  to  omit  creating  a  temporary that is only used to
           initialize another object of the same type.  Specifying this option disables that  optimization,  and
           forces  G++  to  call the copy constructor in all cases.  This option also causes G++ to call trivial
           member functions which otherwise would be expanded inline.

           In C++17, the compiler is required to omit these temporaries, but this option still  affects  trivial
           member functions.

       <b>-fno-enforce-eh-specs</b>
           Don't  generate  code  to  check  for violation of exception specifications at run time.  This option
           violates the C++ standard, but may be useful for reducing code size in production builds,  much  like
           defining  "NDEBUG".   This does not give user code permission to throw exceptions in violation of the
           exception specifications; the compiler still optimizes based on the specifications,  so  throwing  an
           unexpected exception results in undefined behavior at run time.

       <b>-fextern-tls-init</b>
       <b>-fno-extern-tls-init</b>
           The  C++11  and  OpenMP  standards allow "thread_local" and "threadprivate" variables to have dynamic
           (runtime) initialization.  To support this, any use  of  such  a  variable  goes  through  a  wrapper
           function that performs any necessary initialization.  When the use and definition of the variable are
           in the same translation unit, this overhead can be optimized away, but when the use is in a different
           translation  unit  there  is  significant overhead even if the variable doesn't actually need dynamic
           initialization.  If the programmer can be sure that no use of the variable in a non-defining TU needs
           to trigger dynamic initialization (either because the variable is statically initialized, or a use of
           the variable in the defining TU will be executed before any uses in another TU), they can avoid  this
           overhead with the <b>-fno-extern-tls-init</b> option.

           On  targets  that  support  symbol aliases, the default is <b>-fextern-tls-init</b>.  On targets that do not
           support symbol aliases, the default is <b>-fno-extern-tls-init</b>.

       <b>-fno-gnu-keywords</b>
           Do not recognize "typeof" as a keyword, so that code can use this word as an identifier.  You can use
           the keyword "__typeof__" instead.  This option is implied by the  strict  ISO  C++  dialects:  <b>-ansi</b>,
           <b>-std=c++98</b>, <b>-std=c++11</b>, etc.

       <b>-fno-implicit-templates</b>
           Never  emit  code  for non-inline templates that are instantiated implicitly (i.e. by use); only emit
           code for explicit instantiations.  If you use this option, you must take care to structure your  code
           to include all the necessary explicit instantiations to avoid getting undefined symbols at link time.

       <b>-fno-implicit-inline-templates</b>
           Don't  emit  code  for implicit instantiations of inline templates, either.  The default is to handle
           inlines differently so that compiles with and without optimization need  the  same  set  of  explicit
           instantiations.

       <b>-fno-implement-inlines</b>
           To  save  space,  do  not  emit  out-of-line  copies  of  inline  functions  controlled  by  "#pragma
           implementation".  This causes linker errors if these functions are not inlined  everywhere  they  are
           called.

       <b>-fmodules-ts</b>
       <b>-fno-modules-ts</b>
           Enable support for C++20 modules   The <b>-fno-modules-ts</b> is usually not needed, as that is the default.
           Even  though  this  is  a  C++20  feature,  it  is not currently implicitly enabled by selecting that
           standard version.

       <b>-fmodule-header</b>
       <b>-fmodule-header=user</b>
       <b>-fmodule-header=system</b>
           Compile a header file to create an importable header unit.

       <b>-fmodule-implicit-inline</b>
           Member functions defined in their class definitions are not implicitly inline for modular code.  This
           is different to traditional C++ behavior, for good reasons.  However, it may result in  a  difficulty
           during code porting.  This option makes such function definitions implicitly inline.  It does however
           generate an ABI incompatibility, so you must use it everywhere or nowhere.  (Such definitions outside
           of a named module remain implicitly inline, regardless.)

       <b>-fno-module-lazy</b>
           Disable lazy module importing and module mapper creation.

       <b>-fmodule-mapper=</b>[<u>hostname</u>]<b>:</b><u>port</u>[<b>?</b><u>ident</u>]

       <b>-fmodule-mapper=</b><u>file</u>[<b>?</b><u>ident</u>]
           An  oracle  to  query  for  module  name  to filename mappings.  If unspecified the <b>CXX_MODULE_MAPPER</b>
           environment variable is used, and if that is unset, an in-process default is provided.

       <b>-fmodule-only</b>
           Only emit the Compiled Module Interface, inhibiting any object file.

       <b>-fms-extensions</b>
           Disable Wpedantic warnings about constructs used in MFC, such as implicit int and getting  a  pointer
           to member function via non-standard syntax.

       <b>-fnew-inheriting-ctors</b>
           Enable the P0136 adjustment to the semantics of C++11 constructor inheritance.  This is part of C++17
           but  also  considered to be a Defect Report against C++11 and C++14.  This flag is enabled by default
           unless <b>-fabi-version=10</b> or lower is specified.

       <b>-fnew-ttp-matching</b>
           Enable the P0522 resolution to Core issue 150, template template parameters  and  default  arguments:
           this  allows  a  template  with  default  template  arguments  as an argument for a template template
           parameter with fewer template parameters.  This flag is enabled by default for <b>-std=c++17</b>.

       <b>-fno-nonansi-builtins</b>
           Disable built-in declarations of functions that are not mandated by ANSI/ISO C.  These include "ffs",
           "alloca", "_exit", "index", "bzero", "conjf", and other related functions.

       <b>-fnothrow-opt</b>
           Treat a throw() exception specification as if  it  were  a  "noexcept"  specification  to  reduce  or
           eliminate  the  text  size  overhead  relative to a function with no exception specification.  If the
           function has local variables of types  with  non-trivial  destructors,  the  exception  specification
           actually  makes  the  function  smaller  because the EH cleanups for those variables can be optimized
           away.  The semantic effect is that an exception thrown out of  a  function  with  such  an  exception
           specification results in a call to "terminate" rather than "unexpected".

       <b>-fno-operator-names</b>
           Do  not  treat the operator name keywords "and", "bitand", "bitor", "compl", "not", "or" and "xor" as
           synonyms as keywords.

       <b>-fno-optional-diags</b>
           Disable diagnostics that the standard says a compiler does not need to issue.   Currently,  the  only
           such diagnostic issued by G++ is the one for a name having multiple meanings within a class.

       <b>-fpermissive</b>
           Downgrade   some  diagnostics  about  nonconformant  code  from  errors  to  warnings.   Thus,  using
           <b>-fpermissive</b> allows some nonconforming code to compile.

       <b>-fno-pretty-templates</b>
           When an error message refers to a specialization of a function template, the compiler normally prints
           the signature of the template followed by the template arguments and any typedefs or typenames in the
           signature (e.g. "void f(T) [with T = int]" rather than  "void  f(int)")  so  that  it's  clear  which
           template  is  involved.   When  an  error message refers to a specialization of a class template, the
           compiler omits any template arguments that match the default template arguments  for  that  template.
           If  either  of these behaviors make it harder to understand the error message rather than easier, you
           can use <b>-fno-pretty-templates</b> to disable them.

       <b>-fno-rtti</b>
           Disable generation of information about every class with virtual functions for use by  the  C++  run-
           time type identification features ("dynamic_cast" and "typeid").  If you don't use those parts of the
           language,  you  can  save  some space by using this flag.  Note that exception handling uses the same
           information, but G++ generates it as needed. The "dynamic_cast" operator can still be used for  casts
           that do not require run-time type information, i.e. casts to "void *" or to unambiguous base classes.

           Mixing  code  compiled  with  <b>-frtti</b>  with  that  compiled with <b>-fno-rtti</b> may not work.  For example,
           programs may fail to link if a class compiled with <b>-fno-rtti</b> is used as a base for a  class  compiled
           with <b>-frtti</b>.

       <b>-fsized-deallocation</b>
           Enable the built-in global declarations

                   void operator delete (void *, std::size_t) noexcept;
                   void operator delete[] (void *, std::size_t) noexcept;

           as introduced in C++14.  This is useful for user-defined replacement deallocation functions that, for
           example, use the size of the object to make deallocation faster.  Enabled by default under <b>-std=c++14</b>
           and above.  The flag <b>-Wsized-deallocation</b> warns about places that might want to add a definition.

       <b>-fstrict-enums</b>
           Allow  the  compiler to optimize using the assumption that a value of enumerated type can only be one
           of the values of the enumeration (as defined in the C++ standard; basically,  a  value  that  can  be
           represented  in the minimum number of bits needed to represent all the enumerators).  This assumption
           may not be valid if the program uses a cast to convert an arbitrary integer value to  the  enumerated
           type.

       <b>-fstrong-eval-order</b>
           Evaluate  member  access,  array  subscripting,  and  shift  expressions  in left-to-right order, and
           evaluate assignment  in  right-to-left  order,  as  adopted  for  C++17.   Enabled  by  default  with
           <b>-std=c++17</b>.    <b>-fstrong-eval-order=some</b>  enables  just  the  ordering  of  member  access  and  shift
           expressions, and is the default without <b>-std=c++17</b>.

       <b>-ftemplate-backtrace-limit=</b><u>n</u>
           Set the maximum number of template instantiation notes for a single  warning  or  error  to  <u>n</u>.   The
           default value is 10.

       <b>-ftemplate-depth=</b><u>n</u>
           Set the maximum instantiation depth for template classes to <u>n</u>.  A limit on the template instantiation
           depth  is  needed  to  detect  endless  recursions during template class instantiation.  ANSI/ISO C++
           conforming programs must not rely on a maximum depth greater than 17 (changed to 1024 in C++11).  The
           default value is 900, as the compiler can run  out  of  stack  space  before  hitting  1024  in  some
           situations.

       <b>-fno-threadsafe-statics</b>
           Do  not  emit  the  extra  code  to  use  the  routines  specified  in  the  C++  ABI for thread-safe
           initialization of local statics.  You can use this option to reduce code size slightly in  code  that
           doesn't need to be thread-safe.

       <b>-fuse-cxa-atexit</b>
           Register destructors for objects with static storage duration with the "__cxa_atexit" function rather
           than the "atexit" function.  This option is required for fully standards-compliant handling of static
           destructors, but only works if your C library supports "__cxa_atexit".

       <b>-fno-use-cxa-get-exception-ptr</b>
           Don't use the "__cxa_get_exception_ptr" runtime routine.  This causes "std::uncaught_exception" to be
           incorrect, but is necessary if the runtime routine is not available.

       <b>-fvisibility-inlines-hidden</b>
           This  switch  declares  that  the  user  does  not attempt to compare pointers to inline functions or
           methods where the addresses of the two functions are taken in different shared objects.

           The effect of this is that GCC may, effectively, mark inline methods with "__attribute__ ((visibility
           ("hidden")))" so that they do not appear in the export table of a  DSO  and  do  not  require  a  PLT
           indirection  when  used  within the DSO.  Enabling this option can have a dramatic effect on load and
           link times of a DSO as it massively reduces the size of the dynamic export  table  when  the  library
           makes heavy use of templates.

           The  behavior of this switch is not quite the same as marking the methods as hidden directly, because
           it does not affect static variables local to the function or cause the compiler to  deduce  that  the
           function is defined in only one shared object.

           You  may  mark a method as having a visibility explicitly to negate the effect of the switch for that
           method.  For example, if you do want to compare pointers to a particular  inline  method,  you  might
           mark  it  as  having default visibility.  Marking the enclosing class with explicit visibility has no
           effect.

           Explicitly instantiated inline methods are unaffected by this option as their linkage might otherwise
           cross a shared library boundary.

       <b>-fvisibility-ms-compat</b>
           This flag attempts to use visibility settings to make GCC's C++ linkage model compatible with that of
           Microsoft Visual Studio.

           The flag makes these changes to GCC's linkage model:

           1.  It sets the default visibility to "hidden", like <b>-fvisibility=hidden</b>.

           2.  Types, but not their members, are not hidden by default.

           3.  The One Definition Rule is relaxed for types without explicit visibility specifications that  are
               defined  in  more  than one shared object: those declarations are permitted if they are permitted
               when this option is not used.

           In new code it is better to use <b>-fvisibility=hidden</b> and export those classes that are intended to  be
           externally  visible.   Unfortunately  it  is  possible for code to rely, perhaps accidentally, on the
           Visual Studio behavior.

           Among the consequences of these changes are that static data members of the same type with  the  same
           name  but  defined  in  different  shared  objects are different, so changing one does not change the
           other; and that pointers to function members defined in different  shared  objects  may  not  compare
           equal.   When  this  flag  is  given, it is a violation of the ODR to define types with the same name
           differently.

       <b>-fno-weak</b>
           Do not use weak symbol support, even if it is provided by the linker.   By  default,  G++  uses  weak
           symbols  if  they are available.  This option exists only for testing, and should not be used by end-
           users; it results in inferior code and has no benefits.  This option  may  be  removed  in  a  future
           release of G++.

       <b>-fext-numeric-literals</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Accept  imaginary,  fixed-point,  or machine-defined literal number suffixes as GNU extensions.  When
           this option is turned off these suffixes are treated as C++11 user-defined literal numeric  suffixes.
           This  is  on  by  default  for all pre-C++11 dialects and all GNU dialects: <b>-std=c++98</b>, <b>-std=gnu++98</b>,
           <b>-std=gnu++11</b>, <b>-std=gnu++14</b>.  This option is off by default for ISO C++11 onwards (<b>-std=c++11</b>, ...).

       <b>-nostdinc++</b>
           Do not search for header files in the standard directories specific to C++, but do still  search  the
           other standard directories.  (This option is used when building the C++ library.)

       <b>-flang-info-include-translate</b>
       <b>-flang-info-include-translate-not</b>
       <b>-flang-info-include-translate=</b><u>header</u>
           Inform  of include translation events.  The first will note accepted include translations, the second
           will note declined include translations.   The  <u>header</u>  form  will  inform  of  include  translations
           relating  to that specific header.  If <u>header</u> is of the form "user" or "&lt;system&gt;" it will be resolved
           to a specific user or system header using the include path.

       <b>-flang-info-module-cmi</b>
       <b>-flang-info-module-cmi=</b><u>module</u>
           Inform of Compiled Module Interface pathnames.  The first will note  all  read  CMI  pathnames.   The
           <u>module</u>  form will not reading a specific module's CMI.  <u>module</u> may be a named module or a header-unit
           (the latter indicated by either being a pathname containing directory separators or enclosed in  "&lt;&gt;"
           or "").

       <b>-stdlib=</b><u>libstdc++,libc++</u>
           When  G++  is  configured  to  support  this option, it allows specification of alternate C++ runtime
           libraries.  Two options are available: <u>libstdc++</u> (the default, native C++ runtime for G++) and <u>libc++</u>
           which is the C++ runtime installed on some operating systems  (e.g.  Darwin  versions  from  Darwin11
           onwards).   The  option  switches  G++  to  use  the  headers  from the specified library and to emit
           "-lstdc++" or "-lc++" respectively, when a C++ runtime is required for linking.

       In addition, these warning options have meanings only for C++ programs:

       <b>-Wabi-tag</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn when a type with an ABI tag is used in a context that does not  have  that  ABI  tag.   See  <b>C++</b>
           <b>Attributes</b> for more information about ABI tags.

       <b>-Wcomma-subscript</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn about uses of a comma expression within a subscripting expression.  This usage was deprecated in
           C++20.  However, a comma expression wrapped in "( )" is not deprecated.  Example:

                   void f(int *a, int b, int c) {
                       a[b,c];     // deprecated
                       a[(b,c)];   // OK
                   }

           Enabled by default with <b>-std=c++20</b>.

       <b>-Wctad-maybe-unsupported</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn  when  performing  class template argument deduction (CTAD) on a type with no explicitly written
           deduction guides.  This warning will point out cases where CTAD succeeded only because  the  compiler
           synthesized  the implicit deduction guides, which might not be what the programmer intended.  Certain
           style guides allow CTAD only on types that specifically "opt-in"; i.e., on types that are designed to
           support CTAD.  This warning can be suppressed with the following pattern:

                   struct allow_ctad_t; // any name works
                   template &lt;typename T&gt; struct S {
                     S(T) { }
                   };
                   S(allow_ctad_t) -&gt; S&lt;void&gt;; // guide with incomplete parameter type will never be considered

       <b>-Wctor-dtor-privacy</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn when a class seems unusable because all the  constructors  or  destructors  in  that  class  are
           private,  and  it  has neither friends nor public static member functions.  Also warn if there are no
           non-private methods, and there's at least one private member function that  isn't  a  constructor  or
           destructor.

       <b>-Wdelete-non-virtual-dtor</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn  when  "delete"  is  used  to destroy an instance of a class that has virtual functions and non-
           virtual destructor. It is unsafe to delete an instance of a derived class through a pointer to a base
           class if the base class does not have a virtual destructor.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wdeprecated-copy</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn that the implicit declaration of a copy constructor or copy assignment operator is deprecated if
           the class has a user-provided copy constructor or copy assignment operator, in C++11  and  up.   This
           warning  is enabled by <b>-Wextra</b>.  With <b>-Wdeprecated-copy-dtor</b>, also deprecate if the class has a user-
           provided destructor.

       <b>-Wno-deprecated-enum-enum-conversion</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Disable the warning about the case when the usual arithmetic  conversions  are  applied  on  operands
           where  one  is of enumeration type and the other is of a different enumeration type.  This conversion
           was deprecated in C++20.  For example:

                   enum E1 { e };
                   enum E2 { f };
                   int k = f - e;

           <b>-Wdeprecated-enum-enum-conversion</b> is enabled by default with <b>-std=c++20</b>.  In pre-C++20 dialects, this
           warning can be enabled by <b>-Wenum-conversion</b>.

       <b>-Wno-deprecated-enum-float-conversion</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Disable the warning about the case when the usual arithmetic  conversions  are  applied  on  operands
           where  one  is  of  enumeration  type and the other is of a floating-point type.  This conversion was
           deprecated in C++20.  For example:

       <b>-Wno-init-list-lifetime</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Do  not  warn  about  uses of "std::initializer_list" that are likely to result in dangling pointers.
           Since the underlying array for an "initializer_list" is handled like a normal C++  temporary  object,
           it  is  easy  to inadvertently keep a pointer to the array past the end of the array's lifetime.  For
           example:

           *   If a function returns a temporary "initializer_list", or a local "initializer_list" variable, the
               array's lifetime ends at the end of the return statement, so the value returned  has  a  dangling
               pointer.

           *   If  a  new-expression  creates  an  "initializer_list", the array only lives until the end of the
               enclosing full-expression, so the "initializer_list" in the heap has a dangling pointer.

           *   When an "initializer_list" variable is assigned  from  a  brace-enclosed  initializer  list,  the
               temporary  array  created  for  the  right side of the assignment only lives until the end of the
               full-expression, so at the next statement the "initializer_list" variable has a dangling pointer.

                       // li's initial underlying array lives as long as li
                       std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt; li = { 1,2,3 };
                       // assignment changes li to point to a temporary array
                       li = { 4, 5 };
                       // now the temporary is gone and li has a dangling pointer
                       int i = li.begin()[0] // undefined behavior

           *   When a list constructor stores the "begin" pointer from  the  "initializer_list"  argument,  this
               doesn't  extend the lifetime of the array, so if a class variable is constructed from a temporary
               "initializer_list", the pointer  is  left  dangling  by  the  end  of  the  variable  declaration
               statement.

       <b>-Winvalid-imported-macros</b>
           Verify  all  imported  macro definitions are valid at the end of compilation.  This is not enabled by
           default, as it requires additional processing to determine.  It may be useful when preparing sets  of
           header-units to ensure consistent macros.

       <b>-Wno-literal-suffix</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Do  not  warn when a string or character literal is followed by a ud-suffix which does not begin with
           an underscore.  As a conforming extension, GCC treats such suffixes as separate preprocessing  tokens
           in   order   to  maintain  backwards  compatibility  with  code  that  uses  formatting  macros  from
           "&lt;inttypes.h&gt;".  For example:

                   #define __STDC_FORMAT_MACROS
                   #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/inttypes.h">inttypes.h</a>&gt;
                   #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdio.h">stdio.h</a>&gt;

                   int main() {
                     int64_t i64 = 123;
                     printf("My int64: %" PRId64"\n", i64);
                   }

           In this case, "PRId64" is treated as a separate preprocessing token.

           This option also controls warnings when a user-defined literal operator is declared  with  a  literal
           suffix  identifier that doesn't begin with an underscore. Literal suffix identifiers that don't begin
           with an underscore are reserved for future standardization.

           These warnings are enabled by default.

       <b>-Wno-narrowing</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           For C++11 and later standards, narrowing conversions are diagnosed by default,  as  required  by  the
           standard.   A narrowing conversion from a constant produces an error, and a narrowing conversion from
           a non-constant produces a warning, but <b>-Wno-narrowing</b> suppresses the diagnostic.  Note that this does
           not affect the meaning of well-formed code; narrowing conversions are still considered ill-formed  in
           SFINAE contexts.

           With  <b>-Wnarrowing</b>  in  C++98, warn when a narrowing conversion prohibited by C++11 occurs within <b>{</b> <b>}</b>,
           e.g.

                   int i = { 2.2 }; // error: narrowing from double to int

           This flag is included in <b>-Wall</b> and <b>-Wc++11-compat</b>.

       <b>-Wnoexcept</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn when a noexcept-expression evaluates to false because of a call to a function that does not have
           a non-throwing exception specification (i.e. throw() or "noexcept") but is known by the  compiler  to
           never throw an exception.

       <b>-Wnoexcept-type</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn  if  the  C++17  feature making "noexcept" part of a function type changes the mangled name of a
           symbol relative to C++14.  Enabled by <b>-Wabi</b> and <b>-Wc++17-compat</b>.

           As an example:

                   template &lt;class T&gt; void f(T t) { t(); };
                   void g() noexcept;
                   void h() { f(g); }

           In C++14, "f" calls "f&lt;void(*)()&gt;", but in C++17 it calls "f&lt;void(*)()noexcept&gt;".

       <b>-Wclass-memaccess</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn when the destination of a call to a raw memory function such  as  "memset"  or  "memcpy"  is  an
           object  of  class  type,  and  when writing into such an object might bypass the class non-trivial or
           deleted constructor or copy  assignment,  violate  const-correctness  or  encapsulation,  or  corrupt
           virtual  table  pointers.   Modifying  the  representation  of  such  objects  may violate invariants
           maintained by member functions of the class.  For example, the call to "memset"  below  is  undefined
           because  it modifies a non-trivial class object and is, therefore, diagnosed.  The safe way to either
           initialize or clear the storage of objects of such types is by using the appropriate  constructor  or
           assignment operator, if one is available.

                   std::string str = "abc";
                   memset (&amp;str, 0, sizeof str);

           The <b>-Wclass-memaccess</b> option is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.  Explicitly casting the pointer to the class object
           to  "void  *"  or  to  a  type  that can be safely accessed by the raw memory function suppresses the
           warning.

       <b>-Wnon-virtual-dtor</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn when a class has virtual functions and an accessible non-virtual  destructor  itself  or  in  an
           accessible polymorphic base class, in which case it is possible but unsafe to delete an instance of a
           derived  class  through  a  pointer to the class itself or base class.  This warning is automatically
           enabled if <b>-Weffc++</b> is specified.

       <b>-Wregister</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn on uses of the "register" storage class specifier, except when it is part of  the  GNU  <b>Explicit</b>
           <b>Register</b>  <b>Variables</b> extension.  The use of the "register" keyword as storage class specifier has been
           deprecated in C++11 and removed in C++17.  Enabled by default with <b>-std=c++17</b>.

       <b>-Wreorder</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn when the order of member initializers given in the code does not match the order in  which  they
           must be executed.  For instance:

                   struct A {
                     int i;
                     int j;
                     A(): j (0), i (1) { }
                   };

           The compiler rearranges the member initializers for "i" and "j" to match the declaration order of the
           members, emitting a warning to that effect.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wno-pessimizing-move</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           This  warning  warns  when a call to "std::move" prevents copy elision.  A typical scenario when copy
           elision can occur is when returning in a function with a class return type, when the expression being
           returned is the name of a non-volatile automatic object, and is not a function parameter, and has the
           same type as the function return type.

                   struct T {
                   ...
                   };
                   T fn()
                   {
                     T t;
                     ...
                     return std::move (t);
                   }

           But in this example, the "std::move" call prevents copy elision.

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wno-redundant-move</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           This warning warns about redundant calls to "std::move"; that is, when a move  operation  would  have
           been  performed  even  without  the "std::move" call.  This happens because the compiler is forced to
           treat the object as if it were an rvalue in certain situations such as returning  a  local  variable,
           where copy elision isn't applicable.  Consider:

                   struct T {
                   ...
                   };
                   T fn(T t)
                   {
                     ...
                     return std::move (t);
                   }

           Here, the "std::move" call is redundant.  Because G++ implements Core Issue 1579, another example is:

                   struct T { // convertible to U
                   ...
                   };
                   struct U {
                   ...
                   };
                   U fn()
                   {
                     T t;
                     ...
                     return std::move (t);
                   }

           In  this example, copy elision isn't applicable because the type of the expression being returned and
           the function return type differ, yet G++ treats the return value as  if  it  were  designated  by  an
           rvalue.

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-Wrange-loop-construct</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           This  warning warns when a C++ range-based for-loop is creating an unnecessary copy.  This can happen
           when the range declaration is not a reference, but probably should be.  For example:

                   struct S { char arr[128]; };
                   void fn () {
                     S arr[5];
                     for (const auto x : arr) { ... }
                   }

           It does not warn when the type being copied is a trivially-copyable type whose size is less  than  64
           bytes.

           This warning also warns when a loop variable in a range-based for-loop is initialized with a value of
           a different type resulting in a copy.  For example:

                   void fn() {
                     int arr[10];
                     for (const double &amp;x : arr) { ... }
                   }

           In  the  example  above, in every iteration of the loop a temporary value of type "double" is created
           and destroyed, to which the reference "const double &amp;" is bound.

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wredundant-tags</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn about redundant class-key and enum-key in references to class  types  and  enumerated  types  in
           contexts where the key can be eliminated without causing an ambiguity.  For example:

                   struct foo;
                   struct foo *p;   // warn that keyword struct can be eliminated

           On the other hand, in this example there is no warning:

                   struct foo;
                   void foo ();   // "hides" struct foo
                   void bar (struct foo&amp;);  // no warning, keyword struct is necessary

       <b>-Wno-subobject-linkage</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Do  not warn if a class type has a base or a field whose type uses the anonymous namespace or depends
           on a type with no linkage.  If a type A depends on a type B with no or internal linkage, defining  it
           in multiple translation units would be an ODR violation because the meaning of B is different in each
           translation  unit.   If  A  only  appears  in  a single translation unit, the best way to silence the
           warning is to give it internal linkage by putting it in an anonymous namespace as well.  The compiler
           doesn't give this warning for types defined in the main .C  file,  as  those  are  unlikely  to  have
           multiple definitions.  <b>-Wsubobject-linkage</b> is enabled by default.

       <b>-Weffc++</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn  about  violations  of the following style guidelines from Scott Meyers' <u>Effective</u> <u>C++</u> series of
           books:

           *   Define a copy constructor and an  assignment  operator  for  classes  with  dynamically-allocated
               memory.

           *   Prefer initialization to assignment in constructors.

           *   Have "operator=" return a reference to *this.

           *   Don't try to return a reference when you must return an object.

           *   Distinguish between prefix and postfix forms of increment and decrement operators.

           *   Never overload "&amp;&amp;", "||", or ",".

           This  option also enables <b>-Wnon-virtual-dtor</b>, which is also one of the effective C++ recommendations.
           However, the check is extended to warn about the  lack  of  virtual  destructor  in  accessible  non-
           polymorphic bases classes too.

           When  selecting  this  option,  be  aware  that the standard library headers do not obey all of these
           guidelines; use <b>grep</b> <b>-v</b> to filter out those warnings.

       <b>-Wno-exceptions</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Disable the warning about the case when an exception handler is shadowed by  another  handler,  which
           can point out a wrong ordering of exception handlers.

       <b>-Wstrict-null-sentinel</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn  about  the use of an uncasted "NULL" as sentinel.  When compiling only with GCC this is a valid
           sentinel, as "NULL" is defined to "__null".  Although it is a null pointer  constant  rather  than  a
           null  pointer,  it  is  guaranteed to be of the same size as a pointer.  But this use is not portable
           across different compilers.

       <b>-Wno-non-template-friend</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Disable warnings when non-template friend functions are declared within  a  template.   In  very  old
           versions  of  GCC  that  predate  implementation of the ISO standard, declarations such as <b>friend</b> <b>int</b>
           <b>foo(int)</b>, where the name of the friend is an unqualified-id, could be  interpreted  as  a  particular
           specialization  of a template function; the warning exists to diagnose compatibility problems, and is
           enabled by default.

       <b>-Wold-style-cast</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn if an old-style (C-style) cast to a non-void type is used within a C++ program.   The  new-style
           casts  ("dynamic_cast",  "static_cast",  "reinterpret_cast", and "const_cast") are less vulnerable to
           unintended effects and much easier to search for.

       <b>-Woverloaded-virtual</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn when a function declaration hides virtual functions from a base class.  For example, in:

                   struct A {
                     virtual void f();
                   };

                   struct B: public A {
                     void f(int);
                   };

           the "A" class version of "f" is hidden in "B", and code like:

                   B* b;
                   b-&gt;f();

           fails to compile.

       <b>-Wno-pmf-conversions</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Disable the diagnostic for converting a bound pointer to member function to a plain pointer.

       <b>-Wsign-promo</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn when overload resolution chooses a promotion from unsigned or enumerated type to a signed  type,
           over  a  conversion to an unsigned type of the same size.  Previous versions of G++ tried to preserve
           unsignedness, but the standard mandates the current behavior.

       <b>-Wtemplates</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn when a primary template declaration is encountered.  Some coding rules disallow  templates,  and
           this  may be used to enforce that rule.  The warning is inactive inside a system header file, such as
           the STL, so one can still use the STL.  One may also instantiate or specialize templates.

       <b>-Wno-mismatched-new-delete</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn for mismatches between calls to "operator new" or "operator delete" and the  corresponding  call
           to  the allocation or deallocation function.  This includes invocations of C++ "operator delete" with
           pointers returned from either mismatched forms of  "operator  new",  or  from  other  functions  that
           allocate  objects  for  which the "operator delete" isn't a suitable deallocator, as well as calls to
           other deallocation functions with pointers returned from "operator new" for  which  the  deallocation
           function isn't suitable.

           For  example, the "delete" expression in the function below is diagnosed because it doesn't match the
           array form of the "new" expression the pointer argument was returned from.  Similarly,  the  call  to
           "free" is also diagnosed.

                   void f ()
                   {
                     int *a = new int[n];
                     delete a;   // warning: mismatch in array forms of expressions

                     char *p = new char[n];
                     free (p);   // warning: mismatch between new and free
                   }

           The  related  option  <b>-Wmismatched-dealloc</b> diagnoses mismatches involving allocation and deallocation
           functions other than "operator new" and "operator delete".

           <b>-Wmismatched-new-delete</b> is enabled by default.

       <b>-Wmismatched-tags</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn for declarations of structs, classes, and class  templates  and  their  specializations  with  a
           class-key  that  does  not  match  either the definition or the first declaration if no definition is
           provided.

           For example, the declaration of "struct Object" in the argument list of "draw" triggers the  warning.
           To  avoid  it, either remove the redundant class-key "struct" or replace it with "class" to match its
           definition.

                   class Object {
                   public:
                     virtual ~Object () = 0;
                   };
                   void draw (struct Object*);

           It is not wrong to declare a class with the class-key "struct"  as  the  example  above  shows.   The
           <b>-Wmismatched-tags</b>  option  is  intended to help achieve a consistent style of class declarations.  In
           code that is intended to be portable to Windows-based compilers the warning helps prevent  unresolved
           references  due to the difference in the mangling of symbols declared with different class-keys.  The
           option can be used either on its own or in conjunction with <b>-Wredundant-tags</b>.

       <b>-Wmultiple-inheritance</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn when a class is defined with multiple direct base classes.  Some coding rules disallow  multiple
           inheritance,  and  this  may  be  used to enforce that rule.  The warning is inactive inside a system
           header file, such as the STL, so one can still use  the  STL.   One  may  also  define  classes  that
           indirectly use multiple inheritance.

       <b>-Wvirtual-inheritance</b>
           Warn  when  a class is defined with a virtual direct base class.  Some coding rules disallow multiple
           inheritance, and this may be used to enforce that rule.  The warning  is  inactive  inside  a  system
           header  file,  such  as  the  STL,  so  one  can still use the STL.  One may also define classes that
           indirectly use virtual inheritance.

       <b>-Wno-virtual-move-assign</b>
           Suppress warnings about inheriting from a virtual base  with  a  non-trivial  C++11  move  assignment
           operator.  This is dangerous because if the virtual base is reachable along more than one path, it is
           moved  multiple  times,  which  can  mean  both  objects end up in the moved-from state.  If the move
           assignment operator is written to avoid  moving  from  a  moved-from  object,  this  warning  can  be
           disabled.

       <b>-Wnamespaces</b>
           Warn  when  a namespace definition is opened.  Some coding rules disallow namespaces, and this may be
           used to enforce that rule.  The warning is inactive inside a system header file, such as the STL,  so
           one can still use the STL.  One may also use using directives and qualified names.

       <b>-Wno-terminate</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Disable the warning about a throw-expression that will immediately result in a call to "terminate".

       <b>-Wno-vexing-parse</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn  about the most vexing parse syntactic ambiguity.  This warns about the cases when a declaration
           looks like a variable definition, but the C++ language requires it to be interpreted  as  a  function
           declaration.  For instance:

                   void f(double a) {
                     int i();        // extern int i (void);
                     int n(int(a));  // extern int n (int);
                   }

           Another example:

                   struct S { S(int); };
                   void f(double a) {
                     S x(int(a));   // extern struct S x (int);
                     S y(int());    // extern struct S y (int (*) (void));
                     S z();         // extern struct S z (void);
                   }

           The  warning  will  suggest options how to deal with such an ambiguity; e.g., it can suggest removing
           the parentheses or using braces instead.

           This warning is enabled by default.

       <b>-Wno-class-conversion</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Do not warn when a conversion function converts an object to the same type, to a base class  of  that
           type, or to void; such a conversion function will never be called.

       <b>-Wvolatile</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn  about  deprecated  uses of the "volatile" qualifier.  This includes postfix and prefix "++" and
           "--" expressions of "volatile"-qualified types, using simple assignments where the left operand is  a
           "volatile"-qualified non-class type for their value, compound assignments where the left operand is a
           "volatile"-qualified  non-class type, "volatile"-qualified function return type, "volatile"-qualified
           parameter type, and structured bindings of a "volatile"-qualified type.  This usage was deprecated in
           C++20.

           Enabled by default with <b>-std=c++20</b>.

       <b>-Wzero-as-null-pointer-constant</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn when a literal <b>0</b> is used as null pointer  constant.   This  can  be  useful  to  facilitate  the
           conversion to "nullptr" in C++11.

       <b>-Waligned-new</b>
           Warn   about   a   new-expression   of   a   type   that   requires   greater   alignment   than  the
           alignof(std::max_align_t) but uses an allocation function without an  explicit  alignment  parameter.
           This option is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

           Normally  this  only  warns about global allocation functions, but <b>-Waligned-new=all</b> also warns about
           class member allocation functions.

       <b>-Wno-placement-new</b>
       <b>-Wplacement-new=</b><u>n</u>
           Warn about placement new expressions with undefined behavior, such as constructing  an  object  in  a
           buffer  that is smaller than the type of the object.  For example, the placement new expression below
           is diagnosed because it attempts to construct an array of 64 integers  in  a  buffer  only  64  bytes
           large.

                   char buf [64];
                   new (buf) int[64];

           This warning is enabled by default.

           <b>-Wplacement-new=1</b>
               This  is  the  default warning level of <b>-Wplacement-new</b>.  At this level the warning is not issued
               for some strictly undefined constructs that GCC  allows  as  extensions  for  compatibility  with
               legacy  code.   For  example,  the following "new" expression is not diagnosed at this level even
               though it has undefined behavior according to the C++ standard because it writes past the end  of
               the one-element array.

                       struct S { int n, a[1]; };
                       S *s = (S *)malloc (sizeof *s + 31 * sizeof s-&gt;a[0]);
                       new (s-&gt;a)int [32]();

           <b>-Wplacement-new=2</b>
               At  this  level, in addition to diagnosing all the same constructs as at level 1, a diagnostic is
               also issued for placement new expressions  that  construct  an  object  in  the  last  member  of
               structure  whose type is an array of a single element and whose size is less than the size of the
               object being constructed.  While the previous example would be diagnosed, the following construct
               makes use of the flexible member array extension to avoid the warning at level 2.

                       struct S { int n, a[]; };
                       S *s = (S *)malloc (sizeof *s + 32 * sizeof s-&gt;a[0]);
                       new (s-&gt;a)int [32]();

       <b>-Wcatch-value</b>
       <b>-Wcatch-value=</b><u>n</u> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn about catch handlers that do not catch via reference.  With  <b>-Wcatch-value=1</b>  (or  <b>-Wcatch-value</b>
           for  short)  warn  about polymorphic class types that are caught by value.  With <b>-Wcatch-value=2</b> warn
           about all class types that are caught by value. With <b>-Wcatch-value=3</b> warn about all  types  that  are
           not caught by reference. <b>-Wcatch-value</b> is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wconditionally-supported</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn for conditionally-supported (C++11 [intro.defs]) constructs.

       <b>-Wno-delete-incomplete</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Do  not  warn  when  deleting  a  pointer  to  incomplete type, which may cause undefined behavior at
           runtime.  This warning is enabled by default.

       <b>-Wextra-semi</b> (C++, Objective-C++ only)
           Warn about redundant semicolons after in-class function definitions.

       <b>-Wno-inaccessible-base</b> (C++, Objective-C++ only)
           This option controls warnings when a base class is inaccessible in a class derived  from  it  due  to
           ambiguity.   The warning is enabled by default.  Note that the warning for ambiguous virtual bases is
           enabled by the <b>-Wextra</b> option.

                   struct A { int a; };

                   struct B : A { };

                   struct C : B, A { };

       <b>-Wno-inherited-variadic-ctor</b>
           Suppress warnings about use of C++11 inheriting constructors when the base class inherited from has a
           C variadic constructor; the warning is on by default because the ellipsis is not inherited.

       <b>-Wno-invalid-offsetof</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Suppress warnings from applying the "offsetof" macro to a non-POD type.  According to  the  2014  ISO
           C++  standard,  applying  "offsetof"  to  a  non-standard-layout  type is undefined.  In existing C++
           implementations, however, "offsetof" typically gives meaningful results.  This flag is for users  who
           are  aware  that  they  are  writing  nonportable code and who have deliberately chosen to ignore the
           warning about it.

           The restrictions on "offsetof" may be relaxed in a future version of the C++ standard.

       <b>-Wsized-deallocation</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn about a definition of an unsized deallocation function

                   void operator delete (void *) noexcept;
                   void operator delete[] (void *) noexcept;

           without a definition of the corresponding sized deallocation function

                   void operator delete (void *, std::size_t) noexcept;
                   void operator delete[] (void *, std::size_t) noexcept;

           or vice versa.  Enabled by <b>-Wextra</b> along with <b>-fsized-deallocation</b>.

       <b>-Wsuggest-final-types</b>
           Warn about types with virtual methods where code quality would be improved if the type were  declared
           with  the  C++11  "final" specifier, or, if possible, declared in an anonymous namespace. This allows
           GCC to more aggressively devirtualize the polymorphic calls. This  warning  is  more  effective  with
           link-time optimization, where the information about the class hierarchy graph is more complete.

       <b>-Wsuggest-final-methods</b>
           Warn  about virtual methods where code quality would be improved if the method were declared with the
           C++11 "final" specifier, or, if possible, its type were declared in an anonymous  namespace  or  with
           the  "final"  specifier.   This  warning  is  more  effective  with link-time optimization, where the
           information about the class hierarchy graph is more complete. It is  recommended  to  first  consider
           suggestions of <b>-Wsuggest-final-types</b> and then rebuild with new annotations.

       <b>-Wsuggest-override</b>
           Warn about overriding virtual functions that are not marked with the "override" keyword.

       <b>-Wuseless-cast</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn when an expression is casted to its own type.

       <b>-Wno-conversion-null</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Do  not  warn  for  conversions between "NULL" and non-pointer types. <b>-Wconversion-null</b> is enabled by
           default.

   <b>Options</b> <b>Controlling</b> <b>Objective-C</b> <b>and</b> <b>Objective-C++</b> <b>Dialects</b>
       (NOTE: This manual does not describe the Objective-C and Objective-C++ languages themselves.

       This  section  describes  the  command-line  options  that  are  only  meaningful  for  Objective-C   and
       Objective-C++  programs.   You  can  also use most of the language-independent GNU compiler options.  For
       example, you might compile a file <u>some_class.m</u> like this:

               gcc -g -fgnu-runtime -O -c some_class.m

       In this example, <b>-fgnu-runtime</b> is an option meant only for Objective-C and  Objective-C++  programs;  you
       can use the other options with any language supported by GCC.

       Note  that  since  Objective-C  is  an extension of the C language, Objective-C compilations may also use
       options specific to the C front-end (e.g., <b>-Wtraditional</b>).  Similarly, Objective-C++ compilations may use
       C++-specific options (e.g., <b>-Wabi</b>).

       Here is a list of options that are <u>only</u> for compiling Objective-C and Objective-C++ programs:

       <b>-fconstant-string-class=</b><u>class-name</u>
           Use <u>class-name</u> as the name of the class to instantiate for each literal  string  specified  with  the
           syntax  "@"..."".  The default class name is "NXConstantString" if the GNU runtime is being used, and
           "NSConstantString" if the NeXT runtime is being  used  (see  below).   On  Darwin  (macOS,  MacOS  X)
           platforms,  the  <b>-fconstant-cfstrings</b>  option, if also present, overrides the <b>-fconstant-string-class</b>
           setting and cause "@"..."" literals to be laid out as constant  CoreFoundation  strings.   Note  that
           <b>-fconstant-cfstrings</b> is an alias for the target-specific <b>-mconstant-cfstrings</b> equivalent.

       <b>-fgnu-runtime</b>
           Generate  object  code compatible with the standard GNU Objective-C runtime.  This is the default for
           most types of systems.

       <b>-fnext-runtime</b>
           Generate output compatible with the NeXT runtime.   This  is  the  default  for  NeXT-based  systems,
           including  Darwin  and  Mac  OS  X.  The macro "__NEXT_RUNTIME__" is predefined if (and only if) this
           option is used.

       <b>-fno-nil-receivers</b>
           Assume that all Objective-C message dispatches ("[receiver message:arg]") in  this  translation  unit
           ensure that the receiver is not "nil".  This allows for more efficient entry points in the runtime to
           be used.  This option is only available in conjunction with the NeXT runtime and ABI version 0 or 1.

       <b>-fobjc-abi-version=</b><u>n</u>
           Use  version  <u>n</u>  of the Objective-C ABI for the selected runtime.  This option is currently supported
           only for the NeXT runtime.  In that case, Version 0 is the traditional (32-bit) ABI  without  support
           for  properties  and other Objective-C 2.0 additions.  Version 1 is the traditional (32-bit) ABI with
           support for properties and other Objective-C 2.0 additions.  Version 2 is the  modern  (64-bit)  ABI.
           If  nothing is specified, the default is Version 0 on 32-bit target machines, and Version 2 on 64-bit
           target machines.

       <b>-fobjc-call-cxx-cdtors</b>
           For each Objective-C class, check if any of its instance variables is a C++ object with a non-trivial
           default constructor.  If so, synthesize a special "- (id) .cxx_construct" instance method which  runs
           non-trivial  default  constructors  on any such instance variables, in order, and then return "self".
           Similarly, check if any instance variable is a C++ object with a non-trivial destructor, and  if  so,
           synthesize  a  special  "-  (void)  .cxx_destruct" method which runs all such default destructors, in
           reverse order.

           The "- (id) .cxx_construct" and "- (void) .cxx_destruct" methods thusly  generated  only  operate  on
           instance  variables  declared  in  the  current  Objective-C  class,  and  not  those  inherited from
           superclasses.  It is the responsibility of the Objective-C runtime to invoke all such methods  in  an
           object's  inheritance  hierarchy.   The  "-  (id)  .cxx_construct" methods are invoked by the runtime
           immediately after a new object instance is  allocated;  the  "-  (void)  .cxx_destruct"  methods  are
           invoked immediately before the runtime deallocates an object instance.

           As  of this writing, only the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.4 and later has support for invoking the "-
           (id) .cxx_construct" and "- (void) .cxx_destruct" methods.

       <b>-fobjc-direct-dispatch</b>
           Allow fast jumps to the message dispatcher.  On Darwin this is accomplished via the comm page.

       <b>-fobjc-exceptions</b>
           Enable syntactic support for structured exception handling in Objective-C, similar to what is offered
           by C++.  This option is required to use the Objective-C keywords @try, @throw, @catch,  @finally  and
           @synchronized.   This  option  is  available  with both the GNU runtime and the NeXT runtime (but not
           available in conjunction with the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.2 and earlier).

       <b>-fobjc-gc</b>
           Enable garbage collection (GC) in Objective-C  and  Objective-C++  programs.   This  option  is  only
           available  with  the  NeXT runtime; the GNU runtime has a different garbage collection implementation
           that does not require special compiler flags.

       <b>-fobjc-nilcheck</b>
           For the NeXT runtime with version 2 of the ABI, check for a nil receiver in method invocations before
           doing the actual method call.  This is the default and  can  be  disabled  using  <b>-fno-objc-nilcheck</b>.
           Class  methods  and super calls are never checked for nil in this way no matter what this flag is set
           to.  Currently this flag does nothing when the GNU runtime, or an older version of the  NeXT  runtime
           ABI, is used.

       <b>-fobjc-std=objc1</b>
           Conform  to  the  language  syntax of Objective-C 1.0, the language recognized by GCC 4.0.  This only
           affects the Objective-C additions to the C/C++ language; it does  not  affect  conformance  to  C/C++
           standards,  which is controlled by the separate C/C++ dialect option flags.  When this option is used
           with the Objective-C or Objective-C++ compiler, any Objective-C syntax that is not recognized by  GCC
           4.0  is rejected.  This is useful if you need to make sure that your Objective-C code can be compiled
           with older versions of GCC.

       <b>-freplace-objc-classes</b>
           Emit a special marker instructing <b><a href="../man1/ld.1.html">ld</a>(1)</b> not to statically link in  the  resulting  object  file,  and
           allow  <b><a href="../man1/dyld.1.html">dyld</a>(1)</b>  to  load  it  in  at run time instead.  This is used in conjunction with the Fix-and-
           Continue debugging mode, where the object file in question may be recompiled and dynamically reloaded
           in the course of program execution, without the need to restart the program itself.  Currently,  Fix-
           and-Continue  functionality  is  only available in conjunction with the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.3
           and later.

       <b>-fzero-link</b>
           When compiling for the NeXT runtime, the compiler ordinarily replaces calls  to  objc_getClass("...")
           (when  the  name  of  the  class  is  known  at  compile  time) with static class references that get
           initialized at load time, which improves  run-time  performance.   Specifying  the  <b>-fzero-link</b>  flag
           suppresses this behavior and causes calls to objc_getClass("...")  to be retained.  This is useful in
           Zero-Link  debugging mode, since it allows for individual class implementations to be modified during
           program  execution.   The  GNU  runtime  currently  always  retains  calls  to  objc_get_class("...")
           regardless of command-line options.

       <b>-fno-local-ivars</b>
           By  default  instance  variables  in Objective-C can be accessed as if they were local variables from
           within the methods of the class they're declared in.  This can lead  to  shadowing  between  instance
           variables and other variables declared either locally inside a class method or globally with the same
           name.   Specifying  the <b>-fno-local-ivars</b> flag disables this behavior thus avoiding variable shadowing
           issues.

       <b>-fivar-visibility=</b>[<b>public</b>|<b>protected</b>|<b>private</b>|<b>package</b>]
           Set the default instance variable visibility to the  specified  option  so  that  instance  variables
           declared outside the scope of any access modifier directives default to the specified visibility.

       <b>-gen-decls</b>
           Dump interface declarations for all classes seen in the source file to a file named <u>sourcename.decl</u>.

       <b>-Wassign-intercept</b> (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn whenever an Objective-C assignment is being intercepted by the garbage collector.

       <b>-Wno-property-assign-default</b> (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)
           Do not warn if a property for an Objective-C object has no assign semantics specified.

       <b>-Wno-protocol</b> (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)
           If  a class is declared to implement a protocol, a warning is issued for every method in the protocol
           that is not implemented by the class.  The default behavior is to issue a warning  for  every  method
           not  explicitly  implemented  in  the  class,  even  if a method implementation is inherited from the
           superclass.  If you use the <b>-Wno-protocol</b> option, then methods  inherited  from  the  superclass  are
           considered to be implemented, and no warning is issued for them.

       <b>-Wobjc-root-class</b> (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn if a class interface lacks a superclass. Most classes will inherit from "NSObject" (or "Object")
           for  example.   When  declaring classes intended to be root classes, the warning can be suppressed by
           marking their interfaces with "__attribute__((objc_root_class))".

       <b>-Wselector</b> (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn if multiple methods of different types for the same selector are found during compilation.   The
           check  is  performed on the list of methods in the final stage of compilation.  Additionally, a check
           is performed for each selector appearing in a @selector(...)  expression, and a corresponding  method
           for that selector has been found during compilation.  Because these checks scan the method table only
           at  the  end of compilation, these warnings are not produced if the final stage of compilation is not
           reached, for example because an error is found  during  compilation,  or  because  the  <b>-fsyntax-only</b>
           option is being used.

       <b>-Wstrict-selector-match</b> (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn  if  multiple methods with differing argument and/or return types are found for a given selector
           when attempting to send a message using this selector to a receiver of type "id"  or  "Class".   When
           this flag is off (which is the default behavior), the compiler omits such warnings if any differences
           found are confined to types that share the same size and alignment.

       <b>-Wundeclared-selector</b> (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn  if  a  @selector(...)  expression  referring to an undeclared selector is found.  A selector is
           considered undeclared if no method with  that  name  has  been  declared  before  the  @selector(...)
           expression,  either  explicitly  in  an  @interface  or  @protocol  declaration,  or implicitly in an
           @implementation section.  This option  always  performs  its  checks  as  soon  as  a  @selector(...)
           expression  is  found,  while  <b>-Wselector</b> only performs its checks in the final stage of compilation.
           This also enforces the coding style convention that methods and selectors  must  be  declared  before
           being used.

       <b>-print-objc-runtime-info</b>
           Generate C header describing the largest structure that is passed by value, if any.

   <b>Options</b> <b>to</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>Messages</b> <b>Formatting</b>
       Traditionally,  diagnostic  messages have been formatted irrespective of the output device's aspect (e.g.
       its width, ...).  You can use the options  described  below  to  control  the  formatting  algorithm  for
       diagnostic  messages,  e.g. how many characters per line, how often source location information should be
       reported.  Note that some language front ends may not honor these options.

       <b>-fmessage-length=</b><u>n</u>
           Try to format error messages so that they fit on lines of about <u>n</u> characters.  If <u>n</u> is zero, then  no
           line-wrapping  is  done;  each  error  message appears on a single line.  This is the default for all
           front ends.

           Note - this option also affects the display of the <b>#error</b> and <b>#warning</b> pre-processor directives,  and
           the  <b>deprecated</b>  function/type/variable attribute.  It does not however affect the <b>pragma</b> <b>GCC</b> <b>warning</b>
           and <b>pragma</b> <b>GCC</b> <b>error</b> pragmas.

       <b>-fdiagnostics-plain-output</b>
           This option requests that diagnostic output look as plain as  possible,  which  may  be  useful  when
           running  <b>dejagnu</b>  or  other utilities that need to parse diagnostics output and prefer that it remain
           more stable over time.  <b>-fdiagnostics-plain-output</b> is currently equivalent to the following  options:
           <b>-fno-diagnostics-show-caret</b>        <b>-fno-diagnostics-show-line-numbers</b>       <b>-fdiagnostics-color=never</b>
           <b>-fdiagnostics-urls=never</b> <b>-fdiagnostics-path-format=separate-events</b> In the future, if GCC changes  the
           default  appearance  of its diagnostics, the corresponding option to disable the new behavior will be
           added to this list.

       <b>-fdiagnostics-show-location=once</b>
           Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic messages  reporter  to  emit  source
           location  information <u>once</u>; that is, in case the message is too long to fit on a single physical line
           and has to be wrapped, the source location won't be emitted (as prefix)  again,  over  and  over,  in
           subsequent continuation lines.  This is the default behavior.

       <b>-fdiagnostics-show-location=every-line</b>
           Only  meaningful  in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic messages reporter to emit the same
           source location information (as prefix) for physical lines that result from the process of breaking a
           message which is too long to fit on a single line.

       <b>-fdiagnostics-color[=</b><u>WHEN</u><b>]</b>
       <b>-fno-diagnostics-color</b>
           Use color in diagnostics.  <u>WHEN</u> is <b>never</b>, <b>always</b>, or <b>auto</b>.  The default depends on how  the  compiler
           has  been configured, it can be any of the above <u>WHEN</u> options or also <b>never</b> if <b>GCC_COLORS</b> environment
           variable isn't present in the environment, and <b>auto</b> otherwise.  <b>auto</b> makes GCC use  color  only  when
           the  standard  error  is  a  terminal,  and  when  not  executing  in  an  emacs  shell.   The  forms
           <b>-fdiagnostics-color</b>  and  <b>-fno-diagnostics-color</b>  are  aliases  for  <b>-fdiagnostics-color=always</b>   and
           <b>-fdiagnostics-color=never</b>, respectively.

           The  colors  are defined by the environment variable <b>GCC_COLORS</b>.  Its value is a colon-separated list
           of capabilities and Select Graphic Rendition (SGR) substrings. SGR commands are  interpreted  by  the
           terminal  or  terminal  emulator.   (See  the  section in the documentation of your text terminal for
           permitted values and their meanings as character attributes.)  These substring values are integers in
           decimal representation and can be concatenated with semicolons.  Common values to concatenate include
           <b>1</b> for bold, <b>4</b> for underline, <b>5</b> for blink, <b>7</b> for inverse, <b>39</b> for default foreground color,  <b>30</b>  to  <b>37</b>
           for  foreground colors, <b>90</b> to <b>97</b> for 16-color mode foreground colors, <b>38;5;0</b> to <b>38;5;255</b> for 88-color
           and 256-color modes foreground colors, <b>49</b> for default background  color,  <b>40</b>  to  <b>47</b>  for  background
           colors,  <b>100</b>  to  <b>107</b>  for  16-color  mode background colors, and <b>48;5;0</b> to <b>48;5;255</b> for 88-color and
           256-color modes background colors.

           The default <b>GCC_COLORS</b> is

                   error=01;31:warning=01;35:note=01;36:range1=32:range2=34:locus=01:\
                   quote=01:path=01;36:fixit-insert=32:fixit-delete=31:\
                   diff-filename=01:diff-hunk=32:diff-delete=31:diff-insert=32:\
                   type-diff=01;32

           where <b>01;31</b> is bold red, <b>01;35</b> is bold magenta, <b>01;36</b> is bold cyan, <b>32</b> is green, <b>34</b> is  blue,  <b>01</b>  is
           bold, and <b>31</b> is red.  Setting <b>GCC_COLORS</b> to the empty string disables colors.  Supported capabilities
           are as follows.

           "error="
               SGR substring for error: markers.

           "warning="
               SGR substring for warning: markers.

           "note="
               SGR substring for note: markers.

           "path="
               SGR    substring    for    colorizing    paths    of   control-flow   events   as   printed   via
               <b>-fdiagnostics-path-format=</b>, such as the identifiers of individual  events  and  lines  indicating
               interprocedural calls and returns.

           "range1="
               SGR substring for first additional range.

           "range2="
               SGR substring for second additional range.

           "locus="
               SGR substring for location information, <b>file:line</b> or <b>file:line:column</b> etc.

           "quote="
               SGR substring for information printed within quotes.

           "fixit-insert="
               SGR substring for fix-it hints suggesting text to be inserted or replaced.

           "fixit-delete="
               SGR substring for fix-it hints suggesting text to be deleted.

           "diff-filename="
               SGR substring for filename headers within generated patches.

           "diff-hunk="
               SGR substring for the starts of hunks within generated patches.

           "diff-delete="
               SGR substring for deleted lines within generated patches.

           "diff-insert="
               SGR substring for inserted lines within generated patches.

           "type-diff="
               SGR substring for highlighting mismatching types within template arguments in the C++ frontend.

       <b>-fdiagnostics-urls[=</b><u>WHEN</u><b>]</b>
           Use escape sequences to embed URLs in diagnostics.  For example, when <b>-fdiagnostics-show-option</b> emits
           text  showing the command-line option controlling a diagnostic, embed a URL for documentation of that
           option.

           <u>WHEN</u> is <b>never</b>, <b>always</b>, or <b>auto</b>.  <b>auto</b> makes GCC use URL escape sequences only when the standard error
           is a terminal, and when not executing in an emacs shell or any graphical terminal which is  known  to
           be incompatible with this feature, see below.

           The  default  depends  on  how  the  compiler  has  been configured.  It can be any of the above <u>WHEN</u>
           options.

           GCC can also be configured (via the  <b>--with-diagnostics-urls=auto-if-env</b>  configure-time  option)  so
           that  the  default is affected by environment variables.  Under such a configuration, GCC defaults to
           using <b>auto</b> if either <b>GCC_URLS</b> or <b>TERM_URLS</b> environment variables are present  and  non-empty  in  the
           environment of the compiler, or <b>never</b> if neither are.

           However,  even  with  <b>-fdiagnostics-urls=always</b>  the  behavior  is  dependent  on  those  environment
           variables: If <b>GCC_URLS</b> is set to empty or <b>no</b>, do not embed URLs in diagnostics.  If set to  <b>st</b>,  URLs
           use  ST escape sequences.  If set to <b>bel</b>, the default, URLs use BEL escape sequences.  Any other non-
           empty value enables the feature.  If <b>GCC_URLS</b> is not set, use <b>TERM_URLS</b> as a fallback.  Note:  ST  is
           an  ANSI  escape  sequence,  string  terminator <b>ESC</b> <b>\</b>, BEL is an ASCII character, CTRL-G that usually
           sounds like a beep.

           At this time GCC tries to detect also a few terminals  that  are  known  to  not  implement  the  URL
           feature,  and  have  bugs  or at least had bugs in some versions that are still in use, where the URL
           escapes are likely to  misbehave,  i.e.  print  garbage  on  the  screen.   That  list  is  currently
           xfce4-terminal,  certain  known  to  be  buggy gnome-terminal versions, the linux console, and mingw.
           This check can be skipped with the <b>-fdiagnostics-urls=always</b>.

       <b>-fno-diagnostics-show-option</b>
           By default, each diagnostic emitted includes text indicating the command-line  option  that  directly
           controls  the  diagnostic  (if  such an option is known to the diagnostic machinery).  Specifying the
           <b>-fno-diagnostics-show-option</b> flag suppresses that behavior.

       <b>-fno-diagnostics-show-caret</b>
           By default, each diagnostic emitted includes the original source line and a caret  <b>^</b>  indicating  the
           column.   This  option suppresses this information.  The source line is truncated to <u>n</u> characters, if
           the <b>-fmessage-length=n</b> option is given.  When the output is  done  to  the  terminal,  the  width  is
           limited to the width given by the <b>COLUMNS</b> environment variable or, if not set, to the terminal width.

       <b>-fno-diagnostics-show-labels</b>
           By default, when printing source code (via <b>-fdiagnostics-show-caret</b>), diagnostics can label ranges of
           source code with pertinent information, such as the types of expressions:

                       printf ("foo %s bar", long_i + long_j);
                                    ~^       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                                     |              |
                                     char *         long int

           This  option suppresses the printing of these labels (in the example above, the vertical bars and the
           "char *" and "long int" text).

       <b>-fno-diagnostics-show-cwe</b>
           Diagnostic messages can optionally have  an  associated  @url{https://cwe.mitre.org/index.html,  CWE}
           identifier.   GCC  itself  only  provides  such metadata for some of the <b>-fanalyzer</b> diagnostics.  GCC
           plugins may also provide diagnostics with such metadata.  By default, if this information is present,
           it will be printed with the diagnostic.  This option suppresses the printing of this metadata.

       <b>-fno-diagnostics-show-line-numbers</b>
           By default, when printing source code (via  <b>-fdiagnostics-show-caret</b>),  a  left  margin  is  printed,
           showing line numbers.  This option suppresses this left margin.

       <b>-fdiagnostics-minimum-margin-width=</b><u>width</u>
           This option controls the minimum width of the left margin printed by <b>-fdiagnostics-show-line-numbers</b>.
           It defaults to 6.

       <b>-fdiagnostics-parseable-fixits</b>
           Emit  fix-it hints in a machine-parseable format, suitable for consumption by IDEs.  For each fix-it,
           a line will be printed after the relevant  diagnostic,  starting  with  the  string  "fix-it:".   For
           example:

                   fix-it:"test.c":{45:3-45:21}:"gtk_widget_show_all"

           The location is expressed as a half-open range, expressed as a count of bytes, starting at byte 1 for
           the  initial  column.   In  the  above  example,  bytes 3 through 20 of line 45 of "test.c" are to be
           replaced with the given string:

                   00000000011111111112222222222
                   12345678901234567890123456789
                     gtk_widget_showall (dlg);
                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                     gtk_widget_show_all

           The filename and replacement string escape backslash as "\\", tab as "\t", newline  as  "\n",  double
           quotes as "\"", non-printable characters as octal (e.g. vertical tab as "\013").

           An  empty  replacement  string indicates that the given range is to be removed.  An empty range (e.g.
           "45:3-45:3") indicates that the string is to be inserted at the given position.

       <b>-fdiagnostics-generate-patch</b>
           Print fix-it hints to stderr in unified diff format, after any diagnostics are printed.  For example:

                   --- test.c
                   +++ test.c
                   @ -42,5 +42,5 @

                    void show_cb(GtkDialog *dlg)
                    {
                   -  gtk_widget_showall(dlg);
                   +  gtk_widget_show_all(dlg);
                    }

           The  diff  may  or  may  not  be  colorized,  following  the  same  rules  as  for  diagnostics  (see
           <b>-fdiagnostics-color</b>).

       <b>-fdiagnostics-show-template-tree</b>
           In the C++ frontend, when printing diagnostics showing mismatching template types, such as:

                     could not convert 'std::map&lt;int, std::vector&lt;double&gt; &gt;()'
                       from 'map&lt;[...],vector&lt;double&gt;&gt;' to 'map&lt;[...],vector&lt;float&gt;&gt;

           the  <b>-fdiagnostics-show-template-tree</b>  flag enables printing a tree-like structure showing the common
           and differing parts of the types, such as:

                     map&lt;
                       [...],
                       vector&lt;
                         [double != float]&gt;&gt;

           The parts that differ are highlighted with color ("double" and "float" in this case).

       <b>-fno-elide-type</b>
           By default when the C++ frontend prints diagnostics showing mismatching template types, common  parts
           of the types are printed as "[...]" to simplify the error message.  For example:

                     could not convert 'std::map&lt;int, std::vector&lt;double&gt; &gt;()'
                       from 'map&lt;[...],vector&lt;double&gt;&gt;' to 'map&lt;[...],vector&lt;float&gt;&gt;

           Specifying  the  <b>-fno-elide-type</b> flag suppresses that behavior.  This flag also affects the output of
           the <b>-fdiagnostics-show-template-tree</b> flag.

       <b>-fdiagnostics-path-format=</b><u>KIND</u>
           Specify how to print paths of control-flow events for diagnostics that have such  a  path  associated
           with them.

           <u>KIND</u> is <b>none</b>, <b>separate-events</b>, or <b>inline-events</b>, the default.

           <b>none</b> means to not print diagnostic paths.

           <b>separate-events</b>  means  to  print  a separate "note" diagnostic for each event within the diagnostic.
           For example:

                   test.c:29:5: error: passing NULL as argument 1 to 'PyList_Append' which requires a non-NULL parameter
                   test.c:25:10: note: (1) when 'PyList_New' fails, returning NULL
                   test.c:27:3: note: (2) when 'i &lt; count'
                   test.c:29:5: note: (3) when calling 'PyList_Append', passing NULL from (1) as argument 1

           <b>inline-events</b> means to print the events "inline" within the  source  code.   This  view  attempts  to
           consolidate  the  events  into  runs  of  sufficiently-close events, printing them as labelled ranges
           within the source.

           For example, the same events as above might be printed as:

                     'test': events 1-3
                       |
                       |   25 |   list = <a href="../man0/PyList_New.0.html">PyList_New</a>(0);
                       |      |          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~
                       |      |          |
                       |      |          (1) when 'PyList_New' fails, returning NULL
                       |   26 |
                       |   27 |   for (i = 0; i &lt; count; i++) {
                       |      |   ~~~
                       |      |   |
                       |      |   (2) when 'i &lt; count'
                       |   28 |     item = PyLong_FromLong(random());
                       |   29 |     PyList_Append(list, item);
                       |      |     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                       |      |     |
                       |      |     (3) when calling 'PyList_Append', passing NULL from (1) as argument 1
                       |

           Interprocedural control flow is shown by grouping the events by stack frame, and using indentation to
           show how stack frames are nested, pushed, and popped.

           For example:

                     'test': events 1-2

       <b>-fdiagnostics-show-path-depths</b>
           This option provides additional information  when  printing  control-flow  paths  associated  with  a
           diagnostic.

           If  this  is  option  is  provided then the stack depth will be printed for each run of events within
           <b>-fdiagnostics-path-format=separate-events</b>.

           This is intended for use by GCC developers and plugin  developers  when  debugging  diagnostics  that
           report interprocedural control flow.

       <b>-fno-show-column</b>
           Do  not  print column numbers in diagnostics.  This may be necessary if diagnostics are being scanned
           by a program that does not understand the column numbers, such as <b>dejagnu</b>.

       <b>-fdiagnostics-column-unit=</b><u>UNIT</u>
           Select the units for the column number.  This affects traditional  diagnostics  (in  the  absence  of
           <b>-fno-show-column</b>), as well as JSON format diagnostics if requested.

           The  default <u>UNIT</u>, <b>display</b>, considers the number of display columns occupied by each character.  This
           may be larger than the number of bytes  required  to  encode  the  character,  in  the  case  of  tab
           characters,  or  it  may be smaller, in the case of multibyte characters.  For example, the character
           "GREEK SMALL LETTER PI (U+03C0)" occupies one display column, and its  UTF-8  encoding  requires  two
           bytes;  the  character  "SLIGHTLY SMILING FACE (U+1F642)" occupies two display columns, and its UTF-8
           encoding requires four bytes.

           Setting <u>UNIT</u> to <b>byte</b> changes the  column  number  to  the  raw  byte  count  in  all  cases,  as  was
           traditionally output by GCC prior to version 11.1.0.

       <b>-fdiagnostics-column-origin=</b><u>ORIGIN</u>
           Select  the  origin  for  column  numbers,  i.e. the column number assigned to the first column.  The
           default value of 1 corresponds to traditional  GCC  behavior  and  to  the  GNU  style  guide.   Some
           utilities may perform better with an origin of 0; any non-negative value may be specified.

       <b>-fdiagnostics-format=</b><u>FORMAT</u>
           Select a different format for printing diagnostics.  <u>FORMAT</u> is <b>text</b> or <b>json</b>.  The default is <b>text</b>.

           The  <b>json</b>  format  consists  of  a  top-level  JSON  array  containing  JSON objects representing the
           diagnostics.

           The JSON is emitted as one line, without formatting; the  examples  below  have  been  formatted  for
           clarity.

           Diagnostics can have child diagnostics.  For example, this error and note:

                   misleading-indentation.c:15:3: warning: this 'if' clause does not
                     guard... [-Wmisleading-indentation]

                   misleading-indentation.c:17:5: note: ...this statement, but the latter

                         |     ^

                   ]

           where the "note" is a child of the "warning".

           A  diagnostic  has  a  "kind".   If  this  is "warning", then there is an "option" key describing the
           command-line option controlling the warning.

           A diagnostic can contain zero or more locations.  Each location has an optional "label" string and up
           to three positions within it: a "caret" position and optional  "start"  and  "finish"  positions.   A
           position  is  described  by  a  "file"  name,  a "line" number, and three numbers indicating a column
           position:

           *   "display-column" counts display columns, accounting for tabs and multibyte characters.

           *   "byte-column" counts raw bytes.

           *   "column" is equal to one of the  previous  two,  as  dictated  by  the  <b>-fdiagnostics-column-unit</b>
               option.

           All  three  columns  are  relative  to  the origin specified by <b>-fdiagnostics-column-origin</b>, which is
           typically equal to 1 but may be set, for instance, to 0 for compatibility with other  utilities  that
           number  columns from 0.  The column origin is recorded in the JSON output in the "column-origin" tag.
           In the remaining examples below, the extra column number outputs have been omitted for brevity.

           For example, this error:

                   bad-binary-ops.c:64:23: error: invalid operands to binary + (have 'S' {aka
                      'struct s'} and 'T' {aka 'struct t'})

           has three locations.  Its primary location is at the "+" token at column 23.  It  has  two  secondary
           locations,  describing  the left and right-hand sides of the expression, which have labels.  It might
           be printed in JSON form as:

                           "children": [],

                                   },

                                       "column": 21, "file": "bad-binary-ops.c", "line": 64
                                   },

                           "message": "invalid operands to binary + ..."
                       }

           If a diagnostic contains fix-it hints, it has a "fixits" array, consisting  of  half-open  intervals,
           similar  to  the  output  of  <b>-fdiagnostics-parseable-fixits</b>.   For  example,  this diagnostic with a
           replacement fix-it hint:

           might be printed in JSON form as:

                               }

                       }

           where the fix-it hint suggests replacing the text from "start" up to but not  including  "next"  with
           "string"'s  value.   Deletions  are  expressed  via an empty value for "string", insertions by having
           "start" equal "next".

           If the diagnostic has a path of control-flow events associated with it, it  has  a  "path"  array  of
           objects  representing the events.  Each event object has a "description" string, a "location" object,
           along with a "function" string and a "depth" number  for  representing  interprocedural  paths.   The
           "function"  represents the current function at that event, and the "depth" represents the stack depth
           relative to some baseline: the higher, the more frames are within the stack.

           For example, the intraprocedural example shown for <b>-fdiagnostics-path-format=</b> might  have  this  JSON
           for its path:

                       "path": [
                           {
                               "depth": 0,
                               "description": "when 'PyList_New' fails, returning NULL",
                               "function": "test",

   <b>Options</b> <b>to</b> <b>Request</b> <b>or</b> <b>Suppress</b> <b>Warnings</b>
       Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions that are not inherently erroneous but that are
       risky or suggest there may have been an error.

       The  following  language-independent  options  do  not  enable specific warnings but control the kinds of
       diagnostics produced by GCC.

       <b>-fsyntax-only</b>
           Check the code for syntax errors, but don't do anything beyond that.

       <b>-fmax-errors=</b><u>n</u>
           Limits the maximum number of error messages to <u>n</u>, at which point GCC bails out rather than attempting
           to continue processing the source code.  If <u>n</u> is 0 (the default), there is no limit on the number  of
           error  messages  produced.  If <b>-Wfatal-errors</b> is also specified, then <b>-Wfatal-errors</b> takes precedence
           over this option.

       <b>-w</b>  Inhibit all warning messages.

       <b>-Werror</b>
           Make all warnings into errors.

       <b>-Werror=</b>
           Make the specified warning into an error.  The specifier for  a  warning  is  appended;  for  example
           <b>-Werror=switch</b>  turns  the warnings controlled by <b>-Wswitch</b> into errors.  This switch takes a negative
           form, to be used to negate  <b>-Werror</b>  for  specific  warnings;  for  example  <b>-Wno-error=switch</b>  makes
           <b>-Wswitch</b> warnings not be errors, even when <b>-Werror</b> is in effect.

           The  warning  message  for  each  controllable warning includes the option that controls the warning.
           That option can then be used with <b>-Werror=</b> and <b>-Wno-error=</b> as  described  above.   (Printing  of  the
           option in the warning message can be disabled using the <b>-fno-diagnostics-show-option</b> flag.)

           Note that specifying <b>-Werror=</b><u>foo</u> automatically implies <b>-W</b><u>foo</u>.  However, <b>-Wno-error=</b><u>foo</u> does not imply
           anything.

       <b>-Wfatal-errors</b>
           This  option  causes the compiler to abort compilation on the first error occurred rather than trying
           to keep going and printing further error messages.

       You can request many specific warnings with options beginning with <b>-W</b>, for example <b>-Wimplicit</b> to  request
       warnings  on  implicit  declarations.   Each  of  these specific warning options also has a negative form
       beginning <b>-Wno-</b> to turn off warnings; for example, <b>-Wno-implicit</b>.  This manual lists only one of the  two
       forms,  whichever  is  not  the default.  For further language-specific options also refer to <b>C++</b> <b>Dialect</b>
       <b>Options</b> and <b>Objective-C</b> <b>and</b> <b>Objective-C++</b> <b>Dialect</b>  <b>Options</b>.   Additional  warnings  can  be  produced  by
       enabling the static analyzer;

       Some  options,  such  as  <b>-Wall</b>  and  <b>-Wextra</b>, turn on other options, such as <b>-Wunused</b>, which may turn on
       further options, such as <b>-Wunused-value</b>. The combined effect of positive and negative forms is that  more
       specific  options  have priority over less specific ones, independently of their position in the command-
       line. For options of the same specificity, the last one takes effect. Options  enabled  or  disabled  via
       pragmas take effect as if they appeared at the end of the command-line.

       When  an  unrecognized  warning  option  is  requested  (e.g., <b>-Wunknown-warning</b>), GCC emits a diagnostic
       stating that the option is not recognized.  However, if the <b>-Wno-</b> form is used, the behavior is  slightly
       different:  no  diagnostic  is  produced  for  <b>-Wno-unknown-warning</b>  unless  other  diagnostics are being
       produced.  This allows the use of new <b>-Wno-</b> options with old compilers, but if something goes wrong,  the
       compiler warns that an unrecognized option is present.

       The   effectiveness   of  some  warnings  depends  on  optimizations  also  being  enabled.  For  example
       <b>-Wsuggest-final-types</b> is more effective with link-time optimization and  <b>-Wmaybe-uninitialized</b>  does  not
       warn at all unless optimization is enabled.

       <b>-Wpedantic</b>
       <b>-pedantic</b>
           Issue  all  the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++; reject all programs that use forbidden
           extensions, and some other programs that do not follow ISO C and ISO C++.  For  ISO  C,  follows  the
           version of the ISO C standard specified by any <b>-std</b> option used.

           Valid  ISO  C and ISO C++ programs should compile properly with or without this option (though a rare
           few require <b>-ansi</b> or a <b>-std</b> option specifying the required version of ISO C).  However, without  this
           option,  certain  GNU extensions and traditional C and C++ features are supported as well.  With this
           option, they are rejected.

           <b>-Wpedantic</b> does not cause warning messages for use of the alternate keywords whose  names  begin  and
           end  with  <b>__</b>.   This alternate format can also be used to disable warnings for non-ISO <b>__intN</b> types,
           i.e. <b>__intN__</b>.  Pedantic warnings are also disabled in the expression that  follows  "__extension__".
           However,  only  system header files should use these escape routes; application programs should avoid
           them.

           Some users try to use <b>-Wpedantic</b> to check programs for strict ISO C conformance.  They soon find that
           it does not do quite what they want: it finds some non-ISO practices, but not  all---only  those  for
           which ISO C <u>requires</u> a diagnostic, and some others for which diagnostics have been added.

           A  feature  to  report  any  failure to conform to ISO C might be useful in some instances, but would
           require considerable additional work and would be quite different from  <b>-Wpedantic</b>.   We  don't  have
           plans to support such a feature in the near future.

           Where  the  standard  specified  with  <b>-std</b>  represents a GNU extended dialect of C, such as <b>gnu90</b> or
           <b>gnu99</b>, there is a corresponding <u>base</u> <u>standard</u>, the version of ISO C on which the GNU extended dialect
           is based.  Warnings from <b>-Wpedantic</b> are given where they are required by the base standard.  (It does
           not make sense for such warnings to be given only for features not in the specified  GNU  C  dialect,
           since  by  definition the GNU dialects of C include all features the compiler supports with the given
           option, and there would be nothing to warn about.)

       <b>-pedantic-errors</b>
           Give an error whenever the <u>base</u> <u>standard</u> (see <b>-Wpedantic</b>) requires a diagnostic, in some cases  where
           there  is  undefined behavior at compile-time and in some other cases that do not prevent compilation
           of programs that are valid according to the standard. This is  not  equivalent  to  <b>-Werror=pedantic</b>,
           since there are errors enabled by this option and not enabled by the latter and vice versa.

       <b>-Wall</b>
           This enables all the warnings about constructions that some users consider questionable, and that are
           easy to avoid (or modify to prevent the warning), even in conjunction with macros.  This also enables
           some  language-specific  warnings  described in <b>C++</b> <b>Dialect</b> <b>Options</b> and <b>Objective-C</b> <b>and</b> <b>Objective-C++</b>
           <b>Dialect</b> <b>Options</b>.

           <b>-Wall</b> turns on the following warning flags:

           <b>-Waddress</b>  <b>-Warray-bounds=1</b>  (only  with  <b>-O2</b>)   <b>-Warray-parameter=2</b>   (C   and   Objective-C   only)

           <b>-Wzero-length-bounds</b>

           Note that some warning flags are not implied by <b>-Wall</b>.  Some of them warn  about  constructions  that
           users  generally  do  not  consider questionable, but which occasionally you might wish to check for;
           others warn about constructions that are necessary or hard to avoid in some cases, and  there  is  no
           simple  way  to modify the code to suppress the warning. Some of them are enabled by <b>-Wextra</b> but many
           of them must be enabled individually.

       <b>-Wextra</b>
           This enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled by <b>-Wall</b>. (This option used to  be  called
           <b>-W</b>.  The older name is still supported, but the newer name is more descriptive.)

           <b>-Wclobbered</b> <b>-Wcast-function-type</b> <b>-Wdeprecated-copy</b> (C++ only) <b>-Wempty-body</b> <b>-Wenum-conversion</b> (C only)
           <b>-Wignored-qualifiers</b>  <b>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=3</b>  <b>-Wmissing-field-initializers</b> <b>-Wmissing-parameter-type</b>
           (C only) <b>-Wold-style-declaration</b> (C only) <b>-Woverride-init</b> <b>-Wsign-compare</b>  (C  only)  <b>-Wstring-compare</b>
           <b>-Wredundant-move</b>  (only  for  C++)  <b>-Wtype-limits</b> <b>-Wuninitialized</b> <b>-Wshift-negative-value</b> (in C++11 to
           C++17   and   in   C99   and   newer)   <b>-Wunused-parameter</b>   (only   with    <b>-Wunused</b>    or    <b>-Wall</b>)
           <b>-Wunused-but-set-parameter</b> (only with <b>-Wunused</b> or <b>-Wall</b>)

           The option <b>-Wextra</b> also prints warning messages for the following cases:

           *   A pointer is compared against integer zero with "&lt;", "&lt;=", "&gt;", or "&gt;=".

           *   (C++ only) An enumerator and a non-enumerator both appear in a conditional expression.

           *   (C++ only) Ambiguous virtual bases.

           *   (C++ only) Subscripting an array that has been declared "register".

           *   (C++ only) Taking the address of a variable that has been declared "register".

           *   (C++ only) A base class is not initialized in the copy constructor of a derived class.

       <b>-Wabi</b> (C, Objective-C, C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn  about  code  affected  by  ABI changes.  This includes code that may not be compatible with the
           vendor-neutral C++ ABI as well as the psABI for the particular target.

           Since G++ now defaults to updating the ABI with each major release, normally <b>-Wabi</b> warns  only  about
           C++  ABI  compatibility problems if there is a check added later in a release series for an ABI issue
           discovered since the initial release.  <b>-Wabi</b> warns about more things  if  an  older  ABI  version  is
           selected (with <b>-fabi-version=</b><u>n</u>).

           <b>-Wabi</b>  can  also  be  used with an explicit version number to warn about C++ ABI compatibility with a
           particular <b>-fabi-version</b> level, e.g. <b>-Wabi=2</b> to warn about changes relative to <b>-fabi-version=2</b>.

           If an explicit version number is provided and <b>-fabi-compat-version</b>  is  not  specified,  the  version
           number from this option is used for compatibility aliases.  If no explicit version number is provided
           with  this  option,  but  <b>-fabi-compat-version</b>  is specified, that version number is used for C++ ABI
           warnings.

           Although an effort has been made to warn about all such cases, there are probably some cases that are
           not warned about, even though G++ is generating incompatible code.  There may  also  be  cases  where
           warnings are emitted even though the code that is generated is compatible.

           You  should  rewrite  your code to avoid these warnings if you are concerned about the fact that code
           generated by G++ may not be binary compatible with code generated by other compilers.

           Known incompatibilities in <b>-fabi-version=2</b> (which was the default from GCC 3.4 to 4.9) include:

           *   A template with a non-type template parameter of reference type was mangled incorrectly:

                       extern int N;
                       template &lt;int &amp;&gt; struct S {};
                       void n (S&lt;N&gt;) {2}

               This was fixed in <b>-fabi-version=3</b>.

           *   SIMD vector types declared using "__attribute ((vector_size))" were mangled in a non-standard way
               that does not allow for overloading of functions taking vectors of different sizes.

               The mangling was changed in <b>-fabi-version=4</b>.

           *   "__attribute ((const))" and "noreturn" were mangled as type qualifiers, and "decltype" of a plain
               declaration was folded away.

               These mangling issues were fixed in <b>-fabi-version=5</b>.

           *   Scoped enumerators passed as  arguments  to  a  variadic  function  are  promoted  like  unscoped
               enumerators,  causing  "va_arg"  to  complain.  On most targets this does not actually affect the
               parameter passing ABI, as there is no way to pass an argument smaller than "int".

               Also, the ABI changed the mangling  of  template  argument  packs,  "const_cast",  "static_cast",
               prefix increment/decrement, and a class scope function used as a template argument.

               These issues were corrected in <b>-fabi-version=6</b>.

           *   Lambdas  in  default argument scope were mangled incorrectly, and the ABI changed the mangling of
               "nullptr_t".

               These issues were corrected in <b>-fabi-version=7</b>.

           *   When mangling a function type with function-cv-qualifiers, the  un-qualified  function  type  was
               incorrectly treated as a substitution candidate.

               This was fixed in <b>-fabi-version=8</b>, the default for GCC 5.1.

           *   decltype(nullptr)  incorrectly  had  an alignment of 1, leading to unaligned accesses.  Note that
               this did not affect the ABI of a function with a "nullptr_t"  parameter,  as  parameters  have  a
               minimum alignment.

               This was fixed in <b>-fabi-version=9</b>, the default for GCC 5.2.

           *   Target-specific  attributes  that affect the identity of a type, such as ia32 calling conventions
               on a function type (stdcall, regparm, etc.), did not affect the mangled  name,  leading  to  name
               collisions when function pointers were used as template arguments.

               This was fixed in <b>-fabi-version=10</b>, the default for GCC 6.1.

           This option also enables warnings about psABI-related changes.  The known psABI changes at this point
           include:

           *   For  SysV/x86-64,  unions  with "long double" members are passed in memory as specified in psABI.
               Prior to GCC 4.4, this was not the case.  For example:

                       union U {
                         long double ld;
                         int i;
                       };

               "union U" is now always passed in memory.

       <b>-Wchar-subscripts</b>
           Warn if an array subscript has type "char".  This is a common cause of error,  as  programmers  often
           forget that this type is signed on some machines.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wno-coverage-mismatch</b>
           Warn  if  feedback  profiles  do  not match when using the <b>-fprofile-use</b> option.  If a source file is
           changed between compiling with <b>-fprofile-generate</b> and with <b>-fprofile-use</b>, the files with the  profile
           feedback  can  fail to match the source file and GCC cannot use the profile feedback information.  By
           default, this warning is enabled and is treated as an error.  <b>-Wno-coverage-mismatch</b> can be  used  to
           disable  the warning or <b>-Wno-error=coverage-mismatch</b> can be used to disable the error.  Disabling the
           error for this warning can result in poorly optimized code and is useful only in  the  case  of  very
           minor  changes  such  as bug fixes to an existing code-base.  Completely disabling the warning is not
           recommended.

       <b>-Wno-cpp</b>
           (C, Objective-C, C++, Objective-C++ and Fortran only) Suppress warning messages emitted by "#warning"
           directives.

       <b>-Wdouble-promotion</b> (C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)
           Give a warning when a value of type "float" is implicitly promoted to "double".  CPUs with  a  32-bit
           "single-precision"  floating-point  unit  implement  "float"  in  hardware,  but  emulate "double" in
           software.  On such a machine, doing computations using "double" values is much more expensive because
           of the overhead required for software emulation.

           It is easy to  accidentally  do  computations  with  "double"  because  floating-point  literals  are
           implicitly of type "double".  For example, in:

                   float area(float radius)
                   {
                      return 3.14159 * radius * radius;
                   }

           the  compiler  performs  the entire computation with "double" because the floating-point literal is a
           "double".

       <b>-Wduplicate-decl-specifier</b> (C and Objective-C only)
           Warn if a declaration has duplicate "const", "volatile", "restrict"  or  "_Atomic"  specifier.   This
           warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wformat</b>
       <b>-Wformat=</b><u>n</u>
           Check  calls  to  "printf"  and  "scanf",  etc.,  to make sure that the arguments supplied have types
           appropriate to the format string specified, and that the conversions specified in the  format  string
           make  sense.   This  includes  standard  functions, and others specified by format attributes, in the
           "printf", "scanf", "strftime" and "strfmon" (an X/Open extension, not in the C standard) families (or
           other target-specific families).  Which functions are checked without format attributes  having  been
           specified  depends  on  the  standard  version  selected,  and  such  checks of functions without the
           attribute specified are disabled by <b>-ffreestanding</b> or <b>-fno-builtin</b>.

           The formats are checked against the format features supported by GNU libc version 2.2.  These include
           all ISO C90 and C99 features, as well as features from the Single Unix Specification and some BSD and
           GNU extensions.  Other library implementations may not support  all  these  features;  GCC  does  not
           support  warning  about  features  that  go  beyond  a particular library's limitations.  However, if
           <b>-Wpedantic</b> is used with <b>-Wformat</b>, warnings are given  about  format  features  not  in  the  selected
           standard  version  (but  not  for  "strfmon"  formats,  since  those  are not in any version of the C
           standard).

           <b>-Wformat=1</b>
           <b>-Wformat</b>
               Option <b>-Wformat</b> is equivalent to <b>-Wformat=1</b>, and <b>-Wno-format</b> is equivalent to <b>-Wformat=0</b>.   Since
               <b>-Wformat</b>  also  checks  for  null  format  arguments for several functions, <b>-Wformat</b> also implies
               <b>-Wnonnull</b>.  Some aspects of this level of  format  checking  can  be  disabled  by  the  options:
               <b>-Wno-format-contains-nul</b>,   <b>-Wno-format-extra-args</b>,  and  <b>-Wno-format-zero-length</b>.   <b>-Wformat</b>  is
               enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

           <b>-Wformat=2</b>
               Enable  <b>-Wformat</b>   plus   additional   format   checks.    Currently   equivalent   to   <b>-Wformat</b>
               <b>-Wformat-nonliteral</b> <b>-Wformat-security</b> <b>-Wformat-y2k</b>.

       <b>-Wno-format-contains-nul</b>
           If <b>-Wformat</b> is specified, do not warn about format strings that contain NUL bytes.

       <b>-Wno-format-extra-args</b>
           If  <b>-Wformat</b>  is  specified,  do  not  warn  about  excess  arguments to a "printf" or "scanf" format
           function.  The C standard specifies that such arguments are ignored.

           Where the unused arguments lie between used arguments  that  are  specified  with  <b>$</b>  operand  number
           specifications,  normally warnings are still given, since the implementation could not know what type
           to pass to "va_arg" to skip the unused arguments.  However, in the  case  of  "scanf"  formats,  this
           option  suppresses  the  warning  if  the  unused  arguments  are all pointers, since the Single Unix
           Specification says that such unused arguments are allowed.

       <b>-Wformat-overflow</b>
       <b>-Wformat-overflow=</b><u>level</u>
           Warn about calls to formatted input/output functions such as  "sprintf"  and  "vsprintf"  that  might
           overflow the destination buffer.  When the exact number of bytes written by a format directive cannot
           be  determined  at compile-time it is estimated based on heuristics that depend on the <u>level</u> argument
           and on optimization.  While enabling optimization will in most cases  improve  the  accuracy  of  the
           warning, it may also result in false positives.

           <b>-Wformat-overflow</b>
           <b>-Wformat-overflow=1</b>
               Level  <u>1</u> of <b>-Wformat-overflow</b> enabled by <b>-Wformat</b> employs a conservative approach that warns only
               about calls that most likely overflow the buffer.  At this level,  numeric  arguments  to  format
               directives  with  unknown  values  are  assumed  to have the value of one, and strings of unknown
               length to be empty.  Numeric arguments that are known to be bounded to a subrange of their  type,
               or  string arguments whose output is bounded either by their directive's precision or by a finite
               set of string literals, are assumed to take on the value within the range  that  results  in  the
               most  bytes  on  output.  For example, the call to "sprintf" below is diagnosed because even with
               both <u>a</u> and <u>b</u> equal to zero, the terminating NUL character ('\0') appended by the function to  the
               destination  buffer  will be written past its end.  Increasing the size of the buffer by a single
               byte is sufficient to avoid the warning, though it may not be sufficient to avoid the overflow.

                       void f (int a, int b)
                       {
                         char buf [13];
                         sprintf (buf, "a = %i, b = %i\n", a, b);
                       }

           <b>-Wformat-overflow=2</b>
               Level <u>2</u> warns also about calls that might overflow the destination buffer given  an  argument  of
               sufficient  length  or  magnitude.  At level <u>2</u>, unknown numeric arguments are assumed to have the
               minimum representable value for signed types with a precision greater than  1,  and  the  maximum
               representable  value  otherwise.   Unknown  string arguments whose length cannot be assumed to be
               bounded either by the directive's precision, or by a finite  set  of  string  literals  they  may
               evaluate to, or the character array they may point to, are assumed to be 1 character long.

               At  level <u>2</u>, the call in the example above is again diagnosed, but this time because with <u>a</u> equal
               to a 32-bit "INT_MIN" the first %i directive will write some of its digits beyond the end of  the
               destination  buffer.   To  make  the call safe regardless of the values of the two variables, the
               size of the destination buffer must be increased to at least 34 bytes.  GCC includes the  minimum
               size of the buffer in an informational note following the warning.

               An  alternative  to  increasing  the  size of the destination buffer is to constrain the range of
               formatted values.  The maximum length of string  arguments  can  be  bounded  by  specifying  the
               precision in the format directive.  When numeric arguments of format directives can be assumed to
               be  bounded  by less than the precision of their type, choosing an appropriate length modifier to
               the format specifier will reduce the required buffer size.  For  example,  if  <u>a</u>  and  <u>b</u>  in  the
               example above can be assumed to be within the precision of the "short int" type then using either
               the  %hi format directive or casting the argument to "short" reduces the maximum required size of
               the buffer to 24 bytes.

                       void f (int a, int b)
                       {
                         char buf [23];
                         sprintf (buf, "a = %hi, b = %i\n", a, (short)b);
                       }

       <b>-Wno-format-zero-length</b>
           If <b>-Wformat</b> is specified, do not warn about zero-length formats.  The C standard specifies that zero-
           length formats are allowed.

       <b>-Wformat-nonliteral</b>
           If <b>-Wformat</b> is specified, also warn if the format string is not a string literal  and  so  cannot  be
           checked, unless the format function takes its format arguments as a "va_list".

       <b>-Wformat-security</b>
           If  <b>-Wformat</b>  is specified, also warn about uses of format functions that represent possible security
           problems.  At present, this warns about calls to "printf" and  "scanf"  functions  where  the  format
           string is not a string literal and there are no format arguments, as in "printf (foo);".  This may be
           a security hole if the format string came from untrusted input and contains <b>%n</b>.  (This is currently a
           subset   of   what  <b>-Wformat-nonliteral</b>  warns  about,  but  in  future  warnings  may  be  added  to
           <b>-Wformat-security</b> that are not included in <b>-Wformat-nonliteral</b>.)

       <b>-Wformat-signedness</b>
           If <b>-Wformat</b> is specified, also warn if the format  string  requires  an  unsigned  argument  and  the
           argument is signed and vice versa.

       <b>-Wformat-truncation</b>
       <b>-Wformat-truncation=</b><u>level</u>
           Warn  about  calls  to formatted input/output functions such as "snprintf" and "vsnprintf" that might
           result in output truncation.  When the exact number of bytes written by a format directive cannot  be
           determined  at compile-time it is estimated based on heuristics that depend on the <u>level</u> argument and
           on optimization.  While enabling optimization will in most cases improve the accuracy of the warning,
           it may also result in false positives.  Except as noted otherwise, the option  uses  the  same  logic
           <b>-Wformat-overflow</b>.

           <b>-Wformat-truncation</b>
           <b>-Wformat-truncation=1</b>
               Level  <u>1</u>  of  <b>-Wformat-truncation</b>  enabled by <b>-Wformat</b> employs a conservative approach that warns
               only about calls to bounded functions whose return value is unused  and  that  will  most  likely
               result in output truncation.

           <b>-Wformat-truncation=2</b>
               Level  <u>2</u>  warns  also  about calls to bounded functions whose return value is used and that might
               result in truncation given an argument of sufficient length or magnitude.

       <b>-Wformat-y2k</b>
           If <b>-Wformat</b> is specified, also warn about "strftime" formats that may yield only a two-digit year.

       <b>-Wnonnull</b>
           Warn about passing a null pointer for arguments marked as requiring a non-null value by the "nonnull"
           function attribute.

           <b>-Wnonnull</b> is included in <b>-Wall</b> and <b>-Wformat</b>.  It can be disabled with the <b>-Wno-nonnull</b> option.

       <b>-Wnonnull-compare</b>
           Warn when comparing an argument marked with the "nonnull" function attribute against null inside  the
           function.

           <b>-Wnonnull-compare</b> is included in <b>-Wall</b>.  It can be disabled with the <b>-Wno-nonnull-compare</b> option.

       <b>-Wnull-dereference</b>
           Warn  if the compiler detects paths that trigger erroneous or undefined behavior due to dereferencing
           a null pointer.  This option is only active when <b>-fdelete-null-pointer-checks</b>  is  active,  which  is
           enabled  by optimizations in most targets.  The precision of the warnings depends on the optimization
           options used.

       <b>-Winit-self</b> (C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn about uninitialized variables that are initialized with themselves.  Note this option  can  only
           be used with the <b>-Wuninitialized</b> option.

           For  example,  GCC warns about "i" being uninitialized in the following snippet only when <b>-Winit-self</b>
           has been specified:

                   int f()
                   {
                     int i = i;
                     return i;
                   }

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b> in C++.

       <b>-Wno-implicit-int</b> (C and Objective-C only)
           This option controls warnings when a declaration does not specify a type.  This warning is enabled by
           default in C99 and later dialects of C, and also by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wno-implicit-function-declaration</b> (C and Objective-C only)
           This option controls warnings when a function is used before being declared.  This warning is enabled
           by default in C99 and later dialects of C, and also by <b>-Wall</b>.  The warning is made into an  error  by
           <b>-pedantic-errors</b>.

       <b>-Wimplicit</b> (C and Objective-C only)
           Same as <b>-Wimplicit-int</b> and <b>-Wimplicit-function-declaration</b>.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wimplicit-fallthrough</b>
           <b>-Wimplicit-fallthrough</b>  is  the same as <b>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=3</b> and <b>-Wno-implicit-fallthrough</b> is the
           same as <b>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=0</b>.

       <b>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=</b><u>n</u>
           Warn when a switch case falls through.  For example:

                   switch (cond)
                     {
                     case 1:
                       a = 1;
                       break;
                     case 2:
                       a = 2;
                     case 3:
                       a = 3;
                       break;
                     }

           This warning does not warn when the last statement of a case cannot fall through, e.g. when there  is
           a   return   statement   or   a   call   to   function   declared   with   the   noreturn  attribute.
           <b>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=</b> also takes into account control flow statements, such as ifs, and only  warns
           when appropriate.  E.g.

                   switch (cond)
                     {
                     case 1:
                       if (i &gt; 3) {
                         bar (5);
                         break;
                       } else if (i &lt; 1) {
                         bar (0);
                       } else
                         return;
                     default:
                       ...
                     }

           Since  there  are occasions where a switch case fall through is desirable, GCC provides an attribute,
           "__attribute__ ((fallthrough))", that is to be used along with a  null  statement  to  suppress  this
           warning that would normally occur:

                   switch (cond)
                     {
                     case 1:
                       bar (0);
                       __attribute__ ((fallthrough));
                     default:
                       ...
                     }

           C++17 provides a standard way to suppress the <b>-Wimplicit-fallthrough</b> warning using "[[fallthrough]];"
           instead  of  the  GNU attribute.  In C++11 or C++14 users can use "[[gnu::fallthrough]];", which is a
           GNU extension.  Instead of these attributes, it is also possible to  add  a  fallthrough  comment  to
           silence  the  warning.   The  whole body of the C or C++ style comment should match the given regular
           expressions listed below.  The option argument <u>n</u> specifies what kind of comments are accepted:

           *&lt;<b>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=0</b> disables the warning altogether.&gt;
           *&lt;<b>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=1</b> matches ".*" regular&gt;
               expression, any comment is used as fallthrough comment.

           *&lt;<b>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=2</b> case insensitively matches&gt;
               ".*falls?[ \t-]*thr(ough|u).*" regular expression.

           *&lt;<b>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=3</b> case sensitively matches one of the&gt;
               following regular expressions:

               *&lt;"-fallthrough"&gt;
               *&lt;"@fallthrough@"&gt;

           The <b>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=3</b> warning is enabled by <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-Wno-if-not-aligned</b> (C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)
           Control  if  warnings  triggered  by  the  "warn_if_not_aligned"  attribute  should be issued.  These
           warnings are enabled by default.

       <b>-Wignored-qualifiers</b> (C and C++ only)
           Warn if the return type of a function has a type qualifier such as "const".  For ISO C  such  a  type
           qualifier  has  no  effect,  since  the  value returned by a function is not an lvalue.  For C++, the
           warning is only emitted for scalar types or "void".  ISO C prohibits qualified "void" return types on
           function definitions, so such return types always receive a warning even without this option.

           This warning is also enabled by <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-Wno-ignored-attributes</b> (C and C++ only)
           This option controls warnings when an attribute is ignored.  This is different from the  <b>-Wattributes</b>
           option in that it warns whenever the compiler decides to drop an attribute, not that the attribute is
           either unknown, used in a wrong place, etc.  This warning is enabled by default.

       <b>-Wmain</b>
           Warn  if  the  type  of  "main"  is  suspicious.   "main" should be a function with external linkage,
           returning int, taking either zero arguments, two, or three  arguments  of  appropriate  types.   This
           warning is enabled by default in C++ and is enabled by either <b>-Wall</b> or <b>-Wpedantic</b>.

       <b>-Wmisleading-indentation</b> (C and C++ only)
           Warn  when the indentation of the code does not reflect the block structure.  Specifically, a warning
           is issued for "if", "else", "while", and "for" clauses with a guarded statement  that  does  not  use
           braces, followed by an unguarded statement with the same indentation.

           In  the  following  example,  the call to "bar" is misleadingly indented as if it were guarded by the
           "if" conditional.

                     if (some_condition ())
                       foo ();
                       bar ();  /* Gotcha: this is not guarded by the "if".  */

           In the case of mixed tabs and spaces, the warning uses the <b>-ftabstop=</b>  option  to  determine  if  the
           statements line up (defaulting to 8).

           The  warning  is  not  issued  for  code involving multiline preprocessor logic such as the following
           example.

                     if (flagA)
                       foo (0);
                   #if SOME_CONDITION_THAT_DOES_NOT_HOLD
                     if (flagB)
                   #endif
                       foo (1);

           The warning is not issued after a "#line" directive, since  this  typically  indicates  autogenerated
           code, and no assumptions can be made about the layout of the file that the directive references.

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b> in C and C++.

       <b>-Wmissing-attributes</b>
           Warn  when  a  declaration of a function is missing one or more attributes that a related function is
           declared with and whose absence may adversely affect the correctness or efficiency of generated code.
           For example, the warning is issued for declarations of aliases that use attributes  to  specify  less
           restrictive  requirements  than  those  of  their  targets.   This  typically  represents a potential
           optimization opportunity.  By contrast, the <b>-Wattribute-alias=2</b> option controls warnings issued  when
           the  alias  is  more  restrictive  than  the  target,  which could lead to incorrect code generation.
           Attributes considered include "alloc_align", "alloc_size", "cold", "const", "hot", "leaf",  "malloc",
           "nonnull", "noreturn", "nothrow", "pure", "returns_nonnull", and "returns_twice".

           In  C++,  the  warning  is issued when an explicit specialization of a primary template declared with
           attribute  "alloc_align",  "alloc_size",  "assume_aligned",  "format",  "format_arg",  "malloc",   or
           "nonnull"  is  declared  without  it.   Attributes  "deprecated", "error", and "warning" suppress the
           warning..

           You can use the "copy" attribute to apply the same set of attributes to  a  declaration  as  that  on
           another  declaration  without explicitly enumerating the attributes. This attribute can be applied to
           declarations of functions, variables, or types.

           <b>-Wmissing-attributes</b> is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

           For example, since the declaration of the primary function template below makes use of both attribute
           "malloc" and "alloc_size" the declaration of the explicit specialization of the template is diagnosed
           because it is missing one of the attributes.

                   template &lt;class T&gt;
                   T* __attribute__ ((malloc, alloc_size (1)))
                   allocate (size_t);

                   template &lt;&gt;
                   void* __attribute__ ((malloc))   // missing alloc_size
                   allocate&lt;void&gt; (size_t);

       <b>-Wmissing-braces</b>
           Warn if an aggregate or union initializer is not fully bracketed.   In  the  following  example,  the
           initializer for "a" is not fully bracketed, but that for "b" is fully bracketed.

                   int a[2][2] = { 0, 1, 2, 3 };
                   int b[2][2] = { { 0, 1 }, { 2, 3 } };

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wmissing-include-dirs</b> (C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn if a user-supplied include directory does not exist.

       <b>-Wno-missing-profile</b>
           This  option  controls warnings if feedback profiles are missing when using the <b>-fprofile-use</b> option.
           This option diagnoses those cases where a new function or a new file is added between compiling  with
           <b>-fprofile-generate</b>  and  with  <b>-fprofile-use</b>, without regenerating the profiles.  In these cases, the
           profile feedback data files do not contain any profile  feedback  information  for  the  newly  added
           function  or file respectively.  Also, in the case when profile count data (.gcda) files are removed,
           GCC cannot use any profile feedback information.  In all these cases, warnings are issued  to  inform
           you that a profile generation step is due.  Ignoring the warning can result in poorly optimized code.
           <b>-Wno-missing-profile</b>  can  be  used to disable the warning, but this is not recommended and should be
           done only when non-existent profile data is justified.

       <b>-Wno-mismatched-dealloc</b>
           Warn for calls to deallocation functions  with  pointer  arguments  returned  from  from  allocations
           functions  for  which the former isn't a suitable deallocator.  A pair of functions can be associated
           as matching allocators and deallocators by  use  of  attribute  "malloc".   Unless  disabled  by  the
           <b>-fno-builtin</b>  option the standard functions "calloc", "malloc", "realloc", and "free", as well as the
           corresponding forms of C++ "operator new" and "operator delete" are implicitly associated as matching
           allocators and deallocators.  In the following example "mydealloc" is the  deallocator  for  pointers
           returned from "myalloc".

                   void mydealloc (void*);

                   __attribute__ ((malloc (mydealloc, 1))) void*
                   myalloc (size_t);

                   void f (void)
                   {
                     void *p = myalloc (32);
                     // ...use p...
                     free (p);   // warning: not a matching deallocator for myalloc
                     mydealloc (p);   // ok
                   }

           In  C++,  the  related option <b>-Wmismatched-new-delete</b> diagnoses mismatches involving either "operator
           new" or "operator delete".

           Option <b>-Wmismatched-dealloc</b> is enabled by default.

       <b>-Wmultistatement-macros</b>
           Warn about unsafe multiple statement macros that appear to be guarded  by  a  clause  such  as  "if",
           "else",  "for", "switch", or "while", in which only the first statement is actually guarded after the
           macro is expanded.

           For example:

                   #define DOIT x++; y++
                   if (c)
                     DOIT;

           will increment "y" unconditionally, not just when "c" holds.  The can usually be  fixed  by  wrapping
           the macro in a do-while loop:

                   #define DOIT do { x++; y++; } while (0)
                   if (c)
                     DOIT;

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b> in C and C++.

       <b>-Wparentheses</b>
           Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such as when there is an assignment in a context
           where  a  truth  value  is  expected,  or when operators are nested whose precedence people often get
           confused about.

           Also warn if a comparison like "x&lt;=y&lt;=z" appears; this is equivalent to "(x&lt;=y ? 1 : 0) &lt;= z",  which
           is a different interpretation from that of ordinary mathematical notation.

           Also  warn  for  dangerous  uses  of  the GNU extension to "?:" with omitted middle operand. When the
           condition in the "?": operator is a boolean  expression,  the  omitted  value  is  always  1.   Often
           programmers expect it to be a value computed inside the conditional expression instead.

           For C++ this also warns for some cases of unnecessary parentheses in declarations, which can indicate
           an attempt at a function call instead of a declaration:

                   {
                     // Declares a local variable called mymutex.
                     std::unique_lock&lt;std::mutex&gt; (mymutex);
                     // User meant std::unique_lock&lt;std::mutex&gt; lock (mymutex);
                   }

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wsequence-point</b>
           Warn  about  code  that may have undefined semantics because of violations of sequence point rules in
           the C and C++ standards.

           The C and C++ standards define the order in which expressions in a C/C++  program  are  evaluated  in
           terms  of  <u>sequence</u>  <u>points</u>, which represent a partial ordering between the execution of parts of the
           program: those executed before the sequence point, and those executed after it.   These  occur  after
           the  evaluation  of  a  full  expression  (one  which  is not part of a larger expression), after the
           evaluation of the first operand of a "&amp;&amp;", "||", "? :" or "," (comma) operator, before a function  is
           called  (but  after the evaluation of its arguments and the expression denoting the called function),
           and in certain other places.  Other than as expressed by the  sequence  point  rules,  the  order  of
           evaluation  of  subexpressions  of  an  expression is not specified.  All these rules describe only a
           partial order rather than a total order, since, for example, if two functions are called  within  one
           expression  with  no  sequence point between them, the order in which the functions are called is not
           specified.  However, the standards committee have ruled that function calls do not overlap.

           It is not specified when between sequence points modifications to the values of objects take  effect.
           Programs whose behavior depends on this have undefined behavior; the C and C++ standards specify that
           "Between  the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored value modified at most
           once by the evaluation of an expression.   Furthermore,  the  prior  value  shall  be  read  only  to
           determine  the  value to be stored.".  If a program breaks these rules, the results on any particular
           implementation are entirely unpredictable.

           Examples of code with undefined behavior are "a = a++;", "a[n] = b[n++]" and  "a[i++]  =  i;".   Some
           more complicated cases are not diagnosed by this option, and it may give an occasional false positive
           result,  but  in  general  it  has  been  found fairly effective at detecting this sort of problem in
           programs.

           The C++17 standard will define the order of evaluation of operands in more cases:  in  particular  it
           requires  that  the  right-hand  side of an assignment be evaluated before the left-hand side, so the
           above examples are no longer undefined.  But this option will still warn about them, to  help  people
           avoid writing code that is undefined in C and earlier revisions of C++.

           The  standard  is  worded confusingly, therefore there is some debate over the precise meaning of the
           sequence point rules in subtle cases.  Links to discussions of the problem, including proposed formal
           definitions, may be found on the GCC readings page, at &lt;<b><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html</a></b>&gt;.

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b> for C and C++.

       <b>-Wno-return-local-addr</b>
           Do not warn about returning a pointer (or in C++, a reference) to a variable that goes out  of  scope
           after the function returns.

       <b>-Wreturn-type</b>
           Warn  whenever  a function is defined with a return type that defaults to "int".  Also warn about any
           "return" statement with no return value in a function whose return type is not  "void"  (falling  off
           the end of the function body is considered returning without a value).

           For  C  only,  warn  about a "return" statement with an expression in a function whose return type is
           "void", unless the expression type is also "void".  As a GNU extension, the latter case  is  accepted
           without  a  warning  unless  <b>-Wpedantic</b>  is used.  Attempting to use the return value of a non-"void"
           function other than "main" that flows off the end by reaching the closing curly brace that terminates
           the function is undefined.

           Unlike in C, in C++, flowing off the end of a  non-"void"  function  other  than  "main"  results  in
           undefined behavior even when the value of the function is not used.

           This warning is enabled by default in C++ and by <b>-Wall</b> otherwise.

       <b>-Wno-shift-count-negative</b>
           Controls warnings if a shift count is negative.  This warning is enabled by default.

       <b>-Wno-shift-count-overflow</b>
           Controls  warnings  if  a  shift  count  is greater than or equal to the bit width of the type.  This
           warning is enabled by default.

       <b>-Wshift-negative-value</b>
           Warn if left shifting a negative value.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wextra</b> in C99  (and  newer)  and

       <b>-Wno-shift-overflow</b>
       <b>-Wshift-overflow=</b><u>n</u>
           These options control warnings about left shift overflows.

           <b>-Wshift-overflow=1</b>
               This  is  the  warning level of <b>-Wshift-overflow</b> and is enabled by default in C99 and C++11 modes
               (and newer).  This warning level  does  not  warn  about  left-shifting  1  into  the  sign  bit.
               (However,  in  C,  such  an  overflow  is  still  rejected  in contexts where an integer constant
               expression is required.)  No warning is emitted in C++20 mode (and newer), as signed left  shifts
               always wrap.

           <b>-Wshift-overflow=2</b>
               This  warning  level  also  warns  about left-shifting 1 into the sign bit, unless C++14 mode (or
               newer) is active.

       <b>-Wswitch</b>
           Warn whenever a "switch" statement has an index of enumerated type and lacks a "case" for one or more
           of the named codes of that enumeration.  (The presence of a "default" label prevents  this  warning.)
           "case"  labels  outside the enumeration range also provoke warnings when this option is used (even if
           there is a "default" label).  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wswitch-default</b>
           Warn whenever a "switch" statement does not have a "default" case.

       <b>-Wswitch-enum</b>
           Warn whenever a "switch" statement has an index of enumerated type and lacks a "case" for one or more
           of the named codes of that enumeration.  "case" labels outside the  enumeration  range  also  provoke
           warnings when this option is used.  The only difference between <b>-Wswitch</b> and this option is that this
           option gives a warning about an omitted enumeration code even if there is a "default" label.

       <b>-Wno-switch-bool</b>
           Do  not  warn  when a "switch" statement has an index of boolean type and the case values are outside
           the range of a boolean type.  It is possible to suppress this  warning  by  casting  the  controlling
           expression to a type other than "bool".  For example:

                   switch ((int) (a == 4))
                     {
                     ...

           This warning is enabled by default for C and C++ programs.

       <b>-Wno-switch-outside-range</b>
           This option controls warnings when a "switch" case has a value that is outside of its respective type
           range.  This warning is enabled by default for C and C++ programs.

       <b>-Wno-switch-unreachable</b>
           Do  not warn when a "switch" statement contains statements between the controlling expression and the
           first case label, which will never be executed.  For example:

                   switch (cond)
                     {
                      i = 15;

                     }

           <b>-Wswitch-unreachable</b> does not warn if the statement between the controlling expression and the  first

       <b>-Wsync-nand</b> (C and C++ only)
           Warn  when  "__sync_fetch_and_nand"  and  "__sync_nand_and_fetch" built-in functions are used.  These
           functions changed semantics in GCC 4.4.

       <b>-Wunused-but-set-parameter</b>
           Warn whenever a function parameter is assigned to, but otherwise unused (aside from its declaration).

           To suppress this warning use the "unused" attribute.

           This warning is also enabled by <b>-Wunused</b> together with <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-Wunused-but-set-variable</b>
           Warn whenever a local variable is assigned to, but otherwise unused  (aside  from  its  declaration).
           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

           To suppress this warning use the "unused" attribute.

           This warning is also enabled by <b>-Wunused</b>, which is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wunused-function</b>
           Warn  whenever  a  static  function  is  declared  but not defined or a non-inline static function is
           unused.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wunused-label</b>
           Warn whenever a label is declared but not used.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

           To suppress this warning use the "unused" attribute.

       <b>-Wunused-local-typedefs</b> (C, Objective-C, C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn when a typedef locally defined in a function is not used.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wunused-parameter</b>
           Warn whenever a function parameter is unused aside from its declaration.

           To suppress this warning use the "unused" attribute.

       <b>-Wno-unused-result</b>
           Do not warn if a caller of a function marked with attribute "warn_unused_result"  does  not  use  its
           return value. The default is <b>-Wunused-result</b>.

       <b>-Wunused-variable</b>
           Warn  whenever  a  local or static variable is unused aside from its declaration. This option implies
           <b>-Wunused-const-variable=1</b> for C, but not for C++. This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

           To suppress this warning use the "unused" attribute.

       <b>-Wunused-const-variable</b>
       <b>-Wunused-const-variable=</b><u>n</u>
           Warn   whenever   a   constant   static   variable   is   unused   aside   from   its    declaration.
           <b>-Wunused-const-variable=1</b>  is enabled by <b>-Wunused-variable</b> for C, but not for C++. In C this declares
           variable storage, but in C++ this is not an error since const variables take the place of "#define"s.

           To suppress this warning use the "unused" attribute.

           <b>-Wunused-const-variable=1</b>
               This is the warning level that is enabled by <b>-Wunused-variable</b> for C.  It warns only about unused
               static const variables defined in the main compilation unit, but not about static const variables
               declared in any header included.

           <b>-Wunused-const-variable=2</b>
               This warning level also warns for unused constant static variables in headers  (excluding  system
               headers).   This is the warning level of <b>-Wunused-const-variable</b> and must be explicitly requested
               since in C++ this isn't an error and in C it might be harder to clean up all headers included.

       <b>-Wunused-value</b>
           Warn whenever a statement computes a result that is explicitly not used.  To  suppress  this  warning
           cast  the unused expression to "void". This includes an expression-statement or the left-hand side of
           a comma expression that contains no side effects. For example, an expression such as "x[i,j]"  causes
           a warning, while "x[(void)i,j]" does not.

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wunused</b>
           All the above <b>-Wunused</b> options combined.

           In  order  to  get  a  warning  about  an  unused function parameter, you must either specify <b>-Wextra</b>
           <b>-Wunused</b> (note that <b>-Wall</b> implies <b>-Wunused</b>), or separately specify <b>-Wunused-parameter</b>.

       <b>-Wuninitialized</b>
           Warn if an object  with  automatic  or  allocated  storage  duration  is  used  without  having  been
           initialized.   In  C++, also warn if a non-static reference or non-static "const" member appears in a
           class without constructors.

           In addition,  passing  a  pointer  (or  in  C++,  a  reference)  to  an  uninitialized  object  to  a
           "const"-qualified  argument of a built-in function known to read the object is also diagnosed by this
           warning.  (<b>-Wmaybe-uninitialized</b> is issued for ordinary functions.)

           If you want to warn about code that  uses  the  uninitialized  value  of  the  variable  in  its  own
           initializer, use the <b>-Winit-self</b> option.

           These  warnings occur for individual uninitialized elements of structure, union or array variables as
           well as for variables that are uninitialized as a whole.  They do not occur for variables or elements
           declared "volatile".  Because these warnings depend on optimization, the exact variables or  elements
           for which there are warnings depend on the precise optimization options and version of GCC used.

           Note  that  there may be no warning about a variable that is used only to compute a value that itself
           is never used, because such computations may be deleted by data flow analysis before the warnings are
           printed.

       <b>-Wno-invalid-memory-model</b>
           This option controls warnings for invocations of <b>__atomic</b> <b>Builtins</b>,  <b>__sync</b>  <b>Builtins</b>,  and  the  C11
           atomic  generic functions with a memory consistency argument that is either invalid for the operation
           or outside  the  range  of  values  of  the  "memory_order"  enumeration.   For  example,  since  the
           "__atomic_store"  and  "__atomic_store_n"  built-ins  are  only defined for the relaxed, release, and
           sequentially consistent memory orders the following code is diagnosed:

                   void store (int *i)
                   {
                     __atomic_store_n (i, 0, memory_order_consume);
                   }

           <b>-Winvalid-memory-model</b> is enabled by default.

       <b>-Wmaybe-uninitialized</b>
           For an object with automatic or allocated storage duration, if there exists a path from the  function
           entry  to  a  use  of  the object that is initialized, but there exist some other paths for which the
           object is not initialized, the compiler emits a warning if it cannot prove  the  uninitialized  paths
           are not executed at run time.

           In  addition,  passing  a  pointer  (or  in  C++,  a  reference)  to  an  uninitialized  object  to a
           "const"-qualified function argument is also diagnosed by this warning.   (<b>-Wuninitialized</b>  is  issued
           for  built-in  functions  known  to read the object.)  Annotating the function with attribute "access
           (none)" indicates that the argument isn't used to access the object and avoids the warning.

           These warnings are only possible in optimizing compilation, because otherwise GCC does not keep track
           of the state of variables.

           These warnings are made optional because GCC may not be able to determine when the code is correct in
           spite of appearing to have an error.  Here is one example of how this can happen:

                   {
                     int x;
                     switch (y)
                       {
                       case 1: x = 1;
                         break;
                       case 2: x = 4;
                         break;
                       case 3: x = 5;
                       }
                     foo (x);
                   }

           If the value of "y" is always 1, 2 or 3, then "x" is always initialized, but GCC doesn't  know  this.
           To suppress the warning, you need to provide a default case with <b><a href="../man0/assert.0.html">assert</a></b>(0) or similar code.

           This  option  also  warns  when  a  non-volatile  automatic  variable  might  be changed by a call to
           "longjmp".  The compiler sees only the calls to "setjmp".  It cannot know  where  "longjmp"  will  be
           called; in fact, a signal handler could call it at any point in the code.  As a result, you may get a
           warning even when there is in fact no problem because "longjmp" cannot in fact be called at the place
           that would cause a problem.

           Some  spurious  warnings can be avoided if you declare all the functions you use that never return as
           "noreturn".

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b> or <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-Wunknown-pragmas</b>
           Warn when a "#pragma" directive is encountered that is not understood by GCC.  If  this  command-line
           option is used, warnings are even issued for unknown pragmas in system header files.  This is not the
           case if the warnings are only enabled by the <b>-Wall</b> command-line option.

       <b>-Wno-pragmas</b>
           Do  not  warn  about  misuses  of pragmas, such as incorrect parameters, invalid syntax, or conflicts
           between pragmas.  See also <b>-Wunknown-pragmas</b>.

       <b>-Wno-prio-ctor-dtor</b>
           Do not warn if a priority from 0  to  100  is  used  for  constructor  or  destructor.   The  use  of
           constructor and destructor attributes allow you to assign a priority to the constructor/destructor to
           control its order of execution before "main" is called or after it returns.  The priority values must
           be greater than 100 as the compiler reserves priority values between 0--100 for the implementation.

       <b>-Wstrict-aliasing</b>
           This  option  is  only active when <b>-fstrict-aliasing</b> is active.  It warns about code that might break
           the strict aliasing rules that the compiler is using for optimization.  The warning  does  not  catch
           all  cases,  but  does  attempt  to  catch the more common pitfalls.  It is included in <b>-Wall</b>.  It is
           equivalent to <b>-Wstrict-aliasing=3</b>

       <b>-Wstrict-aliasing=n</b>
           This option is only active when <b>-fstrict-aliasing</b> is active.  It warns about code  that  might  break
           the  strict  aliasing rules that the compiler is using for optimization.  Higher levels correspond to
           higher accuracy (fewer false positives).  Higher levels also correspond to more  effort,  similar  to
           the way <b>-O</b> works.  <b>-Wstrict-aliasing</b> is equivalent to <b>-Wstrict-aliasing=3</b>.

           Level  1: Most aggressive, quick, least accurate.  Possibly useful when higher levels do not warn but
           <b>-fstrict-aliasing</b> still breaks the code, as it has very few false negatives.  However,  it  has  many
           false  positives.   Warns  for  all  pointer conversions between possibly incompatible types, even if
           never dereferenced.  Runs in the front end only.

           Level 2: Aggressive, quick, not too precise.  May still have many false positives  (not  as  many  as
           level  1  though), and few false negatives (but possibly more than level 1).  Unlike level 1, it only
           warns when an address is taken.  Warns about incomplete types.  Runs in the front end only.

           Level 3 (default for  <b>-Wstrict-aliasing</b>):  Should  have  very  few  false  positives  and  few  false
           negatives.   Slightly  slower  than  levels  1  or 2 when optimization is enabled.  Takes care of the
           common pun+dereference pattern in the front end: "*(int*)&amp;some_float".  If optimization  is  enabled,
           it  also  runs  in  the  back  end, where it deals with multiple statement cases using flow-sensitive
           points-to information.  Only warns when the converted pointer is dereferenced.  Does not  warn  about
           incomplete types.

       <b>-Wstrict-overflow</b>
       <b>-Wstrict-overflow=</b><u>n</u>
           This  option  is  only  active  when  signed  overflow  is undefined.  It warns about cases where the
           compiler optimizes based on the assumption that signed overflow does not occur.  Note  that  it  does
           not  warn about all cases where the code might overflow: it only warns about cases where the compiler
           implements some optimization.  Thus this warning depends on the optimization level.

           An optimization that assumes that signed overflow does not occur is perfectly safe if the  values  of
           the variables involved are such that overflow never does, in fact, occur.  Therefore this warning can
           easily  give a false positive: a warning about code that is not actually a problem.  To help focus on
           important issues, several warning levels are  defined.   No  warnings  are  issued  for  the  use  of
           undefined  signed  overflow  when  estimating how many iterations a loop requires, in particular when
           determining whether a loop will be executed at all.

           <b>-Wstrict-overflow=1</b>
               Warn about cases that are both  questionable  and  easy  to  avoid.   For  example  the  compiler
               simplifies  "x + 1 &gt; x" to 1.  This level of <b>-Wstrict-overflow</b> is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>; higher levels
               are not, and must be explicitly requested.

           <b>-Wstrict-overflow=2</b>
               Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified to a constant.   For  example:  "abs
               (x)  &gt;=  0".  This can only be simplified when signed integer overflow is undefined, because "abs
               (INT_MIN)" overflows to "INT_MIN", which is less than zero.  <b>-Wstrict-overflow</b> (with no level) is
               the same as <b>-Wstrict-overflow=2</b>.

           <b>-Wstrict-overflow=3</b>
               Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified.  For  example:  "x  +  1  &gt;  1"  is
               simplified to "x &gt; 0".

           <b>-Wstrict-overflow=4</b>
               Also  warn  about other simplifications not covered by the above cases.  For example: "(x * 10) /
               5" is simplified to "x * 2".

           <b>-Wstrict-overflow=5</b>
               Also warn about cases where the compiler reduces the  magnitude  of  a  constant  involved  in  a
               comparison.   For  example:  "x + 2 &gt; y" is simplified to "x + 1 &gt;= y".  This is reported only at
               the highest warning level because this  simplification  applies  to  many  comparisons,  so  this
               warning level gives a very large number of false positives.

       <b>-Wstring-compare</b>
           Warn  for calls to "strcmp" and "strncmp" whose result is determined to be either zero or non-zero in
           tests for such equality owing to the length of one argument being greater than the size of the  array
           the  other  argument  is  stored  in  (or  the  bound in the case of "strncmp").  Such calls could be
           mistakes.  For example, the call to "strcmp" below is diagnosed because  its  result  is  necessarily
           non-zero irrespective of the contents of the array "a".

                   extern char a[4];
                   void f (char *d)
                   {
                     strcpy (d, "string");
                     ...
                     if (0 == strcmp (a, d))   // cannot be true
                       puts ("a and d are the same");
                   }

           <b>-Wstring-compare</b> is enabled by <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-Wno-stringop-overflow</b>
       <b>-Wstringop-overflow</b>
       <b>-Wstringop-overflow=</b><u>type</u>
           Warn  for calls to string manipulation functions such as "memcpy" and "strcpy" that are determined to
           overflow the destination buffer.  The optional argument is one greater than the type of  Object  Size
           Checking  to  perform  to determine the size of the destination.  The argument is meaningful only for
           functions that operate on character arrays but not for  raw  memory  functions  like  "memcpy"  which
           always make use of Object Size type-0.  The option also warns for calls that specify a size in excess
           of the largest possible object or at most "SIZE_MAX / 2" bytes.  The option produces the best results
           with  optimization  enabled  but  can  detect  a small subset of simple buffer overflows even without
           optimization in calls to the GCC built-in functions like "__builtin_memcpy" that  correspond  to  the
           standard  functions.   In any case, the option warns about just a subset of buffer overflows detected
           by the corresponding overflow checking built-ins.  For example, the option issues a warning  for  the
           "strcpy"  call  below  because  it  copies  at  least  5  characters (the string "blue" including the
           terminating NUL) into the buffer of size 4.

                   enum Color { blue, purple, yellow };
                   const char* f (enum Color clr)
                   {
                     static char buf [4];
                     const char *str;
                     switch (clr)
                       {
                         case blue: str = "blue"; break;
                         case purple: str = "purple"; break;
                         case yellow: str = "yellow"; break;
                       }

                     return strcpy (buf, str);   // warning here
                   }

           Option <b>-Wstringop-overflow=2</b> is enabled by default.

           <b>-Wstringop-overflow</b>
           <b>-Wstringop-overflow=1</b>
               The <b>-Wstringop-overflow=1</b> option uses type-zero Object Size Checking to determine  the  sizes  of
               destination  objects.   At  this  setting  the  option  does  not warn for writes past the end of
               subobjects of larger objects accessed by pointers unless the  size  of  the  largest  surrounding
               object  is  known.   When  the  destination may be one of several objects it is assumed to be the
               largest one of them.  On Linux systems, when optimization is enabled at this setting  the  option
               warns for the same code as when the "_FORTIFY_SOURCE" macro is defined to a non-zero value.

           <b>-Wstringop-overflow=2</b>
               The  <b>-Wstringop-overflow=2</b>  option  uses  type-one Object Size Checking to determine the sizes of
               destination objects.  At this setting the option warns about overflows when writing to members of
               the largest complete objects whose exact size is known.  However, it does not warn for  excessive
               writes  to  the  same  members  of unknown objects referenced by pointers since they may point to
               arrays containing unknown numbers of elements.  This is the default setting of the option.

           <b>-Wstringop-overflow=3</b>
               The <b>-Wstringop-overflow=3</b> option uses type-two Object Size Checking to  determine  the  sizes  of
               destination  objects.   At this setting the option warns about overflowing the smallest object or
               data member.  This is the most restrictive setting of the option that may result in warnings  for
               safe code.

           <b>-Wstringop-overflow=4</b>
               The  <b>-Wstringop-overflow=4</b>  option uses type-three Object Size Checking to determine the sizes of
               destination objects.  At this setting the option warns about overflowing any  data  members,  and
               when  the destination is one of several objects it uses the size of the largest of them to decide
               whether to issue a warning.  Similarly to <b>-Wstringop-overflow=3</b> this setting of  the  option  may
               result in warnings for benign code.

       <b>-Wno-stringop-overread</b>
           Warn  for calls to string manipulation functions such as "memchr", or "strcpy" that are determined to
           read past the end of the source sequence.

           Option <b>-Wstringop-overread</b> is enabled by default.

       <b>-Wno-stringop-truncation</b>
           Do not warn for calls to bounded string manipulation functions  such  as  "strncat",  "strncpy",  and
           "stpncpy" that may either truncate the copied string or leave the destination unchanged.

           In the following example, the call to "strncat" specifies a bound that is less than the length of the
           source  string.   As a result, the copy of the source will be truncated and so the call is diagnosed.
           To avoid the warning use "bufsize - strlen (buf) - 1)" as the bound.

                   void append (char *buf, size_t bufsize)
                   {
                     strncat (buf, ".txt", 3);
                   }

           As another example, the following call to "strncpy" results in copying to  "d"  just  the  characters
           preceding  the  terminating  NUL,  without  appending  the  NUL  to  the end.  Assuming the result of
           "strncpy" is necessarily a NUL-terminated string is a common mistake, and so the call  is  diagnosed.
           To avoid the warning when the result is not expected to be NUL-terminated, call "memcpy" instead.

                   void copy (char *d, const char *s)
                   {
                     strncpy (d, s, strlen (s));
                   }

           In  the  following example, the call to "strncpy" specifies the size of the destination buffer as the
           bound.  If the length of the source string is equal to or greater than this size the  result  of  the
           copy  will  not  be  NUL-terminated.   Therefore,  the call is also diagnosed.  To avoid the warning,
           specify "sizeof buf - 1" as the bound and set the last element of the buffer to "NUL".

                   void copy (const char *s)
                   {
                     char buf[80];
                     strncpy (buf, s, sizeof buf);
                     ...
                   }

           In situations where a character array is intended to store a sequence of bytes  with  no  terminating
           "NUL"  such an array may be annotated with attribute "nonstring" to avoid this warning.  Such arrays,
           however, are not suitable arguments to functions  that  expect  "NUL"-terminated  strings.   To  help
           detect  accidental  misuses  of  such  arrays GCC issues warnings unless it can prove that the use is
           safe.

       <b>-Wsuggest-attribute=</b>[<b>pure</b>|<b>const</b>|<b>noreturn</b>|<b>format</b>|<b>cold</b>|<b>malloc</b>]
           Warn for cases where adding an attribute may be beneficial. The attributes  currently  supported  are
           listed below.

           <b>-Wsuggest-attribute=pure</b>
           <b>-Wsuggest-attribute=const</b>
           <b>-Wsuggest-attribute=noreturn</b>
           <b>-Wmissing-noreturn</b>
           <b>-Wsuggest-attribute=malloc</b>
               Warn  about  functions  that  might be candidates for attributes "pure", "const" or "noreturn" or
               "malloc". The compiler only warns for functions visible in other compilation  units  or  (in  the
               case  of  "pure"  and  "const") if it cannot prove that the function returns normally. A function
               returns normally if it doesn't contain an infinite loop or return abnormally by throwing, calling
               "abort" or trapping.  This analysis requires option <b>-fipa-pure-const</b>, which is enabled by default
               at <b>-O</b> and higher.  Higher optimization levels improve the accuracy of the analysis.

           <b>-Wsuggest-attribute=format</b>
           <b>-Wmissing-format-attribute</b>
               Warn about function pointers that might be candidates for "format" attributes.   Note  these  are
               only  possible  candidates,  not absolute ones.  GCC guesses that function pointers with "format"
               attributes that are used in assignment, initialization, parameter passing  or  return  statements
               should have a corresponding "format" attribute in the resulting type.  I.e. the left-hand side of
               the  assignment  or initialization, the type of the parameter variable, or the return type of the
               containing function respectively should also have a "format" attribute to avoid the warning.

               GCC also warns about function definitions that  might  be  candidates  for  "format"  attributes.
               Again,  these  are  only  possible  candidates.   GCC  guesses  that "format" attributes might be
               appropriate for any function that calls a function like "vprintf" or "vscanf", but this might not
               always be the case, and some functions for which "format" attributes are appropriate may  not  be
               detected.

           <b>-Wsuggest-attribute=cold</b>
               Warn  about  functions  that  might  be candidates for "cold" attribute.  This is based on static
               detection and generally only warns about functions which always leads to a call to another "cold"
               function such as wrappers of C++ "throw" or fatal error reporting functions leading to "abort".

       <b>-Walloc-zero</b>
           Warn about calls to allocation functions decorated with  attribute  "alloc_size"  that  specify  zero
           bytes,  including  those  to the built-in forms of the functions "aligned_alloc", "alloca", "calloc",
           "malloc", and "realloc".  Because the behavior of these  functions  when  called  with  a  zero  size
           differs  among  implementations  (and in the case of "realloc" has been deprecated) relying on it may
           result in subtle portability bugs and should be avoided.

       <b>-Walloc-size-larger-than=</b><u>byte-size</u>
           Warn about calls to functions decorated with attribute "alloc_size" that attempt to allocate  objects
           larger  than the specified number of bytes, or where the result of the size computation in an integer
           type  with  infinite  precision  would   exceed   the   value   of   <b>PTRDIFF_MAX</b>   on   the   target.
           <b>-Walloc-size-larger-than=PTRDIFF_MAX</b> is enabled by default.  Warnings controlled by the option can be
           disabled either by specifying <u>byte-size</u> of <b>SIZE_MAX</b> or more or by <b>-Wno-alloc-size-larger-than</b>.

       <b>-Wno-alloc-size-larger-than</b>
           Disable      <b>-Walloc-size-larger-than=</b>     warnings.      The     option     is     equivalent     to
           <b>-Walloc-size-larger-than=SIZE_MAX</b> or larger.

       <b>-Walloca</b>
           This option warns on all uses of "alloca" in the source.

       <b>-Walloca-larger-than=</b><u>byte-size</u>
           This option warns on calls to "alloca" with an integer argument whose value is either zero,  or  that
           is  not bounded by a controlling predicate that limits its value to at most <u>byte-size</u>.  It also warns
           for calls to "alloca" where  the  bound  value  is  unknown.   Arguments  of  non-integer  types  are
           considered unbounded even if they appear to be constrained to the expected range.

           For example, a bounded case of "alloca" could be:

                   void func (size_t n)
                   {
                     void *p;
                     if (n &lt;= 1000)
                       p = alloca (n);
                     else
                       p = malloc (n);
                     f (p);
                   }

           In  the above example, passing "-Walloca-larger-than=1000" would not issue a warning because the call
           to "alloca" is known to be at most 1000 bytes.  However, if "-Walloca-larger-than=500"  were  passed,
           the compiler would emit a warning.

           Unbounded  uses,  on  the other hand, are uses of "alloca" with no controlling predicate constraining
           its integer argument.  For example:

                   void func ()
                   {
                     void *p = alloca (n);
                     f (p);
                   }

           If "-Walloca-larger-than=500" were passed, the above would trigger a warning, but this  time  because
           of the lack of bounds checking.

           Note, that even seemingly correct code involving signed integers could cause a warning:

                   void func (signed int n)
                   {
                     if (n &lt; 500)
                       {
                         p = alloca (n);
                         f (p);
                       }
                   }

           In  the  above example, <u>n</u> could be negative, causing a larger than expected argument to be implicitly
           cast into the "alloca" call.

           This option also warns when "alloca" is used in a loop.

           <b>-Walloca-larger-than=PTRDIFF_MAX</b> is enabled by default but is usually only effective  when <b>-ftree-vrp</b>
           is active (default for <b>-O2</b> and above).

           See also <b>-Wvla-larger-than=byte-size</b>.

       <b>-Wno-alloca-larger-than</b>
           Disable <b>-Walloca-larger-than=</b> warnings.  The option is equivalent to <b>-Walloca-larger-than=SIZE_MAX</b> or
           larger.

       <b>-Warith-conversion</b>
           Do warn about implicit conversions from arithmetic operations even when conversion of the operands to
           the  same  type  cannot  change   their   values.    This   affects   warnings   from   <b>-Wconversion</b>,
           <b>-Wfloat-conversion</b>, and <b>-Wsign-conversion</b>.

                   void f (char c, int i)
                   {
                     c = c + i; // warns with B&lt;-Wconversion&gt;
                     c = c + 1; // only warns with B&lt;-Warith-conversion&gt;
                   }

       <b>-Warray-bounds</b>
       <b>-Warray-bounds=</b><u>n</u>
           This  option  is  only  active  when <b>-ftree-vrp</b> is active (default for <b>-O2</b> and above). It warns about
           subscripts to arrays that are always out of bounds. This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

           <b>-Warray-bounds=1</b>
               This is the warning level of <b>-Warray-bounds</b> and is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>; higher levels are  not,  and
               must be explicitly requested.

           <b>-Warray-bounds=2</b>
               This  warning  level  also warns about out of bounds access for arrays at the end of a struct and
               for arrays accessed through pointers. This warning level  may  give  a  larger  number  of  false
               positives and is deactivated by default.

       <b>-Warray-parameter</b>
       <b>-Warray-parameter=</b><u>n</u>
           Warn  about redeclarations of functions involving arguments of array or pointer types of inconsistent
           kinds or forms, and enable the detection of out-of-bounds accesses to  such  parameters  by  warnings
           such as <b>-Warray-bounds</b>.

           If  the first function declaration uses the array form the bound specified in the array is assumed to
           be the minimum number of elements expected to be provided in calls to the function  and  the  maximum
           number of elements accessed by it.  Failing to provide arguments of sufficient size or accessing more
           than  the maximum number of elements may be diagnosed by warnings such as <b>-Warray-bounds</b>.  At level 1
           the warning diagnoses inconsistencies involving array parameters declared  using  the  "T[static  N]"
           form.

           For  example,  the  warning triggers for the following redeclarations because the first one allows an
           array of any size to be passed to "f" while the second one with the keyword "static"  specifies  that
           the array argument must have at least four elements.

                   void f (int[static 4]);
                   void f (int[]);           // warning (inconsistent array form)

                   void g (void)
                   {
                     int *p = (int *)malloc (4);
                     f (p);                  // warning (array too small)
                     ...
                   }

           At level 2 the warning also triggers for redeclarations involving any other inconsistency in array or
           pointer argument forms denoting array sizes.  Pointers and arrays of unspecified bound are considered
           equivalent and do not trigger a warning.

                   void g (int*);
                   void g (int[]);     // no warning
                   void g (int[8]);    // warning (inconsistent array bound)

           <b>-Warray-parameter=2</b>  is  included in <b>-Wall</b>.  The <b>-Wvla-parameter</b> option triggers warnings for similar
           inconsistencies involving Variable Length Array arguments.

       <b>-Wattribute-alias=</b><u>n</u>
       <b>-Wno-attribute-alias</b>
           Warn about declarations using the "alias" and similar attributes whose target  is  incompatible  with
           the type of the alias.

           <b>-Wattribute-alias=1</b>
               The default warning level of the <b>-Wattribute-alias</b> option diagnoses incompatibilities between the
               type  of  the  alias  declaration  and  that of its target.  Such incompatibilities are typically
               indicative of bugs.

           <b>-Wattribute-alias=2</b>
               At this  level  <b>-Wattribute-alias</b>  also  diagnoses  cases  where  the  attributes  of  the  alias
               declaration are more restrictive than the attributes applied to its target.  These mismatches can
               potentially  result in incorrect code generation.  In other cases they may be benign and could be
               resolved simply by adding  the  missing  attribute  to  the  target.   For  comparison,  see  the
               <b>-Wmissing-attributes</b>  option,  which  controls  diagnostics  when  the  alias declaration is less
               restrictive than the target, rather than more restrictive.

               Attributes considered  include  "alloc_align",  "alloc_size",  "cold",  "const",  "hot",  "leaf",
               "malloc", "nonnull", "noreturn", "nothrow", "pure", "returns_nonnull", and "returns_twice".

           <b>-Wattribute-alias</b>  is equivalent to <b>-Wattribute-alias=1</b>.  This is the default.  You can disable these
           warnings with either <b>-Wno-attribute-alias</b> or <b>-Wattribute-alias=0</b>.

       <b>-Wbool-compare</b>
           Warn about boolean expression compared with an integer  value  different  from  "true"/"false".   For
           instance, the following comparison is always false:

                   int n = 5;
                   ...
                   if ((n &gt; 1) == 2) { ... }

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wbool-operation</b>
           Warn about suspicious operations on expressions of a boolean type.  For instance, bitwise negation of
           a  boolean is very likely a bug in the program.  For C, this warning also warns about incrementing or
           decrementing a boolean, which rarely makes sense.  (In C++, decrementing a boolean is always invalid.
           Incrementing a boolean is invalid in C++17, and deprecated otherwise.)

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wduplicated-branches</b>
           Warn when an if-else has identical branches.  This warning detects cases like

                   if (p != NULL)
                     return 0;
                   else
                     return 0;

           It doesn't warn when both branches contain just  a  null  statement.   This  warning  also  warn  for
           conditional operators:

                     int i = x ? *p : *p;

       <b>-Wduplicated-cond</b>
           Warn about duplicated conditions in an if-else-if chain.  For instance, warn for the following code:

                   if (p-&gt;q != NULL) { ... }
                   else if (p-&gt;q != NULL) { ... }

       <b>-Wframe-address</b>
           Warn  when the <b>__builtin_frame_address</b> or <b>__builtin_return_address</b> is called with an argument greater
           than 0.  Such calls may return indeterminate values or crash the program.  The warning is included in
           <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wno-discarded-qualifiers</b> (C and Objective-C only)
           Do not warn if type qualifiers on pointers are being discarded.  Typically, the compiler warns  if  a
           "const  char *" variable is passed to a function that takes a "char *" parameter.  This option can be
           used to suppress such a warning.

       <b>-Wno-discarded-array-qualifiers</b> (C and Objective-C only)
           Do not warn if type qualifiers on arrays which are pointer targets are being  discarded.   Typically,
           the  compiler  warns if a "const int (*)[]" variable is passed to a function that takes a "int (*)[]"
           parameter.  This option can be used to suppress such a warning.

       <b>-Wno-incompatible-pointer-types</b> (C and Objective-C only)
           Do not warn when there is a conversion between pointers that have incompatible types.   This  warning
           is for cases not covered by <b>-Wno-pointer-sign</b>, which warns for pointer argument passing or assignment
           with different signedness.

       <b>-Wno-int-conversion</b> (C and Objective-C only)
           Do  not  warn about incompatible integer to pointer and pointer to integer conversions.  This warning
           is about implicit conversions; for explicit conversions  the  warnings  <b>-Wno-int-to-pointer-cast</b>  and
           <b>-Wno-pointer-to-int-cast</b> may be used.

       <b>-Wzero-length-bounds</b>
           Warn  about accesses to elements of zero-length array members that might overlap other members of the
           same object.  Declaring interior zero-length arrays is  discouraged  because  accesses  to  them  are
           undefined.  See

           For  example, the first two stores in function "bad" are diagnosed because the array elements overlap
           the subsequent members "b" and "c".  The third store is diagnosed by  <b>-Warray-bounds</b>  because  it  is
           beyond the bounds of the enclosing object.

                   struct X { int a[0]; int b, c; };
                   struct X x;

                   void bad (void)
                   {
                     x.a[0] = 0;   // -Wzero-length-bounds
                     x.a[1] = 1;   // -Wzero-length-bounds
                     x.a[2] = 2;   // -Warray-bounds
                   }

           Option <b>-Wzero-length-bounds</b> is enabled by <b>-Warray-bounds</b>.

       <b>-Wno-div-by-zero</b>
           Do  not  warn  about  compile-time  integer division by zero.  Floating-point division by zero is not
           warned about, as it can be a legitimate way of obtaining infinities and NaNs.

       <b>-Wsystem-headers</b>
           Print warning messages for constructs found in system header files.  Warnings from system headers are
           normally suppressed, on the assumption that they usually do not indicate real problems and would only
           make the compiler output harder to read.  Using this command-line option tells GCC to  emit  warnings
           from  system headers as if they occurred in user code.  However, note that using <b>-Wall</b> in conjunction
           with this option does <u>not</u> warn about unknown pragmas in system headers---for that,  <b>-Wunknown-pragmas</b>
           must also be used.

       <b>-Wtautological-compare</b>
           Warn  if  a self-comparison always evaluates to true or false.  This warning detects various mistakes
           such as:

                   int i = 1;
                   ...
                   if (i &gt; i) { ... }

           This warning also warns about bitwise  comparisons  that  always  evaluate  to  true  or  false,  for
           instance:

                   if ((a &amp; 16) == 10) { ... }

           will always be false.

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wtrampolines</b>
           Warn  about trampolines generated for pointers to nested functions.  A trampoline is a small piece of
           data or code that is created at run time on the stack when the address of a nested function is taken,
           and is used to call the nested function indirectly.  For some targets, it is made up of data only and
           thus requires no special treatment.  But, for most targets, it is made up of code and  thus  requires
           the stack to be made executable in order for the program to work properly.

       <b>-Wfloat-equal</b>
           Warn if floating-point values are used in equality comparisons.

           The  idea  behind  this is that sometimes it is convenient (for the programmer) to consider floating-
           point values as approximations to infinitely precise real numbers.  If you are doing this,  then  you
           need  to  compute  (by  analyzing the code, or in some other way) the maximum or likely maximum error
           that the computation introduces, and allow for it when performing  comparisons  (and  when  producing
           output,  but that's a different problem).  In particular, instead of testing for equality, you should
           check to see whether the two values have ranges that overlap; and this is done  with  the  relational
           operators, so equality comparisons are probably mistaken.

       <b>-Wtraditional</b> (C and Objective-C only)
           Warn  about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and ISO C.  Also warn about ISO
           C constructs that have no traditional C equivalent, and/or  problematic  constructs  that  should  be
           avoided.

           *   Macro  parameters  that  appear within string literals in the macro body.  In traditional C macro
               replacement takes place within string literals, but in ISO C it does not.

           *   In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not  exist.   Traditional  preprocessors  only
               considered  a  line  to  be  a  directive  if  the <b>#</b> appeared in column 1 on the line.  Therefore
               <b>-Wtraditional</b> warns about directives that traditional C understands but  ignores  because  the  <b>#</b>
               does  not  appear  as the first character on the line.  It also suggests you hide directives like
               "#pragma" not understood by traditional C by indenting them.  Some traditional implementations do
               not recognize "#elif", so this option suggests avoiding it altogether.

           *   A function-like macro that appears without arguments.

           *   The unary plus operator.

           *   The <b>U</b> integer constant suffix, or the <b>F</b> or <b>L</b> floating-point constant  suffixes.   (Traditional  C
               does  support  the <b>L</b> suffix on integer constants.)  Note, these suffixes appear in macros defined
               in the system headers of most modern systems, e.g. the <b>_MIN</b>/<b>_MAX</b> macros in "&lt;limits.h&gt;".  Use  of
               these  macros  in  user  code  might normally lead to spurious warnings, however GCC's integrated
               preprocessor has enough context to avoid warning in these cases.

           *   A function declared external in one block and then used after the end of the block.

           *   A "switch" statement has an operand of type "long".

           *   A non-"static" function declaration follows a "static" one.  This construct is  not  accepted  by
               some traditional C compilers.

           *   The  ISO  type  of  an  integer constant has a different width or signedness from its traditional
               type.  This warning is only issued if the base of the constant is ten.  I.e. hexadecimal or octal
               values, which typically represent bit patterns, are not warned about.

           *   Usage of ISO string concatenation is detected.

           *   Initialization of automatic aggregates.

           *   Identifier conflicts with labels.  Traditional C lacks a separate namespace for labels.

           *   Initialization of unions.  If the initializer is zero, the warning  is  omitted.   This  is  done
               under  the  assumption  that  the  zero  initializer  in  user  code  appears conditioned on e.g.
               "__STDC__" to avoid missing initializer warnings and relies on default initialization to zero  in
               the traditional C case.

           *   Conversions  by  prototypes  between  fixed/floating-point values and vice versa.  The absence of
               these prototypes when compiling with traditional C causes serious problems.  This is a subset  of
               the possible conversion warnings; for the full set use <b>-Wtraditional-conversion</b>.

           *   Use  of ISO C style function definitions.  This warning intentionally is <u>not</u> issued for prototype
               declarations or variadic functions because these ISO C features appear in your  code  when  using
               libiberty's  traditional  C  compatibility  macros, "PARAMS" and "VPARAMS".  This warning is also
               bypassed for nested functions because that feature is  already  a  GCC  extension  and  thus  not
               relevant to traditional C compatibility.

       <b>-Wtraditional-conversion</b> (C and Objective-C only)
           Warn  if  a  prototype  causes a type conversion that is different from what would happen to the same
           argument in the absence of a prototype.  This includes conversions of fixed  point  to  floating  and
           vice  versa,  and  conversions changing the width or signedness of a fixed-point argument except when
           the same as the default promotion.

       <b>-Wdeclaration-after-statement</b> (C and Objective-C only)
           Warn when a declaration is found after a statement in a block.  This construct, known from  C++,  was
           introduced with ISO C99 and is by default allowed in GCC.  It is not supported by ISO C90.

       <b>-Wshadow</b>
           Warn  whenever  a local variable or type declaration shadows another variable, parameter, type, class
           member (in C++), or instance variable (in Objective-C) or whenever a built-in function  is  shadowed.
           Note  that  in C++, the compiler warns if a local variable shadows an explicit typedef, but not if it
           shadows a struct/class/enum.  If this warning is enabled, it includes also  all  instances  of  local
           shadowing.   This  means  that  <b>-Wno-shadow=local</b>  and  <b>-Wno-shadow=compatible-local</b> are ignored when
           <b>-Wshadow</b> is used.  Same as <b>-Wshadow=global</b>.

       <b>-Wno-shadow-ivar</b> (Objective-C only)
           Do not warn whenever a local variable shadows an instance variable in an Objective-C method.

       <b>-Wshadow=global</b>
           Warn for any shadowing.  Same as <b>-Wshadow</b>.

       <b>-Wshadow=local</b>
           Warn when a local variable shadows another local variable or parameter.

       <b>-Wshadow=compatible-local</b>
           Warn when a local variable shadows another local variable or parameter whose type is compatible  with
           that  of  the  shadowing  variable.   In C++, type compatibility here means the type of the shadowing
           variable can be converted to that of the shadowed variable.  The creation of this flag  (in  addition
           to  <b>-Wshadow=local</b>)  is  based  on  the  idea  that  when  a  local  variable  shadows another one of
           incompatible type, it is most likely intentional, not a bug  or  typo,  as  shown  in  the  following
           example:

                   for (SomeIterator i = SomeObj.begin(); i != SomeObj.end(); ++i)
                   {
                     for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; ++i)
                     {
                       ...
                     }
                     ...
                   }

           Since   the   two  variable  "i"  in  the  example  above  have  incompatible  types,  enabling  only
           <b>-Wshadow=compatible-local</b> does not emit a warning.   Because  their  types  are  incompatible,  if  a
           programmer  accidentally  uses one in place of the other, type checking is expected to catch that and
           emit an error or warning.  Use of this flag instead of <b>-Wshadow=local</b> can possibly reduce the  number
           of warnings triggered by intentional shadowing.  Note that this also means that shadowing "const char
           *i" by "char *i" does not emit a warning.

           This warning is also enabled by <b>-Wshadow=local</b>.

       <b>-Wlarger-than=</b><u>byte-size</u>
           Warn  whenever  an  object  is  defined  whose  size exceeds <u>byte-size</u>.  <b>-Wlarger-than=PTRDIFF_MAX</b> is
           enabled by default.  Warnings controlled by the option can be disabled either by specifying <u>byte-size</u>
           of <b>SIZE_MAX</b> or more or by <b>-Wno-larger-than</b>.

           Also warn for calls to bounded functions such as "memchr" or "strnlen" that specify a  bound  greater
           than  the largest possible object, which is <b>PTRDIFF_MAX</b> bytes by default.  These warnings can only be
           disabled by <b>-Wno-larger-than</b>.

       <b>-Wno-larger-than</b>
           Disable <b>-Wlarger-than=</b> warnings.  The option is equivalent to <b>-Wlarger-than=SIZE_MAX</b> or larger.

       <b>-Wframe-larger-than=</b><u>byte-size</u>
           Warn if the size of a function frame exceeds <u>byte-size</u>.  The computation done to determine the  stack
           frame size is approximate and not conservative.  The actual requirements may be somewhat greater than
           <u>byte-size</u> even if you do not get a warning.  In addition, any space allocated via "alloca", variable-
           length  arrays, or related constructs is not included by the compiler when determining whether or not
           to issue a warning.  <b>-Wframe-larger-than=PTRDIFF_MAX</b> is enabled by default.  Warnings  controlled  by
           the   option   can   be   disabled  either  by  specifying  <u>byte-size</u>  of  <b>SIZE_MAX</b>  or  more  or  by
           <b>-Wno-frame-larger-than</b>.

       <b>-Wno-frame-larger-than</b>
           Disable <b>-Wframe-larger-than=</b> warnings.  The option is equivalent to  <b>-Wframe-larger-than=SIZE_MAX</b>  or
           larger.

       <b>-Wno-free-nonheap-object</b>
           Warn when attempting to deallocate an object that was either not allocated on the heap, or by using a
           pointer  that  was  not  returned  from  a  prior call to the corresponding allocation function.  For
           example, because the call to "stpcpy" returns a pointer to the terminating nul character and  not  to
           the begginning of the object, the call to "free" below is diagnosed.

                   void f (char *p)
                   {
                     p = stpcpy (p, "abc");
                     // ...
                     free (p);   // warning
                   }

           <b>-Wfree-nonheap-object</b> is enabled by default.

       <b>-Wstack-usage=</b><u>byte-size</u>
           Warn  if the stack usage of a function might exceed <u>byte-size</u>.  The computation done to determine the
           stack usage is conservative.  Any space allocated via "alloca", variable-length  arrays,  or  related
           constructs is included by the compiler when determining whether or not to issue a warning.

           The message is in keeping with the output of <b>-fstack-usage</b>.

           *   If the stack usage is fully static but exceeds the specified amount, it's:

                         warning: stack usage is 1120 bytes

           *   If the stack usage is (partly) dynamic but bounded, it's:

                         warning: stack usage might be 1648 bytes

           *   If the stack usage is (partly) dynamic and not bounded, it's:

                         warning: stack usage might be unbounded

           <b>-Wstack-usage=PTRDIFF_MAX</b>  is  enabled by default.  Warnings controlled by the option can be disabled
           either by specifying <u>byte-size</u> of <b>SIZE_MAX</b> or more or by <b>-Wno-stack-usage</b>.

       <b>-Wno-stack-usage</b>
           Disable <b>-Wstack-usage=</b> warnings.  The option is equivalent to <b>-Wstack-usage=SIZE_MAX</b> or larger.

       <b>-Wunsafe-loop-optimizations</b>
           Warn if the loop cannot be optimized because the compiler cannot assume anything on the bounds of the
           loop indices.  With <b>-funsafe-loop-optimizations</b> warn if the compiler makes such assumptions.

       <b>-Wno-pedantic-ms-format</b> (MinGW targets only)
           When used in combination with <b>-Wformat</b> and <b>-pedantic</b> without GNU extensions, this option disables the
           warnings about non-ISO "printf" / "scanf" format width specifiers  "I32",  "I64",  and  "I"  used  on
           Windows targets, which depend on the MS runtime.

       <b>-Wpointer-arith</b>
           Warn  about anything that depends on the "size of" a function type or of "void".  GNU C assigns these
           types a size of 1, for convenience in calculations with "void *" pointers and pointers to  functions.
           In  C++,  warn  also  when  an arithmetic operation involves "NULL".  This warning is also enabled by
           <b>-Wpedantic</b>.

       <b>-Wno-pointer-compare</b>
           Do not warn if a pointer is compared with a zero character constant.  This  usually  means  that  the
           pointer was meant to be dereferenced.  For example:

                   const char *p = foo ();
                   if (p == '\0')
                     return 42;

           Note that the code above is invalid in C++11.

           This warning is enabled by default.

       <b>-Wtsan</b>
           Warn about unsupported features in ThreadSanitizer.

           ThreadSanitizer does not support "std::atomic_thread_fence" and can report false positives.

           This warning is enabled by default.

       <b>-Wtype-limits</b>
           Warn if a comparison is always true or always false due to the limited range of the data type, but do
           not  warn  for  constant  expressions.  For example, warn if an unsigned variable is compared against
           zero with "&lt;" or "&gt;=".  This warning is also enabled by <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-Wabsolute-value</b> (C and Objective-C only)
           Warn for calls to standard functions that compute the absolute value  of  an  argument  when  a  more
           appropriate  standard  function  is  available.   For example, calling abs(3.14) triggers the warning
           because the appropriate function to call to compute the  absolute  value  of  a  double  argument  is
           "fabs".   The  option  also  triggers  warnings when the argument in a call to such a function has an
           unsigned type.  This warning can be suppressed with an explicit type cast and it is also  enabled  by
           <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-Wcomment</b>
       <b>-Wcomments</b>
           Warn  whenever  a  comment-start sequence <b>/*</b> appears in a <b>/*</b> comment, or whenever a backslash-newline
           appears in a <b>//</b> comment.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wtrigraphs</b>
           Warn if any trigraphs are encountered that might change the meaning of the program.  Trigraphs within
           comments are not warned about, except those that would form escaped newlines.

           This option is implied by <b>-Wall</b>.  If <b>-Wall</b>  is  not  given,  this  option  is  still  enabled  unless
           trigraphs  are  enabled.   To  get  trigraph  conversion  without  warnings,  but get the other <b>-Wall</b>
           warnings, use <b>-trigraphs</b> <b>-Wall</b> <b>-Wno-trigraphs</b>.

       <b>-Wundef</b>
           Warn if an undefined identifier is evaluated in an "#if" directive.  Such  identifiers  are  replaced
           with zero.

       <b>-Wexpansion-to-defined</b>
           Warn  whenever <b>defined</b> is encountered in the expansion of a macro (including the case where the macro
           is expanded by an <b>#if</b> directive).  Such usage is not portable.   This  warning  is  also  enabled  by
           <b>-Wpedantic</b> and <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-Wunused-macros</b>
           Warn  about  macros  defined  in the main file that are unused.  A macro is <u>used</u> if it is expanded or
           tested for existence at least once.  The preprocessor also warns if the macro has not  been  used  at
           the time it is redefined or undefined.

           Built-in  macros,  macros  defined  on  the command line, and macros defined in include files are not
           warned about.

           <u>Note:</u> If a macro is actually used, but only used in skipped conditional blocks, then the preprocessor
           reports it as unused.  To avoid the warning in such a case,  you  might  improve  the  scope  of  the
           macro's definition by, for example, moving it into the first skipped block.  Alternatively, you could
           provide a dummy use with something like:

                   #if defined the_macro_causing_the_warning
                   #endif

       <b>-Wno-endif-labels</b>
           Do not warn whenever an "#else" or an "#endif" are followed by text.  This sometimes happens in older
           programs with code of the form

                   #if FOO
                   ...
                   #else FOO
                   ...
                   #endif FOO

           The second and third "FOO" should be in comments.  This warning is on by default.

       <b>-Wbad-function-cast</b> (C and Objective-C only)
           Warn  when a function call is cast to a non-matching type.  For example, warn if a call to a function
           returning an integer type is cast to a pointer type.

       <b>-Wc90-c99-compat</b> (C and Objective-C only)
           Warn about features not present in ISO C90, but present in ISO C99.  For instance, warn about use  of
           variable  length  arrays,  "long long" type, "bool" type, compound literals, designated initializers,
           and so on.  This option is  independent  of  the  standards  mode.   Warnings  are  disabled  in  the
           expression that follows "__extension__".

       <b>-Wc99-c11-compat</b> (C and Objective-C only)
           Warn  about features not present in ISO C99, but present in ISO C11.  For instance, warn about use of
           anonymous structures and unions, "_Atomic" type qualifier, "_Thread_local"  storage-class  specifier,
           "_Alignas"  specifier, "Alignof" operator, "_Generic" keyword, and so on.  This option is independent
           of the standards mode.  Warnings are disabled in the expression that follows "__extension__".

       <b>-Wc11-c2x-compat</b> (C and Objective-C only)
           Warn about features not present in ISO C11, but  present  in  ISO  C2X.   For  instance,  warn  about
           omitting  the string in "_Static_assert", use of <b>[[]]</b> syntax for attributes, use of decimal floating-
           point types, and so on.  This option is independent of the standards mode.  Warnings are disabled  in
           the expression that follows "__extension__".

       <b>-Wc++-compat</b> (C and Objective-C only)
           Warn  about ISO C constructs that are outside of the common subset of ISO C and ISO C++, e.g. request
           for implicit conversion from "void *" to a pointer to non-"void" type.

       <b>-Wc++11-compat</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn about C++ constructs whose meaning differs  between  ISO  C++  1998  and  ISO  C++  2011,  e.g.,
           identifiers in ISO C++ 1998 that are keywords in ISO C++ 2011.  This warning turns on <b>-Wnarrowing</b> and
           is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wc++14-compat</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn  about C++ constructs whose meaning differs between ISO C++ 2011 and ISO C++ 2014.  This warning
           is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wc++17-compat</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn about C++ constructs whose meaning differs between ISO C++ 2014 and ISO C++ 2017.  This  warning
           is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wc++20-compat</b> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn  about C++ constructs whose meaning differs between ISO C++ 2017 and ISO C++ 2020.  This warning
           is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wcast-qual</b>
           Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to remove a type qualifier from the target type.  For  example,
           warn if a "const char *" is cast to an ordinary "char *".

           Also warn when making a cast that introduces a type qualifier in an unsafe way.  For example, casting
           "char **" to "const char **" is unsafe, as in this example:

                     /* p is char ** value.  */
                     const char **q = (const char **) p;
                     /* Assignment of readonly string to const char * is OK.  */
                     *q = "string";
                     /* Now char** pointer points to read-only memory.  */
                     **p = 'b';

       <b>-Wcast-align</b>
           Warn  whenever  a  pointer  is cast such that the required alignment of the target is increased.  For
           example, warn if a "char *" is cast to an "int *" on machines where integers can only be accessed  at
           two- or four-byte boundaries.

       <b>-Wcast-align=strict</b>
           Warn  whenever  a  pointer  is cast such that the required alignment of the target is increased.  For
           example, warn if a "char *" is cast to an "int *" regardless of the target machine.

       <b>-Wcast-function-type</b>
           Warn when a function pointer is cast to an  incompatible  function  pointer.   In  a  cast  involving
           function  types  with  a variable argument list only the types of initial arguments that are provided
           are  considered.   Any  parameter  of  pointer-type  matches  any  other  pointer-type.   Any  benign
           differences  in  integral  types  are ignored, like "int" vs. "long" on ILP32 targets.  Likewise type
           qualifiers are ignored.  The function type "void (*) (void)" is special and matches everything, which
           can be used to suppress this warning.  In a cast involving pointer to member types this warning warns
           whenever the type cast is changing the pointer to member type.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-Wwrite-strings</b>
           When compiling C, give string constants the type "const char[<u>length</u>]" so that copying the address  of
           one  into a non-"const" "char *" pointer produces a warning.  These warnings help you find at compile
           time code that can try to write into a string constant, but only if you have been very careful  about
           using  "const"  in declarations and prototypes.  Otherwise, it is just a nuisance. This is why we did
           not make <b>-Wall</b> request these warnings.

           When compiling C++, warn about the deprecated conversion from string  literals  to  "char  *".   This
           warning is enabled by default for C++ programs.

       <b>-Wclobbered</b>
           Warn  for  variables  that might be changed by "longjmp" or "vfork".  This warning is also enabled by
           <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-Wconversion</b>
           Warn for implicit conversions that may alter a value. This  includes  conversions  between  real  and
           integer, like "abs (x)" when "x" is "double"; conversions between signed and unsigned, like "unsigned
           ui  = -1"; and conversions to smaller types, like "sqrtf (M_PI)". Do not warn for explicit casts like
           "abs ((int) x)" and "ui = (unsigned) -1", or if the value is not changed by the  conversion  like  in
           "abs  (2.0)".   Warnings  about  conversions  between signed and unsigned integers can be disabled by
           using <b>-Wno-sign-conversion</b>.

           For C++, also warn for confusing overload resolution for user-defined  conversions;  and  conversions
           that  never  use  a type conversion operator: conversions to "void", the same type, a base class or a
           reference to them. Warnings about conversions between signed and unsigned integers  are  disabled  by
           default in C++ unless <b>-Wsign-conversion</b> is explicitly enabled.

           Warnings  about  conversion  from  arithmetic  on  a small type back to that type are only given with
           <b>-Warith-conversion</b>.

       <b>-Wdangling-else</b>
           Warn about constructions where there may be confusion  to  which  "if"  statement  an  "else"  branch
           belongs.  Here is an example of such a case:

                   {
                     if (a)
                       if (b)
                         foo ();
                     else
                       bar ();
                   }

           In C/C++, every "else" branch belongs to the innermost possible "if" statement, which in this example
           is  "if (b)".  This is often not what the programmer expected, as illustrated in the above example by
           indentation the programmer chose.  When there is the potential  for  this  confusion,  GCC  issues  a
           warning  when  this  flag  is  specified.   To  eliminate the warning, add explicit braces around the
           innermost "if" statement so there is no way the  "else"  can  belong  to  the  enclosing  "if".   The
           resulting code looks like this:

                   {
                     if (a)
                       {
                         if (b)
                           foo ();
                         else
                           bar ();
                       }
                   }

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wparentheses</b>.

       <b>-Wdate-time</b>
           Warn when macros "__TIME__", "__DATE__" or "__TIMESTAMP__" are encountered as they might prevent bit-
           wise-identical reproducible compilations.

       <b>-Wempty-body</b>
           Warn  if  an  empty  body  occurs  in  an "if", "else" or "do while" statement.  This warning is also
           enabled by <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-Wno-endif-labels</b>
           Do not warn about stray tokens after "#else" and "#endif".

       <b>-Wenum-compare</b>
           Warn about a comparison between values  of  different  enumerated  types.   In  C++  enumerated  type
           mismatches in conditional expressions are also diagnosed and the warning is enabled by default.  In C
           this warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wenum-conversion</b>
           Warn  when  a  value of enumerated type is implicitly converted to a different enumerated type.  This
           warning is enabled by <b>-Wextra</b> in C.

       <b>-Wjump-misses-init</b> (C, Objective-C only)
           Warn if a "goto" statement or a "switch" statement jumps  forward  across  the  initialization  of  a
           variable,  or  jumps  backward  to  a label after the variable has been initialized.  This only warns
           about variables that are initialized when they are declared.  This warning is only  supported  for  C
           and Objective-C; in C++ this sort of branch is an error in any case.

           <b>-Wjump-misses-init</b>  is  included  in <b>-Wc++-compat</b>.  It can be disabled with the <b>-Wno-jump-misses-init</b>
           option.

       <b>-Wsign-compare</b>
           Warn when a comparison between signed and unsigned values could produce an incorrect result when  the
           signed  value  is converted to unsigned.  In C++, this warning is also enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.  In C, it is
           also enabled by <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-Wsign-conversion</b>
           Warn for implicit conversions that may change the sign of an integer value, like assigning  a  signed
           integer expression to an unsigned integer variable. An explicit cast silences the warning. In C, this
           option is enabled also by <b>-Wconversion</b>.

       <b>-Wfloat-conversion</b>
           Warn  for  implicit conversions that reduce the precision of a real value.  This includes conversions
           from real to integer, and from higher precision real to lower precision real values.  This option  is
           also enabled by <b>-Wconversion</b>.

       <b>-Wno-scalar-storage-order</b>
           Do not warn on suspicious constructs involving reverse scalar storage order.

       <b>-Wsizeof-array-div</b>
           Warn  about  divisions  of  two  sizeof  operators  when the first one is applied to an array and the
           divisor does not equal the size of the array element.  In such a case, the computation will not yield
           the number of elements in the array, which is likely what the user intended.  This warning warns e.g.
           about

                   int fn ()
                   {
                     int arr[10];
                     return sizeof (arr) / sizeof (short);
                   }

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wsizeof-pointer-div</b>
           Warn for suspicious divisions of two sizeof expressions that divide the pointer size by  the  element
           size,  which  is  the usual way to compute the array size but won't work out correctly with pointers.
           This warning warns e.g. about "sizeof (ptr) / sizeof (ptr[0])" if  "ptr"  is  not  an  array,  but  a
           pointer.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wsizeof-pointer-memaccess</b>
           Warn for suspicious length parameters to certain string and memory built-in functions if the argument
           uses  "sizeof".   This  warning triggers for example for "memset (ptr, 0, sizeof (ptr));" if "ptr" is
           not an array, but a pointer, and suggests a  possible  fix,  or  about  "memcpy  (&amp;foo,  ptr,  sizeof
           (&amp;foo));".   <b>-Wsizeof-pointer-memaccess</b>  also warns about calls to bounded string copy functions like
           "strncat" or "strncpy" that specify as the bound a "sizeof" expression  of  the  source  array.   For
           example,  in  the following function the call to "strncat" specifies the size of the source string as
           the bound.  That is almost certainly a mistake and so the call is diagnosed.

                   void make_file (const char *name)
                   {
                     char path[PATH_MAX];
                     strncpy (path, name, sizeof path - 1);
                     strncat (path, ".text", sizeof ".text");
                     ...
                   }

           The <b>-Wsizeof-pointer-memaccess</b> option is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wno-sizeof-array-argument</b>
           Do not warn when the "sizeof" operator is applied to a parameter that is declared as an  array  in  a
           function definition.  This warning is enabled by default for C and C++ programs.

       <b>-Wmemset-elt-size</b>
           Warn  for  suspicious  calls  to  the "memset" built-in function, if the first argument references an
           array, and the third argument is a number equal to the number of elements, but not equal to the  size
           of  the  array  in  memory.  This indicates that the user has omitted a multiplication by the element
           size.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wmemset-transposed-args</b>
           Warn for suspicious calls to the "memset" built-in function where the second argument is not zero and
           the third argument is zero.  For example, the call "memset (buf, sizeof buf, 0)" is diagnosed because
           "memset (buf, 0, sizeof buf)" was meant instead.   The  diagnostic  is  only  emitted  if  the  third
           argument  is  a literal zero.  Otherwise, if it is an expression that is folded to zero, or a cast of
           zero to some type, it is far less likely that the arguments have been mistakenly  transposed  and  no
           warning is emitted.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Waddress</b>
           Warn  about  suspicious  uses of memory addresses. These include using the address of a function in a
           conditional expression, such as "void func(void); if (func)",  and  comparisons  against  the  memory
           address  of  a  string literal, such as "if (x == "abc")".  Such uses typically indicate a programmer
           error: the address of a function always evaluates to true, so their  use  in  a  conditional  usually
           indicate  that  the  programmer  forgot  the  parentheses in a function call; and comparisons against
           string literals result in unspecified behavior and are not portable in C, so  they  usually  indicate
           that the programmer intended to use "strcmp".  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wno-address-of-packed-member</b>
           Do  not  warn when the address of packed member of struct or union is taken, which usually results in
           an unaligned pointer value.  This is enabled by default.

       <b>-Wlogical-op</b>
           Warn about suspicious uses  of  logical  operators  in  expressions.   This  includes  using  logical
           operators  in  contexts  where  a  bit-wise  operator  is likely to be expected.  Also warns when the
           operands of a logical operator are the same:

                   extern int a;
                   if (a &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; a &lt; 0) { ... }

       <b>-Wlogical-not-parentheses</b>
           Warn about logical not used on the left hand side operand of a comparison.  This option does not warn
           if the right operand is considered to be a boolean expression.  Its purpose is to  detect  suspicious
           code like the following:

                   int a;
                   ...
                   if (!a &gt; 1) { ... }

           It is possible to suppress the warning by wrapping the LHS into parentheses:

                   if ((!a) &gt; 1) { ... }

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Waggregate-return</b>
           Warn  if  any  functions that return structures or unions are defined or called.  (In languages where
           you can return an array, this also elicits a warning.)

       <b>-Wno-aggressive-loop-optimizations</b>
           Warn if in a loop with constant number of iterations the compiler detects undefined behavior in  some
           statement during one or more of the iterations.

       <b>-Wno-attributes</b>
           Do  not  warn  if  an  unexpected  "__attribute__" is used, such as unrecognized attributes, function
           attributes applied to variables, etc.  This does not stop  errors  for  incorrect  use  of  supported
           attributes.

       <b>-Wno-builtin-declaration-mismatch</b>
           Warn  if a built-in function is declared with an incompatible signature or as a non-function, or when
           a built-in function declared with a type that does not include a prototype is called  with  arguments
           whose  promoted  types  do not match those expected by the function.  When <b>-Wextra</b> is specified, also
           warn  when  a  built-in  function  that  takes  arguments  is  declared  without  a  prototype.   The
           <b>-Wbuiltin-declaration-mismatch</b>  warning  is  enabled  by  default.   To avoid the warning include the
           appropriate header to bring the prototypes of built-in functions into scope.

           For example, the call to "memset" below is diagnosed by the warning because the  function  expects  a
           value of type "size_t" as its argument but the type of 32 is "int".  With <b>-Wextra</b>, the declaration of
           the function is diagnosed as well.

                   extern void* memset ();
                   void f (void *d)
                   {
                     memset (d, '\0', 32);
                   }

       <b>-Wno-builtin-macro-redefined</b>
           Do  not  warn if certain built-in macros are redefined.  This suppresses warnings for redefinition of
           "__TIMESTAMP__", "__TIME__", "__DATE__", "__FILE__", and "__BASE_FILE__".

       <b>-Wstrict-prototypes</b> (C and Objective-C only)
           Warn if a function is declared or defined without  specifying  the  argument  types.   (An  old-style
           function  definition  is  permitted without a warning if preceded by a declaration that specifies the
           argument types.)

       <b>-Wold-style-declaration</b> (C and Objective-C only)
           Warn for obsolescent usages, according to the C Standard, in a  declaration.  For  example,  warn  if
           storage-class  specifiers  like  "static" are not the first things in a declaration.  This warning is
           also enabled by <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-Wold-style-definition</b> (C and Objective-C only)
           Warn if an old-style function definition is used.  A warning is given even if  there  is  a  previous
           prototype.   A  definition using <b>()</b> is not considered an old-style definition in C2X mode, because it
           is equivalent to <b>(void)</b> in that case, but is considered an old-style definition for older standards.

       <b>-Wmissing-parameter-type</b> (C and Objective-C only)
           A function parameter is declared without a type specifier in K&amp;R-style functions:

                   void foo(bar) { }

           This warning is also enabled by <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-Wmissing-prototypes</b> (C and Objective-C only)
           Warn if a global function is defined without a  previous  prototype  declaration.   This  warning  is
           issued  even  if  the  definition  itself  provides  a  prototype.   Use this option to detect global
           functions that do not have a matching prototype declaration in a header file.   This  option  is  not
           valid  for  C++  because  all function declarations provide prototypes and a non-matching declaration
           declares an overload rather than conflict with an earlier declaration.  Use <b>-Wmissing-declarations</b> to
           detect missing declarations in C++.

       <b>-Wmissing-declarations</b>
           Warn if a global function is defined without a previous declaration.  Do so even  if  the  definition
           itself  provides  a  prototype.   Use this option to detect global functions that are not declared in
           header files.  In C, no warnings are issued for functions with previous  non-prototype  declarations;
           use  <b>-Wmissing-prototypes</b>  to detect missing prototypes.  In C++, no warnings are issued for function
           templates, or for inline functions, or for functions in anonymous namespaces.

       <b>-Wmissing-field-initializers</b>
           Warn if a structure's initializer has some fields missing.  For example, the  following  code  causes
           such a warning, because "x.h" is implicitly zero:

                   struct s { int f, g, h; };
                   struct s x = { 3, 4 };

           This  option  does  not  warn  about  designated initializers, so the following modification does not
           trigger a warning:

                   struct s { int f, g, h; };
                   struct s x = { .f = 3, .g = 4 };

           In C this option does not warn about the universal zero initializer <b>{</b> <b>0</b> <b>}</b>:

                   struct s { int f, g, h; };
                   struct s x = { 0 };

           Likewise, in C++ this option does not warn about the empty { } initializer, for example:

                   struct s { int f, g, h; };
                   s x = { };

           This warning is included in <b>-Wextra</b>.  To get other <b>-Wextra</b> warnings without  this  one,  use  <b>-Wextra</b>
           <b>-Wno-missing-field-initializers</b>.

       <b>-Wno-multichar</b>
           Do  not  warn  if  a  multicharacter  constant (<b>'FOOF'</b>) is used.  Usually they indicate a typo in the
           user's code, as they have implementation-defined values, and should not be used in portable code.

       <b>-Wnormalized=</b>[<b>none</b>|<b>id</b>|<b>nfc</b>|<b>nfkc</b>]
           In ISO C and ISO C++, two identifiers are different if they are different  sequences  of  characters.
           However,  sometimes  when characters outside the basic ASCII character set are used, you can have two
           different character sequences that look the same.  To avoid confusion, the ISO  10646  standard  sets
           out  some  <u>normalization</u>  <u>rules</u>  which  when applied ensure that two sequences that look the same are
           turned into the same sequence.  GCC can warn you if you are using  identifiers  that  have  not  been
           normalized; this option controls that warning.

           There  are  four  levels  of  warning supported by GCC.  The default is <b>-Wnormalized=nfc</b>, which warns
           about any identifier that is not in the ISO 10646 "C" normalized form, <u>NFC</u>.  NFC is  the  recommended
           form for most uses.  It is equivalent to <b>-Wnormalized</b>.

           Unfortunately,  there  are  some  characters  allowed  in identifiers by ISO C and ISO C++ that, when
           turned into NFC, are not allowed in identifiers.  That is, there's no way to  use  these  symbols  in
           portable  ISO  C or C++ and have all your identifiers in NFC.  <b>-Wnormalized=id</b> suppresses the warning
           for these characters.  It is hoped that future versions of the standards involved will correct  this,
           which is why this option is not the default.

           You  can  switch  the warning off for all characters by writing <b>-Wnormalized=none</b> or <b>-Wno-normalized</b>.
           You should only do this if you  are  using  some  other  normalization  scheme  (like  "D"),  because
           otherwise you can easily create bugs that are literally impossible to see.

           Some  characters  in  ISO  10646  have  distinct meanings but look identical in some fonts or display
           methodologies, especially once formatting has been  applied.   For  instance  "\u207F",  "SUPERSCRIPT
           LATIN  SMALL  LETTER N", displays just like a regular "n" that has been placed in a superscript.  ISO
           10646 defines the <u>NFKC</u> normalization scheme to convert all these into a standard form  as  well,  and
           GCC  warns  if  your code is not in NFKC if you use <b>-Wnormalized=nfkc</b>.  This warning is comparable to
           warning about every identifier that contains the letter O because it might be confused with the digit
           0, and so is not the default, but may be useful as a  local  coding  convention  if  the  programming
           environment cannot be fixed to display these characters distinctly.

       <b>-Wno-attribute-warning</b>
           Do  not warn about usage of functions declared with "warning" attribute.  By default, this warning is
           enabled.  <b>-Wno-attribute-warning</b> can be used to disable the warning  or  <b>-Wno-error=attribute-warning</b>
           can be used to disable the error when compiled with <b>-Werror</b> flag.

       <b>-Wno-deprecated</b>
           Do not warn about usage of deprecated features.

       <b>-Wno-deprecated-declarations</b>
           Do  not  warn  about  uses  of  functions,  variables,  and  types  marked as deprecated by using the
           "deprecated" attribute.

       <b>-Wno-overflow</b>
           Do not warn about compile-time overflow in constant expressions.

       <b>-Wno-odr</b>
           Warn about One Definition Rule violations during link-time optimization.  Enabled by default.

       <b>-Wopenmp-simd</b>
           Warn  if  the  vectorizer  cost  model  overrides  the  OpenMP  simd  directive  set  by  user.   The
           <b>-fsimd-cost-model=unlimited</b> option can be used to relax the cost model.

       <b>-Woverride-init</b> (C and Objective-C only)
           Warn if an initialized field without side effects is overridden when using designated initializers.

           This  warning  is  included  in <b>-Wextra</b>.  To get other <b>-Wextra</b> warnings without this one, use <b>-Wextra</b>
           <b>-Wno-override-init</b>.

       <b>-Wno-override-init-side-effects</b> (C and Objective-C only)
           Do not warn  if  an  initialized  field  with  side  effects  is  overridden  when  using  designated
           initializers.  This warning is enabled by default.

       <b>-Wpacked</b>
           Warn  if  a  structure  is  given the packed attribute, but the packed attribute has no effect on the
           layout or size of the structure.  Such  structures  may  be  mis-aligned  for  little  benefit.   For
           instance,  in  this  code,  the variable "f.x" in "struct bar" is misaligned even though "struct bar"
           does not itself have the packed attribute:

                   struct foo {
                     int x;
                     char a, b, c, d;
                   } __attribute__((packed));
                   struct bar {
                     char z;
                     struct foo f;
                   };

       <b>-Wnopacked-bitfield-compat</b>
           The 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 series of GCC ignore the "packed" attribute on bit-fields of type "char".   This
           was fixed in GCC 4.4 but the change can lead to differences in the structure layout.  GCC informs you
           when  the  offset  of  such  a  field has changed in GCC 4.4.  For example there is no longer a 4-bit
           padding between field "a" and "b" in this structure:

                   struct foo
                   {
                     char a:4;
                     char b:8;
                   } __attribute__ ((packed));

           This warning is enabled by default.  Use <b>-Wno-packed-bitfield-compat</b> to disable this warning.

       <b>-Wpacked-not-aligned</b> (C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn if a structure field with explicitly  specified  alignment  in  a  packed  struct  or  union  is
           misaligned.   For  example,  a  warning  will be issued on "struct S", like, "warning: alignment 1 of
           'struct S' is less than 8", in this code:

                   struct __attribute__ ((aligned (8))) S8 { char a[8]; };
                   struct __attribute__ ((packed)) S {
                     struct S8 s8;
                   };

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wpadded</b>
           Warn if padding is included in a structure, either to align an element of the structure or  to  align
           the  whole  structure.   Sometimes  when  this  happens it is possible to rearrange the fields of the
           structure to reduce the padding and so make the structure smaller.

       <b>-Wredundant-decls</b>
           Warn if anything is declared more than  once  in  the  same  scope,  even  in  cases  where  multiple
           declaration is valid and changes nothing.

       <b>-Wrestrict</b>
           Warn   when   an   object   referenced   by   a   "restrict"-qualified   parameter  (or,  in  C++,  a
           "__restrict"-qualified parameter) is aliased by another argument, or when copies between such objects
           overlap.  For example, the call to the "strcpy" function below attempts to  truncate  the  string  by
           replacing  its  initial  characters  with  the  last  four.   However,  because  the  call writes the
           terminating NUL into "a[4]", the copies overlap and the call is diagnosed.

                   void foo (void)
                   {
                     char a[] = "abcd1234";
                     strcpy (a, a + 4);
                     ...
                   }

           The <b>-Wrestrict</b> option detects some instances of simple overlap even without  optimization  but  works
           best at <b>-O2</b> and above.  It is included in <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wnested-externs</b> (C and Objective-C only)
           Warn if an "extern" declaration is encountered within a function.

       <b>-Winline</b>
           Warn if a function that is declared as inline cannot be inlined.  Even with this option, the compiler
           does not warn about failures to inline functions declared in system headers.

           The  compiler  uses  a  variety  of heuristics to determine whether or not to inline a function.  For
           example, the compiler takes into account the size of the function being inlined  and  the  amount  of
           inlining  that  has  already  been  done in the current function.  Therefore, seemingly insignificant
           changes in the source program can cause the warnings produced by <b>-Winline</b> to appear or disappear.

       <b>-Wint-in-bool-context</b>
           Warn for suspicious use of integer values where boolean values  are  expected,  such  as  conditional
           expressions  (?:) using non-boolean integer constants in boolean context, like "if (a &lt;= b ? 2 : 3)".
           Or left shifting of signed integers in boolean context, like "for (a = 0; 1 &lt;&lt; a;  a++);".   Likewise
           for all kinds of multiplications regardless of the data type.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wno-int-to-pointer-cast</b>
           Suppress  warnings from casts to pointer type of an integer of a different size. In C++, casting to a
           pointer type of smaller size is an error. <b>Wint-to-pointer-cast</b> is enabled by default.

       <b>-Wno-pointer-to-int-cast</b> (C and Objective-C only)
           Suppress warnings from casts from a pointer to an integer type of a different size.

       <b>-Winvalid-pch</b>
           Warn if a precompiled header is found in the search path but cannot be used.

       <b>-Wlong-long</b>
           Warn if "long long" type is used.  This is enabled by either <b>-Wpedantic</b> or <b>-Wtraditional</b> in  ISO  C90
           and C++98 modes.  To inhibit the warning messages, use <b>-Wno-long-long</b>.

       <b>-Wvariadic-macros</b>
           Warn  if  variadic macros are used in ISO C90 mode, or if the GNU alternate syntax is used in ISO C99
           mode.  This is enabled by either <b>-Wpedantic</b> or <b>-Wtraditional</b>.  To inhibit the warning  messages,  use
           <b>-Wno-variadic-macros</b>.

       <b>-Wno-varargs</b>
           Do  not warn upon questionable usage of the macros used to handle variable arguments like "va_start".
           These warnings are enabled by default.

       <b>-Wvector-operation-performance</b>
           Warn if vector operation is not implemented via SIMD capabilities of the architecture.  Mainly useful
           for the performance tuning.  Vector operation can be implemented "piecewise", which  means  that  the
           scalar  operation  is  performed  on every vector element; "in parallel", which means that the vector
           operation is implemented using scalars of wider type, which normally is more  performance  efficient;
           and "as a single scalar", which means that vector fits into a scalar type.

       <b>-Wvla</b>
           Warn if a variable-length array is used in the code.  <b>-Wno-vla</b> prevents the <b>-Wpedantic</b> warning of the
           variable-length array.

       <b>-Wvla-larger-than=</b><u>byte-size</u>
           If  this  option is used, the compiler warns for declarations of variable-length arrays whose size is
           either unbounded, or bounded by an argument that allows the array size  to  exceed  <u>byte-size</u>  bytes.
           This is similar to how <b>-Walloca-larger-than=</b><u>byte-size</u> works, but with variable-length arrays.

           Note  that  GCC may optimize small variable-length arrays of a known value into plain arrays, so this
           warning may not get triggered for such arrays.

           <b>-Wvla-larger-than=PTRDIFF_MAX</b> is enabled by default but is typically only effective  when  <b>-ftree-vrp</b>
           is active (default for <b>-O2</b> and above).

           See also <b>-Walloca-larger-than=</b><u>byte-size</u>.

       <b>-Wno-vla-larger-than</b>
           Disable  <b>-Wvla-larger-than=</b>  warnings.   The  option  is  equivalent to <b>-Wvla-larger-than=SIZE_MAX</b> or
           larger.

       <b>-Wvla-parameter</b>
           Warn about redeclarations of  functions  involving  arguments  of  Variable  Length  Array  types  of
           inconsistent kinds or forms, and enable the detection of out-of-bounds accesses to such parameters by
           warnings such as <b>-Warray-bounds</b>.

           If the first function declaration uses the VLA form the bound specified in the array is assumed to be
           the  minimum  number  of  elements  expected  to be provided in calls to the function and the maximum
           number of elements accessed by it.  Failing to provide arguments of sufficient size or accessing more
           than the maximum number of elements may be diagnosed.

           For example, the warning triggers for the following redeclarations because the first  one  allows  an
           array  of  any  size  to be passed to "f" while the second one specifies that the array argument must
           have at least "n" elements.  In addition, calling "f" with the  assotiated  VLA  bound  parameter  in
           excess of the actual VLA bound triggers a warning as well.

                   void f (int n, int[n]);
                   void f (int, int[]);     // warning: argument 2 previously declared as a VLA

                   void g (int n)
                   {
                       if (n &gt; 4)
                         return;
                       int a[n];
                       f (sizeof a, a);     // warning: access to a by f may be out of bounds
                     ...
                   }

           <b>-Wvla-parameter</b>  is  included  in  <b>-Wall</b>.  The <b>-Warray-parameter</b> option triggers warnings for similar
           problems involving ordinary array arguments.

       <b>-Wvolatile-register-var</b>
           Warn if a register variable is declared  volatile.   The  volatile  modifier  does  not  inhibit  all
           optimizations  that may eliminate reads and/or writes to register variables.  This warning is enabled
           by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wdisabled-optimization</b>
           Warn if a requested optimization pass is disabled.  This warning does  not  generally  indicate  that
           there  is  anything  wrong  with  your  code; it merely indicates that GCC's optimizers are unable to
           handle the code effectively.  Often, the problem is that your code is too big  or  too  complex;  GCC
           refuses  to  optimize  programs  when the optimization itself is likely to take inordinate amounts of
           time.

       <b>-Wpointer-sign</b> (C and Objective-C only)
           Warn for pointer argument passing or assignment with  different  signedness.   This  option  is  only
           supported  for  C  and  Objective-C.  It is implied by <b>-Wall</b> and by <b>-Wpedantic</b>, which can be disabled
           with <b>-Wno-pointer-sign</b>.

       <b>-Wstack-protector</b>
           This option is only active when <b>-fstack-protector</b> is active.  It warns about functions that  are  not
           protected against stack smashing.

       <b>-Woverlength-strings</b>
           Warn  about  string  constants  that  are longer than the "minimum maximum" length specified in the C
           standard.  Modern compilers generally allow string constants that are much longer than the standard's
           minimum limit, but very portable programs should avoid using longer strings.

           The limit applies <u>after</u> string constant concatenation, and does not count the trailing NUL.  In  C90,
           the  limit  was  509  characters;  in C99, it was raised to 4095.  C++98 does not specify a normative
           minimum maximum, so we do not diagnose overlength strings in C++.

           This option is implied by <b>-Wpedantic</b>, and can be disabled with <b>-Wno-overlength-strings</b>.

       <b>-Wunsuffixed-float-constants</b> (C and Objective-C only)
           Issue a warning for any floating constant that does not have  a  suffix.   When  used  together  with
           <b>-Wsystem-headers</b>  it  warns  about  such  constants  in system header files.  This can be useful when
           preparing code to use  with  the  "FLOAT_CONST_DECIMAL64"  pragma  from  the  decimal  floating-point
           extension to C99.

       <b>-Wno-lto-type-mismatch</b>
           During  the  link-time  optimization,  do  not warn about type mismatches in global declarations from
           different compilation units.  Requires <b>-flto</b> to be enabled.  Enabled by default.

       <b>-Wno-designated-init</b> (C and Objective-C only)
           Suppress warnings when a positional initializer is used to  initialize  a  structure  that  has  been
           marked with the "designated_init" attribute.

   <b>Options</b> <b>That</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Static</b> <b>Analysis</b>
       <b>-fanalyzer</b>
           This  option enables an static analysis of program flow which looks for "interesting" interprocedural
           paths through the code, and issues warnings for problems found on them.

           This analysis is much more expensive than other GCC warnings.

           Enabling this option effectively enables the following warnings:

           <b>-Wanalyzer-double-fclose</b>        <b>-Wanalyzer-double-free</b>        <b>-Wanalyzer-exposure-through-output-file</b>
           <b>-Wanalyzer-file-leak</b>                <b>-Wanalyzer-free-of-non-heap</b>                <b>-Wanalyzer-malloc-leak</b>

           <b>-Wanalyzer-possible-null-dereference</b>       <b>-Wanalyzer-null-argument</b>       <b>-Wanalyzer-null-dereference</b>
           <b>-Wanalyzer-shift-count-negative</b>    <b>-Wanalyzer-shift-count-overflow</b>     <b>-Wanalyzer-stale-setjmp-buffer</b>
           <b>-Wanalyzer-tainted-array-index</b> <b>-Wanalyzer-unsafe-call-within-signal-handler</b> <b>-Wanalyzer-use-after-free</b>
           <b>-Wanalyzer-use-of-pointer-in-stale-stack-frame</b>                              <b>-Wanalyzer-write-to-const</b>
           <b>-Wanalyzer-write-to-string-literal</b>

           This option is only available if GCC was configured with analyzer support enabled.

       <b>-Wanalyzer-too-complex</b>
           If <b>-fanalyzer</b> is enabled, the analyzer uses various heuristics to attempt to explore the control flow
           and data flow in the program, but these can be defeated by sufficiently complicated code.

           By default, the analysis silently stops if the code is too complicated  for  the  analyzer  to  fully
           explore and it reaches an internal limit.  The <b>-Wanalyzer-too-complex</b> option warns if this occurs.

       <b>-Wno-analyzer-double-fclose</b>
           This warning requires <b>-fanalyzer</b>, which enables it; use <b>-Wno-analyzer-double-fclose</b> to disable it.

           This  diagnostic  warns for paths through the code in which a "FILE *" can have "fclose" called on it
           more than once.

       <b>-Wno-analyzer-double-free</b>
           This warning requires <b>-fanalyzer</b>, which enables it; use <b>-Wno-analyzer-double-free</b> to disable it.

           This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a pointer can have a deallocator called  on
           it more than once, either "free", or a deallocator referenced by attribute "malloc".

       <b>-Wno-analyzer-exposure-through-output-file</b>
           This warning requires <b>-fanalyzer</b>, which enables it; use <b>-Wno-analyzer-exposure-through-output-file</b> to
           disable it.

           This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a security-sensitive value is written to an
           output file (such as writing a password to a log file).

       <b>-Wno-analyzer-file-leak</b>
           This warning requires <b>-fanalyzer</b>, which enables it; use <b>-Wno-analyzer-file-leak</b> to disable it.

           This  diagnostic  warns  for  paths through the code in which a "&lt;stdio.h&gt;" "FILE *" stream object is
           leaked.

       <b>-Wno-analyzer-free-of-non-heap</b>
           This warning requires <b>-fanalyzer</b>, which enables it; use <b>-Wno-analyzer-free-of-non-heap</b> to disable it.

           This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which "free" is  called  on  a  non-heap  pointer
           (e.g. an on-stack buffer, or a global).

       <b>-Wno-analyzer-malloc-leak</b>
           This warning requires <b>-fanalyzer</b>, which enables it; use <b>-Wno-analyzer-malloc-leak</b> to disable it.

           This  diagnostic  warns  for  paths through the code in which a pointer allocated via an allocator is
           leaked: either "malloc", or a function marked with attribute "malloc".

       <b>-Wno-analyzer-mismatching-deallocation</b>
           This warning requires <b>-fanalyzer</b>, which enables  it;  use  <b>-Wno-analyzer-mismatching-deallocation</b>  to
           disable it.

           This  diagnostic  warns for paths through the code in which the wrong deallocation function is called
           on a pointer value, based on which function was used to allocate the pointer value.   The  diagnostic
           will warn about mismatches between "free", scalar "delete" and vector "delete[]", and those marked as
           allocator/deallocator pairs using attribute "malloc".

       <b>-Wno-analyzer-possible-null-argument</b>
           This  warning  requires  <b>-fanalyzer</b>,  which  enables  it; use <b>-Wno-analyzer-possible-null-argument</b> to

           This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which  a  possibly-NULL  value  is  passed  to  a
           function argument marked with "__attribute__((nonnull))" as requiring a non-NULL value.

       <b>-Wno-analyzer-possible-null-dereference</b>
           This  warning  requires  <b>-fanalyzer</b>, which enables it; use <b>-Wno-analyzer-possible-null-dereference</b> to
           disable it.

           This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a possibly-NULL value is dereferenced.

       <b>-Wno-analyzer-null-argument</b>
           This warning requires <b>-fanalyzer</b>, which enables it; use <b>-Wno-analyzer-null-argument</b> to disable it.

           This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a value known to be NULL  is  passed  to  a
           function argument marked with "__attribute__((nonnull))" as requiring a non-NULL value.

       <b>-Wno-analyzer-null-dereference</b>
           This warning requires <b>-fanalyzer</b>, which enables it; use <b>-Wno-analyzer-null-dereference</b> to disable it.

           This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a value known to be NULL is dereferenced.

       <b>-Wno-analyzer-shift-count-negative</b>
           This warning requires <b>-fanalyzer</b>, which enables it; use <b>-Wno-analyzer-shift-count-negative</b> to disable
           it.

           This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a shift is attempted with a negative count.
           It  is analogous to the <b>-Wshift-count-negative</b> diagnostic implemented in the C/C++ front ends, but is
           implemented based on analyzing interprocedural paths, rather than merely  parsing  the  syntax  tree.
           However, the analyzer does not prioritize detection of such paths, so false negatives are more likely
           relative to other warnings.

       <b>-Wno-analyzer-shift-count-overflow</b>
           This warning requires <b>-fanalyzer</b>, which enables it; use <b>-Wno-analyzer-shift-count-overflow</b> to disable
           it.

           This  diagnostic  warns for paths through the code in which a shift is attempted with a count greater
           than or equal to the precision of the operand's type.  It is analogous to the  <b>-Wshift-count-overflow</b>
           diagnostic implemented in the C/C++ front ends, but is implemented based on analyzing interprocedural
           paths,  rather  than  merely  parsing  the  syntax  tree.   However, the analyzer does not prioritize
           detection of such paths, so false negatives are more likely relative to other warnings.

       <b>-Wno-analyzer-stale-setjmp-buffer</b>
           This warning requires <b>-fanalyzer</b>, which enables it; use <b>-Wno-analyzer-stale-setjmp-buffer</b> to  disable
           it.

           This  diagnostic  warns  for  paths  through  the  code  in  which "longjmp" is called to rewind to a
           "jmp_buf" relating to a "setjmp" call in a function that has returned.

           When "setjmp" is called on a "jmp_buf" to record a rewind location, it records the stack frame.   The
           stack  frame  becomes  invalid when the function containing the "setjmp" call returns.  Attempting to
           rewind to it via "longjmp" would reference a stack frame that no longer exists, and likely lead to  a
           crash (or worse).

       <b>-Wno-analyzer-tainted-array-index</b>
           This   warning   requires   both   <b>-fanalyzer</b>   and   <b>-fanalyzer-checker=taint</b>   to  enable  it;  use
           <b>-Wno-analyzer-tainted-array-index</b> to disable it.

           This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a value that could be under  an  attacker's
           control is used as the index of an array access without being sanitized.

       <b>-Wno-analyzer-unsafe-call-within-signal-handler</b>
           This        warning        requires        <b>-fanalyzer</b>,        which       enables       it;       use
           <b>-Wno-analyzer-unsafe-call-within-signal-handler</b> to disable it.

           This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a function known to be  async-signal-unsafe
           (such as "fprintf") is called from a signal handler.

       <b>-Wno-analyzer-use-after-free</b>
           This warning requires <b>-fanalyzer</b>, which enables it; use <b>-Wno-analyzer-use-after-free</b> to disable it.

           This  diagnostic  warns  for paths through the code in which a pointer is used after a deallocator is
           called on it: either "free", or a deallocator referenced by attribute "malloc".

       <b>-Wno-analyzer-use-of-pointer-in-stale-stack-frame</b>
           This       warning       requires       <b>-fanalyzer</b>,        which        enables        it;        use
           <b>-Wno-analyzer-use-of-pointer-in-stale-stack-frame</b> to disable it.

           This  diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a pointer is dereferenced that points to a
           variable in a stale stack frame.

       <b>-Wno-analyzer-write-to-const</b>
           This warning requires <b>-fanalyzer</b>, which enables it; use <b>-Wno-analyzer-write-to-const</b> to disable it.

           This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which the analyzer detects an  attempt  to  write
           through  a  pointer to a "const" object.  However, the analyzer does not prioritize detection of such
           paths, so false negatives are more likely relative to other warnings.

       <b>-Wno-analyzer-write-to-string-literal</b>
           This warning requires <b>-fanalyzer</b>, which  enables  it;  use  <b>-Wno-analyzer-write-to-string-literal</b>  to
           disable it.

           This  diagnostic  warns  for paths through the code in which the analyzer detects an attempt to write
           through a pointer to a string literal.  However, the analyzer does not prioritize detection  of  such
           paths, so false negatives are more likely relative to other warnings.

       Pertinent  parameters  for  controlling  the exploration are: <b>--param</b> <b>analyzer-bb-explosion-factor=</b><u>value</u>,
       <b>--param</b>  <b>analyzer-max-enodes-per-program-point=</b><u>value</u>,  <b>--param</b>  <b>analyzer-max-recursion-depth=</b><u>value</u>,   and
       <b>--param</b> <b>analyzer-min-snodes-for-call-summary=</b><u>value</u>.

       The following options control the analyzer.

       <b>-fanalyzer-call-summaries</b>
           Simplify interprocedural analysis by computing the effect of certain calls, rather than exploring all
           paths through the function from callsite to each possible return.

           If  enabled,  call  summaries  are only used for functions with more than one call site, and that are
           sufficiently complicated (as per <b>--param</b> <b>analyzer-min-snodes-for-call-summary=</b><u>value</u>).

       <b>-fanalyzer-checker=</b><u>name</u>
           Restrict the analyzer to run just the named checker, and enable it.

           Some checkers are disabled by default (even with  <b>-fanalyzer</b>),  such  as  the  "taint"  checker  that
           implements <b>-Wanalyzer-tainted-array-index</b>, and this option is required to enable them.

       <b>-fno-analyzer-feasibility</b>
           This option is intended for analyzer developers.

           By  default  the  analyzer verifies that there is a feasible control flow path for each diagnostic it
           emits: that the conditions that hold are not mutually exclusive.  Diagnostics for which  no  feasible
           path can be found are rejected.  This filtering can be suppressed with <b>-fno-analyzer-feasibility</b>, for
           debugging issues in this code.

       <b>-fanalyzer-fine-grained</b>
           This option is intended for analyzer developers.

           Internally  the  analyzer builds an "exploded graph" that combines control flow graphs with data flow
           information.

           By default, an edge in this graph can contain the effects of a run of multiple  statements  within  a
           basic block.  With <b>-fanalyzer-fine-grained</b>, each statement gets its own edge.

       <b>-fanalyzer-show-duplicate-count</b>
           This  option is intended for analyzer developers: if multiple diagnostics have been detected as being
           duplicates of each other, it emits a note when reporting the best diagnostic, giving  the  number  of
           additional diagnostics that were suppressed by the deduplication logic.

       <b>-fno-analyzer-state-merge</b>
           This option is intended for analyzer developers.

           By  default the analyzer attempts to simplify analysis by merging sufficiently similar states at each
           program point as it builds its "exploded graph".  With <b>-fno-analyzer-state-merge</b> this merging can  be
           suppressed, for debugging state-handling issues.

       <b>-fno-analyzer-state-purge</b>
           This option is intended for analyzer developers.

           By  default the analyzer attempts to simplify analysis by purging aspects of state at a program point
           that appear to no longer be relevant e.g. the values of locals that  aren't  accessed  later  in  the
           function and which aren't relevant to leak analysis.

           With  <b>-fno-analyzer-state-purge</b> this purging of state can be suppressed, for debugging state-handling
           issues.

       <b>-fanalyzer-transitivity</b>
           This option enables transitivity of constraints within the analyzer.

       <b>-fanalyzer-verbose-edges</b>
           This option is intended for analyzer developers.  It enables more verbose, lower-level detail in  the
           descriptions of control flow within diagnostic paths.

       <b>-fanalyzer-verbose-state-changes</b>
           This  option is intended for analyzer developers.  It enables more verbose, lower-level detail in the
           descriptions of events relating to state machines within diagnostic paths.

       <b>-fanalyzer-verbosity=</b><u>level</u>
           This option controls the complexity  of  the  control  flow  paths  that  are  emitted  for  analyzer
           diagnostics.

           The <u>level</u> can be one of:

           <b>0</b>   At  this  level,  interprocedural  call  and  return  events  are  displayed, along with the most
               pertinent state-change events relating  to  a  diagnostic.   For  example,  for  a  double-"free"
               diagnostic, both calls to "free" will be shown.

           <b>1</b>   As per the previous level, but also show events for the entry to each function.

           <b>2</b>   As  per the previous level, but also show events relating to control flow that are significant to
               triggering the issue (e.g. "true path taken" at a conditional).

               This level is the default.

           <b>3</b>   As per the previous level, but show all control flow events, not just significant ones.

           <b>4</b>   This level is intended for analyzer  developers;  it  adds  various  other  events  intended  for
               debugging the analyzer.

       <b>-fdump-analyzer</b>
           Dump  internal  details  about  what  the  analyzer  is  doing  to <u>file.analyzer.txt</u>.  This option is
           overridden by <b>-fdump-analyzer-stderr</b>.

       <b>-fdump-analyzer-stderr</b>
           Dump  internal  details  about  what  the  analyzer  is  doing  to  stderr.   This  option  overrides
           <b>-fdump-analyzer</b>.

       <b>-fdump-analyzer-callgraph</b>
           Dump a representation of the call graph suitable for viewing with GraphViz to <u>file.callgraph.dot</u>.

       <b>-fdump-analyzer-exploded-graph</b>
           Dump  a  representation  of  the  "exploded graph" suitable for viewing with GraphViz to <u>file.eg.dot</u>.
           Nodes are color-coded based on state-machine states to emphasize state changes.

       <b>-fdump-analyzer-exploded-nodes</b>
           Emit diagnostics showing where nodes in the "exploded graph" are in relation to the program source.

       <b>-fdump-analyzer-exploded-nodes-2</b>
           Dump a textual representation of the "exploded graph" to <u>file.eg.txt</u>.

       <b>-fdump-analyzer-exploded-nodes-3</b>
           Dump a textual representation of the "exploded graph" to one dump file per node,  to  <u>file.eg-id.txt</u>.
           This is typically a large number of dump files.

       <b>-fdump-analyzer-feasibility</b>
           Dump  internal  details about the analyzer's search for feasible paths.  The details are written in a
           form suitable for viewing with GraphViz to filenames of the form <u>file.*.fg.dot</u> and <u>file.*.tg.dot</u>.

       <b>-fdump-analyzer-json</b>
           Dump a compressed JSON representation of analyzer internals to  <u>file.analyzer.json.gz</u>.   The  precise
           format is subject to change.

       <b>-fdump-analyzer-state-purge</b>
           As  per  <b>-fdump-analyzer-supergraph</b>,  dump  a representation of the "supergraph" suitable for viewing
           with GraphViz, but annotate the graph with information on what state will be  purged  at  each  node.
           The graph is written to <u>file.state-purge.dot</u>.

       <b>-fdump-analyzer-supergraph</b>
           Dump  representations  of  the "supergraph" suitable for viewing with GraphViz to <u>file.supergraph.dot</u>
           and to <u>file.supergraph-eg.dot</u>.  These show all of the  control  flow  graphs  in  the  program,  with
           interprocedural  edges  for calls and returns.  The second dump contains annotations showing nodes in
           the "exploded graph" and diagnostics associated with them.

   <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>Debugging</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Program</b>
       To tell GCC to emit extra information for use by a debugger, in almost all cases you need only to add  <b>-g</b>
       to your other options.

       GCC  allows you to use <b>-g</b> with <b>-O</b>.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally be surprising:
       some variables you declared may not exist at all; flow of control may briefly  move  where  you  did  not
       expect  it; some statements may not be executed because they compute constant results or their values are
       already at hand; some statements may execute in different places because they  have  been  moved  out  of
       loops.   Nevertheless  it  is  possible  to  debug optimized output.  This makes it reasonable to use the
       optimizer for programs that might have bugs.

       If you are not using some other optimization option, consider using <b>-Og</b> with <b>-g</b>.  With no  <b>-O</b>  option  at
       all,  some  compiler  passes that collect information useful for debugging do not run at all, so that <b>-Og</b>
       may result in a better debugging experience.

       <b>-g</b>  Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format (stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF).
           GDB can work with this debugging information.

           On most systems that use stabs format, <b>-g</b> enables use of extra debugging information  that  only  GDB
           can use; this extra information makes debugging work better in GDB but probably makes other debuggers
           crash  or  refuse  to  read  the program.  If you want to control for certain whether to generate the
           extra information, use <b>-gstabs+</b>, <b>-gstabs</b>, <b>-gxcoff+</b>, <b>-gxcoff</b>, or <b>-gvms</b> (see below).

       <b>-ggdb</b>
           Produce debugging information for use by GDB.  This means to use the most expressive format available
           (DWARF, stabs, or the native format if neither of those are supported), including GDB  extensions  if
           at all possible.

       <b>-gdwarf</b>
       <b>-gdwarf-</b><u>version</u>
           Produce  debugging  information  in DWARF format (if that is supported).  The value of <u>version</u> may be
           either 2, 3, 4 or 5; the default version for most targets is 5 (with the exception  of  VxWorks,  TPF
           and Darwin/Mac OS X, which default to version 2, and AIX, which defaults to version 4).

           Note  that  with  DWARF  Version  2,  some  ports require and always use some non-conflicting DWARF 3
           extensions in the unwind tables.

           Version 4 may require GDB 7.0 and <b>-fvar-tracking-assignments</b> for maximum benefit. Version 5  requires
           GDB 8.0 or higher.

           GCC  no  longer  supports DWARF Version 1, which is substantially different than Version 2 and later.
           For historical reasons, some other  DWARF-related  options  such  as  <b>-fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm</b>)  retain  a
           reference to DWARF Version 2 in their names, but apply to all currently-supported versions of DWARF.

       <b>-gstabs</b>
           Produce  debugging  information in stabs format (if that is supported), without GDB extensions.  This
           is the format used by DBX on most BSD systems.  On MIPS, Alpha and System V Release  4  systems  this
           option  produces stabs debugging output that is not understood by DBX.  On System V Release 4 systems
           this option requires the GNU assembler.

       <b>-gstabs+</b>
           Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported), using GNU extensions understood
           only by the GNU debugger (GDB).  The use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers  crash
           or refuse to read the program.

       <b>-gxcoff</b>
           Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is supported).  This is the format used by the
           DBX debugger on IBM RS/6000 systems.

       <b>-gxcoff+</b>
           Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is supported), using GNU extensions understood
           only  by the GNU debugger (GDB).  The use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash
           or refuse to read the program, and may cause assemblers other than the GNU assembler  (GAS)  to  fail
           with an error.

       <b>-gvms</b>
           Produce  debugging  information in Alpha/VMS debug format (if that is supported).  This is the format
           used by DEBUG on Alpha/VMS systems.

       <b>-g</b><u>level</u>
       <b>-ggdb</b><u>level</u>
       <b>-gstabs</b><u>level</u>
       <b>-gxcoff</b><u>level</u>
       <b>-gvms</b><u>level</u>
           Request debugging information and also use <u>level</u> to specify how much information.  The default  level
           is 2.

           Level 0 produces no debug information at all.  Thus, <b>-g0</b> negates <b>-g</b>.

           Level  1  produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces in parts of the program that you
           don't plan to debug.  This includes descriptions of functions and external variables, and line number
           tables, but no information about local variables.

           Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro definitions present in the  program.   Some
           debuggers support macro expansion when you use <b>-g3</b>.

           If  you  use multiple <b>-g</b> options, with or without level numbers, the last such option is the one that
           is effective.

           <b>-gdwarf</b> does not accept a concatenated debug level, to avoid confusion with  <b>-gdwarf-</b><u>level</u>.   Instead
           use an additional <b>-g</b><u>level</u> option to change the debug level for DWARF.

       <b>-fno-eliminate-unused-debug-symbols</b>
           By  default, no debug information is produced for symbols that are not actually used. Use this option
           if you want debug information for all symbols.

       <b>-femit-class-debug-always</b>
           Instead of emitting debugging information for a C++ class in only one object file,  emit  it  in  all
           object  files  using  the  class.   This option should be used only with debuggers that are unable to
           handle the way GCC normally emits  debugging  information  for  classes  because  using  this  option
           increases the size of debugging information by as much as a factor of two.

       <b>-fno-merge-debug-strings</b>
           Direct  the  linker  to not merge together strings in the debugging information that are identical in
           different object files.  Merging is not supported by all assemblers or  linkers.   Merging  decreases
           the  size of the debug information in the output file at the cost of increasing link processing time.
           Merging is enabled by default.

       <b>-fdebug-prefix-map=</b><u>old</u><b>=</b><u>new</u>
           When compiling files residing in directory <u>old</u>, record debugging information describing  them  as  if
           the  files  resided  in directory <u>new</u> instead.  This can be used to replace a build-time path with an
           install-time path in the debug info.  It can also be used to change an absolute path  to  a  relative
           path by using <u>.</u> for <u>new</u>.  This can give more reproducible builds, which are location independent, but
           may require an extra command to tell GDB where to find the source files. See also <b>-ffile-prefix-map</b>.

       <b>-fvar-tracking</b>
           Run variable tracking pass.  It computes where variables are stored at each position in code.  Better
           debugging  information  is  then  generated  (if  the  debugging  information  format  supports  this
           information).

           It is enabled by default when compiling with optimization (<b>-Os</b>, <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, ...), debugging  information
           (<b>-g</b>) and the debug info format supports it.

       <b>-fvar-tracking-assignments</b>
           Annotate  assignments to user variables early in the compilation and attempt to carry the annotations
           over throughout the compilation all the way to the end, in an attempt to  improve  debug  information
           while optimizing.  Use of <b>-gdwarf-4</b> is recommended along with it.

           It  can  be  enabled  even  if  var-tracking  is  disabled, in which case annotations are created and
           maintained, but discarded at the end.  By default, this flag is enabled together with <b>-fvar-tracking</b>,
           except when selective scheduling is enabled.

       <b>-gsplit-dwarf</b>
           If DWARF debugging information is enabled, separate as much debugging information as possible into  a
           separate  output  file with the extension <u>.dwo</u>.  This option allows the build system to avoid linking
           files with debug information.  To be useful, this option requires a debugger capable of reading  <u>.dwo</u>
           files.

       <b>-gdwarf32</b>
       <b>-gdwarf64</b>
           If  DWARF  debugging  information  is  enabled, the <b>-gdwarf32</b> selects the 32-bit DWARF format and the
           <b>-gdwarf64</b> selects the 64-bit DWARF format.  The default is target specific, on  most  targets  it  is
           <b>-gdwarf32</b>  though.   The  32-bit  DWARF  format is smaller, but can't support more than 2GiB of debug
           information in any of the DWARF debug information sections.  The 64-bit DWARF  format  allows  larger
           debug information and might not be well supported by all consumers yet.

       <b>-gdescribe-dies</b>
           Add  description  attributes  to  some  DWARF  DIEs  that  have no name attribute, such as artificial
           variables, external references and call site parameter DIEs.

       <b>-gpubnames</b>
           Generate DWARF ".debug_pubnames" and ".debug_pubtypes" sections.

       <b>-ggnu-pubnames</b>
           Generate ".debug_pubnames" and ".debug_pubtypes" sections in a format suitable for conversion into  a
           GDB index.  This option is only useful with a linker that can produce GDB index version 7.

       <b>-fdebug-types-section</b>
           When  using  DWARF  Version  4  or higher, type DIEs can be put into their own ".debug_types" section
           instead of making them part of the ".debug_info" section.  It is more efficient  to  put  them  in  a
           separate  comdat  section  since  the linker can then remove duplicates.  But not all DWARF consumers
           support ".debug_types" sections yet and on some objects ".debug_types"  produces  larger  instead  of
           smaller debugging information.

       <b>-grecord-gcc-switches</b>
       <b>-gno-record-gcc-switches</b>
           This  switch  causes  the  command-line  options  used  to  invoke  the compiler that may affect code
           generation to be appended to the  DW_AT_producer  attribute  in  DWARF  debugging  information.   The
           options  are  concatenated with spaces separating them from each other and from the compiler version.
           It is enabled by default.  See also <b>-frecord-gcc-switches</b> for another way of storing compiler options
           into the object file.

       <b>-gstrict-dwarf</b>
           Disallow using extensions of later DWARF standard version than  selected  with  <b>-gdwarf-</b><u>version</u>.   On
           most targets using non-conflicting DWARF extensions from later standard versions is allowed.

       <b>-gno-strict-dwarf</b>
           Allow using extensions of later DWARF standard version than selected with <b>-gdwarf-</b><u>version</u>.

       <b>-gas-loc-support</b>
           Inform  the  compiler  that  the  assembler supports ".loc" directives.  It may then use them for the
           assembler to generate DWARF2+ line number tables.

           This is generally desirable, because assembler-generated line-number tables are a  lot  more  compact
           than those the compiler can generate itself.

           This  option will be enabled by default if, at GCC configure time, the assembler was found to support
           such directives.

       <b>-gno-as-loc-support</b>
           Force GCC to generate DWARF2+ line number tables internally, if DWARF2+ line number tables are to  be
           generated.

       <b>-gas-locview-support</b>
           Inform  the  compiler  that  the assembler supports "view" assignment and reset assertion checking in
           ".loc" directives.

           This option will be enabled by default if, at GCC configure time, the assembler was found to  support
           them.

       <b>-gno-as-locview-support</b>
           Force GCC to assign view numbers internally, if <b>-gvariable-location-views</b> are explicitly requested.

       <b>-gcolumn-info</b>
       <b>-gno-column-info</b>
           Emit  location  column  information into DWARF debugging information, rather than just file and line.
           This option is enabled by default.

       <b>-gstatement-frontiers</b>
       <b>-gno-statement-frontiers</b>
           This option causes GCC to  create  markers  in  the  internal  representation  at  the  beginning  of
           statements,  and to keep them roughly in place throughout compilation, using them to guide the output
           of "is_stmt" markers in the line number table.  This  is  enabled  by  default  when  compiling  with
           optimization (<b>-Os</b>, <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, ...), and outputting DWARF 2 debug information at the normal level.

       <b>-gvariable-location-views</b>
       <b>-gvariable-location-views=incompat5</b>
       <b>-gno-variable-location-views</b>
           Augment  variable  location  lists  with progressive view numbers implied from the line number table.
           This enables debug information consumers to inspect state at certain points of the program,  even  if
           no instructions associated with the corresponding source locations are present at that point.  If the
           assembler  lacks support for view numbers in line number tables, this will cause the compiler to emit
           the line number table, which generally makes them somewhat less compact.  The augmented  line  number
           tables and location lists are fully backward-compatible, so they can be consumed by debug information
           consumers  that  are  not  aware  of these augmentations, but they won't derive any benefit from them
           either.

           This is enabled by default when outputting DWARF 2 debug information at the normal level, as long  as
           there  is  assembler  support, <b>-fvar-tracking-assignments</b> is enabled and <b>-gstrict-dwarf</b> is not.  When
           assembler support is not available, this may still be enabled,  but  it  will  force  GCC  to  output
           internal  line  number  tables, and if <b>-ginternal-reset-location-views</b> is not enabled, that will most
           certainly lead to silently mismatching location views.

           There is a proposed representation for view numbers that is not backward compatible with the location
           list format introduced in DWARF 5, that  can  be  enabled  with  <b>-gvariable-location-views=incompat5</b>.
           This  option  may  be  removed  in  the future, is only provided as a reference implementation of the
           proposed representation.  Debug information consumers are  not  expected  to  support  this  extended
           format, and they would be rendered unable to decode location lists using it.

       <b>-ginternal-reset-location-views</b>
       <b>-gno-internal-reset-location-views</b>
           Attempt  to determine location views that can be omitted from location view lists.  This requires the
           compiler to have very accurate insn length estimates, which isn't always the case, and it  may  cause
           incorrect  view lists to be generated silently when using an assembler that does not support location
           view lists.  The GNU assembler will flag any such error as a "view number mismatch".   This  is  only
           enabled on ports that define a reliable estimation function.

       <b>-ginline-points</b>
       <b>-gno-inline-points</b>
           Generate  extended  debug  information  for  inlined  functions.   Location view tracking markers are
           inserted at inlined entry points, so that address and view numbers can  be  computed  and  output  in
           debug  information.   This  can  be  enabled  independently of location views, in which case the view
           numbers won't be output, but it can only be enabled along with statement frontiers, and  it  is  only
           enabled by default if location views are enabled.

       <b>-gz</b>[<b>=</b><u>type</u>]
           Produce  compressed  debug sections in DWARF format, if that is supported.  If <u>type</u> is not given, the
           default type depends on the capabilities of the assembler and linker used.  <u>type</u> may be one  of  <b>none</b>
           (don't  compress  debug  sections),  <b>zlib</b> (use zlib compression in ELF gABI format), or <b>zlib-gnu</b> (use
           zlib compression in traditional GNU format).  If the linker doesn't support writing compressed  debug
           sections, the option is rejected.  Otherwise, if the assembler does not support them, <b>-gz</b> is silently
           ignored when producing object files.

       <b>-femit-struct-debug-baseonly</b>
           Emit  debug  information for struct-like types only when the base name of the compilation source file
           matches the base name of file in which the struct is defined.

           This option substantially reduces the size of debugging information,  but  at  significant  potential
           loss  in  type  information  to  the debugger.  See <b>-femit-struct-debug-reduced</b> for a less aggressive
           option.  See <b>-femit-struct-debug-detailed</b> for more detailed control.

           This option works only with DWARF debug output.

       <b>-femit-struct-debug-reduced</b>
           Emit debug information for struct-like types only when the base name of the compilation  source  file
           matches  the  base  name  of  file  in  which the type is defined, unless the struct is a template or
           defined in a system header.

           This option significantly reduces the size of debugging information, with some potential loss in type
           information to the debugger.  See <b>-femit-struct-debug-baseonly</b> for a  more  aggressive  option.   See
           <b>-femit-struct-debug-detailed</b> for more detailed control.

           This option works only with DWARF debug output.

       <b>-femit-struct-debug-detailed</b>[<b>=</b><u>spec-list</u>]
           Specify  the  struct-like types for which the compiler generates debug information.  The intent is to
           reduce duplicate struct debug information between different object files within the same program.

           This option is a detailed version of  <b>-femit-struct-debug-reduced</b>  and  <b>-femit-struct-debug-baseonly</b>,
           which serves for most needs.

           A specification has the syntax[<b>dir:</b>|<b>ind:</b>][<b>ord:</b>|<b>gen:</b>](<b>any</b>|<b>sys</b>|<b>base</b>|<b>none</b>)

           The  optional  first  word  limits the specification to structs that are used directly (<b>dir:</b>) or used
           indirectly (<b>ind:</b>).  A struct type is used directly when  it  is  the  type  of  a  variable,  member.
           Indirect uses arise through pointers to structs.  That is, when use of an incomplete struct is valid,
           the use is indirect.  An example is <b>struct</b> <b>one</b> <b>direct;</b> <b>struct</b> <b>two</b> <b>*</b> <b>indirect;</b>.

           The  optional  second  word  limits  the  specification to ordinary structs (<b>ord:</b>) or generic structs
           (<b>gen:</b>).  Generic structs are  a  bit  complicated  to  explain.   For  C++,  these  are  non-explicit
           specializations  of  template  classes,  or non-template classes within the above.  Other programming
           languages have generics, but <b>-femit-struct-debug-detailed</b> does not yet implement them.

           The third word specifies the source files for those structs for which the compiler should emit  debug
           information.  The values <b>none</b> and <b>any</b> have the normal meaning.  The value <b>base</b> means that the base of
           name  of  the  file in which the type declaration appears must match the base of the name of the main
           compilation file.  In practice, this means that when compiling <u>foo.c</u>, debug information is  generated
           for  types  declared  in  that file and <u>foo.h</u>, but not other header files.  The value <b>sys</b> means those
           types satisfying <b>base</b> or declared in system or compiler headers.

           You may need to experiment to determine the best settings for your application.

           The default is <b>-femit-struct-debug-detailed=all</b>.

           This option works only with DWARF debug output.

       <b>-fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm</b>
           Emit DWARF unwind info as compiler generated  ".eh_frame"  section  instead  of  using  GAS  ".cfi_*"
           directives.

       <b>-fno-eliminate-unused-debug-types</b>
           Normally,  when  producing  DWARF output, GCC avoids producing debug symbol output for types that are
           nowhere used in the source file being compiled.  Sometimes it is useful to have  GCC  emit  debugging
           information  for  all  types  declared  in  a compilation unit, regardless of whether or not they are
           actually used in that compilation unit, for example if, in the debugger, you want to cast a value  to
           a  type  that  is  not  actually  used  in your program (but is declared).  More often, however, this
           results in a significant amount of wasted space.

   <b>Options</b> <b>That</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Optimization</b>
       These options control various sorts of optimizations.

       Without any optimization option, the compiler's goal is to reduce the cost of  compilation  and  to  make
       debugging  produce  the  expected  results.   Statements  are independent: if you stop the program with a
       breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to any  variable  or  change  the  program
       counter  to  any  other  statement in the function and get exactly the results you expect from the source
       code.

       Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve the performance and/or code  size  at
       the expense of compilation time and possibly the ability to debug the program.

       The  compiler  performs  optimization  based  on the knowledge it has of the program.  Compiling multiple
       files at once to a single output file mode allows the compiler to use information gained from all of  the
       files when compiling each of them.

       Not  all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag.  Only optimizations that have a flag are listed
       in this section.

       Most optimizations are completely disabled at <b>-O0</b> or if an <b>-O</b> level is not set on the command line,  even
       if individual optimization flags are specified.  Similarly, <b>-Og</b> suppresses many optimization passes.

       Depending  on  the  target  and  how GCC was configured, a slightly different set of optimizations may be
       enabled at each <b>-O</b> level than those listed here.  You can invoke GCC with <b>-Q</b>  <b>--help=optimizers</b>  to  find
       out the exact set of optimizations that are enabled at each level.

       <b>-O</b>
       <b>-O1</b> Optimize.   Optimizing  compilation  takes  somewhat  more  time,  and  a lot more memory for a large
           function.

           With <b>-O</b>, the compiler  tries  to  reduce  code  size  and  execution  time,  without  performing  any
           optimizations that take a great deal of compilation time.

           <b>-O</b> turns on the following optimization flags:

           <b>-fauto-inc-dec</b>  <b>-fbranch-count-reg</b> <b>-fcombine-stack-adjustments</b> <b>-fcompare-elim</b> <b>-fcprop-registers</b> <b>-fdce</b>
           <b>-fdefer-pop</b> <b>-fdelayed-branch</b>  <b>-fdse</b>  <b>-fforward-propagate</b>  <b>-fguess-branch-probability</b>  <b>-fif-conversion</b>
           <b>-fif-conversion2</b>    <b>-finline-functions-called-once</b>    <b>-fipa-modref</b>   <b>-fipa-profile</b>   <b>-fipa-pure-const</b>
           <b>-fipa-reference</b>      <b>-fipa-reference-addressable</b>       <b>-fmerge-constants</b>       <b>-fmove-loop-invariants</b>
           <b>-fomit-frame-pointer</b>   <b>-freorder-blocks</b>   <b>-fshrink-wrap</b>   <b>-fshrink-wrap-separate</b>   <b>-fsplit-wide-types</b>
           <b>-fssa-backprop</b> <b>-fssa-phiopt</b> <b>-ftree-bit-ccp</b> <b>-ftree-ccp</b> <b>-ftree-ch</b> <b>-ftree-coalesce-vars</b> <b>-ftree-copy-prop</b>
           <b>-ftree-dce</b> <b>-ftree-dominator-opts</b>  <b>-ftree-dse</b>  <b>-ftree-forwprop</b>  <b>-ftree-fre</b>  <b>-ftree-phiprop</b>  <b>-ftree-pta</b>
           <b>-ftree-scev-cprop</b> <b>-ftree-sink</b> <b>-ftree-slsr</b> <b>-ftree-sra</b> <b>-ftree-ter</b> <b>-funit-at-a-time</b>

       <b>-O2</b> Optimize  even  more.   GCC  performs nearly all supported optimizations that do not involve a space-
           speed tradeoff.  As compared to <b>-O</b>, this option increases both compilation time and  the  performance
           of the generated code.

           <b>-O2</b>  turns  on  all  optimization flags specified by <b>-O</b>.  It also turns on the following optimization
           flags:

           <b>-falign-functions</b>   <b>-falign-jumps</b>  <b>-falign-labels</b>    <b>-falign-loops</b>   <b>-fcaller-saves</b>   <b>-fcode-hoisting</b>

           <b>-fdevirtualize-speculatively</b>    <b>-fexpensive-optimizations</b>    <b>-ffinite-loops</b>     <b>-fgcse</b>      <b>-fgcse-lm</b>
           <b>-fhoist-adjacent-loads</b>  <b>-finline-functions</b>  <b>-finline-small-functions</b> <b>-findirect-inlining</b> <b>-fipa-bit-cp</b>
           <b>-fipa-cp</b>  <b>-fipa-icf</b> <b>-fipa-ra</b>  <b>-fipa-sra</b>  <b>-fipa-vrp</b> <b>-fisolate-erroneous-paths-dereference</b>  <b>-flra-remat</b>
           <b>-foptimize-sibling-calls</b>           <b>-foptimize-strlen</b>          <b>-fpartial-inlining</b>          <b>-fpeephole2</b>
           <b>-freorder-blocks-algorithm=stc</b>          <b>-freorder-blocks-and-partition</b>            <b>-freorder-functions</b>
           <b>-frerun-cse-after-loop</b>    <b>-fschedule-insns</b>     <b>-fschedule-insns2</b>   <b>-fsched-interblock</b>    <b>-fsched-spec</b>
           <b>-fstore-merging</b>     <b>-fstrict-aliasing</b>     <b>-fthread-jumps</b>      <b>-ftree-builtin-call-dce</b>      <b>-ftree-pre</b>
           <b>-ftree-switch-conversion</b>  <b>-ftree-tail-merge</b> <b>-ftree-vrp</b>

           Please note the warning under <b>-fgcse</b> about invoking <b>-O2</b> on programs that use computed gotos.

           NOTE:  In  Ubuntu  8.10  and later versions, <b>-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2</b>, in Ubuntu 24.04 and later versions,
           <b>-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3</b>, is set by default, and is activated when <b>-O</b> is set to 2 or higher.  This enables
           additional compile-time and run-time checks for several libc functions.  To disable,  specify  either
           <b>-U_FORTIFY_SOURCE</b> or <b>-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=0</b>.

       <b>-O3</b> Optimize  yet  more.  <b>-O3</b> turns on all optimizations specified by <b>-O2</b> and also turns on the following
           optimization flags:

           <b>-fgcse-after-reload</b>    <b>-fipa-cp-clone</b>    <b>-floop-interchange</b>    <b>-floop-unroll-and-jam</b>     <b>-fpeel-loops</b>
           <b>-fpredictive-commoning</b>  <b>-fsplit-loops</b>  <b>-fsplit-paths</b>  <b>-ftree-loop-distribution</b>  <b>-ftree-loop-vectorize</b>
           <b>-ftree-partial-pre</b> <b>-ftree-slp-vectorize</b> <b>-funswitch-loops</b> <b>-fvect-cost-model</b>  <b>-fvect-cost-model=dynamic</b>
           <b>-fversion-loops-for-strides</b>

       <b>-O0</b> Reduce compilation time and make debugging produce the expected results.  This is the default.

       <b>-Os</b> Optimize for size.  <b>-Os</b> enables all <b>-O2</b> optimizations except those that often increase code size:

           <b>-falign-functions</b>      <b>-falign-jumps</b>     <b>-falign-labels</b>      <b>-falign-loops</b>     <b>-fprefetch-loop-arrays</b>
           <b>-freorder-blocks-algorithm=stc</b>

           It also enables <b>-finline-functions</b>, causes the compiler to tune for code size rather  than  execution
           speed, and performs further optimizations designed to reduce code size.

       <b>-Ofast</b>
           Disregard  strict  standards  compliance.   <b>-Ofast</b>  enables  all  <b>-O3</b> optimizations.  It also enables
           optimizations that are not valid for all  standard-compliant  programs.   It  turns  on  <b>-ffast-math</b>,
           <b>-fallow-store-data-races</b>  and  the  Fortran-specific  <b>-fstack-arrays</b>,  unless <b>-fmax-stack-var-size</b> is
           specified, and <b>-fno-protect-parens</b>.

       <b>-Og</b> Optimize debugging experience.  <b>-Og</b> should be the optimization level of choice for the standard edit-
           compile-debug cycle, offering a reasonable level of optimization while maintaining  fast  compilation
           and  a  good  debugging  experience.   It  is  a better choice than <b>-O0</b> for producing debuggable code
           because some compiler passes that collect debug information are disabled at <b>-O0</b>.

           Like <b>-O0</b>, <b>-Og</b> completely disables  a  number  of  optimization  passes  so  that  individual  options
           controlling  them  have no effect.  Otherwise <b>-Og</b> enables all <b>-O1</b> optimization flags except for those
           that may interfere with debugging:

           <b>-fbranch-count-reg</b>        <b>-fdelayed-branch</b>       <b>-fdse</b>        <b>-fif-conversion</b>        <b>-fif-conversion2</b>
           <b>-finline-functions-called-once</b>   <b>-fmove-loop-invariants</b>    <b>-fssa-phiopt</b>   <b>-ftree-bit-ccp</b>   <b>-ftree-dse</b>
           <b>-ftree-pta</b>  <b>-ftree-sra</b>

       If you use multiple <b>-O</b> options, with or without level numbers, the last such option is the  one  that  is
       effective.

       Options of the form <b>-f</b><u>flag</u> specify machine-independent flags.  Most flags have both positive and negative
       forms; the negative form of <b>-ffoo</b> is <b>-fno-foo</b>.  In the table below, only one of the forms is listed---the
       one you typically use.  You can figure out the other form by either removing <b>no-</b> or adding it.

       The  following  options  control  specific optimizations.  They are either activated by <b>-O</b> options or are
       related to ones that are.  You can use the following flags  in  the  rare  cases  when  "fine-tuning"  of
       optimizations to be performed is desired.

       <b>-fno-defer-pop</b>
           For  machines that must pop arguments after a function call, always pop the arguments as soon as each
           function returns.  At levels <b>-O1</b> and higher, <b>-fdefer-pop</b> is the default; this allows the compiler  to
           let arguments accumulate on the stack for several function calls and pop them all at once.

       <b>-fforward-propagate</b>
           Perform  a forward propagation pass on RTL.  The pass tries to combine two instructions and checks if
           the result can be simplified.  If loop unrolling is active, two passes are performed and  the  second
           is scheduled after loop unrolling.

           This option is enabled by default at optimization levels <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-ffp-contract=</b><u>style</u>
           <b>-ffp-contract=off</b>   disables   floating-point  expression  contraction.   <b>-ffp-contract=fast</b>  enables
           floating-point expression contraction such as forming of fused multiply-add operations if the  target
           has  native  support  for  them.   <b>-ffp-contract=on</b>  enables floating-point expression contraction if
           allowed by  the  language  standard.   This  is  currently  not  implemented  and  treated  equal  to
           <b>-ffp-contract=off</b>.

           The default is <b>-ffp-contract=fast</b>.

       <b>-fomit-frame-pointer</b>
           Omit  the  frame pointer in functions that don't need one.  This avoids the instructions to save, set
           up and restore the frame pointer; on many targets it also makes an extra register available.

           On some targets this flag has no effect because the standard calling sequence  always  uses  a  frame
           pointer, so it cannot be omitted.

           Note  that  <b>-fno-omit-frame-pointer</b>  doesn't  guarantee  the  frame pointer is used in all functions.
           Several targets always omit the frame pointer in leaf functions.

           Enabled by default at <b>-O</b> and higher.

       <b>-foptimize-sibling-calls</b>
           Optimize sibling and tail recursive calls.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-foptimize-strlen</b>
           Optimize various standard C  string  functions  (e.g.  "strlen",  "strchr"  or  "strcpy")  and  their
           "_FORTIFY_SOURCE" counterparts into faster alternatives.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>.

       <b>-fno-inline</b>
           Do  not expand any functions inline apart from those marked with the "always_inline" attribute.  This
           is the default when not optimizing.

           Single functions can be exempted from inlining by marking them with the "noinline" attribute.

       <b>-finline-small-functions</b>
           Integrate functions into their callers when their body is smaller than expected  function  call  code
           (so  overall  size  of program gets smaller).  The compiler heuristically decides which functions are
           simple enough to be worth integrating in this way.  This inlining  applies  to  all  functions,  even
           those not declared inline.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-findirect-inlining</b>
           Inline  also  indirect  calls  that  are  discovered  to  be known at compile time thanks to previous
           inlining.   This  option  has  any  effect  only  when  inlining  itself  is   turned   on   by   the
           <b>-finline-functions</b> or <b>-finline-small-functions</b> options.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-finline-functions</b>
           Consider  all  functions  for  inlining,  even  if  they  are  not  declared  inline.   The  compiler
           heuristically decides which functions are worth integrating in this way.

           If all calls to a given function are integrated, and the function  is  declared  "static",  then  the
           function is normally not output as assembler code in its own right.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.  Also enabled by <b>-fprofile-use</b> and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-finline-functions-called-once</b>
           Consider  all  "static"  functions  called  once  for inlining into their caller even if they are not
           marked "inline".  If a call to a given function is integrated, then the function  is  not  output  as
           assembler code in its own right.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O1</b>, <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b> and <b>-Os</b>, but not <b>-Og</b>.

       <b>-fearly-inlining</b>
           Inline  functions  marked by "always_inline" and functions whose body seems smaller than the function
           call overhead early before doing <b>-fprofile-generate</b> instrumentation and real inlining pass.  Doing so
           makes profiling significantly cheaper and usually inlining faster on programs having large chains  of
           nested wrapper functions.

           Enabled by default.

       <b>-fipa-sra</b>
           Perform   interprocedural  scalar  replacement  of  aggregates,  removal  of  unused  parameters  and
           replacement of parameters passed by reference by parameters passed by value.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b> and <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-finline-limit=</b><u>n</u>
           By default, GCC limits the size of functions that can be inlined.  This flag allows coarse control of
           this limit.  <u>n</u> is the size of functions that can be inlined in number of pseudo instructions.

           Inlining is actually controlled by a number of parameters, which may  be  specified  individually  by
           using <b>--param</b> <u>name</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>.  The <b>-finline-limit=</b><u>n</u> option sets some of these parameters as follows:

           <b>max-inline-insns-single</b>
               is set to <u>n</u>/2.

           <b>max-inline-insns-auto</b>
               is set to <u>n</u>/2.

           See  below for a documentation of the individual parameters controlling inlining and for the defaults
           of these parameters.

           <u>Note:</u> there may be no value to <b>-finline-limit</b> that results in default behavior.

           <u>Note:</u> pseudo  instruction  represents,  in  this  particular  context,  an  abstract  measurement  of
           function's  size.  In no way does it represent a count of assembly instructions and as such its exact
           meaning might change from one release to an another.

       <b>-fno-keep-inline-dllexport</b>
           This is a more fine-grained version of <b>-fkeep-inline-functions</b>, which applies only to functions  that
           are declared using the "dllexport" attribute or declspec.

       <b>-fkeep-inline-functions</b>
           In  C,  emit "static" functions that are declared "inline" into the object file, even if the function
           has been inlined into all of its callers.  This switch does not affect functions  using  the  "extern
           inline" extension in GNU C90.  In C++, emit any and all inline functions into the object file.

       <b>-fkeep-static-functions</b>
           Emit "static" functions into the object file, even if the function is never used.

       <b>-fkeep-static-consts</b>
           Emit  variables  declared  "static  const"  when  optimization isn't turned on, even if the variables
           aren't referenced.

           GCC enables this option by default.  If you want to force the compiler to  check  if  a  variable  is
           referenced,  regardless  of whether or not optimization is turned on, use the <b>-fno-keep-static-consts</b>
           option.

       <b>-fmerge-constants</b>
           Attempt  to  merge  identical  constants  (string  constants  and  floating-point  constants)  across
           compilation units.

           This  option  is  the  default for optimized compilation if the assembler and linker support it.  Use
           <b>-fno-merge-constants</b> to inhibit this behavior.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fmerge-all-constants</b>
           Attempt to merge identical constants and identical variables.

           This option implies <b>-fmerge-constants</b>.  In addition to <b>-fmerge-constants</b>  this  considers  e.g.  even
           constant  initialized arrays or initialized constant variables with integral or floating-point types.
           Languages like C or C++ require each variable, including multiple instances of the same  variable  in
           recursive calls, to have distinct locations, so using this option results in non-conforming behavior.

       <b>-fmodulo-sched</b>
           Perform  swing  modulo  scheduling  immediately before the first scheduling pass.  This pass looks at
           innermost loops and reorders their instructions by overlapping different iterations.

       <b>-fmodulo-sched-allow-regmoves</b>
           Perform more aggressive SMS-based modulo scheduling with register moves  allowed.   By  setting  this
           flag  certain anti-dependences edges are deleted, which triggers the generation of reg-moves based on
           the life-range analysis.  This option is effective only with <b>-fmodulo-sched</b> enabled.

       <b>-fno-branch-count-reg</b>
           Disable the optimization pass that scans for opportunities to use "decrement and branch" instructions
           on a count register instead of instruction sequences that decrement a register,  compare  it  against
           zero,  and  then  branch based upon the result.  This option is only meaningful on architectures that
           support  such  instructions,  which  include  x86,  PowerPC,  IA-64  and  S/390.    Note   that   the
           <b>-fno-branch-count-reg</b>  option doesn't remove the decrement and branch instructions from the generated
           instruction stream introduced by other optimization passes.

           The default is <b>-fbranch-count-reg</b> at <b>-O1</b> and higher, except for <b>-Og</b>.

       <b>-fno-function-cse</b>
           Do not put function addresses in registers; make each instruction  that  calls  a  constant  function
           contain the function's address explicitly.

           This  option  results  in less efficient code, but some strange hacks that alter the assembler output
           may be confused by the optimizations performed when this option is not used.

           The default is <b>-ffunction-cse</b>

       <b>-fno-zero-initialized-in-bss</b>
           If the target supports a BSS section, GCC by default puts variables that are initialized to zero into
           BSS.  This can save space in the resulting code.

           This option turns off this behavior because some programs explicitly rely on variables going  to  the
           data  section---e.g.,  so that the resulting executable can find the beginning of that section and/or
           make assumptions based on that.

           The default is <b>-fzero-initialized-in-bss</b>.

       <b>-fthread-jumps</b>
           Perform optimizations that check to see if a jump branches to a  location  where  another  comparison
           subsumed  by  the first is found.  If so, the first branch is redirected to either the destination of
           the second branch or a point immediately following it, depending on whether the condition is known to
           be true or false.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fsplit-wide-types</b>
           When using a type that occupies multiple registers, such as "long long" on a 32-bit system, split the
           registers apart and allocate them independently.  This  normally  generates  better  code  for  those
           types, but may make debugging more difficult.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fsplit-wide-types-early</b>
           Fully   split   wide  types  early,  instead  of  very  late.   This  option  has  no  effect  unless
           <b>-fsplit-wide-types</b> is turned on.

           This is the default on some targets.

       <b>-fcse-follow-jumps</b>
           In common subexpression elimination (CSE), scan through jump instructions when the target of the jump
           is not reached by any other path.  For example, when CSE encounters an "if" statement with an  "else"
           clause, CSE follows the jump when the condition tested is false.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fcse-skip-blocks</b>
           This  is  similar  to <b>-fcse-follow-jumps</b>, but causes CSE to follow jumps that conditionally skip over
           blocks.  When CSE encounters a simple "if" statement with no else  clause,  <b>-fcse-skip-blocks</b>  causes
           CSE to follow the jump around the body of the "if".

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-frerun-cse-after-loop</b>
           Re-run common subexpression elimination after loop optimizations are performed.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fgcse</b>
           Perform  a global common subexpression elimination pass.  This pass also performs global constant and
           copy propagation.

           <u>Note:</u> When compiling a program using computed gotos, a GCC extension, you  may  get  better  run-time
           performance  if  you  disable the global common subexpression elimination pass by adding <b>-fno-gcse</b> to
           the command line.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fgcse-lm</b>
           When <b>-fgcse-lm</b> is enabled, global common subexpression elimination attempts to move  loads  that  are
           only  killed  by  stores  into themselves.  This allows a loop containing a load/store sequence to be
           changed to a load outside the loop, and a copy/store within the loop.

           Enabled by default when <b>-fgcse</b> is enabled.

       <b>-fgcse-sm</b>
           When <b>-fgcse-sm</b> is enabled, a store motion pass is run after global common subexpression  elimination.
           This  pass  attempts  to  move  stores  out of loops.  When used in conjunction with <b>-fgcse-lm</b>, loops
           containing a load/store sequence can be changed to a load before the loop and a store after the loop.

           Not enabled at any optimization level.

       <b>-fgcse-las</b>
           When <b>-fgcse-las</b> is enabled, the global common subexpression  elimination  pass  eliminates  redundant
           loads that come after stores to the same memory location (both partial and full redundancies).

           Not enabled at any optimization level.

       <b>-fgcse-after-reload</b>
           When  <b>-fgcse-after-reload</b>  is  enabled,  a redundant load elimination pass is performed after reload.
           The purpose of this pass is to clean up redundant spilling.

           Enabled by <b>-fprofile-use</b> and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-faggressive-loop-optimizations</b>
           This option tells the loop optimizer to use language constraints to derive bounds for the  number  of
           iterations  of a loop.  This assumes that loop code does not invoke undefined behavior by for example
           causing signed integer overflows or out-of-bound array  accesses.   The  bounds  for  the  number  of
           iterations  of  a loop are used to guide loop unrolling and peeling and loop exit test optimizations.
           This option is enabled by default.

       <b>-funconstrained-commons</b>
           This option tells the compiler that variables declared in common blocks (e.g. Fortran) may  later  be
           overridden  with  longer  trailing arrays. This prevents certain optimizations that depend on knowing
           the array bounds.

       <b>-fcrossjumping</b>
           Perform cross-jumping transformation.  This transformation unifies equivalent  code  and  saves  code
           size.  The resulting code may or may not perform better than without cross-jumping.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fauto-inc-dec</b>
           Combine  increments  or decrements of addresses with memory accesses.  This pass is always skipped on
           architectures that do not have instructions to support this.  Enabled by default at <b>-O</b> and higher  on
           architectures that support this.

       <b>-fdce</b>
           Perform dead code elimination (DCE) on RTL.  Enabled by default at <b>-O</b> and higher.

       <b>-fdse</b>
           Perform dead store elimination (DSE) on RTL.  Enabled by default at <b>-O</b> and higher.

       <b>-fif-conversion</b>
           Attempt  to  transform  conditional  jumps  into  branch-less  equivalents.   This  includes  use  of
           conditional moves, min, max, set flags and abs instructions,  and  some  tricks  doable  by  standard
           arithmetics.   The  use  of  conditional  execution  on  chips where it is available is controlled by
           <b>-fif-conversion2</b>.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, but not with <b>-Og</b>.

       <b>-fif-conversion2</b>
           Use  conditional  execution  (where  available)  to  transform  conditional  jumps  into  branch-less
           equivalents.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, but not with <b>-Og</b>.

       <b>-fdeclone-ctor-dtor</b>
           The  C++  ABI  requires  multiple  entry  points  for  constructors  and  destructors: one for a base
           subobject, one for a complete object, and one for a virtual destructor  that  calls  operator  delete
           afterwards.   For  a  hierarchy  with virtual bases, the base and complete variants are clones, which
           means two copies of the function.  With this option, the base and complete variants are changed to be
           thunks that call a common implementation.

           Enabled by <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fdelete-null-pointer-checks</b>
           Assume that programs cannot safely dereference null pointers,  and  that  no  code  or  data  element
           resides  at  address  zero.   This  option  enables  simple  constant  folding  optimizations  at all
           optimization levels.  In addition, other optimization passes in GCC use this flag to  control  global
           dataflow  analyses that eliminate useless checks for null pointers; these assume that a memory access
           to address zero always results in a trap, so that if a pointer is checked after it has  already  been
           dereferenced, it cannot be null.

           Note    however    that    in    some    environments    this    assumption   is   not   true.    Use
           <b>-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks</b> to disable  this  optimization  for  programs  that  depend  on  that
           behavior.

           This  option  is  enabled  by  default on most targets.  On Nios II ELF, it defaults to off.  On AVR,
           CR16, and MSP430, this option is completely disabled.

           Passes that use the dataflow information are enabled independently at different optimization levels.

       <b>-fdevirtualize</b>
           Attempt to convert calls to virtual functions to direct calls.  This is done both within a  procedure
           and interprocedurally as part of indirect inlining (<b>-findirect-inlining</b>) and interprocedural constant
           propagation (<b>-fipa-cp</b>).  Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fdevirtualize-speculatively</b>
           Attempt  to convert calls to virtual functions to speculative direct calls.  Based on the analysis of
           the type inheritance graph, determine for a given call the set of  likely  targets.  If  the  set  is
           small,  preferably of size 1, change the call into a conditional deciding between direct and indirect
           calls.  The speculative calls enable more optimizations, such as inlining.  When  they  seem  useless
           after further optimization, they are converted back into original form.

       <b>-fdevirtualize-at-ltrans</b>
           Stream  extra information needed for aggressive devirtualization when running the link-time optimizer
           in local transformation mode.  This option enables more devirtualization but significantly  increases
           the size of streamed data. For this reason it is disabled by default.

       <b>-fexpensive-optimizations</b>
           Perform a number of minor optimizations that are relatively expensive.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-free</b>
           Attempt  to  remove  redundant  extension  instructions.   This  is especially helpful for the x86-64
           architecture, which implicitly zero-extends in 64-bit registers after writing to their  lower  32-bit
           half.

           Enabled for Alpha, AArch64 and x86 at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fno-lifetime-dse</b>
           In  C++  the value of an object is only affected by changes within its lifetime: when the constructor
           begins, the object has an indeterminate value, and any changes during the lifetime of the object  are
           dead  when  the object is destroyed.  Normally dead store elimination will take advantage of this; if
           your code relies on the value of the object storage persisting beyond the lifetime of the object, you
           can use this flag to disable this optimization.  To preserve stores  before  the  constructor  starts
           (e.g.  because  your operator new clears the object storage) but still treat the object as dead after
           the destructor, you can use <b>-flifetime-dse=1</b>.  The default behavior can be explicitly  selected  with
           <b>-flifetime-dse=2</b>.  <b>-flifetime-dse=0</b> is equivalent to <b>-fno-lifetime-dse</b>.

       <b>-flive-range-shrinkage</b>
           Attempt  to  decrease  register  pressure through register live range shrinkage.  This is helpful for
           fast processors with small or moderate size register sets.

       <b>-fira-algorithm=</b><u>algorithm</u>
           Use the specified coloring algorithm for the integrated register allocator.  The  <u>algorithm</u>  argument
           can  be  <b>priority</b>,  which  specifies  Chow's priority coloring, or <b>CB</b>, which specifies Chaitin-Briggs
           coloring.  Chaitin-Briggs coloring is not implemented for all architectures, but  for  those  targets
           that do support it, it is the default because it generates better code.

       <b>-fira-region=</b><u>region</u>
           Use  specified  regions  for the integrated register allocator.  The <u>region</u> argument should be one of
           the following:

           <b>all</b> Use all loops as register allocation regions.  This can give the best results for machines with a
               small and/or irregular register set.

           <b>mixed</b>
               Use all loops except for loops with small register pressure as the regions.  This  value  usually
               gives  the  best results in most cases and for most architectures, and is enabled by default when
               compiling with optimization for speed (<b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, ...).

           <b>one</b> Use all functions as a single region.  This typically results in the smallest code size,  and  is
               enabled by default for <b>-Os</b> or <b>-O0</b>.

       <b>-fira-hoist-pressure</b>
           Use  IRA  to evaluate register pressure in the code hoisting pass for decisions to hoist expressions.
           This option usually results in smaller code, but it can slow the compiler down.

           This option is enabled at level <b>-Os</b> for all targets.

       <b>-fira-loop-pressure</b>
           Use IRA to evaluate register pressure in loops for decisions to move loop  invariants.   This  option
           usually results in generation of faster and smaller code on machines with large register files (&gt;= 32
           registers), but it can slow the compiler down.

           This option is enabled at level <b>-O3</b> for some targets.

       <b>-fno-ira-share-save-slots</b>
           Disable  sharing of stack slots used for saving call-used hard registers living through a call.  Each
           hard register gets a separate stack slot, and as a result function stack frames are larger.

       <b>-fno-ira-share-spill-slots</b>
           Disable sharing of stack slots allocated for pseudo-registers.  Each pseudo-register  that  does  not
           get a hard register gets a separate stack slot, and as a result function stack frames are larger.

       <b>-flra-remat</b>
           Enable  CFG-sensitive  rematerialization  in  LRA.  Instead of loading values of spilled pseudos, LRA
           tries to rematerialize (recalculate) values if it is profitable.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fdelayed-branch</b>
           If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder instructions  to  exploit  instruction  slots
           available after delayed branch instructions.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, but not at <b>-Og</b>.

       <b>-fschedule-insns</b>
           If  supported  for  the target machine, attempt to reorder instructions to eliminate execution stalls
           due to required data being unavailable.  This helps machines that have slow floating point or  memory
           load  instructions  by  allowing  other  instructions  to  be  issued until the result of the load or
           floating-point instruction is required.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>.

       <b>-fschedule-insns2</b>
           Similar to <b>-fschedule-insns</b>, but requests an additional pass of instruction scheduling after register
           allocation has been done.  This is especially useful on machines with a relatively  small  number  of
           registers and where memory load instructions take more than one cycle.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fno-sched-interblock</b>
           Disable  instruction scheduling across basic blocks, which is normally enabled when scheduling before
           register allocation, i.e.  with <b>-fschedule-insns</b> or at <b>-O2</b> or higher.

       <b>-fno-sched-spec</b>
           Disable speculative motion of non-load instructions, which is normally enabled when scheduling before
           register allocation, i.e.  with <b>-fschedule-insns</b> or at <b>-O2</b> or higher.

       <b>-fsched-pressure</b>
           Enable register pressure sensitive insn scheduling before register allocation.  This only makes sense
           when scheduling before register allocation is enabled,  i.e.  with  <b>-fschedule-insns</b>  or  at  <b>-O2</b>  or
           higher.   Usage  of  this  option  can improve the generated code and decrease its size by preventing
           register pressure increase above the number of available hard  registers  and  subsequent  spills  in
           register allocation.

       <b>-fsched-spec-load</b>
           Allow  speculative  motion  of  some load instructions.  This only makes sense when scheduling before
           register allocation, i.e. with <b>-fschedule-insns</b> or at <b>-O2</b> or higher.

       <b>-fsched-spec-load-dangerous</b>
           Allow speculative motion of more load instructions.  This only makes  sense  when  scheduling  before
           register allocation, i.e. with <b>-fschedule-insns</b> or at <b>-O2</b> or higher.

       <b>-fsched-stalled-insns</b>
       <b>-fsched-stalled-insns=</b><u>n</u>
           Define  how  many  insns  (if  any) can be moved prematurely from the queue of stalled insns into the
           ready list during the second scheduling pass.  <b>-fno-sched-stalled-insns</b> means that no insns are moved
           prematurely, <b>-fsched-stalled-insns=0</b> means there is no limit on how many queued insns  can  be  moved
           prematurely.  <b>-fsched-stalled-insns</b> without a value is equivalent to <b>-fsched-stalled-insns=1</b>.

       <b>-fsched-stalled-insns-dep</b>
       <b>-fsched-stalled-insns-dep=</b><u>n</u>
           Define  how  many  insn  groups  (cycles)  are  examined for a dependency on a stalled insn that is a
           candidate for premature removal from the queue of stalled insns.  This has an effect only during  the
           second  scheduling  pass, and only if <b>-fsched-stalled-insns</b> is used.  <b>-fno-sched-stalled-insns-dep</b> is
           equivalent to <b>-fsched-stalled-insns-dep=0</b>.  <b>-fsched-stalled-insns-dep</b> without a value  is  equivalent
           to <b>-fsched-stalled-insns-dep=1</b>.

       <b>-fsched2-use-superblocks</b>
           When  scheduling  after  register  allocation,  use superblock scheduling.  This allows motion across
           basic block boundaries, resulting in faster schedules.  This  option  is  experimental,  as  not  all
           machine  descriptions  used  by GCC model the CPU closely enough to avoid unreliable results from the
           algorithm.

           This only makes sense when scheduling after register allocation, i.e. with  <b>-fschedule-insns2</b>  or  at
           <b>-O2</b> or higher.

       <b>-fsched-group-heuristic</b>
           Enable the group heuristic in the scheduler.  This heuristic favors the instruction that belongs to a
           schedule group.  This is enabled by default when scheduling is enabled, i.e. with <b>-fschedule-insns</b> or
           <b>-fschedule-insns2</b> or at <b>-O2</b> or higher.

       <b>-fsched-critical-path-heuristic</b>
           Enable  the  critical-path  heuristic  in  the  scheduler.  This heuristic favors instructions on the
           critical path.  This is enabled by default when scheduling is enabled, i.e. with <b>-fschedule-insns</b>  or
           <b>-fschedule-insns2</b> or at <b>-O2</b> or higher.

       <b>-fsched-spec-insn-heuristic</b>
           Enable  the  speculative  instruction  heuristic in the scheduler.  This heuristic favors speculative
           instructions with greater dependency weakness.   This  is  enabled  by  default  when  scheduling  is
           enabled, i.e.  with <b>-fschedule-insns</b> or <b>-fschedule-insns2</b> or at <b>-O2</b> or higher.

       <b>-fsched-rank-heuristic</b>
           Enable  the  rank  heuristic  in the scheduler.  This heuristic favors the instruction belonging to a
           basic block with greater size or frequency.  This is enabled by default when scheduling  is  enabled,
           i.e.  with <b>-fschedule-insns</b> or <b>-fschedule-insns2</b> or at <b>-O2</b> or higher.

       <b>-fsched-last-insn-heuristic</b>
           Enable  the  last-instruction heuristic in the scheduler.  This heuristic favors the instruction that
           is less dependent on the last instruction scheduled.  This is enabled by default when  scheduling  is
           enabled, i.e. with <b>-fschedule-insns</b> or <b>-fschedule-insns2</b> or at <b>-O2</b> or higher.

       <b>-fsched-dep-count-heuristic</b>
           Enable  the  dependent-count  heuristic in the scheduler.  This heuristic favors the instruction that
           has more instructions depending on it.  This is enabled by default when scheduling is  enabled,  i.e.
           with <b>-fschedule-insns</b> or <b>-fschedule-insns2</b> or at <b>-O2</b> or higher.

       <b>-freschedule-modulo-scheduled-loops</b>
           Modulo  scheduling  is performed before traditional scheduling.  If a loop is modulo scheduled, later
           scheduling passes may change its schedule.  Use this option to control that behavior.

       <b>-fselective-scheduling</b>
           Schedule instructions using selective scheduling algorithm.  Selective scheduling runs instead of the
           first scheduler pass.

       <b>-fselective-scheduling2</b>
           Schedule instructions using selective scheduling algorithm.  Selective scheduling runs instead of the
           second scheduler pass.

       <b>-fsel-sched-pipelining</b>
           Enable software pipelining of innermost loops during selective scheduling.  This option has no effect
           unless one of <b>-fselective-scheduling</b> or <b>-fselective-scheduling2</b> is turned on.

       <b>-fsel-sched-pipelining-outer-loops</b>
           When pipelining loops during selective scheduling, also pipeline outer loops.   This  option  has  no
           effect unless <b>-fsel-sched-pipelining</b> is turned on.

       <b>-fsemantic-interposition</b>
           Some  object  formats, like ELF, allow interposing of symbols by the dynamic linker.  This means that
           for symbols exported from the DSO, the compiler cannot perform interprocedural propagation,  inlining
           and  other  optimizations in anticipation that the function or variable in question may change. While
           this feature is  useful,  for  example,  to  rewrite  memory  allocation  functions  by  a  debugging
           implementation,  it  is expensive in the terms of code quality.  With <b>-fno-semantic-interposition</b> the
           compiler assumes that if interposition happens for  functions  the  overwriting  function  will  have
           precisely  the  same semantics (and side effects).  Similarly if interposition happens for variables,
           the constructor of the variable will be the same. The flag has no  effect  for  functions  explicitly
           declared  inline  (where  it  is never allowed for interposition to change semantics) and for symbols
           explicitly declared weak.

       <b>-fshrink-wrap</b>
           Emit function prologues only before parts of the function that need it, rather than at the top of the
           function.  This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O</b> and higher.

       <b>-fshrink-wrap-separate</b>
           Shrink-wrap separate parts of the prologue and epilogue separately, so  that  those  parts  are  only
           executed  when  needed.  This option is on by default, but has no effect unless <b>-fshrink-wrap</b> is also
           turned on and the target supports this.

       <b>-fcaller-saves</b>
           Enable allocation of values to registers that are clobbered by  function  calls,  by  emitting  extra
           instructions  to save and restore the registers around such calls.  Such allocation is done only when
           it seems to result in better code.

           This option is always enabled by default on certain machines,  usually  those  which  have  no  call-
           preserved registers to use instead.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fcombine-stack-adjustments</b>
           Tracks stack adjustments (pushes and pops) and stack memory references and then tries to find ways to
           combine them.

           Enabled by default at <b>-O1</b> and higher.

       <b>-fipa-ra</b>
           Use  caller save registers for allocation if those registers are not used by any called function.  In
           that case it is not necessary to save and restore them around calls.  This is only possible if called
           functions are part of same compilation unit as current function and they are compiled before it.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>,  <b>-O3</b>,  <b>-Os</b>,  however  the  option  is  disabled  if  generated  code  will  be
           instrumented  for  profiling (<b>-p</b>, or <b>-pg</b>) or if callee's register usage cannot be known exactly (this
           happens on targets that do not expose prologues and epilogues in RTL).

       <b>-fconserve-stack</b>
           Attempt to minimize stack usage.  The compiler attempts to use less stack space, even if  that  makes
           the  program  slower.   This  option  implies  setting the <b>large-stack-frame</b> parameter to 100 and the
           <b>large-stack-frame-growth</b> parameter to 400.

       <b>-ftree-reassoc</b>
           Perform reassociation on trees.  This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O</b> and higher.

       <b>-fcode-hoisting</b>
           Perform code hoisting.  Code hoisting tries to move the evaluation of  expressions  executed  on  all
           paths  to  the  function  exit  as  early  as  possible.   This  is  especially useful as a code size
           optimization, but it often helps for code speed as well.  This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O2</b>  and
           higher.

       <b>-ftree-pre</b>
           Perform  partial  redundancy  elimination (PRE) on trees.  This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O2</b> and
           <b>-O3</b>.

       <b>-ftree-partial-pre</b>
           Make partial redundancy elimination (PRE) more aggressive.  This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O3</b>.

       <b>-ftree-forwprop</b>
           Perform forward propagation on trees.  This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O</b> and higher.

       <b>-ftree-fre</b>
           Perform full redundancy elimination (FRE) on trees.  The difference between FRE and PRE is  that  FRE
           only considers expressions that are computed on all paths leading to the redundant computation.  This
           analysis  is  faster than PRE, though it exposes fewer redundancies.  This flag is enabled by default
           at <b>-O</b> and higher.

       <b>-ftree-phiprop</b>
           Perform hoisting of loads from conditional pointers on trees.  This pass is enabled by default at  <b>-O</b>
           and higher.

       <b>-fhoist-adjacent-loads</b>
           Speculatively  hoist  loads  from  both  branches  of  an if-then-else if the loads are from adjacent
           locations in the same structure and the target architecture has a conditional move instruction.  This
           flag is enabled by default at <b>-O2</b> and higher.

       <b>-ftree-copy-prop</b>
           Perform copy propagation on trees.  This pass eliminates unnecessary copy operations.  This  flag  is
           enabled by default at <b>-O</b> and higher.

       <b>-fipa-pure-const</b>
           Discover which functions are pure or constant.  Enabled by default at <b>-O</b> and higher.

       <b>-fipa-reference</b>
           Discover  which  static  variables  do not escape the compilation unit.  Enabled by default at <b>-O</b> and
           higher.

       <b>-fipa-reference-addressable</b>
           Discover read-only, write-only and non-addressable static variables.  Enabled by default  at  <b>-O</b>  and
           higher.

       <b>-fipa-stack-alignment</b>
           Reduce stack alignment on call sites if possible.  Enabled by default.

       <b>-fipa-pta</b>
           Perform  interprocedural  pointer  analysis  and interprocedural modification and reference analysis.
           This option can cause excessive memory and compile-time usage on large compilation units.  It is  not
           enabled by default at any optimization level.

       <b>-fipa-profile</b>
           Perform  interprocedural  profile  propagation.   The  functions  called only from cold functions are
           marked as cold. Also functions executed once (such as  "cold",  "noreturn",  static  constructors  or
           destructors)  are  identified. Cold functions and loop less parts of functions executed once are then
           optimized for size.  Enabled by default at <b>-O</b> and higher.

       <b>-fipa-modref</b>
           Perform interprocedural mod/ref analysis.  This optimization analyzes the side effects  of  functions
           (memory  locations  that  are  modified  or  referenced)  and  enables better optimization across the
           function call boundary.  This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O</b> and higher.

       <b>-fipa-cp</b>
           Perform interprocedural constant propagation.  This optimization analyzes the  program  to  determine
           when  values passed to functions are constants and then optimizes accordingly.  This optimization can
           substantially increase performance if the application has constants passed to functions.   This  flag
           is enabled by default at <b>-O2</b>, <b>-Os</b> and <b>-O3</b>.  It is also enabled by <b>-fprofile-use</b> and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-fipa-cp-clone</b>
           Perform  function  cloning  to  make  interprocedural  constant  propagation stronger.  When enabled,
           interprocedural constant propagation performs function cloning when externally visible  function  can
           be  called  with  constant  arguments.   Because  this  optimization  can  create  multiple copies of
           functions, it may significantly increase code size (see <b>--param</b> <b>ipa-cp-unit-growth=</b><u>value</u>).  This flag
           is enabled by default at <b>-O3</b>.  It is also enabled by <b>-fprofile-use</b> and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-fipa-bit-cp</b>
           When enabled, perform interprocedural bitwise constant propagation. This flag is enabled  by  default
           at <b>-O2</b> and by <b>-fprofile-use</b> and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.  It requires that <b>-fipa-cp</b> is enabled.

       <b>-fipa-vrp</b>
           When enabled, perform interprocedural propagation of value ranges. This flag is enabled by default at
           <b>-O2</b>. It requires that <b>-fipa-cp</b> is enabled.

       <b>-fipa-icf</b>
           Perform  Identical Code Folding for functions and read-only variables.  The optimization reduces code
           size and may disturb unwind stacks by replacing a function by equivalent one with a  different  name.
           The optimization works more effectively with link-time optimization enabled.

           Although  the  behavior  is similar to the Gold Linker's ICF optimization, GCC ICF works on different
           levels and thus the optimizations are not same - there are equivalences that are found  only  by  GCC
           and equivalences found only by Gold.

           This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O2</b> and <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-flive-patching=</b><u>level</u>
           Control GCC's optimizations to produce output suitable for live-patching.

           If  the  compiler's  optimization  uses  a  function's body or information extracted from its body to
           optimize/change another function, the latter is called an impacted function  of  the  former.   If  a
           function is patched, its impacted functions should be patched too.

           The  impacted functions are determined by the compiler's interprocedural optimizations.  For example,
           a caller is impacted when inlining a function into its caller, cloning a function  and  changing  its
           caller  to call this new clone, or extracting a function's pureness/constness information to optimize
           its direct or indirect callers, etc.

           Usually, the more IPA optimizations enabled, the larger the number of  impacted  functions  for  each
           function.   In  order to control the number of impacted functions and more easily compute the list of
           impacted function, IPA optimizations can be partially enabled at two different levels.

           The <u>level</u> argument should be one of the following:

           <b>inline-clone</b>
               Only enable inlining and cloning optimizations, which includes inlining, cloning, interprocedural
               scalar replacement of aggregates and partial inlining.  As a result, when  patching  a  function,
               all its callers and its clones' callers are impacted, therefore need to be patched as well.

               <b>-flive-patching=inline-clone</b>   disables   the   following   optimization  flags:  <b>-fwhole-program</b>
               <b>-fipa-pta</b>   <b>-fipa-reference</b>    <b>-fipa-ra</b>   <b>-fipa-icf</b>    <b>-fipa-icf-functions</b>    <b>-fipa-icf-variables</b>
               <b>-fipa-bit-cp</b>    <b>-fipa-vrp</b>   <b>-fipa-pure-const</b>   <b>-fipa-reference-addressable</b>  <b>-fipa-stack-alignment</b>
               <b>-fipa-modref</b>

           <b>inline-only-static</b>
               Only enable inlining of static functions.  As a result, when patching a static function, all  its
               callers are impacted and so need to be patched as well.

               In     addition    to    all    the    flags    that    <b>-flive-patching=inline-clone</b>    disables,
               <b>-flive-patching=inline-only-static</b>  disables  the  following   additional   optimization   flags:
               <b>-fipa-cp-clone</b>  <b>-fipa-sra</b>  <b>-fpartial-inlining</b>  <b>-fipa-cp</b>

           When <b>-flive-patching</b> is specified without any value, the default value is <u>inline-clone</u>.

           This flag is disabled by default.

           Note that <b>-flive-patching</b> is not supported with link-time optimization (<b>-flto</b>).

       <b>-fisolate-erroneous-paths-dereference</b>
           Detect  paths  that  trigger  erroneous  or  undefined  behavior due to dereferencing a null pointer.
           Isolate those paths from the main control flow and turn the statement  with  erroneous  or  undefined
           behavior  into  a  trap.   This  flag  is  enabled  by  default  at  <b>-O2</b>  and  higher  and depends on
           <b>-fdelete-null-pointer-checks</b> also being enabled.

       <b>-fisolate-erroneous-paths-attribute</b>
           Detect paths that trigger erroneous or undefined behavior due to a null value being  used  in  a  way
           forbidden  by  a "returns_nonnull" or "nonnull" attribute.  Isolate those paths from the main control
           flow and turn the statement with erroneous or undefined behavior into a trap.  This is not  currently
           enabled, but may be enabled by <b>-O2</b> in the future.

       <b>-ftree-sink</b>
           Perform forward store motion on trees.  This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O</b> and higher.

       <b>-ftree-bit-ccp</b>
           Perform  sparse  conditional  bit  constant  propagation  on  trees  and  propagate pointer alignment
           information.  This pass only operates on local scalar variables and is enabled by default at <b>-O1</b>  and
           higher, except for <b>-Og</b>.  It requires that <b>-ftree-ccp</b> is enabled.

       <b>-ftree-ccp</b>
           Perform  sparse  conditional  constant  propagation (CCP) on trees.  This pass only operates on local
           scalar variables and is enabled by default at <b>-O</b> and higher.

       <b>-fssa-backprop</b>
           Propagate information about uses of a value  up  the  definition  chain  in  order  to  simplify  the
           definitions.   For  example,  this  pass strips sign operations if the sign of a value never matters.
           The flag is enabled by default at <b>-O</b> and higher.

       <b>-fssa-phiopt</b>
           Perform pattern matching on SSA PHI nodes to optimize conditional code.   This  pass  is  enabled  by
           default at <b>-O1</b> and higher, except for <b>-Og</b>.

       <b>-ftree-switch-conversion</b>
           Perform  conversion  of  simple  initializations  in a switch to initializations from a scalar array.
           This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O2</b> and higher.

       <b>-ftree-tail-merge</b>
           Look for identical code sequences.  When  found,  replace  one  with  a  jump  to  the  other.   This
           optimization  is  known as tail merging or cross jumping.  This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O2</b> and
           higher.  The compilation time in this pass can be limited using <b>max-tail-merge-comparisons</b>  parameter
           and <b>max-tail-merge-iterations</b> parameter.

       <b>-ftree-dce</b>
           Perform dead code elimination (DCE) on trees.  This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O</b> and higher.

       <b>-ftree-builtin-call-dce</b>
           Perform  conditional dead code elimination (DCE) for calls to built-in functions that may set "errno"
           but are otherwise free of side effects.  This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O2</b> and higher if <b>-Os</b>  is
           not also specified.

       <b>-ffinite-loops</b>
           Assume that a loop with an exit will eventually take the exit and not loop indefinitely.  This allows
           the  compiler  to  remove loops that otherwise have no side-effects, not considering eventual endless
           looping as such.

           This option is enabled by default at <b>-O2</b> for C++ with -std=c++11 or higher.

       <b>-ftree-dominator-opts</b>
           Perform a variety of simple scalar cleanups (constant/copy propagation, redundancy elimination, range
           propagation and expression simplification) based on a dominator tree traversal.  This  also  performs
           jump threading (to reduce jumps to jumps). This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O</b> and higher.

       <b>-ftree-dse</b>
           Perform  dead  store elimination (DSE) on trees.  A dead store is a store into a memory location that
           is later overwritten by another store without any intervening loads.  In this case the earlier  store
           can be deleted.  This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O</b> and higher.

       <b>-ftree-ch</b>
           Perform  loop  header  copying on trees.  This is beneficial since it increases effectiveness of code
           motion optimizations.  It also saves one jump.  This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O</b> and higher.  It
           is not enabled for <b>-Os</b>, since it usually increases code size.

       <b>-ftree-loop-optimize</b>
           Perform loop optimizations on trees.  This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O</b> and higher.

       <b>-ftree-loop-linear</b>
       <b>-floop-strip-mine</b>
       <b>-floop-block</b>
           Perform loop nest optimizations.  Same as <b>-floop-nest-optimize</b>.  To use this code transformation, GCC
           has to be configured with <b>--with-isl</b> to enable the Graphite loop transformation infrastructure.

       <b>-fgraphite-identity</b>
           Enable the identity  transformation  for  graphite.   For  every  SCoP  we  generate  the  polyhedral
           representation  and transform it back to gimple.  Using <b>-fgraphite-identity</b> we can check the costs or
           benefits of the GIMPLE -&gt; GRAPHITE -&gt; GIMPLE transformation.  Some  minimal  optimizations  are  also
           performed by the code generator isl, like index splitting and dead code elimination in loops.

       <b>-floop-nest-optimize</b>
           Enable  the  isl based loop nest optimizer.  This is a generic loop nest optimizer based on the Pluto
           optimization algorithms.  It calculates a loop structure optimized for data-locality and parallelism.
           This option is experimental.

       <b>-floop-parallelize-all</b>
           Use the Graphite data dependence analysis to identify loops that can  be  parallelized.   Parallelize
           all  the  loops that can be analyzed to not contain loop carried dependences without checking that it
           is profitable to parallelize the loops.

       <b>-ftree-coalesce-vars</b>
           While transforming the program out of the SSA representation, attempt to reduce copying by coalescing
           versions of different user-defined  variables,  instead  of  just  compiler  temporaries.   This  may
           severely limit the ability to debug an optimized program compiled with <b>-fno-var-tracking-assignments</b>.
           In  the negated form, this flag prevents SSA coalescing of user variables.  This option is enabled by
           default if optimization is enabled, and it does very little otherwise.

       <b>-ftree-loop-if-convert</b>
           Attempt to transform conditional jumps in the innermost loops to branch-less equivalents.  The intent
           is to remove control-flow  from  the  innermost  loops  in  order  to  improve  the  ability  of  the
           vectorization pass to handle these loops.  This is enabled by default if vectorization is enabled.

       <b>-ftree-loop-distribution</b>
           Perform  loop  distribution.   This  flag  can improve cache performance on big loop bodies and allow
           further loop optimizations, like parallelization or vectorization, to take place.  For  example,  the
           loop

                   DO I = 1, N
                     A(I) = B(I) + C
                     D(I) = E(I) * F
                   ENDDO

           is transformed to

                   DO I = 1, N
                      A(I) = B(I) + C
                   ENDDO
                   DO I = 1, N
                      D(I) = E(I) * F
                   ENDDO

           This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O3</b>.  It is also enabled by <b>-fprofile-use</b> and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-ftree-loop-distribute-patterns</b>
           Perform  loop distribution of patterns that can be code generated with calls to a library.  This flag
           is enabled by default at <b>-O2</b> and higher, and by <b>-fprofile-use</b> and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

           This pass distributes the initialization loops and generates a call to memset zero.  For example, the
           loop

                   DO I = 1, N
                     A(I) = 0
                     B(I) = A(I) + I
                   ENDDO

           is transformed to

                   DO I = 1, N
                      A(I) = 0
                   ENDDO
                   DO I = 1, N
                      B(I) = A(I) + I
                   ENDDO

           and the initialization loop is transformed into a call to memset  zero.   This  flag  is  enabled  by
           default at <b>-O3</b>.  It is also enabled by <b>-fprofile-use</b> and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-floop-interchange</b>
           Perform  loop  interchange outside of graphite.  This flag can improve cache performance on loop nest
           and allow further loop optimizations, like vectorization, to take place.  For example, the loop

                   for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++)
                     for (int j = 0; j &lt; N; j++)
                       for (int k = 0; k &lt; N; k++)
                         c[i][j] = c[i][j] + a[i][k]*b[k][j];

           is transformed to

                   for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++)
                     for (int k = 0; k &lt; N; k++)
                       for (int j = 0; j &lt; N; j++)
                         c[i][j] = c[i][j] + a[i][k]*b[k][j];

           This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O3</b>.  It is also enabled by <b>-fprofile-use</b> and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-floop-unroll-and-jam</b>
           Apply unroll and jam transformations on feasible loops.  In a loop nest this unrolls the  outer  loop
           by some factor and fuses the resulting multiple inner loops.  This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O3</b>.
           It is also enabled by <b>-fprofile-use</b> and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-ftree-loop-im</b>
           Perform  loop  invariant motion on trees.  This pass moves only invariants that are hard to handle at
           RTL level  (function  calls,  operations  that  expand  to  nontrivial  sequences  of  insns).   With
           <b>-funswitch-loops</b>  it also moves operands of conditions that are invariant out of the loop, so that we
           can use just trivial invariantness analysis in  loop  unswitching.   The  pass  also  includes  store
           motion.

       <b>-ftree-loop-ivcanon</b>
           Create  a  canonical  counter  for  number  of  iterations  in  loops for which determining number of
           iterations requires complicated analysis.  Later optimizations then may determine the number  easily.
           Useful especially in connection with unrolling.

       <b>-ftree-scev-cprop</b>
           Perform  final  value  replacement.  If a variable is modified in a loop in such a way that its value
           when exiting the loop can be determined  using  only  its  initial  value  and  the  number  of  loop
           iterations, replace uses of the final value by such a computation, provided it is sufficiently cheap.
           This  reduces  data dependencies and may allow further simplifications.  Enabled by default at <b>-O</b> and
           higher.

       <b>-fivopts</b>
           Perform  induction  variable  optimizations  (strength  reduction,  induction  variable  merging  and
           induction variable elimination) on trees.

       <b>-ftree-parallelize-loops=n</b>
           Parallelize  loops, i.e., split their iteration space to run in n threads.  This is only possible for
           loops whose iterations are independent and can be arbitrarily reordered.  The  optimization  is  only
           profitable on multiprocessor machines, for loops that are CPU-intensive, rather than constrained e.g.
           by  memory  bandwidth.  This option implies <b>-pthread</b>, and thus is only supported on targets that have
           support for <b>-pthread</b>.

       <b>-ftree-pta</b>
           Perform function-local points-to analysis on trees.  This flag is  enabled  by  default  at  <b>-O1</b>  and
           higher, except for <b>-Og</b>.

       <b>-ftree-sra</b>
           Perform  scalar  replacement  of aggregates.  This pass replaces structure references with scalars to
           prevent committing structures to memory too early.  This flag  is  enabled  by  default  at  <b>-O1</b>  and
           higher, except for <b>-Og</b>.

       <b>-fstore-merging</b>
           Perform merging of narrow stores to consecutive memory addresses.  This pass merges contiguous stores
           of  immediate  values  narrower  than  a  word  into  fewer  wider  stores  to  reduce  the number of
           instructions.  This is enabled by default at <b>-O2</b> and higher as well as <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-ftree-ter</b>
           Perform temporary expression  replacement  during  the  SSA-&gt;normal  phase.   Single  use/single  def
           temporaries  are replaced at their use location with their defining expression.  This results in non-
           GIMPLE code, but gives the expanders much more complex trees to  work  on  resulting  in  better  RTL
           generation.  This is enabled by default at <b>-O</b> and higher.

       <b>-ftree-slsr</b>
           Perform  straight-line  strength  reduction  on trees.  This recognizes related expressions involving
           multiplications and replaces them by less expensive calculations when possible.  This is  enabled  by
           default at <b>-O</b> and higher.

       <b>-ftree-vectorize</b>
           Perform  vectorization  on trees. This flag enables <b>-ftree-loop-vectorize</b> and <b>-ftree-slp-vectorize</b> if
           not explicitly specified.

       <b>-ftree-loop-vectorize</b>
           Perform loop vectorization on trees. This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O3</b> and by  <b>-ftree-vectorize</b>,
           <b>-fprofile-use</b>, and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-ftree-slp-vectorize</b>
           Perform  basic  block  vectorization  on  trees.  This  flag  is  enabled  by  default  at <b>-O3</b> and by
           <b>-ftree-vectorize</b>, <b>-fprofile-use</b>, and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-fvect-cost-model=</b><u>model</u>
           Alter the cost model used for vectorization.  The <u>model</u> argument should be one of <b>unlimited</b>, <b>dynamic</b>,
           <b>cheap</b> or <b>very-cheap</b>.  With the <b>unlimited</b> model the vectorized code-path is assumed to  be  profitable
           while  with  the  <b>dynamic</b> model a runtime check guards the vectorized code-path to enable it only for
           iteration counts that will likely execute faster than when executing the original scalar  loop.   The
           <b>cheap</b>  model disables vectorization of loops where doing so would be cost prohibitive for example due
           to required runtime checks for data dependence or alignment but otherwise is  equal  to  the  <b>dynamic</b>
           model.   The <b>very-cheap</b> model only allows vectorization if the vector code would entirely replace the
           scalar code that is being vectorized.  For example, if each iteration of a vectorized loop would only
           be able to handle exactly four iterations of the scalar loop, the <b>very-cheap</b> model would  only  allow
           vectorization if the scalar iteration count is known to be a multiple of four.

           The default cost model depends on other optimization flags and is either <b>dynamic</b> or <b>cheap</b>.

       <b>-fsimd-cost-model=</b><u>model</u>
           Alter  the  cost  model  used  for vectorization of loops marked with the OpenMP simd directive.  The
           <u>model</u> argument should be one of <b>unlimited</b>, <b>dynamic</b>, <b>cheap</b>.  All values of <u>model</u> have the same meaning
           as described in <b>-fvect-cost-model</b> and by default a cost model defined with <b>-fvect-cost-model</b> is used.

       <b>-ftree-vrp</b>
           Perform Value Range Propagation on trees.  This is similar to  the  constant  propagation  pass,  but
           instead of values, ranges of values are propagated.  This allows the optimizers to remove unnecessary
           range  checks like array bound checks and null pointer checks.  This is enabled by default at <b>-O2</b> and
           higher.  Null pointer check elimination is only done if <b>-fdelete-null-pointer-checks</b> is enabled.

       <b>-fsplit-paths</b>
           Split paths  leading  to  loop  backedges.   This  can  improve  dead  code  elimination  and  common
           subexpression elimination.  This is enabled by default at <b>-O3</b> and above.

       <b>-fsplit-ivs-in-unroller</b>
           Enables  expression  of  values of induction variables in later iterations of the unrolled loop using
           the value in the first iteration.  This breaks long dependency chains, thus improving  efficiency  of
           the scheduling passes.

           A  combination  of <b>-fweb</b> and CSE is often sufficient to obtain the same effect.  However, that is not
           reliable in cases where the loop body is more complicated than a single basic block.   It  also  does
           not work at all on some architectures due to restrictions in the CSE pass.

           This optimization is enabled by default.

       <b>-fvariable-expansion-in-unroller</b>
           With this option, the compiler creates multiple copies of some local variables when unrolling a loop,
           which can result in superior code.

           This optimization is enabled by default for PowerPC targets, but disabled by default otherwise.

       <b>-fpartial-inlining</b>
           Inline  parts of functions.  This option has any effect only when inlining itself is turned on by the
           <b>-finline-functions</b> or <b>-finline-small-functions</b> options.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fpredictive-commoning</b>
           Perform predictive commoning optimization, i.e., reusing computations (especially  memory  loads  and
           stores) performed in previous iterations of loops.

           This option is enabled at level <b>-O3</b>.  It is also enabled by <b>-fprofile-use</b> and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-fprefetch-loop-arrays</b>
           If  supported  by  the  target  machine,  generate  instructions  to  prefetch  memory to improve the
           performance of loops that access large arrays.

           This option may generate better or worse code; results are highly dependent on the structure of loops
           within the source code.

           Disabled at level <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fno-printf-return-value</b>
           Do not substitute constants for known return value of formatted output functions such  as  "sprintf",
           "snprintf",  "vsprintf", and "vsnprintf" (but not "printf" of "fprintf").  This transformation allows
           GCC to optimize or even eliminate branches based on the known return value of these functions  called
           with  arguments  that  are  either  constant,  or  whose values are known to be in a range that makes
           determining the exact return value possible.  For example, when <b>-fprintf-return-value</b> is  in  effect,
           both  the  branch and the body of the "if" statement (but not the call to "snprint") can be optimized
           away when "i" is a 32-bit or smaller integer because the return value is guaranteed to be at most 8.

                   char buf[9];
                   if (snprintf (buf, "%08x", i) &gt;= sizeof buf)
                     ...

           The <b>-fprintf-return-value</b> option relies on other optimizations and yields best results with  <b>-O2</b>  and
           above.   It  works  in  tandem  with  the  <b>-Wformat-overflow</b>  and  <b>-Wformat-truncation</b>  options.  The
           <b>-fprintf-return-value</b> option is enabled by default.

       <b>-fno-peephole</b>
       <b>-fno-peephole2</b>
           Disable any machine-specific  peephole  optimizations.   The  difference  between  <b>-fno-peephole</b>  and
           <b>-fno-peephole2</b>  is  in  how  they are implemented in the compiler; some targets use one, some use the
           other, a few use both.

           <b>-fpeephole</b> is enabled by default.  <b>-fpeephole2</b> enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fno-guess-branch-probability</b>
           Do not guess branch probabilities using heuristics.

           GCC uses heuristics to guess branch probabilities if they are  not  provided  by  profiling  feedback
           (<b>-fprofile-arcs</b>).    These  heuristics  are  based  on  the  control  flow  graph.   If  some  branch
           probabilities are specified by "__builtin_expect", then the  heuristics  are  used  to  guess  branch
           probabilities  for  the  rest  of  the  control  flow  graph, taking the "__builtin_expect" info into
           account.  The interactions between the heuristics and "__builtin_expect" can be complex, and in  some
           cases,  it  may  be  useful  to  disable the heuristics so that the effects of "__builtin_expect" are
           easier to understand.

           It   is   also   possible   to   specify   expected    probability    of    the    expression    with
           "__builtin_expect_with_probability" built-in function.

           The default is <b>-fguess-branch-probability</b> at levels <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-freorder-blocks</b>
           Reorder basic blocks in the compiled function in order to reduce number of taken branches and improve
           code locality.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-freorder-blocks-algorithm=</b><u>algorithm</u>
           Use  the specified algorithm for basic block reordering.  The <u>algorithm</u> argument can be <b>simple</b>, which
           does not increase code size (except sometimes due to secondary effects like alignment), or  <b>stc</b>,  the
           "software trace cache" algorithm, which tries to put all often executed code together, minimizing the
           number of branches executed by making extra copies of code.

           The default is <b>simple</b> at levels <b>-O</b>, <b>-Os</b>, and <b>stc</b> at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>.

       <b>-freorder-blocks-and-partition</b>
           In  addition  to reordering basic blocks in the compiled function, in order to reduce number of taken
           branches, partitions hot and cold basic blocks into separate sections of the assembly and  <u>.o</u>  files,
           to improve paging and cache locality performance.

           This  optimization is automatically turned off in the presence of exception handling or unwind tables
           (on targets using setjump/longjump or target specific scheme), for linkonce sections,  for  functions
           with  a  user-defined section attribute and on any architecture that does not support named sections.
           When <b>-fsplit-stack</b> is used this option is not enabled by default (to avoid linker errors), but may be
           enabled explicitly (if using a working linker).

           Enabled for x86 at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-freorder-functions</b>
           Reorder functions in the object file in order to improve code locality.  This is implemented by using
           special subsections ".text.hot" for most  frequently  executed  functions  and  ".text.unlikely"  for
           unlikely  executed  functions.   Reordering  is done by the linker so object file format must support
           named sections and linker must place them in a reasonable way.

           This option isn't effective unless you  either  provide  profile  feedback  (see  <b>-fprofile-arcs</b>  for
           details) or manually annotate functions with "hot" or "cold" attributes.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fstrict-aliasing</b>
           Allow  the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules applicable to the language being compiled.
           For C (and C++), this activates optimizations based on the type of expressions.   In  particular,  an
           object  of  one type is assumed never to reside at the same address as an object of a different type,
           unless the types are almost the same.  For example, an "unsigned int" can alias an "int", but  not  a
           "void*" or a "double".  A character type may alias any other type.

           Pay special attention to code like this:

                   union a_union {
                     int i;
                     double d;
                   };

                   int f() {
                     union a_union t;
                     t.d = 3.0;
                     return t.i;
                   }

           The  practice  of reading from a different union member than the one most recently written to (called
           "type-punning") is common.  Even with <b>-fstrict-aliasing</b>, type-punning is allowed, provided the memory
           is accessed through the union type.  So, the code above works  as  expected.     However,  this  code
           might not:

                   int f() {
                     union a_union t;
                     int* ip;
                     t.d = 3.0;
                     ip = &amp;t.i;
                     return *ip;
                   }

           Similarly,  access  by taking the address, casting the resulting pointer and dereferencing the result
           has undefined behavior, even if the cast uses a union type, e.g.:

                   int f() {
                     double d = 3.0;
                     return ((union a_union *) &amp;d)-&gt;i;
                   }

           The <b>-fstrict-aliasing</b> option is enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-falign-functions</b>
       <b>-falign-functions=</b><u>n</u>
       <b>-falign-functions=</b><u>n</u><b>:</b><u>m</u>
       <b>-falign-functions=</b><u>n</u><b>:</b><u>m</u><b>:</b><u>n2</u>
       <b>-falign-functions=</b><u>n</u><b>:</b><u>m</u><b>:</b><u>n2</u><b>:</b><u>m2</u>
           Align the start of functions to the next power-of-two greater than or equal to <u>n</u>, skipping up to  <u>m</u>-1
           bytes.   This  ensures  that  at  least  the  first <u>m</u> bytes of the function can be fetched by the CPU
           without crossing an <u>n</u>-byte alignment boundary.

           If <u>m</u> is not specified, it defaults to <u>n</u>.

           Examples: <b>-falign-functions=32</b> aligns functions to the next  32-byte  boundary,  <b>-falign-functions=24</b>
           aligns  to  the  next  32-byte  boundary  only  if  this  can  be  done by skipping 23 bytes or less,
           <b>-falign-functions=32:7</b> aligns to the next 32-byte boundary only if this can be  done  by  skipping  6
           bytes or less.

           The    second   pair   of   <u>n2</u>:<u>m2</u>   values   allows   you   to   specify   a   secondary   alignment:
           <b>-falign-functions=64:7:32:3</b> aligns to the next 64-byte boundary if this can be  done  by  skipping  6
           bytes  or less, otherwise aligns to the next 32-byte boundary if this can be done by skipping 2 bytes
           or less.  If <u>m2</u> is not specified, it defaults to <u>n2</u>.

           Some assemblers only support this flag when <u>n</u> is a power of two; in that case, it is rounded up.

           <b>-fno-align-functions</b> and <b>-falign-functions=1</b> are equivalent and mean that functions are not aligned.

           If <u>n</u> is not specified or is zero, use a machine-dependent default.   The  maximum  allowed  <u>n</u>  option
           value is 65536.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>.

       <b>-flimit-function-alignment</b>
           If  this  option  is  enabled,  the  compiler tries to avoid unnecessarily overaligning functions. It
           attempts to instruct the assembler to align by the amount specified by <b>-falign-functions</b>, but not  to
           skip more bytes than the size of the function.

       <b>-falign-labels</b>
       <b>-falign-labels=</b><u>n</u>
       <b>-falign-labels=</b><u>n</u><b>:</b><u>m</u>
       <b>-falign-labels=</b><u>n</u><b>:</b><u>m</u><b>:</b><u>n2</u>
       <b>-falign-labels=</b><u>n</u><b>:</b><u>m</u><b>:</b><u>n2</u><b>:</b><u>m2</u>
           Align all branch targets to a power-of-two boundary.

           Parameters  of  this  option  are  analogous  to the <b>-falign-functions</b> option.  <b>-fno-align-labels</b> and
           <b>-falign-labels=1</b> are equivalent and mean that labels are not aligned.

           If <b>-falign-loops</b> or <b>-falign-jumps</b> are applicable and are greater than this value, then  their  values
           are used instead.

           If  <u>n</u>  is  not  specified  or  is zero, use a machine-dependent default which is very likely to be <b>1</b>,
           meaning no alignment.  The maximum allowed <u>n</u> option value is 65536.

       <b>-falign-loops=</b><u>n</u><b>:</b><u>m</u><b>:</b><u>n2</u><b>:</b><u>m2</u>
           Align loops to a power-of-two boundary.  If the loops are executed many times, this makes up for  any
           execution of the dummy padding instructions.

           If <b>-falign-labels</b> is greater than this value, then its value is used instead.

           Parameters  of  this  option  are  analogous  to  the <b>-falign-functions</b> option.  <b>-fno-align-loops</b> and
           <b>-falign-loops=1</b> are equivalent and mean that loops are not aligned.  The  maximum  allowed  <u>n</u>  option
           value is 65536.

           If <u>n</u> is not specified or is zero, use a machine-dependent default.

       <b>-falign-jumps=</b><u>n</u><b>:</b><u>m</u><b>:</b><u>n2</u><b>:</b><u>m2</u>
           Align  branch  targets  to  a power-of-two boundary, for branch targets where the targets can only be
           reached by jumping.  In this case, no dummy operations need be executed.

           If <b>-falign-labels</b> is greater than this value, then its value is used instead.

           Parameters of this option are  analogous  to  the  <b>-falign-functions</b>  option.   <b>-fno-align-jumps</b>  and
           <b>-falign-jumps=1</b> are equivalent and mean that loops are not aligned.

           If  <u>n</u>  is  not  specified  or is zero, use a machine-dependent default.  The maximum allowed <u>n</u> option
           value is 65536.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>.

       <b>-fno-allocation-dce</b>
           Do not remove unused C++ allocations in dead code elimination.

       <b>-fallow-store-data-races</b>
           Allow the compiler to perform optimizations that may introduce new  data  races  on  stores,  without
           proving  that  the  variable  cannot  be  concurrently  accessed  by  other threads.  Does not affect
           optimization of local data.  It is safe to use this option if it is known that global data  will  not
           be accessed by multiple threads.

           Examples of optimizations enabled by <b>-fallow-store-data-races</b> include hoisting or if-conversions that
           may  cause a value that was already in memory to be re-written with that same value.  Such re-writing
           is safe in a single threaded context but may be unsafe in a multi-threaded  context.   Note  that  on
           some processors, if-conversions may be required in order to enable vectorization.

           Enabled at level <b>-Ofast</b>.

       <b>-funit-at-a-time</b>
           This   option   is   left   for   compatibility   reasons.  <b>-funit-at-a-time</b>  has  no  effect,  while
           <b>-fno-unit-at-a-time</b> implies <b>-fno-toplevel-reorder</b> and <b>-fno-section-anchors</b>.

           Enabled by default.

       <b>-fno-toplevel-reorder</b>
           Do not reorder top-level functions, variables, and "asm" statements.  Output them in the  same  order
           that  they appear in the input file.  When this option is used, unreferenced static variables are not
           removed.  This option is intended to support existing code that relies on a particular ordering.  For
           new code, it is better to use attributes when possible.

           <b>-ftoplevel-reorder</b> is the default at <b>-O1</b>  and  higher,  and  also  at  <b>-O0</b>  if  <b>-fsection-anchors</b>  is
           explicitly requested.  Additionally <b>-fno-toplevel-reorder</b> implies <b>-fno-section-anchors</b>.

       <b>-fweb</b>
           Constructs  webs  as  commonly  used  for register allocation purposes and assign each web individual
           pseudo register.  This allows the register allocation pass to operate on pseudos directly,  but  also
           strengthens  several  other  optimization  passes,  such as CSE, loop optimizer and trivial dead code
           remover.  It can, however, make debugging impossible, since variables  no  longer  stay  in  a  "home
           register".

           Enabled by default with <b>-funroll-loops</b>.

       <b>-fwhole-program</b>
           Assume  that  the  current  compilation unit represents the whole program being compiled.  All public
           functions  and  variables  with  the  exception   of   "main"   and   those   merged   by   attribute
           "externally_visible"  become  static  functions  and  in  effect  are  optimized more aggressively by
           interprocedural optimizers.

           This option should not be used in combination with <b>-flto</b>.  Instead relying on a linker plugin  should
           provide safer and more precise information.

       <b>-flto[=</b><u>n</u><b>]</b>
           This  option  runs  the  standard  link-time  optimizer.  When invoked with source code, it generates
           GIMPLE (one of GCC's internal representations) and writes it to special ELF sections  in  the  object
           file.   When  the  object  files are linked together, all the function bodies are read from these ELF
           sections and instantiated as if they had been part of the same translation unit.

           To use the link-time optimizer, <b>-flto</b> and optimization options should be specified  at  compile  time
           and  during  the  final  link.  It is recommended that you compile all the files participating in the
           same link with the same options and also specify those options at link time.  For example:

                   gcc -c -O2 -flto foo.c
                   gcc -c -O2 -flto bar.c
                   gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.o bar.o

           The first two invocations to GCC save a bytecode representation of GIMPLE into special  ELF  sections
           inside  <u>foo.o</u> and <u>bar.o</u>.  The final invocation reads the GIMPLE bytecode from <u>foo.o</u> and <u>bar.o</u>, merges
           the two files into a single internal image, and compiles the result as usual.  Since both  <u>foo.o</u>  and
           <u>bar.o</u>  are merged into a single image, this causes all the interprocedural analyses and optimizations
           in GCC to work across the two files as if they were a single one.  This means, for example, that  the
           inliner is able to inline functions in <u>bar.o</u> into functions in <u>foo.o</u> and vice-versa.

           Another (simpler) way to enable link-time optimization is:

                   gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.c bar.c

           The  above  generates  bytecode  for  <u>foo.c</u>  and  <u>bar.c</u>,  merges  them  together into a single GIMPLE
           representation and optimizes them as usual to produce <u>myprog</u>.

           The important thing to keep in mind is that to enable link-time optimizations you need to use the GCC
           driver to perform the link step.  GCC automatically performs link-time optimization  if  any  of  the
           objects  involved  were  compiled  with  the  <b>-flto</b> command-line option.  You can always override the
           automatic decision to do link-time optimization by passing <b>-fno-lto</b> to the link command.

           To make whole program  optimization  effective,  it  is  necessary  to  make  certain  whole  program
           assumptions.   The  compiler  needs to know what functions and variables can be accessed by libraries
           and runtime outside of the link-time optimized unit.  When supported by the linker, the linker plugin
           (see <b>-fuse-linker-plugin</b>) passes information to  the  compiler  about  used  and  externally  visible
           symbols.   When  the  linker  plugin  is  not  available, <b>-fwhole-program</b> should be used to allow the
           compiler to make these assumptions, which leads to more aggressive optimization decisions.

           When a file is compiled with <b>-flto</b> without <b>-fuse-linker-plugin</b>, the generated object file  is  larger
           than  a  regular  object  file  because  it  contains  GIMPLE bytecodes and the usual final code (see
           <b>-ffat-lto-objects</b>).  This means that object files with LTO information can be linked as normal object
           files; if <b>-fno-lto</b> is passed to the linker, no interprocedural optimizations are applied.  Note  that
           when  <b>-fno-fat-lto-objects</b>  is  enabled the compile stage is faster but you cannot perform a regular,
           non-LTO link on them.

           When producing the final binary, GCC only applies link-time optimizations to those files that contain
           bytecode.  Therefore, you can mix and match object files and  libraries  with  GIMPLE  bytecodes  and
           final  object code.  GCC automatically selects which files to optimize in LTO mode and which files to
           link without further processing.

           Generally, options specified at link time override those specified at compile time, although in  some
           cases GCC attempts to infer link-time options from the settings used to compile the input files.

           If  you  do  not  specify  an  optimization  level  option <b>-O</b> at link time, then GCC uses the highest
           optimization level used when compiling the object files.  Note that it is  generally  ineffective  to
           specify  an  optimization  level  option  only at link time and not at compile time, for two reasons.
           First, compiling without optimization suppresses compiler passes that gather information  needed  for
           effective optimization at link time.  Second, some early optimization passes can be performed only at
           compile time and not at link time.

           There  are  some code generation flags preserved by GCC when generating bytecodes, as they need to be
           used during the final link.  Currently, the following options and their settings are taken  from  the
           first  object  file  that  explicitly  specifies them: <b>-fcommon</b>, <b>-fexceptions</b>, <b>-fnon-call-exceptions</b>,
           <b>-fgnu-tm</b> and all the <b>-m</b> target flags.

           The following options <b>-fPIC</b>, <b>-fpic</b>, <b>-fpie</b> and <b>-fPIE</b> are combined based on the following scheme:

                   B&lt;-fPIC&gt; + B&lt;-fpic&gt; = B&lt;-fpic&gt;
                   B&lt;-fPIC&gt; + B&lt;-fno-pic&gt; = B&lt;-fno-pic&gt;
                   B&lt;-fpic/-fPIC&gt; + (no option) = (no option)
                   B&lt;-fPIC&gt; + B&lt;-fPIE&gt; = B&lt;-fPIE&gt;
                   B&lt;-fpic&gt; + B&lt;-fPIE&gt; = B&lt;-fpie&gt;
                   B&lt;-fPIC/-fpic&gt; + B&lt;-fpie&gt; = B&lt;-fpie&gt;

           Certain ABI-changing flags are required to match in all compilation units,  and  trying  to  override
           this   at   link  time  with  a  conflicting  value  is  ignored.   This  includes  options  such  as
           <b>-freg-struct-return</b> and <b>-fpcc-struct-return</b>.

           Other   options   such   as   <b>-ffp-contract</b>,    <b>-fno-strict-overflow</b>,    <b>-fwrapv</b>,    <b>-fno-trapv</b>    or
           <b>-fno-strict-aliasing</b>  are  passed through to the link stage and merged conservatively for conflicting
           translation units.  Specifically <b>-fno-strict-overflow</b>, <b>-fwrapv</b> and <b>-fno-trapv</b>  take  precedence;  and
           for  example  <b>-ffp-contract=off</b>  takes  precedence over <b>-ffp-contract=fast</b>.  You can override them at
           link time.

           Diagnostic options such as <b>-Wstringop-overflow</b> are passed through to the link stage and their setting
           matches that of  the  compile-step  at  function  granularity.   Note  that  this  matters  only  for
           diagnostics  emitted  during  optimization.   Note  that code transforms such as inlining can lead to
           warnings being enabled or disabled for regions if code not consistent with  the  setting  at  compile
           time.

           When  you  need  to  pass options to the assembler via <b>-Wa</b> or <b>-Xassembler</b> make sure to either compile
           such translation units  with  <b>-fno-lto</b>  or  consistently  use  the  same  assembler  options  on  all
           translation units.  You can alternatively also specify assembler options at LTO link time.

           To  enable debug info generation you need to supply <b>-g</b> at compile time.  If any of the input files at
           link time were built with debug info generation enabled the link will enable debug info generation as
           well.  Any elaborate debug info settings like  the  dwarf  level  <b>-gdwarf-5</b>  need  to  be  explicitly
           repeated  at  the linker command line and mixing different settings in different translation units is
           discouraged.

           If LTO encounters objects with C linkage declared with incompatible  types  in  separate  translation
           units  to  be linked together (undefined behavior according to ISO C99 6.2.7), a non-fatal diagnostic
           may be issued.  The behavior is still undefined at run time.  Similar diagnostics may be  raised  for
           other languages.

           Another feature of LTO is that it is possible to apply interprocedural optimizations on files written
           in different languages:

                   gcc -c -flto foo.c
                   g++ -c -flto bar.cc
                   gfortran -c -flto baz.f90
                   g++ -o myprog -flto -O3 foo.o bar.o baz.o -lgfortran

           Notice  that the final link is done with <b>g++</b> to get the C++ runtime libraries and <b>-lgfortran</b> is added
           to get the Fortran runtime libraries.  In general, when mixing languages in LTO mode, you should  use
           the same link command options as when mixing languages in a regular (non-LTO) compilation.

           If  object  files  containing  GIMPLE  bytecode  are stored in a library archive, say <u>libfoo.a</u>, it is
           possible to extract and use them in an LTO link if you are using a linker with  plugin  support.   To
           create static libraries suitable for LTO, use <b>gcc-ar</b> and <b>gcc-ranlib</b> instead of <b>ar</b> and <b>ranlib</b>; to show
           the symbols of object files with GIMPLE bytecode, use <b>gcc-nm</b>.  Those commands require that <b>ar</b>, <b>ranlib</b>
           and  <b>nm</b>  have  been  compiled with plugin support.  At link time, use the flag <b>-fuse-linker-plugin</b> to
           ensure that the library participates in the LTO optimization process:

                   gcc -o myprog -O2 -flto -fuse-linker-plugin a.o b.o -lfoo

           With the linker plugin enabled, the linker extracts the needed GIMPLE files from <u>libfoo.a</u> and  passes
           them on to the running GCC to make them part of the aggregated GIMPLE image to be optimized.

           If  you  are  not using a linker with plugin support and/or do not enable the linker plugin, then the
           objects inside <u>libfoo.a</u> are extracted and linked as usual, but they do not  participate  in  the  LTO
           optimization process.  In order to make a static library suitable for both LTO optimization and usual
           linkage, compile its object files with <b>-flto</b> <b>-ffat-lto-objects</b>.

           Link-time  optimizations do not require the presence of the whole program to operate.  If the program
           does not require any symbols to be exported, it is possible to combine <b>-flto</b> and  <b>-fwhole-program</b>  to
           allow  the  interprocedural  optimizers to use more aggressive assumptions which may lead to improved
           optimization opportunities.  Use of <b>-fwhole-program</b> is not needed when linker plugin is  active  (see
           <b>-fuse-linker-plugin</b>).

           The  current  implementation  of  LTO  makes no attempt to generate bytecode that is portable between
           different types of hosts.  The bytecode files are versioned and there is a strict version  check,  so
           bytecode files generated in one version of GCC do not work with an older or newer version of GCC.

           Link-time  optimization  does not work well with generation of debugging information on systems other
           than those using a combination of ELF and DWARF.

           If you specify the optional <u>n</u>, the optimization and code generation done at link time is executed  in
           parallel using <u>n</u> parallel jobs by utilizing an installed <b>make</b> program.  The environment variable <b>MAKE</b>
           may be used to override the program used.

           You  can  also  specify  <b>-flto=jobserver</b> to use GNU make's job server mode to determine the number of
           parallel jobs. This is useful when the Makefile calling GCC is already executing  in  parallel.   You
           must  prepend  a <b>+</b> to the command recipe in the parent Makefile for this to work.  This option likely
           only works if <b>MAKE</b> is GNU make.  Even without the option value, GCC tries to automatically  detect  a
           running GNU make's job server.

           Use <b>-flto=auto</b> to use GNU make's job server, if available, or otherwise fall back to autodetection of
           the number of CPU threads present in your system.

       <b>-flto-partition=</b><u>alg</u>
           Specify  the  partitioning  algorithm  used  by the link-time optimizer.  The value is either <b>1to1</b> to
           specify a partitioning mirroring the original source files or <b>balanced</b> to specify  partitioning  into
           equally  sized  chunks  (whenever  possible)  or  <b>max</b>  to create new partition for every symbol where
           possible.  Specifying <b>none</b> as an algorithm  disables  partitioning  and  streaming  completely.   The
           default  value is <b>balanced</b>. While <b>1to1</b> can be used as an workaround for various code ordering issues,
           the <b>max</b> partitioning is intended for internal testing only.  The value <b>one</b> specifies that exactly one
           partition should be used while the value  <b>none</b>  bypasses  partitioning  and  executes  the  link-time
           optimization step directly from the WPA phase.

       <b>-flto-compression-level=</b><u>n</u>
           This  option  specifies the level of compression used for intermediate language written to LTO object
           files, and is only meaningful in conjunction with LTO mode (<b>-flto</b>).  GCC currently supports  two  LTO
           compression  algorithms.  For  zstd, valid values are 0 (no compression) to 19 (maximum compression),
           while zlib supports values from 0 to 9.  Values outside this range are clamped to either  minimum  or
           maximum  of the supported values.  If the option is not given, a default balanced compression setting
           is used.

       <b>-fuse-linker-plugin</b>
           Enables the use of a linker plugin during link-time  optimization.   This  option  relies  on  plugin
           support in the linker, which is available in gold or in GNU ld 2.21 or newer.

           This option enables the extraction of object files with GIMPLE bytecode out of library archives. This
           improves  the  quality  of  optimization  by  exposing  more  code  to the link-time optimizer.  This
           information specifies what symbols can be accessed externally (by non-LTO object  or  during  dynamic
           linking).   Resulting  code  quality  improvements  on binaries (and shared libraries that use hidden
           visibility) are similar to <b>-fwhole-program</b>.  See <b>-flto</b> for a description of the effect of  this  flag
           and how to use it.

           This  option  is enabled by default when LTO support in GCC is enabled and GCC was configured for use
           with a linker supporting plugins (GNU ld 2.21 or newer or gold).

       <b>-ffat-lto-objects</b>
           Fat LTO objects are object files that contain both the intermediate language  and  the  object  code.
           This  makes  them  usable for both LTO linking and normal linking. This option is effective only when
           compiling with <b>-flto</b> and is ignored at link time.

           <b>-fno-fat-lto-objects</b> improves compilation time over plain LTO, but requires the complete toolchain to
           be aware of  LTO.  It  requires  a  linker  with  linker  plugin  support  for  basic  functionality.
           Additionally,  <b>nm</b>,  <b>ar</b>  and  <b>ranlib</b>  need  to  support  linker plugins to allow a full-featured build
           environment (capable of building static libraries etc).  GCC provides the <b>gcc-ar</b>, <b>gcc-nm</b>,  <b>gcc-ranlib</b>
           wrappers  to pass the right options to these tools. With non fat LTO makefiles need to be modified to
           use them.

           Note that modern binutils provide plugin auto-load mechanism.   Installing  the  linker  plugin  into
           <u>$libdir/bfd-plugins</u>  has  the  same  effect as usage of the command wrappers (<b>gcc-ar</b>, <b>gcc-nm</b> and <b>gcc-</b>
           <b>ranlib</b>).

           The default is <b>-fno-fat-lto-objects</b> on targets with linker plugin support.

       <b>-fcompare-elim</b>
           After register allocation and post-register allocation  instruction  splitting,  identify  arithmetic
           instructions that compute processor flags similar to a comparison operation based on that arithmetic.
           If possible, eliminate the explicit comparison operation.

           This  pass  only applies to certain targets that cannot explicitly represent the comparison operation
           before register allocation is complete.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fcprop-registers</b>
           After register allocation  and  post-register  allocation  instruction  splitting,  perform  a  copy-
           propagation pass to try to reduce scheduling dependencies and occasionally eliminate the copy.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fprofile-correction</b>
           Profiles  collected  using an instrumented binary for multi-threaded programs may be inconsistent due
           to missed counter updates. When this option is specified, GCC uses heuristics to  correct  or  smooth
           out  such  inconsistencies.  By  default,  GCC emits an error message when an inconsistent profile is
           detected.

           This option is enabled by <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-fprofile-partial-training</b>
           With "-fprofile-use" all portions of programs not executed during train run are optimized agressively
           for size rather than speed.  In some cases it is not practical to train all possible hot paths in the
           program. (For example, program may contain functions specific for a given hardware and  trianing  may
           not  cover all hardware configurations program is run on.)  With "-fprofile-partial-training" profile
           feedback will be ignored for all functions not executed during the  train  run  leading  them  to  be
           optimized  as  if  they were compiled without profile feedback. This leads to better performance when
           train run is not representative but also leads to significantly bigger code.

       <b>-fprofile-use</b>
       <b>-fprofile-use=</b><u>path</u>
           Enable profile feedback-directed optimizations, and the following optimizations, many  of  which  are
           generally profitable only with profile feedback available:

           <b>-fbranch-probabilities</b>     <b>-fprofile-values</b>    <b>-funroll-loops</b>     <b>-fpeel-loops</b>     <b>-ftracer</b>     <b>-fvpt</b>
           <b>-finline-functions</b>   <b>-fipa-cp</b>   <b>-fipa-cp-clone</b>   <b>-fipa-bit-cp</b>  <b>-fpredictive-commoning</b>   <b>-fsplit-loops</b>
           <b>-funswitch-loops</b>        <b>-fgcse-after-reload</b>         <b>-ftree-loop-vectorize</b>        <b>-ftree-slp-vectorize</b>
           <b>-fvect-cost-model=dynamic</b>  <b>-ftree-loop-distribute-patterns</b> <b>-fprofile-reorder-functions</b>

           Before you can use this option, you must first generate profiling information.

           By default, GCC emits an error message if the feedback profiles do not match the source  code.   This
           error  can  be  turned into a warning by using <b>-Wno-error=coverage-mismatch</b>.  Note this may result in
           poorly optimized code.  Additionally, by default, GCC also emits a warning message  if  the  feedback
           profiles do not exist (see <b>-Wmissing-profile</b>).

           If  <u>path</u>  is  specified,  GCC  looks  at  the  <u>path</u>  to  find  the  profile  feedback data files. See
           <b>-fprofile-dir</b>.

       <b>-fauto-profile</b>
       <b>-fauto-profile=</b><u>path</u>
           Enable sampling-based feedback-directed optimizations, and the following optimizations, many of which
           are generally profitable only with profile feedback available:

           <b>-fbranch-probabilities</b>     <b>-fprofile-values</b>    <b>-funroll-loops</b>     <b>-fpeel-loops</b>     <b>-ftracer</b>     <b>-fvpt</b>

           <b>-fvect-cost-model=dynamic</b>  <b>-ftree-loop-distribute-patterns</b> <b>-fprofile-correction</b>

           <u>path</u>  is  the  name  of  a  file  containing AutoFDO profile information.  If omitted, it defaults to
           <u>fbdata.afdo</u> in the current directory.

           Producing an AutoFDO profile data file requires running your program  with  the  <b>perf</b>  utility  on  a
           supported GNU/Linux target system.  For more information, see &lt;<b>https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/</b>&gt;.

           E.g.

                   perf record -e br_inst_retired:near_taken -b -o perf.data \
                       -- your_program

           Then  use  the  <b>create_gcov</b> tool to convert the raw profile data to a format that can be used by GCC.
           You  must  also  supply   the   unstripped   binary   for   your   program   to   this   tool.    See
           &lt;<b>https://github.com/google/autofdo</b>&gt;.

           E.g.

                   create_gcov --binary=your_program.unstripped --profile=perf.data \
                       --gcov=profile.afdo

       The following options control compiler behavior regarding floating-point arithmetic.  These options trade
       off between speed and correctness.  All must be specifically enabled.

       <b>-ffloat-store</b>
           Do  not  store  floating-point  variables  in  registers, and inhibit other options that might change
           whether a floating-point value is taken from a register or memory.

           This option prevents undesirable excess precision on machines such as the 68000  where  the  floating
           registers  (of the 68881) keep more precision than a "double" is supposed to have.  Similarly for the
           x86 architecture.  For most programs, the excess precision does only good, but a few programs rely on
           the precise definition of IEEE floating point.  Use <b>-ffloat-store</b> for such programs, after  modifying
           them to store all pertinent intermediate computations into variables.

       <b>-fexcess-precision=</b><u>style</u>
           This  option allows further control over excess precision on machines where floating-point operations
           occur in a format with more precision or range than the IEEE standard and interchange  floating-point
           types.   By  default, <b>-fexcess-precision=fast</b> is in effect; this means that operations may be carried
           out in a wider precision than the types specified in the source if that would result in faster  code,
           and  it  is  unpredictable when rounding to the types specified in the source code takes place.  When
           compiling C, if <b>-fexcess-precision=standard</b> is specified then  excess  precision  follows  the  rules
           specified  in  ISO C99; in particular, both casts and assignments cause values to be rounded to their
           semantic types (whereas <b>-ffloat-store</b> only affects assignments).  This option is enabled  by  default
           for   C   if   a   strict   conformance  option  such  as  <b>-std=c99</b>  is  used.   <b>-ffast-math</b>  enables
           <b>-fexcess-precision=fast</b> by default regardless of whether a strict conformance option is used.

           <b>-fexcess-precision=standard</b> is not implemented for languages other than C.  On the  x86,  it  has  no
           effect  if  <b>-mfpmath=sse</b>  or  <b>-mfpmath=sse+387</b> is specified; in the former case, IEEE semantics apply
           without excess precision, and in the latter, rounding is unpredictable.

       <b>-ffast-math</b>
           Sets    the     options     <b>-fno-math-errno</b>,     <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations</b>,     <b>-ffinite-math-only</b>,
           <b>-fno-rounding-math</b>, <b>-fno-signaling-nans</b>, <b>-fcx-limited-range</b> and <b>-fexcess-precision=fast</b>.

           This option causes the preprocessor macro "__FAST_MATH__" to be defined.

           This  option is not turned on by any <b>-O</b> option besides <b>-Ofast</b> since it can result in incorrect output
           for programs that depend on an exact implementation of IEEE  or  ISO  rules/specifications  for  math
           functions.  It  may,  however,  yield  faster code for programs that do not require the guarantees of
           these specifications.

       <b>-fno-math-errno</b>
           Do not set "errno" after calling math functions that are executed with a  single  instruction,  e.g.,
           "sqrt".   A  program that relies on IEEE exceptions for math error handling may want to use this flag
           for speed while maintaining IEEE arithmetic compatibility.

           This option is not turned on by any <b>-O</b> option since it can result in incorrect  output  for  programs
           that  depend  on  an  exact implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for math functions. It
           may, however,  yield  faster  code  for  programs  that  do  not  require  the  guarantees  of  these
           specifications.

           The default is <b>-fmath-errno</b>.

           On  Darwin  systems,  the  math  library  never  sets  "errno".  There is therefore no reason for the
           compiler to consider the possibility that it might, and <b>-fno-math-errno</b> is the default.

       <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations</b>
           Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that (a) assume  that  arguments  and  results  are
           valid  and  (b) may violate IEEE or ANSI standards.  When used at link time, it may include libraries
           or startup files that change the default FPU control word or other similar optimizations.

           This option is not turned on by any <b>-O</b> option since it can result in incorrect  output  for  programs
           that  depend  on  an  exact implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for math functions. It
           may, however,  yield  faster  code  for  programs  that  do  not  require  the  guarantees  of  these
           specifications.     Enables    <b>-fno-signed-zeros</b>,    <b>-fno-trapping-math</b>,    <b>-fassociative-math</b>    and
           <b>-freciprocal-math</b>.

           The default is <b>-fno-unsafe-math-optimizations</b>.

       <b>-fassociative-math</b>
           Allow re-association of operands in series of floating-point operations.  This violates the ISO C and
           C++ language standard by possibly changing computation result.  NOTE: re-ordering may change the sign
           of zero as well as ignore NaNs and inhibit or create underflow or overflow (and thus cannot  be  used
           on code that relies on rounding behavior like "(x + 2**52) - 2**52".  May also reorder floating-point
           comparisons  and  thus  may  not be used when ordered comparisons are required.  This option requires
           that both <b>-fno-signed-zeros</b> and <b>-fno-trapping-math</b> be in effect.   Moreover,  it  doesn't  make  much
           sense   with   <b>-frounding-math</b>.   For   Fortran   the  option  is  automatically  enabled  when  both
           <b>-fno-signed-zeros</b> and <b>-fno-trapping-math</b> are in effect.

           The default is <b>-fno-associative-math</b>.

       <b>-freciprocal-math</b>
           Allow the reciprocal of a value to be  used  instead  of  dividing  by  the  value  if  this  enables
           optimizations.   For  example "x / y" can be replaced with "x * (1/y)", which is useful if "(1/y)" is
           subject to common subexpression elimination.  Note that this loses precision and increases the number
           of flops operating on the value.

           The default is <b>-fno-reciprocal-math</b>.

       <b>-ffinite-math-only</b>
           Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that assume that arguments and results are not NaNs
           or +-Infs.

           This option is not turned on by any <b>-O</b> option since it can result in incorrect  output  for  programs
           that  depend  on  an  exact implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for math functions. It
           may, however,  yield  faster  code  for  programs  that  do  not  require  the  guarantees  of  these
           specifications.

           The default is <b>-fno-finite-math-only</b>.

       <b>-fno-signed-zeros</b>
           Allow  optimizations  for  floating-point  arithmetic  that  ignore  the  signedness  of  zero.  IEEE
           arithmetic  specifies  the  behavior  of  distinct  +0.0  and  -0.0  values,  which  then   prohibits
           simplification  of  expressions  such  as x+0.0 or 0.0*x (even with <b>-ffinite-math-only</b>).  This option
           implies that the sign of a zero result isn't significant.

           The default is <b>-fsigned-zeros</b>.

       <b>-fno-trapping-math</b>
           Compile code assuming that floating-point operations cannot generate user-visible traps.  These traps
           include division by zero, overflow, underflow, inexact result and  invalid  operation.   This  option
           requires  that  <b>-fno-signaling-nans</b>  be  in effect.  Setting this option may allow faster code if one
           relies on "non-stop" IEEE arithmetic, for example.

           This option should never be turned on by any <b>-O</b> option since it can result in  incorrect  output  for
           programs  that  depend  on  an  exact  implementation  of  IEEE  or ISO rules/specifications for math
           functions.

           The default is <b>-ftrapping-math</b>.

       <b>-frounding-math</b>
           Disable transformations and optimizations that assume default floating-point rounding behavior.  This
           is round-to-zero for all floating point to integer conversions, and round-to-nearest  for  all  other
           arithmetic  truncations.   This  option  should be specified for programs that change the FP rounding
           mode dynamically, or that may be executed with a non-default rounding  mode.   This  option  disables
           constant  folding  of  floating-point  expressions at compile time (which may be affected by rounding
           mode) and arithmetic transformations that are unsafe  in  the  presence  of  sign-dependent  rounding
           modes.

           The default is <b>-fno-rounding-math</b>.

           This  option  is  experimental and does not currently guarantee to disable all GCC optimizations that
           are affected by rounding mode.  Future versions of GCC may provide  finer  control  of  this  setting
           using C99's "FENV_ACCESS" pragma.  This command-line option will be used to specify the default state
           for "FENV_ACCESS".

       <b>-fsignaling-nans</b>
           Compile  code assuming that IEEE signaling NaNs may generate user-visible traps during floating-point
           operations.  Setting this option disables optimizations that may  change  the  number  of  exceptions
           visible with signaling NaNs.  This option implies <b>-ftrapping-math</b>.

           This option causes the preprocessor macro "__SUPPORT_SNAN__" to be defined.

           The default is <b>-fno-signaling-nans</b>.

           This  option  is  experimental and does not currently guarantee to disable all GCC optimizations that
           affect signaling NaN behavior.

       <b>-fno-fp-int-builtin-inexact</b>
           Do not allow the built-in functions "ceil", "floor", "round" and "trunc", and their "float" and "long
           double" variants, to generate code that raises the "inexact" floating-point exception for  noninteger
           arguments.   ISO  C99  and C11 allow these functions to raise the "inexact" exception, but ISO/IEC TS
           18661-1:2014, the C bindings to IEEE 754-2008, as integrated into  ISO  C2X,  does  not  allow  these
           functions to do so.

           The default is <b>-ffp-int-builtin-inexact</b>, allowing the exception to be raised, unless C2X or a later C
           standard is selected.  This option does nothing unless <b>-ftrapping-math</b> is in effect.

           Even  if  <b>-fno-fp-int-builtin-inexact</b> is used, if the functions generate a call to a library function
           then the "inexact" exception may be raised if the library implementation does not follow TS 18661.

       <b>-fsingle-precision-constant</b>
           Treat floating-point constants as single precision instead of implicitly converting them  to  double-
           precision constants.

       <b>-fcx-limited-range</b>
           When  enabled,  this  option states that a range reduction step is not needed when performing complex
           division.  Also, there is no checking whether the result of a complex multiplication or  division  is
           "NaN   +   I*NaN",  with  an  attempt  to  rescue  the  situation  in  that  case.   The  default  is
           <b>-fno-cx-limited-range</b>, but is enabled by <b>-ffast-math</b>.

           This option controls the default setting of the ISO C99 "CX_LIMITED_RANGE" pragma.  Nevertheless, the
           option applies to all languages.

       <b>-fcx-fortran-rules</b>
           Complex multiplication and division follow Fortran rules.  Range reduction is done as part of complex
           division, but there is no checking whether the result of a complex multiplication or division is "NaN
           + I*NaN", with an attempt to rescue the situation in that case.

           The default is <b>-fno-cx-fortran-rules</b>.

       The following options control optimizations that may improve performance, but are not enabled by  any  <b>-O</b>
       options.  This section includes experimental options that may produce broken code.

       <b>-fbranch-probabilities</b>
           After  running  a  program  compiled  with  <b>-fprofile-arcs</b>,  you  can  compile it a second time using
           <b>-fbranch-probabilities</b>, to improve optimizations based on the number of times each branch was  taken.
           When  a  program  compiled  with <b>-fprofile-arcs</b> exits, it saves arc execution counts to a file called
           <u>sourcename.gcda</u> for each source file.  The information in this data file is  very  dependent  on  the
           structure  of  the  generated  code,  so  you must use the same source code and the same optimization
           options for both compilations.

           With <b>-fbranch-probabilities</b>, GCC puts a <b>REG_BR_PROB</b> note on each <b>JUMP_INSN</b> and <b>CALL_INSN</b>.  These  can
           be  used to improve optimization.  Currently, they are only used in one place: in <u>reorg.c</u>, instead of
           guessing which path a branch is most likely to take, the  <b>REG_BR_PROB</b>  values  are  used  to  exactly
           determine which path is taken more often.

           Enabled by <b>-fprofile-use</b> and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-fprofile-values</b>
           If  combined  with  <b>-fprofile-arcs</b>, it adds code so that some data about values of expressions in the
           program is gathered.

           With <b>-fbranch-probabilities</b>, it reads back the data gathered from profiling values of expressions for
           usage in optimizations.

           Enabled by <b>-fprofile-generate</b>, <b>-fprofile-use</b>, and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-fprofile-reorder-functions</b>
           Function reordering based on profile instrumentation collects first time of execution of  a  function
           and orders these functions in ascending order.

           Enabled with <b>-fprofile-use</b>.

       <b>-fvpt</b>
           If combined with <b>-fprofile-arcs</b>, this option instructs the compiler to add code to gather information
           about values of expressions.

           With  <b>-fbranch-probabilities</b>, it reads back the data gathered and actually performs the optimizations
           based on them.  Currently the optimizations include specialization of division operations  using  the
           knowledge about the value of the denominator.

           Enabled with <b>-fprofile-use</b> and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-frename-registers</b>
           Attempt  to  avoid  false  dependencies  in scheduled code by making use of registers left over after
           register allocation.  This optimization most benefits processors with lots of  registers.   Depending
           on  the  debug  information  format adopted by the target, however, it can make debugging impossible,
           since variables no longer stay in a "home register".

           Enabled by default with <b>-funroll-loops</b>.

       <b>-fschedule-fusion</b>
           Performs a target dependent pass over the instruction stream to schedule instructions  of  same  type
           together  because target machine can execute them more efficiently if they are adjacent to each other
           in the instruction flow.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-ftracer</b>
           Perform tail duplication to enlarge superblock size.  This transformation simplifies the control flow
           of the function allowing other optimizations to do a better job.

           Enabled by <b>-fprofile-use</b> and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-funroll-loops</b>
           Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile time or upon entry to the  loop.
           <b>-funroll-loops</b>  implies  <b>-frerun-cse-after-loop</b>,  <b>-fweb</b>  and  <b>-frename-registers</b>.   It  also turns on
           complete loop peeling (i.e. complete removal of loops with a small constant  number  of  iterations).
           This option makes code larger, and may or may not make it run faster.

           Enabled by <b>-fprofile-use</b> and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-funroll-all-loops</b>
           Unroll  all  loops,  even  if their number of iterations is uncertain when the loop is entered.  This
           usually  makes  programs  run  more  slowly.   <b>-funroll-all-loops</b>  implies  the   same   options   as
           <b>-funroll-loops</b>.

       <b>-fpeel-loops</b>
           Peels  loops  for which there is enough information that they do not roll much (from profile feedback
           or static analysis).  It also turns on complete loop peeling (i.e. complete  removal  of  loops  with
           small constant number of iterations).

           Enabled by <b>-O3</b>, <b>-fprofile-use</b>, and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-fmove-loop-invariants</b>
           Enables  the  loop invariant motion pass in the RTL loop optimizer.  Enabled at level <b>-O1</b> and higher,
           except for <b>-Og</b>.

       <b>-fsplit-loops</b>
           Split a loop into two if it contains a condition that's always true for one  side  of  the  iteration
           space and false for the other.

           Enabled by <b>-fprofile-use</b> and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-funswitch-loops</b>
           Move  branches  with  loop  invariant conditions out of the loop, with duplicates of the loop on both
           branches (modified according to result of the condition).

           Enabled by <b>-fprofile-use</b> and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-fversion-loops-for-strides</b>
           If a loop iterates over an array with a variable stride, create another  version  of  the  loop  that
           assumes the stride is always one.  For example:

                   for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i)
                     x[i * stride] = ...;

           becomes:

                   if (stride == 1)
                     for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i)
                       x[i] = ...;
                   else
                     for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i)
                       x[i * stride] = ...;

           This  is particularly useful for assumed-shape arrays in Fortran where (for example) it allows better
           vectorization assuming contiguous accesses.  This flag is enabled by default  at  <b>-O3</b>.   It  is  also
           enabled by <b>-fprofile-use</b> and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-ffunction-sections</b>
       <b>-fdata-sections</b>
           Place  each  function  or  data  item  into its own section in the output file if the target supports
           arbitrary sections.  The name of the function or the name of the data item determines  the  section's
           name in the output file.

           Use  these  options  on  systems  where  the  linker can perform optimizations to improve locality of
           reference in the instruction space.  Most systems using the ELF object format have linkers with  such
           optimizations.   On  AIX,  the  linker  rearranges  sections  (CSECTs)  based on the call graph.  The
           performance impact varies.

           Together with a linker garbage collection (linker <b>--gc-sections</b> option) these  options  may  lead  to
           smaller statically-linked executables (after stripping).

           On  ELF/DWARF  systems  these  options do not degenerate the quality of the debug information.  There
           could be issues with other object files/debug info formats.

           Only use these options when there are significant benefits from doing so.   When  you  specify  these
           options,  the  assembler  and  linker  create larger object and executable files and are also slower.
           These options affect code generation.  They prevent optimizations by the compiler and assembler using
           relative locations inside a translation unit since the locations are unknown  until  link  time.   An
           example of such an optimization is relaxing calls to short call instructions.

       <b>-fstdarg-opt</b>
           Optimize the prologue of variadic argument functions with respect to usage of those arguments.

           NOTE:  In Ubuntu 14.10 and later versions, <b>-fstack-protector-strong</b> is enabled by default for C, C++,
           ObjC, ObjC++, if none of <b>-fno-stack-protector</b>, <b>-nostdlib</b>, nor <b>-ffreestanding</b> are found.

       <b>-fsection-anchors</b>
           Try to reduce the number of symbolic address calculations by using shared "anchor" symbols to address
           nearby objects.  This transformation can help to reduce the number of GOT entries and GOT accesses on
           some targets.

           For example, the implementation of the following function "foo":

                   static int a, b, c;
                   int foo (void) { return a + b + c; }

           usually  calculates  the  addresses  of  all  three  variables,  but   if   you   compile   it   with
           <b>-fsection-anchors</b>,  it  accesses  the  variables  from  a common anchor point instead.  The effect is
           similar to the following pseudocode (which isn't valid C):

                   int foo (void)
                   {
                     register int *xr = &amp;x;
                     return xr[&amp;a - &amp;x] + xr[&amp;b - &amp;x] + xr[&amp;c - &amp;x];
                   }

           Not all targets support this option.

       <b>-fzero-call-used-regs=</b><u>choice</u>
           Zero call-used registers at function return to increase program security by either mitigating Return-
           Oriented Programming (ROP) attacks or preventing information leakage through registers.

           The possible values of <u>choice</u> are the same as for the "zero_call_used_regs" attribute.   The  default
           is <b>skip</b>.

           You   can   control   this  behavior  for  a  specific  function  by  using  the  function  attribute
           "zero_call_used_regs".

       <b>--param</b> <u>name</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>
           In some places, GCC uses various constants to control the amount of optimization that is  done.   For
           example,  GCC does not inline functions that contain more than a certain number of instructions.  You
           can control some of these constants on the command line using the <b>--param</b> option.

           The names of specific parameters, and the meaning of the values, are tied to  the  internals  of  the
           compiler, and are subject to change without notice in future releases.

           In  order  to  get  minimal,  maximal  and  default value of a parameter, one can use <b>--help=param</b> <b>-Q</b>
           options.

           In each case, the <u>value</u> is an integer.  The following choices of <u>name</u> are recognized for all targets:

           <b>predictable-branch-outcome</b>
               When branch is predicted to be taken with probability lower than  this  threshold  (in  percent),
               then it is considered well predictable.

           <b>max-rtl-if-conversion-insns</b>
               RTL  if-conversion  tries  to  remove  conditional  branches around a block and replace them with
               conditionally executed instructions.  This parameter gives the maximum number of instructions  in
               a  block  which  should  be  considered  for  if-conversion.   The  compiler  will also use other
               heuristics to decide whether if-conversion is likely to be profitable.

           <b>max-rtl-if-conversion-predictable-cost</b>
               RTL if-conversion will try to remove conditional branches around a block and  replace  them  with
               conditionally  executed instructions.  These parameters give the maximum permissible cost for the
               sequence that would be generated by if-conversion depending on whether the branch  is  statically
               determined  to be predictable or not.  The units for this parameter are the same as those for the
               GCC internal seq_cost metric.  The compiler will try to provide a  reasonable  default  for  this
               parameter using the BRANCH_COST target macro.

           <b>max-crossjump-edges</b>
               The  maximum  number  of  incoming  edges  to  consider for cross-jumping.  The algorithm used by
               <b>-fcrossjumping</b> is O(N^2) in the number of edges incoming to each block.  Increasing  values  mean
               more   aggressive  optimization,  making  the  compilation  time  increase  with  probably  small
               improvement in executable size.

           <b>min-crossjump-insns</b>
               The minimum number of instructions that must be matched at the end of two  blocks  before  cross-
               jumping  is  performed  on them.  This value is ignored in the case where all instructions in the
               block being cross-jumped from are matched.

           <b>max-grow-copy-bb-insns</b>
               The maximum code size expansion factor  when  copying  basic  blocks  instead  of  jumping.   The
               expansion is relative to a jump instruction.

           <b>max-goto-duplication-insns</b>
               The  maximum  number  of  instructions to duplicate to a block that jumps to a computed goto.  To
               avoid O(N^2) behavior in a number of passes, GCC factors computed gotos early in the  compilation
               process,  and  unfactors  them  as  late  as possible.  Only computed jumps at the end of a basic
               blocks with no more than max-goto-duplication-insns are unfactored.

           <b>max-delay-slot-insn-search</b>
               The maximum number of instructions to consider when looking for an instruction to  fill  a  delay
               slot.   If  more  than  this arbitrary number of instructions are searched, the time savings from
               filling the delay slot are minimal, so stop searching.  Increasing values  mean  more  aggressive
               optimization,  making  the compilation time increase with probably small improvement in execution
               time.

           <b>max-delay-slot-live-search</b>
               When trying to fill delay slots, the maximum number of instructions to  consider  when  searching
               for a block with valid live register information.  Increasing this arbitrarily chosen value means
               more  aggressive optimization, increasing the compilation time.  This parameter should be removed
               when the delay slot code is rewritten to maintain the control-flow graph.

           <b>max-gcse-memory</b>
               The approximate maximum amount of memory in "kB" that can be allocated in order  to  perform  the
               global common subexpression elimination optimization.  If more memory than specified is required,
               the optimization is not done.

           <b>max-gcse-insertion-ratio</b>
               If  the ratio of expression insertions to deletions is larger than this value for any expression,
               then RTL PRE inserts or removes the expression and thus leaves partially  redundant  computations
               in the instruction stream.

           <b>max-pending-list-length</b>
               The  maximum  number  of pending dependencies scheduling allows before flushing the current state
               and starting over.  Large functions with few branches or calls can create excessively large lists
               which needlessly consume memory and resources.

           <b>max-modulo-backtrack-attempts</b>
               The maximum number of backtrack attempts the scheduler should make when modulo scheduling a loop.
               Larger values can exponentially increase compilation time.

           <b>max-inline-insns-single</b>
               Several parameters control the tree inliner used in GCC.  This number sets the maximum number  of
               instructions  (counted  in  GCC's  internal  representation)  in  a single function that the tree
               inliner considers for  inlining.   This  only  affects  functions  declared  inline  and  methods
               implemented in a class declaration (C++).

           <b>max-inline-insns-auto</b>
               When you use <b>-finline-functions</b> (included in <b>-O3</b>), a lot of functions that would otherwise not be
               considered  for inlining by the compiler are investigated.  To those functions, a different (more
               restrictive) limit compared to functions declared inline  can  be  applied  (<b>--param</b>  <b>max-inline-</b>
               <b>insns-auto</b>).

           <b>max-inline-insns-small</b>
               This is bound applied to calls which are considered relevant with <b>-finline-small-functions</b>.

           <b>max-inline-insns-size</b>
               This  is  bound  applied  to calls which are optimized for size. Small growth may be desirable to
               anticipate optimization oppurtunities exposed by inlining.

           <b>uninlined-function-insns</b>
               Number of instructions accounted by inliner for function overhead such as function  prologue  and
               epilogue.

           <b>uninlined-function-time</b>
               Extra  time  accounted  by  inliner for function overhead such as time needed to execute function
               prologue and epilogue

           <b>inline-heuristics-hint-percent</b>
               The scale (in percents) applied to <b>inline-insns-single</b>, <b>inline-insns-single-O2</b>, <b>inline-insns-auto</b>
               when inline heuristics hints that inlining is very profitable (will enable later optimizations).

           <b>uninlined-thunk-insns</b>
           <b>uninlined-thunk-time</b>
               Same as <b>--param</b> <b>uninlined-function-insns</b>  and  <b>--param</b>  <b>uninlined-function-time</b>  but  applied  to
               function thunks

           <b>inline-min-speedup</b>
               When  estimated  performance  improvement  of  caller + callee runtime exceeds this threshold (in
               percent), the function can be inlined regardless of the limit on <b>--param</b>  <b>max-inline-insns-single</b>
               and <b>--param</b> <b>max-inline-insns-auto</b>.

           <b>large-function-insns</b>
               The  limit  specifying  really  large  functions.   For  functions  larger  than this limit after
               inlining, inlining is constrained by <b>--param</b> <b>large-function-growth</b>.   This  parameter  is  useful
               primarily to avoid extreme compilation time caused by non-linear algorithms used by the back end.

           <b>large-function-growth</b>
               Specifies  maximal  growth  of  large  function  caused  by  inlining  in percents.  For example,
               parameter value 100 limits large function growth to 2.0 times the original size.

           <b>large-unit-insns</b>
               The limit specifying large translation unit.  Growth caused by inlining of units larger than this
               limit is limited by <b>--param</b> <b>inline-unit-growth</b>.  For small units this might be  too  tight.   For
               example,  consider  a  unit consisting of function A that is inline and B that just calls A three
               times.  If B is small relative to A, the growth of unit is 300\% and yet such  inlining  is  very
               sane.   For  very large units consisting of small inlineable functions, however, the overall unit
               growth limit is needed to avoid exponential explosion of code size.  Thus for smaller units,  the
               size is increased to <b>--param</b> <b>large-unit-insns</b> before applying <b>--param</b> <b>inline-unit-growth</b>.

           <b>lazy-modules</b>
               Maximum number of concurrently open C++ module files when lazy loading.

           <b>inline-unit-growth</b>
               Specifies  maximal  overall  growth  of  the  compilation  unit caused by inlining.  For example,
               parameter value 20 limits unit growth to 1.2 times the  original  size.  Cold  functions  (either
               marked cold via an attribute or by profile feedback) are not accounted into the unit size.

           <b>ipa-cp-unit-growth</b>
               Specifies  maximal  overall  growth  of  the  compilation unit caused by interprocedural constant
               propagation.  For example, parameter value 10 limits unit growth to 1.1 times the original size.

           <b>ipa-cp-large-unit-insns</b>
               The size of translation unit that IPA-CP pass considers large.

           <b>large-stack-frame</b>
               The limit specifying large stack frames.  While inlining the algorithm is trying to not grow past
               this limit too much.

           <b>large-stack-frame-growth</b>
               Specifies maximal growth of large stack frames caused by  inlining  in  percents.   For  example,
               parameter value 1000 limits large stack frame growth to 11 times the original size.

           <b>max-inline-insns-recursive</b>
           <b>max-inline-insns-recursive-auto</b>
               Specifies  the  maximum  number  of  instructions  an out-of-line copy of a self-recursive inline
               function can grow into by performing recursive inlining.

               <b>--param</b> <b>max-inline-insns-recursive</b> applies to  functions  declared  inline.   For  functions  not
               declared  inline,  recursive  inlining  happens only when <b>-finline-functions</b> (included in <b>-O3</b>) is
               enabled; <b>--param</b> <b>max-inline-insns-recursive-auto</b> applies instead.

           <b>max-inline-recursive-depth</b>
           <b>max-inline-recursive-depth-auto</b>
               Specifies the maximum recursion depth used for recursive inlining.

               <b>--param</b> <b>max-inline-recursive-depth</b> applies to  functions  declared  inline.   For  functions  not
               declared  inline,  recursive  inlining  happens only when <b>-finline-functions</b> (included in <b>-O3</b>) is
               enabled; <b>--param</b> <b>max-inline-recursive-depth-auto</b> applies instead.

           <b>min-inline-recursive-probability</b>
               Recursive inlining is profitable only for function having deep recursion in average and can  hurt
               for  function  having  little  recursion  depth  by increasing the prologue size or complexity of
               function body to other optimizers.

               When profile feedback is available (see <b>-fprofile-generate</b>) the actual  recursion  depth  can  be
               guessed  from the probability that function recurses via a given call expression.  This parameter
               limits inlining only to call expressions  whose  probability  exceeds  the  given  threshold  (in
               percents).

           <b>early-inlining-insns</b>
               Specify  growth  that  the early inliner can make.  In effect it increases the amount of inlining
               for code having a large abstraction penalty.

           <b>max-early-inliner-iterations</b>
               Limit of iterations of the early inliner.  This basically bounds the number  of  nested  indirect
               calls the early inliner can resolve.  Deeper chains are still handled by late inlining.

           <b>comdat-sharing-probability</b>
               Probability  (in  percent)  that  C++  inline  function  with comdat visibility are shared across
               multiple compilation units.

           <b>modref-max-bases</b>
           <b>modref-max-refs</b>
           <b>modref-max-accesses</b>
               Specifies the maximal number of base pointers,  references  and  accesses  stored  for  a  single
               function by mod/ref analysis.

           <b>modref-max-tests</b>
               Specifies  the  maxmal  number of tests alias oracle can perform to disambiguate memory locations
               using the mod/ref information.  This parameter ought to be bigger than  <b>--param</b>  <b>modref-max-bases</b>
               and <b>--param</b> <b>modref-max-refs</b>.

           <b>modref-max-depth</b>
               Specifies  the  maximum  depth of DFS walk used by modref escape analysis.  Setting to 0 disables
               the analysis completely.

           <b>modref-max-escape-points</b>
               Specifies the maximum number of escape points tracked by modref per SSA-name.

           <b>profile-func-internal-id</b>
               A parameter to control whether to use function internal id in profile  database  lookup.  If  the
               value  is 0, the compiler uses an id that is based on function assembler name and filename, which
               makes old profile data more tolerant to source changes such as function reordering etc.

           <b>min-vect-loop-bound</b>
               The minimum number of iterations under which loops are not vectorized  when  <b>-ftree-vectorize</b>  is
               used.   The number of iterations after vectorization needs to be greater than the value specified
               by this option to allow vectorization.

           <b>gcse-cost-distance-ratio</b>
               Scaling  factor  in  calculation  of  maximum  distance  an  expression  can  be  moved  by  GCSE
               optimizations.   This  is  currently  supported  only  in the code hoisting pass.  The bigger the
               ratio, the more aggressive code hoisting is with simple expressions, i.e., the  expressions  that
               have   cost   less  than  <b>gcse-unrestricted-cost</b>.   Specifying  0  disables  hoisting  of  simple
               expressions.

           <b>gcse-unrestricted-cost</b>
               Cost, roughly measured as the cost of  a  single  typical  machine  instruction,  at  which  GCSE
               optimizations  do  not  constrain  the  distance  an  expression  can  travel.  This is currently
               supported only in the code hoisting pass.  The lesser the cost, the more aggressive code hoisting
               is.  Specifying 0 allows all expressions to travel unrestricted distances.

           <b>max-hoist-depth</b>
               The depth of search in the dominator tree for expressions  to  hoist.   This  is  used  to  avoid
               quadratic  behavior  in hoisting algorithm.  The value of 0 does not limit on the search, but may
               slow down compilation of huge functions.

           <b>max-tail-merge-comparisons</b>
               The maximum amount of similar bbs to compare a bb with.  This is used to avoid quadratic behavior
               in tree tail merging.

           <b>max-tail-merge-iterations</b>
               The maximum amount of iterations  of  the  pass  over  the  function.   This  is  used  to  limit
               compilation time in tree tail merging.

           <b>store-merging-allow-unaligned</b>
               Allow the store merging pass to introduce unaligned stores if it is legal to do so.

               wider stores in the store merging pass.

           <b>max-stores-to-track</b>
               The maximum number of stores to track at the same time in the attemt to to merge them into  wider
               stores in the store merging pass.

           <b>max-unrolled-insns</b>
               The  maximum  number of instructions that a loop may have to be unrolled.  If a loop is unrolled,
               this parameter also determines how many times the loop code is unrolled.

           <b>max-average-unrolled-insns</b>
               The maximum number of instructions biased by probabilities of their execution  that  a  loop  may
               have  to  be  unrolled.  If a loop is unrolled, this parameter also determines how many times the
               loop code is unrolled.

           <b>max-unroll-times</b>
               The maximum number of unrollings of a single loop.

           <b>max-peeled-insns</b>
               The maximum number of instructions that a loop may have to be peeled.  If a loop is peeled,  this
               parameter also determines how many times the loop code is peeled.

           <b>max-peel-times</b>
               The maximum number of peelings of a single loop.

           <b>max-peel-branches</b>

               The minimum cost of an expensive expression in the loop invariant motion.

           <b>min-loop-cond-split-prob</b>
               When  FDO  profile information is available, <b>min-loop-cond-split-prob</b> specifies minimum threshold
               for probability of semi-invariant condition statement to trigger loop split.

           <b>iv-consider-all-candidates-bound</b>
               Bound on number of candidates for induction variables, below which all candidates are  considered
               for  each  use in induction variable optimizations.  If there are more candidates than this, only
               the most relevant ones are considered to avoid quadratic time complexity.

           <b>iv-max-considered-uses</b>
               The induction variable optimizations give up on loops that contain more induction variable uses.

           <b>iv-always-prune-cand-set-bound</b>
               If the number of candidates in the  set  is  smaller  than  this  value,  always  try  to  remove

               Maximum size (in bytes) of objects tracked bytewise by dead store elimination.  Larger values may
               result in larger compilation times.

           <b>dse-max-alias-queries-per-store</b>
               Maximum  number  of  queries  into  the  alias  oracle per store.  Larger values result in larger
               compilation times and may result in more removed dead stores.

           <b>scev-max-expr-size</b>
               Bound on size of expressions used in the scalar evolutions analyzer.  Large expressions slow  the

           <b>scev-max-expr-complexity</b>
               Bound  on  the  complexity  of  the  expressions  in  the  scalar  evolutions  analyzer.  Complex
               expressions slow the analyzer.

           <b>max-tree-if-conversion-phi-args</b>
               Maximum number of arguments in a PHI supported by TREE if conversion unless the  loop  is  marked

           <b>hot-bb-count-fraction</b>
               The  denominator  n of fraction 1/n of the maximal execution count of a basic block in the entire
               program that a basic block needs to at least have in order to be considered hot.  The default  is
               10000,  which  means  that a basic block is considered hot if its execution count is greater than
               1/10000 of the maximal execution count.  0 means that it is never considered hot.  Used  in  non-
               LTO mode.

           <b>hot-bb-count-ws-permille</b>
               The  number  of most executed permilles, ranging from 0 to 1000, of the profiled execution of the
               entire program to which the execution count of a basic block must be  part  of  in  order  to  be
               considered  hot.   The  default  is  990, which means that a basic block is considered hot if its
               execution count contributes to the upper 990 permilles, or 99.0%, of the  profiled  execution  of
               the entire program.  0 means that it is never considered hot.  Used in LTO mode.

           <b>hot-bb-frequency-fraction</b>
               The  denominator  n  of  fraction 1/n of the execution frequency of the entry block of a function
               that a basic block of this function needs to at least have in order to be  considered  hot.   The
               default is 1000, which means that a basic block is considered hot in a function if it is executed
               more frequently than 1/1000 of the frequency of the entry block of the function.  0 means that it
               is never considered hot.

           <b>unlikely-bb-count-fraction</b>
               The  denominator  n  of  fraction  1/n of the number of profiled runs of the entire program below
               which the execution count of a basic block must be in order for the basic block to be  considered
               unlikely  executed.   The  default  is  20, which means that a basic block is considered unlikely
               executed if it is executed in fewer than 1/20, or 5%, of the runs of the program.  0  means  that
               it is always considered unlikely executed.

           <b>max-predicted-iterations</b>
               The  maximum  number  of  loop iterations we predict statically.  This is useful in cases where a
               function contains a single loop with known bound and another loop with unknown bound.  The  known
               number  of  iterations  is predicted correctly, while the unknown number of iterations average to
               roughly 10.  This means that the loop without bounds appears artificially cold  relative  to  the
               other one.

           <b>builtin-expect-probability</b>
               Control  the  probability  of  the  expression having the specified value. This parameter takes a

           <b>builtin-string-cmp-inline-length</b>
               The maximum length of a constant string for a builtin string cmp call eligible for inlining.

           <b>align-threshold</b>
               Select fraction of the maximal frequency of executions of a basic block in a  function  to  align
               the basic block.

           <b>align-loop-iterations</b>
               A loop expected to iterate at least the selected number of iterations is aligned.

           <b>tracer-dynamic-coverage</b>
           <b>tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback</b>
               This  value  is  used  to  limit  superblock  formation  once  the  given  percentage of executed
               instructions is covered.  This limits unnecessary code size expansion.

               The <b>tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback</b> parameter is used only when profile feedback  is  available.
               The  real  profiles (as opposed to statically estimated ones) are much less balanced allowing the
               threshold to be larger value.

           <b>tracer-max-code-growth</b>
               Stop tail duplication once code growth has reached given percentage.  This is a rather artificial
               limit, as most of the duplicates are eliminated later in cross jumping, so it may be set to  much
               higher values than is the desired code growth.

           <b>tracer-min-branch-ratio</b>
               Stop  reverse  growth  when  the reverse probability of best edge is less than this threshold (in
               percent).

           <b>tracer-min-branch-probability</b>
           <b>tracer-min-branch-probability-feedback</b>
               Stop forward growth if the best edge has probability lower than this threshold.

               Similarly to <b>tracer-dynamic-coverage</b> two parameters are provided.  <b>tracer-min-branch-probability-</b>
               <b>feedback</b>  is  used  for  compilation  with  profile  feedback  and  <b>tracer-min-branch-probability</b>
               compilation  without.   The  value  for  compilation  with  profile  feedback  needs  to  be more
               conservative (higher) in order to make tracer effective.

           <b>stack-clash-protection-guard-size</b>
               Specify the size of the operating system provided stack guard as 2 raised to <u>num</u>  bytes.   Higher
               values  may  reduce  the  number of explicit probes, but a value larger than the operating system
               provided guard will leave code vulnerable to stack clash style attacks.

           <b>stack-clash-protection-probe-interval</b>
               Stack clash protection involves probing stack space as it is allocated.  This param controls  the
               maximum  distance  between  probes  into  the  stack as 2 raised to <u>num</u> bytes.  Higher values may
               reduce the number of explicit probes, but a value larger than the operating system provided guard
               will leave code vulnerable to stack clash style attacks.

           <b>max-cse-path-length</b>
               The maximum number of basic blocks on path that CSE considers.

           <b>max-cse-insns</b>
               The maximum number of instructions CSE processes before flushing.

           <b>ggc-min-expand</b>
               GCC uses a garbage collector to manage its own memory allocation.  This parameter  specifies  the
               minimum  percentage  by  which  the  garbage collector's heap should be allowed to expand between
               collections.  Tuning this may improve compilation speed; it has no effect on code generation.

               The default is 30% + 70% * (RAM/1GB) with an upper bound of 100% when RAM &gt;= 1GB.  If "getrlimit"
               is available, the notion of "RAM" is the smallest of actual RAM and "RLIMIT_DATA" or "RLIMIT_AS".
               If GCC is not able to calculate RAM on a particular platform, the lower bound  of  30%  is  used.
               Setting  this  parameter  and <b>ggc-min-heapsize</b> to zero causes a full collection to occur at every
               opportunity.  This is extremely slow, but can be useful for debugging.

           <b>ggc-min-heapsize</b>
               Minimum size of the garbage collector's heap before it begins bothering to collect garbage.   The
               first  collection  occurs  after  the  heap  expands  by <b>ggc-min-expand</b>% beyond <b>ggc-min-heapsize</b>.
               Again, tuning this may improve compilation speed, and has no effect on code generation.

               The default is the smaller of RAM/8, RLIMIT_RSS, or a limit that tries to ensure that RLIMIT_DATA
               or RLIMIT_AS are not exceeded, but with a lower bound of 4096 (four megabytes) and an upper bound
               of 131072 (128 megabytes).  If GCC is not able to calculate RAM on  a  particular  platform,  the
               lower  bound is used.  Setting this parameter very large effectively disables garbage collection.
               Setting this parameter and <b>ggc-min-expand</b> to zero causes a full  collection  to  occur  at  every
               opportunity.

           <b>max-cselib-memory-locations</b>
               The  maximum  number of memory locations cselib should take into account.  Increasing values mean

               The  maximum number of instructions ready to be issued the scheduler should consider at any given

               The maximum number of instructions the RTL combiner tries to combine.

           <b>integer-share-limit</b>
               Small integer constants can use a shared data structure, reducing the compiler's memory usage and
               increasing its speed.  This sets the maximum value of a shared integer constant.

           <b>ssp-buffer-size</b>
               The  minimum  size  of  buffers  (i.e.  arrays)  that  receive  stack  smashing  protection  when
               <b>-fstack-protection</b> is used.

               This default before Ubuntu 10.10 was "8".  Currently  it  is  "4",  to  increase  the  number  of
               functions protected by the stack protector.

           <b>min-size-for-stack-sharing</b>
               The minimum size of variables taking part in stack slot sharing when not optimizing.

           <b>max-jump-thread-duplication-stmts</b>
               Maximum number of statements allowed in a block that needs to be duplicated when threading jumps.

           <b>prefetch-latency</b>
               Estimate on average number of instructions that  are  executed  before  prefetch  finishes.   The
               distance prefetched ahead is proportional to this constant.  Increasing this number may also lead
               to less streams being prefetched (see <b>simultaneous-prefetches</b>).

           <b>simultaneous-prefetches</b>
               Maximum number of prefetches that can run at the same time.

           <b>l1-cache-line-size</b>
               The size of cache line in L1 data cache, in bytes.

           <b>l1-cache-size</b>
               The size of L1 data cache, in kilobytes.

           <b>l2-cache-size</b>
               The size of L2 data cache, in kilobytes.

           <b>prefetch-dynamic-strides</b>
               Whether  the  loop  array prefetch pass should issue software prefetch hints for strides that are
               non-constant.  In some cases this may be beneficial, though the fact the stride  is  non-constant
               may make it hard to predict when there is clear benefit to issuing these hints.

               Set  to  1 if the prefetch hints should be issued for non-constant strides.  Set to 0 if prefetch
               hints should be issued only for strides that are known to be constant and below <b>prefetch-minimum-</b>
               <b>stride</b>.

           <b>prefetch-minimum-stride</b>
               Minimum constant stride, in bytes, to start using prefetch hints for.  If the stride is less than
               this threshold, prefetch hints will not be issued.

               This setting is useful for processors that have hardware prefetchers, in which case there may  be
               conflicts  between  the  hardware  prefetchers  and  the  software  prefetchers.  If the hardware
               prefetchers have a maximum stride they can handle, it should be used here to improve the  use  of
               software prefetchers.

               A  value of -1 means we don't have a threshold and therefore prefetch hints can be issued for any
               constant stride.

               This setting is only useful for strides that are known and constant.

           <b>loop-interchange-max-num-stmts</b>
               The maximum number of stmts in a loop to be interchanged.

           <b>loop-interchange-stride-ratio</b>
               The minimum ratio between stride of two loops for interchange to be profitable.

           <b>min-insn-to-prefetch-ratio</b>
               The minimum ratio between the number of instructions and  the  number  of  prefetches  to  enable
               prefetching in a loop.

           <b>prefetch-min-insn-to-mem-ratio</b>
               The  minimum  ratio  between  the  number  of instructions and the number of memory references to
               enable prefetching in a loop.

           <b>use-canonical-types</b>
               Whether the compiler should use the "canonical" type system.  Should always be 1,  which  uses  a
               more efficient internal mechanism for comparing types in C++ and Objective-C++.  However, if bugs
               in  the  canonical  type  system are causing compilation failures, set this value to 0 to disable
               canonical types.

           <b>switch-conversion-max-branch-ratio</b>
               Switch initialization conversion refuses to create arrays that are bigger than <b>switch-conversion-</b>
               <b>max-branch-ratio</b> times the number of branches in the switch.

           <b>max-partial-antic-length</b>
               Maximum length of the partial antic set computed during the tree partial  redundancy  elimination
               optimization  (<b>-ftree-pre</b>)  when  optimizing at <b>-O3</b> and above.  For some sorts of source code the
               enhanced partial redundancy elimination optimization can run away, consuming all  of  the  memory
               available  on  the  host machine.  This parameter sets a limit on the length of the sets that are
               computed, which prevents the runaway behavior.  Setting a value of 0 for this parameter allows an
               unlimited set length.

           <b>rpo-vn-max-loop-depth</b>
               Maximum loop depth that is value-numbered optimistically.  When the limit hits the innermost <u>rpo-</u>
               <u>vn-max-loop-depth</u> loops and the outermost loop in the loop nest are value-numbered optimistically
               and the remaining ones not.

           <b>sccvn-max-alias-queries-per-access</b>
               Maximum number of alias-oracle queries we perform when looking for  redundancies  for  loads  and
               stores.   If  this  limit  is  hit  the search is aborted and the load or store is not considered
               redundant.  The number of queries is algorithmically limited to the number of stores on all paths
               from the load to the function entry.

           <b>ira-max-loops-num</b>
               IRA uses regional register allocation by default.  If a function contains  more  loops  than  the
               number  given  by  this  parameter, only at most the given number of the most frequently-executed
               loops form regions for regional register allocation.

           <b>ira-max-conflict-table-size</b>
               Although IRA uses a sophisticated algorithm to compress the conflict table, the table  can  still
               require  excessive  amounts  of  memory for huge functions.  If the conflict table for a function
               could be more than the size in MB given by this parameter, the register allocator instead uses  a
               faster,  simpler,  and  lower-quality  algorithm that does not require building a pseudo-register
               conflict table.

           <b>ira-loop-reserved-regs</b>
               IRA can be used to evaluate more accurate register pressure in loops for decisions to  move  loop
               invariants  (see  <b>-O3</b>).   The  number  of available registers reserved for some other purposes is
               given by this parameter.  Default of the parameter is the best found from numerous experiments.

           <b>lra-inheritance-ebb-probability-cutoff</b>
               LRA tries to reuse values reloaded in registers in subsequent insns.  This optimization is called
               inheritance.  EBB is used as a region to do this optimization.  The parameter defines  a  minimal
               fall-through  edge  probability  in  percentage  used  to  add BB to inheritance EBB in LRA.  The
               default value was chosen from numerous runs of SPEC2000 on x86-64.

           <b>loop-invariant-max-bbs-in-loop</b>
               Loop invariant motion can be very expensive, both in compilation time and  in  amount  of  needed
               compile-time  memory,  with  very  large loops.  Loops with more basic blocks than this parameter
               won't have loop invariant motion optimization performed on them.

           <b>loop-max-datarefs-for-datadeps</b>
               Building data dependencies is expensive for very large loops.  This parameter limits  the  number
               of  data references in loops that are considered for data dependence analysis.  These large loops
               are no handled by the optimizations using loop data dependencies.

           <b>max-vartrack-size</b>
               Sets a maximum number of hash table slots to use during variable tracking  dataflow  analysis  of
               any  function.  If this limit is exceeded with variable tracking at assignments enabled, analysis
               for that function is retried without it, after removing all debug insns from  the  function.   If
               the  limit is exceeded even without debug insns, var tracking analysis is completely disabled for
               the function.  Setting the parameter to zero makes it unlimited.

           <b>max-vartrack-expr-depth</b>
               Sets a maximum number of recursion  levels  when  attempting  to  map  variable  names  or  debug
               temporaries  to  value  expressions.   This  trades  compilation  time  for  more  complete debug
               information.  If this is set  too  low,  value  expressions  that  are  available  and  could  be
               represented  in  debug  information may end up not being used; setting this higher may enable the
               compiler to find more complex debug expressions, but compile time and memory use may grow.

           <b>max-debug-marker-count</b>
               Sets a threshold on the number of debug markers (e.g. begin stmt  markers)  to  avoid  complexity
               explosion at inlining or expanding to RTL.  If a function has more such gimple stmts than the set
               limit,  such  stmts  will  be  dropped  from  the  inlined  copy  of a function, and from its RTL
               expansion.

           <b>min-nondebug-insn-uid</b>
               Use uids starting at this parameter for  nondebug  insns.   The  range  below  the  parameter  is
               reserved  exclusively  for debug insns created by <b>-fvar-tracking-assignments</b>, but debug insns may
               get (non-overlapping) uids above it if the reserved range is exhausted.

           <b>ipa-sra-ptr-growth-factor</b>
               IPA-SRA replaces a pointer to an aggregate with one  or  more  new  parameters  only  when  their
               cumulative  size  is  less  or  equal to <b>ipa-sra-ptr-growth-factor</b> times the size of the original
               pointer parameter.

           <b>ipa-sra-max-replacements</b>
               Maximum pieces of an aggregate that IPA-SRA tracks.  As a consequence, it  is  also  the  maximum
               number of replacements of a formal parameter.

           <b>sra-max-scalarization-size-Ospeed</b>
           <b>sra-max-scalarization-size-Osize</b>
               The  two  Scalar  Reduction of Aggregates passes (SRA and IPA-SRA) aim to replace scalar parts of
               aggregates with uses of independent scalar variables.  These parameters control the maximum size,
               in storage units, of aggregate which is considered for replacement when compiling for speed (<b>sra-</b>
               <b>max-scalarization-size-Ospeed</b>) or size (<b>sra-max-scalarization-size-Osize</b>) respectively.

           <b>sra-max-propagations</b>
               The maximum number of artificial accesses that Scalar Replacement of Aggregates (SRA) will track,
               per one local variable, in order to facilitate copy propagation.

           <b>tm-max-aggregate-size</b>
               When making copies of thread-local variables in a transaction, this parameter specifies the  size
               in  bytes  after  which variables are saved with the logging functions as opposed to save/restore
               code sequence pairs.  This option only applies when using <b>-fgnu-tm</b>.

           <b>graphite-max-nb-scop-params</b>
               To avoid exponential effects in the Graphite loop transforms,  the  number  of  parameters  in  a
               Static  Control  Part  (SCoP)  is  bounded.   A  value  of zero can be used to lift the bound.  A
               variable whose value is unknown at compilation time and defined outside a SCoP is a parameter  of
               the SCoP.

           <b>loop-block-tile-size</b>
               Loop  blocking  or strip mining transforms, enabled with <b>-floop-block</b> or <b>-floop-strip-mine</b>, strip
               mine each loop in the loop nest by a given number of iterations.  The strip length can be changed
               using the <b>loop-block-tile-size</b> parameter.

           <b>ipa-jump-function-lookups</b>
               Specifies number of statements visited during jump function offset discovery.

           <b>ipa-cp-value-list-size</b>
               IPA-CP attempts to track all possible values and types passed to a function's parameter in  order
               to  propagate them and perform devirtualization.  <b>ipa-cp-value-list-size</b> is the maximum number of
               values and types it stores per one formal parameter of a function.

           <b>ipa-cp-eval-threshold</b>
               IPA-CP calculates its own score of cloning profitability heuristics and  performs  those  cloning
               opportunities with scores that exceed <b>ipa-cp-eval-threshold</b>.

           <b>ipa-cp-max-recursive-depth</b>
               Maximum depth of recursive cloning for self-recursive function.

           <b>ipa-cp-min-recursive-probability</b>
               Recursive cloning only when the probability of call being executed exceeds the parameter.

           <b>ipa-cp-recursion-penalty</b>
               Percentage penalty the recursive functions will receive when they are evaluated for cloning.

           <b>ipa-cp-single-call-penalty</b>
               Percentage  penalty functions containing a single call to another function will receive when they
               are evaluated for cloning.

           <b>ipa-max-agg-items</b>
               IPA-CP is also capable to propagate a number of scalar values passed in  an  aggregate.  <b>ipa-max-</b>
               <b>agg-items</b> controls the maximum number of such values per one parameter.

           <b>ipa-cp-loop-hint-bonus</b>
               When  IPA-CP  determines  that  a cloning candidate would make the number of iterations of a loop
               known, it adds a bonus of <b>ipa-cp-loop-hint-bonus</b> to the profitability score of the candidate.

           <b>ipa-max-loop-predicates</b>
               The maximum number of different predicates IPA will use to describe when loops in a function have
               known properties.

           <b>ipa-max-aa-steps</b>
               During its analysis of function bodies, IPA-CP employs alias analysis in order  to  track  values
               pointed to by function parameters.  In order not spend too much time analyzing huge functions, it
               gives  up and consider all memory clobbered after examining <b>ipa-max-aa-steps</b> statements modifying
               memory.

           <b>ipa-max-switch-predicate-bounds</b>
               Maximal number of boundary endpoints of case ranges of switch statement.   For  switch  exceeding
               this  limit,  IPA-CP will not construct cloning cost predicate, which is used to estimate cloning

               Specify  mode  of OpenACC `kernels' constructs handling.  With <b>--param=openacc-kernels=decompose</b>,
               OpenACC `kernels' constructs are decomposed into parts, a sequence of  compute  constructs,  each
               then  handled  individually.   This  is work in progress.  With <b>--param=openacc-kernels=parloops</b>,
               OpenACC `kernels' constructs are handled by the <b>parloops</b> pass, en  bloc.   This  is  the  current

           The following choices of <u>name</u> are available on AArch64 targets:

           <b>aarch64-sve-compare-costs</b>
               When vectorizing for SVE, consider using "unpacked" vectors for smaller elements and use the cost
               model  to pick the cheapest approach.  Also use the cost model to choose between SVE and Advanced
               SIMD vectorization.

               Using unpacked vectors includes storing smaller  elements  in  larger  containers  and  accessing
               elements with extending loads and truncating stores.

           <b>aarch64-float-recp-precision</b>
               The  number of Newton iterations for calculating the reciprocal for float type.  The precision of
               division is proportional to this param when division approximation is enabled.  The default value
               is 1.

           <b>aarch64-double-recp-precision</b>
               The number of Newton iterations for calculating the reciprocal for double type.  The precision of
               division is propotional to this param when division approximation is enabled.  The default  value
               is 2.

           <b>aarch64-autovec-preference</b>
               Force an ISA selection strategy for auto-vectorization.  Accepts values from 0 to 4, inclusive.

               <b>0</b>   Use the default heuristics.

               <b>1</b>   Use only Advanced SIMD for auto-vectorization.

               <b>2</b>   Use only SVE for auto-vectorization.

               <b>3</b>   Use both Advanced SIMD and SVE.  Prefer Advanced SIMD when the costs are deemed equal.

               <b>4</b>   Use both Advanced SIMD and SVE.  Prefer SVE when the costs are deemed equal.

               The default value is 0.

           <b>aarch64-loop-vect-issue-rate-niters</b>
               The  tuning  for some AArch64 CPUs tries to take both latencies and issue rates into account when
               deciding whether a loop should be vectorized using SVE, vectorized using Advanced  SIMD,  or  not
               vectorized at all.  If this parameter is set to <u>n</u>, GCC will not use this heuristic for loops that
               are known to execute in fewer than <u>n</u> Advanced SIMD iterations.

   <b>Program</b> <b>Instrumentation</b> <b>Options</b>
       GCC supports a number of command-line options that control adding run-time instrumentation to the code it
       normally  generates.  For example, one purpose of instrumentation is collect profiling statistics for use
       in finding program hot spots, code coverage analysis, or profile-guided optimizations.  Another class  of
       program  instrumentation  is  adding  run-time checking to detect programming errors like invalid pointer
       dereferences or out-of-bounds array accesses, as well as  deliberately  hostile  attacks  such  as  stack
       smashing  or  C++  vtable  hijacking.   There is also a general hook which can be used to implement other
       forms of tracing or function-level instrumentation for debug or program analysis purposes.

       <b>-p</b>
       <b>-pg</b> Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the analysis program <b>prof</b> (for  <b>-p</b>)  or
           <b>gprof</b>  (for  <b>-pg</b>).  You must use this option when compiling the source files you want data about, and
           you must also use it when linking.

           You can use the function attribute  "no_instrument_function"  to  suppress  profiling  of  individual
           functions when compiling with these options.

       <b>-fprofile-arcs</b>
           Add  code  so that program flow <u>arcs</u> are instrumented.  During execution the program records how many
           times each branch and call is executed and how many times it is taken or returns.   On  targets  that
           support  constructors with priority support, profiling properly handles constructors, destructors and
           C++ constructors (and destructors) of classes which are used as a type of a global variable.

           When the compiled program exits it saves this data to a file  called  <u>auxname.gcda</u>  for  each  source
           file.   The data may be used for profile-directed optimizations (<b>-fbranch-probabilities</b>), or for test
           coverage analysis (<b>-ftest-coverage</b>).  Each object file's <u>auxname</u> is generated from the  name  of  the
           output file, if explicitly specified and it is not the final executable, otherwise it is the basename
           of  the source file.  In both cases any suffix is removed (e.g. <u>foo.gcda</u> for input file <u>dir/foo.c</u>, or
           <u>dir/foo.gcda</u> for output file specified as <b>-o</b> <b>dir/foo.o</b>).

       <b>--coverage</b>
           This option is used to compile and link code instrumented for coverage analysis.   The  option  is  a
           synonym  for  <b>-fprofile-arcs</b>  <b>-ftest-coverage</b>  (when  compiling)  and <b>-lgcov</b> (when linking).  See the
           documentation for those options for more details.

           *   Compile the source files with <b>-fprofile-arcs</b> plus optimization and code generation options.   For
               test  coverage  analysis,  use the additional <b>-ftest-coverage</b> option.  You do not need to profile
               every source file in a program.

           *   Compile the source files additionally with <b>-fprofile-abs-path</b> to create absolute  path  names  in
               the  <u>.gcno</u>  files.   This  allows <b>gcov</b> to find the correct sources in projects where compilations
               occur with different working directories.

           *   Link your object files with <b>-lgcov</b> or <b>-fprofile-arcs</b> (the latter implies the former).

           *   Run the program on a representative workload to generate the arc profile information.   This  may
               be  repeated any number of times.  You can run concurrent instances of your program, and provided
               that the file system supports locking, the data files will be correctly updated.  Unless a strict
               ISO C dialect option is in effect, "fork" calls are detected and correctly handled without double
               counting.

           *   For profile-directed optimizations, compile the source files again with the same optimization and
               code generation options plus <b>-fbranch-probabilities</b>.

           *   For test coverage analysis, use <b>gcov</b> to produce human readable information  from  the  <u>.gcno</u>  and
               <u>.gcda</u> files.  Refer to the <b>gcov</b> documentation for further information.

           With <b>-fprofile-arcs</b>, for each function of your program GCC creates a program flow graph, then finds a
           spanning  tree  for  the graph.  Only arcs that are not on the spanning tree have to be instrumented:
           the compiler adds code to count the number of times that these arcs are executed.  When an arc is the
           only exit or only entrance to a block, the instrumentation code can be added to the block; otherwise,
           a new basic block must be created to hold the instrumentation code.

       <b>-ftest-coverage</b>
           Produce a notes file that the <b>gcov</b> code-coverage utility can use  to  show  program  coverage.   Each
           source  file's  note  file  is  called  <u>auxname.gcno</u>.  Refer to the <b>-fprofile-arcs</b> option above for a
           description of <u>auxname</u> and instructions on how to generate test coverage data.  Coverage data matches
           the source files more closely if you do not optimize.

       <b>-fprofile-abs-path</b>
           Automatically convert relative source file names to absolute path names in  the  <u>.gcno</u>  files.   This
           allows  <b>gcov</b>  to find the correct sources in projects where compilations occur with different working
           directories.

       <b>-fprofile-dir=</b><u>path</u>
           Set the directory to search for the profile data files in to <u>path</u>.   This  option  affects  only  the
           profile   data   generated   by  <b>-fprofile-generate</b>,  <b>-ftest-coverage</b>,  <b>-fprofile-arcs</b>  and  used  by
           <b>-fprofile-use</b> and <b>-fbranch-probabilities</b> and its related options.  Both absolute and  relative  paths
           can  be used.  By default, GCC uses the current directory as <u>path</u>, thus the profile data file appears
           in the same directory as the object file.  In order to prevent the file name clashing, if the  object
           file name is not an absolute path, we mangle the absolute path of the <u>sourcename.gcda</u> file and use it
           as the file name of a <u>.gcda</u> file.  See similar option <b>-fprofile-note</b>.

           When  an  executable  is  run in a massive parallel environment, it is recommended to save profile to
           different folders.  That can be done with variables in <u>path</u> that are exported during run-time:

           <b>%p</b>  process ID.

           <b>%q{VAR}</b>
               value of environment variable <u>VAR</u>

       <b>-fprofile-generate</b>
       <b>-fprofile-generate=</b><u>path</u>
           Enable options usually used for  instrumenting  application  to  produce  profile  useful  for  later
           recompilation  with  profile  feedback based optimization.  You must use <b>-fprofile-generate</b> both when
           compiling and when linking your program.

           The  following  options  are  enabled:  <b>-fprofile-arcs</b>,  <b>-fprofile-values</b>,  <b>-finline-functions</b>,   and
           <b>-fipa-bit-cp</b>.

           If  <u>path</u>  is  specified,  GCC  looks  at  the  <u>path</u>  to  find  the  profile  feedback data files. See
           <b>-fprofile-dir</b>.

           To optimize the program based on the collected profile information, use <b>-fprofile-use</b>.

       <b>-fprofile-info-section</b>
       <b>-fprofile-info-section=</b><u>name</u>
           Register the profile information in the specified section instead of using a  constructor/destructor.
           The  section name is <u>name</u> if it is specified, otherwise the section name defaults to ".gcov_info".  A
           pointer to the profile information generated by <b>-fprofile-arcs</b> or <b>-ftest-coverage</b> is  placed  in  the
           specified  section  for  each  translation  unit.   This  option  disables  the  profile  information
           registration through a constructor and it disables  the  profile  information  processing  through  a
           destructor.   This  option  is  not intended to be used in hosted environments such as GNU/Linux.  It
           targets systems with limited resources which do not support constructors and destructors.  The linker
           could collect the input sections in a continuous memory block and define start and end symbols.   The
           runtime  support  could  dump  the profiling information registered in this linker set during program
           termination to a serial line for example.  A GNU linker script example which defines a linker  output
           section follows:

                     .gcov_info      :
                     {
                       PROVIDE (__gcov_info_start = .);
                       KEEP (*(.gcov_info))
                       PROVIDE (__gcov_info_end = .);
                     }

       <b>-fprofile-note=</b><u>path</u>
           If  <u>path</u>  is  specified,  GCC  saves  <u>.gcno</u>  file into <u>path</u> location.  If you combine the option with
           multiple source files, the <u>.gcno</u> file will be overwritten.

       <b>-fprofile-prefix-path=</b><u>path</u>
           This option can be used in combination with <b>profile-generate=</b><u>profile_dir</u> and  <b>profile-use=</b><u>profile_dir</u>
           to  inform GCC where is the base directory of built source tree.  By default <u>profile_dir</u> will contain
           files with mangled absolute paths of all object files in the built project.  This  is  not  desirable
           when  directory  used  to  build the instrumented binary differs from the directory used to build the
           binary optimized with profile feedback because  the  profile  data  will  not  be  found  during  the
           optimized  build.  In such setups <b>-fprofile-prefix-path=</b><u>path</u> with <u>path</u> pointing to the base directory
           of the build can be used to strip the irrelevant part of the path and keep all file names relative to
           the main build directory.

       <b>-fprofile-update=</b><u>method</u>
           Alter the update method for an application instrumented for profile feedback based optimization.  The
           <u>method</u> argument should be one of <b>single</b>, <b>atomic</b> or  <b>prefer-atomic</b>.   The  first  one  is  useful  for
           single-threaded  applications,  while  the second one prevents profile corruption by emitting thread-
           safe code.

           <b>Warning:</b> When an application does not properly join all threads (or creates an  detached  thread),  a
           profile file can be still corrupted.

           Using  <b>prefer-atomic</b>  would be transformed either to <b>atomic</b>, when supported by a target, or to <b>single</b>
           otherwise.  The GCC driver automatically selects  <b>prefer-atomic</b>  when  <b>-pthread</b>  is  present  in  the
           command line.

       <b>-fprofile-filter-files=</b><u>regex</u>
           Instrument  only functions from files whose name matches any of the regular expressions (separated by
           semi-colons).

           For example, <b>-fprofile-filter-files=main\.c;module.*\.c</b> will instrument only <u>main.c</u> and all  C  files
           starting with 'module'.

       <b>-fprofile-exclude-files=</b><u>regex</u>
           Instrument  only  functions  from  files  whose  name  does  not match any of the regular expressions
           (separated by semi-colons).

           For example, <b>-fprofile-exclude-files=<a href="file:/usr/.">/usr/.</a>*</b> will prevent  instrumentation  of  all  files  that  are
           located in the <u><a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a></u> folder.

       <b>-fprofile-reproducible=</b>[<b>multithreaded</b>|<b>parallel-runs</b>|<b>serial</b>]
           Control level of reproducibility of profile gathered by "-fprofile-generate".  This makes it possible
           to rebuild program with same outcome which is useful, for example, for distribution packages.

           With  <b>-fprofile-reproducible=serial</b>  the  profile  gathered  by  <b>-fprofile-generate</b>  is  reproducible
           provided the trained program behaves the same at each invocation of the train run, it is  not  multi-
           threaded  and  profile  data streaming is always done in the same order.  Note that profile streaming
           happens at the end of program run but also before "fork" function is invoked.

           Note that it is quite common that execution counts of some part of programs depends, for example,  on
           length  of  temporary  file names or memory space randomization (that may affect hash-table collision
           rate).  Such non-reproducible part of programs may be annotated by "no_instrument_function"  function
           attribute.  <b>gcov-dump</b>  with  <b>-l</b>  can  be  used  to dump gathered data and verify that they are indeed
           reproducible.

           With <b>-fprofile-reproducible=parallel-runs</b> collected profile stays reproducible regardless  the  order
           of  streaming  of the data into gcda files.  This setting makes it possible to run multiple instances
           of instrumented program in parallel (such as with "make -j"). This reduces quality of gathered  data,
           in particular of indirect call profiling.

       <b>-fsanitize=address</b>
           Enable  AddressSanitizer,  a fast memory error detector.  Memory access instructions are instrumented
           to     detect     out-of-bounds     and     use-after-free     bugs.      The     option      enables

       <b>-fsanitize=kernel-address</b>
           Enable AddressSanitizer for Linux kernel.  See &lt;<b>https://github.com/google/kasan</b>&gt; for more details.

       <b>-fsanitize=hwaddress</b>
           Enable Hardware-assisted AddressSanitizer, which uses a hardware ability to ignore the top byte of  a
           pointer  to  allow  the  detection  of  memory  errors  with  a  low  memory overhead.  Memory access
           instructions are instrumented to detect out-of-bounds and use-after-free bugs.   The  option  enables
           <b>-fsanitize-address-use-after-scope</b>.                                                               See
           &lt;<b>https://clang.llvm.org/docs/HardwareAssistedAddressSanitizerDesign.html</b>&gt; for more details.  The run-
           time behavior can be influenced using the <b>HWASAN_OPTIONS</b> environment variable.  When set to "help=1",
           the available options are shown at startup  of  the  instrumented  program.   The  option  cannot  be
           combined with <b>-fsanitize=thread</b> or <b>-fsanitize=address</b>, and is currently only available on AArch64.

       <b>-fsanitize=kernel-hwaddress</b>
           Enable   Hardware-assisted  AddressSanitizer  for  compilation  of  the  Linux  kernel.   Similar  to
           <b>-fsanitize=kernel-address</b>  but  using  an  alternate   instrumentation   method,   and   similar   to
           <b>-fsanitize=hwaddress</b>  but  with instrumentation differences necessary for compiling the Linux kernel.
           These differences are to avoid hwasan library initialization calls  and  to  account  for  the  stack
           pointer having a different value in its top byte.

           <u>Note:</u>  This  option  has different defaults to the <b>-fsanitize=hwaddress</b>.  Instrumenting the stack and
           alloca calls are not on by default but are still possible  by  specifying  the  command-line  options
           <b>--param</b>  <b>hwasan-instrument-stack=1</b>  and  <b>--param</b>  <b>hwasan-instrument-allocas=1</b>  respectively.  Using a
           random frame tag is not implemented for kernel instrumentation.

       <b>-fsanitize=pointer-compare</b>

           "detect_invalid_pointer_pairs=1" detects invalid operation only when both pointers are non-null.

       <b>-fsanitize=pointer-subtract</b>
           Instrument  subtraction  with  pointer  operands.   The  option  must   be   combined   with   either
           <b>-fsanitize=kernel-address</b> or <b>-fsanitize=address</b> The option cannot be combined with <b>-fsanitize=thread</b>.
           Note:    By    default    the    check    is   disabled   at   run   time.    To   enable   it,   add

           The option cannot be combined with <b>-fsanitize=address</b>, <b>-fsanitize=leak</b>.

           Note  that  sanitized  atomic  builtins  cannot  throw  exceptions  when  operating on invalid memory
           addresses with non-call exceptions (<b>-fnon-call-exceptions</b>).

       <b>-fsanitize=leak</b>
           Enable LeakSanitizer, a memory leak detector.  This option only matters for  linking  of  executables
           and the executable is linked against a library that overrides "malloc" and other allocator functions.

           instrumented       to       detect       undefined       behavior       at       runtime.         See
           &lt;<b>https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html</b>&gt;   for   more  details.    The  run-time
           behavior can be influenced using the <b>UBSAN_OPTIONS</b> environment variable.  Current suboptions are:

           <b>-fsanitize=shift</b>
               This option enables checking that the result of a shift operation is not  undefined.   Note  that
               what  exactly  is considered undefined differs slightly between C and C++, as well as between ISO
               C90   and   C99,   etc.    This   option   has   two   suboptions,   <b>-fsanitize=shift-base</b>    and
               <b>-fsanitize=shift-exponent</b>.

           <b>-fsanitize=shift-exponent</b>
               This option enables checking that the second argument of a shift operation is not negative and is
               smaller than the precision of the promoted first argument.

           <b>-fsanitize=shift-base</b>
               If  the  second  argument  of a shift operation is within range, check that the result of a shift
               operation is not undefined.  Note that what exactly  is  considered  undefined  differs  slightly
               between C and C++, as well as between ISO C90 and C99, etc.

           <b>-fsanitize=integer-divide-by-zero</b>
               Detect integer division by zero as well as "INT_MIN / -1" division.

           <b>-fsanitize=unreachable</b>
               With  this option, the compiler turns the "__builtin_unreachable" call into a diagnostics message
               call instead.  When reaching the "__builtin_unreachable" call, the behavior is undefined.

           <b>-fsanitize=vla-bound</b>
               This option instructs the compiler to check that the size of a variable length array is positive.

           <b>-fsanitize=null</b>
               This option enables pointer checking.  Particularly,  the  application  built  with  this  option
               turned  on  will  issue  an  error  message  when it tries to dereference a NULL pointer, or if a
               reference (possibly an rvalue reference) is bound to a NULL pointer, or if a method is invoked on
               an object pointed by a NULL pointer.

           <b>-fsanitize=return</b>
               This option enables return statement checking.  Programs built with this option  turned  on  will
               issue  an error message when the end of a non-void function is reached without actually returning
               a value.  This option works in C++ only.

           <b>-fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow</b>
               This option enables signed integer overflow checking.  We check that the result of "+", "*",  and
               both  unary  and binary "-" does not overflow in the signed arithmetics.  Note, integer promotion
               rules must be taken into account.  That is, the following is not an overflow:

                       signed char a = SCHAR_MAX;
                       a++;

           <b>-fsanitize=bounds</b>
               This option enables instrumentation  of  array  bounds.   Various  out  of  bounds  accesses  are
               detected.   Flexible  array  members,  flexible  array  member-like  arrays,  and initializers of
               variables with static storage are not instrumented.

           <b>-fsanitize=bounds-strict</b>
               This option enables strict instrumentation of array bounds.  Most  out  of  bounds  accesses  are
               detected,  including  flexible array members and flexible array member-like arrays.  Initializers
               of variables with static storage are not instrumented.

           <b>-fsanitize=alignment</b>
               This option enables checking of alignment of pointers when  they  are  dereferenced,  or  when  a
               reference  is  bound to insufficiently aligned target, or when a method or constructor is invoked
               on insufficiently aligned object.

           <b>-fsanitize=object-size</b>
               This option enables  instrumentation  of  memory  references  using  the  "__builtin_object_size"
               function.  Various out of bounds pointer accesses are detected.

           <b>-fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero</b>
               Detect     floating-point     division     by    zero.     Unlike    other    similar    options,
               <b>-fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero</b> is not  enabled  by  <b>-fsanitize=undefined</b>,  since  floating-point
               division by zero can be a legitimate way of obtaining infinities and NaNs.

           <b>-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow</b>
               This option enables floating-point type to integer conversion checking.  We check that the result
               of     the     conversion     does    not    overflow.     Unlike    other    similar    options,
               <b>-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow</b> is not enabled by <b>-fsanitize=undefined</b>.  This option does not work
               well with "FE_INVALID" exceptions enabled.

           <b>-fsanitize=nonnull-attribute</b>
               This option enables instrumentation of calls, checking whether null  values  are  not  passed  to
               arguments marked as requiring a non-null value by the "nonnull" function attribute.

           <b>-fsanitize=returns-nonnull-attribute</b>
               This   option   enables   instrumentation   of   return   statements  in  functions  marked  with
               "returns_nonnull" function attribute, to detect returning of null values from such functions.

           <b>-fsanitize=bool</b>
               This option enables instrumentation of loads from bool.  If a value other than 0/1 is  loaded,  a
               run-time error is issued.

           <b>-fsanitize=enum</b>
               This  option enables instrumentation of loads from an enum type.  If a value outside the range of
               values for the enum type is loaded, a run-time error is issued.

           <b>-fsanitize=vptr</b>
               This option enables instrumentation of C++  member  function  calls,  member  accesses  and  some
               conversions between pointers to base and derived classes, to verify the referenced object has the
               correct dynamic type.

           <b>-fsanitize=pointer-overflow</b>
               This  option  enables  instrumentation  of  pointer  arithmetics.   If  the  pointer  arithmetics
               overflows, a run-time error is issued.

           <b>-fsanitize=builtin</b>
               This option enables instrumentation of arguments to selected builtin functions.   If  an  invalid
               value is passed to such arguments, a run-time error is issued.  E.g. passing 0 as the argument to
               "__builtin_ctz" or "__builtin_clz" invokes undefined behavior and is diagnosed by this option.

           While  <b>-ftrapv</b>  causes  traps  for  signed  overflows  to  be  emitted,  <b>-fsanitize=undefined</b> gives a
           diagnostic message.  This currently works only for the C family of languages.

       <b>-fno-sanitize=all</b>
           This option disables all previously enabled sanitizers.   <b>-fsanitize=all</b>  is  not  allowed,  as  some
           sanitizers cannot be used together.

       <b>-fasan-shadow-offset=</b><u>number</u>
           This  option  forces  GCC  to  use custom shadow offset in AddressSanitizer checks.  It is useful for
           experimenting with different shadow memory layouts in Kernel AddressSanitizer.

       <b>-fsanitize-sections=</b><u>s1</u><b>,</b><u>s2</u><b>,...</b>
           Sanitize global variables in selected user-defined sections.  <u>si</u> may contain wildcards.

       <b>-fsanitize-recover</b>[<b>=</b><u>opts</u>]
           <b>-fsanitize-recover=</b> controls error recovery mode for sanitizers mentioned in comma-separated list  of
           <u>opts</u>.   Enabling  this  option for a sanitizer component causes it to attempt to continue running the
           program as if no error happened.  This means multiple runtime errors can  be  reported  in  a  single
           program  run,  and  the  exit  code  of  the  program may indicate success even when errors have been
           reported.  The <b>-fno-sanitize-recover=</b> option can be used to  alter  this  behavior:  only  the  first
           detected error is reported and program then exits with a non-zero exit code.

           Currently   this  feature  only  works  for  <b>-fsanitize=undefined</b>  (and  its  suboptions  except  for
           <b>-fsanitize=unreachable</b>        and         <b>-fsanitize=return</b>),         <b>-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow</b>,
           <b>-fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero</b>,      <b>-fsanitize=bounds-strict</b>,     <b>-fsanitize=kernel-address</b>     and
           <b>-fsanitize=address</b>.   For  these  sanitizers  error  recovery  is  turned  on  by   default,   except
           <b>-fsanitize=address</b>,   for   which   this   feature   is   experimental.   <b>-fsanitize-recover=all</b>  and
           <b>-fno-sanitize-recover=all</b> is also accepted, the former  enables  recovery  for  all  sanitizers  that
           support it, the latter disables recovery for all sanitizers that support it.

           Even  if  a  recovery mode is turned on the compiler side, it needs to be also enabled on the runtime
           library  side,  otherwise  the  failures  are  still  fatal.   The  runtime   library   defaults   to
           "halt_on_error=0"  for  ThreadSanitizer  and  UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer,  while  default  value  for
           AddressSanitizer is "halt_on_error=1". This can be overridden  through  setting  the  "halt_on_error"
           flag in the corresponding environment variable.

           Syntax without an explicit <u>opts</u> parameter is deprecated.  It is equivalent to specifying an <u>opts</u> list
           of:

                   undefined,float-cast-overflow,float-divide-by-zero,bounds-strict

       <b>-fsanitize-address-use-after-scope</b>
           Enable sanitization of local variables to detect use-after-scope bugs.  The option sets <b>-fstack-reuse</b>
           to <b>none</b>.

       <b>-fsanitize-undefined-trap-on-error</b>
           The  <b>-fsanitize-undefined-trap-on-error</b>  option  instructs  the compiler to report undefined behavior
           using "__builtin_trap" rather than a "libubsan" library routine.  The advantage of this is  that  the
           "libubsan"  library  is  not  needed  and  is  not  linked in, so this is usable even in freestanding
           environments.

       <b>-fsanitize-coverage=trace-pc</b>
           Enable coverage-guided fuzzing code instrumentation.  Inserts a  call  to  "__sanitizer_cov_trace_pc"
           into every basic block.

       <b>-fsanitize-coverage=trace-cmp</b>
           Enable dataflow guided fuzzing code instrumentation.  Inserts a call to "__sanitizer_cov_trace_cmp1",
           "__sanitizer_cov_trace_cmp2",   "__sanitizer_cov_trace_cmp4"   or   "__sanitizer_cov_trace_cmp8"  for
           integral   comparison   with   both   operands   variable   or    "__sanitizer_cov_trace_const_cmp1",
           "__sanitizer_cov_trace_const_cmp2",               "__sanitizer_cov_trace_const_cmp4"               or
           "__sanitizer_cov_trace_const_cmp8"   for   integral   comparison   with   one    operand    constant,
           "__sanitizer_cov_trace_cmpf"  or  "__sanitizer_cov_trace_cmpd"  for  float  or double comparisons and
           "__sanitizer_cov_trace_switch" for switch statements.

       <b>-fcf-protection=</b>[<b>full</b>|<b>branch</b>|<b>return</b>|<b>none</b>|<b>check</b>]
           Enable code instrumentation of control-flow transfers to increase program security by  checking  that
           target  addresses  of  control-flow  transfer  instructions (such as indirect function call, function
           return, indirect jump) are valid.  This prevents diverting the  flow  of  control  to  an  unexpected
           target.   This  is intended to protect against such threats as Return-oriented Programming (ROP), and
           similarly call/jmp-oriented programming (COP/JOP).

           The value "branch" tells the compiler to implement checking of validity of control-flow  transfer  at
           the point of indirect branch instructions, i.e. call/jmp instructions.  The value "return" implements
           checking  of  validity  at  the point of returning from a function.  The value "full" is an alias for
           specifying both "branch" and "return". The value "none" turns off instrumentation.

           The value "check" is used for the final link with link-time optimization (LTO).  An error  is  issued
           if LTO object files are compiled with different <b>-fcf-protection</b> values.  The value "check" is ignored
           at the compile time.

           The  macro "__CET__" is defined when <b>-fcf-protection</b> is used.  The first bit of "__CET__" is set to 1
           for the value "branch" and the second bit of "__CET__" is set to 1 for the "return".

           You can also use the "nocf_check" attribute to identify which functions and calls should  be  skipped
           from instrumentation.

           Currently the x86 GNU/Linux target provides an implementation based on Intel Control-flow Enforcement
           Technology (CET) which works for i686 processor or newer.

           NOTE:  In  Ubuntu  19.10  and later versions, <b>-fcf-protection</b> is enabled by default for C, C++, ObjC,
           ObjC++, if none of <b>-fno-cf-protection</b> nor <b>-fcf-protection=*</b> are found.

       <b>-fstack-protector</b>
           Emit extra code to check for buffer overflows, such as stack  smashing  attacks.   This  is  done  by
           adding  a  guard  variable  to  functions with vulnerable objects.  This includes functions that call
           "alloca", and functions with buffers larger than or equal to 8 bytes.   The  guards  are  initialized
           when  a  function  is  entered  and then checked when the function exits.  If a guard check fails, an
           error message is printed and the program exits.  Only variables that are actually  allocated  on  the
           stack are considered, optimized away variables or variables allocated in registers don't count.

       <b>-fstack-protector-all</b>
           Like <b>-fstack-protector</b> except that all functions are protected.

       <b>-fstack-protector-strong</b>
           Like  <b>-fstack-protector</b>  but  includes additional functions to be protected --- those that have local
           array definitions, or have references to local frame addresses.  Only  variables  that  are  actually
           allocated  on  the stack are considered, optimized away variables or variables allocated in registers
           don't count.

       <b>-fstack-protector-explicit</b>
           Like <b>-fstack-protector</b> but only protects those functions which have the "stack_protect" attribute.

       <b>-fstack-check</b>
           Generate code to verify that you do not go beyond the boundary of the stack.  You should specify this
           flag if you are running in an environment with multiple threads, but you only rarely need to  specify
           it  in  a  single-threaded  environment  since stack overflow is automatically detected on nearly all
           systems if there is only one stack.

           Note that this switch does not actually cause checking to  be  done;  the  operating  system  or  the
           language  runtime  must  do  that.   The switch causes generation of code to ensure that they see the
           stack being extended.

           You can additionally specify a string parameter: <b>no</b> means no checking, <b>generic</b> means force the use of
           old-style checking,  <b>specific</b>  means  use  the  best  checking  method  and  is  equivalent  to  bare
           <b>-fstack-check</b>.

           Old-style  checking  is  a generic mechanism that requires no specific target support in the compiler
           but comes with the following drawbacks:

           1.  Modified allocation strategy for large objects: they are always allocated  dynamically  if  their
               size exceeds a fixed threshold.  Note this may change the semantics of some code.

           2.  Fixed  limit  on  the  size  of  the static frame of functions: when it is topped by a particular
               function, stack checking is not reliable and a warning is issued by the compiler.

           3.  Inefficiency: because of both the modified allocation strategy and  the  generic  implementation,
               code performance is hampered.

           Note  that old-style stack checking is also the fallback method for <b>specific</b> if no target support has
           been added in the compiler.

           <b>-fstack-check=</b> is designed for  Ada's  needs  to  detect  infinite  recursion  and  stack  overflows.
           <b>specific</b>  is  an excellent choice when compiling Ada code.  It is not generally sufficient to protect
           against stack-clash attacks.  To protect against those you want <b>-fstack-clash-protection</b>.

       <b>-fstack-clash-protection</b>
           Generate code to prevent stack clash style attacks.  When this option is enabled, the  compiler  will
           only  allocate  one  page  of  stack  space  at  a  time  and each page is accessed immediately after
           allocation.  Thus, it prevents allocations from jumping over any stack guard  page  provided  by  the
           operating system.

           Most   targets   do   not   fully   support  stack  clash  protection.   However,  on  those  targets
           <b>-fstack-clash-protection</b> will protect dynamic stack allocations.  <b>-fstack-clash-protection</b>  may  also
           provide    limited    protection    for   static   stack   allocations   if   the   target   supports
           <b>-fstack-check=specific</b>.

           NOTE: In Ubuntu 19.10 and later versions, <b>-fstack-clash-protection</b> is enabled by default for C,  C++,
           ObjC, ObjC++, unless <b>-fno-stack-clash-protection</b> is found.

       <b>-fstack-limit-register=</b><u>reg</u>
       <b>-fstack-limit-symbol=</b><u>sym</u>
       <b>-fno-stack-limit</b>
           Generate  code  to  ensure that the stack does not grow beyond a certain value, either the value of a
           register or the address of a symbol.  If a larger stack is required, a signal is raised at run  time.
           For  most  targets, the signal is raised before the stack overruns the boundary, so it is possible to
           catch the signal without taking special precautions.

           For instance, if the stack starts at absolute address <b>0x80000000</b> and grows downwards, you can use the
           flags <b>-fstack-limit-symbol=__stack_limit</b> and <b>-Wl,--defsym,__stack_limit=0x7ffe0000</b> to enforce a stack
           limit of 128KB.  Note that this may only work with the GNU linker.

           You can locally override stack limit checking by using the "no_stack_limit" function attribute.

       <b>-fsplit-stack</b>
           Generate code to automatically split the stack before it overflows.   The  resulting  program  has  a
           discontiguous  stack  which  can  only overflow if the program is unable to allocate any more memory.
           This is most useful when running threaded programs, as it is no longer necessary to calculate a  good
           stack  size  to  use for each thread.  This is currently only implemented for the x86 targets running
           GNU/Linux.

           When code compiled with <b>-fsplit-stack</b> calls code compiled without <b>-fsplit-stack</b>,  there  may  not  be
           much  stack  space  available  for  the latter code to run.  If compiling all code, including library
           code, with <b>-fsplit-stack</b> is not an option, then the linker can fix up these calls so  that  the  code
           compiled without <b>-fsplit-stack</b> always has a large stack.  Support for this is implemented in the gold
           linker in GNU binutils release 2.21 and later.

       <b>-fvtable-verify=</b>[<b>std</b>|<b>preinit</b>|<b>none</b>]
           This   option  is  only  available  when  compiling  C++  code.   It  turns  on  (or  off,  if  using
           <b>-fvtable-verify=none</b>) the security feature that verifies at run time, for every  virtual  call,  that
           the  vtable  pointer  through which the call is made is valid for the type of the object, and has not
           been corrupted or overwritten.  If an invalid vtable pointer is detected at run  time,  an  error  is
           reported and execution of the program is immediately halted.

           This  option  causes  run-time  data  structures  to  be built at program startup, which are used for
           verifying the vtable pointers.  The options <b>std</b> and <b>preinit</b> control the timing  of  when  these  data
           structures  are  built.  In both cases the data structures are built before execution reaches "main".
           Using <b>-fvtable-verify=std</b> causes the data structures to be built after  shared  libraries  have  been
           loaded and initialized.  <b>-fvtable-verify=preinit</b> causes them to be built before shared libraries have
           been loaded and initialized.

           If this option appears multiple times in the command line with different values specified, <b>none</b> takes
           highest priority over both <b>std</b> and <b>preinit</b>; <b>preinit</b> takes priority over <b>std</b>.

       <b>-fvtv-debug</b>
           When  used  in conjunction with <b>-fvtable-verify=std</b> or <b>-fvtable-verify=preinit</b>, causes debug versions
           of the runtime functions for the vtable verification feature to be called.  This flag also causes the
           compiler to log information about which vtable pointers it finds for each class.  This information is
           written to a file named <u>vtv_set_ptr_data.log</u> in the  directory  named  by  the  environment  variable
           <b>VTV_LOGS_DIR</b> if that is defined or the current working directory otherwise.

           Note:  This feature <u>appends</u> data to the log file. If you want a fresh log file, be sure to delete any
           existing one.

       <b>-fvtv-counts</b>
           This   is   a   debugging   flag.    When   used   in   conjunction   with   <b>-fvtable-verify=std</b>   or
           <b>-fvtable-verify=preinit</b>, this causes the compiler to keep track of the total number of virtual  calls
           it  encounters  and  the  number  of verifications it inserts.  It also counts the number of calls to
           certain run-time library functions that it inserts and logs this  information  for  each  compilation
           unit.  The compiler writes this information to a file named <u>vtv_count_data.log</u> in the directory named
           by  the  environment  variable  <b>VTV_LOGS_DIR</b>  if  that  is  defined  or the current working directory
           otherwise.  It also counts the size of the vtable pointer  sets  for  each  class,  and  writes  this
           information to <u>vtv_class_set_sizes.log</u> in the same directory.

           Note:   This  feature  <u>appends</u>  data to the log files.  To get fresh log files, be sure to delete any
           existing ones.

       <b>-finstrument-functions</b>
           Generate instrumentation calls for entry and exit to functions.  Just after function entry  and  just
           before  function  exit,  the following profiling functions are called with the address of the current
           function and its call site.  (On some platforms, "__builtin_return_address" does not work beyond  the
           current  function,  so  the  call  site  information  may not be available to the profiling functions
           otherwise.)

                   void __cyg_profile_func_enter (void *this_fn,
                                                  void *call_site);
                   void __cyg_profile_func_exit  (void *this_fn,
                                                  void *call_site);

           The first argument is the address of the start of the  current  function,  which  may  be  looked  up
           exactly in the symbol table.

           This  instrumentation  is  also done for functions expanded inline in other functions.  The profiling
           calls indicate where, conceptually, the inline function is  entered  and  exited.   This  means  that
           addressable  versions  of  such  functions  must  be  available.   If all your uses of a function are
           expanded inline, this may mean an additional expansion of code size.  If you use "extern  inline"  in
           your  C  code, an addressable version of such functions must be provided.  (This is normally the case
           anyway, but if you get lucky and the optimizer always expands the functions inline,  you  might  have
           gotten away without providing static copies.)

           A function may be given the attribute "no_instrument_function", in which case this instrumentation is
           not  done.   This  can  be used, for example, for the profiling functions listed above, high-priority
           interrupt routines, and any functions from which the profiling  functions  cannot  safely  be  called
           (perhaps signal handlers, if the profiling routines generate output or allocate memory).

       <b>-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=</b><u>file</u><b>,</b><u>file</u><b>,...</b>
           Set  the  list  of  functions  that  are  excluded  from  instrumentation  (see  the  description  of
           <b>-finstrument-functions</b>).  If the file that contains a function definition matches with one  of  <u>file</u>,
           then  that function is not instrumented.  The match is done on substrings: if the <u>file</u> parameter is a
           substring of the file name, it is considered to be a match.

           For example:

                   -finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=/bits/stl,include/sys

           excludes any inline function defined in files whose pathnames contain <u>/bits/stl</u> or <u>include/sys</u>.

           If, for some  reason,  you  want  to  include  letter  <b>,</b>  in  one  of  <u>sym</u>,  write  <b>,</b>.  For  example,
           <b>-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=',,tmp'</b> (note the single quote surrounding the option).

       <b>-finstrument-functions-exclude-function-list=</b><u>sym</u><b>,</b><u>sym</u><b>,...</b>
           This  is  similar  to  <b>-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list</b>,  but  this  option  sets the list of
           function names to be excluded from instrumentation.  The function name to be  matched  is  its  user-
           visible  name,  such as "vector&lt;int&gt; blah(const vector&lt;int&gt; &amp;)", not the internal mangled name (e.g.,
           "_Z4blahRSt6vectorIiSaIiEE").  The match is done on substrings: if the <u>sym</u> parameter is  a  substring
           of  the  function  name,  it  is considered to be a match.  For C99 and C++ extended identifiers, the
           function name must be given in UTF-8, not using universal character names.

       <b>-fpatchable-function-entry=</b><u>N</u><b>[,</b><u>M</u><b>]</b>
           Generate <u>N</u> NOPs right at the beginning of each function, with the function entry point before the <u>M</u>th
           NOP.  If <u>M</u> is omitted, it defaults to 0 so the function entry points to the address just at the first
           NOP.  The NOP  instructions  reserve  extra  space  which  can  be  used  to  patch  in  any  desired
           instrumentation  at  run  time,  provided  that the code segment is writable.  The amount of space is
           controllable indirectly via the  number  of  NOPs;  the  NOP  instruction  used  corresponds  to  the
           instruction  emitted  by  the  internal  GCC  back-end interface "gen_nop".  This behavior is target-
           specific and may also depend on the architecture variant and/or other compilation options.

           For run-time identification, the starting  addresses  of  these  areas,  which  correspond  to  their
           respective function entries minus <u>M</u>, are additionally collected in the "__patchable_function_entries"
           section of the resulting binary.

           Note  that  the  value  of  "__attribute__  ((patchable_function_entry (N,M)))" takes precedence over
           command-line option <b>-fpatchable-function-entry=N,M</b>.  This can be used to increase the area size or to
           remove it completely on a single function.  If "N=0", no pad location is recorded.

           The NOP instructions are inserted at---and maybe before, depending on <u>M</u>---the function entry address,
           even before the prologue.

           The maximum value of <u>N</u> and <u>M</u> is 65535.

   <b>Options</b> <b>Controlling</b> <b>the</b> <b>Preprocessor</b>
       These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on each C source file before actual compilation.

       If you use the <b>-E</b> option, nothing is done except preprocessing.  Some of these options  make  sense  only
       together with <b>-E</b> because they cause the preprocessor output to be unsuitable for actual compilation.

       In addition to the options listed here, there are a number of options to control search paths for include
       files documented in <b>Directory</b> <b>Options</b>.  Options to control preprocessor diagnostics are listed in <b>Warning</b>
       <b>Options</b>.

       <b>-D</b> <u>name</u>
           Predefine <u>name</u> as a macro, with definition 1.

       <b>-D</b> <u>name</u><b>=</b><u>definition</u>
           The  contents  of <u>definition</u> are tokenized and processed as if they appeared during translation phase
           three in a <b>#define</b> directive.  In  particular,  the  definition  is  truncated  by  embedded  newline
           characters.

           If  you  are  invoking  the  preprocessor  from a shell or shell-like program you may need to use the
           shell's quoting syntax to protect characters such as spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax.

           If you wish to define a function-like macro on  the  command  line,  write  its  argument  list  with
           surrounding  parentheses before the equals sign (if any).  Parentheses are meaningful to most shells,
           so you should quote the option.  With <b>sh</b> and <b>csh</b>, <b>-D'</b><u>name</u><b>(</b><u>args...</u><b>)=</b><u>definition</u><b>'</b> works.

           <b>-D</b> and <b>-U</b> options are processed in the order they are given on the command line.  All  <b>-imacros</b>  <u>file</u>
           and <b>-include</b> <u>file</u> options are processed after all <b>-D</b> and <b>-U</b> options.

       <b>-U</b> <u>name</u>
           Cancel any previous definition of <u>name</u>, either built in or provided with a <b>-D</b> option.

       <b>-include</b> <u>file</u>
           Process <u>file</u> as if "#include "file"" appeared as the first line of the primary source file.  However,
           the  first  directory  searched  for  <u>file</u>  is  the  preprocessor's  working directory <u>instead</u> <u>of</u> the
           directory containing the main source file.  If not found there, it is searched for in  the  remainder
           of the "#include "..."" search chain as normal.

           If  multiple  <b>-include</b>  options  are  given,  the  files are included in the order they appear on the
           command line.

       <b>-imacros</b> <u>file</u>
           Exactly like <b>-include</b>, except that any output produced by scanning <u>file</u> is thrown  away.   Macros  it
           defines  remain  defined.   This  allows  you  to  acquire  all the macros from a header without also
           processing its declarations.

           All files specified by <b>-imacros</b> are processed before all files specified by <b>-include</b>.

       <b>-undef</b>
           Do not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros.  The standard predefined  macros  remain
           defined.

       <b>-pthread</b>
           Define  additional  macros  required for using the POSIX threads library.  You should use this option
           consistently for both compilation and linking.  This option is supported on GNU/Linux  targets,  most
           other Unix derivatives, and also on x86 Cygwin and MinGW targets.

       <b>-M</b>  Instead  of  outputting  the  result of preprocessing, output a rule suitable for <b>make</b> describing the
           dependencies of the main source file.  The preprocessor outputs one <b>make</b> rule containing  the  object
           file  name  for  that  source file, a colon, and the names of all the included files, including those
           coming from <b>-include</b> or <b>-imacros</b> command-line options.

           Unless specified explicitly (with <b>-MT</b> or <b>-MQ</b>), the object file name  consists  of  the  name  of  the
           source  file  with  any  suffix replaced with object file suffix and with any leading directory parts
           removed.  If there are many included files then the rule is split into several lines using <b>\</b>-newline.
           The rule has no commands.

           This option does not suppress the preprocessor's debug output, such as <b>-dM</b>.   To  avoid  mixing  such
           debug  output with the dependency rules you should explicitly specify the dependency output file with
           <b>-MF</b>, or use an environment variable like <b>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</b>.  Debug output  is  still  sent  to  the
           regular output stream as normal.

           Passing <b>-M</b> to the driver implies <b>-E</b>, and suppresses warnings with an implicit <b>-w</b>.

       <b>-MM</b> Like <b>-M</b> but do not mention header files that are found in system header directories, nor header files
           that are included, directly or indirectly, from such a header.

           This  implies that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in an <b>#include</b> directive does not in
           itself determine whether that header appears in <b>-MM</b> dependency output.

       <b>-MF</b> <u>file</u>
           When used with <b>-M</b> or <b>-MM</b>, specifies a file to write the dependencies to.  If no <b>-MF</b> switch  is  given
           the preprocessor sends the rules to the same place it would send preprocessed output.

           When used with the driver options <b>-MD</b> or <b>-MMD</b>, <b>-MF</b> overrides the default dependency output file.

           If <u>file</u> is <u>-</u>, then the dependencies are written to <u>stdout</u>.

       <b>-MG</b> In conjunction with an option such as <b>-M</b> requesting dependency generation, <b>-MG</b> assumes missing header
           files  are  generated  files  and  adds  them  to  the dependency list without raising an error.  The
           dependency filename is taken directly from the "#include" directive without prepending any path.  <b>-MG</b>
           also suppresses preprocessed output, as a missing header file renders this useless.

           This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.

       <b>-Mno-modules</b>
           Disable dependency generation for compiled module interfaces.

       <b>-MP</b> This option instructs CPP to add a phony target for each dependency other than the main file, causing
           each to depend on nothing.  These dummy rules work around errors <b>make</b>  gives  if  you  remove  header
           files without updating the <u>Makefile</u> to match.

           This is typical output:

                   test.o: test.c test.h

                   test.h:

       <b>-MT</b> <u>target</u>
           Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency generation.  By default CPP takes the name of the
           main  input  file,  deletes  any directory components and any file suffix such as <b>.c</b>, and appends the
           platform's usual object suffix.  The result is the target.

           An <b>-MT</b> option sets the target to be exactly the string you specify.  If you  want  multiple  targets,
           you can specify them as a single argument to <b>-MT</b>, or use multiple <b>-MT</b> options.

           For example, <b>-MT</b> <b>'$(objpfx)foo.o'</b> might give

                   $(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c

       <b>-MQ</b> <u>target</u>
           Same as <b>-MT</b>, but it quotes any characters which are special to Make.  <b>-MQ</b> <b>'$(objpfx)foo.o'</b> gives

                   $$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c

           The default target is automatically quoted, as if it were given with <b>-MQ</b>.

       <b>-MD</b> <b>-MD</b> is equivalent to <b>-M</b> <b>-MF</b> <u>file</u>, except that <b>-E</b> is not implied.  The driver determines <u>file</u> based on
           whether  an  <b>-o</b>  option  is  given.   If it is, the driver uses its argument but with a suffix of <u>.d</u>,
           otherwise it takes the name of the input file, removes  any  directory  components  and  suffix,  and
           applies a <u>.d</u> suffix.

           If  <b>-MD</b>  is used in conjunction with <b>-E</b>, any <b>-o</b> switch is understood to specify the dependency output
           file, but if used without <b>-E</b>, each <b>-o</b> is understood to specify a target object file.

           Since <b>-E</b> is not implied, <b>-MD</b> can be used to generate a dependency output file as a side effect of the
           compilation process.

       <b>-MMD</b>
           Like <b>-MD</b> except mention only user header files, not system header files.

       <b>-fpreprocessed</b>
           Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has  already  been  preprocessed.   This  suppresses
           things  like  macro  expansion, trigraph conversion, escaped newline splicing, and processing of most
           directives.  The preprocessor still recognizes and removes comments, so that  you  can  pass  a  file
           preprocessed  with  <b>-C</b> to the compiler without problems.  In this mode the integrated preprocessor is
           little more than a tokenizer for the front ends.

           <b>-fpreprocessed</b> is implicit if the input file has one of the extensions <b>.i</b>, <b>.ii</b> or <b>.mi</b>.  These are the
           extensions that GCC uses for preprocessed files created by <b>-save-temps</b>.

       <b>-fdirectives-only</b>
           When preprocessing, handle directives, but do not expand macros.

           The option's behavior depends on the <b>-E</b> and <b>-fpreprocessed</b> options.

           With <b>-E</b>, preprocessing is limited to the handling of directives  such  as  "#define",  "#ifdef",  and
           "#error".   Other  preprocessor  operations,  such as macro expansion and trigraph conversion are not
           performed.  In addition, the <b>-dD</b> option is implicitly enabled.

           With <b>-fpreprocessed</b>, predefinition of command line and most builtin macros is disabled.  Macros  such
           as  "__LINE__",  which are contextually dependent, are handled normally.  This enables compilation of
           files previously preprocessed with "-E -fdirectives-only".

           With both <b>-E</b> and <b>-fpreprocessed</b>, the rules for <b>-fpreprocessed</b> take  precedence.   This  enables  full
           preprocessing of files previously preprocessed with "-E -fdirectives-only".

       <b>-fdollars-in-identifiers</b>
           Accept <b>$</b> in identifiers.

       <b>-fextended-identifiers</b>
           Accept  universal  character names and extended characters in identifiers.  This option is enabled by
           default for C99 (and later C standard versions) and C++.

       <b>-fno-canonical-system-headers</b>
           When preprocessing, do not shorten system header paths with canonicalization.

       <b>-fmax-include-depth=</b><u>depth</u>
           Set the maximum depth of the nested #include. The default is 200.

       <b>-ftabstop=</b><u>width</u>
           Set the distance between tab stops.  This helps the preprocessor report  correct  column  numbers  in
           warnings  or  errors,  even  if tabs appear on the line.  If the value is less than 1 or greater than
           100, the option is ignored.  The default is 8.

       <b>-ftrack-macro-expansion</b>[<b>=</b><u>level</u>]
           Track locations of tokens across macro expansions. This allows the compiler to emit diagnostic  about
           the  current  macro  expansion stack when a compilation error occurs in a macro expansion. Using this
           option makes the preprocessor and the compiler consume more memory. The <u>level</u> parameter can  be  used
           to choose the level of precision of token location tracking thus decreasing the memory consumption if
           necessary.  Value  <b>0</b> of <u>level</u> de-activates this option. Value <b>1</b> tracks tokens locations in a degraded
           mode for the sake of minimal memory overhead. In this mode all tokens resulting from the expansion of
           an argument of a function-like macro  have  the  same  location.  Value  <b>2</b>  tracks  tokens  locations
           completely. This value is the most memory hungry.  When this option is given no argument, the default
           parameter value is <b>2</b>.

           Note that "-ftrack-macro-expansion=2" is activated by default.

       <b>-fmacro-prefix-map=</b><u>old</u><b>=</b><u>new</u>
           When  preprocessing files residing in directory <u>old</u>, expand the "__FILE__" and "__BASE_FILE__" macros
           as if the files resided in directory <u>new</u> instead.  This can be used to change an absolute path  to  a
           relative  path  by  using  <u>.</u>  for  <u>new</u> which can result in more reproducible builds that are location
           independent.   This  option  also  affects   "__builtin_FILE()"   during   compilation.    See   also
           <b>-ffile-prefix-map</b>.

       <b>-fexec-charset=</b><u>charset</u>
           Set  the  execution  character  set,  used for string and character constants.  The default is UTF-8.
           <u>charset</u> can be any encoding supported by the system's "iconv" library routine.

       <b>-fwide-exec-charset=</b><u>charset</u>
           Set the wide execution character set, used for wide string and character constants.  The  default  is
           one of UTF-32BE, UTF-32LE, UTF-16BE, or UTF-16LE, whichever corresponds to the width of "wchar_t" and
           the  big-endian  or little-endian byte order being used for code generation.  As with <b>-fexec-charset</b>,
           <u>charset</u> can be any encoding supported by the system's "iconv" library routine; however, you will have
           problems with encodings that do not fit exactly in "wchar_t".

       <b>-finput-charset=</b><u>charset</u>
           Set the input character set, used for translation from the character set of the  input  file  to  the
           source character set used by GCC.  If the locale does not specify, or GCC cannot get this information
           from  the locale, the default is UTF-8.  This can be overridden by either the locale or this command-
           line option.  Currently the command-line option takes precedence if there's a conflict.  <u>charset</u>  can
           be any encoding supported by the system's "iconv" library routine.

       <b>-fpch-deps</b>
           When  using  precompiled headers, this flag causes the dependency-output flags to also list the files
           from the precompiled header's dependencies.  If not specified, only the precompiled header are listed
           and not the files that were used to  create  it,  because  those  files  are  not  consulted  when  a
           precompiled header is used.

       <b>-fpch-preprocess</b>
           This  option  allows  use  of a precompiled header together with <b>-E</b>.  It inserts a special "#pragma",
           "#pragma GCC pch_preprocess "<u>filename</u>"" in the output to mark the place where the precompiled  header
           was  found, and its <u>filename</u>.  When <b>-fpreprocessed</b> is in use, GCC recognizes this "#pragma" and loads
           the PCH.

           This option is off by default, because the resulting preprocessed output is only really  suitable  as
           input to GCC.  It is switched on by <b>-save-temps</b>.

           You  should not write this "#pragma" in your own code, but it is safe to edit the filename if the PCH
           file is available in a different location.  The filename may be absolute or it  may  be  relative  to
           GCC's current directory.

       <b>-fworking-directory</b>
           Enable  generation  of  linemarkers in the preprocessor output that let the compiler know the current
           working directory at the time of preprocessing.  When this option is enabled, the preprocessor emits,
           after the initial linemarker, a second linemarker with the current working directory followed by  two
           slashes.   GCC  uses  this  directory,  when it's present in the preprocessed input, as the directory
           emitted as the current working directory in some  debugging  information  formats.   This  option  is
           implicitly  enabled  if  debugging information is enabled, but this can be inhibited with the negated
           form <b>-fno-working-directory</b>.  If the <b>-P</b> flag is present in the  command  line,  this  option  has  no
           effect, since no "#line" directives are emitted whatsoever.

       <b>-A</b> <u>predicate</u><b>=</b><u>answer</u>
           Make  an  assertion  with  the  predicate <u>predicate</u> and answer <u>answer</u>.  This form is preferred to the
           older form <b>-A</b> <u>predicate</u><b>(</b><u>answer</u><b>)</b>, which is still supported, because it  does  not  use  shell  special
           characters.

       <b>-A</b> <b>-</b><u>predicate</u><b>=</b><u>answer</u>
           Cancel an assertion with the predicate <u>predicate</u> and answer <u>answer</u>.

       <b>-C</b>  Do  not discard comments.  All comments are passed through to the output file, except for comments in
           processed directives, which are deleted along with the directive.

           You should be prepared for side effects when using <b>-C</b>; it causes the preprocessor to  treat  comments
           as  tokens  in  their  own  right.   For  example, comments appearing at the start of what would be a
           directive line have the effect of turning that line into an ordinary source  line,  since  the  first
           token on the line is no longer a <b>#</b>.

       <b>-CC</b> Do  not  discard  comments,  including during macro expansion.  This is like <b>-C</b>, except that comments
           contained within macros are also passed through to the output file where the macro is expanded.

           In addition to the side effects of the <b>-C</b> option, the <b>-CC</b> option causes all C++-style comments inside
           a macro to be converted to C-style comments.  This is  to  prevent  later  use  of  that  macro  from
           inadvertently commenting out the remainder of the source line.

           The <b>-CC</b> option is generally used to support lint comments.

       <b>-P</b>  Inhibit  generation  of  linemarkers  in the output from the preprocessor.  This might be useful when
           running the preprocessor on something that is not C code, and will be sent to a program  which  might
           be confused by the linemarkers.

       <b>-traditional</b>
       <b>-traditional-cpp</b>
           Try  to imitate the behavior of pre-standard C preprocessors, as opposed to ISO C preprocessors.  See
           the GNU CPP manual for details.

           Note that GCC does not otherwise attempt to emulate a pre-standard C compiler, and these options  are
           only supported with the <b>-E</b> switch, or when invoking CPP explicitly.

       <b>-trigraphs</b>
           Support ISO C trigraphs.  These are three-character sequences, all starting with <b>??</b>, that are defined
           by  ISO  C  to  stand for single characters.  For example, <b>??/</b> stands for <b>\</b>, so <b>'??/n'</b> is a character
           constant for a newline.

           The nine trigraphs and their replacements are

                   Trigraph:       ??(  ??)  ??&lt;  ??&gt;  ??=  ??/  ??'  ??!  ??-
                   Replacement:      [    ]    {    }    #    \    ^    |    ~

           By default, GCC ignores trigraphs, but in standard-conforming modes it converts them.  See  the  <b>-std</b>
           and <b>-ansi</b> options.

       <b>-remap</b>
           Enable  special code to work around file systems which only permit very short file names, such as MS-
           DOS.

       <b>-H</b>  Print the name of each header file used, in addition  to  other  normal  activities.   Each  name  is
           indented  to  show  how deep in the <b>#include</b> stack it is.  Precompiled header files are also printed,
           even if they are found to be invalid; an invalid precompiled header file is printed with <b>...x</b>  and  a
           valid one with <b>...!</b> .

       <b>-d</b><u>letters</u>
           Says  to  make debugging dumps during compilation as specified by <u>letters</u>.  The flags documented here
           are those relevant to the preprocessor.  Other <u>letters</u> are interpreted by  the  compiler  proper,  or
           reserved  for  future  versions  of  GCC,  and so are silently ignored.  If you specify <u>letters</u> whose
           behavior conflicts, the result is undefined.

           <b>-dM</b> Instead of the normal output, generate a list of <b>#define</b> directives for all  the  macros  defined
               during  the  execution of the preprocessor, including predefined macros.  This gives you a way of
               finding out what is predefined in your version of the preprocessor.  Assuming you  have  no  file
               <u>foo.h</u>, the command

                       touch foo.h; cpp -dM foo.h

               shows all the predefined macros.

               If you use <b>-dM</b> without the <b>-E</b> option, <b>-dM</b> is interpreted as a synonym for <b>-fdump-rtl-mach</b>.

           <b>-dD</b> Like  <b>-dM</b>  except in two respects: it does <u>not</u> include the predefined macros, and it outputs <u>both</u>
               the <b>#define</b> directives and the result of preprocessing.  Both kinds of output go to the  standard
               output file.

           <b>-dN</b> Like <b>-dD</b>, but emit only the macro names, not their expansions.

           <b>-dI</b> Output <b>#include</b> directives in addition to the result of preprocessing.

           <b>-dU</b> Like  <b>-dD</b>  except  that  only  macros  that  are  expanded,  or  whose  definedness  is tested in
               preprocessor directives, are output; the output is delayed until the use or test  of  the  macro;
               and <b>#undef</b> directives are also output for macros tested but undefined at the time.

       <b>-fdebug-cpp</b>
           This  option  is  only  useful  for debugging GCC.  When used from CPP or with <b>-E</b>, it dumps debugging
           information about location maps.  Every token in the output is preceded by the dump of  the  map  its
           location belongs to.

           When used from GCC without <b>-E</b>, this option has no effect.

       <b>-Wp,</b><u>option</u>
           You  can  use  <b>-Wp,</b><u>option</u>  to  bypass  the  compiler  driver  and pass <u>option</u> directly through to the
           preprocessor.  If <u>option</u> contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.   However,
           many  options  are  modified, translated or interpreted by the compiler driver before being passed to
           the preprocessor, and <b>-Wp</b> forcibly bypasses this  phase.   The  preprocessor's  direct  interface  is
           undocumented  and  subject  to  change,  so  whenever possible you should avoid using <b>-Wp</b> and let the
           driver handle the options instead.

       <b>-Xpreprocessor</b> <u>option</u>
           Pass <u>option</u> as  an  option  to  the  preprocessor.   You  can  use  this  to  supply  system-specific
           preprocessor options that GCC does not recognize.

           If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use <b>-Xpreprocessor</b> twice, once for the
           option and once for the argument.

       <b>-no-integrated-cpp</b>
           Perform  preprocessing as a separate pass before compilation.  By default, GCC performs preprocessing
           as an integrated part of input tokenization and parsing.  If this option is provided, the appropriate
           language front end (<b>cc1</b>, <b>cc1plus</b>, or <b>cc1obj</b> for C, C++, and  Objective-C,  respectively)  is  instead
           invoked twice, once for preprocessing only and once for actual compilation of the preprocessed input.
           This  option  may  be  useful  in conjunction with the <b>-B</b> or <b>-wrapper</b> options to specify an alternate
           preprocessor or perform additional processing of the program source between normal preprocessing  and
           compilation.

       <b>-flarge-source-files</b>
           Adjust  GCC  to  expect  large  source  files, at the expense of slower compilation and higher memory
           usage.

           Specifically, GCC normally tracks both column numbers and line numbers within  source  files  and  it
           normally  prints  both  of  these  numbers  in diagnostics.  However, once it has processed a certain
           number of source lines, it stops tracking column numbers and only tracks line  numbers.   This  means
           that  diagnostics  for  later  lines  do not include column numbers.  It also means that options like
           <b>-Wmisleading-indentation</b> cease to work at that point, although the compiler prints  a  note  if  this
           happens.   Passing  <b>-flarge-source-files</b>  significantly increases the number of source lines that GCC
           can process before it stops tracking columns.

   <b>Passing</b> <b>Options</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Assembler</b>
       You can pass options to the assembler.

       <b>-Wa,</b><u>option</u>
           Pass <u>option</u> as an option to the assembler.  If <u>option</u> contains commas,  it  is  split  into  multiple
           options at the commas.

       <b>-Xassembler</b> <u>option</u>
           Pass  <u>option</u>  as  an  option  to the assembler.  You can use this to supply system-specific assembler
           options that GCC does not recognize.

           If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use <b>-Xassembler</b> twice,  once  for  the
           option and once for the argument.

   <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>Linking</b>
       These  options  come into play when the compiler links object files into an executable output file.  They
       are meaningless if the compiler is not doing a link step.

       <u>object-file-name</u>
           A file name that does not end in a special recognized suffix is considered to name an object file  or
           library.   (Object  files  are  distinguished  from  libraries  by  the  linker according to the file
           contents.)  If linking is done, these object files are used as input to the linker.

       <b>-c</b>
       <b>-S</b>
       <b>-E</b>  If any of these options is used, then the linker is not run, and object file names should not be used
           as arguments.

       <b>-flinker-output=</b><u>type</u>
           This option controls code generation of the link-time optimizer.  By default  the  linker  output  is
           automatically determined by the linker plugin.  For debugging the compiler and if incremental linking
           with a non-LTO object file is desired, it may be useful to control the type manually.

           If  <u>type</u>  is  <b>exec</b>,  code  generation produces a static binary. In this case <b>-fpic</b> and <b>-fpie</b> are both
           disabled.

           If <u>type</u> is <b>dyn</b>, code generation produces a shared library.  In this case <b>-fpic</b> or <b>-fPIC</b> is preserved,
           but not enabled automatically.  This allows to build shared  libraries  without  position-independent
           code on architectures where this is possible, i.e. on x86.

           If  <u>type</u>  is <b>pie</b>, code generation produces an <b>-fpie</b> executable. This results in similar optimizations
           as <b>exec</b> except that <b>-fpie</b> is not disabled if specified at compilation time.

           If <u>type</u> is <b>rel</b>, the compiler assumes that incremental  linking  is  done.   The  sections  containing
           intermediate  code  for link-time optimization are merged, pre-optimized, and output to the resulting
           object file. In addition, if <b>-ffat-lto-objects</b> is specified, binary code is produced for future  non-
           LTO  linking.  The  object  file  produced  by  incremental  linking is smaller than a static library
           produced from the same object files.  At link time the  result  of  incremental  linking  also  loads
           faster than a static library assuming that the majority of objects in the library are used.

           Finally  <b>nolto-rel</b> configures the compiler for incremental linking where code generation is forced, a
           final binary is produced, and the intermediate code for later  link-time  optimization  is  stripped.
           When multiple object files are linked together the resulting code is better optimized than with link-
           time  optimizations  disabled  (for  example, cross-module inlining happens), but most of benefits of
           whole program optimizations are lost.

           During the incremental link (by <b>-r</b>) the linker plugin defaults to <b>rel</b>. With current interfaces to GNU
           Binutils it is however not possible to incrementally link LTO objects  and  non-LTO  objects  into  a
           single  mixed  object  file.  If any of object files in incremental link cannot be used for link-time
           optimization, the linker plugin issues a warning  and  uses  <b>nolto-rel</b>.  To  maintain  whole  program
           optimization, it is recommended to link such objects into static library instead. Alternatively it is
           possible to use H.J. Lu's binutils with support for mixed objects.

       <b>-fuse-ld=bfd</b>
           Use the <b>bfd</b> linker instead of the default linker.

       <b>-fuse-ld=gold</b>
           Use the <b>gold</b> linker instead of the default linker.

       <b>-fuse-ld=lld</b>
           Use the LLVM <b>lld</b> linker instead of the default linker.

       <b>-fuse-ld=mold</b>
           Use the Modern Linker (<b>mold</b>) instead of the default linker.

       <b>-l</b><u>library</u>
       <b>-l</b> <u>library</u>
           Search  the  library  named  <u>library</u>  when  linking.   (The  second alternative with the library as a
           separate argument is only for POSIX compliance and is not recommended.)

           The <b>-l</b> option is passed directly to the linker by GCC.  Refer to your linker documentation for  exact
           details.  The general description below applies to the GNU linker.

           The linker searches a standard list of directories for the library.  The directories searched include
           several standard system directories plus any that you specify with <b>-L</b>.

           Static  libraries  are archives of object files, and have file names like <u>liblibrary.a</u>.  Some targets
           also support shared libraries, which typically have names like <u>liblibrary.so</u>.   If  both  static  and
           shared libraries are found, the linker gives preference to linking with the shared library unless the
           <b>-static</b> option is used.

           It  makes  a difference where in the command you write this option; the linker searches and processes
           libraries and object files in the order they are specified.  Thus, <b>foo.o</b> <b>-lz</b> <b>bar.o</b> searches library <b>z</b>
           after file <u>foo.o</u> but before <u>bar.o</u>.  If <u>bar.o</u> refers to functions in <b>z</b>, those  functions  may  not  be
           loaded.

       <b>-lobjc</b>
           You need this special case of the <b>-l</b> option in order to link an Objective-C or Objective-C++ program.

       <b>-nostartfiles</b>
           Do  not  use  the standard system startup files when linking.  The standard system libraries are used
           normally, unless <b>-nostdlib</b>, <b>-nolibc</b>, or <b>-nodefaultlibs</b> is used.

       <b>-nodefaultlibs</b>
           Do not use the standard system libraries when linking.  Only the libraries you specify are passed  to
           the  linker,  and  options  specifying  linkage  of  the  system libraries, such as <b>-static-libgcc</b> or
           <b>-shared-libgcc</b>, are ignored.  The standard startup files are used normally, unless  <b>-nostartfiles</b>  is
           used.

           The  compiler  may  generate  calls to "memcmp", "memset", "memcpy" and "memmove".  These entries are
           usually resolved by entries in libc.  These entry  points  should  be  supplied  through  some  other
           mechanism when this option is specified.

       <b>-nolibc</b>
           Do  not  use the C library or system libraries tightly coupled with it when linking.  Still link with
           the startup files,  <u>libgcc</u>  or  toolchain  provided  language  support  libraries  such  as  <u>libgnat</u>,
           <u>libgfortran</u>  or <u>libstdc++</u> unless options preventing their inclusion are used as well.  This typically
           removes <b>-lc</b> from the link command line, as well as system libraries that  normally  go  with  it  and
           become  meaningless  when  absence  of  a  C library is assumed, for example <b>-lpthread</b> or <b>-lm</b> in some
           configurations.  This is intended for bare-board targets when there is indeed no C library available.

       <b>-nostdlib</b>
           Do not use the standard system startup files or libraries when linking.  No startup  files  and  only
           the  libraries  you  specify  are  passed to the linker, and options specifying linkage of the system
           libraries, such as <b>-static-libgcc</b> or <b>-shared-libgcc</b>, are ignored.

           The compiler may generate calls to "memcmp", "memset", "memcpy" and  "memmove".   These  entries  are
           usually  resolved  by  entries  in  libc.   These  entry points should be supplied through some other
           mechanism when this option is specified.

           One of the standard libraries bypassed by <b>-nostdlib</b> and <b>-nodefaultlibs</b>  is  <u>libgcc.a</u>,  a  library  of
           internal subroutines which GCC uses to overcome shortcomings of particular machines, or special needs
           for some languages.

           In  most  cases,  you  need  <u>libgcc.a</u> even when you want to avoid other standard libraries.  In other
           words, when you specify <b>-nostdlib</b> or <b>-nodefaultlibs</b> you should usually specify <b>-lgcc</b> as  well.   This
           ensures  that  you have no unresolved references to internal GCC library subroutines.  (An example of
           such an internal subroutine is "__main", used to ensure C++ constructors are called.)

       <b>-e</b> <u>entry</u>
       <b>--entry=</b><u>entry</u>
           Specify that the program entry point is <u>entry</u>.  The argument is interpreted by the  linker;  the  GNU
           linker accepts either a symbol name or an address.

       <b>-pie</b>
           Produce  a  dynamically  linked  position  independent  executable  on  targets that support it.  For
           predictable results, you must also specify the same set  of  options  used  for  compilation  (<b>-fpie</b>,
           <b>-fPIE</b>, or model suboptions) when you specify this linker option.

       <b>-no-pie</b>
           Don't produce a dynamically linked position independent executable.

       <b>-static-pie</b>
           Produce  a  static  position  independent  executable  on targets that support it.  A static position
           independent executable is similar to a static executable, but can be loaded at any address without  a
           dynamic  linker.   For  predictable  results,  you must also specify the same set of options used for
           compilation (<b>-fpie</b>, <b>-fPIE</b>, or model suboptions) when you specify this linker option.

       <b>-pthread</b>
           Link with the POSIX threads library.  This option is supported on GNU/Linux targets, most other  Unix
           derivatives,  and  also on x86 Cygwin and MinGW targets.  On some targets this option also sets flags
           for the preprocessor, so it should be used consistently for both compilation and linking.

       <b>-r</b>  Produce a relocatable object as output.  This is also known as partial linking.

       <b>-rdynamic</b>
           Pass the flag <b>-export-dynamic</b> to the ELF linker, on targets  that  support  it.  This  instructs  the
           linker to add all symbols, not only used ones, to the dynamic symbol table. This option is needed for
           some uses of "dlopen" or to allow obtaining backtraces from within a program.

       <b>-s</b>  Remove all symbol table and relocation information from the executable.

       <b>-static</b>
           On  systems  that  support  dynamic linking, this overrides <b>-pie</b> and prevents linking with the shared
           libraries.  On other systems, this option has no effect.

       <b>-shared</b>
           Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other objects to form an executable.   Not  all
           systems  support this option.  For predictable results, you must also specify the same set of options
           used for compilation (<b>-fpic</b>, <b>-fPIC</b>, or model suboptions) when you specify this linker option.[1]

       <b>-shared-libgcc</b>
       <b>-static-libgcc</b>
           On systems that provide <u>libgcc</u> as a shared library, these options force the use of either the  shared
           or  static  version,  respectively.   If  no shared version of <u>libgcc</u> was built when the compiler was
           configured, these options have no effect.

           There are several situations in which an application should use the  shared  <u>libgcc</u>  instead  of  the
           static  version.   The  most  common  of  these  is  when  the  application wishes to throw and catch
           exceptions across different shared libraries.  In that case, each of the libraries  as  well  as  the
           application itself should use the shared <u>libgcc</u>.

           Therefore,  the G++ driver automatically adds <b>-shared-libgcc</b> whenever you build a shared library or a
           main executable, because C++ programs typically use exceptions, so this is the right thing to do.

           If, instead, you use the GCC driver to create shared libraries, you may find that they are not always
           linked with the shared <u>libgcc</u>.  If GCC finds, at its configuration time,  that  you  have  a  non-GNU
           linker  or  a  GNU linker that does not support option <b>--eh-frame-hdr</b>, it links the shared version of
           <u>libgcc</u> into shared libraries by default.  Otherwise, it takes advantage of the linker  and  optimizes
           away  the  linking  with  the  shared version of <u>libgcc</u>, linking with the static version of libgcc by
           default.  This allows exceptions to  propagate  through  such  shared  libraries,  without  incurring
           relocation costs at library load time.

           However,  if  a library or main executable is supposed to throw or catch exceptions, you must link it
           using the G++ driver, or using the option <b>-shared-libgcc</b>, such that it  is  linked  with  the  shared
           <u>libgcc</u>.

       <b>-static-libasan</b>
           When  the  <b>-fsanitize=address</b>  option  is  used to link a program, the GCC driver automatically links
           against <b>libasan</b>.  If <u>libasan</u> is available as a shared library, and the <b>-static</b> option  is  not  used,
           then  this  links  against the shared version of <u>libasan</u>.  The <b>-static-libasan</b> option directs the GCC
           driver to link <u>libasan</u> statically, without necessarily linking other libraries statically.

       <b>-static-libtsan</b>
           When the <b>-fsanitize=thread</b> option is used to link a  program,  the  GCC  driver  automatically  links
           against  <b>libtsan</b>.   If  <u>libtsan</u> is available as a shared library, and the <b>-static</b> option is not used,
           then this links against the shared version of <u>libtsan</u>.  The <b>-static-libtsan</b> option  directs  the  GCC
           driver to link <u>libtsan</u> statically, without necessarily linking other libraries statically.

       <b>-static-liblsan</b>
           When the <b>-fsanitize=leak</b> option is used to link a program, the GCC driver automatically links against
           <b>liblsan</b>.   If <u>liblsan</u> is available as a shared library, and the <b>-static</b> option is not used, then this
           links against the shared version of <u>liblsan</u>.  The <b>-static-liblsan</b> option directs the  GCC  driver  to
           link <u>liblsan</u> statically, without necessarily linking other libraries statically.

       <b>-static-libubsan</b>
           When  the  <b>-fsanitize=undefined</b>  option is used to link a program, the GCC driver automatically links
           against <b>libubsan</b>.  If <u>libubsan</u> is available as a shared library, and the <b>-static</b> option is not  used,
           then  this links against the shared version of <u>libubsan</u>.  The <b>-static-libubsan</b> option directs the GCC
           driver to link <u>libubsan</u> statically, without necessarily linking other libraries statically.

       <b>-static-libstdc++</b>
           When the <b>g++</b> program is used  to  link  a  C++  program,  it  normally  automatically  links  against
           <b>libstdc++</b>.   If  <u>libstdc++</u> is available as a shared library, and the <b>-static</b> option is not used, then
           this links against the shared version of <u>libstdc++</u>.  That is normally fine.  However, it is sometimes
           useful to freeze the version of <u>libstdc++</u> used by the program without going all the way  to  a  fully
           static  link.   The  <b>-static-libstdc++</b>  option  directs  the <b>g++</b> driver to link <u>libstdc++</u> statically,
           without necessarily linking other libraries statically.

       <b>-symbolic</b>
           Bind references to global  symbols  when  building  a  shared  object.   Warn  about  any  unresolved
           references  (unless  overridden  by  the  link  editor option <b>-Xlinker</b> <b>-z</b> <b>-Xlinker</b> <b>defs</b>).  Only a few
           systems support this option.

       <b>-T</b> <u>script</u>
           Use <u>script</u> as the linker script.  This option is supported by most systems using the GNU linker.   On
           some  targets,  such as bare-board targets without an operating system, the <b>-T</b> option may be required
           when linking to avoid references to undefined symbols.

       <b>-Xlinker</b> <u>option</u>
           Pass <u>option</u> as an option to the linker.  You can use this to supply  system-specific  linker  options
           that GCC does not recognize.

           If  you  want to pass an option that takes a separate argument, you must use <b>-Xlinker</b> twice, once for
           the option and once for the argument.  For example, to  pass  <b>-assert</b>  <b>definitions</b>,  you  must  write
           <b>-Xlinker</b>  <b>-assert</b>  <b>-Xlinker</b>  <b>definitions</b>.   It does not work to write <b>-Xlinker</b> <b>"-assert</b> <b>definitions"</b>,
           because this passes the entire string as a single argument, which is not what the linker expects.

           When using the GNU linker, it is usually more convenient to pass arguments to  linker  options  using
           the  <u>option</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>  syntax  than  as  separate  arguments.   For  example,  you  can  specify <b>-Xlinker</b>
           <b>-Map=output.map</b> rather than <b>-Xlinker</b> <b>-Map</b> <b>-Xlinker</b> <b>output.map</b>.  Other linkers may  not  support  this
           syntax for command-line options.

       <b>-Wl,</b><u>option</u>
           Pass <u>option</u> as an option to the linker.  If <u>option</u> contains commas, it is split into multiple options
           at  the  commas.   You  can  use  this  syntax  to  pass  an  argument  to  the option.  For example,
           <b>-Wl,-Map,output.map</b> passes <b>-Map</b> <b>output.map</b> to the linker.  When using the GNU linker,  you  can  also
           get the same effect with <b>-Wl,-Map=output.map</b>.

           NOTE:  In  Ubuntu 8.10 and later versions, for LDFLAGS, the option <b>-Wl,-z,relro</b> is used.  To disable,
           use <b>-Wl,-z,norelro</b>.

       <b>-u</b> <u>symbol</u>
           Pretend the symbol <u>symbol</u> is undefined, to force linking of library modules to define  it.   You  can
           use <b>-u</b> multiple times with different symbols to force loading of additional library modules.

       <b>-z</b> <u>keyword</u>
           <b>-z</b>  is  passed  directly  on  to  the  linker  along with the keyword <u>keyword</u>. See the section in the
           documentation of your linker for permitted values and their meanings.

   <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Search</b>
       These options specify directories to search for  header  files,  for  libraries  and  for  parts  of  the
       compiler:

       <b>-I</b> <u>dir</u>
       <b>-iquote</b> <u>dir</u>
       <b>-isystem</b> <u>dir</u>
       <b>-idirafter</b> <u>dir</u>
           Add  the  directory  <u>dir</u>  to  the  list  of  directories  to  be  searched  for  header  files during
           preprocessing.  If <u>dir</u> begins with <b>=</b> or $SYSROOT, then the <b>=</b> or $SYSROOT is replaced by  the  sysroot
           prefix; see <b>--sysroot</b> and <b>-isysroot</b>.

           Directories  specified with <b>-iquote</b> apply only to the quote form of the directive, "#include "<u>file</u>"".
           Directories specified with <b>-I</b>, <b>-isystem</b>, or <b>-idirafter</b> apply to lookup for both the "#include "<u>file</u>""
           and "#include &lt;<u>file</u>&gt;" directives.

           You can specify any number or combination of these options on the command line to search  for  header
           files in several directories.  The lookup order is as follows:

           1.  For the quote form of the include directive, the directory of the current file is searched first.

           2.  For  the  quote  form  of the include directive, the directories specified by <b>-iquote</b> options are
               searched in left-to-right order, as they appear on the command line.

           3.  Directories specified with <b>-I</b> options are scanned in left-to-right order.

           4.  Directories specified with <b>-isystem</b> options are scanned in left-to-right order.

           5.  Standard system directories are scanned.

           6.  Directories specified with <b>-idirafter</b> options are scanned in left-to-right order.

           You can use <b>-I</b> to override  a  system  header  file,  substituting  your  own  version,  since  these
           directories are searched before the standard system header file directories.  However, you should not
           use this option to add directories that contain vendor-supplied system header files; use <b>-isystem</b> for
           that.

           The  <b>-isystem</b>  and  <b>-idirafter</b> options also mark the directory as a system directory, so that it gets
           the same special treatment that is applied to the standard system directories.

           If a standard system include directory, or a directory specified with  <b>-isystem</b>,  is  also  specified
           with  <b>-I</b>, the <b>-I</b> option is ignored.  The directory is still searched but as a system directory at its
           normal position in the system include chain.  This is to ensure that GCC's  procedure  to  fix  buggy
           system  headers and the ordering for the "#include_next" directive are not inadvertently changed.  If
           you really need to change the search order for system directories, use the <b>-nostdinc</b> and/or  <b>-isystem</b>
           options.

       <b>-I-</b> Split  the  include  path.   This  option  has  been  deprecated.   Please use <b>-iquote</b> instead for <b>-I</b>
           directories before the <b>-I-</b> and remove the <b>-I-</b> option.

           Any directories specified with <b>-I</b> options before <b>-I-</b> are searched only  for  headers  requested  with
           "#include "<u>file</u>"";  they  are  not  searched  for  "#include &lt;<u>file</u>&gt;".   If additional directories are
           specified with <b>-I</b> options after the <b>-I-</b>, those directories are searched for all <b>#include</b> directives.

           In addition, <b>-I-</b> inhibits the use of the directory of the current file directory as the first  search
           directory for "#include "<u>file</u>"".  There is no way to override this effect of <b>-I-</b>.

       <b>-iprefix</b> <u>prefix</u>
           Specify  <u>prefix</u>  as  the  prefix  for  subsequent  <b>-iwithprefix</b>  options.  If the prefix represents a
           directory, you should include the final <b>/</b>.

       <b>-iwithprefix</b> <u>dir</u>
       <b>-iwithprefixbefore</b> <u>dir</u>
           Append <u>dir</u> to the prefix specified previously with <b>-iprefix</b>, and add the resulting directory  to  the
           include  search  path.   <b>-iwithprefixbefore</b>  puts it in the same place <b>-I</b> would; <b>-iwithprefix</b> puts it
           where <b>-idirafter</b> would.

       <b>-isysroot</b> <u>dir</u>
           This option is like the <b>--sysroot</b> option, but  applies  only  to  header  files  (except  for  Darwin
           targets,  where  it  applies  to both header files and libraries).  See the <b>--sysroot</b> option for more
           information.

       <b>-imultilib</b> <u>dir</u>
           Use <u>dir</u> as a subdirectory of the directory containing target-specific C++ headers.

       <b>-nostdinc</b>
           Do not search the standard system directories for header  files.   Only  the  directories  explicitly
           specified  with  <b>-I</b>,  <b>-iquote</b>,  <b>-isystem</b>, and/or <b>-idirafter</b> options (and the directory of the current
           file, if appropriate) are searched.

       <b>-nostdinc++</b>
           Do not search for header files in the C++-specific standard directories,  but  do  still  search  the
           other standard directories.  (This option is used when building the C++ library.)

       <b>-iplugindir=</b><u>dir</u>
           Set   the   directory   to   search   for  plugins  that  are  passed  by  <b>-fplugin=</b><u>name</u>  instead  of
           <b>-fplugin=</b><u>path</u><b>/</b><u>name</u><b>.so</b>.  This option is not meant to be used by the  user,  but  only  passed  by  the
           driver.

       <b>-L</b><u>dir</u>
           Add directory <u>dir</u> to the list of directories to be searched for <b>-l</b>.

       <b>-B</b><u>prefix</u>
           This  option specifies where to find the executables, libraries, include files, and data files of the
           compiler itself.

           The compiler driver program runs one or more of the subprograms <b>cpp</b>, <b>cc1</b>, <b>as</b> and <b>ld</b>.  It tries <u>prefix</u>
           as a prefix for each program it tries  to  run,  both  with  and  without  <u>machine</u><b>/</b><u>version</u><b>/</b>  for  the
           corresponding target machine and compiler version.

           For  each  subprogram to be run, the compiler driver first tries the <b>-B</b> prefix, if any.  If that name
           is not found, or if <b>-B</b> is not specified, the driver tries two standard  prefixes,  <u>/usr/lib/gcc/</u>  and
           <u>/usr/local/lib/gcc/</u>.   If  neither  of  those  results  in  a file name that is found, the unmodified
           program name is searched for using the directories specified in your <b>PATH</b> environment variable.

           The compiler checks to see if the path provided by <b>-B</b> refers to a directory, and if necessary it adds
           a directory separator character at the end of the path.

           <b>-B</b> prefixes that effectively specify directory names also apply to libraries in the  linker,  because
           the  compiler  translates  these  options into <b>-L</b> options for the linker.  They also apply to include
           files in the preprocessor, because the compiler translates these options into  <b>-isystem</b>  options  for
           the preprocessor.  In this case, the compiler appends <b>include</b> to the prefix.

           The  runtime support file <u>libgcc.a</u> can also be searched for using the <b>-B</b> prefix, if needed.  If it is
           not found there, the two standard prefixes above are tried, and that is all.  The file is left out of
           the link if it is not found by those means.

           Another way to specify a prefix  much  like  the  <b>-B</b>  prefix  is  to  use  the  environment  variable
           <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b>.

           As  a special kludge, if the path provided by <b>-B</b> is <u>[dir/]stageN/</u>, where <u>N</u> is a number in the range 0
           to 9, then it is replaced by <u>[dir/]include</u>.  This is to help with boot-strapping the compiler.

       <b>-no-canonical-prefixes</b>
           Do not expand any symbolic links, resolve references to <b><a href="file:/../">/../</a></b> or <b><a href="file:/./">/./</a></b>, or make the path  absolute  when
           generating a relative prefix.

       <b>--sysroot=</b><u>dir</u>
           Use  <u>dir</u>  as  the  logical  root  directory  for headers and libraries.  For example, if the compiler
           normally searches for headers  in  <u><a href="file:/usr/include">/usr/include</a></u>  and  libraries  in  <u><a href="file:/usr/lib">/usr/lib</a></u>,  it  instead  searches
           <u>dir/usr/include</u> and <u>dir/usr/lib</u>.

           If you use both this option and the <b>-isysroot</b> option, then the <b>--sysroot</b> option applies to libraries,
           but the <b>-isysroot</b> option applies to header files.

           The  GNU  linker  (beginning  with  version 2.16) has the necessary support for this option.  If your
           linker does not support this option, the header file aspect of <b>--sysroot</b> still works, but the library
           aspect does not.

       <b>--no-sysroot-suffix</b>
           For some targets, a suffix is added to the root directory specified with <b>--sysroot</b>, depending on  the
           other  options  used,  so  that headers may for example be found in <u>dir/suffix/usr/include</u> instead of
           <u>dir/usr/include</u>.  This option disables the addition of such a suffix.

   <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>Code</b> <b>Generation</b> <b>Conventions</b>
       These machine-independent options control the interface conventions used in code generation.

       Most of them have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of <b>-ffoo</b> is <b>-fno-foo</b>.  In the table
       below, only one of the forms is listed---the one that is not the default.  You can figure out  the  other
       form by either removing <b>no-</b> or adding it.

       <b>-fstack-reuse=</b><u>reuse-level</u>
           This  option controls stack space reuse for user declared local/auto variables and compiler generated
           temporaries.  <u>reuse_level</u> can be <b>all</b>, <b>named_vars</b>, or <b>none</b>. <b>all</b> enables  stack  reuse  for  all  local
           variables  and  temporaries,  <b>named_vars</b> enables the reuse only for user defined local variables with
           names, and <b>none</b> disables stack reuse completely. The default value is <b>all</b>. The option is needed  when
           the  program extends the lifetime of a scoped local variable or a compiler generated temporary beyond
           the end point defined by the language.  When a lifetime of a variable ends, and if the variable lives
           in memory, the optimizing compiler has the freedom to reuse its stack space with other temporaries or
           scoped local variables whose live range does  not  overlap  with  it.  Legacy  code  extending  local
           lifetime is likely to break with the stack reuse optimization.

           For example,

                      int *p;
                      {
                        int local1;

                        p = &amp;local1;
                        local1 = 10;
                        ....
                      }
                      {
                         int local2;
                         local2 = 20;
                         ...
                      }

                      if (*p == 10)  // out of scope use of local1
                        {

                        }

           Another example:

                      struct A
                      {
                          A(int k) : i(k), j(k) { }
                          int i;
                          int j;
                      };

                      A *ap;

                      void foo(const A&amp; ar)
                      {
                         ap = &amp;ar;
                      }

                      void bar()
                      {
                         foo(<a href="../man10/A.10.html">A</a>(10)); // temp object's lifetime ends when foo returns

                         {
                           A <a href="../man20/a.20.html">a</a>(20);
                           ....
                         }
                         ap-&gt;i+= 10;  // ap references out of scope temp whose space
                                      // is reused with a. What is the value of ap-&gt;i?
                      }

           The  lifetime  of a compiler generated temporary is well defined by the C++ standard. When a lifetime
           of a temporary ends, and if the temporary lives in memory, the optimizing compiler has the freedom to
           reuse its stack space with other temporaries or scoped local variables  whose  live  range  does  not
           overlap  with  it. However some of the legacy code relies on the behavior of older compilers in which
           temporaries' stack space is not reused, the aggressive stack reuse can lead to runtime  errors.  This
           option is used to control the temporary stack reuse optimization.

       <b>-ftrapv</b>
           This  option generates traps for signed overflow on addition, subtraction, multiplication operations.
           The options <b>-ftrapv</b> and <b>-fwrapv</b> override each other, so using <b>-ftrapv</b>  <b>-fwrapv</b>  on  the  command-line
           results in <b>-fwrapv</b> being effective.  Note that only active options override, so using <b>-ftrapv</b> <b>-fwrapv</b>
           <b>-fno-wrapv</b> on the command-line results in <b>-ftrapv</b> being effective.

       <b>-fwrapv</b>
           This option instructs the compiler to assume that signed arithmetic overflow of addition, subtraction
           and  multiplication  wraps  around  using  twos-complement  representation.   This  flag enables some
           optimizations and disables others.  The options <b>-ftrapv</b> and <b>-fwrapv</b> override  each  other,  so  using
           <b>-ftrapv</b>  <b>-fwrapv</b>  on  the  command-line  results  in  <b>-fwrapv</b> being effective.  Note that only active
           options override, so using <b>-ftrapv</b> <b>-fwrapv</b> <b>-fno-wrapv</b> on the command-line results  in  <b>-ftrapv</b>  being
           effective.

       <b>-fwrapv-pointer</b>
           This  option  instructs  the  compiler  to  assume  that  pointer arithmetic overflow on addition and
           subtraction wraps around using twos-complement representation.  This flag disables some optimizations
           which assume pointer overflow is invalid.

       <b>-fstrict-overflow</b>
           This option implies <b>-fno-wrapv</b> <b>-fno-wrapv-pointer</b> and when negated implies <b>-fwrapv</b> <b>-fwrapv-pointer</b>.

       <b>-fexceptions</b>
           Enable exception handling.  Generates extra code needed to propagate exceptions.  For  some  targets,
           this  implies GCC generates frame unwind information for all functions, which can produce significant
           data size overhead, although it does not affect execution.  If you do not specify  this  option,  GCC
           enables  it  by default for languages like C++ that normally require exception handling, and disables
           it for languages like C that do not normally require it.  However, you may need to enable this option
           when compiling C code that needs to interoperate properly with exception  handlers  written  in  C++.
           You  may  also  wish  to  disable  this option if you are compiling older C++ programs that don't use
           exception handling.

       <b>-fnon-call-exceptions</b>
           Generate code that allows trapping  instructions  to  throw  exceptions.   Note  that  this  requires
           platform-specific  runtime support that does not exist everywhere.  Moreover, it only allows <u>trapping</u>
           instructions to throw exceptions, i.e. memory references or floating-point instructions.  It does not
           allow exceptions to be thrown from arbitrary signal handlers such as "SIGALRM".

       <b>-fdelete-dead-exceptions</b>
           Consider that instructions that may throw exceptions but don't otherwise contribute to the  execution
           of  the  program  can  be optimized away.  This option is enabled by default for the Ada compiler, as
           permitted by the Ada language specification.  Optimization passes that cause dead  exceptions  to  be
           removed are enabled independently at different optimization levels.

       <b>-funwind-tables</b>
           Similar  to  <b>-fexceptions</b>,  except that it just generates any needed static data, but does not affect
           the generated code in any other way.  You normally do not need to  enable  this  option;  instead,  a
           language processor that needs this handling enables it on your behalf.

       <b>-fasynchronous-unwind-tables</b>
           Generate  unwind  table  in DWARF format, if supported by target machine.  The table is exact at each
           instruction boundary, so it can be used  for  stack  unwinding  from  asynchronous  events  (such  as
           debugger or garbage collector).

       <b>-fno-gnu-unique</b>
           On  systems  with  recent  GNU  assembler  and  C library, the C++ compiler uses the "STB_GNU_UNIQUE"
           binding to make sure that definitions of template static data members and static local  variables  in
           inline functions are unique even in the presence of "RTLD_LOCAL"; this is necessary to avoid problems
           with  a  library  used by two different "RTLD_LOCAL" plugins depending on a definition in one of them
           and therefore disagreeing with the other one about the  binding  of  the  symbol.   But  this  causes
           "dlclose"  to  be  ignored for affected DSOs; if your program relies on reinitialization of a DSO via
           "dlclose" and "dlopen", you can use <b>-fno-gnu-unique</b>.

       <b>-fpcc-struct-return</b>
           Return "short" "struct" and "union" values in memory like longer  ones,  rather  than  in  registers.
           This convention is less efficient, but it has the advantage of allowing intercallability between GCC-
           compiled files and files compiled with other compilers, particularly the Portable C Compiler (pcc).

           The precise convention for returning structures in memory depends on the target configuration macros.

           Short structures and unions are those whose size and alignment match that of some integer type.

           <b>Warning:</b>  code  compiled  with  the  <b>-fpcc-struct-return</b>  switch  is  not binary compatible with code
           compiled with the <b>-freg-struct-return</b> switch.  Use it to conform to a non-default application  binary
           interface.

       <b>-freg-struct-return</b>
           Return  "struct"  and  "union"  values  in registers when possible.  This is more efficient for small
           structures than <b>-fpcc-struct-return</b>.

           If you specify  neither  <b>-fpcc-struct-return</b>  nor  <b>-freg-struct-return</b>,  GCC  defaults  to  whichever
           convention  is  standard  for  the  target.   If  there  is  no  standard convention, GCC defaults to
           <b>-fpcc-struct-return</b>, except on targets where GCC is the principal compiler.  In those cases,  we  can
           choose the standard, and we chose the more efficient register return alternative.

           <b>Warning:</b>  code  compiled  with  the  <b>-freg-struct-return</b>  switch  is  not binary compatible with code
           compiled with the <b>-fpcc-struct-return</b> switch.  Use it to conform to a non-default application  binary
           interface.

       <b>-fshort-enums</b>
           Allocate  to an "enum" type only as many bytes as it needs for the declared range of possible values.
           Specifically, the "enum" type is equivalent to the smallest integer type that has enough room.

           <b>Warning:</b> the <b>-fshort-enums</b> switch causes GCC to generate code that is not binary compatible with code
           generated without that switch.  Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.

       <b>-fshort-wchar</b>
           Override the underlying type for "wchar_t" to be "short unsigned int" instead of the default for  the
           target.  This option is useful for building programs to run under WINE.

           <b>Warning:</b> the <b>-fshort-wchar</b> switch causes GCC to generate code that is not binary compatible with code
           generated without that switch.  Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.

       <b>-fcommon</b>
           In  C  code,  this  option controls the placement of global variables defined without an initializer,
           known as  <u>tentative</u>  <u>definitions</u>  in  the  C  standard.   Tentative  definitions  are  distinct  from
           declarations of a variable with the "extern" keyword, which do not allocate storage.

           The  default  is <b>-fno-common</b>, which specifies that the compiler places uninitialized global variables
           in the BSS section of the object file.  This inhibits the merging of  tentative  definitions  by  the
           linker  so  you  get a multiple-definition error if the same variable is accidentally defined in more
           than one compilation unit.

           The <b>-fcommon</b> places uninitialized global variables in a common block.   This  allows  the  linker  to
           resolve  all  tentative  definitions  of the same variable in different compilation units to the same
           object, or to a non-tentative definition.  This behavior  is  inconsistent  with  C++,  and  on  many
           targets  implies a speed and code size penalty on global variable references.  It is mainly useful to
           enable legacy code to link without errors.

       <b>-fno-ident</b>
           Ignore the "#ident" directive.

       <b>-finhibit-size-directive</b>
           Don't output a ".size" assembler directive, or anything else that would cause trouble if the function
           is split in the middle, and the two halves are placed at locations far apart in memory.  This  option
           is used when compiling <u>crtstuff.c</u>; you should not need to use it for anything else.

       <b>-fverbose-asm</b>
           Put  extra  commentary  information  in  the  generated assembly code to make it more readable.  This
           option is generally only of use to those who actually  need  to  read  the  generated  assembly  code
           (perhaps while debugging the compiler itself).

           <b>-fno-verbose-asm</b>,  the  default,  causes  the  extra  information  to  be  omitted and is useful when
           comparing two assembler files.

           The added comments include:

           *   information on the compiler version and command-line options,

           *   the  source   code   lines   associated   with   the   assembly   instructions,   in   the   form
               FILENAME:LINENUMBER:CONTENT OF LINE,

           *   hints on which high-level expressions correspond to the various assembly instruction operands.

           For example, given this C source file:

                   int test (int n)
                   {
                     int i;
                     int total = 0;

                     for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
                       total += i * i;

                     return total;
                   }

           compiling to (x86_64) assembly via <b>-S</b> and emitting the result direct to stdout via <b>-o</b> <b>-</b>

                   gcc -S test.c -fverbose-asm -Os -o -

           gives output similar to this:

           The  comments  are  intended  for  humans  rather  than  machines and hence the precise format of the
           comments is subject to change.

       <b>-frecord-gcc-switches</b>
           This switch causes the command line used to invoke the compiler to be recorded into the  object  file
           that  is  being created.  This switch is only implemented on some targets and the exact format of the
           recording is target and binary file format dependent, but it usually takes  the  form  of  a  section
           containing  ASCII  text.   This  switch  is related to the <b>-fverbose-asm</b> switch, but that switch only
           records information in the assembler output file as comments, so it never reaches  the  object  file.
           See also <b>-grecord-gcc-switches</b> for another way of storing compiler options into the object file.

       <b>-fpic</b>
           Generate  position-independent  code (PIC) suitable for use in a shared library, if supported for the
           target machine.  Such code accesses all constant addresses through a global offset table (GOT).   The
           dynamic  loader  resolves  the GOT entries when the program starts (the dynamic loader is not part of
           GCC; it is part of the operating system).  If the GOT  size  for  the  linked  executable  exceeds  a
           machine-specific  maximum  size,  you get an error message from the linker indicating that <b>-fpic</b> does
           not work; in that case, recompile with <b>-fPIC</b> instead.  (These maximums are 8k on the  SPARC,  28k  on
           AArch64 and 32k on the m68k and RS/6000.  The x86 has no such limit.)

           Position-independent  code  requires  special  support, and therefore works only on certain machines.
           For the x86, GCC supports PIC for System V but not for the Sun 386i.   Code  generated  for  the  IBM
           RS/6000 is always position-independent.

           When this flag is set, the macros "__pic__" and "__PIC__" are defined to 1.

       <b>-fPIC</b>
           If supported for the target machine, emit position-independent code, suitable for dynamic linking and
           avoiding  any  limit  on  the  size  of  the  global offset table.  This option makes a difference on
           AArch64, m68k, PowerPC and SPARC.

           Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works only on certain machines.

           When this flag is set, the macros "__pic__" and "__PIC__" are defined to 2.

       <b>-fpie</b>
       <b>-fPIE</b>
           These options are similar to <b>-fpic</b> and <b>-fPIC</b>, but the generated position-independent code can be only
           linked into executables.  Usually these options are used to compile code that will  be  linked  using
           the <b>-pie</b> GCC option.

           <b>-fpie</b>  and  <b>-fPIE</b>  both  define  the macros "__pie__" and "__PIE__".  The macros have the value 1 for
           <b>-fpie</b> and 2 for <b>-fPIE</b>.

       <b>-fno-plt</b>
           Do not use the PLT for external function calls  in  position-independent  code.   Instead,  load  the
           callee  address  at  call  sites from the GOT and branch to it.  This leads to more efficient code by
           eliminating PLT stubs and exposing GOT loads to optimizations.  On architectures such as  32-bit  x86
           where  PLT  stubs  expect the GOT pointer in a specific register, this gives more register allocation
           freedom to the compiler.  Lazy binding requires use of the PLT; with <b>-fno-plt</b>  all  external  symbols
           are resolved at load time.

           Alternatively, the function attribute "noplt" can be used to avoid calls through the PLT for specific
           external functions.

           In  position-dependent code, a few targets also convert calls to functions that are marked to not use
           the PLT to use the GOT instead.

       <b>-fno-jump-tables</b>
           Do not use jump tables for switch statements even where it would be more efficient  than  other  code
           generation  strategies.   This  option is of use in conjunction with <b>-fpic</b> or <b>-fPIC</b> for building code
           that forms part of a dynamic linker and cannot reference the  address  of  a  jump  table.   On  some
           targets, jump tables do not require a GOT and this option is not needed.

       <b>-fno-bit-tests</b>
           Do  not  use  bit  tests  for switch statements even where it would be more efficient than other code
           generation strategies.

       <b>-ffixed-</b><u>reg</u>
           Treat the register named <u>reg</u> as a fixed register; generated code should never  refer  to  it  (except
           perhaps as a stack pointer, frame pointer or in some other fixed role).

           <u>reg</u> must be the name of a register.  The register names accepted are machine-specific and are defined
           in the "REGISTER_NAMES" macro in the machine description macro file.

           This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a three-way choice.

       <b>-fcall-used-</b><u>reg</u>
           Treat the register named <u>reg</u> as an allocable register that is clobbered by function calls.  It may be
           allocated  for  temporaries or variables that do not live across a call.  Functions compiled this way
           do not save and restore the register <u>reg</u>.

           It is an error to use this flag with the frame pointer or stack pointer.  Use of this flag for  other
           registers  that  have  fixed  pervasive  roles  in  the machine's execution model produces disastrous
           results.

           This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a three-way choice.

       <b>-fcall-saved-</b><u>reg</u>
           Treat the register named <u>reg</u> as an allocable register saved by functions.  It may be  allocated  even
           for  temporaries  or variables that live across a call.  Functions compiled this way save and restore
           the register <u>reg</u> if they use it.

           It is an error to use this flag with the frame pointer or stack pointer.  Use of this flag for  other
           registers  that  have  fixed  pervasive  roles  in  the machine's execution model produces disastrous
           results.

           A different sort of disaster results from the use of this flag  for  a  register  in  which  function
           values may be returned.

           This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a three-way choice.

       <b>-fpack-struct[=</b><u>n</u><b>]</b>
           Without  a  value  specified,  pack  all  structure  members together without holes.  When a value is
           specified (which must be a small power of two), pack  structure  members  according  to  this  value,
           representing  the maximum alignment (that is, objects with default alignment requirements larger than
           this are output potentially unaligned at the next fitting location.

           <b>Warning:</b> the <b>-fpack-struct</b> switch causes GCC to generate code that is not binary compatible with code
           generated without that switch.  Additionally, it makes the code suboptimal.  Use it to conform  to  a
           non-default application binary interface.

       <b>-fleading-underscore</b>
           This  option  and  its  counterpart,  <b>-fno-leading-underscore</b>,  forcibly change the way C symbols are
           represented in the object file.  One use is to help link with legacy assembly code.

           <b>Warning:</b> the <b>-fleading-underscore</b> switch causes GCC to generate code that is  not  binary  compatible
           with  code  generated  without  that  switch.   Use it to conform to a non-default application binary
           interface.  Not all targets provide complete support for this switch.

       <b>-ftls-model=</b><u>model</u>
           Alter the thread-local storage model to be used.  The <u>model</u> argument should be one of <b>global-dynamic</b>,
           <b>local-dynamic</b>, <b>initial-exec</b> or <b>local-exec</b>.  Note that the choice  is  subject  to  optimization:  the
           compiler  may  use a more efficient model for symbols not visible outside of the translation unit, or
           if <b>-fpic</b> is not given on the command line.

           The default without <b>-fpic</b> is <b>initial-exec</b>; with <b>-fpic</b> the default is <b>global-dynamic</b>.

       <b>-ftrampolines</b>
           For targets that normally need trampolines for nested functions,  always  generate  them  instead  of
           using descriptors.  Otherwise, for targets that do not need them, like for example HP-PA or IA-64, do
           nothing.

           A  trampoline is a small piece of code that is created at run time on the stack when the address of a
           nested function is taken, and is used to call the nested function indirectly.  Therefore, it requires
           the stack to be made executable in order for the program to work properly.

           <b>-fno-trampolines</b> is enabled by default on a language by language basis  to  let  the  compiler  avoid
           generating  them,  if  it computes that this is safe, and replace them with descriptors.  Descriptors
           are made up of data only, but the generated code must be prepared to deal  with  them.   As  of  this
           writing, <b>-fno-trampolines</b> is enabled by default only for Ada.

           Moreover,  code  compiled  with  <b>-ftrampolines</b> and code compiled with <b>-fno-trampolines</b> are not binary
           compatible if nested functions are present.  This option must therefore be  used  on  a  program-wide
           basis and be manipulated with extreme care.

       <b>-fvisibility=</b>[<b>default</b>|<b>internal</b>|<b>hidden</b>|<b>protected</b>]
           Set  the  default  ELF  image symbol visibility to the specified option---all symbols are marked with
           this unless overridden within the code.  Using this feature can very  substantially  improve  linking
           and  load  times  of  shared  object libraries, produce more optimized code, provide near-perfect API
           export and prevent symbol clashes.  It is <b>strongly</b> recommended  that  you  use  this  in  any  shared
           objects you distribute.

           Despite  the  nomenclature,  <b>default</b>  always  means public; i.e., available to be linked against from
           outside the shared object.  <b>protected</b> and <b>internal</b> are pretty useless in real-world usage so the only
           other commonly used option is <b>hidden</b>.  The default if <b>-fvisibility</b> isn't specified is <b>default</b>,  i.e.,
           make every symbol public.

           A  good  explanation  of  the benefits offered by ensuring ELF symbols have the correct visibility is
           given  by  "How  To  Write  Shared  Libraries"  by  Ulrich   Drepper   (which   can   be   found   at
           &lt;<b>https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/</b>&gt;)---however  a  superior  solution  made possible by this option to
           marking things hidden when the default is public is to  make  the  default  hidden  and  mark  things
           public.   This  is  the  norm  with  DLLs  on Windows and with <b>-fvisibility=hidden</b> and "__attribute__
           ((visibility("default")))" instead of "__declspec(dllexport)" you get almost identical semantics with
           identical syntax.  This is a great boon to those working with cross-platform projects.

           For those adding visibility support to existing code, you may find "#pragma GCC visibility"  of  use.
           This  works  by  you  enclosing  the  declarations  you wish to set visibility for with (for example)
           "#pragma GCC visibility push(hidden)" and "#pragma GCC visibility pop".  Bear  in  mind  that  symbol
           visibility should be viewed <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>API</b> <b>interface</b> <b>contract</b> and thus all new code should always
           specify  visibility  when it is not the default; i.e., declarations only for use within the local DSO
           should <b>always</b> be marked explicitly as hidden as so to avoid PLT indirection  overheads---making  this
           abundantly  clear also aids readability and self-documentation of the code.  Note that due to ISO C++
           specification  requirements,  "operator  new"  and  "operator  delete"  must  always  be  of  default
           visibility.

           Be  aware  that  headers from outside your project, in particular system headers and headers from any
           other library you use, may not be expecting to be compiled with visibility other  than  the  default.
           You  may  need  to  explicitly  say  "#pragma GCC visibility push(default)" before including any such
           headers.

           "extern" declarations are not affected by <b>-fvisibility</b>, so a lot  of  code  can  be  recompiled  with
           <b>-fvisibility=hidden</b> with no modifications.  However, this means that calls to "extern" functions with
           no  explicit  visibility  use  the  PLT,  so it is more effective to use "__attribute ((visibility))"
           and/or "#pragma GCC visibility" to tell the compiler which "extern" declarations should be treated as
           hidden.

           Note that <b>-fvisibility</b> does affect C++ vague linkage entities. This  means  that,  for  instance,  an
           exception  class  that is be thrown between DSOs must be explicitly marked with default visibility so
           that the <b>type_info</b> nodes are unified between the DSOs.

           An   overview   of   these   techniques,   their   benefits   and   how   to   use   them    is    at
           &lt;<b><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility">http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility</a></b>&gt;.

       <b>-fstrict-volatile-bitfields</b>
           This  option  should  be used if accesses to volatile bit-fields (or other structure fields, although
           the compiler usually honors those types anyway) should use a  single  access  of  the  width  of  the
           field's  type,  aligned  to a natural alignment if possible.  For example, targets with memory-mapped
           peripheral registers might require all such accesses to be 16 bits  wide;  with  this  flag  you  can
           declare all peripheral bit-fields as "unsigned short" (assuming short is 16 bits on these targets) to
           force GCC to use 16-bit accesses instead of, perhaps, a more efficient 32-bit access.

           If  this  option  is  disabled,  the  compiler  uses the most efficient instruction.  In the previous
           example, that might be a 32-bit load instruction, even though that accesses bytes that do not contain
           any portion of the bit-field, or memory-mapped registers unrelated to the one being updated.

           In some cases, such as when the "packed" attribute is applied to a structure field,  it  may  not  be
           possible  to  access  the  field with a single read or write that is correctly aligned for the target
           machine.  In this case GCC falls back to generating multiple accesses  rather  than  code  that  will
           fault or truncate the result at run time.

           Note:   Due  to restrictions of the C/C++11 memory model, write accesses are not allowed to touch non
           bit-field members.  It is therefore recommended to define all bits of the field's type  as  bit-field
           members.

           The  default  value  of  this option is determined by the application binary interface for the target
           processor.

       <b>-fsync-libcalls</b>
           This option controls whether any out-of-line instance of the "__sync" family of functions may be used
           to implement the C++11 "__atomic" family of functions.

           The default value  of  this  option  is  enabled,  thus  the  only  useful  form  of  the  option  is
           <b>-fno-sync-libcalls</b>.  This option is used in the implementation of the <u>libatomic</u> runtime library.

   <b>GCC</b> <b>Developer</b> <b>Options</b>
       This  section  describes command-line options that are primarily of interest to GCC developers, including
       options to support compiler testing and investigation  of  compiler  bugs  and  compile-time  performance
       problems.   This  includes  options  that  produce debug dumps at various points in the compilation; that
       print statistics such as  memory  use  and  execution  time;  and  that  print  information  about  GCC's
       configuration,  such  as  where  it  searches  for libraries.  You should rarely need to use any of these
       options for ordinary compilation and linking tasks.

       Many developer options that cause GCC to dump output to a file take an optional <b>=</b><u>filename</u> suffix. You can
       specify <b>stdout</b> or <b>-</b> to dump to standard output, and <b>stderr</b> for standard error.

       If <b>=</b><u>filename</u> is omitted, a default dump file name is constructed by  concatenating  the  base  dump  file
       name,  a  pass  number,  phase letter, and pass name.  The base dump file name is the name of output file
       produced by the compiler if explicitly specified and not an executable; otherwise it is the  source  file
       name.  The pass number is determined by the order passes are registered with the compiler's pass manager.
       This  is  generally the same as the order of execution, but passes registered by plugins, target-specific
       passes, or passes that are otherwise registered late are numbered higher than the pass named <b>final</b>,  even
       if  they  are  executed  earlier.  The phase letter is one of <b>i</b> (inter-procedural analysis), <b>l</b> (language-
       specific), <b>r</b> (RTL), or <b>t</b> (tree).  The files are created in the directory of the output file.

       <b>-fcallgraph-info</b>
       <b>-fcallgraph-info=</b><u>MARKERS</u>
           Makes the compiler output callgraph information for the program, on  a  per-object-file  basis.   The
           information  is  generated  in  the common VCG format.  It can be decorated with additional, per-node
           and/or per-edge information, if a list of comma-separated markers is  additionally  specified.   When
           the  "su"  marker  is  specified,  the  callgraph  is  decorated  with stack usage information; it is
           equivalent to <b>-fstack-usage</b>.  When the "da" marker is specified,  the  callgraph  is  decorated  with
           information about dynamically allocated objects.

           When  compiling  with  <b>-flto</b>,  no callgraph information is output along with the object file.  At LTO
           link time, <b>-fcallgraph-info</b> may generate multiple callgraph information files  next  to  intermediate
           LTO output files.

       <b>-d</b><u>letters</u>
       <b>-fdump-rtl-</b><u>pass</u>
       <b>-fdump-rtl-</b><u>pass</u><b>=</b><u>filename</u>
           Says  to  make  debugging  dumps  during compilation at times specified by <u>letters</u>.  This is used for
           debugging the RTL-based passes of the compiler.

           Some <b>-d</b><u>letters</u> switches have different meaning when <b>-E</b> is used for preprocessing.

           Debug dumps can be enabled with a <b>-fdump-rtl</b> switch or some <b>-d</b> option <u>letters</u>.  Here are the possible

               The length and cost of each instruction are also printed.

           <b>-dP</b> Dump  the  RTL  in  the assembler output as a comment before each instruction.  Also turns on <b>-dp</b>
               annotation.

           Dump debugging information generated during the early debug generation phase.

       <b>-fdump-noaddr</b>

       <b>-freport-bug</b>
           Collect and dump debug information into a temporary file if an internal compiler error (ICE) occurs.

       <b>-fdump-unnumbered</b>
           When  doing  debugging  dumps,  suppress  instruction numbers and address output.  This makes it more
           feasible to use diff  on  debugging  dumps  for  compiler  invocations  with  different  options,  in
           particular with and without <b>-g</b>.

       <b>-fdump-unnumbered-links</b>
           When  doing  debugging dumps (see <b>-d</b> option above), suppress instruction numbers for the links to the

       <b>-fdump-ipa-</b><u>switch</u>
       <b>-fdump-ipa-</b><u>switch</u><b>-</b><u>options</u>
           Control the dumping at various stages of inter-procedural analysis language tree to a file.  The file
           name is generated by appending a switch specific suffix to the source file  name,  and  the  file  is
           created in the same directory as the output file.  The following dumps are possible:

           <b>all</b> Enables all inter-procedural analysis dumps.

           <b>cgraph</b>
               Dumps information about call-graph optimization, unused function removal, and inlining decisions.

           <b>inline</b>
               Dump after function inlining.

           Additionally, the options <b>-optimized</b>, <b>-missed</b>, <b>-note</b>, and <b>-all</b> can be provided, with the same meaning
           as for <b>-fopt-info</b>, defaulting to <b>-optimized</b>.

           For example, <b>-fdump-ipa-inline-optimized-missed</b> will emit information on callsites that were inlined,
           along with callsites that were not inlined.

           By  default, the dump will contain messages about successful optimizations (equivalent to <b>-optimized</b>)
           together with low-level details about the analysis.

       <b>-fdump-lang</b>
           Dump language-specific information.  The file name is made by appending  <u>.lang</u>  to  the  source  file
           name.

       <b>-fdump-lang-all</b>
       <b>-fdump-lang-</b><u>switch</u>
       <b>-fdump-lang-</b><u>switch</u><b>-</b><u>options</u>
       <b>-fdump-lang-</b><u>switch</u><b>-</b><u>options</u><b>=</b><u>filename</u>
           Control  the  dumping  of language-specific information.  The <u>options</u> and <u>filename</u> portions behave as
           described in the <b>-fdump-tree</b> option.  The following <u>switch</u> values are accepted:

           <b>all</b> Enable all language-specific dumps.

           <b>class</b>
               Dump class hierarchy  information.   Virtual  table  information  is  emitted  unless  '<b>slim</b>'  is
               specified.  This option is applicable to C++ only.

           <b>module</b>
               Dump  module  information.   Options <b>lineno</b> (locations), <b>graph</b> (reachability), <b>blocks</b> (clusters),
               <b>uid</b> (serialization), <b>alias</b> (mergeable), <b>asmname</b> (Elrond), <b>eh</b> (mapper) &amp; <b>vops</b> (macros) may provide
               additional information.  This option is applicable to C++ only.

           <b>raw</b> Dump the raw internal tree data.  This option is applicable to C++ only.

       <b>-fdump-passes</b>
           Print on <u>stderr</u> the list of optimization passes that are turned on and off by  the  current  command-
           line options.

       <b>-fdump-statistics-</b><u>option</u>
           Enable  and  control  dumping  of  pass statistics in a separate file.  The file name is generated by
           appending a suffix ending in <b>.statistics</b> to the source file name, and the file is created in the same
           directory as the output file.  If the <b>-</b><u>option</u> form is used, <b>-stats</b> causes counters to be summed  over
           the whole compilation unit while <b>-details</b> dumps every event as the passes generate them.  The default
           with no option is to sum counters for each function compiled.

       <b>-fdump-tree-all</b>
       <b>-fdump-tree-</b><u>switch</u>
       <b>-fdump-tree-</b><u>switch</u><b>-</b><u>options</u>
       <b>-fdump-tree-</b><u>switch</u><b>-</b><u>options</u><b>=</b><u>filename</u>
           Control the dumping at various stages of processing the intermediate language tree to a file.  If the
           <b>-</b><u>options</u>  form  is  used,  <u>options</u>  is a list of <b>-</b> separated options which control the details of the
           dump.  Not all options are applicable to all dumps; those that are not meaningful are  ignored.   The
           following options are available

           <b>address</b>
               Print  the  address  of each node.  Usually this is not meaningful as it changes according to the
               environment and source file.  Its primary  use  is  for  tying  up  a  dump  file  with  a  debug
               environment.

           <b>asmname</b>
               If  "DECL_ASSEMBLER_NAME"  has  been  set  for  a  given  decl,  use  that in the dump instead of
               "DECL_NAME".  Its primary use is ease of use working backward from mangled names in the  assembly
               file.

           <b>slim</b>
               When  dumping  front-end  intermediate  representations, inhibit dumping of members of a scope or
               body of a function merely because that scope has been reached.  Only dump such  items  when  they
               are directly reachable by some other path.

               When dumping pretty-printed trees, this option inhibits dumping the bodies of control structures.

               When  dumping  RTL,  print  the  RTL  in  slim  (condensed) form instead of the default LISP-like
               representation.

           <b>raw</b> Print a raw representation of the tree.  By default,  trees  are  pretty-printed  into  a  C-like
               representation.

           <b>details</b>
               Enable  more detailed dumps (not honored by every dump option). Also include information from the
               optimization passes.

           <b>stats</b>
               Enable dumping various statistics about the pass (not honored by every dump option).

           <b>blocks</b>
               Enable showing basic block boundaries (disabled in raw dumps).

           <b>graph</b>
               For each of the other indicated dump  files  (<b>-fdump-rtl-</b><u>pass</u>),  dump  a  representation  of  the
               control  flow graph suitable for viewing with GraphViz to <u>file.passid.pass.dot</u>.  Each function in
               the file is pretty-printed as a subgraph, so that GraphViz can render them all in a single plot.

               This option currently only works for RTL dumps, and the RTL is always dumped in slim form.

           <b>vops</b>
               Enable showing virtual operands for every statement.

           <b>lineno</b>
               Enable showing line numbers for statements.

           <b>uid</b> Enable showing the unique ID ("DECL_UID") for each variable.

           <b>verbose</b>
               Enable showing the tree dump for each statement.

           <b>eh</b>  Enable showing the EH region number holding each statement.

           <b>scev</b>
               Enable showing scalar evolution analysis details.

           <b>optimized</b>
               Enable showing optimization information (only available in certain passes).

           <b>missed</b>
               Enable showing missed optimization information (only available in certain passes).

           <b>note</b>
               Enable other detailed optimization information (only available in certain passes).

           <b>all</b> Turn on all options, except <b>raw</b>, <b>slim</b>, <b>verbose</b> and <b>lineno</b>.

           <b>optall</b>
               Turn on all optimization options, i.e., <b>optimized</b>, <b>missed</b>, and <b>note</b>.

           To determine what tree dumps are available or find the dump for a pass of interest follow  the  steps
           below.

           1.  Invoke  GCC  with  <b>-fdump-passes</b> and in the <u>stderr</u> output look for a code that corresponds to the
               pass you are interested in.  For example, the codes  "tree-evrp",  "tree-vrp1",  and  "tree-vrp2"
               correspond  to  the  three  Value  Range Propagation passes.  The number at the end distinguishes
               distinct invocations of the same pass.

           2.  To enable the creation of the dump file, append the pass code to the <b>-fdump-</b>  option  prefix  and
               invoke GCC with it.  For example, to enable the dump from the Early Value Range Propagation pass,
               invoke  GCC  with  the <b>-fdump-tree-evrp</b> option.  Optionally, you may specify the name of the dump
               file.  If you don't specify one, GCC creates as described below.

           3.  Find the pass dump in a file whose name is composed of three components separated  by  a  period:
               the  name  of  the  source  file GCC was invoked to compile, a numeric suffix indicating the pass
               number followed by the letter <b>t</b> for tree passes (and the letter <b>r</b> for RTL  passes),  and  finally
               the  pass code.  For example, the Early VRP pass dump might be in a file named <u>myfile.c.038t.evrp</u>
               in the current working directory.  Note that the numeric codes are not stable and may change from
               one version of GCC to another.

       <b>-fopt-info</b>
       <b>-fopt-info-</b><u>options</u>
       <b>-fopt-info-</b><u>options</u><b>=</b><u>filename</u>
           Controls optimization dumps from various optimization passes. If the <b>-</b><u>options</u> form is  used,  <u>options</u>
           is a list of <b>-</b> separated option keywords to select the dump details and optimizations.

           The <u>options</u> can be divided into three groups:

           1.  options describing what kinds of messages should be emitted,

           2.  options describing the verbosity of the dump, and

           3.  options describing which optimizations should be included.

           The  options from each group can be freely mixed as they are non-overlapping. However, in case of any
           conflicts, the later options override the earlier options on the command line.

           The following options control which kinds of messages should be emitted:

           <b>optimized</b>
               Print information when an optimization is successfully applied. It is up  to  a  pass  to  decide
               which  information  is  relevant. For example, the vectorizer passes print the source location of
               loops which are successfully vectorized.

           <b>missed</b>
               Print information about missed optimizations. Individual  passes  control  which  information  to
               include in the output.

           <b>note</b>
               Print  verbose  information  about  optimizations, such as certain transformations, more detailed
               messages about decisions etc.

           <b>all</b> Print detailed optimization information. This includes <b>optimized</b>, <b>missed</b>, and <b>note</b>.

           The following option controls the dump verbosity:

           <b>internals</b>
               By default, only  "high-level"  messages  are  emitted.  This  option  enables  additional,  more
               detailed, messages, which are likely to only be of interest to GCC developers.

           One or more of the following option keywords can be used to describe a group of optimizations:

           <b>ipa</b> Enable dumps from all interprocedural optimizations.

           <b>loop</b>
               Enable dumps from all loop optimizations.

           <b>inline</b>
               Enable dumps from all inlining optimizations.

           <b>omp</b> Enable dumps from all OMP (Offloading and Multi Processing) optimizations.

           <b>vec</b> Enable dumps from all vectorization optimizations.

           <b>optall</b>
               Enable dumps from all optimizations. This is a superset of the optimization groups listed above.

           If <u>options</u> is omitted, it defaults to <b>optimized-optall</b>, which means to dump messages about successful
           optimizations from all the passes, omitting messages that are treated as "internals".

           If  the  <u>filename</u>  is provided, then the dumps from all the applicable optimizations are concatenated
           into the <u>filename</u>.  Otherwise the dump is output onto <u>stderr</u>. Though multiple <b>-fopt-info</b> options  are
           accepted,  only  one of them can include a <u>filename</u>. If other filenames are provided then all but the
           first such option are ignored.

           Note that the output <u>filename</u> is overwritten in case of multiple translation  units.  If  a  combined
           output from multiple translation units is desired, <u>stderr</u> should be used instead.

           In the following example, the optimization info is output to <u>stderr</u>:

                   gcc -O3 -fopt-info

           This example:

                   gcc -O3 -fopt-info-missed=missed.all

           outputs missed optimization report from all the passes into <u>missed.all</u>, and this one:

                   gcc -O2 -ftree-vectorize -fopt-info-vec-missed

           prints information about missed optimization opportunities from vectorization passes on <u>stderr</u>.  Note
           that  <b>-fopt-info-vec-missed</b>  is  equivalent  to <b>-fopt-info-missed-vec</b>.  The order of the optimization
           group names and message types listed after <b>-fopt-info</b> does not matter.

           As another example,

                   gcc -O3 -fopt-info-inline-optimized-missed=inline.txt

           outputs information about missed optimizations as well as optimized locations from all  the  inlining
           passes into <u>inline.txt</u>.

           Finally, consider:

                   gcc -fopt-info-vec-missed=vec.miss -fopt-info-loop-optimized=loop.opt

           Here  the  two  output  filenames <u>vec.miss</u> and <u>loop.opt</u> are in conflict since only one output file is
           allowed. In this case, only the first option takes effect and the  subsequent  options  are  ignored.
           Thus only <u>vec.miss</u> is produced which contains dumps from the vectorizer about missed opportunities.

       <b>-fsave-optimization-record</b>
           Write  a  SRCFILE.opt-record.json.gz  file  detailing  what  optimizations  were performed, for those
           optimizations that support <b>-fopt-info</b>.

           This option is experimental and the format of the data within the compressed JSON file is subject  to
           change.

           It is roughly equivalent to a machine-readable version of <b>-fopt-info-all</b>, as a collection of messages
           with source file, line number and column number, with the following additional data for each message:

           *   the  execution count of the code being optimized, along with metadata about whether this was from
               actual profile data, or just an estimate, allowing  consumers  to  prioritize  messages  by  code
               hotness,

           *   the function name of the code being optimized, where applicable,

           *   the  "inlining  chain"  for  the  code  being  optimized, so that when a function is inlined into
               several different places (which might themselves be inlined), the reader can distinguish  between
               the copies,

           *   objects  identifying  those parts of the message that refer to expressions, statements or symbol-
               table nodes, which of these categories they are, and, when available, their source code location,

           *   the GCC pass that emitted the message, and

           *   the location in GCC's own code from which the message was emitted

           Additionally, some messages are logically nested within  other  messages,  reflecting  implementation
           details of the optimization passes.

       <b>-fsched-verbose=</b><u>n</u>
           On  targets  that use instruction scheduling, this option controls the amount of debugging output the
           scheduler prints to the dump files.

           For <u>n</u> greater than zero, <b>-fsched-verbose</b>  outputs  the  same  information  as  <b>-fdump-rtl-sched1</b>  and
           <b>-fdump-rtl-sched2</b>.   For <u>n</u> greater than one, it also output basic block probabilities, detailed ready
           list information and unit/insn info.  For <u>n</u> greater  than  two,  it  includes  RTL  at  abort  point,
           control-flow and regions info.  And for <u>n</u> over four, <b>-fsched-verbose</b> also includes dependence info.

       <b>-fenable-</b><u>kind</u><b>-</b><u>pass</u>
       <b>-fdisable-</b><u>kind</u><b>-</b><u>pass</u><b>=</b><u>range-list</u>
           This  is  a  set  of  options  that are used to explicitly disable/enable optimization passes.  These
           options are intended for use for debugging GCC.   Compiler  users  should  use  regular  options  for
           enabling/disabling passes instead.

           <b>-fdisable-ipa-</b><u>pass</u>
               Disable  IPA  pass  <u>pass</u>.  <u>pass</u>  is the pass name.  If the same pass is statically invoked in the
               compiler multiple times, the pass name should be appended with a sequential number starting  from
               1.

           <b>-fdisable-rtl-</b><u>pass</u>
           <b>-fdisable-rtl-</b><u>pass</u><b>=</b><u>range-list</u>
               Disable  RTL  pass  <u>pass</u>.   <u>pass</u> is the pass name.  If the same pass is statically invoked in the
               compiler multiple times, the pass name should be appended with a sequential number starting  from
               1.   <u>range-list</u> is a comma-separated list of function ranges or assembler names.  Each range is a
               number pair separated by a colon.  The range is inclusive in both ends.  If the range is trivial,
               the number pair can be simplified as a single number.  If the function's call  graph  node's  <u>uid</u>
               falls  within  one  of  the specified ranges, the <u>pass</u> is disabled for that function.  The <u>uid</u> is
               shown in the function header of a dump file, and the pass names can be  dumped  by  using  option
               <b>-fdump-passes</b>.

           <b>-fdisable-tree-</b><u>pass</u>
           <b>-fdisable-tree-</b><u>pass</u><b>=</b><u>range-list</u>
               Disable tree pass <u>pass</u>.  See <b>-fdisable-rtl</b> for the description of option arguments.

           <b>-fenable-ipa-</b><u>pass</u>
               Enable  IPA  pass  <u>pass</u>.   <u>pass</u>  is the pass name.  If the same pass is statically invoked in the
               compiler multiple times, the pass name should be appended with a sequential number starting  from
               1.

           <b>-fenable-rtl-</b><u>pass</u>
           <b>-fenable-rtl-</b><u>pass</u><b>=</b><u>range-list</u>
               Enable RTL pass <u>pass</u>.  See <b>-fdisable-rtl</b> for option argument description and examples.

           <b>-fenable-tree-</b><u>pass</u>
           <b>-fenable-tree-</b><u>pass</u><b>=</b><u>range-list</u>
               Enable tree pass <u>pass</u>.  See <b>-fdisable-rtl</b> for the description of option arguments.

           Here are some examples showing uses of these options.

                   # disable ccp1 for all functions
                      -fdisable-tree-ccp1
                   # disable complete unroll for function whose cgraph node uid is 1
                      -fenable-tree-cunroll=1
                   # disable gcse2 for functions at the following ranges [1,1],
                   # [300,400], and [400,1000]
                   # disable gcse2 for functions foo and foo2
                      -fdisable-rtl-gcse2=foo,foo2
                   # disable early inlining
                      -fdisable-tree-einline
                   # disable ipa inlining
                      -fdisable-ipa-inline
                   # enable tree full unroll
                      -fenable-tree-unroll

       <b>-fchecking</b>
       <b>-fchecking=</b><u>n</u>
           Enable   internal   consistency  checking.   The  default  depends  on  the  compiler  configuration.
           <b>-fchecking=2</b> enables further internal consistency checking that might affect code generation.

       <b>-frandom-seed=</b><u>string</u>
           This option provides a seed that GCC uses in place of random numbers  in  generating  certain  symbol
           names  that  have  to be different in every compiled file.  It is also used to place unique stamps in
           coverage data files and the object files that produce them.  You can use the <b>-frandom-seed</b> option  to
           produce reproducibly identical object files.

           The  <u>string</u> can either be a number (decimal, octal or hex) or an arbitrary string (in which case it's
           converted to a number by computing CRC32).

           The <u>string</u> should be different for every file you compile.

       <b>-save-temps</b>
           Store the usual "temporary" intermediate files permanently; name them as auxiliary output  files,  as
           specified described under <b>-dumpbase</b> and <b>-dumpdir</b>.

           When  used  in  combination  with the <b>-x</b> command-line option, <b>-save-temps</b> is sensible enough to avoid
           overwriting an input source file with the same extension as an intermediate file.  The  corresponding
           intermediate file may be obtained by renaming the source file before using <b>-save-temps</b>.

       <b>-save-temps=cwd</b>
           Equivalent to <b>-save-temps</b> <b>-dumpdir</b> <b>./</b>.

       <b>-save-temps=obj</b>
           Equivalent  to  <b>-save-temps</b>  <b>-dumpdir</b>  <u><b>outdir/</b></u>,  where  <u>outdir/</u>  is  the directory of the output file
           specified after the <b>-o</b> option, including any directory separators.  If the <b>-o</b> option is not used, the
           <b>-save-temps=obj</b> switch behaves like <b>-save-temps=cwd</b>.

       <b>-time</b>[<b>=</b><u>file</u>]
           Report the CPU time taken by each subprocess in the compilation sequence.  For C source  files,  this
           is the compiler proper and assembler (plus the linker if linking is done).

           Without the specification of an output file, the output looks like this:

                   # cc1 0.12 0.01
                   # as 0.00 0.01

           The  first  number  on each line is the "user time", that is time spent executing the program itself.
           The second number is "system time", time spent executing operating system routines on behalf  of  the
           program.  Both numbers are in seconds.

           With the specification of an output file, the output is appended to the named file, and it looks like
           this:

                   0.12 0.01 cc1 &lt;options&gt;
                   0.00 0.01 as &lt;options&gt;

           The  "user  time"  and the "system time" are moved before the program name, and the options passed to
           the program are displayed, so that one can later tell what file was being compiled,  and  with  which
           options.

       <b>-fdump-final-insns</b>[<b>=</b><u>file</u>]
           Dump  the  final  internal  representation (RTL) to <u>file</u>.  If the optional argument is omitted (or if
           <u>file</u> is "."), the name of the dump file is determined by appending ".gkd" to the dump base name,  see
           <b>-dumpbase</b>.

       <b>-fcompare-debug</b>[<b>=</b><u>opts</u>]
           If   no  error  occurs  during  compilation,  run  the  compiler  a  second  time,  adding  <u>opts</u>  and
           <b>-fcompare-debug-second</b> to the arguments passed to the second compilation.  Dump  the  final  internal
           representation in both compilations, and print an error if they differ.

           If the equal sign is omitted, the default <b>-gtoggle</b> is used.

           The  environment  variable  <b>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</b>,  if defined, non-empty and nonzero, implicitly enables
           <b>-fcompare-debug</b>.  If <b>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</b> is defined to a string starting with a dash, then it  is  used
           for <u>opts</u>, otherwise the default <b>-gtoggle</b> is used.

           <b>-fcompare-debug=</b>,  with  the  equal sign but without <u>opts</u>, is equivalent to <b>-fno-compare-debug</b>, which
           disables the dumping of  the  final  representation  and  the  second  compilation,  preventing  even
           <b>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</b> from taking effect.

           To   verify   full   coverage   during   <b>-fcompare-debug</b>   testing,   set  <b>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</b>  to  say
           <b>-fcompare-debug-not-overridden</b>, which GCC rejects as an invalid  option  in  any  actual  compilation
           (rather  than  preprocessing, assembly or linking).  To get just a warning, setting <b>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</b>
           to <b>-w%n-fcompare-debug</b> <b>not</b> <b>overridden</b> will do.

       <b>-fcompare-debug-second</b>
           This  option  is  implicitly  passed  to  the  compiler  for  the  second  compilation  requested  by
           <b>-fcompare-debug</b>,  along with options to silence warnings, and omitting other options that would cause
           the compiler to produce output to files or to standard output as  a  side  effect.   Dump  files  and
           preserved  temporary  files  are  renamed  so as to contain the ".gk" additional extension during the
           second compilation, to avoid overwriting those generated by the first.

           When this option is passed to the compiler driver, it causes the <u>first</u>  compilation  to  be  skipped,
           which makes it useful for little other than debugging the compiler proper.

       <b>-gtoggle</b>
           Turn  off generation of debug info, if leaving out this option generates it, or turn it on at level 2
           otherwise.  The position of this argument in the command line does not matter; it takes effect  after
           all  other  options  are  processed,  and it does so only once, no matter how many times it is given.
           This is mainly intended to be used with <b>-fcompare-debug</b>.

       <b>-fvar-tracking-assignments-toggle</b>
           Toggle <b>-fvar-tracking-assignments</b>, in the same way that <b>-gtoggle</b> toggles <b>-g</b>.

       <b>-Q</b>  Makes the compiler print out each function name as it is compiled, and print  some  statistics  about
           each pass when it finishes.

       <b>-ftime-report</b>
           Makes the compiler print some statistics about the time consumed by each pass when it finishes.

       <b>-ftime-report-details</b>
           Record the time consumed by infrastructure parts separately for each pass.

       <b>-fira-verbose=</b><u>n</u>
           Control  the  verbosity of the dump file for the integrated register allocator.  The default value is
           5.  If the value <u>n</u> is greater or equal to 10, the dump output is sent to stderr using the same format
           as <u>n</u> minus 10.

       <b>-flto-report</b>
           Prints a report with internal details on the workings of the link-time optimizer.   The  contents  of
           this report vary from version to version.  It is meant to be useful to GCC developers when processing
           object files in LTO mode (via <b>-flto</b>).

           Disabled by default.

       <b>-flto-report-wpa</b>
           Like <b>-flto-report</b>, but only print for the WPA phase of link-time optimization.

       <b>-fmem-report</b>
           Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent memory allocation when it finishes.

       <b>-fmem-report-wpa</b>
           Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent memory allocation for the WPA phase only.

       <b>-fpre-ipa-mem-report</b>
       <b>-fpost-ipa-mem-report</b>
           Makes  the  compiler  print  some  statistics  about  permanent  memory  allocation  before  or after
           interprocedural optimization.

       <b>-fprofile-report</b>
           Makes the compiler print some statistics about consistency of the (estimated) profile and  effect  of
           individual passes.

       <b>-fstack-usage</b>
           Makes  the  compiler  output  stack  usage information for the program, on a per-function basis.  The
           filename for the dump is made by appending <u>.su</u> to the <u>auxname</u>.  <u>auxname</u> is generated from the name of
           the output file, if explicitly specified and it is not an executable, otherwise it is the basename of
           the source file.  An entry is made up of three fields:

           *   The name of the function.

           *   A number of bytes.

           *   One or more qualifiers: "static", "dynamic", "bounded".

           The qualifier "static" means that the function manipulates the stack statically: a  fixed  number  of
           bytes  are  allocated  for  the  frame  on  function  entry  and  released on function exit; no stack
           adjustments are otherwise made in the function.  The second field is this fixed number of bytes.

           The qualifier "dynamic" means that the function manipulates the stack dynamically: in addition to the
           static allocation described above, stack adjustments are made  in  the  body  of  the  function,  for
           example to push/pop arguments around function calls.  If the qualifier "bounded" is also present, the
           amount  of these adjustments is bounded at compile time and the second field is an upper bound of the
           total amount of stack used by the function.  If it is not present, the amount of these adjustments is
           not bounded at compile time and the second field only represents the bounded part.

       <b>-fstats</b>
           Emit statistics about front-end processing at the end of the compilation.  This option  is  supported
           only by the C++ front end, and the information is generally only useful to the G++ development team.

       <b>-fdbg-cnt-list</b>
           Print the name and the counter upper bound for all debug counters.

       <b>-fdbg-cnt=</b><u>counter-value-list</u>
           Set  the  internal debug counter lower and upper bound.  <u>counter-value-list</u> is a comma-separated list
           of <u>name</u>:<u>lower_bound1</u>-<u>upper_bound1</u> [:<u>lower_bound2</u>-<u>upper_bound2</u>...] tuples which sets the name  of  the
           counter  and  list  of  closed intervals.  The <u>lower_bound</u> is optional and is zero initialized if not
           set.  For example, with <b>-fdbg-cnt=dce:2-4:10-11,tail_call:10</b>,  dbg_cnt(dce)  returns  true  only  for
           second,  third,  fourth,  tenth and eleventh invocation.  For dbg_cnt(tail_call) true is returned for
           first 10 invocations.

       <b>-print-file-name=</b><u>library</u>
           Print the full absolute name of the library file <u>library</u> that would be used when linking---and  don't
           do  anything  else.  With this option, GCC does not compile or link anything; it just prints the file
           name.

       <b>-print-multi-directory</b>
           Print the directory name corresponding to the multilib selected by any other switches present in  the
           command line.  This directory is supposed to exist in <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b>.

       <b>-print-multi-lib</b>
           Print the mapping from multilib directory names to compiler switches that enable them.  The directory
           name  is separated from the switches by <b>;</b>, and each switch starts with an <b>@</b> instead of the <b>-</b>, without
           spaces between multiple switches.  This is supposed to ease shell processing.

       <b>-print-multi-os-directory</b>
           Print the path to OS libraries for the selected multilib, relative to some <u>lib</u> subdirectory.   If  OS
           libraries  are  present in the <u>lib</u> subdirectory and no multilibs are used, this is usually just <u>.</u>, if
           OS libraries are present in <u>libsuffix</u> sibling  directories  this  prints  e.g.  <u>..<a href="file:/lib64">/lib64</a></u>,  <u>..<a href="file:/lib">/lib</a></u>  or
           <u>../lib32</u>,  or  if OS libraries are present in <u>lib/subdir</u> subdirectories it prints e.g. <u>amd64</u>, <u>sparcv9</u>
           or <u>ev6</u>.

       <b>-print-multiarch</b>
           Print the path to OS libraries for the selected multiarch, relative to some <u>lib</u> subdirectory.

       <b>-print-prog-name=</b><u>program</u>
           Like <b>-print-file-name</b>, but searches for a program such as <b>cpp</b>.

       <b>-print-libgcc-file-name</b>
           Same as <b>-print-file-name=libgcc.a</b>.

           This is useful when you use <b>-nostdlib</b> or <b>-nodefaultlibs</b> but you do want to link with  <u>libgcc.a</u>.   You
           can do:

                   gcc -nostdlib &lt;files&gt;... `gcc -print-libgcc-file-name`

       <b>-print-search-dirs</b>
           Print the name of the configured installation directory and a list of program and library directories
           <b>gcc</b> searches---and don't do anything else.

           This is useful when <b>gcc</b> prints the error message <b>installation</b> <b>problem,</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>exec</b> <b>cpp0:</b> <b>No</b> <b>such</b> <b>file</b>
           <b>or</b>  <b>directory</b>.   To  resolve this you either need to put <u>cpp0</u> and the other compiler components where
           <b>gcc</b> expects to find them, or you can set the environment variable <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b>  to  the  directory
           where you installed them.  Don't forget the trailing <b>/</b>.

       <b>-print-sysroot</b>
           Print  the  target  sysroot  directory  that  is used during compilation.  This is the target sysroot
           specified either at configure time or using the <b>--sysroot</b> option, possibly with an extra suffix  that
           depends on compilation options.  If no target sysroot is specified, the option prints nothing.

       <b>-print-sysroot-headers-suffix</b>
           Print  the  suffix  added  to  the target sysroot when searching for headers, or give an error if the
           compiler is not configured with such a suffix---and don't do anything else.

       <b>-dumpmachine</b>
           Print the compiler's target machine (for example, <b>i686-pc-linux-gnu</b>)---and don't do anything else.

       <b>-dumpversion</b>
           Print the compiler version (for example, 3.0, 6.3.0 or 7)---and don't do anything else.  This is  the
           compiler  version  used  in  filesystem  paths  and  specs.  Depending  on  how the compiler has been
           configured it can be just a single number (major version), two numbers separated by a dot (major  and
           minor version) or three numbers separated by dots (major, minor and patchlevel version).

       <b>-dumpfullversion</b>
           Print  the  full  compiler  version---and  don't do anything else. The output is always three numbers
           separated by dots, major, minor and patchlevel version.

       <b>-dumpspecs</b>
           Print the compiler's built-in specs---and don't do anything else.  (This is used when GCC  itself  is
           being built.)

   <b>Machine-Dependent</b> <b>Options</b>
       Each  target machine supported by GCC can have its own options---for example, to allow you to compile for
       a particular processor variant or ABI,  or  to  control  optimizations  specific  to  that  machine.   By
       convention, the names of machine-specific options start with <b>-m</b>.

       Some  configurations  of  the  compiler  also  support  additional  target-specific  options, usually for
       compatibility with other compilers on the same platform.

       <u>AArch64</u> <u>Options</u>

       These options are defined for AArch64 implementations:

       <b>-mabi=</b><u>name</u>
           Generate code for the specified data model.  Permissible values are <b>ilp32</b> for  SysV-like  data  model
           where int, long int and pointers are 32 bits, and <b>lp64</b> for SysV-like data model where int is 32 bits,
           but long int and pointers are 64 bits.

           The  default depends on the specific target configuration.  Note that the LP64 and ILP32 ABIs are not
           link-compatible; you must compile your entire program with the same ABI, and link with  a  compatible
           set of libraries.

       <b>-mbig-endian</b>
           Generate big-endian code.  This is the default when GCC is configured for an <b>aarch64_be-*-*</b> target.

       <b>-mgeneral-regs-only</b>
           Generate  code  which  uses  only the general-purpose registers.  This will prevent the compiler from
           using floating-point and Advanced SIMD  registers  but  will  not  impose  any  restrictions  on  the
           assembler.

       <b>-mlittle-endian</b>
           Generate  little-endian  code.  This is the default when GCC is configured for an <b>aarch64-*-*</b> but not
           an <b>aarch64_be-*-*</b> target.

       <b>-mcmodel=tiny</b>
           Generate code for the tiny code model.  The program and its statically defined symbols must be within
           1MB of each other.  Programs can be statically or dynamically linked.

       <b>-mcmodel=small</b>
           Generate code for the small code model.  The program and  its  statically  defined  symbols  must  be
           within  4GB  of  each  other.  Programs can be statically or dynamically linked.  This is the default
           code model.

       <b>-mcmodel=large</b>
           Generate code for the large code model.  This makes no  assumptions  about  addresses  and  sizes  of
           sections.   Programs  can  be statically linked only.  The <b>-mcmodel=large</b> option is incompatible with
           <b>-mabi=ilp32</b>, <b>-fpic</b> and <b>-fPIC</b>.

       <b>-mstrict-align</b>
       <b>-mno-strict-align</b>
           Avoid or allow generating memory accesses that may not be aligned on a  natural  object  boundary  as
           described in the architecture specification.

       <b>-momit-leaf-frame-pointer</b>
       <b>-mno-omit-leaf-frame-pointer</b>
           Omit or keep the frame pointer in leaf functions.  The former behavior is the default.

       <b>-mstack-protector-guard=</b><u>guard</u>
       <b>-mstack-protector-guard-reg=</b><u>reg</u>
       <b>-mstack-protector-guard-offset=</b><u>offset</u>
           Generate  stack  protection  code using canary at <u>guard</u>.  Supported locations are <b>global</b> for a global
           canary or <b>sysreg</b> for a canary in an appropriate system register.

           With     the     latter     choice     the      options      <b>-mstack-protector-guard-reg=</b><u>reg</u>      and
           <b>-mstack-protector-guard-offset=</b><u>offset</u>  furthermore  specify  which  system  register  to  use as base
           register for reading the canary, and from what offset from that base register. There  is  no  default
           register or offset as this is entirely for use within the Linux kernel.

       <b>-mtls-dialect=desc</b>
           Use  TLS  descriptors  as  the  thread-local storage mechanism for dynamic accesses of TLS variables.
           This is the default.

       <b>-mtls-dialect=traditional</b>
           Use traditional TLS as the thread-local storage mechanism for dynamic accesses of TLS variables.

       <b>-mtls-size=</b><u>size</u>
           Specify bit size of immediate TLS offsets.  Valid values are 12, 24, 32, 48.   This  option  requires
           binutils 2.26 or newer.

       <b>-mfix-cortex-a53-835769</b>
       <b>-mno-fix-cortex-a53-835769</b>
           Enable  or  disable  the  workaround  for  the  ARM  Cortex-A53 erratum number 835769.  This involves
           inserting a NOP instruction  between  memory  instructions  and  64-bit  integer  multiply-accumulate
           instructions.

       <b>-mfix-cortex-a53-843419</b>
       <b>-mno-fix-cortex-a53-843419</b>
           Enable  or  disable  the  workaround  for  the  ARM  Cortex-A53  erratum number 843419.  This erratum
           workaround is made at link time and this will only pass the corresponding flag to the linker.

       <b>-mlow-precision-recip-sqrt</b>
       <b>-mno-low-precision-recip-sqrt</b>
           Enable or disable the reciprocal square root approximation.   This  option  only  has  an  effect  if
           <b>-ffast-math</b>  or  <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations</b>  is  used  as  well.  Enabling this reduces precision of
           reciprocal square root results to about 16 bits for single  precision  and  to  32  bits  for  double
           precision.

       <b>-mlow-precision-sqrt</b>
       <b>-mno-low-precision-sqrt</b>
           Enable  or  disable  the square root approximation.  This option only has an effect if <b>-ffast-math</b> or
           <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations</b> is used as well.  Enabling this reduces precision of square root  results
           to  about  16  bits for single precision and to 32 bits for double precision.  If enabled, it implies
           <b>-mlow-precision-recip-sqrt</b>.

       <b>-mlow-precision-div</b>
       <b>-mno-low-precision-div</b>
           Enable or disable the division approximation.  This option only  has  an  effect  if  <b>-ffast-math</b>  or
           <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations</b>  is used as well.  Enabling this reduces precision of division results to
           about 16 bits for single precision and to 32 bits for double precision.

       <b>-mtrack-speculation</b>
       <b>-mno-track-speculation</b>
           Enable or disable generation of additional code to track speculative  execution  through  conditional
           branches.    The  tracking  state  can  then  be  used  by  the  compiler  when  expanding  calls  to
           "__builtin_speculation_safe_copy" to permit a more efficient code sequence to be generated.

       <b>-moutline-atomics</b>
       <b>-mno-outline-atomics</b>
           Enable or disable calls to out-of-line helpers to implement atomic operations.  These  helpers  will,
           at  runtime,  determine if the LSE instructions from ARMv8.1-A can be used; if not, they will use the
           load/store-exclusive instructions that are present in the base ARMv8.0 ISA.

           This option is only applicable when compiling for the base ARMv8.0 instruction set.  If using a later
           revision, e.g. <b>-march=armv8.1-a</b> or <b>-march=armv8-a+lse</b>, the ARMv8.1-Atomics instructions will be  used
           directly.   The  same applies when using <b>-mcpu=</b> when the selected cpu supports the <b>lse</b> feature.  This
           option is on by default.

       <b>-march=</b><u>name</u>
           Specify the name of the target architecture and, optionally, one or  more  feature  modifiers.   This
           option has the form <b>-march=</b><u>arch</u>{<b>+</b>[<b>no</b>]<u>feature</u>}*.

           The  table  below  summarizes  the  permissible  values for <u>arch</u> and the features that they enable by
           default:

           <u>arch</u> <u>value</u> : <u>Architecture</u> : <u>Includes</u> <u>by</u> <u>default</u>
           <b>armv8-a</b> : Armv8-A : <b>+fp</b>, <b>+simd</b>

           <b>armv8-r</b> : Armv8-R : <b>armv8-r</b>

           The value <b>native</b> is available on native AArch64  GNU/Linux  and  causes  the  compiler  to  pick  the
           architecture  of  the  host system.  This option has no effect if the compiler is unable to recognize
           the architecture of the host system,

           The permissible values for <u>feature</u> are listed in the sub-section on <b>aarch64-feature-modifiers,,-march</b>
           <b>and</b> <b>-mcpu</b> <b>Feature</b> <b>Modifiers</b>.  Where conflicting  feature  modifiers  are  specified,  the  right-most
           feature is used.

           GCC  uses  <u>name</u> to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when generating assembly code.  If
           <b>-march</b> is specified without either of <b>-mtune</b> or <b>-mcpu</b> also being specified,  the  code  is  tuned  to
           perform well across a range of target processors implementing the target architecture.

       <b>-mtune=</b><u>name</u>
           Specify  the  name  of  the  target  processor for which GCC should tune the performance of the code.
           Permissible values for this option are:  <b>generic</b>,  <b>cortex-a35</b>,  <b>cortex-a53</b>,  <b>cortex-a55</b>,  <b>cortex-a57</b>,

           and <b>native</b>.

           The       values       <b>cortex-a57.cortex-a53</b>,      <b>cortex-a72.cortex-a53</b>,      <b>cortex-a73.cortex-a35</b>,
           <b>cortex-a73.cortex-a53</b>, <b>cortex-a75.cortex-a55</b>, <b>cortex-a76.cortex-a55</b> specify that GCC should tune  for
           a big.LITTLE system.

           The  value  <b>neoverse-512tvb</b>  specifies that GCC should tune for Neoverse cores that (a) implement SVE
           and (b) have a total vector bandwidth of 512 bits per cycle.  In other words, the option tells GCC to
           tune for Neoverse cores that can execute 4 128-bit Advanced SIMD arithmetic instructions a cycle  and
           that  can execute an equivalent number of SVE arithmetic instructions per cycle (2 for 256-bit SVE, 4
           for 128-bit SVE).  This is more general than tuning for a specific core like Neoverse V1 but is  more
           specific than the default tuning described below.

           Additionally  on  native  AArch64  GNU/Linux  systems  the value <b>native</b> tunes performance to the host
           system.  This option has no effect if the compiler is unable to recognize the processor of  the  host
           system.

           Where  none  of  <b>-mtune=</b>, <b>-mcpu=</b> or <b>-march=</b> are specified, the code is tuned to perform well across a
           range of target processors.

           This option cannot be suffixed by feature modifiers.

       <b>-mcpu=</b><u>name</u>
           Specify the name of the target processor, optionally suffixed by one or more feature modifiers.  This
           option has the form <b>-mcpu=</b><u>cpu</u>{<b>+</b>[<b>no</b>]<u>feature</u>}*, where the permissible values for <u>cpu</u> are  the  same  as
           those  available for <b>-mtune</b>.  The permissible values for <u>feature</u> are documented in the sub-section on
           <b>aarch64-feature-modifiers,,-march</b> <b>and</b> <b>-mcpu</b> <b>Feature</b> <b>Modifiers</b>.  Where conflicting  feature  modifiers
           are specified, the right-most feature is used.

           GCC uses <u>name</u> to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when generating assembly code (as if
           by <b>-march</b>) and to determine the target processor for which to tune for performance (as if by <b>-mtune</b>).
           Where  this  option  is used in conjunction with <b>-march</b> or <b>-mtune</b>, those options take precedence over
           the appropriate part of this option.

           <b>-mcpu=neoverse-512tvb</b> is special in that it does not refer to a specific core, but instead refers  to
           all  Neoverse cores that (a) implement SVE and (b) have a total vector bandwidth of 512 bits a cycle.
           Unless overridden by <b>-march</b>, <b>-mcpu=neoverse-512tvb</b> generates code that can run on a Neoverse V1 core,
           since Neoverse V1 is the first Neoverse core with these properties.   Unless  overridden  by  <b>-mtune</b>,
           <b>-mcpu=neoverse-512tvb</b> tunes code in the same way as for <b>-mtune=neoverse-512tvb</b>.

       <b>-moverride=</b><u>string</u>
           Override  tuning  decisions  made  by  the  back-end  in  response  to a <b>-mtune=</b> switch.  The syntax,
           semantics, and accepted values for <u>string</u> in this option are not guaranteed to be  consistent  across
           releases.

           This option is only intended to be useful when developing GCC.

       <b>-mverbose-cost-dump</b>
           Enable  verbose  cost  model  dumping  in  the  debug dump files.  This option is provided for use in
           debugging the compiler.

       <b>-mpc-relative-literal-loads</b>
       <b>-mno-pc-relative-literal-loads</b>
           Enable or disable PC-relative literal loads.  With this option literal pools  are  accessed  using  a
           single  instruction  and  emitted  after each function.  This limits the maximum size of functions to
           1MB.  This is enabled by default for <b>-mcmodel=tiny</b>.

       <b>-msign-return-address=</b><u>scope</u>
           Select the function scope on which return address signing will be applied.   Permissible  values  are
           <b>none</b>,  which  disables  return address signing, <b>non-leaf</b>, which enables pointer signing for functions
           which are not leaf functions, and <b>all</b>, which enables pointer signing for all functions.  The  default
           value is <b>none</b>. This option has been deprecated by -mbranch-protection.

       <b>-mbranch-protection=</b><u>none</u><b>|</b><u>standard</u><b>|</b><u>pac-ret</u><b>[+</b><u>leaf</u><b>+</b><u>b-key</u><b>]|</b><u>bti</u>
           Select  the branch protection features to use.  <b>none</b> is the default and turns off all types of branch
           protection.  <b>standard</b> turns on all types of branch protection features.  If a feature has  additional
           tuning  options, then <b>standard</b> sets it to its standard level.  <b>pac-ret[+</b><u>leaf</u><b>]</b> turns on return address
           signing to its standard level: signing functions that save the return  address  to  memory  (non-leaf
           functions  will  practically always do this) using the a-key.  The optional argument <b>leaf</b> can be used
           to extend the signing to include leaf functions.  The optional argument <b>b-key</b> can be used to sign the
           functions with the B-key instead of the A-key.  <b>bti</b> turns on branch target identification mechanism.

       <b>-mharden-sls=</b><u>opts</u>
           Enable compiler hardening against straight line speculation (SLS).  <u>opts</u> is a comma-separated list of
           the following options:

           <b>retbr</b>
           <b>blr</b>

           In addition, <b>-mharden-sls=all</b> enables all SLS hardening  while  <b>-mharden-sls=none</b>  disables  all  SLS
           hardening.

       <b>-msve-vector-bits=</b><u>bits</u>
           Specify  the  number  of  bits in an SVE vector register.  This option only has an effect when SVE is
           enabled.

           GCC supports two forms of SVE code generation: "vector-length agnostic" output that  works  with  any
           size of vector register and "vector-length specific" output that allows GCC to make assumptions about
           the  vector  length  when  it  is  useful for optimization reasons.  The possible values of <b>bits</b> are:
           <b>scalable</b>, <b>128</b>, <b>256</b>, <b>512</b>, <b>1024</b> and <b>2048</b>.  Specifying <b>scalable</b> selects vector-length  agnostic  output.
           At present <b>-msve-vector-bits=128</b> also generates vector-length agnostic output for big-endian targets.
           All  other  values  generate vector-length specific code.  The behavior of these values may change in
           future releases and no value except <b>scalable</b> should be relied on for producing code that is  portable
           across different hardware SVE vector lengths.

           The default is <b>-msve-vector-bits=scalable</b>, which produces vector-length agnostic code.

       <b>-march</b> and <b>-mcpu</b> Feature Modifiers

       <u>Adapteva</u> <u>Epiphany</u> <u>Options</u>

       These <b>-m</b> options are defined for Adapteva Epiphany:

       <b>-mhalf-reg-file</b>
           Don't allocate any register in the range "r32"..."r63".  That allows code to run on hardware variants
           that lack these registers.

       <b>-mprefer-short-insn-regs</b>
           Preferentially  allocate  registers  that  allow  short  instruction  generation.  This can result in
           increased instruction count, so this may either reduce or increase overall code size.

       <b>-mbranch-cost=</b><u>num</u>
           Set the cost of branches to roughly <u>num</u> "simple" instructions.  This cost is only a heuristic and  is
           not guaranteed to produce consistent results across releases.

       <b>-mcmove</b>
           Enable the generation of conditional moves.

       <b>-mnops=</b><u>num</u>
           Emit <u>num</u> NOPs before every other generated instruction.

       <b>-mno-soft-cmpsf</b>
           For single-precision floating-point comparisons, emit an "fsub" instruction and test the flags.  This
           is  faster than a software comparison, but can get incorrect results in the presence of NaNs, or when
           two different small numbers are compared such that their  difference  is  calculated  as  zero.   The
           default is <b>-msoft-cmpsf</b>, which uses slower, but IEEE-compliant, software comparisons.

       <b>-mstack-offset=</b><u>num</u>
           Set the offset between the top of the stack and the stack pointer.  E.g., a value of 8 means that the
           eight  bytes  in  the  range  "sp+0...sp+7"  can  be used by leaf functions without stack allocation.
           Values other than <b>8</b> or <b>16</b> are untested and unlikely to work.  Note also that this option changes  the
           ABI;  compiling  a  program  with a different stack offset than the libraries have been compiled with
           generally does not work.  This option can be useful if you want to  evaluate  if  a  different  stack
           offset  would  give  you  better  code, but to actually use a different stack offset to build working
           programs, it is recommended to configure the toolchain with the  appropriate  <b>--with-stack-offset=</b><u>num</u>
           option.

       <b>-mno-round-nearest</b>
           Make  the  scheduler  assume  that  the  rounding  mode  has  been set to truncating.  The default is
           <b>-mround-nearest</b>.

       <b>-mlong-calls</b>
           If not otherwise specified by an attribute, assume all calls might be beyond the offset range of  the
           "b"  / "bl" instructions, and therefore load the function address into a register before performing a
           (otherwise direct) call.  This is the default.

       <b>-mshort-calls</b>
           If not otherwise specified by an attribute, assume all direct calls are in the range  of  the  "b"  /
           "bl" instructions, so use these instructions for direct calls.  The default is <b>-mlong-calls</b>.

       <b>-msmall16</b>
           Assume  addresses can be loaded as 16-bit unsigned values.  This does not apply to function addresses
           for which <b>-mlong-calls</b> semantics are in effect.

       <b>-mfp-mode=</b><u>mode</u>
           Set the prevailing mode of the floating-point unit.  This determines the floating-point mode that  is
           provided  and  expected  at  function  call  and  return  time.   Making this mode match the mode you
           predominantly need at  function  start  can  make  your  programs  smaller  and  faster  by  avoiding
           unnecessary mode switches.

           <u>mode</u> can be set to one the following values:

           <b>caller</b>
               Any mode at function entry is valid, and retained or restored when the function returns, and when
               it calls other functions.  This mode is useful for compiling libraries or other compilation units
               you  might  want  to incorporate into different programs with different prevailing FPU modes, and
               the convenience of being able to use a single object file outweighs the size and  speed  overhead
               for any extra mode switching that might be needed, compared with what would be needed with a more
               specific choice of prevailing FPU mode.

           <b>truncate</b>
               This  is  the mode used for floating-point calculations with truncating (i.e. round towards zero)
               rounding mode.  That includes conversion from floating point to integer.

           <b>round-nearest</b>
               This is the mode used for  floating-point  calculations  with  round-to-nearest-or-even  rounding
               mode.

           <b>int</b> This  is  the  mode  used  to perform integer calculations in the FPU, e.g.  integer multiply, or
               integer multiply-and-accumulate.

           The default is <b>-mfp-mode=caller</b>

       <b>-mno-split-lohi</b>
       <b>-mno-postinc</b>
       <b>-mno-postmodify</b>
           Code generation tweaks that disable, respectively, splitting of 32-bit  loads,  generation  of  post-
           increment  addresses,  and  generation  of  post-modify  addresses.   The  defaults  are <b>msplit-lohi</b>,
           <b>-mpost-inc</b>, and <b>-mpost-modify</b>.

       <b>-mnovect-double</b>
           Change the preferred SIMD mode to SImode.   The  default  is  <b>-mvect-double</b>,  which  uses  DImode  as
           preferred SIMD mode.

       <b>-max-vect-align=</b><u>num</u>
           The  maximum  alignment for SIMD vector mode types.  <u>num</u> may be 4 or 8.  The default is 8.  Note that
           this is an ABI change, even though many library function interfaces are unaffected if they don't  use
           SIMD vector modes in places that affect size and/or alignment of relevant types.

       <b>-msplit-vecmove-early</b>
           Split  vector  moves  into  single word moves before reload.  In theory this can give better register
           allocation, but so far the reverse seems to be generally the case.

       <b>-m1reg-</b><u>reg</u>
           Specify a register to hold the constant -1, which makes loading small negative constants and  certain
           bitmasks  faster.   Allowable values for <u>reg</u> are <b>r43</b> and <b>r63</b>, which specify use of that register as a
           fixed register, and <b>none</b>, which means that no register is used for  this  purpose.   The  default  is
           <b>-m1reg-none</b>.

       <u>AMD</u> <u>GCN</u> <u>Options</u>

       These options are defined specifically for the AMD GCN port.

       <b>-march=</b><u>gpu</u>

       <b>-mirq-ctrl-saved=</b><u>register-range</u><b>,</b> <u>blink</u><b>,</b> <u>lp_count</u>
           Specifies general-purposes registers that the processor  automatically  saves/restores  on  interrupt
           entry  and  exit.   <u>register-range</u>  is  specified as two registers separated by a dash.  The register
           range always starts with "r0", the upper limit is "fp" register.  <u>blink</u> and  <u>lp_count</u>  are  optional.
           This option is only valid for ARC EM and ARC HS cores.

       <b>-mrgf-banked-regs=</b><u>number</u>
           Specifies  the  number  of  registers  replicated in second register bank on entry to fast interrupt.
           Fast interrupts are interrupts with the highest priority level P0.  These interrupts save only PC and
           STATUS32 registers to avoid memory transactions during interrupt entry and exit sequences.  Use  this
           option  when you are using fast interrupts in an ARC V2 family processor.  Permitted values are 4, 8,
           16, and 32.

       <b>-mlpc-width=</b><u>width</u>
           Specify the width of the "lp_count" register.  Valid values for <u>width</u> are 8, 16, 20, 24,  28  and  32
           bits.   The  default  width is fixed to 32 bits.  If the width is less than 32, the compiler does not
           attempt to transform loops in your program to use the zero-delay loop mechanism unless  it  is  known
           that  the  "lp_count"  register  can  hold  the  required loop-counter value.  Depending on the width
           specified, the compiler and run-time library might continue to use the  loop  mechanism  for  various
           needs.  This option defines macro "__ARC_LPC_WIDTH__" with the value of <u>width</u>.

       <b>-mrf16</b>
           This  option  instructs  the  compiler  to  generate  code for a 16-entry register file.  This option
           defines the "__ARC_RF16__" preprocessor macro.

       <b>-mbranch-index</b>
           Enable use of "bi" or "bih" instructions to implement jump tables.

       The following options are passed through to the assembler, and also define preprocessor macro symbols.

       <b>-mdsp-packa</b>
           Passed down to the assembler to enable the DSP Pack A extensions.  Also sets the preprocessor  symbol
           "__Xdsp_packa".  This option is deprecated.

       <b>-mdvbf</b>
           Passed  down  to  the  assembler  to  enable  the  dual  Viterbi  butterfly extension.  Also sets the
           preprocessor symbol "__Xdvbf".  This option is deprecated.

       <b>-mlock</b>
           Passed down to the assembler to enable the locked load/store conditional extension.   Also  sets  the
           preprocessor symbol "__Xlock".

       <b>-mmac-d16</b>
           Passed  down  to  the  assembler.   Also  sets the preprocessor symbol "__Xxmac_d16".  This option is
           deprecated.

       <b>-mmac-24</b>
           Passed down to the assembler.  Also sets  the  preprocessor  symbol  "__Xxmac_24".   This  option  is
           deprecated.

       <b>-mrtsc</b>
           Passed  down  to  the  assembler to enable the 64-bit time-stamp counter extension instruction.  Also
           sets the preprocessor symbol "__Xrtsc".  This option is deprecated.

       <b>-mswape</b>
           Passed down to the assembler to enable the swap byte ordering extension instruction.  Also  sets  the
           preprocessor symbol "__Xswape".

       <b>-mtelephony</b>
           Passed  down  to  the  assembler to enable dual- and single-operand instructions for telephony.  Also
           sets the preprocessor symbol "__Xtelephony".  This option is deprecated.

       <b>-mxy</b>
           Passed down to the assembler to enable the XY memory extension.  Also sets  the  preprocessor  symbol
           "__Xxy".

       The following options control how the assembly code is annotated:

       <b>-misize</b>
           Annotate assembler instructions with estimated addresses.

       <b>-mannotate-align</b>
           Explain what alignment considerations lead to the decision to make an instruction short or long.

       The following options are passed through to the linker:

       <b>-marclinux</b>
           Passed  through to the linker, to specify use of the "arclinux" emulation.  This option is enabled by
           default in tool chains built for "arc-linux-uclibc" and "arceb-linux-uclibc" targets  when  profiling
           is not requested.

       <b>-marclinux_prof</b>
           Passed  through  to  the  linker,  to  specify  use of the "arclinux_prof" emulation.  This option is
           enabled by default in tool chains built for "arc-linux-uclibc" and "arceb-linux-uclibc" targets  when
           profiling is requested.

       The following options control the semantics of generated code:

       <b>-mlong-calls</b>
           Generate calls as register indirect calls, thus providing access to the full 32-bit address range.

       <b>-mmedium-calls</b>
           Don't  use  less  than  25-bit  addressing  range  for  calls,  which  is the offset available for an
           unconditional branch-and-link instruction.  Conditional execution of function calls is suppressed, to
           allow use of the 25-bit range, rather than the 21-bit range with conditional  branch-and-link.   This
           is the default for tool chains built for "arc-linux-uclibc" and "arceb-linux-uclibc" targets.

       <b>-G</b> <u>num</u>
           Put definitions of externally-visible data in a small data section if that data is no bigger than <u>num</u>
           bytes.   The default value of <u>num</u> is 4 for any ARC configuration, or 8 when we have double load/store
           operations.

       <b>-mno-sdata</b>
           Do not generate sdata references.  This is the default for tool chains built  for  "arc-linux-uclibc"
           and "arceb-linux-uclibc" targets.

       <b>-mvolatile-cache</b>
           Use ordinarily cached memory accesses for volatile references.  This is the default.

       <b>-mno-volatile-cache</b>
           Enable cache bypass for volatile references.

       The following options fine tune code generation:

       <b>-malign-call</b>
           Do alignment optimizations for call instructions.

       <b>-mauto-modify-reg</b>
           Enable the use of pre/post modify with register displacement.

       <b>-mbbit-peephole</b>
           Enable bbit peephole2.

       <b>-mno-brcc</b>
           This  option  disables  a  target-specific  pass in <u>arc_reorg</u> to generate compare-and-branch ("br<u>cc</u>")
           instructions.  It has no effect on generation of these instructions driven by the combiner pass.

       <b>-mcase-vector-pcrel</b>
           Use PC-relative switch case tables to enable case table shortening.  This is the default for <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-mcompact-casesi</b>
           Enable compact "casesi" pattern.  This is the default for <b>-Os</b>, and only available  for  ARCv1  cores.
           This option is deprecated.

       <b>-mno-cond-exec</b>
           Disable the ARCompact-specific pass to generate conditional execution instructions.

           Due  to  delay  slot  scheduling and interactions between operand numbers, literal sizes, instruction
           lengths, and  the  support  for  conditional  execution,  the  target-independent  pass  to  generate
           conditional  execution is often lacking, so the ARC port has kept a special pass around that tries to
           find  more  conditional  execution  generation  opportunities  after  register   allocation,   branch
           shortening,  and delay slot scheduling have been done.  This pass generally, but not always, improves
           performance and code size, at the cost of extra compilation time, which is why there is an option  to
           switch  it  off.  If you have a problem with call instructions exceeding their allowable offset range
           because they are conditionalized, you should consider using <b>-mmedium-calls</b> instead.

       <b>-mearly-cbranchsi</b>
           Enable pre-reload use of the "cbranchsi" pattern.

       <b>-mexpand-adddi</b>
           Expand "adddi3" and "subdi3" at RTL  generation  time  into  "add.f",  "adc"  etc.   This  option  is
           deprecated.

       <b>-mindexed-loads</b>
           Enable  the  use  of indexed loads.  This can be problematic because some optimizers then assume that
           indexed stores exist, which is not the case.

       <b>-mlra</b>
           Enable Local Register Allocation.  This is still experimental for ARC, so  by  default  the  compiler
           uses standard reload (i.e. <b>-mno-lra</b>).

       <b>-mlra-priority-none</b>
           Don't indicate any priority for target registers.

       <b>-mlra-priority-compact</b>
           Indicate target register priority for r0..r3 / r12..r15.

       <b>-mlra-priority-noncompact</b>
           Reduce target register priority for r0..r3 / r12..r15.

       <b>-mmillicode</b>
           When  optimizing  for  size (using <b>-Os</b>), prologues and epilogues that have to save or restore a large
           number of registers are often shortened by using call to  a  special  function  in  libgcc;  this  is
           referred  to  as  a <u>millicode</u> call.  As these calls can pose performance issues, and/or cause linking
           issues when linking in a nonstandard way, this option is provided to turn on or  off  millicode  call
           generation.

       <b>-mcode-density-frame</b>
           This  option  enable  the  compiler to emit "enter" and "leave" instructions.  These instructions are
           only valid for CPUs with code-density feature.

       <b>-mmixed-code</b>
           Tweak register allocation to help 16-bit instruction generation.  This generally has  the  effect  of
           decreasing the average instruction size while increasing the instruction count.

       <b>-mq-class</b>
           Ths option is deprecated.  Enable <b>q</b> instruction alternatives.  This is the default for <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-mRcq</b>
           Enable <b>Rcq</b> constraint handling.  Most short code generation depends on this.  This is the default.

       <b>-mRcw</b>
           Enable <b>Rcw</b> constraint handling.  Most ccfsm condexec mostly depends on this.  This is the default.

       <b>-msize-level=</b><u>level</u>
           Fine-tune size optimization with regards to instruction lengths and alignment.  The recognized values
           for <u>level</u> are:

           <b>0</b>   No size optimization.  This level is deprecated and treated like <b>1</b>.

           <b>1</b>   Short instructions are used opportunistically.

           <b>2</b>   In addition, alignment of loops and of code after barriers are dropped.

           <b>3</b>   In addition, optional data alignment is dropped, and the option <b>Os</b> is enabled.

           This defaults to <b>3</b> when <b>-Os</b> is in effect.  Otherwise, the behavior when this is not set is equivalent
           to level <b>1</b>.

       <b>-mtune=</b><u>cpu</u>
           Set instruction scheduling parameters for <u>cpu</u>, overriding any implied by <b>-mcpu=</b>.

           Supported values for <u>cpu</u> are

           <b>ARC600</b>
               Tune for ARC600 CPU.

           <b>ARC601</b>
               Tune for ARC601 CPU.

           <b>ARC700</b>
               Tune for ARC700 CPU with standard multiplier block.

           <b>ARC700-xmac</b>
               Tune for ARC700 CPU with XMAC block.

           <b>ARC725D</b>
               Tune for ARC725D CPU.

           <b>ARC750D</b>
               Tune for ARC750D CPU.

       <b>-mmultcost=</b><u>num</u>
           Cost to assume for a multiply instruction, with <b>4</b> being equal to a normal instruction.

       <b>-munalign-prob-threshold=</b><u>probability</u>
           Set  probability threshold for unaligning branches.  When tuning for <b>ARC700</b> and optimizing for speed,
           branches without filled delay slot are  preferably  emitted  unaligned  and  long,  unless  profiling
           indicates  that  the  probability  for  the  branch to be taken is below <u>probability</u>.  The default is
           (REG_BR_PROB_BASE/2), i.e. 5000.

       The following options are maintained for backward compatibility, but  are  now  deprecated  and  will  be
       removed in a future release:

       <b>-margonaut</b>
           Obsolete FPX.

       <b>-mbig-endian</b>
       <b>-EB</b> Compile  code  for  big-endian  targets.  Use of these options is now deprecated.  Big-endian code is
           supported by configuring GCC to build "arceb-elf32" and "arceb-linux-uclibc" targets, for  which  big
           endian is the default.

       <b>-mlittle-endian</b>
       <b>-EL</b> Compile  code for little-endian targets.  Use of these options is now deprecated.  Little-endian code
           is supported by configuring GCC to build "arc-elf32" and "arc-linux-uclibc" targets, for which little
           endian is the default.

       <u>ARM</u> <u>Options</u>

       These <b>-m</b> options are defined for the ARM port:

       <b>-mabi=</b><u>name</u>
           Generate code for the specified ABI.  Permissible values are: <b>apcs-gnu</b>, <b>atpcs</b>, <b>aapcs</b>, <b>aapcs-linux</b> and
           <b>iwmmxt</b>.

       <b>-mapcs-frame</b>
           Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the ARM Procedure Call Standard for all functions, even
           if this is not strictly necessary for correct execution of the code.  Specifying <b>-fomit-frame-pointer</b>
           with  this  option  causes  the  stack frames not to be generated for leaf functions.  The default is
           <b>-mno-apcs-frame</b>.  This option is deprecated.

       <b>-mapcs</b>
           This is a synonym for <b>-mapcs-frame</b> and is deprecated.

       <b>-mthumb-interwork</b>
           Generate code that supports calling between the ARM and Thumb instruction sets.  Without this option,
           on pre-v5 architectures, the two instruction sets cannot be reliably used inside  one  program.   The
           default  is  <b>-mno-thumb-interwork</b>,  since slightly larger code is generated when <b>-mthumb-interwork</b> is
           specified.  In AAPCS configurations this option is meaningless.

       <b>-mno-sched-prolog</b>
           Prevent the reordering of instructions in the function prologue, or the merging of those  instruction
           with  the  instructions  in  the  function's  body.   This  means  that  all  functions  start with a
           recognizable set of instructions (or in fact one of a choice from a small set of  different  function
           prologues),  and  this  information can be used to locate the start of functions inside an executable
           piece of code.  The default is <b>-msched-prolog</b>.

       <b>-mfloat-abi=</b><u>name</u>
           Specifies which floating-point ABI to use.  Permissible values are: <b>soft</b>, <b>softfp</b> and <b>hard</b>.

           Specifying <b>soft</b> causes GCC to generate output containing library calls for floating-point operations.
           <b>softfp</b> allows the generation of code using hardware floating-point instructions, but still  uses  the
           soft-float  calling conventions.  <b>hard</b> allows generation of floating-point instructions and uses FPU-
           specific calling conventions.

           The default depends on the specific target configuration.  Note that the  hard-float  and  soft-float
           ABIs are not link-compatible; you must compile your entire program with the same ABI, and link with a
           compatible set of libraries.

       <b>-mgeneral-regs-only</b>
           Generate  code  which  uses  only the general-purpose registers.  This will prevent the compiler from
           using floating-point and Advanced SIMD  registers  but  will  not  impose  any  restrictions  on  the
           assembler.

       <b>-mlittle-endian</b>
           Generate  code  for  a processor running in little-endian mode.  This is the default for all standard
           configurations.

       <b>-mbig-endian</b>
           Generate code for a processor running in big-endian mode; the  default  is  to  compile  code  for  a
           little-endian processor.

       <b>-mbe8</b>
       <b>-mbe32</b>
           When  linking  a  big-endian image select between BE8 and BE32 formats.  The option has no effect for
           little-endian images and is ignored.  The default is dependent on the selected  target  architecture.
           For  ARMv6  and  later architectures the default is BE8, for older architectures the default is BE32.
           BE32 format has been deprecated by ARM.

       <b>-march=</b><u>name</u>[<b>+extension...</b>]
           This specifies the name of the target ARM architecture.  GCC uses this name to determine what kind of
           instructions it can emit when generating assembly code.  This option can be used in conjunction  with
           or instead of the <b>-mcpu=</b> option.

           Permissible  names  are:  <b>armv4t</b>,  <b>armv5t</b>,  <b>armv5te</b>, <b>armv6</b>, <b>armv6j</b>, <b>armv6k</b>, <b>armv6kz</b>, <b>armv6t2</b>, <b>armv6z</b>,
           <b>armv6zk</b>, <b>armv7</b>, <b>armv7-a</b>, <b>armv7ve</b>, <b>armv8-a</b>, <b>armv8.1-a</b>,  <b>armv8.2-a</b>,  <b>armv8.3-a</b>,  <b>armv8.4-a</b>,  <b>armv8.5-a</b>,
           <b>armv8.6-a</b>,  <b>armv7-r</b>,  <b>armv8-r</b>,  <b>armv6-m</b>,  <b>armv6s-m</b>,  <b>armv7-m</b>,  <b>armv7e-m</b>,  <b>armv8-m.base</b>, <b>armv8-m.main</b>,
           <b>armv8.1-m.main</b>, <b>iwmmxt</b> and <b>iwmmxt2</b>.

           Additionally, the following architectures, which lack support for  the  Thumb  execution  state,  are
           recognized but support is deprecated: <b>armv4</b>.

           Many  of  the  architectures  support  extensions.  These can be added by appending <b>+</b><u>extension</u> to the
           architecture name.  Extension options  are  processed  in  order  and  capabilities  accumulate.   An
           extension  will  also  enable  any necessary base extensions upon which it depends.  For example, the
           <b>+crypto</b> extension will always enable the <b>+simd</b> extension.  The exception to the additive construction
           is for extensions that are prefixed with <b>+no...</b>: these extensions disable the  specified  option  and
           any other extensions that may depend on the presence of that extension.

           For  example,  <b>-march=armv7-a+simd+nofp+vfpv4</b> is equivalent to writing <b>-march=armv7-a+vfpv4</b> since the
           <b>+simd</b> option is entirely disabled by the <b>+nofp</b> option that follows it.

           Most extension names  are  generically  named,  but  have  an  effect  that  is  dependent  upon  the
           architecture  to  which  it is applied.  For example, the <b>+simd</b> option can be applied to both <b>armv7-a</b>
           and <b>armv8-a</b> architectures, but will enable the original ARMv7-A Advanced SIMD (Neon)  extensions  for
           <b>armv7-a</b> and the ARMv8-A variant for <b>armv8-a</b>.

           The table below lists the supported extensions for each architecture.  Architectures not mentioned do
           not support any extensions.

                   <b>+vfpv3-d16</b> can be used as an alias for this  extension.   Note  that  floating-point  is  not
                   supported  by  the  base  ARMv7-M  architecture,  but is compatible with both the ARMv7-A and
                   ARMv7-R architectures.

           Additionally,  this  option  can  specify  that  GCC  should  tune  the performance of the code for a
           big.LITTLE   system.    Permissible   names    are:    <b>cortex-a15.cortex-a7</b>,    <b>cortex-a17.cortex-a7</b>,
           <b>cortex-a57.cortex-a53</b>,     <b>cortex-a72.cortex-a53</b>,    <b>cortex-a72.cortex-a35</b>,    <b>cortex-a73.cortex-a53</b>,
           <b>cortex-a75.cortex-a55</b>, <b>cortex-a76.cortex-a55</b>.

           <b>-mtune=generic-</b><u>arch</u> specifies that GCC should tune the performance for a blend of  processors  within
           architecture <u>arch</u>.  The aim is to generate code that run well on the current most popular processors,
           balancing  between  optimizations  that  benefit  some  CPUs  in  the range, and avoiding performance
           pitfalls of other CPUs.  The effects of this option may change in future GCC versions as  CPU  models
           come and go.

           <b>-mtune</b>  permits  the  same  extension  options  as <b>-mcpu</b>, but the extension options do not affect the
           tuning of the generated code.

           <b>-mtune=native</b> causes the compiler to auto-detect the CPU of the build  computer.   At  present,  this
           feature is only supported on GNU/Linux, and not all architectures are recognized.  If the auto-detect
           is unsuccessful the option has no effect.

       <b>-mcpu=</b><u>name</u>[<b>+extension...</b>]
           This  specifies  the  name of the target ARM processor.  GCC uses this name to derive the name of the
           target ARM architecture (as if specified by <b>-march</b>) and the ARM processor type for which to tune  for
           performance  (as  if  specified  by <b>-mtune</b>).  Where this option is used in conjunction with <b>-march</b> or
           <b>-mtune</b>, those options take precedence over the appropriate part of this option.

           Many of the supported CPUs implement  optional  architectural  extensions.   Where  this  is  so  the
           architectural extensions are normally enabled by default.  If implementations that lack the extension
           exist, then the extension syntax can be used to disable those extensions that have been omitted.  For
           floating-point  and  Advanced  SIMD  (Neon) instructions, the settings of the options <b>-mfloat-abi</b> and
           <b>-mfpu</b> must also be considered: floating-point and Advanced SIMD instructions will  only  be  used  if
           <b>-mfloat-abi</b>  is not set to <b>soft</b>; and any setting of <b>-mfpu</b> other than <b>auto</b> will override the available
           floating-point and SIMD extension instructions.

           For example, <b>cortex-a9</b> can be found  in  three  major  configurations:  integer  only,  with  just  a
           floating-point  unit  or  with  floating-point  and  Advanced SIMD.  The default is to enable all the
           instructions, but the extensions <b>+nosimd</b> and <b>+nofp</b> can be used to disable just the SIMD or  both  the
           SIMD and floating-point instructions respectively.

           Permissible names for this option are the same as those for <b>-mtune</b>.

           The following extension options are common to the listed CPUs:

           Additionally  the <b>generic-armv7-a</b> pseudo target defaults to VFPv3 with 16 double-precision registers.
           It supports the following extension options: <b>mp</b>, <b>sec</b>, <b>vfpv3-d16</b>, <b>vfpv3</b>,  <b>vfpv3-d16-fp16</b>,  <b>vfpv3-fp16</b>,
           <b>vfpv4-d16</b>,  <b>vfpv4</b>,  <b>neon</b>,  <b>neon-vfpv3</b>,  <b>neon-fp16</b>,  <b>neon-vfpv4</b>.  The meanings are the same as for the
           extensions to <b>-march=armv7-a</b>.

           <b>-mcpu=generic-</b><u>arch</u> is also permissible, and is equivalent to  <b>-march=</b><u>arch</u>  <b>-mtune=generic-</b><u>arch</u>.   See
           <b>-mtune</b> for more information.

           <b>-mcpu=native</b>  causes  the  compiler  to  auto-detect the CPU of the build computer.  At present, this
           feature is only supported on GNU/Linux, and not all architectures are recognized.  If the auto-detect
           is unsuccessful the option has no effect.

       <b>-mfpu=</b><u>name</u>
           This specifies what floating-point hardware (or hardware  emulation)  is  available  on  the  target.
           Permissible   names   are:  <b>auto</b>,  <b>vfpv2</b>,  <b>vfpv3</b>,  <b>vfpv3-fp16</b>,  <b>vfpv3-d16</b>,  <b>vfpv3-d16-fp16</b>,  <b>vfpv3xd</b>,
           <b>vfpv3xd-fp16</b>,  <b>neon-vfpv3</b>,  <b>neon-fp16</b>,   <b>vfpv4</b>,   <b>vfpv4-d16</b>,   <b>fpv4-sp-d16</b>,   <b>neon-vfpv4</b>,   <b>fpv5-d16</b>,
           <b>fpv5-sp-d16</b>,  <b>fp-armv8</b>,  <b>neon-fp-armv8</b>  and  <b>crypto-neon-fp-armv8</b>.   Note  that  <b>neon</b> is an alias for
           <b>neon-vfpv3</b> and <b>vfp</b> is an alias for <b>vfpv2</b>.

           The setting <b>auto</b> is the default and is special.  It causes the compiler to select the  floating-point
           and Advanced SIMD instructions based on the settings of <b>-mcpu</b> and <b>-march</b>.

           If  the  selected  floating-point  hardware  includes the NEON extension (e.g. <b>-mfpu=neon</b>), note that
           floating-point   operations   are   not   generated   by   GCC's   auto-vectorization   pass   unless
           <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations</b>  is  also  specified.   This  is  because  NEON  hardware  does not fully
           implement the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic  (in  particular  denormal  values  are
           treated as zero), so the use of NEON instructions may lead to a loss of precision.

           You  can  also  set the fpu name at function level by using the target("fpu=") function attributes or
           pragmas.

       <b>-mfp16-format=</b><u>name</u>
           Specify the format of the "__fp16" half-precision floating-point type.  Permissible names  are  <b>none</b>,
           <b>ieee</b>, and <b>alternative</b>; the default is <b>none</b>, in which case the "__fp16" type is not defined.

       <b>-mstructure-size-boundary=</b><u>n</u>
           The sizes of all structures and unions are rounded up to a multiple of the number of bits set by this
           option.   Permissible  values  are  8, 32 and 64.  The default value varies for different toolchains.
           For the COFF targeted toolchain the default value is 8.  A  value  of  64  is  only  allowed  if  the
           underlying ABI supports it.

           Specifying a larger number can produce faster, more efficient code, but can also increase the size of
           the  program.   Different  values  are potentially incompatible.  Code compiled with one value cannot
           necessarily expect to work with code or libraries compiled  with  another  value,  if  they  exchange
           information using structures or unions.

           This option is deprecated.

       <b>-mabort-on-noreturn</b>
           Generate  a  call to the function "abort" at the end of a "noreturn" function.  It is executed if the
           function tries to return.

       <b>-mlong-calls</b>
       <b>-mno-long-calls</b>
           Tells the compiler to perform function calls by first loading the address  of  the  function  into  a
           register and then performing a subroutine call on this register.  This switch is needed if the target
           function  lies  outside of the 64-megabyte addressing range of the offset-based version of subroutine
           call instruction.

           Even if this switch is enabled, not all function calls are turned into long calls.  The heuristic  is
           that  static functions, functions that have the "short_call" attribute, functions that are inside the
           scope of a "#pragma no_long_calls" directive, and  functions  whose  definitions  have  already  been
           compiled  within the current compilation unit are not turned into long calls.  The exceptions to this
           rule are that weak function definitions, functions with the "long_call" attribute  or  the  "section"
           attribute,  and  functions  that  are within the scope of a "#pragma long_calls" directive are always
           turned into long calls.

           This feature is not enabled by default.  Specifying <b>-mno-long-calls</b> restores the default behavior, as
           does placing the function calls within the scope of a "#pragma long_calls_off" directive.  Note these
           switches have no effect on how the compiler generates code to  handle  function  calls  via  function
           pointers.

       <b>-msingle-pic-base</b>
           Treat  the  register used for PIC addressing as read-only, rather than loading it in the prologue for
           each function.  The runtime system is responsible for initializing this register with an  appropriate
           value before execution begins.

       <b>-mpic-register=</b><u>reg</u>
           Specify  the  register to be used for PIC addressing.  For standard PIC base case, the default is any
           suitable register determined by compiler.  For single PIC base case, the default is <b>R9</b> if  target  is
           EABI based or stack-checking is enabled, otherwise the default is <b>R10</b>.

       <b>-mpic-data-is-text-relative</b>
           Assume  that  the displacement between the text and data segments is fixed at static link time.  This
           permits using PC-relative addressing operations to access data known to be in the data segment.   For
           non-VxWorks  RTP  targets, this option is enabled by default.  When disabled on such targets, it will
           enable <b>-msingle-pic-base</b> by default.

       <b>-mpoke-function-name</b>
           Write the name of each function into the text section, directly preceding the function prologue.  The
           generated code is similar to this:

                        t0
                            .ascii "arm_poke_function_name", 0
                            .align
                        t1
                            .word 0xff000000 + (t1 - t0)
                        arm_poke_function_name
                            mov     ip, sp
                            stmfd   sp!, {fp, ip, lr, pc}
                            sub     fp, ip, #4

           When performing a stack backtrace, code can inspect the value of "pc" stored at "fp  +  0".   If  the
           trace  function  then looks at location "pc - 12" and the top 8 bits are set, then we know that there
           is a function name  embedded  immediately  preceding  this  location  and  has  length  "((pc[-3])  &amp;
           0xff000000)".

       <b>-mthumb</b>
       <b>-marm</b>
           Select  between  generating  code  that  executes  in  ARM  and  Thumb  states.  The default for most
           configurations is to generate code that executes in ARM state, but the  default  can  be  changed  by
           configuring GCC with the <b>--with-mode=</b><u>state</u> configure option.

           You  can  also  override  the  ARM  and Thumb mode for each function by using the target("thumb") and
           target("arm") function attributes or pragmas.

       <b>-mflip-thumb</b>
           Switch ARM/Thumb modes on alternating functions.  This option is provided for regression  testing  of
           mixed Thumb/ARM code generation, and is not intended for ordinary use in compiling code.

       <b>-mtpcs-frame</b>
           Generate  a  stack  frame  that  is compliant with the Thumb Procedure Call Standard for all non-leaf
           functions.  (A leaf function is one that  does  not  call  any  other  functions.)   The  default  is
           <b>-mno-tpcs-frame</b>.

       <b>-mtpcs-leaf-frame</b>
           Generate  a  stack  frame  that  is  compliant  with  the  Thumb Procedure Call Standard for all leaf
           functions.  (A leaf function is one that  does  not  call  any  other  functions.)   The  default  is
           <b>-mno-apcs-leaf-frame</b>.

       <b>-mcallee-super-interworking</b>
           Gives all externally visible functions in the file being compiled an ARM instruction set header which
           switches  to Thumb mode before executing the rest of the function.  This allows these functions to be
           called from non-interworking code.   This  option  is  not  valid  in  AAPCS  configurations  because
           interworking is enabled by default.

       <b>-mcaller-super-interworking</b>
           Allows  calls  via function pointers (including virtual functions) to execute correctly regardless of
           whether the target code has been compiled for interworking or not.  There is a small overhead in  the
           cost  of  executing  a function pointer if this option is enabled.  This option is not valid in AAPCS
           configurations because interworking is enabled by default.

       <b>-mtp=</b><u>name</u>
           Specify the access model for the thread local storage pointer.  The  valid  models  are  <b>soft</b>,  which
           generates  calls  to  "__aeabi_read_tp",  <b>cp15</b>, which fetches the thread pointer from "cp15" directly
           (supported in the arm6k architecture), and <b>auto</b>,  which  uses  the  best  available  method  for  the
           selected processor.  The default setting is <b>auto</b>.

       <b>-mtls-dialect=</b><u>dialect</u>
           Specify  the dialect to use for accessing thread local storage.  Two <u>dialect</u>s are supported---<b>gnu</b> and
           <b>gnu2</b>.  The <b>gnu</b> dialect selects the original GNU scheme for supporting local and  global  dynamic  TLS
           models.   The  <b>gnu2</b>  dialect selects the GNU descriptor scheme, which provides better performance for
           shared libraries.  The GNU descriptor scheme is compatible with the original scheme, but does require
           new assembler, linker and library support.  Initial and local exec TLS models are unaffected by  this
           option and always use the original scheme.

       <b>-mword-relocations</b>
           Only  generate  absolute  relocations  on  word-sized  values (i.e. R_ARM_ABS32).  This is enabled by
           default on targets (uClinux, SymbianOS) where the runtime loader imposes this restriction,  and  when
           <b>-fpic</b> or <b>-fPIC</b> is specified. This option conflicts with <b>-mslow-flash-data</b>.

       <b>-mfix-cortex-m3-ldrd</b>
           Some  Cortex-M3 cores can cause data corruption when "ldrd" instructions with overlapping destination
           and base registers are used.  This option avoids  generating  these  instructions.   This  option  is
           enabled by default when <b>-mcpu=cortex-m3</b> is specified.

       <b>-munaligned-access</b>
       <b>-mno-unaligned-access</b>
           Enables  (or  disables) reading and writing of 16- and 32- bit values from addresses that are not 16-
           or 32- bit aligned.  By default unaligned access is disabled for all pre-ARMv6, all ARMv6-M  and  for
           ARMv8-M  Baseline architectures, and enabled for all other architectures.  If unaligned access is not
           enabled then words in packed data structures are accessed a byte at a time.

           The ARM attribute "Tag_CPU_unaligned_access" is set in the generated object file to  either  true  or
           false,  depending  upon  the  setting  of  this  option.   If  unaligned  access  is enabled then the
           preprocessor symbol "__ARM_FEATURE_UNALIGNED" is also defined.

       <b>-mneon-for-64bits</b>
           This option is deprecated and has no effect.

       <b>-mslow-flash-data</b>
           Assume loading data from flash is slower  than  fetching  instruction.   Therefore  literal  load  is
           minimized  for  better performance.  This option is only supported when compiling for ARMv7 M-profile
           and off by default. It conflicts with <b>-mword-relocations</b>.

       <b>-masm-syntax-unified</b>
           Assume inline assembler is using unified asm syntax.  The default  is  currently  off  which  implies
           divided  syntax.  This option has no impact on Thumb2. However, this may change in future releases of
           GCC.  Divided syntax should be considered deprecated.

       <b>-mrestrict-it</b>
           Restricts generation of IT blocks to conform to the rules of ARMv8-A.  IT blocks can only  contain  a
           single 16-bit instruction from a select set of instructions. This option is on by default for ARMv8-A
           Thumb mode.

       <b>-mprint-tune-info</b>
           Print  CPU  tuning  information  as  comment  in  assembler  file.   This  is an option used only for
           regression testing of the compiler and not intended for ordinary use in compiling code.  This  option
           is disabled by default.

       <b>-mverbose-cost-dump</b>
           Enable  verbose  cost  model  dumping  in  the  debug dump files.  This option is provided for use in
           debugging the compiler.

       <b>-mpure-code</b>
           Do not allow constant data to be placed in code  sections.   Additionally,  when  compiling  for  ELF
           object format give all text sections the ELF processor-specific section attribute "SHF_ARM_PURECODE".
           This option is only available when generating non-pic code for M-profile targets.

       <b>-mcmse</b>
           Generate  secure  code  as  per  the  "ARMv8-M Security Extensions: Requirements on Development Tools
           Engineering         Specification",         which          can          be          found          on
           &lt;<b>https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ecm0359818/latest/</b>&gt;.

       <b>-mfix-cmse-cve-2021-35465</b>
           Mitigate  against  a  potential security issue with the "VLLDM" instruction in some M-profile devices
           when using CMSE (CVE-2021-365465).  This option is enabled by default when the option <b>-mcpu=</b> is  used
           with  "cortex-m33",  "cortex-m35p"  or  "cortex-m55".  The option <b>-mno-fix-cmse-cve-2021-35465</b> can be
           used to disable the mitigation.

       <b>-mfdpic</b>
       <b>-mno-fdpic</b>
           Select the FDPIC ABI, which uses 64-bit function descriptors  to  represent  pointers  to  functions.
           When  the  compiler  is configured for "arm-*-uclinuxfdpiceabi" targets, this option is on by default
           and implies <b>-fPIE</b> if none of the PIC/PIE-related options is provided.   On  other  targets,  it  only
           enables  the  FDPIC-specific  code  generation  features,  and the user should explicitly provide the
           PIC/PIE-related options as needed.

           Note that static linking is not supported because it would still involve the dynamic linker when  the
           program self-relocates.  If such behavior is acceptable, use -static and -Wl,-dynamic-linker options.

           The  opposite  <b>-mno-fdpic</b>  option  is  useful (and required) to build the Linux kernel using the same
           ("arm-*-uclinuxfdpiceabi") toolchain as the one used to build the userland programs.

       <u>AVR</u> <u>Options</u>

       These options are defined for AVR implementations:

           Popping the arguments after the function call can be expensive on AVR so that accumulating the  stack

           such a function call.

           This option can lead to reduced code size for functions that perform several calls to functions  that

           and "--with-long-double=" configure options  ("https://gcc.gnu.org/install/configure.html#avr"),  and
           the same applies for the default values of the options.

           the <b>--relax</b> option to the linker's command line.

           Jump relaxing is performed by the linker because jump offsets are not known before code  is  located.
           Therefore,  the  assembler  code  generated  by the compiler is the same, but the instructions in the
           executable may differ from instructions in the assembler code.

           Relaxing must be turned on if linker stubs are needed, see the section on  "EIND"  and  linker  stubs

       <b>-mshort-calls</b>
           Assume that "RJMP" and "RCALL" can target the whole program memory.

           This  option  is  used  internally for multilib selection.  It is not an optimization option, and you
           don't need to set it by hand.

       <b>-msp8</b>
           Treat the stack pointer register as an 8-bit register, i.e. assume the high byte of the stack pointer
           is zero.  In general, you don't need to set this option by hand.

           This option is used internally by the compiler to select and build multilibs for architectures "avr2"
           and "avr25".  These architectures mix devices with and without "SPH".  For  any  setting  other  than
           <b>-mmcu=avr2</b>  or <b>-mmcu=avr25</b> the compiler driver adds or removes this option from the compiler proper's
           command line, because the compiler then knows if the  device  or  architecture  has  an  8-bit  stack
           pointer and thus no "SPH" register or not.

       <b>-mstrict-X</b>
           Use  address  register  "X"  in  a way proposed by the hardware.  This means that "X" is only used in

           Without this option, the "X" register may be used in the same  way  as  "Y"  or  "Z"  which  then  is
           emulated  by  additional instructions.  For example, loading a value with "X+const" addressing with a
           small non-negative "const &lt; 64" to a register <u>Rn</u> is performed as

                   adiw r26, const   ; X += const

       "EIND" and Devices with More Than 128 Ki Bytes of Flash

       Pointers  in  the  implementation are 16 bits wide.  The address of a function or label is represented as
       word address so that indirect jumps and calls can target any code address in the range of 64 Ki words.

       In order to facilitate indirect jump on devices with more than 128 Ki  bytes  of  program  memory  space,
       there  is  a  special  function register called "EIND" that serves as most significant part of the target
       address when "EICALL" or "EIJMP" instructions are used.

       Indirect jumps and calls on these devices are handled as follows by the compiler and are subject to  some
       limitations:

       *   The compiler never sets "EIND".

       *   The compiler uses "EIND" implicitly in "EICALL"/"EIJMP" instructions or might read "EIND" directly in
           order to emulate an indirect call/jump by means of a "RET" instruction.

       *   The  compiler assumes that "EIND" never changes during the startup code or during the application. In
           particular, "EIND" is not saved/restored in function or interrupt service routine prologue/epilogue.

       *   For indirect calls to functions and computed goto, the linker generates <u>stubs</u>. Stubs  are  jump  pads
           sometimes  also  called  <u>trampolines</u>.  Thus,  the  indirect call/jump jumps to such a stub.  The stub
           contains a direct jump to the desired address.

       *   Linker relaxation must be turned on  so  that  the  linker  generates  the  stubs  correctly  in  all
           situations.  See  the  compiler option <b>-mrelax</b> and the linker option <b>--relax</b>.  There are corner cases
           where the linker is supposed to generate stubs but aborts without relaxation and  without  a  helpful
           error message.

       *   The  default  linker  script is arranged for code with "EIND = 0".  If code is supposed to work for a
           setup with "EIND != 0", a custom linker script has to be used in order to place  the  sections  whose
           name start with ".trampolines" into the segment where "EIND" points to.

       *   The  startup  code  from  libgcc never sets "EIND".  Notice that startup code is a blend of code from
           libgcc  and  AVR-LibC.   For  the  impact  of  AVR-LibC  on  "EIND",  see  the   AVR-LibC user manual
           ("<a href="http://nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/">http://nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/</a>").

       *   It  is  legitimate  for  user-specific  startup  code to set up "EIND" early, for example by means of
           initialization code located in section ".init3". Such code runs prior to general  startup  code  that
           initializes  RAM  and  calls  constructors, but after the bit of startup code from AVR-LibC that sets
           "EIND" to the segment where the vector table is located.

                   #include &lt;avr/io.h&gt;

                   static void
                   __attribute__((section(".init3"),naked,used,no_instrument_function))
                   init3_set_eind (void)
                   {
                     __asm volatile ("ldi r24,pm_hh8(__trampolines_start)\n\t"
                                     "out %i0,r24" :: "n" (&amp;EIND) : "r24","memory");
                   }

           The "__trampolines_start" symbol is defined in the linker script.

       *   Stubs are generated automatically by the linker if the following two conditions are met:

           -&lt;The address of a label is taken by means of the "gs" modifier&gt;
               (short for <u>generate</u> <u>stubs</u>) like so:

                       LDI r24, lo8(gs(&lt;func&gt;))
                       LDI r25, hi8(gs(&lt;func&gt;))

           -&lt;The final location of that label is in a code segment&gt;
               <u>outside</u> the segment where the stubs are located.

       *   The compiler emits such "gs" modifiers for code labels in the following situations:

           -&lt;Taking address of a function or code label.&gt;
           -&lt;Computed goto.&gt;
           -&lt;If prologue-save function is used, see <b>-mcall-prologues</b>&gt;
               command-line option.

           -&lt;Switch/case dispatch tables. If you do not want such dispatch&gt;
               tables you can specify the <b>-fno-jump-tables</b> command-line option.

           -&lt;C and C++ constructors/destructors called during startup/shutdown.&gt;
           -&lt;If the tools hit a gs() modifier explained above.&gt;
       *   Jumping to non-symbolic addresses like so is <u>not</u> supported:

                   int main (void)
                   {
                       /* Call function at word address 0x2 */
                       return ((int(*)(void)) 0x2)();
                   }

           Instead, a stub has to be set up, i.e. the function has to be called through a  symbol  ("func_4"  in
           the example):

                   int main (void)
                   {
                       extern int func_4 (void);

                       /* Call function at byte address 0x4 */
                       return func_4();
                   }

           and  the  application be linked with <b>-Wl,--defsym,func_4=0x4</b>.  Alternatively, "func_4" can be defined
           in the linker script.

       Handling of the "RAMPD", "RAMPX", "RAMPY" and "RAMPZ" Special Function Registers

       Some AVR devices support memories larger than the 64 KiB range that can be accessed with 16-bit pointers.
       To access memory locations outside this 64 KiB range, the content of a "RAMP" register is  used  as  high
       part  of  the  address:  The  "X",  "Y",  "Z" address register is concatenated with the "RAMPX", "RAMPY",
       "RAMPZ" special function register, respectively, to get  a  wide  address.  Similarly,  "RAMPD"  is  used
       together with direct addressing.

       *   The startup code initializes the "RAMP" special function registers with zero.

       *   If  a  <b>AVR</b>  <b>Named</b>  <b>Address</b>  <b>Spaces,named</b>  <b>address</b> <b>space</b> other than generic or "__flash" is used, then
           "RAMPZ" is set as needed before the operation.

       *   If the device supports RAM larger than 64 KiB and the compiler needs to change "RAMPZ" to  accomplish
           an operation, "RAMPZ" is reset to zero after the operation.

       *   If  the  device  comes with a specific "RAMP" register, the ISR prologue/epilogue saves/restores that
           SFR and initializes it with zero in case the ISR code might (implicitly) use it.

       *   RAM larger than 64 KiB is not supported by GCC for AVR targets.  If you use inline assembler to  read
           from  locations  outside  the  16-bit  address range and change one of the "RAMP" registers, you must
           reset it to zero after the access.

       AVR Built-in Macros

       GCC defines several built-in macros so that the user code  can  test  for  the  presence  or  absence  of
       features.   Almost  any  of  the  following built-in macros are deduced from device capabilities and thus
       triggered by the <b>-mmcu=</b> command-line option.

       For even more AVR-specific built-in macros see <b>AVR</b> <b>Named</b> <b>Address</b> <b>Spaces</b> and <b>AVR</b> <b>Built-in</b> <b>Functions</b>.

       "__AVR_ARCH__"
           Build-in macro that resolves to a decimal number that identifies the architecture and depends on  the
           <b>-mmcu=</b><u>mcu</u> option.  Possible values are:

           2, 25, 3, 31, 35, 4, 5, 51, 6

           for <u>mcu</u>="avr2", "avr25", "avr3", "avr31", "avr35", "avr4", "avr5", "avr51", "avr6",

           respectively and

           100, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107

           for  <u>mcu</u>="avrtiny",  "avrxmega2",  "avrxmega3",  "avrxmega4",  "avrxmega5", "avrxmega6", "avrxmega7",
           respectively.  If <u>mcu</u> specifies a device, this built-in macro is set accordingly. For  example,  with
           <b>-mmcu=atmega8</b> the macro is defined to 4.

       "__AVR_<u>Device</u>__"
           Setting  <b>-mmcu=</b><u>device</u>  defines  this  built-in  macro  which reflects the device's name. For example,
           <b>-mmcu=atmega8</b>   defines   the   built-in   macro    "__AVR_ATmega8__",    <b>-mmcu=attiny261a</b>    defines
           "__AVR_ATtiny261A__", etc.

           The built-in macros' names follow the scheme "__AVR_<u>Device</u>__" where <u>Device</u> is the device name as from
           the  AVR  user manual. The difference between <u>Device</u> in the built-in macro and <u>device</u> in <b>-mmcu=</b><u>device</u>
           is that the latter is always lowercase.

           If <u>device</u> is not a device but only a core architecture like <b>avr51</b>, this macro is not defined.

       "__AVR_DEVICE_NAME__"
           Setting  <b>-mmcu=</b><u>device</u>  defines  this  built-in  macro  to  the  device's  name.  For  example,   with
           <b>-mmcu=atmega8</b> the macro is defined to "atmega8".

           If <u>device</u> is not a device but only a core architecture like <b>avr51</b>, this macro is not defined.

       "__AVR_XMEGA__"
           The device / architecture belongs to the XMEGA family of devices.

       "__AVR_HAVE_ELPM__"
           The device has the "ELPM" instruction.

       "__AVR_HAVE_ELPMX__"
           The device has the "ELPM R<u>n</u>,Z" and "ELPM R<u>n</u>,Z+" instructions.

       "__AVR_HAVE_MOVW__"
           The device has the "MOVW" instruction to perform 16-bit register-register moves.

       "__AVR_HAVE_LPMX__"
           The device has the "LPM R<u>n</u>,Z" and "LPM R<u>n</u>,Z+" instructions.

       "__AVR_HAVE_MUL__"
           The device has a hardware multiplier.

       "__AVR_HAVE_JMP_CALL__"
           The  device has the "JMP" and "CALL" instructions.  This is the case for devices with more than 8 KiB
           of program memory.

       "__AVR_HAVE_EIJMP_EICALL__"
       "__AVR_3_BYTE_PC__"
           The device has the "EIJMP" and "EICALL" instructions.  This is the case for devices  with  more  than
           128 KiB of program memory.  This also means that the program counter (PC) is 3 bytes wide.

       "__AVR_2_BYTE_PC__"
           The  program counter (PC) is 2 bytes wide. This is the case for devices with up to 128 KiB of program
           memory.

       "__AVR_HAVE_8BIT_SP__"
       "__AVR_HAVE_16BIT_SP__"
           The stack pointer (SP) register is treated as 8-bit respectively 16-bit  register  by  the  compiler.
           The definition of these macros is affected by <b>-mtiny-stack</b>.

       "__AVR_HAVE_SPH__"
       "__AVR_SP8__"
           The  device  has the SPH (high part of stack pointer) special function register or has an 8-bit stack
           pointer, respectively.  The definition of these macros is affected by <b>-mmcu=</b>  and  in  the  cases  of
           <b>-mmcu=avr2</b> and <b>-mmcu=avr25</b> also by <b>-msp8</b>.

       "__AVR_HAVE_RAMPD__"
       "__AVR_HAVE_RAMPX__"
       "__AVR_HAVE_RAMPY__"
       "__AVR_HAVE_RAMPZ__"
           The device has the "RAMPD", "RAMPX", "RAMPY", "RAMPZ" special function register, respectively.

       "__NO_INTERRUPTS__"
           This macro reflects the <b>-mno-interrupts</b> command-line option.

       "__AVR_ERRATA_SKIP__"
       "__AVR_ERRATA_SKIP_JMP_CALL__"
           Some  AVR  devices  (AT90S8515,  ATmega103)  must  not skip 32-bit instructions because of a hardware
           erratum.  Skip instructions are "SBRS", "SBRC", "SBIS", "SBIC" and "CPSE".  The second macro is  only
           defined if "__AVR_HAVE_JMP_CALL__" is also set.

       "__AVR_ISA_RMW__"
           The device has Read-Modify-Write instructions (XCH, LAC, LAS and LAT).

       "__AVR_SFR_OFFSET__=<u>offset</u>"
           Instructions  that  can address I/O special function registers directly like "IN", "OUT", "SBI", etc.
           may use a different address as if addressed by an instruction to access RAM like "LD" or "STS".  This
           offset  depends  on the device architecture and has to be subtracted from the RAM address in order to
           get the respective I/O address.

       "__AVR_SHORT_CALLS__"
           The <b>-mshort-calls</b> command line option is set.

       "__AVR_PM_BASE_ADDRESS__=<u>addr</u>"
           Some devices support reading from flash memory by means of "LD*" instructions.  The flash  memory  is
           seen  in  the  data  address  space  at an offset of "__AVR_PM_BASE_ADDRESS__".  If this macro is not
           defined, this feature is not available.  If defined, the address space is linear and there is no need
           to put ".rodata" into RAM.  This is handled by the default linker description file, and is  currently
           available  for  "avrtiny"  and  "avrxmega3".   Even  more convenient, there is no need to use address
           spaces like "__flash" or features like attribute "progmem" and "pgm_read_*".

       "__WITH_AVRLIBC__"
           The compiler is configured to be used together  with  AVR-Libc.   See  the  <b>--with-avrlibc</b>  configure
           option.

       "__HAVE_DOUBLE_MULTILIB__"
           Defined if <b>-mdouble=</b> acts as a multilib option.

       "__HAVE_DOUBLE32__"
       "__HAVE_DOUBLE64__"
           Defined  if  the compiler supports 32-bit double resp. 64-bit double.  The actual layout is specified
           by option <b>-mdouble=</b>.

       "__DEFAULT_DOUBLE__"
           The size in bits of "double" if <b>-mdouble=</b> is not set.  To test the layout of "double" in  a  program,
           use the built-in macro "__SIZEOF_DOUBLE__".

       "__HAVE_LONG_DOUBLE32__"
       "__HAVE_LONG_DOUBLE64__"
       "__HAVE_LONG_DOUBLE_MULTILIB__"
       "__DEFAULT_LONG_DOUBLE__"
           Same as above, but for "long double" instead of "double".

       "__WITH_DOUBLE_COMPARISON__"
           Reflects         the         "--with-double-comparison={tristate|bool|libf7}"        configure option
           ("https://gcc.gnu.org/install/configure.html#avr") and is defined to 2 or 3.

       "__WITH_LIBF7_LIBGCC__"
       "__WITH_LIBF7_MATH__"
       "__WITH_LIBF7_MATH_SYMBOLS__"
           Reflects           the           "--with-libf7={libgcc|math|math-symbols}"           configure option
           ("https://gcc.gnu.org/install/configure.html#avr").

       <u>Blackfin</u> <u>Options</u>

       <b>-mcpu=</b><u>cpu</u>[<b>-</b><u>sirevision</u>]
           Specifies  the  name  of  the  target Blackfin processor.  Currently, <u>cpu</u> can be one of <b>bf512</b>, <b>bf514</b>,
           <b>bf516</b>, <b>bf518</b>, <b>bf522</b>, <b>bf523</b>, <b>bf524</b>, <b>bf525</b>, <b>bf526</b>, <b>bf527</b>, <b>bf531</b>, <b>bf532</b>,  <b>bf533</b>,  <b>bf534</b>,  <b>bf536</b>,  <b>bf537</b>,
           <b>bf538</b>,  <b>bf539</b>,  <b>bf542</b>,  <b>bf544</b>,  <b>bf547</b>,  <b>bf548</b>,  <b>bf549</b>, <b>bf542m</b>, <b>bf544m</b>, <b>bf547m</b>, <b>bf548m</b>, <b>bf549m</b>, <b>bf561</b>,
           <b>bf592</b>.

           The optional <u>sirevision</u> specifies the  silicon  revision  of  the  target  Blackfin  processor.   Any
           workarounds  available  for  the  targeted  silicon  revision are enabled.  If <u>sirevision</u> is <b>none</b>, no
           workarounds are enabled.  If <u>sirevision</u> is <b>any</b>,  all  workarounds  for  the  targeted  processor  are
           enabled.   The  "__SILICON_REVISION__"  macro  is  defined to two hexadecimal digits representing the
           major and minor numbers in the silicon revision.  If <u>sirevision</u> is <b>none</b>,  the  "__SILICON_REVISION__"
           is  not  defined.  If <u>sirevision</u> is <b>any</b>, the "__SILICON_REVISION__" is defined to be 0xffff.  If this
           optional <u>sirevision</u> is not used, GCC assumes the  latest  known  silicon  revision  of  the  targeted
           Blackfin processor.

           GCC  defines  a  preprocessor  macro  for the specified <u>cpu</u>.  For the <b>bfin-elf</b> toolchain, this option
           causes the hardware BSP provided by libgloss to be linked in if <b>-msim</b> is not given.

           Without this option, <b>bf532</b> is used as the processor by default.

           Note that support for <b>bf561</b> is incomplete.  For <b>bf561</b>, only the preprocessor macro is defined.

       <b>-msim</b>
           Specifies that the program will be run on the simulator.  This causes the simulator BSP  provided  by
           libgloss  to  be  linked  in.   This  option  has  effect only for <b>bfin-elf</b> toolchain.  Certain other
           options, such as <b>-mid-shared-library</b> and <b>-mfdpic</b>, imply <b>-msim</b>.

       <b>-momit-leaf-frame-pointer</b>
           Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for leaf functions.  This avoids the instructions to save,
           set up and restore frame pointers and makes an extra register available in leaf functions.

       <b>-mspecld-anomaly</b>
           When enabled, the compiler ensures that the generated code does not contain speculative  loads  after
           jump instructions. If this option is used, "__WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_LOADS" is defined.

       <b>-mno-specld-anomaly</b>
           Don't generate extra code to prevent speculative loads from occurring.

       <b>-mcsync-anomaly</b>
           When  enabled,  the  compiler  ensures  that  the  generated  code  does  not  contain CSYNC or SSYNC
           instructions   too   soon   after    conditional    branches.     If    this    option    is    used,
           "__WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_SYNCS" is defined.

       <b>-mno-csync-anomaly</b>
           Don't  generate  extra  code  to  prevent CSYNC or SSYNC instructions from occurring too soon after a
           conditional branch.

       <b>-mlow64k</b>
           When enabled, the compiler is free to take advantage of the knowledge that the  entire  program  fits
           into the low 64k of memory.

       <b>-mno-low64k</b>
           Assume that the program is arbitrarily large.  This is the default.

       <b>-mstack-check-l1</b>
           Do stack checking using information placed into L1 scratchpad memory by the uClinux kernel.

       <b>-mid-shared-library</b>
           Generate  code  that supports shared libraries via the library ID method.  This allows for execute in
           place and shared libraries in an environment without virtual memory management.  This option  implies
           <b>-fPIC</b>.  With a <b>bfin-elf</b> target, this option implies <b>-msim</b>.

       <b>-mno-id-shared-library</b>
           Generate code that doesn't assume ID-based shared libraries are being used.  This is the default.

       <b>-mleaf-id-shared-library</b>
           Generate code that supports shared libraries via the library ID method, but assumes that this library
           or  executable  won't  link  against  any other ID shared libraries.  That allows the compiler to use
           faster code for jumps and calls.

       <b>-mno-leaf-id-shared-library</b>
           Do not assume that the code being compiled won't link against any ID shared libraries.   Slower  code
           is generated for jump and call insns.

       <b>-mshared-library-id=n</b>
           Specifies  the  identification  number  of  the ID-based shared library being compiled.  Specifying a
           value of 0 generates more compact code; specifying other values forces the allocation of that  number
           to the current library but is no more space- or time-efficient than omitting this option.

       <b>-msep-data</b>
           Generate  code that allows the data segment to be located in a different area of memory from the text
           segment.  This allows for execute in place in an environment without  virtual  memory  management  by
           eliminating relocations against the text section.

       <b>-mno-sep-data</b>
           Generate code that assumes that the data segment follows the text segment.  This is the default.

       <b>-mlong-calls</b>
       <b>-mno-long-calls</b>
           Tells  the  compiler  to  perform  function calls by first loading the address of the function into a
           register and then performing a subroutine call on this register.  This switch is needed if the target
           function lies outside of the 24-bit addressing range of the offset-based version of  subroutine  call
           instruction.

           This  feature  is  not enabled by default.  Specifying <b>-mno-long-calls</b> restores the default behavior.
           Note these switches have no effect on how the compiler generates code to handle  function  calls  via
           function pointers.

       <b>-mfast-fp</b>
           Link  with  the  fast  floating-point  library.  This library relaxes some of the IEEE floating-point
           standard's rules for checking inputs against Not-a-Number (NAN), in the interest of performance.

       <b>-minline-plt</b>
           Enable inlining of PLT entries in function calls to functions that are not known to bind locally.  It
           has no effect without <b>-mfdpic</b>.

       <b>-mmulticore</b>
           Build a standalone application for multicore Blackfin processors.  This option  causes  proper  start
           files and link scripts supporting multicore to be used, and defines the macro "__BFIN_MULTICORE".  It
           can only be used with <b>-mcpu=bf561</b>[<b>-</b><u>sirevision</u>].

           This  option  can  be  used  with  <b>-mcorea</b>  or  <b>-mcoreb</b>,  which  selects the one-application-per-core
           programming model.  Without <b>-mcorea</b> or <b>-mcoreb</b>, the single-application/dual-core programming model is
           used. In this model, the main function of Core B should be named as "coreb_main".

           If this option is not used, the single-core application programming model is used.

       <b>-mcorea</b>
           Build a  standalone  application  for  Core  A  of  BF561  when  using  the  one-application-per-core
           programming  model.  Proper  start  files  and link scripts are used to support Core A, and the macro
           "__BFIN_COREA" is defined.  This option can only be used in conjunction with <b>-mmulticore</b>.

       <b>-mcoreb</b>
           Build a  standalone  application  for  Core  B  of  BF561  when  using  the  one-application-per-core
           programming  model.  Proper  start  files  and link scripts are used to support Core B, and the macro
           "__BFIN_COREB" is defined. When this option is used, "coreb_main" should be used instead  of  "main".
           This option can only be used in conjunction with <b>-mmulticore</b>.

       <b>-msdram</b>
           Build  a  standalone  application  for SDRAM. Proper start files and link scripts are used to put the
           application into SDRAM, and the macro "__BFIN_SDRAM" is defined.  The loader should initialize  SDRAM
           before loading the application.

       <b>-micplb</b>
           Assume  that ICPLBs are enabled at run time.  This has an effect on certain anomaly workarounds.  For
           Linux targets, the default is to assume ICPLBs are enabled; for standalone applications  the  default
           is off.

       <u>C6X</u> <u>Options</u>

       <b>-march=</b><u>name</u>
           This  specifies  the  name  of the target architecture.  GCC uses this name to determine what kind of
           instructions it can emit when generating assembly code.  Permissible names are:  <b>c62x</b>,  <b>c64x</b>,  <b>c64x+</b>,
           <b>c67x</b>, <b>c67x+</b>, <b>c674x</b>.

       <b>-mbig-endian</b>
           Generate code for a big-endian target.

       <b>-mlittle-endian</b>
           Generate code for a little-endian target.  This is the default.

       <b>-msim</b>
           Choose startup files and linker script suitable for the simulator.

       <b>-msdata=default</b>
           Put  small  global and static data in the ".neardata" section, which is pointed to by register "B14".
           Put small uninitialized global and static data in the  ".bss"  section,  which  is  adjacent  to  the
           ".neardata"  section.   Put  small  read-only  data  into  the  ".rodata" section.  The corresponding
           sections used for large pieces of data are ".fardata", ".far" and ".const".

       <b>-msdata=all</b>
           Put all data, not just small objects, into the sections reserved for small data, and  use  addressing
           relative to the "B14" register to access them.

       <b>-msdata=none</b>
           Make  no  use of the sections reserved for small data, and use absolute addresses to access all data.
           Put all initialized global and static data in the ".fardata" section, and all uninitialized  data  in
           the ".far" section.  Put all constant data into the ".const" section.

       <u>CRIS</u> <u>Options</u>

       These options are defined specifically for the CRIS ports.

       <b>-march=</b><u>architecture-type</u>
       <b>-mcpu=</b><u>architecture-type</u>
           Generate  code  for the specified architecture.  The choices for <u>architecture-type</u> are <b>v3</b>, <b>v8</b> and <b>v10</b>
           for respectively ETRAX 4, ETRAX 100, and ETRAX 100 LX.  Default is <b>v0</b>.

       <b>-mtune=</b><u>architecture-type</u>
           Tune to <u>architecture-type</u> everything applicable about the generated code, except for the ABI and  the
           set   of   available   instructions.    The  choices  for  <u>architecture-type</u>  are  the  same  as  for
           <b>-march=</b><u>architecture-type</u>.

       <b>-mmax-stack-frame=</b><u>n</u>
           Warn when the stack frame of a function exceeds <u>n</u> bytes.

       <b>-metrax4</b>
       <b>-metrax100</b>
           The options <b>-metrax4</b> and <b>-metrax100</b> are synonyms for <b>-march=v3</b> and <b>-march=v8</b> respectively.

       <b>-mmul-bug-workaround</b>
       <b>-mno-mul-bug-workaround</b>
           Work around a bug in the "muls" and "mulu" instructions for CPU models where it applies.  This option
           is active by default.

       <b>-mpdebug</b>
           Enable CRIS-specific verbose debug-related information in the assembly code.  This  option  also  has
           the  effect  of turning off the <b>#NO_APP</b> formatted-code indicator to the assembler at the beginning of
           the assembly file.

       <b>-mcc-init</b>
           Do  not  use  condition-code  results  from  previous  instruction;  always  emit  compare  and  test
           instructions before use of condition codes.

       <b>-mno-side-effects</b>
           Do not emit instructions with side effects in addressing modes other than post-increment.

       <b>-mstack-align</b>
       <b>-mno-stack-align</b>
       <b>-mdata-align</b>
       <b>-mno-data-align</b>
       <b>-mconst-align</b>
       <b>-mno-const-align</b>
           These options (<b>no-</b> options) arrange (eliminate arrangements) for the stack frame, individual data and
           constants  to  be  aligned  for  the  maximum  single data access size for the chosen CPU model.  The
           default is to arrange for 32-bit alignment.  ABI details such as structure layout are not affected by
           these options.

       <b>-m32-bit</b>
       <b>-m16-bit</b>
       <b>-m8-bit</b>
           Similar to the stack- data- and const-align options above, these options  arrange  for  stack  frame,
           writable  data  and  constants  to  all  be  32-bit,  16-bit or 8-bit aligned.  The default is 32-bit
           alignment.

       <b>-mno-prologue-epilogue</b>
       <b>-mprologue-epilogue</b>
           With <b>-mno-prologue-epilogue</b>, the normal function prologue and epilogue which set up the  stack  frame
           are  omitted  and  no  return  instructions  or return sequences are generated in the code.  Use this
           option only together with visual inspection of the compiled code: no warnings or errors are generated
           when call-saved registers must be saved, or storage for local variables needs to be allocated.

       <b>-melf</b>
           Legacy no-op option.

       <b>-sim</b>
           This option arranges to link with input-output functions from a simulator library.  Code, initialized
           data and zero-initialized data are allocated consecutively.

       <b>-sim2</b>
           Like <b>-sim</b>, but pass linker options to locate initialized data at 0x40000000 and zero-initialized data
           at 0x80000000.

       <u>CR16</u> <u>Options</u>

       These options are defined specifically for the CR16 ports.

       <b>-mmac</b>
           Enable the use of multiply-accumulate instructions. Disabled by default.

       <b>-mcr16cplus</b>
       <b>-mcr16c</b>
           Generate code for CR16C or CR16C+ architecture. CR16C+ architecture is default.

       <b>-msim</b>
           Links the library libsim.a which is in compatible with simulator. Applicable to ELF compiler only.

       <b>-mint32</b>
           Choose integer type as 32-bit wide.

       <b>-mbit-ops</b>
           Generates "sbit"/"cbit" instructions for bit manipulations.

       <b>-mdata-model=</b><u>model</u>
           Choose a data model. The choices for <u>model</u> are <b>near</b>, <b>far</b> or <b>medium</b>. <b>medium</b> is default.  However,  <b>far</b>
           is not valid with <b>-mcr16c</b>, as the CR16C architecture does not support the far data model.

       <u>C-SKY</u> <u>Options</u>

       GCC supports these options when compiling for C-SKY V2 processors.

       <b>-march=</b><u>arch</u>
           Specify  the  C-SKY  target architecture.  Valid values for <u>arch</u> are: <b>ck801</b>, <b>ck802</b>, <b>ck803</b>, <b>ck807</b>, and
           <b>ck810</b>.  The default is <b>ck810</b>.

       <b>-mcpu=</b><u>cpu</u>
           Specify the C-SKY target processor.  Valid values for <u>cpu</u> are: <b>ck801</b>, <b>ck801t</b>, <b>ck802</b>, <b>ck802t</b>,  <b>ck802j</b>,
           <b>ck803</b>,  <b>ck803h</b>,  <b>ck803t</b>,  <b>ck803ht</b>,  <b>ck803f</b>,  <b>ck803fh</b>,  <b>ck803e</b>,  <b>ck803eh</b>,  <b>ck803et</b>, <b>ck803eht</b>, <b>ck803ef</b>,
           <b>ck803efh</b>, <b>ck803ft</b>, <b>ck803eft</b>, <b>ck803efht</b>, <b>ck803r1</b>, <b>ck803hr1</b>, <b>ck803tr1</b>, <b>ck803htr1</b>, <b>ck803fr1</b>,  <b>ck803fhr1</b>,
           <b>ck803er1</b>,   <b>ck803ehr1</b>,   <b>ck803etr1</b>,   <b>ck803ehtr1</b>,   <b>ck803efr1</b>,   <b>ck803efhr1</b>,  <b>ck803ftr1</b>,  <b>ck803eftr1</b>,
           <b>ck803efhtr1</b>, <b>ck803s</b>, <b>ck803st</b>, <b>ck803se</b>, <b>ck803sf</b>, <b>ck803sef</b>, <b>ck803seft</b>, <b>ck807e</b>, <b>ck807ef</b>, <b>ck807</b>,  <b>ck807f</b>,
           <b>ck810e</b>,  <b>ck810et</b>,  <b>ck810ef</b>,  <b>ck810eft</b>,  <b>ck810</b>, <b>ck810v</b>, <b>ck810f</b>, <b>ck810t</b>, <b>ck810fv</b>, <b>ck810tv</b>, <b>ck810ft</b>, and
           <b>ck810ftv</b>.

       <b>-mbig-endian</b>
       <b>-EB</b>
       <b>-mlittle-endian</b>
       <b>-EL</b> Select big- or little-endian code.  The default is little-endian.

       <b>-mfloat-abi=</b><u>name</u>
           Specifies which floating-point ABI to use.  Permissible values are: <b>soft</b>, <b>softfp</b> and <b>hard</b>.

           Specifying <b>soft</b> causes GCC to generate output containing library calls for floating-point operations.
           <b>softfp</b> allows the generation of code using hardware floating-point instructions, but still  uses  the
           soft-float  calling conventions.  <b>hard</b> allows generation of floating-point instructions and uses FPU-
           specific calling conventions.

           The default depends on the specific target configuration.  Note that the  hard-float  and  soft-float
           ABIs are not link-compatible; you must compile your entire program with the same ABI, and link with a
           compatible set of libraries.

       <b>-mhard-float</b>
       <b>-msoft-float</b>
           Select hardware or software floating-point implementations.  The default is soft float.

       <b>-mdouble-float</b>
       <b>-mno-double-float</b>
           When  <b>-mhard-float</b>  is  in effect, enable generation of double-precision float instructions.  This is
           the default except when compiling for CK803.

       <b>-mfdivdu</b>
       <b>-mno-fdivdu</b>
           When <b>-mhard-float</b> is in effect, enable generation of "frecipd", "fsqrtd", and  "fdivd"  instructions.
           This is the default except when compiling for CK803.

       <b>-mfpu=</b><u>fpu</u>
           Select the floating-point processor.  This option can only be used with <b>-mhard-float</b>.  Values for <u>fpu</u>
           are  <b>fpv2_sf</b>  (equivalent  to  <b>-mno-double-float</b>  <b>-mno-fdivdu</b>), <b>fpv2</b> (<b>-mdouble-float</b> <b>-mno-divdu</b>), and
           <b>fpv2_divd</b> (<b>-mdouble-float</b> <b>-mdivdu</b>).

       <b>-melrw</b>
       <b>-mno-elrw</b>
           Enable the extended "lrw" instruction.  This option defaults to on for CK801 and off otherwise.

       <b>-mistack</b>
       <b>-mno-istack</b>
           Enable interrupt stack instructions; the default is off.

           The <b>-mistack</b> option is required to handle the "interrupt" and "isr" function attributes.

       <b>-mmp</b>
           Enable multiprocessor instructions; the default is off.

       <b>-mcp</b>
           Enable coprocessor instructions; the default is off.

       <b>-mcache</b>
           Enable coprocessor instructions; the default is off.

       <b>-msecurity</b>
           Enable C-SKY security instructions; the default is off.

       <b>-mtrust</b>
           Enable C-SKY trust instructions; the default is off.

       <b>-mdsp</b>
       <b>-medsp</b>
       <b>-mvdsp</b>
           Enable C-SKY DSP, Enhanced DSP, or Vector DSP  instructions,  respectively.   All  of  these  options
           default to off.

       <b>-mdiv</b>
       <b>-mno-div</b>
           Generate divide instructions.  Default is off.

       <b>-msmart</b>
       <b>-mno-smart</b>
           Generate  code for Smart Mode, using only registers numbered 0-7 to allow use of 16-bit instructions.
           This option is ignored for CK801 where this is the required behavior,  and  it  defaults  to  on  for
           CK802.  For other targets, the default is off.

       <b>-mhigh-registers</b>
       <b>-mno-high-registers</b>
           Generate code using the high registers numbered 16-31.  This option is not supported on CK801, CK802,
           or CK803, and is enabled by default for other processors.

       <b>-manchor</b>
       <b>-mno-anchor</b>
           Generate code using global anchor symbol addresses.

       <b>-mpushpop</b>
       <b>-mno-pushpop</b>
           Generate code using "push" and "pop" instructions.  This option defaults to on.

       <b>-mmultiple-stld</b>
       <b>-mstm</b>
       <b>-mno-multiple-stld</b>
       <b>-mno-stm</b>
           Generate  code  using  "stm"  and  "ldm"  instructions.   This option isn't supported on CK801 but is
           enabled by default on other processors.

       <b>-mconstpool</b>
       <b>-mno-constpool</b>
           Create constant pools in the compiler instead of deferring it to the assembler.  This option  is  the
           default  and  required  for  correct  code  generation  on  CK801 and CK802, and is optional on other
           processors.

       <b>-mstack-size</b>
       <b>-mno-stack-size</b>
           Emit ".stack_size" directives for each function in the assembly output.  This option defaults to off.

       <b>-mccrt</b>
       <b>-mno-ccrt</b>
           Generate code for the C-SKY compiler runtime instead of libgcc.  This option defaults to off.

       <b>-mbranch-cost=</b><u>n</u>
           Set the branch costs to roughly "n" instructions.  The default is 1.

       <b>-msched-prolog</b>
       <b>-mno-sched-prolog</b>
           Permit scheduling of function prologue and epilogue sequences.  Using this option can result in  code
           that  is  not  compliant  with  the C-SKY V2 ABI prologue requirements and that cannot be debugged or
           backtraced.  It is disabled by default.

       <b>-msim</b>
           Links the library libsemi.a which is in compatible with simulator. Applicable to ELF compiler only.

       <u>Darwin</u> <u>Options</u>

       These options are defined for all architectures running the Darwin operating system.

       FSF GCC on Darwin does not create  "fat"  object  files;  it  creates  an  object  file  for  the  single
       architecture  that  GCC  was  built to target.  Apple's GCC on Darwin does create "fat" files if multiple
       <b>-arch</b> options are used; it does so by running the compiler or  linker  multiple  times  and  joining  the
       results together with <u>lipo</u>.

       The  subtype of the file created (like <b>ppc7400</b> or <b>ppc970</b> or <b>i686</b>) is determined by the flags that specify
       the ISA that GCC is targeting, like <b>-mcpu</b> or <b>-march</b>.  The <b>-force_cpusubtype_ALL</b> option  can  be  used  to
       override this.

       The  Darwin  tools  vary  in their behavior when presented with an ISA mismatch.  The assembler, <u>as</u>, only
       permits instructions to be used that are valid for the subtype of the  file  it  is  generating,  so  you
       cannot   put   64-bit   instructions  in  a  <b>ppc750</b>  object  file.   The  linker  for  shared  libraries,
       <u>/usr/bin/libtool</u>, fails and prints an error if asked to create a shared library with a  less  restrictive
       subtype  than  its  input  files (for instance, trying to put a <b>ppc970</b> object file in a <b>ppc7400</b> library).
       The linker for executables, <b>ld</b>, quietly gives the executable the most restrictive subtype of any  of  its
       input files.

       <b>-F</b><u>dir</u>
           Add  the  framework  directory  <u>dir</u>  to the head of the list of directories to be searched for header
           files.  These directories are interleaved with those specified by <b>-I</b> options and  are  scanned  in  a
           left-to-right order.

           A  framework  directory  is  a  directory  with  frameworks in it.  A framework is a directory with a
           <u>Headers</u> and/or <u>PrivateHeaders</u> directory contained directly in it that ends in <u>.framework</u>.   The  name
           of  a  framework is the name of this directory excluding the <u>.framework</u>.  Headers associated with the
           framework are found in  one  of  those  two  directories,  with  <u>Headers</u>  being  searched  first.   A
           subframework  is  a  framework  directory that is in a framework's <u>Frameworks</u> directory.  Includes of
           subframework headers can only appear in a header of a framework that contains the subframework, or in
           a sibling subframework header.  Two subframeworks are siblings if they occur in the  same  framework.
           A subframework should not have the same name as a framework; a warning is issued if this is violated.
           Currently  a  subframework cannot have subframeworks; in the future, the mechanism may be extended to
           support  this.   The  standard  frameworks   can   be   found   in   <u>/System/Library/Frameworks</u>   and
           <u>/Library/Frameworks</u>.   An example include looks like "#include &lt;Framework/header.h&gt;", where <u>Framework</u>
           denotes the name of the framework and <u>header.h</u> is found in the <u>PrivateHeaders</u> or <u>Headers</u> directory.

       <b>-iframework</b><u>dir</u>
           Like <b>-F</b> except the directory is a treated as a system directory.  The main  difference  between  this
           <b>-iframework</b>  and  <b>-F</b>  is  that with <b>-iframework</b> the compiler does not warn about constructs contained
           within header files found via <u>dir</u>.  This option is valid only for the C family of languages.

       <b>-gused</b>
           Emit debugging information for symbols that are used.   For  stabs  debugging  format,  this  enables
           <b>-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols</b>.  This is by default ON.

       <b>-gfull</b>
           Emit debugging information for all symbols and types.

       <b>-fconstant-cfstrings</b>
           The <b>-fconstant-cfstrings</b> is an alias for <b>-mconstant-cfstrings</b>.

       <b>-mconstant-cfstrings</b>
           When   the   NeXT   runtime   is   being   used   (the   default  on  these  systems),  override  any
           <b>-fconstant-string-class</b>  setting  and  cause  "@"...""   literals  to  be  laid   out   as   constant
           CoreFoundation strings.

       <b>-mmacosx-version-min=</b><u>version</u>
           The  earliest  version  of  MacOS  X  that  this  executable  will run on is <u>version</u>.  Typical values
           supported for <u>version</u> include 12, 10.12, and 10.5.8.

           If the compiler was built to use the system's headers by default, then the default for this option is
           the system version on which the compiler is running, otherwise the default is to  make  choices  that
           are compatible with as many systems and code bases as possible.

       <b>-mkernel</b>
           Enable  kernel development mode.  The <b>-mkernel</b> option sets <b>-static</b>, <b>-fno-common</b>, <b>-fno-use-cxa-atexit</b>,
           <b>-fno-exceptions</b>, <b>-fno-non-call-exceptions</b>, <b>-fapple-kext</b>, <b>-fno-weak</b> and  <b>-fno-rtti</b>  where  applicable.
           This mode also sets <b>-mno-altivec</b>, <b>-msoft-float</b>, <b>-fno-builtin</b> and <b>-mlong-branch</b> for PowerPC targets.

       <b>-mone-byte-bool</b>
           Override  the  defaults  for  "bool"  so  that  "sizeof(bool)==1".  By default sizeof(bool) is 4 when
           compiling for Darwin/PowerPC and 1 when compiling for Darwin/x86, so this option  has  no  effect  on
           x86.

           <b>Warning:</b>  The  <b>-mone-byte-bool</b>  switch causes GCC to generate code that is not binary compatible with
           code generated without that switch.  Using this switch may require recompiling all other modules in a
           program, including system libraries.  Use this switch to conform to a non-default data model.

       <b>-mfix-and-continue</b>
       <b>-ffix-and-continue</b>
       <b>-findirect-data</b>
           Generate code suitable for fast turnaround development, such as to allow GDB to dynamically  load  <u>.o</u>
           files  into  already-running  programs.   <b>-findirect-data</b>  and  <b>-ffix-and-continue</b>  are  provided for
           backwards compatibility.

       <b>-all_load</b>
           Loads all members of static archive libraries.  See man <b><a href="../man1/ld.1.html">ld</a></b>(1) for more information.

       <b>-arch_errors_fatal</b>
           Cause the errors having to do with files that have the wrong architecture to be fatal.

       <b>-bind_at_load</b>
           Causes the output file to be marked such that the dynamic linker will bind all  undefined  references
           when the file is loaded or launched.

       <b>-bundle</b>
           Produce a Mach-o bundle format file.  See man <b><a href="../man1/ld.1.html">ld</a></b>(1) for more information.

       <b>-bundle_loader</b> <u>executable</u>
           This  option  specifies  the  <u>executable</u>  that will load the build output file being linked.  See man
           <b><a href="../man1/ld.1.html">ld</a></b>(1) for more information.

       <b>-dynamiclib</b>
           When passed this option, GCC produces a dynamic library instead of an executable when linking,  using
           the Darwin <u>libtool</u> command.

       <b>-force_cpusubtype_ALL</b>
           This  causes  GCC's  output  file  to have the <b>ALL</b> subtype, instead of one controlled by the <b>-mcpu</b> or
           <b>-march</b> option.

       These <b>-m</b> options are defined for the DEC Alpha implementations:

       <b>-mno-soft-float</b>
       <b>-msoft-float</b>
           Use (do not use) the  hardware  floating-point  instructions  for  floating-point  operations.   When
           <b>-msoft-float</b>  is  specified,  functions  in  <u>libgcc.a</u>  are used to perform floating-point operations.
           Unless they are replaced by routines that emulate the floating-point operations, or compiled in  such
           a  way  as to call such emulations routines, these routines issue floating-point operations.   If you
           are compiling for an Alpha without floating-point operations, you must ensure  that  the  library  is
           built so as not to call them.

           Note that Alpha implementations without floating-point operations are required to have floating-point
           registers.

       <b>-mfp-reg</b>
       <b>-mno-fp-regs</b>
           Generate  code  that  uses  (does  not  use)  the  floating-point register set.  <b>-mno-fp-regs</b> implies
           <b>-msoft-float</b>.  If the floating-point register set is not used, floating-point operands are passed  in
           integer  registers  as  if  they were integers and floating-point results are passed in $0 instead of
           $f0.  This is a non-standard calling sequence, so any function  with  a  floating-point  argument  or
           return value called by code compiled with <b>-mno-fp-regs</b> must also be compiled with that option.

           A  typical  use  of  this  option is building a kernel that does not use, and hence need not save and
           restore, any floating-point registers.

       <b>-mieee</b>
           The Alpha architecture implements floating-point hardware optimized for maximum performance.   It  is
           mostly  compliant  with  the  IEEE  floating-point  standard.  However, for full compliance, software
           assistance is required.  This option  generates  code  fully  IEEE-compliant  code  <u>except</u>  that  the
           <u>inexact-flag</u>  is  not  maintained  (see  below).  If this option is turned on, the preprocessor macro
           "_IEEE_FP" is defined during compilation.  The resulting code  is  less  efficient  but  is  able  to
           correctly  support  denormalized  numbers  and  exceptional  IEEE  values  such  as  not-a-number and
           plus/minus infinity.  Other Alpha compilers call this option <b>-ieee_with_no_inexact</b>.

       <b>-mieee-with-inexact</b>
           This is like <b>-mieee</b> except the generated code also maintains the IEEE <u>inexact-flag</u>.  Turning on  this
           option  causes the generated code to implement fully-compliant IEEE math.  In addition to "_IEEE_FP",
           "_IEEE_FP_EXACT" is defined as a preprocessor macro.  On some  Alpha  implementations  the  resulting
           code may execute significantly slower than the code generated by default.  Since there is very little
           code  that  depends  on  the  <u>inexact-flag</u>, you should normally not specify this option.  Other Alpha
           compilers call this option <b>-ieee_with_inexact</b>.

       <b>-mfp-trap-mode=</b><u>trap-mode</u>
           This option controls what floating-point related traps are enabled.  Other Alpha compilers call  this
           option <b>-fptm</b> <u>trap-mode</u>.  The trap mode can be set to one of four values:

           <b>n</b>   This  is  the default (normal) setting.  The only traps that are enabled are the ones that cannot
               be disabled in software (e.g., division by zero trap).

           <b>u</b>   In addition to the traps enabled by <b>n</b>, underflow traps are enabled as well.

           <b>su</b>  Like <b>u</b>, but  the  instructions  are  marked  to  be  safe  for  software  completion  (see  Alpha
               architecture manual for details).

           <b>sui</b> Like <b>su</b>, but inexact traps are enabled as well.

       <b>-mfp-rounding-mode=</b><u>rounding-mode</u>
           Selects  the  IEEE  rounding  mode.  Other Alpha compilers call this option <b>-fprm</b> <u>rounding-mode</u>.  The
           <u>rounding-mode</u> can be one of:

           <b>n</b>   Normal IEEE rounding mode.  Floating-point numbers are rounded towards the nearest machine number
               or towards the even machine number in case of a tie.

           <b>m</b>   Round towards minus infinity.

           <b>c</b>   Chopped rounding mode.  Floating-point numbers are rounded towards zero.

           <b>d</b>   Dynamic rounding mode.   A  field  in  the  floating-point  control  register  (<u>fpcr</u>,  see  Alpha
               architecture  reference  manual) controls the rounding mode in effect.  The C library initializes
               this register for rounding towards plus infinity.  Thus, unless your program modifies the <u>fpcr</u>, <b>d</b>
               corresponds to round towards plus infinity.

       <b>-mtrap-precision=</b><u>trap-precision</u>
           In the  Alpha  architecture,  floating-point  traps  are  imprecise.   This  means  without  software
           assistance  it  is impossible to recover from a floating trap and program execution normally needs to
           be terminated.  GCC can generate code that can assist operating system trap handlers  in  determining
           the  exact  location  that  caused  a  floating-point  trap.   Depending  on  the  requirements of an
           application, different levels of precisions can be selected:

           <b>p</b>   Program precision.  This option is the default and means a trap handler can only  identify  which
               program caused a floating-point exception.

           <b>f</b>   Function  precision.   The  trap  handler can determine the function that caused a floating-point
               exception.

           <b>i</b>   Instruction precision.  The trap handler can  determine  the  exact  instruction  that  caused  a
               floating-point exception.

           Other Alpha compilers provide the equivalent options called <b>-scope_safe</b> and <b>-resumption_safe</b>.

       <b>-mieee-conformant</b>
           This  option  marks  the  generated code as IEEE conformant.  You must not use this option unless you
           also specify <b>-mtrap-precision=i</b> and either <b>-mfp-trap-mode=su</b> or <b>-mfp-trap-mode=sui</b>.  Its only  effect
           is to emit the line <b>.eflag</b> <b>48</b> in the function prologue of the generated assembly file.

       <b>-mbuild-constants</b>
           Normally  GCC  examines  a  32- or 64-bit integer constant to see if it can construct it from smaller
           constants in two or three instructions.  If it cannot, it outputs  the  constant  as  a  literal  and
           generates code to load it from the data segment at run time.

           Use  this  option to require GCC to construct <u>all</u> integer constants using code, even if it takes more
           instructions (the maximum is six).

           You typically use this option to build a shared library dynamic loader.  Itself a shared library,  it
           must  relocate  itself  in  memory  before  it  can  find the variables and constants in its own data
           segment.

       <b>-mbwx</b>
       <b>-mno-bwx</b>
       <b>-mcix</b>
       <b>-mno-cix</b>
       <b>-mfix</b>
       <b>-mno-fix</b>
       <b>-mmax</b>
       <b>-mno-max</b>
           Indicate whether GCC should generate code to use the optional BWX, CIX, FIX and MAX instruction sets.
           The default is to use the instruction sets supported by the CPU type specified via <b>-mcpu=</b>  option  or
           that of the CPU on which GCC was built if none is specified.

       <b>-mfloat-vax</b>
       <b>-mfloat-ieee</b>
           Generate  code  that uses (does not use) VAX F and G floating-point arithmetic instead of IEEE single
           and double precision.

       <b>-mexplicit-relocs</b>
       <b>-mno-explicit-relocs</b>
           Older Alpha assemblers provided no way to generate symbol relocations except  via  assembler  macros.
           Use  of  these macros does not allow optimal instruction scheduling.  GNU binutils as of version 2.12
           supports a new syntax that allows the compiler to explicitly mark which relocations should  apply  to
           which  instructions.   This option is mostly useful for debugging, as GCC detects the capabilities of
           the assembler when it is built and sets the default accordingly.

       <b>-msmall-data</b>
       <b>-mlarge-data</b>
           When <b>-mexplicit-relocs</b> is in effect, static data  is  accessed  via  <u>gp-relative</u>  relocations.   When
           <b>-msmall-data</b>  is  used, objects 8 bytes long or smaller are placed in a <u>small</u> <u>data</u> <u>area</u> (the ".sdata"
           and ".sbss" sections) and are accessed via 16-bit relocations off of the $gp register.   This  limits
           the  size  of  the  small  data  area to 64KB, but allows the variables to be directly accessed via a
           single instruction.

           The default is <b>-mlarge-data</b>.  With this option the data area is limited to just below 2GB.   Programs
           that  require  more  than  2GB  of  data must use "malloc" or "mmap" to allocate the data in the heap
           instead of in the program's data segment.

           When generating code for shared libraries, <b>-fpic</b> implies <b>-msmall-data</b> and <b>-fPIC</b> implies <b>-mlarge-data</b>.

       <b>-msmall-text</b>
       <b>-mlarge-text</b>
           When <b>-msmall-text</b> is used, the compiler assumes that the  code  of  the  entire  program  (or  shared
           library)  fits  in  4MB, and is thus reachable with a branch instruction.  When <b>-msmall-data</b> is used,
           the compiler can assume that all local symbols share the same $gp value, and thus reduce  the  number
           of instructions required for a function call from 4 to 1.

           The default is <b>-mlarge-text</b>.

       <b>-mcpu=</b><u>cpu_type</u>
           Set  the  instruction  set  and instruction scheduling parameters for machine type <u>cpu_type</u>.  You can
           specify either the <b>EV</b>  style  name  or  the  corresponding  chip  number.   GCC  supports  scheduling
           parameters  for  the  EV4,  EV5  and  EV6 family of processors and chooses the default values for the
           instruction set from the processor you specify.  If you do not specify a processor type, GCC defaults
           to the processor on which the compiler was built.

           Supported values for <u>cpu_type</u> are

           <b>ev4</b>
           <b>ev45</b>
           <b>21064</b>
               Schedules as an EV4 and has no instruction set extensions.

           <b>ev5</b>
           <b>21164</b>
               Schedules as an EV5 and has no instruction set extensions.

           <b>ev56</b>
           <b>21164a</b>
               Schedules as an EV5 and supports the BWX extension.

           <b>pca56</b>
           <b>21164pc</b>
           <b>21164PC</b>
               Schedules as an EV5 and supports the BWX and MAX extensions.

           <b>ev6</b>
           <b>21264</b>
               Schedules as an EV6 and supports the BWX, FIX, and MAX extensions.

           <b>ev67</b>
           <b>21264a</b>
               Schedules as an EV6 and supports the BWX, CIX, FIX, and MAX extensions.

           Native toolchains also support the value <b>native</b>, which selects the best architecture option  for  the
           host processor.  <b>-mcpu=native</b> has no effect if GCC does not recognize the processor.

       <b>-mtune=</b><u>cpu_type</u>
           Set only the instruction scheduling parameters for machine type <u>cpu_type</u>.  The instruction set is not
           changed.

           Native  toolchains  also support the value <b>native</b>, which selects the best architecture option for the
           host processor.  <b>-mtune=native</b> has no effect if GCC does not recognize the processor.

       <b>-mmemory-latency=</b><u>time</u>
           Sets the latency  the  scheduler  should  assume  for  typical  memory  references  as  seen  by  the
           application.   This  number is highly dependent on the memory access patterns used by the application
           and the size of the external cache on the machine.

           Valid options for <u>time</u> are

           <u>number</u>
               A decimal number representing clock cycles.

           <b>L1</b>
           <b>L2</b>
           <b>L3</b>
           <b>main</b>
               The compiler contains estimates of the number of clock cycles for "typical" EV4  &amp;  EV5  hardware
               for  the  Level  1,  2  &amp;  3  caches (also called Dcache, Scache, and Bcache), as well as to main
               memory.  Note that L3 is only valid for EV5.

       <u>eBPF</u> <u>Options</u>

       <b>-mframe-limit=</b><u>bytes</u>
           This specifies the hard limit for frame sizes, in bytes.  Currently, the value that can be  specified
           should  be  less than or equal to <b>32767</b>.  Defaults to whatever limit is imposed by the version of the
           Linux kernel targeted.

       <b>-mkernel=</b><u>version</u>
           This specifies the minimum version of the kernel that will run the compiled program.  GCC  uses  this
           version  to  determine  which  instructions  to  use,  what kernel helpers to allow, etc.  Currently,
           <u>version</u> can be one of <b>4.0</b>, <b>4.1</b>, <b>4.2</b>, <b>4.3</b>, <b>4.4</b>, <b>4.5</b>, <b>4.6</b>, <b>4.7</b>, <b>4.8</b>, <b>4.9</b>, <b>4.10</b>, <b>4.11</b>, <b>4.12</b>, <b>4.13</b>, <b>4.14</b>,
           <b>4.15</b>, <b>4.16</b>, <b>4.17</b>, <b>4.18</b>, <b>4.19</b>, <b>4.20</b>, <b>5.0</b>, <b>5.1</b>, <b>5.2</b>, <b>latest</b> and <b>native</b>.

       <b>-mbig-endian</b>
           Generate code for a big-endian target.

       <b>-mlittle-endian</b>
           Generate code for a little-endian target.  This is the default.

       <b>-mxbpf</b>
           Generate code for an expanded version of BPF, which relaxes some of the restrictions imposed  by  the
           BPF architecture:

           -&lt;Save and restore callee-saved registers at function entry and&gt;
               exit, respectively.

       <u>FR30</u> <u>Options</u>

       These options are defined specifically for the FR30 port.

       <b>-msmall-model</b>
           Use  the  small  address  space  model.   This  can produce smaller code, but it does assume that all
           symbolic values and addresses fit into a 20-bit range.

       <b>-mno-lsim</b>
           Assume that runtime support has been provided and so there  is  no  need  to  include  the  simulator
           library (<u>libsim.a</u>) on the linker command line.

       <u>FT32</u> <u>Options</u>

       These options are defined specifically for the FT32 port.

       <b>-msim</b>
           Specifies  that  the  program will be run on the simulator.  This causes an alternate runtime startup
           and library to be linked.  You must not use this option when generating programs  that  will  run  on
           real hardware; you must provide your own runtime library for whatever I/O functions are needed.

       <b>-mlra</b>
           Enable  Local  Register  Allocation.  This is still experimental for FT32, so by default the compiler
           uses standard reload.

       <b>-mnodiv</b>
           Do not use div and mod instructions.

       <b>-mft32b</b>
           Enable use of the extended instructions of the FT32B processor.

       <b>-mcompress</b>
           Compress all code using the Ft32B code compression scheme.

       <b>-mnopm</b>
           Do not generate code that reads program memory.

       <u>FRV</u> <u>Options</u>

       <b>-mgpr-32</b>
           Only use the first 32 general-purpose registers.

       <b>-mgpr-64</b>
           Use all 64 general-purpose registers.

       <b>-mfpr-32</b>
           Use only the first 32 floating-point registers.

       <b>-mfpr-64</b>
           Use all 64 floating-point registers.

       <b>-mhard-float</b>
           Use hardware instructions for floating-point operations.

       <b>-msoft-float</b>
           Use library routines for floating-point operations.

       <b>-malloc-cc</b>
           Dynamically allocate condition code registers.

       <b>-mfixed-cc</b>
           Do not try to dynamically allocate condition code registers, only use "icc0" and "fcc0".

       <b>-mdword</b>
           Change ABI to use double word insns.

       <b>-mno-dword</b>
           Do not use double word instructions.

       <b>-mdouble</b>
           Use floating-point double instructions.

       <b>-mno-double</b>
           Do not use floating-point double instructions.

       <b>-mmedia</b>
           Use media instructions.

       <b>-mno-media</b>
           Do not use media instructions.

       <b>-mmuladd</b>
           Use multiply and add/subtract instructions.

       <b>-mno-muladd</b>
           Do not use multiply and add/subtract instructions.

       <b>-mfdpic</b>
           Select the FDPIC ABI, which uses function descriptors to represent pointers  to  functions.   Without
           any PIC/PIE-related options, it implies <b>-fPIE</b>.  With <b>-fpic</b> or <b>-fpie</b>, it assumes GOT entries and small
           data  are  within  a  12-bit  range  from  the GOT base address; with <b>-fPIC</b> or <b>-fPIE</b>, GOT offsets are
           computed with 32 bits.  With a <b>bfin-elf</b> target, this option implies <b>-msim</b>.

       <b>-minline-plt</b>
           Enable inlining of PLT entries in function calls to functions that are not known to bind locally.  It
           has no effect without <b>-mfdpic</b>.  It's enabled by default if optimizing for  speed  and  compiling  for
           shared  libraries  (i.e.,  <b>-fPIC</b>  or  <b>-fpic</b>),  or when an optimization option such as <b>-O3</b> or above is
           present in the command line.

       <b>-mTLS</b>
           Assume a large TLS segment when generating thread-local code.

       <b>-mtls</b>
           Do not assume a large TLS segment when generating thread-local code.

       <b>-mgprel-ro</b>
           Enable the use of "GPREL" relocations in the FDPIC ABI for data that is  known  to  be  in  read-only
           sections.   It's  enabled  by  default,  except  for <b>-fpic</b> or <b>-fpie</b>: even though it may help make the
           global offset table smaller, it trades 1 instruction for  4.   With  <b>-fPIC</b>  or  <b>-fPIE</b>,  it  trades  3
           instructions  for 4, one of which may be shared by multiple symbols, and it avoids the need for a GOT
           entry for the referenced symbol, so it's more likely to be a win.  If it is not, <b>-mno-gprel-ro</b> can be
           used to disable it.

       <b>-multilib-library-pic</b>
           Link with the (library, not FD) pic libraries.  It's implied by <b>-mlibrary-pic</b>, as well  as  by  <b>-fPIC</b>
           and <b>-fpic</b> without <b>-mfdpic</b>.  You should never have to use it explicitly.

       <b>-mlinked-fp</b>
           Follow  the  EABI requirement of always creating a frame pointer whenever a stack frame is allocated.
           This option is enabled by default and can be disabled with <b>-mno-linked-fp</b>.

       <b>-mlong-calls</b>
           Use indirect addressing to call functions outside the current  compilation  unit.   This  allows  the
           functions to be placed anywhere within the 32-bit address space.

       <b>-malign-labels</b>
           Try  to  align  labels to an 8-byte boundary by inserting NOPs into the previous packet.  This option
           only has an effect when VLIW packing is enabled.  It doesn't create new packets; it merely adds  NOPs
           to existing ones.

       <b>-mlibrary-pic</b>
           Generate position-independent EABI code.

       <b>-macc-4</b>
           Use only the first four media accumulator registers.

       <b>-macc-8</b>
           Use all eight media accumulator registers.

       <b>-mpack</b>
           Pack VLIW instructions.

       <b>-mno-pack</b>
           Do not pack VLIW instructions.

       <b>-mno-eflags</b>
           Do not mark ABI switches in e_flags.

       <b>-mcond-move</b>
           Enable the use of conditional-move instructions (default).

           This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and will likely be removed in a future version.

       <b>-mno-cond-move</b>
           Disable the use of conditional-move instructions.

           This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and will likely be removed in a future version.

       <b>-mscc</b>
           Enable the use of conditional set instructions (default).

       <b>-mno-vliw-branch</b>
           Do not run a pass to pack branches into VLIW instructions.

           This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and will likely be removed in a future version.

       <b>-mmulti-cond-exec</b>
           Enable optimization of "&amp;&amp;" and "||" in conditional execution (default).

           This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and will likely be removed in a future version.

       <b>-mno-multi-cond-exec</b>
           Disable optimization of "&amp;&amp;" and "||" in conditional execution.

           This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and will likely be removed in a future version.

       <b>-mnested-cond-exec</b>
           Enable nested conditional execution optimizations (default).

           This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and will likely be removed in a future version.

           Disable nested conditional execution optimizations.

           This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and will likely be removed in a future version.

       <b>-moptimize-membar</b>
           This  switch removes redundant "membar" instructions from the compiler-generated code.  It is enabled
           by default.

       <b>-mno-optimize-membar</b>
           This switch disables the automatic removal of redundant  "membar"  instructions  from  the  generated
           code.

       <b>-mtomcat-stats</b>
           Cause gas to print out tomcat statistics.

       <b>-mcpu=</b><u>cpu</u>
           Select the processor type for which to generate code.  Possible values are <b>frv</b>, <b>fr550</b>, <b>tomcat</b>, <b>fr500</b>,
           <b>fr450</b>, <b>fr405</b>, <b>fr400</b>, <b>fr300</b> and <b>simple</b>.

       <u>GNU/Linux</u> <u>Options</u>

       These <b>-m</b> options are defined for GNU/Linux targets:

       <b>-mglibc</b>
           Use  the  GNU  C  library.   This  is  the default except on <b>*-*-linux-*uclibc*</b>, <b>*-*-linux-*musl*</b> and
           <b>*-*-linux-*android*</b> targets.

       <b>-muclibc</b>
           Use uClibc C library.  This is the default on <b>*-*-linux-*uclibc*</b> targets.

       <b>-mmusl</b>
           Use the musl C library.  This is the default on <b>*-*-linux-*musl*</b> targets.

       <b>-mbionic</b>
           Use Bionic C library.  This is the default on <b>*-*-linux-*android*</b> targets.

       <b>-mandroid</b>
           Compile code compatible with Android platform.  This is the default on <b>*-*-linux-*android*</b> targets.

           When compiling, this option enables <b>-mbionic</b>, <b>-fPIC</b>, <b>-fno-exceptions</b> and <b>-fno-rtti</b> by default.   When
           linking, this option makes the GCC driver pass Android-specific options to the linker.  Finally, this
           option causes the preprocessor macro "__ANDROID__" to be defined.

       <b>-tno-android-cc</b>
           Disable  compilation  effects  of <b>-mandroid</b>, i.e., do not enable <b>-mbionic</b>, <b>-fPIC</b>, <b>-fno-exceptions</b> and
           <b>-fno-rtti</b> by default.

       <b>-tno-android-ld</b>
           Disable linking effects of <b>-mandroid</b>, i.e., pass standard Linux linking options to the linker.

       <u>H8/300</u> <u>Options</u>

       These <b>-m</b> options are defined for the H8/300 implementations:

       <b>-mrelax</b>
           Shorten some address references at link time, when possible; uses the linker option <b>-relax</b>.

       <b>-mh</b> Generate code for the H8/300H.

       <b>-ms</b> Generate code for the H8S.

       <b>-mn</b> Generate code for the H8S and H8/300H in the normal mode.  This switch must be used either  with  <b>-mh</b>
           or <b>-ms</b>.

       <b>-ms2600</b>
           Generate code for the H8S/2600.  This switch must be used with <b>-ms</b>.

       <b>-mexr</b>
           Extended  registers  are stored on stack before execution of function with monitor attribute. Default
           option is <b>-mexr</b>.  This option is valid only for H8S targets.

       <b>-mno-exr</b>
           Extended registers are not stored on stack before  execution  of  function  with  monitor  attribute.
           Default option is <b>-mno-exr</b>.  This option is valid only for H8S targets.

       <b>-mint32</b>
           Make "int" data 32 bits by default.

       <b>-malign-300</b>
           On  the H8/300H and H8S, use the same alignment rules as for the H8/300.  The default for the H8/300H
           and H8S is to align longs and floats on 4-byte boundaries.  <b>-malign-300</b> causes them to be aligned  on
           2-byte boundaries.  This option has no effect on the H8/300.

       <u>HPPA</u> <u>Options</u>

       These <b>-m</b> options are defined for the HPPA family of computers:

       <b>-march=</b><u>architecture-type</u>
           Generate  code for the specified architecture.  The choices for <u>architecture-type</u> are <b>1.0</b> for PA 1.0,
           <b>1.1</b> for PA 1.1, and <b>2.0</b> for PA 2.0 processors.  Refer to <u>/usr/lib/sched.models</u> on an HP-UX system  to
           determine  the  proper  architecture  option  for  your  machine.   Code  compiled for lower numbered
           architectures runs on higher numbered architectures, but not the other way around.

       <b>-mpa-risc-1-0</b>
       <b>-mpa-risc-1-1</b>
       <b>-mpa-risc-2-0</b>
           Synonyms for <b>-march=1.0</b>, <b>-march=1.1</b>, and <b>-march=2.0</b> respectively.

       <b>-mcaller-copies</b>
           The caller copies function arguments passed by hidden reference.  This option  should  be  used  with
           care  as  it is not compatible with the default 32-bit runtime.  However, only aggregates larger than
           eight bytes are passed by hidden reference and the option provides better compatibility with OpenMP.

       <b>-mjump-in-delay</b>
           This option is ignored and provided for compatibility purposes only.

       <b>-mdisable-fpregs</b>
           Prevent floating-point registers from being used in any manner.   This  is  necessary  for  compiling
           kernels  that perform lazy context switching of floating-point registers.  If you use this option and
           attempt to perform floating-point operations, the compiler aborts.

       <b>-mdisable-indexing</b>
           Prevent the compiler from using indexing address modes.  This avoids  some  rather  obscure  problems
           when compiling MIG generated code under MACH.

       <b>-mno-space-regs</b>
           Generate  code  that  assumes  the target has no space registers.  This allows GCC to generate faster
           indirect calls and use unscaled index address modes.

           Such code is suitable for level 0 PA systems and kernels.

       <b>-mfast-indirect-calls</b>
           Generate code that assumes calls never cross space boundaries.  This allows GCC  to  emit  code  that
           performs faster indirect calls.

           This option does not work in the presence of shared libraries or nested functions.

       <b>-mfixed-range=</b><u>register-range</u>
           Generate code treating the given register range as fixed registers.  A fixed register is one that the
           register  allocator  cannot  use.   This  is  useful when compiling kernel code.  A register range is
           specified as two registers separated by a dash.  Multiple register ranges can be specified  separated
           by a comma.

       <b>-mlong-load-store</b>
           Generate  3-instruction  load and store sequences as sometimes required by the HP-UX 10 linker.  This
           is equivalent to the <b>+k</b> option to the HP compilers.

       <b>-mportable-runtime</b>
           Use the portable calling conventions proposed by HP for ELF systems.

       <b>-mgas</b>
           Enable the use of assembler directives only GAS understands.

       <b>-mschedule=</b><u>cpu-type</u>
           Schedule code according to the constraints for the machine type <u>cpu-type</u>.  The choices  for  <u>cpu-type</u>
           are  <b>700</b>  <b>7100</b>,  <b>7100LC</b>,  <b>7200</b>,  <b>7300</b> and <b>8000</b>.  Refer to <u>/usr/lib/sched.models</u> on an HP-UX system to
           determine the proper scheduling option for your machine.  The default scheduling is <b>8000</b>.

       <b>-mlinker-opt</b>
           Enable the optimization pass in the HP-UX linker.  Note this makes symbolic debugging impossible.  It
           also triggers a bug in the HP-UX 8 and HP-UX 9 linkers in which they give bogus error  messages  when
           linking some programs.

       <b>-msoft-float</b>
           Generate  output  containing  library calls for floating point.  <b>Warning:</b> the requisite libraries are
           not available for all HPPA targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual  C  compiler  are
           used,  but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make your own arrangements to
           provide suitable library functions for cross-compilation.

           <b>-msoft-float</b> changes the calling convention in the output file; therefore, it is only useful  if  you
           compile  <u>all</u> of a program with this option.  In particular, you need to compile <u>libgcc.a</u>, the library
           that comes with GCC, with <b>-msoft-float</b> in order for this to work.

       <b>-msio</b>
           Generate the predefine,  "_SIO",  for  server  IO.   The  default  is  <b>-mwsio</b>.   This  generates  the
           predefines,  "__hp9000s700",  "__hp9000s700__"  and  "_WSIO",  for workstation IO.  These options are
           available under HP-UX and HI-UX.

       <b>-mgnu-ld</b>
           Use options specific to GNU <b>ld</b>.  This passes <b>-shared</b> to <b>ld</b> when building a shared library.  It is the
           default when GCC is configured, explicitly or implicitly, with the GNU linker.  This option does  not
           affect  which  <b>ld</b>  is  called; it only changes what parameters are passed to that <b>ld</b>.  The <b>ld</b> that is
           called is determined by the <b>--with-ld</b> configure option, GCC's program search path, and finally by the
           user's <b>PATH</b>.  The linker used by GCC can be printed  using  <b>which</b>  <b>`gcc</b>  <b>-print-prog-name=ld`</b>.   This
           option is only available on the 64-bit HP-UX GCC, i.e. configured with <b>hppa*64*-*-hpux*</b>.

       <b>-mhp-ld</b>
           Use  options  specific  to  HP  <b>ld</b>.   This  passes <b>-b</b> to <b>ld</b> when building a shared library and passes
           <b>+Accept</b> <b>TypeMismatch</b> to <b>ld</b> on all links.  It is the default when GCC  is  configured,  explicitly  or
           implicitly, with the HP linker.  This option does not affect which <b>ld</b> is called; it only changes what
           parameters  are  passed  to  that <b>ld</b>.  The <b>ld</b> that is called is determined by the <b>--with-ld</b> configure
           option, GCC's program search path, and finally by the user's <b>PATH</b>.  The linker used  by  GCC  can  be
           printed  using  <b>which</b>  <b>`gcc</b>  <b>-print-prog-name=ld`</b>.  This option is only available on the 64-bit HP-UX
           GCC, i.e. configured with <b>hppa*64*-*-hpux*</b>.

       <b>-mlong-calls</b>
           Generate code that uses long call sequences.  This ensures that a call is always able to reach linker
           generated stubs.  The default is to generate long calls only when the distance from the call site  to
           the beginning of the function or translation unit, as the case may be, exceeds a predefined limit set
           by  the  branch  type  being  used.   The  limits  for  normal calls are 7,600,000 and 240,000 bytes,
           respectively for the PA 2.0 and PA 1.X architectures.  Sibcalls are always limited at 240,000 bytes.

           Distances are measured from the beginning of functions when using the <b>-ffunction-sections</b> option,  or
           when using the <b>-mgas</b> and <b>-mno-portable-runtime</b> options together under HP-UX with the SOM linker.

           It  is  normally  not  desirable  to  use this option as it degrades performance.  However, it may be
           useful in large applications, particularly when partial linking is used to build the application.

           The types of long calls used depends on the capabilities of the assembler and linker, and the type of
           code being generated.  The impact on systems that support long absolute calls, and long  pic  symbol-
           difference  or  pc-relative  calls  should be relatively small.  However, an indirect call is used on
           32-bit ELF systems in pic code and it is quite long.

       <b>-munix=</b><u>unix-std</u>
           Generate compiler predefines and select a startfile for the specified UNIX standard.  The choices for
           <u>unix-std</u> are <b>93</b>, <b>95</b> and <b>98</b>.  <b>93</b> is supported on all HP-UX versions.  <b>95</b> is available on  HP-UX  10.10
           and  later.  <b>98</b> is available on HP-UX 11.11 and later.  The default values are <b>93</b> for HP-UX 10.00, <b>95</b>
           for HP-UX 10.10 though to 11.00, and <b>98</b> for HP-UX 11.11 and later.

           <b>-munix=93</b> provides the same predefines as GCC 3.3 and 3.4.  <b>-munix=95</b> provides additional  predefines
           for  "XOPEN_UNIX"  and  "_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED",  and  the  startfile  <u>unix95.o</u>.  <b>-munix=98</b> provides
           additional predefines for  "_XOPEN_UNIX",  "_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED",  "_INCLUDE__STDC_A1_SOURCE"  and
           "_INCLUDE_XOPEN_SOURCE_500", and the startfile <u>unix98.o</u>.

           It  is  <u>important</u>  to  note that this option changes the interfaces for various library routines.  It
           also affects the operational behavior of the C library.  Thus, <u>extreme</u> care is needed in  using  this
           option.

           Library  code that is intended to operate with more than one UNIX standard must test, set and restore
           the  variable  "__xpg4_extended_mask"  as  appropriate.   Most  GNU  software  doesn't  provide  this
           capability.

       <b>-nolibdld</b>
           Suppress  the  generation of link options to search libdld.sl when the <b>-static</b> option is specified on
           HP-UX 10 and later.

       <b>-static</b>
           The HP-UX implementation of setlocale in libc has a dependency on libdld.sl.  There isn't an  archive
           version of libdld.sl.  Thus, when the <b>-static</b> option is specified, special link options are needed to
           resolve this dependency.

           On  HP-UX  10  and  later,  the GCC driver adds the necessary options to link with libdld.sl when the
           <b>-static</b> option is specified.  This causes the resulting binary to be dynamic.  On  the  64-bit  port,
           the  linkers  generate  dynamic binaries by default in any case.  The <b>-nolibdld</b> option can be used to
           prevent the GCC driver from adding these link options.

       <b>-threads</b>
           Add support for multithreading with the <u>dce</u> <u>thread</u> library under HP-UX.  This option sets  flags  for
           both the preprocessor and linker.

       <u>IA-64</u> <u>Options</u>

       These are the <b>-m</b> options defined for the Intel IA-64 architecture.

       <b>-mbig-endian</b>
           Generate code for a big-endian target.  This is the default for HP-UX.

       <b>-mlittle-endian</b>
           Generate code for a little-endian target.  This is the default for AIX5 and GNU/Linux.

       <b>-mgnu-as</b>
       <b>-mno-gnu-as</b>
           Generate (or don't) code for the GNU assembler.  This is the default.

       <b>-mgnu-ld</b>
       <b>-mno-gnu-ld</b>
           Generate (or don't) code for the GNU linker.  This is the default.

       <b>-mno-pic</b>
           Generate  code  that  does not use a global pointer register.  The result is not position independent
           code, and violates the IA-64 ABI.

       <b>-mvolatile-asm-stop</b>
       <b>-mno-volatile-asm-stop</b>
           Generate (or don't) a stop bit immediately before and after volatile asm statements.

       <b>-mregister-names</b>
       <b>-mno-register-names</b>
           Generate (or don't) <b>in</b>, <b>loc</b>, and <b>out</b> register  names  for  the  stacked  registers.   This  may  make
           assembler output more readable.

       <b>-mno-sdata</b>
       <b>-msdata</b>
           Disable  (or  enable)  optimizations that use the small data section.  This may be useful for working
           around optimizer bugs.

       <b>-mconstant-gp</b>
           Generate code that uses a single constant global pointer value.  This is useful when compiling kernel
           code.

       <b>-mauto-pic</b>
           Generate code that is self-relocatable.  This implies <b>-mconstant-gp</b>.  This is useful  when  compiling
           firmware code.

       <b>-minline-float-divide-min-latency</b>
           Generate code for inline divides of floating-point values using the minimum latency algorithm.

       <b>-minline-float-divide-max-throughput</b>
           Generate code for inline divides of floating-point values using the maximum throughput algorithm.

       <b>-mno-inline-float-divide</b>
           Do not generate inline code for divides of floating-point values.

       <b>-minline-int-divide-min-latency</b>
           Generate code for inline divides of integer values using the minimum latency algorithm.

       <b>-minline-int-divide-max-throughput</b>
           Generate code for inline divides of integer values using the maximum throughput algorithm.

       <b>-mno-inline-int-divide</b>
           Do not generate inline code for divides of integer values.

       <b>-minline-sqrt-min-latency</b>
           Generate code for inline square roots using the minimum latency algorithm.

       <b>-minline-sqrt-max-throughput</b>
           Generate code for inline square roots using the maximum throughput algorithm.

       <b>-mno-inline-sqrt</b>
           Do not generate inline code for "sqrt".

       <b>-mfused-madd</b>
       <b>-mno-fused-madd</b>
           Do  (don't)  generate  code  that uses the fused multiply/add or multiply/subtract instructions.  The
           default is to use these instructions.

       <b>-mno-dwarf2-asm</b>
       <b>-mdwarf2-asm</b>
           Don't (or do) generate assembler code for the DWARF line number debugging info.  This may  be  useful
           when not using the GNU assembler.

       <b>-mearly-stop-bits</b>
       <b>-mno-early-stop-bits</b>
           Allow  stop  bits  to be placed earlier than immediately preceding the instruction that triggered the
           stop bit.  This can improve instruction scheduling, but does not always do so.

       <b>-mfixed-range=</b><u>register-range</u>
           Generate code treating the given register range as fixed registers.  A fixed register is one that the
           register allocator cannot use.  This is useful when compiling  kernel  code.   A  register  range  is
           specified  as two registers separated by a dash.  Multiple register ranges can be specified separated
           by a comma.

       <b>-mtls-size=</b><u>tls-size</u>
           Specify bit size of immediate TLS offsets.  Valid values are 14, 22, and 64.

       <b>-mtune=</b><u>cpu-type</u>
           Tune the instruction scheduling for a particular CPU, Valid values  are  <b>itanium</b>,  <b>itanium1</b>,  <b>merced</b>,
           <b>itanium2</b>, and <b>mckinley</b>.

       <b>-milp32</b>
       <b>-mlp64</b>
           Generate  code for a 32-bit or 64-bit environment.  The 32-bit environment sets int, long and pointer
           to 32 bits.  The 64-bit environment sets int to 32 bits and long and pointer to 64 bits.   These  are
           HP-UX specific flags.

       <b>-mno-sched-br-data-spec</b>
       <b>-msched-br-data-spec</b>
           (Dis/En)able  data  speculative  scheduling  before  reload.   This  results  in generation of "ld.a"

           disabled.

       <b>-msched-ar-data-spec</b>
       <b>-mno-sched-ar-data-spec</b>
           (En/Dis)able  data  speculative  scheduling  after  reload.   This  results  in  generation of "ld.a"
           instructions and the corresponding check instructions ("ld.c" / "chk.a").   The  default  setting  is
           enabled.

       <b>-mno-sched-control-spec</b>
       <b>-msched-control-spec</b>
           (Dis/En)able control speculative scheduling.  This feature is available only during region scheduling
           (i.e.  before  reload).   This results in generation of the "ld.s" instructions and the corresponding
           check instructions "chk.s".  The default setting is disabled.

       <b>-msched-br-in-data-spec</b>
       <b>-mno-sched-br-in-data-spec</b>
           (En/Dis)able speculative scheduling of the instructions that are dependent on  the  data  speculative
           loads  before reload.  This is effective only with <b>-msched-br-data-spec</b> enabled.  The default setting
           is enabled.

       <b>-msched-ar-in-data-spec</b>
       <b>-mno-sched-ar-in-data-spec</b>
           (En/Dis)able speculative scheduling of the instructions that are dependent on  the  data  speculative
           loads  after  reload.  This is effective only with <b>-msched-ar-data-spec</b> enabled.  The default setting
           is enabled.

       <b>-msched-in-control-spec</b>
       <b>-mno-sched-in-control-spec</b>
           (En/Dis)able speculative scheduling of the instructions that are dependent on the control speculative

       <b>-mno-sched-prefer-non-data-spec-insns</b>
       <b>-msched-prefer-non-data-spec-insns</b>
           If enabled, data-speculative instructions are chosen for schedule only if there are no other  choices
           at  the  moment.   This  makes  the  use of the data speculation much more conservative.  The default
           setting is disabled.

       <b>-mno-sched-prefer-non-control-spec-insns</b>
       <b>-msched-prefer-non-control-spec-insns</b>
           If enabled, control-speculative instructions are chosen for schedule  only  if  there  are  no  other
           choices  at  the  moment.  This makes the use of the control speculation much more conservative.  The
           default setting is disabled.

       <b>-mno-sched-count-spec-in-critical-path</b>
       <b>-msched-count-spec-in-critical-path</b>
           If  enabled,  speculative  dependencies  are  considered  during  computation  of  the   instructions
           priorities.   This  makes the use of the speculation a bit more conservative.  The default setting is
           disabled.

       <b>-msched-spec-ldc</b>
           Use a simple data speculation check.  This option is on by default.

       <b>-msched-control-spec-ldc</b>
           Use a simple check for control speculation.  This option is on by default.

       <b>-msched-stop-bits-after-every-cycle</b>
           Place a stop bit after every cycle when scheduling.  This option is on by default.

       <b>-msched-fp-mem-deps-zero-cost</b>
           Assume that floating-point stores and loads are not likely to cause a conflict when placed  into  the
           same instruction group.  This option is disabled by default.

       <b>-msel-sched-dont-check-control-spec</b>
           Generate checks for control speculation in selective scheduling.  This flag is disabled by default.

       <b>-msched-max-memory-insns=</b><u>max-insns</u>
           Limit on the number of memory insns per instruction group, giving lower priority to subsequent memory
           insns  attempting  to schedule in the same instruction group. Frequently useful to prevent cache bank
           conflicts.  The default value is 1.

       <b>-msched-max-memory-insns-hard-limit</b>
           Makes the limit specified by <b>msched-max-memory-insns</b> a hard limit, disallowing more than that  number
           in  an  instruction  group.   Otherwise,  the limit is "soft", meaning that non-memory operations are
           preferred when the limit is reached, but memory operations may still be scheduled.

       <u>LM32</u> <u>Options</u>

       These <b>-m</b> options are defined for the LatticeMico32 architecture:

       <b>-mbarrel-shift-enabled</b>
           Enable barrel-shift instructions.

       <b>-mdivide-enabled</b>
           Enable divide and modulus instructions.

       <b>-mmultiply-enabled</b>
           Enable multiply instructions.

       <b>-msign-extend-enabled</b>
           Enable sign extend instructions.

       <b>-muser-enabled</b>
           Enable user-defined instructions.

       <u>M32C</u> <u>Options</u>

       <b>-mcpu=</b><u>name</u>
           Select the CPU for which code is generated.  <u>name</u> may be one of <b>r8c</b> for the R8C/Tiny series, <b>m16c</b> for
           the M16C (up to /60) series, <b>m32cm</b> for the M16C/80 series, or <b>m32c</b> for the M32C/80 series.

       <b>-msim</b>
           Specifies that the program will be run on the simulator.  This causes an alternate runtime library to
           be linked in which supports, for example, file I/O.  You must not use  this  option  when  generating
           programs  that  will run on real hardware; you must provide your own runtime library for whatever I/O
           functions are needed.

       <b>-memregs=</b><u>number</u>
           Specifies the number of memory-based pseudo-registers GCC uses during code generation.  These pseudo-
           registers are used like real registers, so there is a tradeoff between GCC's ability to fit the  code
           into  available  registers,  and  the performance penalty of using memory instead of registers.  Note
           that all modules in a program must be compiled with the same value for this option.  Because of that,
           you must not use this option with GCC's default runtime libraries.

       <u>M32R/D</u> <u>Options</u>

       These <b>-m</b> options are defined for Renesas M32R/D architectures:

       <b>-m32r2</b>
           Generate code for the M32R/2.

       <b>-m32rx</b>
           Generate code for the M32R/X.

       <b>-m32r</b>
           Generate code for the M32R.  This is the default.

       <b>-mmodel=small</b>
           Assume all objects live in the lower 16MB of memory (so that their addresses can be loaded  with  the
           "ld24" instruction), and assume all subroutines are reachable with the "bl" instruction.  This is the
           default.

           The addressability of a particular object can be set with the "model" attribute.

       <b>-mmodel=medium</b>
           Assume  objects  may  be  anywhere  in  the  32-bit address space (the compiler generates "seth/add3"
           instructions to load their addresses), and  assume  all  subroutines  are  reachable  with  the  "bl"
           instruction.

       <b>-mmodel=large</b>
           Assume  objects  may  be  anywhere  in  the  32-bit address space (the compiler generates "seth/add3"
           instructions to load their addresses), and assume subroutines may not  be  reachable  with  the  "bl"
           instruction (the compiler generates the much slower "seth/add3/jl" instruction sequence).

       <b>-msdata=none</b>
           Disable  use  of  the  small  data area.  Variables are put into one of ".data", ".bss", or ".rodata"
           (unless the "section" attribute has been specified).  This is the default.

           The small data area consists of sections ".sdata" and ".sbss".  Objects may be explicitly put in  the
           small data area with the "section" attribute using one of these sections.

       <b>-msdata=sdata</b>
           Put  small  global  and  static  data  in  the  small  data area, but do not generate special code to
           reference them.

       <b>-msdata=use</b>
           Put small global and static data in the  small  data  area,  and  generate  special  instructions  to
           reference them.

       <b>-G</b> <u>num</u>
           Put  global  and  static  objects less than or equal to <u>num</u> bytes into the small data or BSS sections
           instead of the normal data or BSS sections.  The default value of <u>num</u> is 8.  The <b>-msdata</b> option  must
           be set to one of <b>sdata</b> or <b>use</b> for this option to have any effect.

           All  modules  should  be compiled with the same <b>-G</b> <u>num</u> value.  Compiling with different values of <u>num</u>
           may or may not work; if it doesn't  the  linker  gives  an  error  message---incorrect  code  is  not
           generated.

       <b>-mdebug</b>
           Makes  the  M32R-specific  code  in the compiler display some statistics that might help in debugging
           programs.

       <b>-malign-loops</b>
           Align all loops to a 32-byte boundary.

       <b>-mno-align-loops</b>
           Do not enforce a 32-byte alignment for loops.  This is the default.

       <b>-missue-rate=</b><u>number</u>
           Issue <u>number</u> instructions per cycle.  <u>number</u> can only be 1 or 2.

       <b>-mbranch-cost=</b><u>number</u>
           <u>number</u> can only be 1 or 2.  If it is 1 then branches are preferred over conditional code, if it is 2,
           then the opposite applies.

       <b>-mflush-trap=</b><u>number</u>
           Specifies the trap number to use to flush the cache.  The default is 12.  Valid numbers are between 0
           and 15 inclusive.

       <b>-mno-flush-trap</b>
           Specifies that the cache cannot be flushed by using a trap.

       <b>-mflush-func=</b><u>name</u>
           Specifies the name of the operating system function to call to  flush  the  cache.   The  default  is
           <b>_flush_cache</b>, but a function call is only used if a trap is not available.

       <b>-mno-flush-func</b>
           Indicates that there is no OS function for flushing the cache.

       <u>M680x0</u> <u>Options</u>

       These  are  the  <b>-m</b>  options  defined for M680x0 and ColdFire processors.  The default settings depend on
       which architecture was selected when the compiler was  configured;  the  defaults  for  the  most  common
       choices are given below.

       <b>-march=</b><u>arch</u>
           Generate  code for a specific M680x0 or ColdFire instruction set architecture.  Permissible values of
           <u>arch</u> for M680x0 architectures are: <b>68000</b>, <b>68010</b>, <b>68020</b>, <b>68030</b>,  <b>68040</b>,  <b>68060</b>  and  <b>cpu32</b>.   ColdFire
           architectures  are  selected  according  to Freescale's ISA classification and the permissible values
           are: <b>isaa</b>, <b>isaaplus</b>, <b>isab</b> and <b>isac</b>.

           GCC defines a macro "__mcf<u>arch</u>__" whenever it is generating code for a ColdFire target.  The <u>arch</u>  in
           this macro is one of the <b>-march</b> arguments given above.

           When  used  together,  <b>-march</b>  and <b>-mtune</b> select code that runs on a family of similar processors but
           that is optimized for a particular microarchitecture.

       <b>-mcpu=</b><u>cpu</u>
           Generate code for a specific M680x0 or ColdFire processor.  The M680x0 <u>cpu</u>s are: <b>68000</b>, <b>68010</b>, <b>68020</b>,
           <b>68030</b>, <b>68040</b>, <b>68060</b>, <b>68302</b>, <b>68332</b> and <b>cpu32</b>.  The ColdFire <u>cpu</u>s are given by the table  below,  which
           also classifies the CPUs into families:

           <b>-mcpu=</b><u>cpu</u>  overrides  <b>-march=</b><u>arch</u>  if  <u>arch</u>  is compatible with <u>cpu</u>.  Other combinations of <b>-mcpu</b> and
           <b>-march</b> are rejected.

           GCC defines the macro "__mcf_cpu_<u>cpu</u>"  when  ColdFire  target  <u>cpu</u>  is  selected.   It  also  defines
           "__mcf_family_<u>family</u>", where the value of <u>family</u> is given by the table above.

       <b>-mtune=</b><u>tune</u>
           Tune the code for a particular microarchitecture within the constraints set by <b>-march</b> and <b>-mcpu</b>.  The
           M680x0  microarchitectures  are:  <b>68000</b>,  <b>68010</b>,  <b>68020</b>, <b>68030</b>, <b>68040</b>, <b>68060</b> and <b>cpu32</b>.  The ColdFire
           microarchitectures are: <b>cfv1</b>, <b>cfv2</b>, <b>cfv3</b>, <b>cfv4</b> and <b>cfv4e</b>.

           You can also use <b>-mtune=68020-40</b> for code that needs to run relatively well on 68020, 68030 and 68040
           targets.  <b>-mtune=68020-60</b> is similar but includes 68060 targets as well.  These  two  options  select
           the same tuning decisions as <b>-m68020-40</b> and <b>-m68020-60</b> respectively.

           GCC  defines the macros "__mc<u>arch</u>" and "__mc<u>arch</u>__" when tuning for 680x0 architecture <u>arch</u>.  It also
           defines "mc<u>arch</u>" unless either <b>-ansi</b> or a non-GNU <b>-std</b> option is used.  If GCC is tuning for a  range
           of  architectures, as selected by <b>-mtune=68020-40</b> or <b>-mtune=68020-60</b>, it defines the macros for every
           architecture in the range.

           GCC also defines the macro "__m<u>uarch</u>__" when tuning for ColdFire microarchitecture <u>uarch</u>, where <u>uarch</u>
           is one of the arguments given above.

       <b>-m68000</b>
       <b>-mc68000</b>
           Generate output for a 68000.  This is the default when the compiler  is  configured  for  68000-based
           systems.  It is equivalent to <b>-march=68000</b>.

           Use  this  option for microcontrollers with a 68000 or EC000 core, including the 68008, 68302, 68306,
           68307, 68322, 68328 and 68356.

       <b>-m68010</b>
           Generate output for a 68010.  This is the default when the compiler  is  configured  for  68010-based
           systems.  It is equivalent to <b>-march=68010</b>.

       <b>-m68020</b>
       <b>-mc68020</b>
           Generate  output  for  a  68020.  This is the default when the compiler is configured for 68020-based

       <b>-m68040</b>
           Generate  output  for  a  68040.  This is the default when the compiler is configured for 68040-based
           systems.  It is equivalent to <b>-march=68040</b>.

           This option inhibits the use of 68881/68882 instructions that have to be emulated by software on  the
           68040.  Use this option if your 68040 does not have code to emulate those instructions.

       <b>-m68060</b>
           Generate  output  for  a  68060.  This is the default when the compiler is configured for 68060-based
           systems.  It is equivalent to <b>-march=68060</b>.

           This option inhibits the use of 68020 and 68881/68882  instructions  that  have  to  be  emulated  by
           software  on  the  68060.   Use  this  option  if  your  68060  does  not  have code to emulate those

       <b>-mcpu32</b>
           Generate output for a CPU32.  This is the default when the compiler  is  configured  for  CPU32-based
           systems.  It is equivalent to <b>-march=cpu32</b>.

           Use  this option for microcontrollers with a CPU32 or CPU32+ core, including the 68330, 68331, 68332,
           68333, 68334, 68336, 68340, 68341, 68349 and 68360.

       <b>-m5200</b>
           Generate output for a 520X ColdFire CPU.  This is the default when the  compiler  is  configured  for
           520X-based systems.  It is equivalent to <b>-mcpu=5206</b>, and is now deprecated in favor of that option.

           Use  this  option  for  microcontroller with a 5200 core, including the MCF5202, MCF5203, MCF5204 and
           MCF5206.

       <b>-m5206e</b>
           Generate output for a 5206e ColdFire CPU.  The option is now deprecated in favor  of  the  equivalent

           Generate output for a ColdFire V4e family CPU  (e.g.  547x/548x).   This  includes  use  of  hardware
           floating-point  instructions.  The option is equivalent to <b>-mcpu=547x</b>, and is now deprecated in favor
           of that option.

       <b>-m68020-40</b>
           Generate output for a 68040, without using any of the new instructions.  This results  in  code  that
           can  run  relatively  efficiently  on either a 68020/68881 or a 68030 or a 68040.  The generated code
           does use the 68881 instructions that are emulated on the 68040.

           The option is equivalent to <b>-march=68020</b> <b>-mtune=68020-40</b>.

       <b>-m68020-60</b>
           Generate output for a 68060, without using any of the new instructions.  This results  in  code  that
           can  run  relatively  efficiently  on either a 68020/68881 or a 68030 or a 68040.  The generated code
           does use the 68881 instructions that are emulated on the 68060.

           The option is equivalent to <b>-march=68020</b> <b>-mtune=68020-60</b>.

       <b>-mhard-float</b>
       <b>-m68881</b>
           Generate floating-point instructions.  This is the default for 68020  and  above,  and  for  ColdFire
           devices  that  have an FPU.  It defines the macro "__HAVE_68881__" on M680x0 targets and "__mcffpu__"
           on ColdFire targets.

       <b>-msoft-float</b>
           Do not generate floating-point instructions; use library calls instead.   This  is  the  default  for
           68000, 68010, and 68832 targets.  It is also the default for ColdFire devices that have no FPU.

       <b>-mdiv</b>
       <b>-mno-div</b>
           Generate  (do  not  generate) ColdFire hardware divide and remainder instructions.  If <b>-march</b> is used
           without <b>-mcpu</b>, the default is "on" for ColdFire architectures and  "off"  for  M680x0  architectures.
           Otherwise,  the default is taken from the target CPU (either the default CPU, or the one specified by
           <b>-mcpu</b>).  For example, the default is "off" for <b>-mcpu=5206</b> and "on" for <b>-mcpu=5206e</b>.

           GCC defines the macro "__mcfhwdiv__" when this option is enabled.

       <b>-mshort</b>
           Consider type "int" to be 16 bits wide, like "short int".  Additionally,  parameters  passed  on  the
           stack are also aligned to a 16-bit boundary even on targets whose API mandates promotion to 32-bit.

       <b>-mno-short</b>
           Do not consider type "int" to be 16 bits wide.  This is the default.

       <b>-mnobitfield</b>
       <b>-mno-bitfield</b>
           Do not use the bit-field instructions.  The <b>-m68000</b>, <b>-mcpu32</b> and <b>-m5200</b> options imply <b>-mnobitfield</b>.

       <b>-mbitfield</b>
           Do  use  the  bit-field instructions.  The <b>-m68020</b> option implies <b>-mbitfield</b>.  This is the default if
           you use a configuration designed for a 68020.

       <b>-mrtd</b>
           Use a different function-calling convention, in which functions that take a fixed number of arguments
           return with the "rtd" instruction, which pops  their  arguments  while  returning.   This  saves  one
           instruction in the caller since there is no need to pop the arguments there.

           This  calling  convention is incompatible with the one normally used on Unix, so you cannot use it if
           you need to call libraries compiled with the Unix compiler.

           Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions that take variable numbers of  arguments
           (including "printf"); otherwise incorrect code is generated for calls to those functions.

           In  addition,  seriously  incorrect  code  results  if  you  call a function with too many arguments.
           (Normally, extra arguments are harmlessly ignored.)

           The "rtd" instruction is supported by the 68010, 68020, 68030, 68040, 68060 and CPU32 processors, but
           not by the 68000 or 5200.

           The default is <b>-mno-rtd</b>.

       <b>-malign-int</b>
       <b>-mno-align-int</b>
           Control whether GCC aligns "int", "long", "long long", "float", "double", and "long double" variables
           on a 32-bit boundary (<b>-malign-int</b>) or a 16-bit  boundary  (<b>-mno-align-int</b>).   Aligning  variables  on
           32-bit  boundaries  produces  code  that runs somewhat faster on processors with 32-bit busses at the
           expense of more memory.

           <b>Warning:</b> if you use the  <b>-malign-int</b>  switch,  GCC  aligns  structures  containing  the  above  types
           differently than most published application binary interface specifications for the m68k.

           Use  the  pc-relative  addressing mode of the 68000 directly, instead of using a global offset table.
           At present, this option implies <b>-fpic</b>, allowing at most a 16-bit offset for  pc-relative  addressing.
           <b>-fPIC</b>  is  not  presently supported with <b>-mpcrel</b>, though this could be supported for 68020 and higher
           processors.

       <b>-mno-strict-align</b>
       <b>-mstrict-align</b>
           Do not (do) assume that unaligned memory references are handled by the system.

       <b>-msep-data</b>
           Generate code that allows the data segment to be located in a different area of memory from the  text
           segment.  This allows for execute-in-place in an environment without virtual memory management.  This
           option implies <b>-fPIC</b>.

       <b>-mno-sep-data</b>
           Generate code that assumes that the data segment follows the text segment.  This is the default.

       <b>-mid-shared-library</b>
           Generate  code that supports shared libraries via the library ID method.  This allows for execute-in-
           place and shared libraries in an environment without virtual memory management.  This option  implies
           <b>-fPIC</b>.

       <b>-mno-id-shared-library</b>
           Generate code that doesn't assume ID-based shared libraries are being used.  This is the default.

       <b>-mshared-library-id=n</b>
           Specifies  the  identification  number  of  the ID-based shared library being compiled.  Specifying a
           value of 0 generates more compact code; specifying other values forces the allocation of that  number
           to the current library, but is no more space- or time-efficient than omitting this option.

       <b>-mxgot</b>
       <b>-mno-xgot</b>
           When  generating position-independent code for ColdFire, generate code that works if the GOT has more
           than 8192 entries.  This code is larger and slower than  code  generated  without  this  option.   On
           M680x0 processors, this option is not needed; <b>-fPIC</b> suffices.

           GCC  normally  uses  a  single  instruction  to  load  values from the GOT.  While this is relatively
           efficient, it only works if the GOT is smaller than about 64k.  Anything larger causes the linker  to
           report an error such as:

                   relocation truncated to fit: R_68K_GOT16O foobar

           If  this  happens,  you  should recompile your code with <b>-mxgot</b>.  It should then work with very large
           GOTs.  However, code generated with <b>-mxgot</b> is less efficient, since it takes 4 instructions to  fetch
           the value of a global symbol.

           Note that some linkers, including newer versions of the GNU linker, can create multiple GOTs and sort
           GOT  entries.   If you have such a linker, you should only need to use <b>-mxgot</b> when compiling a single
           object file that accesses more than 8192 GOT entries.  Very few do.

           These options have no effect unless GCC is generating position-independent code.

       <b>-mlong-jump-table-offsets</b>
           Use 32-bit offsets in "switch" tables.  The default is to use 16-bit offsets.

       <u>MCore</u> <u>Options</u>

       These are the <b>-m</b> options defined for the Motorola M*Core processors.

       <b>-mhardlit</b>
       <b>-mno-hardlit</b>
           Inline constants into the code stream if it can be done in two instructions or less.

       <b>-mdiv</b>
       <b>-mno-div</b>
           Use the divide instruction.  (Enabled by default).

       <b>-mrelax-immediate</b>
       <b>-mno-relax-immediate</b>
           Allow arbitrary-sized immediates in bit operations.

       <b>-mwide-bitfields</b>
       <b>-mno-wide-bitfields</b>
           Always treat bit-fields as "int"-sized.

       <b>-m4byte-functions</b>
       <b>-mno-4byte-functions</b>
           Force all functions to be aligned to a 4-byte boundary.

       <b>-mcallgraph-data</b>
       <b>-mno-callgraph-data</b>
           Emit callgraph information.

       <b>-mslow-bytes</b>
       <b>-mno-slow-bytes</b>
           Prefer word access when reading byte quantities.

       <b>-mlittle-endian</b>
       <b>-mbig-endian</b>
           Generate code for a little-endian target.

       <b>-m210</b>
       <b>-m340</b>
           Generate code for the 210 processor.

       <b>-mno-lsim</b>
           Assume that runtime support has been provided and so omit the simulator library (<u>libsim.a)</u>  from  the
           linker command line.

       <b>-mstack-increment=</b><u>size</u>
           Set  the  maximum amount for a single stack increment operation.  Large values can increase the speed
           of programs that contain functions that need a large amount of stack space, but they can also trigger
           a segmentation fault if the stack is extended too much.  The default value is 0x1000.

       <u>MeP</u> <u>Options</u>

       <b>-mabsdiff</b>
           Enables the "abs" instruction, which is the absolute difference between two registers.

       <b>-mall-opts</b>
           Enables all the optional instructions---average, multiply,  divide,  bit  operations,  leading  zero,
           absolute difference, min/max, clip, and saturation.

       <b>-maverage</b>
           Enables the "ave" instruction, which computes the average of two registers.

       <b>-mbased=</b><u>n</u>
           Variables  of size <u>n</u> bytes or smaller are placed in the ".based" section by default.  Based variables
           use the $tp register as a base register, and there is a 128-byte limit to the ".based" section.

       <b>-mbitops</b>
           Enables the bit operation instructions---bit test ("btstm"), set ("bsetm"), clear  ("bclrm"),  invert
           ("bnotm"), and test-and-set ("tas").

       <b>-mc=</b><u>name</u>
           Selects which section constant data is placed in.  <u>name</u> may be <b>tiny</b>, <b>near</b>, or <b>far</b>.

       <b>-mclip</b>
           Enables the "clip" instruction.  Note that <b>-mclip</b> is not useful unless you also provide <b>-mminmax</b>.

       <b>-mconfig=</b><u>name</u>
           Selects  one  of the built-in core configurations.  Each MeP chip has one or more modules in it; each
           module has a core CPU and a variety of coprocessors, optional  instructions,  and  peripherals.   The
           "MeP-Integrator" tool, not part of GCC, provides these configurations through this option; using this
           option is the same as using all the corresponding command-line options.  The default configuration is
           <b>default</b>.

       <b>-mcop</b>
           Enables  the  coprocessor  instructions.   By  default,  this is a 32-bit coprocessor.  Note that the
           coprocessor is normally enabled via the <b>-mconfig=</b> option.

       <b>-mcop32</b>
           Enables the 32-bit coprocessor's instructions.

       <b>-mcop64</b>
           Enables the 64-bit coprocessor's instructions.

       <b>-mivc2</b>
           Enables IVC2 scheduling.  IVC2 is a 64-bit VLIW coprocessor.

       <b>-mdc</b>
           Causes constant variables to be placed in the ".near" section.

       <b>-mdiv</b>
           Enables the "div" and "divu" instructions.

       <b>-meb</b>
           Generate big-endian code.

       <b>-mel</b>
           Generate little-endian code.

       <b>-mio-volatile</b>
           Tells the compiler that any variable marked with the "io" attribute is to be considered volatile.

       <b>-ml</b> Causes variables to be assigned to the ".far" section by default.

       <b>-mleadz</b>
           Enables the "leadz" (leading zero) instruction.

       <b>-mm</b> Causes variables to be assigned to the ".near" section by default.

       <b>-mminmax</b>
           Enables the "min" and "max" instructions.

       <b>-mmult</b>
           Enables the multiplication and multiply-accumulate instructions.

       <b>-mno-opts</b>
           Disables all the optional instructions enabled by <b>-mall-opts</b>.

       <b>-mrepeat</b>
           Enables the "repeat" and "erepeat" instructions, used for low-overhead looping.

       <b>-ms</b> Causes all variables to default to the ".tiny" section.  Note that there is  a  65536-byte  limit  to
           this section.  Accesses to these variables use the %gp base register.

       <b>-msatur</b>
           Enables  the  saturation  instructions.   Note  that  the  compiler does not currently generate these
           itself, but this option is included for compatibility with other tools, like "as".

       <b>-msdram</b>
           Link the SDRAM-based runtime instead of the default ROM-based runtime.

       <b>-msim</b>
           Link the simulator run-time libraries.

       <b>-msimnovec</b>
           Link the simulator runtime libraries, excluding built-in support for reset and exception vectors  and
           tables.

       <b>-mtf</b>
           Causes all functions to default to the ".far" section.  Without this option, functions default to the
           ".near" section.

       <b>-mtiny=</b><u>n</u>
           Variables  that are <u>n</u> bytes or smaller are allocated to the ".tiny" section.  These variables use the
           $gp base register.  The default for this option is 4, but note that there's a 65536-byte limit to the
           ".tiny" section.

       <u>MicroBlaze</u> <u>Options</u>

       <b>-msoft-float</b>
           Use software emulation for floating point (default).

       <b>-mhard-float</b>
           Use hardware floating-point instructions.

       <b>-mmemcpy</b>
           Do not optimize block moves, use "memcpy".

       <b>-mno-clearbss</b>
           This option is deprecated.  Use <b>-fno-zero-initialized-in-bss</b> instead.

       <b>-mcpu=</b><u>cpu-type</u>
           Use features of, and schedule code for, the given CPU.  Supported values are in the  format  <b>v</b><u>X</u><b>.</b><u>YY</u><b>.</b><u>Z</u>,
           where <u>X</u> is a major version, <u>YY</u> is the minor version, and <u>Z</u> is compatibility code.  Example values are
           <b>v3.00.a</b>, <b>v4.00.b</b>, <b>v5.00.a</b>, <b>v5.00.b</b>, <b>v6.00.a</b>.

       <b>-mxl-soft-mul</b>
           Use software multiply emulation (default).

       <b>-mxl-soft-div</b>
           Use software emulation for divides (default).

       <b>-mxl-barrel-shift</b>
           Use the hardware barrel shifter.

       <b>-mxl-pattern-compare</b>
           Use pattern compare instructions.

       <b>-msmall-divides</b>
           Use table lookup optimization for small signed integer divisions.

       <b>-mxl-stack-check</b>
           This option is deprecated.  Use <b>-fstack-check</b> instead.

       <b>-mxl-gp-opt</b>
           Use GP-relative ".sdata"/".sbss" sections.

       <b>-mxl-multiply-high</b>
           Use multiply high instructions for high part of 32x32 multiply.

       <b>-mxl-float-convert</b>
           Use hardware floating-point conversion instructions.

       <b>-mxl-float-sqrt</b>
           Use hardware floating-point square root instruction.

       <b>-mbig-endian</b>
           Generate code for a big-endian target.

       <b>-mlittle-endian</b>
           Generate code for a little-endian target.

       <b>-mxl-reorder</b>
           Use reorder instructions (swap and byte reversed load/store).

       <b>-mxl-mode-</b><u>app-model</u>
           Select application model <u>app-model</u>.  Valid models are

           <b>executable</b>
               normal executable (default), uses startup code <u>crt0.o</u>.

           <b>-mpic-data-is-text-relative</b>
               Assume  that  the  displacement  between the text and data segments is fixed at static link time.
               This allows data to be referenced by offset from start of text address instead of GOT  since  PC-
               relative addressing is not supported.

           <b>xmdstub</b>
               for  use  with  Xilinx  Microprocessor Debugger (XMD) based software intrusive debug agent called
               xmdstub. This uses startup file <u>crt1.o</u> and sets the start address of the program to 0x800.

           <b>bootstrap</b>
               for applications that are loaded using a bootloader.  This model uses startup file  <u>crt2.o</u>  which
               does not contain a processor reset vector handler. This is suitable for transferring control on a
               processor reset to the bootloader rather than the application.

           <b>novectors</b>
               for applications that do not require any of the MicroBlaze vectors. This option may be useful for
               applications running within a monitoring application. This model uses <u>crt3.o</u> as a startup file.

           Option <b>-xl-mode-</b><u>app-model</u> is a deprecated alias for <b>-mxl-mode-</b><u>app-model</u>.

       <u>MIPS</u> <u>Options</u>

       <b>-EB</b> Generate big-endian code.

       <b>-EL</b> Generate little-endian code.  This is the default for <b>mips*el-*-*</b> configurations.

       <b>-march=</b><u>arch</u>
           Generate  code  that  runs  on  <u>arch</u>,  which  can be the name of a generic MIPS ISA, or the name of a
           particular processor.  The ISA names are: <b>mips1</b>, <b>mips2</b>, <b>mips3</b>,  <b>mips4</b>,  <b>mips32</b>,  <b>mips32r2</b>,  <b>mips32r3</b>,

           <b>xlr</b> and <b>xlp</b>.  The special value <b>from-abi</b> selects the most compatible architecture  for  the  selected
           ABI (that is, <b>mips1</b> for 32-bit ABIs and <b>mips3</b> for 64-bit ABIs).

           The  native  Linux/GNU  toolchain also supports the value <b>native</b>, which selects the best architecture
           option for the host processor.  <b>-march=native</b> has no effect if GCC does not recognize the processor.

           In processor names, a final <b>000</b> can be abbreviated as <b>k</b>  (for  example,  <b>-march=r2k</b>).   Prefixes  are
           optional, and <b>vr</b> may be written <b>r</b>.

           Names  of the form <u>n</u><b>f2_1</b> refer to processors with FPUs clocked at half the rate of the core, names of
           the form <u>n</u><b>f1_1</b> refer to processors with FPUs clocked at the same rate as the core, and names  of  the
           form  <u>n</u><b>f3_2</b>  refer  to  processors  with  FPUs  clocked a ratio of 3:2 with respect to the core.  For
           compatibility reasons, <u>n</u><b>f</b> is accepted as a synonym for  <u>n</u><b>f2_1</b>  while  <u>n</u><b>x</b>  and  <u>b</u><b>fx</b>  are  accepted  as
           synonyms for <u>n</u><b>f1_1</b>.

           GCC defines two macros based on the value of this option.  The first is "_MIPS_ARCH", which gives the
           name of target architecture, as a string.  The second has the form "_MIPS_ARCH_<u>foo</u>", where <u>foo</u> is the
           capitalized  value  of  "_MIPS_ARCH".   For  example,  <b>-march=r2000</b>  sets "_MIPS_ARCH" to "r2000" and
           defines the macro "_MIPS_ARCH_R2000".

           Note that the "_MIPS_ARCH" macro uses the processor names given above.  In other words,  it  has  the
           full  prefix and does not abbreviate <b>000</b> as <b>k</b>.  In the case of <b>from-abi</b>, the macro names the resolved
           architecture (either "mips1" or "mips3").  It names the default architecture when no <b>-march</b> option is
           given.

       <b>-mtune=</b><u>arch</u>
           Optimize for <u>arch</u>.  Among other things, this option controls the way instructions are scheduled,  and
           the perceived cost of arithmetic operations.  The list of <u>arch</u> values is the same as for <b>-march</b>.

           When  this  option is not used, GCC optimizes for the processor specified by <b>-march</b>.  By using <b>-march</b>
           and <b>-mtune</b> together, it is possible to generate code  that  runs  on  a  family  of  processors,  but
           optimize the code for one particular member of that family.

           <b>-mtune</b> defines the macros "_MIPS_TUNE" and "_MIPS_TUNE_<u>foo</u>", which work in the same way as the <b>-march</b>
           ones described above.

       <b>-mips1</b>
           Equivalent to <b>-march=mips1</b>.

       <b>-mips2</b>
           Equivalent to <b>-march=mips2</b>.

       <b>-mips3</b>
           Equivalent to <b>-march=mips3</b>.

       <b>-mips4</b>
           Equivalent to <b>-march=mips4</b>.

       <b>-mips32</b>
           Equivalent to <b>-march=mips32</b>.

       <b>-mips32r3</b>
           Equivalent to <b>-march=mips32r3</b>.

       <b>-mips32r5</b>
           Equivalent to <b>-march=mips32r5</b>.

       <b>-mips16</b>
       <b>-mno-mips16</b>
           Generate  (do  not  generate)  MIPS16  code.  If GCC is targeting a MIPS32 or MIPS64 architecture, it
           makes use of the MIPS16e ASE.

           MIPS16 code generation can also be controlled on a  per-function  basis  by  means  of  "mips16"  and
           "nomips16" attributes.

       <b>-mflip-mips16</b>
           Generate  MIPS16  code  on  alternating functions.  This option is provided for regression testing of
           mixed MIPS16/non-MIPS16 code generation, and is not intended for ordinary use in compiling user code.

       <b>-minterlink-compressed</b>
       <b>-mno-interlink-compressed</b>
           Require (do not require) that code using the standard (uncompressed) MIPS ISA be link-compatible with
           MIPS16 and microMIPS code, and vice versa.

           For example, code using the standard ISA encoding cannot jump directly to MIPS16 or  microMIPS  code;
           it  must  either  use  a  call or an indirect jump.  <b>-minterlink-compressed</b> therefore disables direct
           jumps unless GCC knows that the target of the jump is not compressed.

       <b>-minterlink-mips16</b>
       <b>-mno-interlink-mips16</b>
           Aliases of <b>-minterlink-compressed</b> and <b>-mno-interlink-compressed</b>.  These options predate the microMIPS
           ASE and are retained for backwards compatibility.

       <b>-mabi=32</b>
       <b>-mabi=o64</b>
       <b>-mabi=n32</b>
       <b>-mabi=64</b>
       <b>-mabi=eabi</b>
           Generate code for the given ABI.

           Note that the EABI has a 32-bit and a 64-bit variant.  GCC normally generates 64-bit  code  when  you
           select a 64-bit architecture, but you can use <b>-mgp32</b> to get 32-bit code instead.

           For information about the O64 ABI, see &lt;<b><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/mipso64-abi.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/mipso64-abi.html</a></b>&gt;.

           GCC  supports  a  variant of the o32 ABI in which floating-point registers are 64 rather than 32 bits
           wide.  You can select this combination with <b>-mabi=32</b> <b>-mfp64</b>.  This ABI  relies  on  the  "mthc1"  and
           "mfhc1" instructions and is therefore only supported for MIPS32R2, MIPS32R3 and MIPS32R5 processors.

           The  register  assignments  for arguments and return values remain the same, but each scalar value is
           passed in a single 64-bit register rather than a pair  of  32-bit  registers.   For  example,  scalar
           floating-point  values are returned in <b>$f0</b> only, not a <b>$f0</b>/<b>$f1</b> pair.  The set of call-saved registers
           also remains the same in that the even-numbered double-precision registers are saved.

           Two additional variants of the o32 ABI are supported to enable a transition  from  32-bit  to  64-bit
           registers.   These  are FPXX (<b>-mfpxx</b>) and FP64A (<b>-mfp64</b> <b>-mno-odd-spreg</b>).  The FPXX extension mandates
           that all code must execute correctly when run using 32-bit or 64-bit  registers.   The  code  can  be
           interlinked  with  either  FP32  or  FP64,  but not both.  The FP64A extension is similar to the FP64
           extension but forbids the use of odd-numbered  single-precision  registers.   This  can  be  used  in
           conjunction with the "FRE" mode of FPUs in MIPS32R5 processors and allows both FP32 and FP64A code to
           interlink and run in the same process without changing FPU modes.

       <b>-mabicalls</b>
       <b>-mno-abicalls</b>
           Generate  (do  not generate) code that is suitable for SVR4-style dynamic objects.  <b>-mabicalls</b> is the
           default for SVR4-based systems.

       <b>-mshared</b>
       <b>-mno-shared</b>
           Generate (do not generate) code that is fully position-independent, and that can therefore be  linked
           into shared libraries.  This option only affects <b>-mabicalls</b>.

           All <b>-mabicalls</b> code has traditionally been position-independent, regardless of options like <b>-fPIC</b> and
           <b>-fpic</b>.   However,  as an extension, the GNU toolchain allows executables to use absolute accesses for
           locally-binding symbols.  It can also use shorter GP initialization  sequences  and  generate  direct
           calls to locally-defined functions.  This mode is selected by <b>-mno-shared</b>.

           <b>-mno-shared</b>  depends  on binutils 2.16 or higher and generates objects that can only be linked by the
           GNU linker.  However, the option does not affect the ABI of the final executable; it only affects the
           ABI of relocatable objects.  Using <b>-mno-shared</b> generally makes executables both smaller and quicker.

           <b>-mshared</b> is the default.

       <b>-mplt</b>
       <b>-mno-plt</b>
           Assume (do not assume) that the static and dynamic linkers support PLTs and copy  relocations.   This
           option  only  affects  <b>-mno-shared</b>  <b>-mabicalls</b>.   For  the n64 ABI, this option has no effect without
           <b>-msym32</b>.

           You can make <b>-mplt</b> the default by configuring GCC with  <b>--with-mips-plt</b>.   The  default  is  <b>-mno-plt</b>
           otherwise.

       <b>-mxgot</b>
       <b>-mno-xgot</b>
           Lift (do not lift) the usual restrictions on the size of the global offset table.

           GCC  normally  uses  a  single  instruction  to  load  values from the GOT.  While this is relatively
           efficient, it only works if the GOT is smaller than about 64k.  Anything larger causes the linker  to
           report an error such as:

                   relocation truncated to fit: R_MIPS_GOT16 foobar

           If  this  happens,  you  should  recompile  your  code with <b>-mxgot</b>.  This works with very large GOTs,
           although the code is also less efficient, since it takes three instructions to fetch the value  of  a
           global symbol.

           Note  that some linkers can create multiple GOTs.  If you have such a linker, you should only need to
           use <b>-mxgot</b> when a single object file accesses more than 64k's worth of GOT entries.  Very few do.

           These options have no effect unless GCC is generating position independent code.

       <b>-mgp32</b>
           Assume that general-purpose registers are 32 bits wide.

       <b>-mgp64</b>
           Assume that general-purpose registers are 64 bits wide.

       <b>-mfp32</b>
           Assume that floating-point registers are 32 bits wide.

       <b>-mfp64</b>
           Assume that floating-point registers are 64 bits wide.

       <b>-mfpxx</b>
           Do not assume the width of floating-point registers.

       <b>-mhard-float</b>
           Use floating-point coprocessor instructions.

       <b>-msoft-float</b>
           Do not use floating-point coprocessor  instructions.   Implement  floating-point  calculations  using
           library calls instead.

       <b>-mno-float</b>
           Equivalent to <b>-msoft-float</b>, but additionally asserts that the program being compiled does not perform
           any  floating-point  operations.   This  option  is  presently supported only by some bare-metal MIPS
           configurations, where it may select a special set of libraries that lack all  floating-point  support
           (including,  for  example,  the  floating-point  "printf" formats).  If code compiled with <b>-mno-float</b>
           accidentally contains floating-point operations, it is likely  to  suffer  a  link-time  or  run-time
           failure.

       <b>-msingle-float</b>
           Assume that the floating-point coprocessor only supports single-precision operations.

       <b>-mdouble-float</b>
           Assume  that  the  floating-point  coprocessor  supports  double-precision  operations.   This is the
           default.

       <b>-modd-spreg</b>
       <b>-mno-odd-spreg</b>
           Enable the use of odd-numbered single-precision floating-point registers for the o32  ABI.   This  is
           the  default  for processors that are known to support these registers.  When using the o32 FPXX ABI,
           <b>-mno-odd-spreg</b> is set by default.

       <b>-mabs=2008</b>
       <b>-mabs=legacy</b>
           These options control the treatment of the special not-a-number (NaN) IEEE  754  floating-point  data
           with the "abs.<u>fmt</u>" and "neg.<u>fmt</u>" machine instructions.

           By  default  or  when  <b>-mabs=legacy</b>  is  used  the  legacy treatment is selected.  In this case these
           instructions are considered arithmetic and avoided where correct operation is required and the  input
           operand  might be a NaN.  A longer sequence of instructions that manipulate the sign bit of floating-
           point datum manually is used instead unless the <b>-ffinite-math-only</b> option has also been specified.

           The <b>-mabs=2008</b> option selects the IEEE 754-2008 treatment.   In  this  case  these  instructions  are
           considered  non-arithmetic  and  therefore  operating correctly in all cases, including in particular
           where the input operand is a NaN.  These instructions are therefore always used  for  the  respective
           operations.

       <b>-mnan=2008</b>
       <b>-mnan=legacy</b>
           These options control the encoding of the special not-a-number (NaN) IEEE 754 floating-point data.

           The  <b>-mnan=legacy</b> option selects the legacy encoding.  In this case quiet NaNs (qNaNs) are denoted by
           the first bit of their trailing significand field being 0, whereas signaling NaNs (sNaNs) are denoted
           by the first bit of their trailing significand field being 1.

           The <b>-mnan=2008</b> option selects the IEEE 754-2008 encoding.  In this case  qNaNs  are  denoted  by  the
           first  bit of their trailing significand field being 1, whereas sNaNs are denoted by the first bit of
           their trailing significand field being 0.

           The default is <b>-mnan=legacy</b> unless GCC has been configured with <b>--with-nan=2008</b>.

       <b>-mllsc</b>
       <b>-mno-llsc</b>
           Use (do not use) <b>ll</b>, <b>sc</b>, and <b>sync</b> instructions to implement atomic memory built-in  functions.   When
           neither option is specified, GCC uses the instructions if the target architecture supports them.

           <b>-mllsc</b>  is useful if the runtime environment can emulate the instructions and <b>-mno-llsc</b> can be useful
           when compiling for nonstandard ISAs.  You can make either option the default by configuring GCC  with
           <b>--with-llsc</b> and <b>--without-llsc</b> respectively.  <b>--with-llsc</b> is the default for some configurations; see
           the installation documentation for details.

       <b>-mdsp</b>
       <b>-mno-dsp</b>
           Use (do not use) revision 1 of the MIPS DSP ASE.
             This option defines the preprocessor macro "__mips_dsp".  It also defines "__mips_dsp_rev" to 1.

       <b>-mdspr2</b>
       <b>-mno-dspr2</b>
           Use (do not use) revision 2 of the MIPS DSP ASE.
             This  option  defines  the  preprocessor  macros  "__mips_dsp" and "__mips_dspr2".  It also defines
           "__mips_dsp_rev" to 2.

       <b>-msmartmips</b>
       <b>-mno-smartmips</b>
           Use (do not use) the MIPS SmartMIPS ASE.

       <b>-mpaired-single</b>
       <b>-mno-paired-single</b>
           Use (do not use) paired-single floating-point instructions.
             This option requires hardware floating-point support to be enabled.

       <b>-mdmx</b>
       <b>-mno-mdmx</b>
           Use (do not use) MIPS Digital Media Extension instructions.   This  option  can  only  be  used  when
           generating 64-bit code and requires hardware floating-point support to be enabled.

       <b>-mips3d</b>
       <b>-mno-mips3d</b>
           Use (do not use) the MIPS-3D ASE.  The option <b>-mips3d</b> implies <b>-mpaired-single</b>.

       <b>-mmicromips</b>
       <b>-mno-micromips</b>
           Generate (do not generate) microMIPS code.

           MicroMIPS  code generation can also be controlled on a per-function basis by means of "micromips" and
           "nomicromips" attributes.

       <b>-mmt</b>
       <b>-mno-mt</b>
           Use (do not use) MT Multithreading instructions.

       <b>-mmcu</b>
       <b>-mno-mcu</b>
           Use (do not use) the MIPS MCU ASE instructions.

       <b>-meva</b>
       <b>-mno-eva</b>
           Use (do not use) the MIPS Enhanced Virtual Addressing instructions.

       <b>-mvirt</b>
       <b>-mno-virt</b>
           Use (do not use) the MIPS Virtualization (VZ) instructions.

       <b>-mxpa</b>
       <b>-mno-xpa</b>
           Use (do not use) the MIPS eXtended Physical Address (XPA) instructions.

       <b>-mcrc</b>
       <b>-mno-crc</b>
           Use (do not use) the MIPS Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) instructions.

       <b>-mginv</b>
       <b>-mno-ginv</b>
           Use (do not use) the MIPS Global INValidate (GINV) instructions.

       <b>-mloongson-mmi</b>
       <b>-mno-loongson-mmi</b>
           Use (do not use) the MIPS Loongson MultiMedia extensions Instructions (MMI).

       <b>-mloongson-ext</b>
       <b>-mno-loongson-ext</b>
           Use (do not use) the MIPS Loongson EXTensions (EXT) instructions.

       <b>-mloongson-ext2</b>
       <b>-mno-loongson-ext2</b>
           Use (do not use) the MIPS Loongson EXTensions r2 (EXT2) instructions.

       <b>-mlong64</b>
           Force "long" types to be 64 bits wide.  See <b>-mlong32</b> for an explanation of the default  and  the  way
           that the pointer size is determined.

       <b>-mlong32</b>
           Force "long", "int", and pointer types to be 32 bits wide.

           The  default  size  of  "int"s,  "long"s and pointers depends on the ABI.  All the supported ABIs use
           32-bit "int"s.  The n64 ABI uses 64-bit "long"s, as does the  64-bit  EABI;  the  others  use  32-bit
           "long"s.   Pointers are the same size as "long"s, or the same size as integer registers, whichever is
           smaller.

       <b>-msym32</b>
       <b>-mno-sym32</b>
           Assume (do not assume) that all symbols have 32-bit values, regardless of  the  selected  ABI.   This
           option  is  useful  in  combination with <b>-mabi=64</b> and <b>-mno-abicalls</b> because it allows GCC to generate
           shorter and faster references to symbolic addresses.

       <b>-G</b> <u>num</u>
           Put definitions of externally-visible data in a small data section if that data is no bigger than <u>num</u>
           bytes.  GCC can then generate more efficient accesses to the data; see <b>-mgpopt</b> for details.

           The default <b>-G</b> option depends on the configuration.

       <b>-mlocal-sdata</b>
       <b>-mno-local-sdata</b>
           Extend (do not extend) the <b>-G</b> behavior to  local  data  too,  such  as  to  static  variables  in  C.
           <b>-mlocal-sdata</b> is the default for all configurations.

           If  the  linker  complains  that  an  application is using too much small data, you might want to try
           rebuilding the less performance-critical parts with <b>-mno-local-sdata</b>.  You might also want  to  build
           large libraries with <b>-mno-local-sdata</b>, so that the libraries leave more room for the main program.

       <b>-mextern-sdata</b>
       <b>-mno-extern-sdata</b>
           Assume  (do  not  assume) that externally-defined data is in a small data section if the size of that
           data is within the <b>-G</b> limit.  <b>-mextern-sdata</b> is the default for all configurations.

           If you compile a module <u>Mod</u> with <b>-mextern-sdata</b> <b>-G</b> <u>num</u> <b>-mgpopt</b>, and <u>Mod</u>  references  a  variable  <u>Var</u>
           that  is no bigger than <u>num</u> bytes, you must make sure that <u>Var</u> is placed in a small data section.  If
           <u>Var</u> is defined by another module, you must either compile that module with a high-enough  <b>-G</b>  setting
           or attach a "section" attribute to <u>Var</u>'s definition.  If <u>Var</u> is common, you must link the application
           with a high-enough <b>-G</b> setting.

           The easiest way of satisfying these restrictions is to compile and link every module with the same <b>-G</b>
           option.   However, you may wish to build a library that supports several different small data limits.
           You can do this by compiling the library with the highest supported <b>-G</b> setting and additionally using
           <b>-mno-extern-sdata</b> to stop the library from making assumptions about externally-defined data.

       <b>-mgpopt</b>
       <b>-mno-gpopt</b>
           Use (do not use) GP-relative accesses for symbols that are known to be in a small data  section;  see
           <b>-G</b>, <b>-mlocal-sdata</b> and <b>-mextern-sdata</b>.  <b>-mgpopt</b> is the default for all configurations.

           <b>-mno-gpopt</b>  is  useful  for  cases  where  the  $gp  register might not hold the value of "_gp".  For
           example, if the code is part of a library that might be used in a boot monitor,  programs  that  call
           boot  monitor routines pass an unknown value in $gp.  (In such situations, the boot monitor itself is
           usually compiled with <b>-G0</b>.)

           <b>-mno-gpopt</b> implies <b>-mno-local-sdata</b> and <b>-mno-extern-sdata</b>.

       <b>-membedded-data</b>
       <b>-mno-embedded-data</b>
           Allocate variables to the read-only data section first if possible,  then  next  in  the  small  data
           section  if  possible,  otherwise  in  data.   This  gives slightly slower code than the default, but
           reduces the amount of RAM required when executing, and  thus  may  be  preferred  for  some  embedded
           systems.

       <b>-muninit-const-in-rodata</b>
       <b>-mno-uninit-const-in-rodata</b>
           Put uninitialized "const" variables in the read-only data section.  This option is only meaningful in
           conjunction with <b>-membedded-data</b>.

       <b>-mcode-readable=</b><u>setting</u>
           Specify  whether GCC may generate code that reads from executable sections.  There are three possible
           settings:

           <b>-mcode-readable=yes</b>
               Instructions may freely access executable sections.  This is the default setting.

           <b>-mcode-readable=pcrel</b>
               MIPS16 PC-relative load instructions can access executable sections, but other instructions  must
               not  do  so.   This option is useful on 4KSc and 4KSd processors when the code TLBs have the Read
               Inhibit bit set.  It is also useful  on  processors  that  can  be  configured  to  have  a  dual
               instruction/data  SRAM interface and that, like the M4K, automatically redirect PC-relative loads
               to the instruction RAM.

           <b>-mcode-readable=no</b>
               Instructions must not access executable sections.  This option can be useful on targets that  are
               configured  to  have  a  dual  instruction/data  SRAM  interface but that (unlike the M4K) do not
               automatically redirect PC-relative loads to the instruction RAM.

       <b>-msplit-addresses</b>
       <b>-mno-split-addresses</b>
           Enable (disable) use of the %hi() and %lo() assembler relocation operators.   This  option  has  been
           superseded by <b>-mexplicit-relocs</b> but is retained for backwards compatibility.

       <b>-mexplicit-relocs</b>
       <b>-mno-explicit-relocs</b>
           Use  (do  not  use)  assembler  relocation  operators  when  dealing  with  symbolic  addresses.  The
           alternative, selected by <b>-mno-explicit-relocs</b>, is to use assembler macros instead.

           <b>-mexplicit-relocs</b> is the default if GCC was configured to use an assembler that  supports  relocation
           operators.

       <b>-mcheck-zero-division</b>
       <b>-mno-check-zero-division</b>
           Trap (do not trap) on integer division by zero.

           The default is <b>-mcheck-zero-division</b>.

       <b>-mdivide-traps</b>
       <b>-mdivide-breaks</b>
           MIPS  systems  check  for  division  by  zero  by  generating  either  a  conditional trap or a break
           instruction.  Using traps results in smaller code, but is only supported on MIPS II and later.  Also,
           some versions of the Linux kernel have a bug that prevents trap from  generating  the  proper  signal
           ("SIGFPE").   Use  <b>-mdivide-traps</b>  to  allow conditional traps on architectures that support them and
           <b>-mdivide-breaks</b> to force the use of breaks.

           The default  is  usually  <b>-mdivide-traps</b>,  but  this  can  be  overridden  at  configure  time  using
           <b>--with-divide=breaks</b>.      Divide-by-zero     checks     can    be    completely    disabled    using
           <b>-mno-check-zero-division</b>.

       <b>-mload-store-pairs</b>
       <b>-mno-load-store-pairs</b>
           Enable (disable) an optimization  that  pairs  consecutive  load  or  store  instructions  to  enable
           load/store  bonding.   This  option  is  enabled  by  default but only takes effect when the selected
           architecture is known to support bonding.

       <b>-mmemcpy</b>
       <b>-mno-memcpy</b>
           Force (do not force) the use of "memcpy" for non-trivial block moves.  The  default  is  <b>-mno-memcpy</b>,
           which allows GCC to inline most constant-sized copies.

       <b>-mlong-calls</b>
       <b>-mno-long-calls</b>
           Disable  (do  not  disable)  use  of  the  "jal"  instruction.  Calling functions using "jal" is more
           efficient but requires the caller and callee to be in the same 256 megabyte segment.

           This option has no effect on abicalls code.  The default is <b>-mno-long-calls</b>.

       <b>-mmad</b>
       <b>-mno-mad</b>
           Enable (disable) use of the "mad", "madu" and "mul" instructions, as provided by the R4650 ISA.

       <b>-mimadd</b>
       <b>-mno-imadd</b>
           Enable (disable) use of the "madd" and "msub"  integer  instructions.   The  default  is  <b>-mimadd</b>  on
           architectures  that  support  "madd" and "msub" except for the 74k architecture where it was found to
           generate slower code.

       <b>-mfused-madd</b>
       <b>-mno-fused-madd</b>
           Enable (disable) use of the floating-point multiply-accumulate instructions, when they are available.
           The default is <b>-mfused-madd</b>.

           On the R8000 CPU  when  multiply-accumulate  instructions  are  used,  the  intermediate  product  is
           calculated  to  infinite  precision  and  is  not subject to the FCSR Flush to Zero bit.  This may be
           undesirable in some circumstances.  On other processors the result is numerically  identical  to  the
           equivalent computation using separate multiply, add, subtract and negate instructions.

       <b>-nocpp</b>
           Tell the MIPS assembler to not run its preprocessor over user assembler files (with a <b>.s</b> suffix) when
           assembling them.

       <b>-mfix-24k</b>
       <b>-mno-fix-24k</b>
           Work  around the 24K E48 (lost data on stores during refill) errata.  The workarounds are implemented
           by the assembler rather than by GCC.

       <b>-mfix-r4000</b>
       <b>-mno-fix-r4000</b>
           Work around certain R4000 CPU errata:

           -   A double-word or a variable shift may give an incorrect  result  if  executed  immediately  after
               starting an integer division.

           -   A  double-word  or  a  variable  shift  may give an incorrect result if executed while an integer
               multiplication is in progress.

           -   An integer division may give an incorrect result if started in a delay slot of a taken branch  or
               a jump.

       <b>-mfix-r4400</b>
       <b>-mno-fix-r4400</b>
           Work around certain R4400 CPU errata:

           -   A  double-word  or  a  variable  shift may give an incorrect result if executed immediately after
               starting an integer division.

       <b>-mfix-r10000</b>
       <b>-mno-fix-r10000</b>
           Work around certain R10000 errata:

           -   "ll"/"sc" sequences may not behave atomically on revisions prior to 3.0.  They  may  deadlock  on
               revisions 2.6 and earlier.

           This  option  can  only  be  used  if  the  target  architecture supports branch-likely instructions.
           <b>-mfix-r10000</b> is the default when <b>-march=r10000</b> is used; <b>-mno-fix-r10000</b> is the default otherwise.

       <b>-mfix-r5900</b>
       <b>-mno-fix-r5900</b>
           Do not attempt to schedule the preceding instruction into the delay  slot  of  a  branch  instruction
           placed  at  the  end  of  a  short  loop  of  six  instructions  or fewer and always schedule a "nop"
           instruction there instead.  The short loop bug under certain conditions causes loops to execute  only
           once  or  twice,  due  to  a  hardware  bug  in the R5900 chip.  The workaround is implemented by the
           assembler rather than by GCC.

       <b>-mfix-rm7000</b>
       <b>-mno-fix-rm7000</b>
           Work around the RM7000 "dmult"/"dmultu" errata.  The workarounds are  implemented  by  the  assembler
           rather than by GCC.

       <b>-mfix-vr4120</b>
       <b>-mno-fix-vr4120</b>
           Work around certain VR4120 errata:

           -   "dmultu" does not always produce the correct result.

           -   "div" and "ddiv" do not always produce the correct result if one of the operands is negative.

           The  workarounds  for  the  division errata rely on special functions in <u>libgcc.a</u>.  At present, these
           functions are only provided by the "mips64vr*-elf" configurations.

           Other VR4120 errata require a NOP to be inserted between certain pairs of instructions.  These errata
           are handled by the assembler, not by GCC itself.

       <b>-mfix-vr4130</b>
           Work around the VR4130 "mflo"/"mfhi" errata.  The workarounds are implemented by the assembler rather
           than by GCC, although GCC avoids using "mflo" and "mfhi" if the VR4130 "macc", "macchi", "dmacc"  and
           "dmacchi" instructions are available instead.

       <b>-mfix-sb1</b>
       <b>-mno-fix-sb1</b>
           Work around certain SB-1 CPU core errata.  (This flag currently works around the SB-1 revision 2 "F1"
           and "F2" floating-point errata.)

       <b>-mr10k-cache-barrier=</b><u>setting</u>
           Specify  whether  GCC  should  insert cache barriers to avoid the side effects of speculation on R10K
           processors.

           In common with many processors, the R10K tries to predict the outcome of  a  conditional  branch  and
           speculatively  executes  instructions from the "taken" branch.  It later aborts these instructions if
           the predicted outcome is wrong.  However, on the  R10K,  even  aborted  instructions  can  have  side
           effects.

           This problem only affects kernel stores and, depending on the system, kernel loads.  As an example, a
           speculatively-executed  store may load the target memory into cache and mark the cache line as dirty,
           even if the store itself is later aborted.  If a DMA operation writes to  the  same  area  of  memory
           before  the  "dirty"  line  is  flushed,  the  cached  data overwrites the DMA-ed data.  See the R10K
           processor manual for a full description, including other potential problems.

           One workaround is to insert cache barrier instructions before  every  memory  access  that  might  be
           speculatively    executed    and    that    might    have    side    effects    even    if   aborted.
           <b>-mr10k-cache-barrier=</b><u>setting</u> controls GCC's implementation  of  this  workaround.   It  assumes  that
           aborted accesses to any byte in the following regions does not have side effects:

           1.  the memory occupied by the current function's stack frame;

           2.  the memory occupied by an incoming stack argument;

           3.  the memory occupied by an object with a link-time-constant address.

           It  is  the  kernel's  responsibility to ensure that speculative accesses to these regions are indeed
           safe.

           If the input program contains a function declaration such as:

                   void foo (void);

           then the implementation of "foo" must allow "j foo" and "jal foo" to be executed speculatively.   GCC
           honors  this  restriction  for  functions  it compiles itself.  It expects non-GCC functions (such as
           hand-written assembly code) to do the same.

           The option has three forms:

           <b>-mr10k-cache-barrier=load-store</b>
               Insert a cache barrier before a load or store that might be speculatively executed and that might
               have side effects even if aborted.

           <b>-mr10k-cache-barrier=store</b>
               Insert a cache barrier before a store that might be speculatively executed and  that  might  have
               side effects even if aborted.

           <b>-mr10k-cache-barrier=none</b>
               Disable the insertion of cache barriers.  This is the default setting.

       <b>-mflush-func=</b><u>func</u>
       <b>-mno-flush-func</b>
           Specifies  the  function  to  call to flush the I and D caches, or to not call any such function.  If
           called, the function must take the same arguments as the common "_flush_func", that is,  the  address
           of  the  memory  range  for  which  the cache is being flushed, the size of the memory range, and the
           number 3 (to flush both caches).  The default depends on the  target  GCC  was  configured  for,  but
           commonly is either "_flush_func" or "__cpu_flush".

       <b>mbranch-cost=</b><u>num</u>
           Set  the cost of branches to roughly <u>num</u> "simple" instructions.  This cost is only a heuristic and is
           not guaranteed to produce consistent results across releases.  A zero cost  redundantly  selects  the
           default, which is based on the <b>-mtune</b> setting.

       <b>-mbranch-likely</b>
       <b>-mno-branch-likely</b>
           Enable  or  disable  use  of  Branch  Likely instructions, regardless of the default for the selected
           architecture.  By default, Branch Likely instructions may be generated if they are supported  by  the
           selected  architecture.   An exception is for the MIPS32 and MIPS64 architectures and processors that
           implement those architectures; for those, Branch Likely instructions are not be generated by  default
           because the MIPS32 and MIPS64 architectures specifically deprecate their use.

       <b>-mcompact-branches=never</b>
       <b>-mcompact-branches=optimal</b>
       <b>-mcompact-branches=always</b>
           These   options   control   which   form   of   branches   will   be   generated.    The  default  is
           <b>-mcompact-branches=optimal</b>.

           The <b>-mcompact-branches=never</b> option ensures that compact branch instructions will never be generated.

           The <b>-mcompact-branches=always</b> option ensures that a compact branch instruction will be  generated  if
           available.  If a compact branch instruction is not available, a delay slot form of the branch will be
           used instead.

           This option is supported from MIPS Release 6 onwards.

           The  <b>-mcompact-branches=optimal</b>  option will cause a delay slot branch to be used if one is available
           in the current ISA and the delay slot is successfully filled.  If the delay slot  is  not  filled,  a
           compact branch will be chosen if one is available.

       <b>-mfp-exceptions</b>
       <b>-mno-fp-exceptions</b>
           Specifies whether FP exceptions are enabled.  This affects how FP instructions are scheduled for some
           processors.  The default is that FP exceptions are enabled.

           For  instance,  on  the SB-1, if FP exceptions are disabled, and we are emitting 64-bit code, then we
           can use both FP pipes.  Otherwise, we can only use one FP pipe.

       <b>-mvr4130-align</b>
       <b>-mno-vr4130-align</b>
           The VR4130 pipeline is two-way superscalar, but can only issue two instructions together if the first
           one is 8-byte aligned.  When this option is enabled, GCC aligns pairs of instructions that it  thinks
           should execute in parallel.

           This option only has an effect when optimizing for the VR4130.  It normally makes code faster, but at
           the expense of making it bigger.  It is enabled by default at optimization level <b>-O3</b>.

       <b>-msynci</b>
       <b>-mno-synci</b>
           Enable  (disable)  generation  of "synci" instructions on architectures that support it.  The "synci"
           instructions (if enabled) are generated when "__builtin___clear_cache" is compiled.

           This option defaults to <b>-mno-synci</b>, but the  default  can  be  overridden  by  configuring  GCC  with
           <b>--with-synci</b>.

           When  compiling  code for single processor systems, it is generally safe to use "synci".  However, on
           many multi-core (SMP) systems, it does not invalidate the instruction caches on  all  cores  and  may
           lead to undefined behavior.

       <b>-mrelax-pic-calls</b>
       <b>-mno-relax-pic-calls</b>
           Try  to turn PIC calls that are normally dispatched via register $25 into direct calls.  This is only
           possible if the linker can resolve the destination at link time and  if  the  destination  is  within
           range for a direct call.

           <b>-mrelax-pic-calls</b>  is the default if GCC was configured to use an assembler and a linker that support
           the ".reloc" assembly directive and <b>-mexplicit-relocs</b> is in effect.  With <b>-mno-explicit-relocs</b>,  this
           optimization can be performed by the assembler and the linker alone without help from the compiler.

       <b>-mmcount-ra-address</b>
       <b>-mno-mcount-ra-address</b>
           Emit  (do not emit) code that allows "_mcount" to modify the calling function's return address.  When
           enabled, this option extends the usual "_mcount" interface with a new <u>ra-address</u> parameter, which has
           type "intptr_t *" and is passed in register $12.  "_mcount" can then modify  the  return  address  by
           doing both of the following:

           *   Returning the new address in register $31.

           *   Storing the new address in "*<u>ra-address</u>", if <u>ra-address</u> is nonnull.

           The default is <b>-mno-mcount-ra-address</b>.

       <b>-mframe-header-opt</b>
       <b>-mno-frame-header-opt</b>
           Enable (disable) frame header optimization in the o32 ABI.  When using the o32 ABI, calling functions
           will  allocate  16  bytes on the stack for the called function to write out register arguments.  When
           enabled, this optimization will suppress the allocation of the frame header if it can  be  determined
           that it is unused.

           This optimization is off by default at all optimization levels.

       <b>-mlxc1-sxc1</b>
       <b>-mno-lxc1-sxc1</b>
           When  applicable, enable (disable) the generation of "lwxc1", "swxc1", "ldxc1", "sdxc1" instructions.
           Enabled by default.

       <b>-mmadd4</b>
       <b>-mno-madd4</b>
           When applicable, enable  (disable)  the  generation  of  4-operand  "madd.s",  "madd.d"  and  related
           instructions.  Enabled by default.

           Specify  that  intrinsic  library  functions  are being compiled, passing all values in registers, no
           matter the size.

       <b>-mepsilon</b>
       <b>-mno-epsilon</b>
           Generate floating-point comparison instructions  that  compare  with  respect  to  the  "rE"  epsilon
           register.

       <b>-mabi=mmixware</b>
       <b>-mabi=gnu</b>
           Generate  code  that  passes  function parameters and return values that (in the called function) are
           seen as registers $0 and up, as opposed to the GNU ABI which uses global registers $231 and up.

       <b>-mzero-extend</b>
       <b>-mno-zero-extend</b>
           When reading data from memory in sizes shorter than 64 bits, use (do  not  use)  zero-extending  load
           instructions by default, rather than sign-extending ones.

       <b>-mknuthdiv</b>
       <b>-mno-knuthdiv</b>
           Make  the  result  of  a  division  yielding a remainder have the same sign as the divisor.  With the
           default, <b>-mno-knuthdiv</b>, the sign of the remainder follows the sign of the dividend.  Both methods are
           arithmetically valid, the latter being almost exclusively used.

       <b>-mtoplevel-symbols</b>
       <b>-mno-toplevel-symbols</b>
           Prepend (do not prepend) a <b>:</b> to all global symbols, so  the  assembly  code  can  be  used  with  the
           "PREFIX" assembly directive.

       <b>-melf</b>
           Generate  an  executable  in  the  ELF  format,  rather  than the default <b>mmo</b> format used by the <b>mmix</b>
           simulator.

       <b>-mbranch-predict</b>
       <b>-mno-branch-predict</b>
           Use (do not use) the probable-branch instructions, when static branch prediction indicates a probable
           branch.

       <b>-mbase-addresses</b>
       <b>-mno-base-addresses</b>
           Generate (do not generate) code that  uses  <u>base</u>  <u>addresses</u>.   Using  a  base  address  automatically
           generates a request (handled by the assembler and the linker) for a constant to be set up in a global
           register.   The register is used for one or more base address requests within the range 0 to 255 from
           the value held in the register.  The generally leads to short  and  fast  code,  but  the  number  of
           different  data  items that can be addressed is limited.  This means that a program that uses lots of
           static data may require <b>-mno-base-addresses</b>.

       <b>-msingle-exit</b>
       <b>-mno-single-exit</b>
           Force (do not force) generated code to have a single exit point in each function.

       <u>MN10300</u> <u>Options</u>

       These <b>-m</b> options are defined for Matsushita MN10300 architectures:

       <b>-mmult-bug</b>
           Generate code to avoid bugs in the multiply instructions for the MN10300  processors.   This  is  the
           default.

       <b>-mno-mult-bug</b>
           Do not generate code to avoid bugs in the multiply instructions for the MN10300 processors.

       <b>-mam33</b>
           Generate code using features specific to the AM33 processor.

       <b>-mno-am33</b>
           Do not generate code using features specific to the AM33 processor.  This is the default.

       <b>-mam33-2</b>
           Generate code using features specific to the AM33/2.0 processor.

       <b>-mam34</b>
           Generate code using features specific to the AM34 processor.

       <b>-mtune=</b><u>cpu-type</u>
           Use the timing characteristics of the indicated CPU type when scheduling instructions.  This does not
           change the targeted processor type.  The CPU type must be one of <b>mn10300</b>, <b>am33</b>, <b>am33-2</b> or <b>am34</b>.

       <b>-mreturn-pointer-on-d0</b>
           When  generating  a  function  that  returns  a  pointer,  return  the pointer in both "a0" and "d0".
           Otherwise, the pointer is returned only in "a0", and  attempts  to  call  such  functions  without  a
           prototype result in errors.  Note that this option is on by default; use <b>-mno-return-pointer-on-d0</b> to
           disable it.

       <b>-mno-crt0</b>
           Do not link in the C run-time initialization object file.

       <b>-mrelax</b>
           Indicate  to  the  linker  that it should perform a relaxation optimization pass to shorten branches,
           calls and absolute memory addresses.  This option only has an effect when used on  the  command  line
           for the final link step.

           This option makes symbolic debugging impossible.

       <b>-mliw</b>
           Allow the compiler to generate <u>Long</u> <u>Instruction</u> <u>Word</u> instructions if the target is the <b>AM33</b> or later.
           This is the default.  This option defines the preprocessor macro "__LIW__".

       <b>-mno-liw</b>
           Do  not  allow  the compiler to generate <u>Long</u> <u>Instruction</u> <u>Word</u> instructions.  This option defines the
           preprocessor macro "__NO_LIW__".

       <b>-msetlb</b>
           Allow the compiler to generate the <u>SETLB</u> and <u>Lcc</u> instructions if the target is  the  <b>AM33</b>  or  later.
           This is the default.  This option defines the preprocessor macro "__SETLB__".

       <b>-mno-setlb</b>
           Do  not  allow  the  compiler  to  generate  <u>SETLB</u>  or  <u>Lcc</u>  instructions.   This  option defines the
           preprocessor macro "__NO_SETLB__".

       <u>Moxie</u> <u>Options</u>

       <b>-meb</b>
           Generate big-endian code.  This is the default for <b>moxie-*-*</b> configurations.

       <b>-mel</b>
           Generate little-endian code.

       <b>-mmul.x</b>
           Generate mul.x and umul.x instructions.  This is the default for <b>moxiebox-*-*</b> configurations.

       <b>-mno-crt0</b>
           Do not link in the C run-time initialization object file.

       <u>MSP430</u> <u>Options</u>

       These options are defined for the MSP430:

       <b>-masm-hex</b>
           Force assembly output to always use hex constants.  Normally such constants are signed decimals,  but
           this option is available for testsuite and/or aesthetic purposes.

       <b>-mmcu=</b>
           Select  the  MCU  to target.  This is used to create a C preprocessor symbol based upon the MCU name,
           converted to upper case and pre- and post-fixed with <b>__</b>.  This in turn is used by the <u>msp430.h</u> header
           file to select an MCU-specific supplementary header file.

           The option also sets the ISA to use.  If the MCU name is one that is known to only  support  the  430
           ISA then that is selected, otherwise the 430X ISA is selected.  A generic MCU name of <b>msp430</b> can also
           be used to select the 430 ISA.  Similarly the generic <b>msp430x</b> MCU name selects the 430X ISA.

           In  addition an MCU-specific linker script is added to the linker command line.  The script's name is
           the name of the MCU with <u>.ld</u> appended.  Thus specifying <b>-mmcu=xxx</b> on the <b>gcc</b> command line defines the
           C preprocessor symbol "__XXX__" and cause the linker to search for a script called <u>xxx.ld</u>.

           The ISA and hardware multiply supported for the different MCUs is hard-coded into GCC.   However,  an
           external  <b>devices.csv</b>  file  can  be  used to extend device support beyond those that have been hard-
           coded.

           GCC searches for the <b>devices.csv</b> file using the following methods  in  the  given  precedence  order,
           where the first method takes precendence over the second which takes precedence over the third.

           Include path specified with "-I" and "-L"
               <b>devices.csv</b> will be searched for in each of the directories specified by include paths and linker
               library search paths.

           Path specified by the environment variable <b>MSP430_GCC_INCLUDE_DIR</b>
               Define  the  value  of the global environment variable <b>MSP430_GCC_INCLUDE_DIR</b> to the full path to
               the directory containing devices.csv, and GCC will search this  directory  for  devices.csv.   If
               devices.csv  is  found,  this  directory  will  also be registered as an include path, and linker
               library path.  Header files and linker scripts in this directory can therefore  be  used  without
               manually specifying "-I" and "-L" on the command line.

           The <b>msp430-elf{,bare}/include/devices</b> directory
               Finally,  GCC  will  examine <b>msp430-elf{,bare}/include/devices</b> from the toolchain root directory.
               This directory does not exist in a default installation, but if  the  user  has  created  it  and
               copied  <b>devices.csv</b> there, then the MCU data will be read.  As above, this directory will also be
               registered as an include path, and linker library path.

           If none of the above search methods find <b>devices.csv</b>, then the hard-coded MCU data is used.

       <b>-mwarn-mcu</b>
       <b>-mno-warn-mcu</b>
           This option enables or disables warnings about conflicts between the MCU name specified by the  <b>-mmcu</b>
           option  and  the ISA set by the <b>-mcpu</b> option and/or the hardware multiply support set by the <b>-mhwmult</b>
           option.  It also toggles warnings about unrecognized MCU names.  This option is on by default.

       <b>-mcpu=</b>
           Specifies the ISA to use.  Accepted values  are  <b>msp430</b>,  <b>msp430x</b>  and  <b>msp430xv2</b>.   This  option  is
           deprecated.  The <b>-mmcu=</b> option should be used to select the ISA.

       <b>-msim</b>
           Link  to  the  simulator  runtime  libraries  and linker script.  Overrides any scripts that would be
           selected by the <b>-mmcu=</b> option.

       <b>-mlarge</b>
           Use large-model addressing (20-bit pointers, 20-bit "size_t").

       <b>-msmall</b>
           Use small-model addressing (16-bit pointers, 16-bit "size_t").

       <b>-mrelax</b>
           This option is passed to the  assembler  and  linker,  and  allows  the  linker  to  perform  certain
           optimizations that cannot be done until the final link.

       <b>mhwmult=</b>
           Describes  the  type  of  hardware multiply supported by the target.  Accepted values are <b>none</b> for no
           hardware multiply, <b>16bit</b> for the original 16-bit-only multiply supported by early  MCUs.   <b>32bit</b>  for
           the  16/32-bit  multiply supported by later MCUs and <b>f5series</b> for the 16/32-bit multiply supported by
           F5-series MCUs.  A value of <b>auto</b> can also be given.  This tells GCC to deduce the  hardware  multiply
           support  based upon the MCU name provided by the <b>-mmcu</b> option.  If no <b>-mmcu</b> option is specified or if
           the MCU name is not recognized then no hardware multiply support is assumed.  "auto" is  the  default
           setting.

           Hardware  multiplies  are  normally  performed by calling a library routine.  This saves space in the
           generated code.  When compiling at <b>-O3</b> or higher however the hardware multiplier is  invoked  inline.
           This makes for bigger, but faster code.

           The  hardware  multiply routines disable interrupts whilst running and restore the previous interrupt
           state when they finish.  This makes them safe to use inside interrupt handlers as well as  in  normal
           code.

       <b>-minrt</b>
           Enable  the  use  of a minimum runtime environment - no static initializers or constructors.  This is
           intended for memory-constrained devices.  The compiler includes special symbols in some objects  that
           tell the linker and runtime which code fragments are required.

       <b>-mtiny-printf</b>
           Enable  reduced  code  size "printf" and "puts" library functions.  The <b>tiny</b> implementations of these
           functions are not reentrant, so must be used with caution in multi-threaded applications.

           Support for streams has been removed and the string to be printed will always be sent to  stdout  via
           the "write" syscall.  The string is not buffered before it is sent to write.

           This     option    requires    Newlib    Nano    IO,    so    GCC    must    be    configured    with
           <b>--enable-newlib-nano-formatted-io</b>.

       <b>-mmax-inline-shift=</b>
           This option takes an integer between 0 and 64 inclusive, and sets the maximum number of inline  shift
           instructions  which  should  be emitted to perform a shift operation by a constant amount.  When this
           value needs to be exceeded, an mspabi helper function is used instead.  The default value is 4.

           This only affects cases where a shift by  multiple  positions  cannot  be  completed  with  a  single
           instruction (e.g. all shifts &gt;1 on the 430 ISA).

           Shifts of a 32-bit value are at least twice as costly, so the value passed for this option is divided
           by 2 and the resulting value used instead.

       <b>-mcode-region=</b>
       <b>-mdata-region=</b>
           These  options  tell  the  compiler  where  to  place  functions and data that do not have one of the
           "lower", "upper", "either" or "section" attributes.  Possible values are "lower",  "upper",  "either"
           or  "any".   The  first  three  behave like the corresponding attribute.  The fourth possible value -
           "any" - is the default.  It leaves placement entirely up to the linker script and how it assigns  the
           standard sections (".text", ".data", etc) to the memory regions.

       <b>-msilicon-errata=</b>
           This option passes on a request to assembler to enable the fixes for the named silicon errata.

       <b>-msilicon-errata-warn=</b>
           This  option  passes  on  a request to the assembler to enable warning messages when a silicon errata
           might need to be applied.

       <b>-mwarn-devices-csv</b>
       <b>-mno-warn-devices-csv</b>
           Warn if <b>devices.csv</b> is not found or there are problem parsing it (default: on).

       <u>NDS32</u> <u>Options</u>

       These options are defined for NDS32 implementations:

       <b>-mbig-endian</b>
           Generate code in big-endian mode.

       <b>-mcache-block-size=</b><u>num</u>
           Specify the size of each cache block, which must be a power of 2 between 4 and 512.

       <b>-march=</b><u>arch</u>
           Specify the name of the target architecture.

       <b>-mcmodel=</b><u>code-model</u>
           Set the code model to one of

           <b>small</b>
               All the data and read-only data segments must be within 512KB addressing space.  The text segment
               must be within 16MB addressing space.

           <b>medium</b>
               The data segment must be within 512KB  while  the  read-only  data  segment  can  be  within  4GB
               addressing space.  The text segment should be still within 16MB addressing space.

       <b>-mrelax</b>
           Guide linker to relax instructions.

       <u>Nios</u> <u>II</u> <u>Options</u>

       These are the options defined for the Altera Nios II processor.

       <b>-G</b> <u>num</u>
           Put  global  and  static  objects less than or equal to <u>num</u> bytes into the small data or BSS sections
           instead of the normal data or BSS sections.  The default value of <u>num</u> is 8.

       <b>-mgpopt=</b><u>option</u>
       <b>-mgpopt</b>
       <b>-mno-gpopt</b>
           Generate (do not generate) GP-relative accesses.  The following <u>option</u> names are recognized:

           <b>none</b>
               Do not generate GP-relative accesses.

           <b>local</b>
               Generate  GP-relative  accesses  for  small  data  objects  that  are  not  external,  weak,   or
               uninitialized  common  symbols.   Also  use  GP-relative  addressing  for  objects that have been
               explicitly placed in a small data section via a "section" attribute.

           <b>global</b>
               As for <b>local</b>, but also generate GP-relative accesses for small data objects  that  are  external,
               weak,  or  common.   If  you  use  this  option,  you  must ensure that all parts of your program
               (including libraries) are compiled with the same <b>-G</b> setting.

           <b>data</b>
               Generate GP-relative accesses for all data objects in the program.  If you use this  option,  the
               entire  data  and  BSS  segments  of  your  program must fit in 64K of memory and you must use an
               appropriate linker script to allocate them within the addressable range of the global pointer.

           <b>all</b> Generate GP-relative addresses for function pointers as well as data pointers.  If you  use  this
               option, the entire text, data, and BSS segments of your program must fit in 64K of memory and you
               must use an appropriate linker script to allocate them within the addressable range of the global
               pointer.

           <b>-mgpopt</b> is equivalent to <b>-mgpopt=local</b>, and <b>-mno-gpopt</b> is equivalent to <b>-mgpopt=none</b>.

           The default is <b>-mgpopt</b> except when <b>-fpic</b> or <b>-fPIC</b> is specified to generate position-independent code.
           Note that the Nios II ABI does not permit GP-relative accesses from shared libraries.

           You  may  need  to specify <b>-mno-gpopt</b> explicitly when building programs that include large amounts of
           small data, including large GOT data sections.  In this  case,  the  16-bit  offset  for  GP-relative
           addressing may not be large enough to allow access to the entire small data section.

       <b>-mgprel-sec=</b><u>regexp</u>
           This  option  specifies additional section names that can be accessed via GP-relative addressing.  It
           is most useful in conjunction with "section" attributes on variable declarations and a custom  linker
           script.  The <u>regexp</u> is a POSIX Extended Regular Expression.

           This option does not affect the behavior of the <b>-G</b> option, and the specified sections are in addition
           to the standard ".sdata" and ".sbss" small-data sections that are recognized by <b>-mgpopt</b>.

       <b>-mr0rel-sec=</b><u>regexp</u>
           This  option specifies names of sections that can be accessed via a 16-bit offset from "r0"; that is,
           in the low 32K or high 32K of the 32-bit address space.   It  is  most  useful  in  conjunction  with
           "section"  attributes  on  variable  declarations  and a custom linker script.  The <u>regexp</u> is a POSIX
           Extended Regular Expression.

           In contrast to the use of GP-relative addressing for  small  data,  zero-based  addressing  is  never
           generated  by default and there are no conventional section names used in standard linker scripts for
           sections in the low or high areas of memory.

       <b>-mel</b>
       <b>-meb</b>
           Generate little-endian (default) or big-endian (experimental) code, respectively.

       <b>-march=</b><u>arch</u>
           This specifies the name of the target Nios II architecture.  GCC uses this  name  to  determine  what
           kind of instructions it can emit when generating assembly code.  Permissible names are: <b>r1</b>, <b>r2</b>.

           The  preprocessor  macro "__nios2_arch__" is available to programs, with value 1 or 2, indicating the
           targeted ISA level.

       <b>-mbypass-cache</b>
       <b>-mno-bypass-cache</b>
           Force all load and  store  instructions  to  always  bypass  cache  by  using  I/O  variants  of  the
           instructions. The default is not to bypass the cache.

       <b>-mno-cache-volatile</b>
       <b>-mcache-volatile</b>
           Volatile  memory  access  bypass the cache using the I/O variants of the load and store instructions.
           The default is not to bypass the cache.

       <b>-mno-fast-sw-div</b>
       <b>-mfast-sw-div</b>
           Do not use table-based fast divide for small numbers. The default is to use the fast  divide  at  <b>-O3</b>
           and above.

       <b>-mno-hw-mul</b>
       <b>-mhw-mul</b>
       <b>-mno-hw-mulx</b>
       <b>-mhw-mulx</b>
       <b>-mno-hw-div</b>
       <b>-mhw-div</b>
           Enable  or  disable  emitting  "mul",  "mulx"  and  "div" family of instructions by the compiler. The
           default is to emit "mul" and not emit "div" and "mulx".

       <b>-mbmx</b>
       <b>-mno-bmx</b>
       <b>-mcdx</b>
       <b>-mno-cdx</b>
           Enable or  disable  generation  of  Nios  II  R2  BMX  (bit  manipulation)  and  CDX  (code  density)
           instructions.   Enabling  these  instructions  also requires <b>-march=r2</b>.  Since these instructions are
           optional extensions to the R2 architecture, the default is not to emit them.

       <b>-mcustom-</b><u>insn</u><b>=</b><u>N</u>
       <b>-mno-custom-</b><u>insn</u>
           Each <b>-mcustom-</b><u>insn</u><b>=</b><u>N</u> option enables use of a custom instruction with encoding <u>N</u> when generating  code
           that  uses  <u>insn</u>.   For  example,  <b>-mcustom-fadds=253</b>  generates  custom  instruction 253 for single-
           precision floating-point add operations instead of the default behavior of using a library call.

           The following values of <u>insn</u> are supported.  Except as otherwise noted, floating-point operations are
           expected to be implemented with normal IEEE 754 semantics and correspond directly to the C  operators
           or the equivalent GCC built-in functions.

           Single-precision floating point:

           <b>fadds</b>, <b>fsubs</b>, <b>fdivs</b>, <b>fmuls</b>
               Binary arithmetic operations.

           <b>fnegs</b>
               Unary negation.

               Comparison operations.

           <b>fmins</b>, <b>fmaxs</b>
               Floating-point  minimum and maximum.  These instructions are only generated if <b>-ffinite-math-only</b>
               is specified.

           <b>fsqrts</b>
               Unary square root operation.

           <b>fcoss</b>, <b>fsins</b>, <b>ftans</b>, <b>fatans</b>, <b>fexps</b>, <b>flogs</b>
               Floating-point trigonometric and exponential functions.  These instructions are only generated if
               <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations</b> is also specified.

           Double-precision floating point:

           <b>faddd</b>, <b>fsubd</b>, <b>fdivd</b>, <b>fmuld</b>
               Binary arithmetic operations.

           <b>fnegd</b>
               Unary negation.

           <b>fabsd</b>
               Unary absolute value.

           <b>fcmpeqd</b>, <b>fcmpged</b>, <b>fcmpgtd</b>, <b>fcmpled</b>, <b>fcmpltd</b>, <b>fcmpned</b>
               Comparison operations.

           <b>fmind</b>, <b>fmaxd</b>
               Double-precision   minimum   and   maximum.    These   instructions   are   only   generated   if
               <b>-ffinite-math-only</b> is specified.

           <b>fsqrtd</b>
               Unary square root operation.

           <b>fcosd</b>, <b>fsind</b>, <b>ftand</b>, <b>fatand</b>, <b>fexpd</b>, <b>flogd</b>
               Double-precision  trigonometric and exponential functions.  These instructions are only generated
               if <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations</b> is also specified.

           Conversions:

           <b>fextsd</b>
               Conversion from single precision to double precision.

           <b>ftruncds</b>
               Conversion from double precision to single precision.

           <b>fixsi</b>, <b>fixsu</b>, <b>fixdi</b>, <b>fixdu</b>
               Conversion from floating point to signed or unsigned integer types, with truncation towards zero.

           <b>round</b>
               Conversion from single-precision floating point  to  signed  integer,  rounding  to  the  nearest
               integer  and  ties  away  from  zero.   This corresponds to the "__builtin_lroundf" function when
               <b>-fno-math-errno</b> is used.

           <b>floatis</b>, <b>floatus</b>, <b>floatid</b>, <b>floatud</b>
               Conversion from signed or unsigned integer types to floating-point types.

           In addition, all of the following transfer instructions for  internal  registers  X  and  Y  must  be
           provided  to use any of the double-precision floating-point instructions.  Custom instructions taking
           two double-precision source operands expect the first operand in the 64-bit register  X.   The  other
           operand (or only operand of a unary operation) is given to the custom arithmetic instruction with the
           least  significant  half  in  source  register  <u>src1</u> and the most significant half in <u>src2</u>.  A custom
           instruction that returns a double-precision result returns  the  most  significant  32  bits  in  the
           destination  register  and  the  other  half  in  32-bit register Y.  GCC automatically generates the
           necessary code sequences to write register X and/or read register Y when  double-precision  floating-
           point instructions are used.

           <b>fwrx</b>
               Write <u>src1</u> into the least significant half of X and <u>src2</u> into the most significant half of X.

           <b>fwry</b>
               Write <u>src1</u> into Y.

           <b>frdxhi</b>, <b>frdxlo</b>
               Read the most or least (respectively) significant half of X and store it in <u>dest</u>.

           <b>frdy</b>
               Read the value of Y and store it into <u>dest</u>.

           Note that you can gain more local control over generation of Nios II custom instructions by using the
           target("custom-<u>insn</u>=<u>N</u>") and target("no-custom-<u>insn</u>") function attributes or pragmas.

       <b>-mcustom-fpu-cfg=</b><u>name</u>
           This  option  enables  a  predefined,  named  set  of custom instruction encodings (see <b>-mcustom-</b><u>insn</u>
           above).  Currently, the following sets are defined:

           <b>-mcustom-fpu-cfg=60-1</b> is  equivalent  to:  <b>-mcustom-fmuls=252</b>  <b>-mcustom-fadds=253</b>  <b>-mcustom-fsubs=254</b>
           <b>-fsingle-precision-constant</b>

           <b>-mcustom-fpu-cfg=60-2</b>  is  equivalent  to:  <b>-mcustom-fmuls=252</b>  <b>-mcustom-fadds=253</b> <b>-mcustom-fsubs=254</b>
           <b>-mcustom-fdivs=255</b> <b>-fsingle-precision-constant</b>

           <b>-mcustom-fpu-cfg=72-3</b> is equivalent to: <b>-mcustom-floatus=243</b> <b>-mcustom-fixsi=244</b>  <b>-mcustom-floatis=245</b>
           <b>-mcustom-fcmpgts=246</b>       <b>-mcustom-fcmples=249</b>       <b>-mcustom-fcmpeqs=250</b>       <b>-mcustom-fcmpnes=251</b>
           <b>-mcustom-fmuls=252</b>         <b>-mcustom-fadds=253</b>          <b>-mcustom-fsubs=254</b>          <b>-mcustom-fdivs=255</b>
           <b>-fsingle-precision-constant</b>

           <b>-mcustom-fpu-cfg=fph2</b>  is  equivalent  to: <b>-mcustom-fabss=224</b> <b>-mcustom-fnegs=225</b> <b>-mcustom-fcmpnes=226</b>
           <b>-mcustom-fcmpeqs=227</b>       <b>-mcustom-fcmpges=228</b>       <b>-mcustom-fcmpgts=229</b>       <b>-mcustom-fcmples=230</b>
           <b>-mcustom-fcmplts=231</b>   <b>-mcustom-fmaxs=232</b>  <b>-mcustom-fmins=233</b>  <b>-mcustom-round=248</b>  <b>-mcustom-fixsi=249</b>
           <b>-mcustom-floatis=250</b>  <b>-mcustom-fsqrts=251</b>  <b>-mcustom-fmuls=252</b>  <b>-mcustom-fadds=253</b>  <b>-mcustom-fsubs=254</b>
           <b>-mcustom-fdivs=255</b>

           Custom  instruction  assignments  given  by individual <b>-mcustom-</b><u>insn</u><b>=</b> options override those given by
           <b>-mcustom-fpu-cfg=</b>, regardless of the order of the options on the command line.

           Note that you can gain more local control  over  selection  of  a  FPU  configuration  by  using  the
           target("custom-fpu-cfg=<u>name</u>") function attribute or pragma.

           The  name  <u>fph2</u> is an abbreviation for <u>Nios</u> <u>II</u> <u>Floating</u> <u>Point</u> <u>Hardware</u> <u>2</u> <u>Component</u>.  Please note that
           the custom instructions enabled by <b>-mcustom-fmins=233</b> and <b>-mcustom-fmaxs=234</b> are  only  generated  if
           <b>-ffinite-math-only</b>  is  specified.   The  custom  instruction  enabled  by <b>-mcustom-round=248</b> is only
           generated  if  <b>-fno-math-errno</b>  is   specified.    In   contrast   to   the   other   configurations,
           <b>-fsingle-precision-constant</b> is not set.

       These additional <b>-m</b> options are available for the Altera Nios II ELF (bare-metal) target:

       <b>-mhal</b>
           Link  with  HAL BSP.  This suppresses linking with the GCC-provided C runtime startup and termination
           code, and is typically used in conjunction with <b>-msys-crt0=</b> to specify the location of the  alternate
           startup code provided by the HAL BSP.

       <b>-msmallc</b>
           Link with a limited version of the C library, <b>-lsmallc</b>, rather than Newlib.

       <b>-msys-crt0=</b><u>startfile</u>
           <u>startfile</u>  is  the file name of the startfile (crt0) to use when linking.  This option is only useful
           in conjunction with <b>-mhal</b>.

       <b>-msys-lib=</b><u>systemlib</u>
           <u>systemlib</u> is the library name of the library that provides low-level system calls required by  the  C
           library, e.g. "read" and "write".  This option is typically used to link with a library provided by a
           HAL BSP.

       <u>Nvidia</u> <u>PTX</u> <u>Options</u>

       These options are defined for Nvidia PTX:

       <b>-m64</b>
           Ignored, but preserved for backward compatibility.  Only 64-bit ABI is supported.

       <b>-misa=</b><u>ISA-string</u>
           Generate  code  for given the specified PTX ISA (e.g. <b>sm_35</b>).  ISA strings must be lower-case.  Valid
           ISA strings include <b>sm_30</b> and <b>sm_35</b>.  The default ISA is sm_35.

       <b>-mmainkernel</b>
           Link in code for a __main kernel.  This is for stand-alone instead of offloading execution.

       <b>-moptimize</b>
           Apply partitioned execution optimizations.  This is the default when any  level  of  optimization  is
           selected.

       <b>-msoft-stack</b>
           Generate code that does not use ".local" memory directly for stack storage. Instead, a per-warp stack
           pointer is maintained explicitly. This enables variable-length stack allocation (with variable-length
           arrays  or  "alloca"),  and  when  global memory is used for underlying storage, makes it possible to
           access automatic variables from other threads, or with  atomic  instructions.  This  code  generation
           variant  is  used  for  OpenMP  offloading,  but  the option is exposed on its own for the purpose of
           testing the compiler; to generate code suitable for linking into programs  using  OpenMP  offloading,
           use option <b>-mgomp</b>.

       <b>-muniform-simt</b>
           Switch  to code generation variant that allows to execute all threads in each warp, while maintaining
           memory state and side effects as if only one thread in each warp was active outside  of  OpenMP  SIMD
           regions.   All  atomic  operations  and  calls  to  runtime (malloc, free, vprintf) are conditionally
           executed (iff current lane index equals the master lane index), and the register  being  assigned  is
           copied via a shuffle instruction from the master lane.  Outside of SIMD regions lane 0 is the master;
           inside,  each  thread sees itself as the master.  Shared memory array "int __nvptx_uni[]" stores all-
           zeros or all-ones bitmasks for each warp, indicating current mode (0 outside of SIMD regions).   Each
           thread  can bitwise-and the bitmask at position "tid.y" with current lane index to compute the master
           lane index.

       <b>-mgomp</b>
           Generate code for use in OpenMP offloading: enables  <b>-msoft-stack</b>  and  <b>-muniform-simt</b>  options,  and
           selects corresponding multilib variant.

       <u>OpenRISC</u> <u>Options</u>

       These options are defined for OpenRISC:

       <b>-mboard=</b><u>name</u>
           Configure  a  board  specific  runtime.   This  will be passed to the linker for newlib board library
           linking.  The default is "or1ksim".

       <b>-mnewlib</b>
           This option is ignored; it is for compatibility purposes  only.   This  used  to  select  linker  and
           preprocessor options for use with newlib.

       <b>-msoft-div</b>
       <b>-mhard-div</b>
           Select  software  or  hardware  divide  ("l.div",  "l.divu")  instructions.  This default is hardware
           divide.

       <b>-msoft-mul</b>
       <b>-mhard-mul</b>
           Select software or hardware multiply ("l.mul", "l.muli")  instructions.   This  default  is  hardware
           multiply.

       <b>-msoft-float</b>
       <b>-mhard-float</b>
           Select software or hardware for floating point operations.  The default is software.

       <b>-mdouble-float</b>
           When  <b>-mhard-float</b>  is  selected, enables generation of double-precision floating point instructions.
           By default functions from <u>libgcc</u> are used to perform double-precision floating point operations.

       <b>-munordered-float</b>
           When <b>-mhard-float</b> is selected, enables generation of unordered floating point compare  and  set  flag
           ("lf.sfun*")  instructions.   By default functions from <u>libgcc</u> are used to perform unordered floating
           point compare and set flag operations.

       <b>-mcmov</b>
           Enable generation of conditional move ("l.cmov") instructions.  By default  the  equivalent  will  be
           generated using set and branch.

       <b>-mror</b>
           Enable  generation of rotate right ("l.ror") instructions.  By default functions from <u>libgcc</u> are used
           to perform rotate right operations.

       <b>-mrori</b>
           Enable generation of rotate right with immediate ("l.rori") instructions.  By default functions  from
           <u>libgcc</u> are used to perform rotate right with immediate operations.

       <b>-msext</b>
           Enable  generation  of  sign  extension ("l.ext*") instructions.  By default memory loads are used to
           perform sign extension.

       <b>-msfimm</b>
           Enable generation of compare and set flag with immediate ("l.sf*i") instructions.  By  default  extra
           instructions will be generated to store the immediate to a register first.

       <b>-mshftimm</b>
           Enable  generation  of  shift with immediate ("l.srai", "l.srli", "l.slli") instructions.  By default
           extra instructions will be generated to store the immediate to a register first.

       <u>PDP-11</u> <u>Options</u>

       These options are defined for the PDP-11:

       <b>-mfpu</b>
           Use hardware FPP floating point.  This is the default.  (FIS floating point on the PDP-11/40  is  not
           supported.)  Implies -m45.

       <b>-msoft-float</b>
           Do not use hardware floating point.

       <b>-mac0</b>
           Return floating-point results in ac0 (fr0 in Unix assembler syntax).

       <b>-mno-ac0</b>
           Return floating-point results in memory.  This is the default.

       <b>-m40</b>
           Generate code for a PDP-11/40.  Implies -msoft-float -mno-split.

       <b>-m45</b>
           Generate code for a PDP-11/45.  This is the default.

       <b>-m10</b>
           Generate code for a PDP-11/10.  Implies -msoft-float -mno-split.

       <b>-mint16</b>
       <b>-mno-int32</b>
           Use 16-bit "int".  This is the default.

       <b>-mint32</b>
       <b>-mno-int16</b>
           Use 32-bit "int".

       <b>-msplit</b>
           Target has split instruction and data space.  Implies -m45.

       <b>-munix-asm</b>
           Use Unix assembler syntax.

       <b>-mdec-asm</b>
           Use DEC assembler syntax.

       <b>-mgnu-asm</b>
           Use GNU assembler syntax.  This is the default.

       <b>-mlra</b>
           Use the new LRA register allocator.  By default, the old "reload" allocator is used.

       <u>picoChip</u> <u>Options</u>

       These <b>-m</b> options are defined for picoChip implementations:

       <b>-mae=</b><u>ae_type</u>
           Set  the  instruction set, register set, and instruction scheduling parameters for array element type
           <u>ae_type</u>.  Supported values for <u>ae_type</u> are <b>ANY</b>, <b>MUL</b>, and <b>MAC</b>.

           <b>-mae=ANY</b> selects a completely generic AE type.  Code generated with this option runs on  any  of  the
           other  AE types.  The code is not as efficient as it would be if compiled for a specific AE type, and
           some types of operation (e.g., multiplication) do not work properly on all types of AE.

           <b>-mae=MUL</b> selects a MUL AE type.  This is the most useful AE  type  for  compiled  code,  and  is  the
           default.

           <b>-mae=MAC</b> selects a DSP-style MAC AE.  Code compiled with this option may suffer from poor performance
           of byte (char) manipulation, since the DSP AE does not provide hardware support for byte load/stores.

       <b>-msymbol-as-address</b>
           Enable  the compiler to directly use a symbol name as an address in a load/store instruction, without
           first loading it into a register.  Typically, the use of this option generates larger programs, which
           run faster than when the option isn't used.  However, the results vary from program to program, so it
           is left as a user option, rather than being permanently enabled.

       <b>-mno-inefficient-warnings</b>
           Disables warnings about the generation of inefficient code.  These warnings  can  be  generated,  for
           example,  when compiling code that performs byte-level memory operations on the MAC AE type.  The MAC
           AE has no hardware support for  byte-level  memory  operations,  so  all  byte  load/stores  must  be
           synthesized  from  word  load/store  operations.   This  is inefficient and a warning is generated to
           indicate that you should rewrite the code to avoid byte operations, or to target an AE type that  has
           the necessary hardware support.  This option disables these warnings.

       <u>PowerPC</u> <u>Options</u>

       These are listed under

       <u>PRU</u> <u>Options</u>

       These command-line options are defined for PRU target:

       <b>-minrt</b>
           Link  with  a  minimum runtime environment, with no support for static initializers and constructors.
           Using this option can significantly reduce the size  of  the  final  ELF  binary.   Beware  that  the
           compiler  could  still  generate  code  with  static  initializers and constructors.  It is up to the
           programmer to ensure that the source program will not use those features.

       <b>-mmcu=</b><u>mcu</u>
           Specify the PRU MCU variant to use.  Check Newlib for the exact list of supported MCUs.

       <b>-mno-relax</b>
           Make GCC pass the <b>--no-relax</b> command-line option to the linker instead of the <b>--relax</b> option.

       <b>-mloop</b>
           Allow (or do not allow) GCC to use the LOOP instruction.

       <b>-mabi=</b><u>variant</u>
           Specify the ABI variant to output code for.  <b>-mabi=ti</b> selects the unmodified TI ABI  while  <b>-mabi=gnu</b>
           selects  a  GNU  variant  that  copes  more  naturally  with  certain GCC assumptions.  These are the
           differences:

           <b>Function</b> <b>Pointer</b> <b>Size</b>
               TI ABI specifies that function (code) pointers are 16-bit, whereas GNU supports only 32-bit  data
               and code pointers.

           <b>Optional</b> <b>Return</b> <b>Value</b> <b>Pointer</b>
               Function  return  values  larger  than  64 bits are passed by using a hidden pointer as the first
               argument of the function.  TI ABI, though, mandates that the pointer can  be  NULL  in  case  the
               caller  is  not  using  the  returned  value.  GNU always passes and expects a valid return value
               pointer.

           The current <b>-mabi=ti</b> implementation simply raises  a  compile  error  when  any  of  the  above  code
           constructs  is  detected.   As a consequence the standard C library cannot be built and it is omitted
           when linking with <b>-mabi=ti</b>.

           Relaxation is a GNU feature and for safety reasons is disabled when using <b>-mabi=ti</b>.  The TI toolchain
           does not emit relocations for QBBx instructions, so the GNU linker cannot adjust them when shortening
           adjacent LDI32 pseudo instructions.

       <u>RISC-V</u> <u>Options</u>

       These command-line options are defined for RISC-V targets:

       <b>-mbranch-cost=</b><u>n</u>
           Set the cost of branches to roughly <u>n</u> instructions.

       <b>-mplt</b>
       <b>-mno-plt</b>
           When generating PIC code, do or don't allow the use of PLTs. Ignored for  non-PIC.   The  default  is
           <b>-mplt</b>.

       <b>-mabi=</b><u>ABI-string</u>
           Specify  integer  and  floating-point calling convention.  <u>ABI-string</u> contains two parts: the size of
           integer  types  and  the  registers  used  for  floating-point  types.   For  example  <b>-march=rv64ifd</b>
           <b>-mabi=lp64d</b>  means that <b>long</b> and pointers are 64-bit (implicitly defining <b>int</b> to be 32-bit), and that
           floating-point  values  up  to  64  bits  wide  are  passed  in  F  registers.   Contrast  this  with
           <b>-march=rv64ifd</b>  <b>-mabi=lp64f</b>,  which  still allows the compiler to generate code that uses the F and D
           extensions but only allows floating-point values up to 32 bits long to be  passed  in  registers;  or
           <b>-march=rv64ifd</b> <b>-mabi=lp64</b>, in which no floating-point arguments will be passed in registers.

           The  default  for  this  argument  is  system dependent, users who want a specific calling convention
           should specify one explicitly.  The valid calling  conventions  are:  <b>ilp32</b>,  <b>ilp32f</b>,  <b>ilp32d</b>,  <b>lp64</b>,
           <b>lp64f</b>,  and  <b>lp64d</b>.   Some calling conventions are impossible to implement on some ISAs: for example,
           <b>-march=rv32if</b> <b>-mabi=ilp32d</b> is invalid  because  the  ABI  requires  64-bit  values  be  passed  in  F
           registers, but F registers are only 32 bits wide.  There is also the <b>ilp32e</b> ABI that can only be used
           with the <b>rv32e</b> architecture.  This ABI is not well specified at present, and is subject to change.

       <b>-mfdiv</b>
       <b>-mno-fdiv</b>
           Do  or don't use hardware floating-point divide and square root instructions.  This requires the F or
           D extensions for floating-point registers.  The default is to use them if the specified  architecture
           has these instructions.

       <b>-mdiv</b>
       <b>-mno-div</b>
           Do  or  don't  use  hardware  instructions for integer division.  This requires the M extension.  The
           default is to use them if the specified architecture has these instructions.

       <b>-march=</b><u>ISA-string</u>
           Generate code for given RISC-V ISA (e.g. <b>rv64im</b>).  ISA strings must be lower-case.  Examples  include
           <b>rv64i</b>, <b>rv32g</b>, <b>rv32e</b>, and <b>rv32imaf</b>.

           When <b>-march=</b> is not specified, use the setting from <b>-mcpu</b>.

           If both <b>-march</b> and <b>-mcpu=</b> are not specified, the default for this argument is system dependent, users
           who want a specific architecture extensions should specify one explicitly.

       <b>-mcpu=</b><u>processor-string</u>
           Use  architecture  of  and  optimize  the output for the given processor, specified by particular CPU
           name.  Permissible values for  this  option  are:  <b>sifive-e20</b>,  <b>sifive-e21</b>,  <b>sifive-e24</b>,  <b>sifive-e31</b>,
           <b>sifive-e34</b>, <b>sifive-e76</b>, <b>sifive-s21</b>, <b>sifive-s51</b>, <b>sifive-s54</b>, <b>sifive-s76</b>, <b>sifive-u54</b>, and <b>sifive-u74</b>.

       <b>-mtune=</b><u>processor-string</u>
           Optimize  the  output for the given processor, specified by microarchitecture or particular CPU name.
           Permissible values for this option are: <b>rocket</b>,  <b>sifive-3-series</b>,  <b>sifive-5-series</b>,  <b>sifive-7-series</b>,
           <b>size</b>, and all valid options for <b>-mcpu=</b>.

           When  <b>-mtune=</b>  is  not  specified,  use the setting from <b>-mcpu</b>, the default is <b>rocket</b> if both are not
           specified.

           The <b>size</b> choice is not intended for use by end-users.  This  is  used  when  <b>-Os</b>  is  specified.   It
           overrides  the  instruction  cost  info provided by <b>-mtune=</b>, but does not override the pipeline info.
           This helps reduce code size while still giving good performance.

       <b>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=</b><u>num</u>
           Attempt  to  keep  the  stack  boundary  aligned  to  a  2  raised  to   <u>num</u>   byte   boundary.    If
           <b>-mpreferred-stack-boundary</b> is not specified, the default is 4 (16 bytes or 128-bits).

           <b>Warning:</b>  If  you use this switch, then you must build all modules with the same value, including any
           libraries.  This includes the system libraries and startup modules.

       <b>-msmall-data-limit=</b><u>n</u>
           Put global and static data smaller than <u>n</u> bytes into a special section (on some targets).

       <b>-msave-restore</b>
       <b>-mno-save-restore</b>
           Do or don't use smaller but slower prologue and epilogue code that uses library function calls.   The
           default is to use fast inline prologues and epilogues.

       <b>-mshorten-memrefs</b>
       <b>-mno-shorten-memrefs</b>
           Do or do not attempt to make more use of compressed load/store instructions by replacing a load/store
           of  'base  register  +  large offset' with a new load/store of 'new base + small offset'.  If the new
           base gets stored in a compressed register, then the new  load/store  can  be  compressed.   Currently
           targets 32-bit integer load/stores only.

       <b>-mstrict-align</b>
       <b>-mno-strict-align</b>
           Do  not  or  do  generate  unaligned  memory  accesses.   The default is set depending on whether the
           processor we are optimizing for supports fast unaligned access or not.

       <b>-mcmodel=medlow</b>
           Generate code for the medium-low code model. The program and its statically defined symbols must  lie
           within  a  single  2  GiB  address  range  and must lie between absolute addresses -2 GiB and +2 GiB.
           Programs can be statically or dynamically linked. This is the default code model.

       <b>-mcmodel=medany</b>
           Generate code for the medium-any code model. The program and its statically defined symbols  must  be
           within any single 2 GiB address range. Programs can be statically or dynamically linked.

       <b>-mexplicit-relocs</b>
       <b>-mno-exlicit-relocs</b>
           Use  or  do  not  use  assembler  relocation  operators  when  dealing  with symbolic addresses.  The
           alternative is to use assembler macros instead, which may limit optimization.

       <b>-mrelax</b>
       <b>-mno-relax</b>
           Take advantage of linker relaxations to reduce the number of  instructions  required  to  materialize
           symbol addresses. The default is to take advantage of linker relaxations.

       <b>-memit-attribute</b>
       <b>-mno-emit-attribute</b>
           Emit  (do  not  emit)  RISC-V  attribute  to record extra information into ELF objects.  This feature
           requires at least binutils 2.32.

       <b>-malign-data=</b><u>type</u>
           Control how GCC aligns variables and constants of array, structure, or union types.  Supported values
           for <u>type</u> are <b>xlen</b> which uses x register width as the alignment value, and <b>natural</b> which uses  natural
           alignment.  <b>xlen</b> is the default.

       <b>-mbig-endian</b>
           Generate  big-endian  code.   This  is  the  default  when  GCC  is configured for a <b>riscv64be-*-*</b> or
           <b>riscv32be-*-*</b> target.

       <b>-mlittle-endian</b>
           Generate little-endian code.  This is the default  when  GCC  is  configured  for  a  <b>riscv64-*-*</b>  or
           <b>riscv32-*-*</b> but not a <b>riscv64be-*-*</b> or <b>riscv32be-*-*</b> target.

       <b>-mstack-protector-guard=</b><u>guard</u>
       <b>-mstack-protector-guard-reg=</b><u>reg</u>
       <b>-mstack-protector-guard-offset=</b><u>offset</u>
           Generate  stack  protection  code using canary at <u>guard</u>.  Supported locations are <b>global</b> for a global
           canary or <b>tls</b> for per-thread canary in the TLS block.

           With     the     latter     choice     the      options      <b>-mstack-protector-guard-reg=</b><u>reg</u>      and
           <b>-mstack-protector-guard-offset=</b><u>offset</u>  furthermore specify which register to use as base register for
           reading the canary, and from what offset from that base register. There is  no  default  register  or
           offset as this is entirely for use within the Linux kernel.

       <u>RL78</u> <u>Options</u>

       <b>-msim</b>
           Links in additional target libraries to support operation within a simulator.

       <b>-mmul=none</b>
       <b>-mmul=g10</b>
       <b>-mmul=g13</b>
       <b>-mmul=g14</b>
       <b>-mmul=rl78</b>
           Specifies  the  type  of  hardware  multiplication  and division support to be used.  The simplest is
           "none", which uses software for both multiplication and division.  This is the  default.   The  "g13"
           value  is  for  the hardware multiply/divide peripheral found on the RL78/G13 (S2 core) targets.  The
           "g14" value selects the use of the multiplication and division instructions supported by the RL78/G14
           (S3 core) parts.  The value "rl78" is an alias for "g14" and the value "mg10" is an alias for "none".

           In addition a C preprocessor macro is defined, based upon  the  setting  of  this  option.   Possible
           values are: "__RL78_MUL_NONE__", "__RL78_MUL_G13__" or "__RL78_MUL_G14__".

       <b>-mcpu=g10</b>
       <b>-mcpu=g13</b>
       <b>-mcpu=g14</b>
       <b>-mcpu=rl78</b>
           Specifies  the  RL78  core  to target.  The default is the G14 core, also known as an S3 core or just
           RL78.  The G13 or S2 core does not have multiply or divide instructions, instead it uses  a  hardware
           peripheral  for  these  operations.   The  G10  or S1 core does not have register banks, so it uses a
           different calling convention.

           If this option is set it also selects the type of hardware multiply support to use,  unless  this  is
           overridden  by  an explicit <b>-mmul=none</b> option on the command line.  Thus specifying <b>-mcpu=g13</b> enables
           the use of the G13 hardware multiply peripheral and specifying <b>-mcpu=g10</b> disables the use of hardware
           multiplications altogether.

           Note, although the RL78/G14 core is the default target, specifying <b>-mcpu=g14</b>  or  <b>-mcpu=rl78</b>  on  the
           command  line  does  change the behavior of the toolchain since it also enables G14 hardware multiply
           support.  If these options are not  specified  on  the  command  line  then  software  multiplication
           routines  will  be  used  even  though  the  code  targets  the  RL78  core.   This  is for backwards
           compatibility with older toolchains which did not have hardware multiply and divide support.

           In addition a C preprocessor macro is defined, based upon  the  setting  of  this  option.   Possible
           values are: "__RL78_G10__", "__RL78_G13__" or "__RL78_G14__".

       <b>-mg10</b>
       <b>-mg13</b>
       <b>-mg14</b>
       <b>-mrl78</b>
           These   are   aliases  for  the  corresponding  <b>-mcpu=</b>  option.   They  are  provided  for  backwards
           compatibility.

       <b>-mallregs</b>
           Allow the compiler to use all of the  available  registers.   By  default  registers  "r24..r31"  are
           reserved  for  use  in  interrupt  handlers.  With this option enabled these registers can be used in
           ordinary functions as well.

       <b>-m64bit-doubles</b>
       <b>-m32bit-doubles</b>
           Make the "double" data type be 64 bits (<b>-m64bit-doubles</b>) or 32 bits (<b>-m32bit-doubles</b>) in  size.   The
           default is <b>-m32bit-doubles</b>.

       <b>-msave-mduc-in-interrupts</b>
       <b>-mno-save-mduc-in-interrupts</b>
           Specifies  that  interrupt  handler  functions  should  preserve  the  MDUC  registers.  This is only
           necessary if normal code might use the MDUC registers, for example because it performs multiplication
           and division operations.  The default is to ignore the MDUC registers as  this  makes  the  interrupt
           handlers faster.  The target option -mg13 needs to be passed for this to work as this feature is only
           available  on  the  G13  target  (S2  core).   The MDUC registers will only be saved if the interrupt
           handler performs a multiplication or division operation or it calls another function.

       <u>IBM</u> <u>RS/6000</u> <u>and</u> <u>PowerPC</u> <u>Options</u>

       These <b>-m</b> options are defined for the IBM RS/6000 and PowerPC:

       <b>-mpowerpc-gpopt</b>
       <b>-mno-powerpc-gpopt</b>
       <b>-mpowerpc-gfxopt</b>
       <b>-mno-powerpc-gfxopt</b>
       <b>-mpowerpc64</b>
       <b>-mno-powerpc64</b>
       <b>-mmfcrf</b>
       <b>-mno-mfcrf</b>
       <b>-mpopcntb</b>
       <b>-mno-popcntb</b>
       <b>-mpopcntd</b>
       <b>-mno-popcntd</b>
       <b>-mfprnd</b>
       <b>-mno-fprnd</b>
       <b>-mcmpb</b>
       <b>-mno-cmpb</b>
       <b>-mhard-dfp</b>
       <b>-mno-hard-dfp</b>
           You use these options to specify which instructions are available on the  processor  you  are  using.
           The default value of these options is determined when configuring GCC.  Specifying the <b>-mcpu=</b><u>cpu_type</u>
           overrides  the specification of these options.  We recommend you use the <b>-mcpu=</b><u>cpu_type</u> option rather
           than the options listed above.

           Specifying <b>-mpowerpc-gpopt</b> allows GCC to use the optional PowerPC architecture  instructions  in  the
           General  Purpose group, including floating-point square root.  Specifying <b>-mpowerpc-gfxopt</b> allows GCC
           to use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the Graphics group, including floating-point
           select.

           The <b>-mmfcrf</b> option allows GCC  to  generate  the  move  from  condition  register  field  instruction
           implemented on the POWER4 processor and other processors that support the PowerPC V2.01 architecture.
           The  <b>-mpopcntb</b> option allows GCC to generate the popcount and double-precision FP reciprocal estimate
           instruction implemented on the POWER5 processor and other processors that support the  PowerPC  V2.02
           architecture.   The  <b>-mpopcntd</b>  option allows GCC to generate the popcount instruction implemented on
           the POWER7 processor and other processors that support the PowerPC V2.06 architecture.   The  <b>-mfprnd</b>
           option  allows  GCC  to  generate  the  FP  round  to integer instructions implemented on the POWER5+
           processor and other processors that support the PowerPC V2.03 architecture.  The <b>-mcmpb</b> option allows
           GCC to generate the  compare  bytes  instruction  implemented  on  the  POWER6  processor  and  other
           processors that support the PowerPC V2.05 architecture.  The <b>-mhard-dfp</b> option allows GCC to generate
           the decimal floating-point instructions implemented on some POWER processors.

           The  <b>-mpowerpc64</b>  option  allows GCC to generate the additional 64-bit instructions that are found in
           the full PowerPC64 architecture and to treat GPRs as 64-bit, doubleword quantities.  GCC defaults  to
           <b>-mno-powerpc64</b>.

       <b>-mcpu=</b><u>cpu_type</u>
           Set  architecture  type,  register  usage,  and  instruction  scheduling  parameters for machine type
           <u>cpu_type</u>.  Supported values for <u>cpu_type</u> are <b>401</b>, <b>403</b>, <b>405</b>,  <b>405fp</b>,  <b>440</b>,  <b>440fp</b>,  <b>464</b>,  <b>464fp</b>,  <b>476</b>,
           <b>476fp</b>,  <b>505</b>, <b>601</b>, <b>602</b>, <b>603</b>, <b>603e</b>, <b>604</b>, <b>604e</b>, <b>620</b>, <b>630</b>, <b>740</b>, <b>7400</b>, <b>7450</b>, <b>750</b>, <b>801</b>, <b>821</b>, <b>823</b>, <b>860</b>, <b>970</b>,
           <b>8540</b>, <b>a2</b>, <b>e300c2</b>, <b>e300c3</b>, <b>e500mc</b>, <b>e500mc64</b>, <b>e5500</b>, <b>e6500</b>, <b>ec603e</b>, <b>G3</b>, <b>G4</b>, <b>G5</b>, <b>titan</b>, <b>power3</b>,  <b>power4</b>,
           <b>power5</b>,  <b>power5+</b>,  <b>power6</b>, <b>power6x</b>, <b>power7</b>, <b>power8</b>, <b>power9</b>, <b>power10</b>, <b>powerpc</b>, <b>powerpc64</b>, <b>powerpc64le</b>,
           <b>rs64</b>, and <b>native</b>.

           <b>-mcpu=powerpc</b>, <b>-mcpu=powerpc64</b>, and <b>-mcpu=powerpc64le</b> specify pure 32-bit  PowerPC  (either  endian),
           64-bit  big  endian  PowerPC  and  64-bit  little  endian PowerPC architecture machine types, with an
           appropriate, generic processor model assumed for scheduling purposes.

           Specifying <b>native</b> as cpu type detects and selects the architecture option  that  corresponds  to  the
           host  processor of the system performing the compilation.  <b>-mcpu=native</b> has no effect if GCC does not
           recognize the processor.

           The other options specify a specific processor.  Code generated under those options runs best on that
           processor, and may not run at all on others.

           The <b>-mcpu</b> options automatically enable or disable the following options:

           The particular options set for any particular CPU varies between compiler versions, depending on what
           setting  seems  to  produce  optimal  code  for  that  CPU; it doesn't necessarily reflect the actual
           hardware's capabilities.  If you wish to set an individual option to  a  particular  value,  you  may
           specify it after the <b>-mcpu</b> option, like <b>-mcpu=970</b> <b>-mno-altivec</b>.

           On  AIX,  the  <b>-maltivec</b>  and  <b>-mpowerpc64</b> options are not enabled or disabled by the <b>-mcpu</b> option at
           present because AIX does not have full support for these options.  You may still  enable  or  disable
           them individually if you're sure it'll work in your environment.

       <b>-mtune=</b><u>cpu_type</u>
           Set  the instruction scheduling parameters for machine type <u>cpu_type</u>, but do not set the architecture

       <b>-mcmodel=small</b>
           Generate PowerPC64 code for the small model: The TOC is limited to 64k.

       <b>-mcmodel=medium</b>
           Generate PowerPC64 code for the medium model: The TOC and other static data may be up to a  total  of

       <b>-maltivec</b>
       <b>-mno-altivec</b>
           Generate  code  that  uses  (does  not use) AltiVec instructions, and also enable the use of built-in

           When  <b>-maltivec</b> is used, the element order for AltiVec intrinsics such as "vec_splat", "vec_extract",
           and "vec_insert" match array element order corresponding to the endianness of the target.   That  is,
           element  zero  identifies  the  leftmost  element  in  a  vector register when targeting a big-endian
           platform, and identifies the rightmost element in a vector register when  targeting  a  little-endian

       <b>-mfloat128</b>
       <b>-mno-float128</b>
           Enable/disable  the  <b>__</b><u>float128</u>  keyword  for  IEEE  128-bit  floating  point and use either software
           emulation for IEEE 128-bit floating point or hardware instructions.

           The VSX instruction set (<b>-mvsx</b>) must be enabled to use the IEEE 128-bit floating point support.   The
           IEEE 128-bit floating point is only supported on Linux.

           The  default  for  <b>-mfloat128</b>  is enabled on PowerPC Linux systems using the VSX instruction set, and
           disabled on other systems.

           If you use the ISA 3.0 instruction set (<b>-mpower9-vector</b> or <b>-mcpu=power9</b>) on a 64-bit system, the IEEE
           128-bit floating point support will also enable the generation of ISA 3.0 IEEE 128-bit floating point
           instructions.  Otherwise, if you do not specify to generate ISA 3.0 instructions or you are targeting
           a 32-bit big endian system, IEEE 128-bit floating point will be done with software emulation.

       <b>-mfloat128-hardware</b>
       <b>-mno-float128-hardware</b>
           Enable/disable using ISA 3.0 hardware instructions to support the <b>__</b><u>float128</u> data type.

           The default for <b>-mfloat128-hardware</b> is enabled on PowerPC Linux systems using the ISA 3.0 instruction
           set, and disabled on other systems.

       <b>-m32</b>
       <b>-m64</b>
           Generate code for 32-bit or 64-bit environments of Darwin and  SVR4  targets  (including  GNU/Linux).
           The  32-bit  environment  sets  int,  long and pointer to 32 bits and generates code that runs on any
           PowerPC variant.  The 64-bit environment sets int to 32 bits and long and pointer  to  64  bits,  and
           generates code for PowerPC64, as for <b>-mpowerpc64</b>.

       <b>-mfull-toc</b>
       <b>-mno-fp-in-toc</b>
       <b>-mno-sum-in-toc</b>
       <b>-mminimal-toc</b>
           Modify  generation  of  the TOC (Table Of Contents), which is created for every executable file.  The
           <b>-mfull-toc</b> option is selected by default.  In that case, GCC allocates at least  one  TOC  entry  for
           each  unique  non-automatic  variable  reference  in  your  program.   GCC also places floating-point
           constants in the TOC.  However, only 16,384 entries are available in the TOC.

           If you receive a linker error message that saying you have overflowed the available  TOC  space,  you
           can  reduce  the  amount  of  TOC  space  used  with  the <b>-mno-fp-in-toc</b> and <b>-mno-sum-in-toc</b> options.
           <b>-mno-fp-in-toc</b> prevents GCC from putting floating-point constants  in  the  TOC  and  <b>-mno-sum-in-toc</b>
           forces  GCC to generate code to calculate the sum of an address and a constant at run time instead of
           putting that sum into the TOC.  You may specify one or both of these options.   Each  causes  GCC  to
           produce very slightly slower and larger code at the expense of conserving TOC space.

           If  you  still  run  out  of  space  in  the TOC even when you specify both of these options, specify
           <b>-mminimal-toc</b> instead.  This option causes GCC to make only one TOC entry for every file.   When  you
           specify  this option, GCC produces code that is slower and larger but which uses extremely little TOC
           space.  You may wish to use this option only on files that contain less frequently-executed code.

       <b>-maix64</b>
       <b>-maix32</b>
           Enable 64-bit AIX  ABI  and  calling  convention:  64-bit  pointers,  64-bit  "long"  type,  and  the
           infrastructure  needed  to  support  them.   Specifying  <b>-maix64</b>  implies  <b>-mpowerpc64</b>, while <b>-maix32</b>
           disables the 64-bit ABI and implies <b>-mno-powerpc64</b>.  GCC defaults to <b>-maix32</b>.

       <b>-mxl-compat</b>
       <b>-mno-xl-compat</b>
           Produce code that conforms more closely to IBM XL compiler semantics when using  AIX-compatible  ABI.
           Pass  floating-point  arguments  to  prototyped  functions beyond the register save area (RSA) on the
           stack in addition to argument FPRs.  Do not assume that  most  significant  double  in  128-bit  long
           double value is properly rounded when comparing values and converting to double.  Use XL symbol names
           for long double support routines.

           The  AIX calling convention was extended but not initially documented to handle an obscure K&amp;R C case
           of calling a function that takes the address of its arguments with  fewer  arguments  than  declared.
           IBM  XL  compilers  access  floating-point arguments that do not fit in the RSA from the stack when a
           subroutine is compiled without optimization.  Because always storing floating-point arguments on  the
           stack  is  inefficient and rarely needed, this option is not enabled by default and only is necessary
           when calling subroutines compiled by IBM XL compilers without optimization.

       <b>-mpe</b>
           Support <u>IBM</u> <u>RS/6000</u> <u>SP</u> <u>Parallel</u> <u>Environment</u> (PE).  Link an application written to use message passing
           with special startup code to enable the application to run.  The system must have PE installed in the
           standard location (<u>/usr/lpp/ppe.poe/</u>), or the <u>specs</u> file must be overridden with the  <b>-specs=</b>  option
           to specify the appropriate directory location.  The Parallel Environment does not support threads, so
           the <b>-mpe</b> option and the <b>-pthread</b> option are incompatible.

       <b>-malign-natural</b>
       <b>-malign-power</b>
           On  AIX,  32-bit  Darwin, and 64-bit PowerPC GNU/Linux, the option <b>-malign-natural</b> overrides the ABI-
           defined alignment of larger types, such  as  floating-point  doubles,  on  their  natural  size-based
           boundary.   The  option <b>-malign-power</b> instructs GCC to follow the ABI-specified alignment rules.  GCC
           defaults to the standard alignment defined in the ABI.

           On 64-bit Darwin, natural alignment is the default, and <b>-malign-power</b> is not supported.

       <b>-msoft-float</b>
       <b>-mhard-float</b>
           Generate code that does not use (uses) the  floating-point  register  set.   Software  floating-point
           emulation is provided if you use the <b>-msoft-float</b> option, and pass the option to GCC when linking.

       <b>-mmultiple</b>
       <b>-mno-multiple</b>
           Generate  code  that  uses  (does not use) the load multiple word instructions and the store multiple
           word instructions.  These instructions are generated by default on POWER systems, and  not  generated
           on PowerPC systems.  Do not use <b>-mmultiple</b> on little-endian PowerPC systems, since those instructions
           do  not work when the processor is in little-endian mode.  The exceptions are PPC740 and PPC750 which
           permit these instructions in little-endian mode.

       <b>-mupdate</b>
       <b>-mno-update</b>
           Generate code that uses (does not use) the load or store instructions that update the  base  register
           to  the  address of the calculated memory location.  These instructions are generated by default.  If
           you use <b>-mno-update</b>, there is a small window between the time that the stack pointer is  updated  and
           the  address  of  the  previous  frame  is stored, which means code that walks the stack frame across
           interrupts or signals may get corrupted data.

       <b>-mavoid-indexed-addresses</b>
       <b>-mno-avoid-indexed-addresses</b>
           Generate code that tries to avoid (not avoid) the use of indexed load or  store  instructions.  These
           instructions can incur a performance penalty on Power6 processors in certain situations, such as when
           stepping  through  large  arrays  that  cross a 16M boundary.  This option is enabled by default when
           targeting Power6 and disabled otherwise.

       <b>-mfused-madd</b>
       <b>-mno-fused-madd</b>
           Generate code that uses (does not use)  the  floating-point  multiply  and  accumulate  instructions.
           These  instructions  are  generated  by  default  if  hardware  floating point is used.  The machine-
           dependent <b>-mfused-madd</b> option is now mapped to the machine-independent <b>-ffp-contract=fast</b> option, and
           <b>-mno-fused-madd</b> is mapped to <b>-ffp-contract=off</b>.

       <b>-mmulhw</b>
       <b>-mno-mulhw</b>
           Generate code that uses (does not use) the half-word multiply and multiply-accumulate instructions on
           the IBM 405, 440, 464 and 476 processors.  These instructions are generated by default when targeting
           those processors.

       <b>-mdlmzb</b>
       <b>-mno-dlmzb</b>
           Generate code that uses (does not use) the string-search <b>dlmzb</b> instruction on the IBM 405,  440,  464
           and 476 processors.  This instruction is generated by default when targeting those processors.

       <b>-mno-bit-align</b>
       <b>-mbit-align</b>
           On  System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do not (do) force structures and unions that contain bit-
           fields to be aligned to the base type of the bit-field.

           For example, by default a structure containing nothing but 8 "unsigned" bit-fields  of  length  1  is
           aligned  to  a  4-byte boundary and has a size of 4 bytes.  By using <b>-mno-bit-align</b>, the structure is
           aligned to a 1-byte boundary and is 1 byte in size.

       <b>-mno-strict-align</b>
       <b>-mstrict-align</b>
           On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do not (do) assume that unaligned  memory  references  are
           handled by the system.

       <b>-mrelocatable</b>
       <b>-mno-relocatable</b>
           Generate code that allows (does not allow) a static executable to be relocated to a different address
           at  run time.  A simple embedded PowerPC system loader should relocate the entire contents of ".got2"
           and 4-byte locations listed in the ".fixup" section, a table of 32-bit addresses  generated  by  this
           option.   For  this  to  work,  all  objects  linked  together must be compiled with <b>-mrelocatable</b> or
           <b>-mrelocatable-lib</b>.  <b>-mrelocatable</b> code aligns the stack to an 8-byte boundary.

       <b>-mrelocatable-lib</b>
       <b>-mno-relocatable-lib</b>
           Like <b>-mrelocatable</b>, <b>-mrelocatable-lib</b> generates a ".fixup" section to allow static executables to  be
           relocated  at  run  time,  but  <b>-mrelocatable-lib</b>  does  not  use  the  smaller  stack  alignment  of
           <b>-mrelocatable</b>.  Objects compiled with <b>-mrelocatable-lib</b> may be linked with objects compiled with  any
           combination of the <b>-mrelocatable</b> options.

       <b>-mno-toc</b>
       <b>-mtoc</b>
           On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do not (do) assume that register 2 contains a pointer to a
           global area pointing to the addresses used in the program.

       <b>-mlittle</b>
       <b>-mlittle-endian</b>
           On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for the processor in little-endian mode.  The
           <b>-mlittle-endian</b> option is the same as <b>-mlittle</b>.

       <b>-mbig</b>
       <b>-mbig-endian</b>
           On  System  V.4  and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for the processor in big-endian mode.  The
           <b>-mbig-endian</b> option is the same as <b>-mbig</b>.

       <b>-mdynamic-no-pic</b>
           On Darwin and Mac OS X systems, compile code so that it is not relocatable,  but  that  its  external
           references  are  relocatable.   The  resulting  code  is  suitable  for  applications, but not shared
           libraries.

       <b>-msingle-pic-base</b>
           Treat the register used for PIC addressing as read-only, rather than loading it in the  prologue  for
           each  function.  The runtime system is responsible for initializing this register with an appropriate
           value before execution begins.

       <b>-mprioritize-restricted-insns=</b><u>priority</u>
           This option controls the priority that is assigned to dispatch-slot  restricted  instructions  during
           the  second scheduling pass.  The argument <u>priority</u> takes the value <b>0</b>, <b>1</b>, or <b>2</b> to assign no, highest,
           or second-highest (respectively) priority to dispatch-slot restricted instructions.

       <b>-msched-costly-dep=</b><u>dependence_type</u>
           This option controls which dependences  are  considered  costly  by  the  target  during  instruction
           scheduling.  The argument <u>dependence_type</u> takes one of the following values:

           <b>no</b>  No dependence is costly.

           <b>all</b> All dependences are costly.

           <b>true_store_to_load</b>
               A true dependence from store to load is costly.

           <b>store_to_load</b>
               Any dependence from store to load is costly.

           <u>number</u>
               Any dependence for which the latency is greater than or equal to <u>number</u> is costly.

       <b>-minsert-sched-nops=</b><u>scheme</u>
           This  option  controls  which  NOP  insertion  scheme is used during the second scheduling pass.  The
           argument <u>scheme</u> takes one of the following values:

           <b>no</b>  Don't insert NOPs.

           <b>pad</b> Pad with NOPs any dispatch group that has  vacant  issue  slots,  according  to  the  scheduler's
               grouping.

           <b>regroup_exact</b>
               Insert NOPs to force costly dependent insns into separate groups.  Insert exactly as many NOPs as
               needed to force an insn to a new group, according to the estimated processor grouping.

           <u>number</u>
               Insert NOPs to force costly dependent insns into separate groups.  Insert <u>number</u> NOPs to force an

           Select the type of traceback table. Valid values for <u>traceback_type</u> are <b>full</b>, <b>part</b>, and <b>no</b>.

       <b>-maix-struct-return</b>
           Return all structures in memory (as specified by the AIX ABI).

       <b>-msvr4-struct-return</b>
           Return structures smaller than 8 bytes in registers (as specified by the SVR4 ABI).

       <b>-mabi=</b><u>abi-type</u>
           Extend the current ABI with a particular extension, or remove  such  extension.   Valid  values  are:

           <b>default</b>.

       <b>-mabi=ibmlongdouble</b>
           Change the current ABI to use IBM extended-precision long double.  This is not likely to work if your
           system defaults to using IEEE extended-precision long double.  If you change  the  long  double  type
           from IEEE extended-precision, the compiler will issue a warning unless you use the <b>-Wno-psabi</b> option.
           Requires <b>-mlong-double-128</b> to be enabled.

       <b>-mabi=ieeelongdouble</b>
           Change  the  current  ABI  to use IEEE extended-precision long double.  This is not likely to work if
           your system defaults to using IBM extended-precision long double.  If you change the long double type

           Requires <b>-mlong-double-128</b> to be enabled.

       <b>-mabi=elfv1</b>
           Change  the  current ABI to use the ELFv1 ABI.  This is the default ABI for big-endian PowerPC 64-bit
           Linux.  Overriding the default ABI  requires  special  system  support  and  is  likely  to  fail  in
           spectacular ways.

       <b>-mabi=elfv2</b>
           Change  the  current  ABI  to  use  the ELFv2 ABI.  This is the default ABI for little-endian PowerPC
           64-bit Linux.  Overriding the default ABI requires special system support and is likely  to  fail  in
           spectacular ways.

       <b>-mgnu-attribute</b>
       <b>-mno-gnu-attribute</b>
           Emit  .gnu_attribute  assembly  directives  to  set tag/value pairs in a .gnu.attributes section that
           specify ABI variations in function parameters or return values.

       <b>-mprototype</b>
       <b>-mno-prototype</b>
           On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems assume that all calls to variable argument  functions  are
           properly  prototyped.  Otherwise, the compiler must insert an instruction before every non-prototyped
           call to set or clear bit 6 of the condition code register ("CR") to indicate  whether  floating-point
           values  are  passed  in  the  floating-point registers in case the function takes variable arguments.
           With <b>-mprototype</b>, only calls to prototyped variable argument functions set or clear the bit.

       <b>-msim</b>
           On embedded PowerPC systems, assume that the  startup  module  is  called  <u>sim-crt0.o</u>  and  that  the
           standard   C  libraries  are  <u>libsim.a</u>  and  <u>libc.a</u>.   This  is  the  default  for  <b>powerpc-*-eabisim</b>
           configurations.

       <b>-mmvme</b>
           On embedded PowerPC systems, assume that the startup module is  called  <u>crt0.o</u>  and  the  standard  C
           libraries are <u>libmvme.a</u> and <u>libc.a</u>.

       <b>-mads</b>
           On  embedded  PowerPC  systems,  assume  that  the startup module is called <u>crt0.o</u> and the standard C

       <b>-mvxworks</b>
           On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, specify that you are compiling for a VxWorks system.

       <b>-memb</b>
           On  embedded  PowerPC  systems,  set  the "PPC_EMB" bit in the ELF flags header to indicate that <b>eabi</b>
           extended relocations are used.

       <b>-meabi</b>
       <b>-mno-eabi</b>
           On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do (do not) adhere to  the  Embedded  Applications  Binary
           Interface (EABI), which is a set of modifications to the System V.4 specifications.  Selecting <b>-meabi</b>
           means  that  the stack is aligned to an 8-byte boundary, a function "__eabi" is called from "main" to
           set up the EABI environment, and the <b>-msdata</b> option can use both "r2"  and  "r13"  to  point  to  two
           separate  small  data  areas.   Selecting  <b>-mno-eabi</b>  means  that  the  stack is aligned to a 16-byte
           boundary, no EABI initialization function is called from "main", and the  <b>-msdata</b>  option  only  uses
           "r13" to point to a single small data area.  The <b>-meabi</b> option is on by default if you configured GCC
           using one of the <b>powerpc*-*-eabi*</b> options.

       <b>-msdata=eabi</b>
           On  System  V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, put small initialized "const" global and static data in
           the ".sdata2" section, which is pointed to by  register  "r2".   Put  small  initialized  non-"const"
           global  and  static  data  in the ".sdata" section, which is pointed to by register "r13".  Put small
           uninitialized global and static data in the ".sbss"  section,  which  is  adjacent  to  the  ".sdata"
           section.   The  <b>-msdata=eabi</b>  option is incompatible with the <b>-mrelocatable</b> option.  The <b>-msdata=eabi</b>
           option also sets the <b>-memb</b> option.

       <b>-msdata=sysv</b>
           On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, put small global and static data in the ".sdata" section,
           which is pointed to by register "r13".  Put small uninitialized global and static data in the ".sbss"
           section, which is adjacent to the ".sdata" section.  The <b>-msdata=sysv</b> option is incompatible with the
           <b>-mrelocatable</b> option.

       <b>-msdata=default</b>
       <b>-msdata</b>
           On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, if <b>-meabi</b> is used, compile code the same as <b>-msdata=eabi</b>,
           otherwise compile code the same as <b>-msdata=sysv</b>.

       <b>-msdata=data</b>
           On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, put small global data in the ".sdata" section.  Put small
           uninitialized global data in the ".sbss" section.  Do not use register "r13" to  address  small  data
           however.  This is the default behavior unless other <b>-msdata</b> options are used.

       <b>-msdata=none</b>
       <b>-mno-sdata</b>
           On  embedded  PowerPC systems, put all initialized global and static data in the ".data" section, and
           all uninitialized data in the ".bss" section.

       <b>-mreadonly-in-sdata</b>
           Put read-only objects in the ".sdata" section as well.  This is the default.

       <b>-mblock-move-inline-limit=</b><u>num</u>
           Inline all block moves (such as calls to "memcpy" or structure copies) less  than  or  equal  to  <u>num</u>
           bytes.   The minimum value for <u>num</u> is 32 bytes on 32-bit targets and 64 bytes on 64-bit targets.  The
           default value is target-specific.

       <b>-mblock-compare-inline-limit=</b><u>num</u>
           Generate non-looping inline code for all block compares (such  as  calls  to  "memcmp"  or  structure
           compares)  less  than or equal to <u>num</u> bytes. If <u>num</u> is 0, all inline expansion (non-loop and loop) of
           block compare is disabled. The default value is target-specific.

       <b>-mblock-compare-inline-loop-limit=</b><u>num</u>
           Generate an inline expansion using loop code for all block compares that are less than  or  equal  to
           <u>num</u>  bytes,  but  greater  than  the  limit for non-loop inline block compare expansion. If the block
           length is not constant, at most <u>num</u> bytes will be compared before "memcmp" is called to  compare  the
           remainder of the block. The default value is target-specific.

       <b>-mstring-compare-inline-limit=</b><u>num</u>
           Compare  at  most <u>num</u> string bytes with inline code.  If the difference or end of string is not found
           at the end of the inline compare a call to "strcmp" or "strncmp" will take care of the  rest  of  the
           comparison. The default is 64 bytes.

       <b>-G</b> <u>num</u>
           On  embedded  PowerPC  systems,  put global and static items less than or equal to <u>num</u> bytes into the
           small data or BSS sections instead of the normal data or BSS section.  By default, <u>num</u> is 8.  The  <b>-G</b>
           <u>num</u> switch is also passed to the linker.  All modules should be compiled with the same <b>-G</b> <u>num</u> value.

       <b>-mregnames</b>
       <b>-mno-regnames</b>
           On  System  V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do (do not) emit register names in the assembly language
           output using symbolic forms.

       <b>-mlongcall</b>
       <b>-mno-longcall</b>
           By default assume that all calls are far away so that a longer and more expensive calling sequence is
           required.  This is required for calls farther than 32 megabytes (33,554,432 bytes) from  the  current
           location.   A  short  call is generated if the compiler knows the call cannot be that far away.  This
           setting can be overridden by the "shortcall" function attribute, or by #pragma <a href="../man0/longcall.0.html">longcall</a>(0).

           Some linkers are capable of detecting out-of-range calls and generating glue code  on  the  fly.   On
           these  systems,  long  calls  are  unnecessary and generate slower code.  As of this writing, the AIX
           linker can do this, as can the GNU linker for PowerPC/64.  It is planned to add this feature  to  the
           GNU linker for 32-bit PowerPC systems as well.

           On  PowerPC64  ELFv2  and  32-bit PowerPC systems with newer GNU linkers, GCC can generate long calls
           using an inline PLT call sequence (see <b>-mpltseq</b>).  PowerPC with <b>-mbss-plt</b> and PowerPC64  ELFv1  (big-
           endian) do not support inline PLT calls.

           On  Darwin/PPC  systems,  "#pragma longcall" generates "jbsr callee, L42", plus a <u>branch</u> <u>island</u> (glue
           code).  The two target addresses represent the callee and the branch island.  The  Darwin/PPC  linker
           prefers  the first address and generates a "bl callee" if the PPC "bl" instruction reaches the callee
           directly; otherwise, the linker generates "bl L42" to call the branch island.  The branch  island  is
           appended  to  the body of the calling function; it computes the full 32-bit address of the callee and
           jumps to it.

           On Mach-O (Darwin) systems, this option directs the compiler emit to the glue for every direct  call,
           and the Darwin linker decides whether to use or discard it.

           In the future, GCC may ignore all longcall specifications when the linker is known to generate glue.

       <b>-mpltseq</b>
       <b>-mno-pltseq</b>
           Implement  (do not implement) -fno-plt and long calls using an inline PLT call sequence that supports
           lazy linking and long calls to functions in dlopen'd shared libraries.  Inline  PLT  calls  are  only
           supported  on  PowerPC64  ELFv2 and 32-bit PowerPC systems with newer GNU linkers, and are enabled by
           default if the support is detected when configuring GCC, and, in the case of 32-bit PowerPC,  if  GCC
           is  configured  with  <b>--enable-secureplt</b>.   <b>-mpltseq</b>  code  and  <b>-mbss-plt</b> 32-bit PowerPC relocatable
           objects may not be linked together.

       <b>-mtls-markers</b>
       <b>-mno-tls-markers</b>
           Mark (do not mark) calls to "__tls_get_addr" with a relocation specifying the function argument.  The
           relocation allows the linker to reliably associate function call with argument setup instructions for
           TLS optimization, which in turn allows GCC to better schedule the sequence.

       <b>-mrecip</b>
       <b>-mno-recip</b>
           This option enables use of the reciprocal estimate and reciprocal square root  estimate  instructions
           with  additional  Newton-Raphson steps to increase precision instead of doing a divide or square root
           and divide for floating-point arguments.  You should use the <b>-ffast-math</b> option  when  using  <b>-mrecip</b>
           (or    at    least    <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations</b>,    <b>-ffinite-math-only</b>,    <b>-freciprocal-math</b>    and
           <b>-fno-trapping-math</b>).  Note that while the throughput of the sequence is  generally  higher  than  the
           throughput of the non-reciprocal instruction, the precision of the sequence can be decreased by up to
           2 ulp (i.e. the inverse of 1.0 equals 0.99999994) for reciprocal square roots.

       <b>-mrecip=</b><u>opt</u>
           This  option  controls  which reciprocal estimate instructions may be used.  <u>opt</u> is a comma-separated
           list of options, which may be preceded by a "!" to invert the option:

           <b>all</b> Enable all estimate instructions.

           <b>default</b>
               Enable the default instructions, equivalent to <b>-mrecip</b>.

           <b>none</b>
               Disable all estimate instructions, equivalent to <b>-mno-recip</b>.

           <b>div</b> Enable the reciprocal approximation instructions for both single and double precision.

           <b>divf</b>
               Enable the single-precision reciprocal approximation instructions.

           <b>divd</b>
               Enable the double-precision reciprocal approximation instructions.

           <b>rsqrt</b>
               Enable the  reciprocal  square  root  approximation  instructions  for  both  single  and  double
               precision.

           <b>rsqrtf</b>
               Enable the single-precision reciprocal square root approximation instructions.

           <b>rsqrtd</b>
               Enable the double-precision reciprocal square root approximation instructions.

           So,  for example, <b>-mrecip=all,!rsqrtd</b> enables all of the reciprocal estimate instructions, except for
           the  "FRSQRTE",  "XSRSQRTEDP",  and  "XVRSQRTEDP"  instructions  which  handle  the  double-precision
           reciprocal square root calculations.

       <b>-mrecip-precision</b>
       <b>-mno-recip-precision</b>
           Assume  (do  not assume) that the reciprocal estimate instructions provide higher-precision estimates
           than  is  mandated  by  the  PowerPC  ABI.   Selecting  <b>-mcpu=power6</b>,  <b>-mcpu=power7</b>  or  <b>-mcpu=power8</b>
           automatically  selects <b>-mrecip-precision</b>.  The double-precision square root estimate instructions are
           not generated by default on low-precision machines, since  they  do  not  provide  an  estimate  that
           converges after three steps.

       <b>-mveclibabi=</b><u>type</u>
           Specifies  the  ABI  type to use for vectorizing intrinsics using an external library.  The only type
           supported at present is <b>mass</b>, which specifies to use IBM's Mathematical Acceleration Subsystem (MASS)
           libraries for vectorizing  intrinsics  using  external  libraries.   GCC  currently  emits  calls  to
           "acosd2",  "acosf4",  "acoshd2",  "acoshf4",  "asind2",  "asinf4",  "asinhd2",  "asinhf4", "atan2d2",

           "sqrtd2", "sqrtf4", "tand2", "tanf4", "tanhd2", and "tanhf4" when generating code for  power7.   Both
           <b>-ftree-vectorize</b>  and  <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations</b>  must also be enabled.  The MASS libraries must be
           specified at link time.

       <b>-mfriz</b>
       <b>-mno-friz</b>
           Generate (do not generate) the "friz" instruction when the <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations</b> option is used
           to optimize rounding of floating-point values to 64-bit integer and  back  to  floating  point.   The
           "friz" instruction does not return the same value if the floating-point number is too large to fit in
           an integer.

       <b>-mpointers-to-nested-functions</b>
       <b>-mno-pointers-to-nested-functions</b>
           Generate  (do  not generate) code to load up the static chain register ("r11") when calling through a
           pointer on AIX and 64-bit Linux systems where a function pointer points to a 3-word descriptor giving
           the function address, TOC value to be loaded in register "r2", and static chain value to be loaded in
           register "r11".  The <b>-mpointers-to-nested-functions</b> is  on  by  default.   You  cannot  call  through
           pointers to nested functions or pointers to functions compiled in other languages that use the static
           chain if you use <b>-mno-pointers-to-nested-functions</b>.

       <b>-msave-toc-indirect</b>
       <b>-mno-save-toc-indirect</b>
           Generate  (do not generate) code to save the TOC value in the reserved stack location in the function
           prologue if the function calls through a pointer on AIX and 64-bit Linux systems.  If the  TOC  value
           is  not  saved  in  the  prologue,  it  is  saved  just  before  the  call  through the pointer.  The
           <b>-mno-save-toc-indirect</b> option is the default.

       <b>-mcompat-align-parm</b>
       <b>-mno-compat-align-parm</b>
           Generate (do not generate) code to pass structure parameters with a maximum alignment of 64 bits, for
           compatibility with older versions of GCC.

           Older versions of GCC (prior to 4.9.0) incorrectly did not align a structure parameter on  a  128-bit
           boundary  when  that  structure contained a member requiring 128-bit alignment.  This is corrected in
           more recent versions of GCC.  This option may be used  to  generate  code  that  is  compatible  with
           functions compiled with older versions of GCC.

           The <b>-mno-compat-align-parm</b> option is the default.

       <b>-mstack-protector-guard=</b><u>guard</u>
       <b>-mstack-protector-guard-reg=</b><u>reg</u>
       <b>-mstack-protector-guard-offset=</b><u>offset</u>
       <b>-mstack-protector-guard-symbol=</b><u>symbol</u>
           Generate  stack  protection  code  using  canary at <u>guard</u>.  Supported locations are <b>global</b> for global
           canary or <b>tls</b> for per-thread canary in the TLS block (the  default  with  GNU  libc  version  2.4  or
           later).

           With      the      latter      choice     the     options     <b>-mstack-protector-guard-reg=</b><u>reg</u>     and
           <b>-mstack-protector-guard-offset=</b><u>offset</u> furthermore specify which register to use as base register  for
           reading  the  canary,  and  from  what  offset  from  that base register. The default for those is as
           specified in the relevant ABI.  <b>-mstack-protector-guard-symbol=</b><u>symbol</u> overrides  the  offset  with  a
           symbol reference to a canary in the TLS block.

       <b>-mpcrel</b>
       <b>-mno-pcrel</b>
           Generate  (do not generate) pc-relative addressing.  The <b>-mpcrel</b> option requires that the medium code
           model (<b>-mcmodel=medium</b>) and prefixed addressing (<b>-mprefixed</b>) options are enabled.

       <b>-mprefixed</b>
       <b>-mno-prefixed</b>
           Generate (do not generate)  addressing  modes  using  prefixed  load  and  store  instructions.   The
           <b>-mprefixed</b> option requires that the option <b>-mcpu=power10</b> (or later) is enabled.

       <b>-mmma</b>
       <b>-mno-mma</b>
           Generate  (do  not  generate)  the  MMA  instructions.   The  <b>-mma</b>  option  requires  that the option
           <b>-mcpu=power10</b> (or later) is enabled.

       <b>-mrop-protect</b>
       <b>-mno-rop-protect</b>
           Generate (do not generate) ROP protection instructions  when  the  target  processor  supports  them.
           Currently this option disables the shrink-wrap optimization (<b>-fshrink-wrap</b>).

       <b>-mprivileged</b>
       <b>-mno-privileged</b>
           Generate (do not generate) code that will run in privileged state.

       <b>-mblock-ops-unaligned-vsx</b>
       <b>-mno-block-ops-unaligned-vsx</b>
           Generate  (do  not  generate)  unaligned  vsx  loads  and stores for inline expansion of "memcpy" and
           "memmove".

       <u>RX</u> <u>Options</u>

       These command-line options are defined for RX targets:

       <b>-m64bit-doubles</b>
       <b>-m32bit-doubles</b>
           Make the "double" data type be 64 bits (<b>-m64bit-doubles</b>) or 32 bits (<b>-m32bit-doubles</b>) in  size.   The
           default  is  <b>-m32bit-doubles</b>.   <u>Note</u> RX floating-point hardware only works on 32-bit values, which is
           why the default is <b>-m32bit-doubles</b>.

       <b>-fpu</b>
       <b>-nofpu</b>
           Enables (<b>-fpu</b>) or disables (<b>-nofpu</b>) the use of RX floating-point hardware.  The  default  is  enabled
           for the RX600 series and disabled for the RX200 series.

           Floating-point  instructions are only generated for 32-bit floating-point values, however, so the FPU
           hardware is not used for doubles if the <b>-m64bit-doubles</b> option is used.

           <u>Note</u> If the <b>-fpu</b> option is enabled then <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations</b> is  also  enabled  automatically.
           This is because the RX FPU instructions are themselves unsafe.

       <b>-mcpu=</b><u>name</u>
           Selects  the  type  of RX CPU to be targeted.  Currently three types are supported, the generic <b>RX600</b>
           and <b>RX200</b> series hardware and the specific <b>RX610</b> CPU.  The default is <b>RX600</b>.

           The only difference between <b>RX600</b> and  <b>RX610</b>  is  that  the  <b>RX610</b>  does  not  support  the  "MVTIPL"
           instruction.

           The  <b>RX200</b>  series  does  not have a hardware floating-point unit and so <b>-nofpu</b> is enabled by default
           when this type is selected.

       <b>-mbig-endian-data</b>
       <b>-mlittle-endian-data</b>
           Store data (but not code) in the big-endian format.  The default  is  <b>-mlittle-endian-data</b>,  i.e.  to
           store data in the little-endian format.

       <b>-msmall-data-limit=</b><u>N</u>
           Specifies the maximum size in bytes of global and static variables which can be placed into the small
           data  area.   Using  the small data area can lead to smaller and faster code, but the size of area is
           limited and it is up to the programmer to ensure that the area does  not  overflow.   Also  when  the
           small  data  area  is  used one of the RX's registers (usually "r13") is reserved for use pointing to
           this area, so it is no longer available for use by the compiler.  This could result in slower  and/or
           larger code if variables are pushed onto the stack instead of being held in this register.

           Note,  common  variables (variables that have not been initialized) and constants are not placed into
           the small data area as they are assigned to other sections in the output executable.

           The default value is zero, which disables this feature.  Note, this feature is not enabled by default
           with higher optimization levels (<b>-O2</b> etc) because of the potentially detrimental effects of reserving
           a register.  It is up to the programmer to experiment and discover whether this feature is of benefit
           to their program.  See the description of the <b>-mpid</b> option  for  a  description  of  how  the  actual
           register to hold the small data area pointer is chosen.

       <b>-msim</b>
       <b>-mno-sim</b>
           Use the simulator runtime.  The default is to use the libgloss board-specific runtime.

       <b>-mas100-syntax</b>
       <b>-mno-as100-syntax</b>
           When  generating  assembler  output  use  a syntax that is compatible with Renesas's AS100 assembler.
           This syntax can also be handled by the GAS assembler, but it has  some  restrictions  so  it  is  not
           generated by default.

       <b>-mmax-constant-size=</b><u>N</u>
           Specifies  the  maximum  size,  in  bytes,  of  a  constant  that  can  be used as an operand in a RX
           instruction.  Although the RX instruction set does allow constants of up to 4 bytes in length  to  be
           used  in instructions, a longer value equates to a longer instruction.  Thus in some circumstances it
           can be beneficial to restrict the size of constants that are used in  instructions.   Constants  that
           are too big are instead placed into a constant pool and referenced via register indirection.

           The value <u>N</u> can be between 0 and 4.  A value of 0 (the default) or 4 means that constants of any size
           are allowed.

       <b>-mrelax</b>
           Enable  linker  relaxation.  Linker relaxation is a process whereby the linker attempts to reduce the
           size of a program by finding shorter versions of various instructions.  Disabled by default.

       <b>-mint-register=</b><u>N</u>
           Specify the number of registers to reserve for fast interrupt handler functions.  The value <u>N</u> can  be
           between  0  and  4.  A value of 1 means that register "r13" is reserved for the exclusive use of fast
           interrupt handlers.  A value of 2 reserves "r13" and "r12".  A value of 3 reserves "r13",  "r12"  and
           "r11",  and  a  value of 4 reserves "r13" through "r10".  A value of 0, the default, does not reserve
           any registers.

       <b>-msave-acc-in-interrupts</b>
           Specifies that interrupt handler functions should preserve the accumulator register.   This  is  only
           necessary  if  normal code might use the accumulator register, for example because it performs 64-bit
           multiplications.  The default is to ignore the accumulator  as  this  makes  the  interrupt  handlers
           faster.

       <b>-mpid</b>
       <b>-mno-pid</b>
           Enables  the  generation  of  position independent data.  When enabled any access to constant data is
           done via an offset from a base address held in a register.  This allows the location of constant data
           to be determined at run time without requiring the executable to be relocated, which is a benefit  to
           embedded  applications  with  tight memory constraints.  Data that can be modified is not affected by
           this option.

           Note, using this feature reserves a register, usually "r13", for  the  constant  data  base  address.
           This can result in slower and/or larger code, especially in complicated functions.

           The  actual  register  chosen  to  hold  the  constant  data  base  address  depends upon whether the
           <b>-msmall-data-limit</b> and/or  the  <b>-mint-register</b>  command-line  options  are  enabled.   Starting  with
           register "r13" and proceeding downwards, registers are allocated first to satisfy the requirements of
           <b>-mint-register</b>,  then  <b>-mpid</b>  and finally <b>-msmall-data-limit</b>.  Thus it is possible for the small data
           area register to be "r8" if both <b>-mint-register=4</b> and <b>-mpid</b> are specified on the command line.

           By default this feature is not enabled.  The default can be restored via  the  <b>-mno-pid</b>  command-line
           option.

       <b>-mno-warn-multiple-fast-interrupts</b>
       <b>-mwarn-multiple-fast-interrupts</b>
           Prevents  GCC from issuing a warning message if it finds more than one fast interrupt handler when it
           is compiling a file.  The default is to issue a warning for each extra fast interrupt handler  found,
           as the RX only supports one such interrupt.

       <b>-mallow-string-insns</b>
       <b>-mno-allow-string-insns</b>
           Enables  or  disables  the  use  of  the  string manipulation instructions "SMOVF", "SCMPU", "SMOVB",
           "SMOVU", "SUNTIL" "SWHILE" and also the "RMPA" instruction.  These instructions  may  prefetch  data,
           which  is not safe to do if accessing an I/O register.  (See section 12.2.7 of the RX62N Group User's
           Manual for more information).

           The default is to allow these instructions, but it is not possible for GCC  to  reliably  detect  all
           circumstances where a string instruction might be used to access an I/O register, so their use cannot
           be   disabled   automatically.    Instead   it   is   reliant   upon   the   programmer  to  use  the
           <b>-mno-allow-string-insns</b> option if their program accesses I/O space.

           When the instructions are enabled GCC defines the C preprocessor symbol  "__RX_ALLOW_STRING_INSNS__",
           otherwise it defines the symbol "__RX_DISALLOW_STRING_INSNS__".

       <b>-mjsr</b>
       <b>-mno-jsr</b>
           Use  only  (or  not  only) "JSR" instructions to access functions.  This option can be used when code
           size exceeds the range of "BSR" instructions.  Note that <b>-mno-jsr</b> does not mean to not use "JSR"  but
           instead means that any type of branch may be used.

       <u>Note:</u>  The  generic GCC command-line option <b>-ffixed-</b><u>reg</u> has special significance to the RX port when used
       with the "interrupt" function attribute.  This attribute indicates a function intended  to  process  fast
       interrupts.   GCC  ensures  that  it  only  uses  the registers "r10", "r11", "r12" and/or "r13" and only
       provided that the normal use of the corresponding registers have been restricted via the  <b>-ffixed-</b><u>reg</u>  or
       <b>-mint-register</b> command-line options.

       <u>S/390</u> <u>and</u> <u>zSeries</u> <u>Options</u>

       These are the <b>-m</b> options defined for the S/390 and zSeries architecture.

       <b>-mhard-float</b>
       <b>-msoft-float</b>
           Use  (do  not  use)  the  hardware  floating-point  instructions  and  registers  for  floating-point
           operations.  When <b>-msoft-float</b> is specified, functions in <u>libgcc.a</u> are used to perform floating-point
           operations.  When <b>-mhard-float</b> is specified, the compiler generates IEEE floating-point instructions.
           This is the default.

       <b>-mhard-dfp</b>
       <b>-mno-hard-dfp</b>
           Use  (do  not  use)  the  hardware  decimal-floating-point  instructions  for  decimal-floating-point
           operations.   When  <b>-mno-hard-dfp</b>  is  specified,  functions in <u>libgcc.a</u> are used to perform decimal-
           floating-point operations.  When <b>-mhard-dfp</b> is specified, the  compiler  generates  decimal-floating-
           point hardware instructions.  This is the default for <b>-march=z9-ec</b> or higher.

       <b>-mlong-double-64</b>
       <b>-mlong-double-128</b>
           These switches control the size of "long double" type. A size of 64 bits makes the "long double" type
           equivalent to the "double" type. This is the default.

       <b>-mbackchain</b>
       <b>-mno-backchain</b>
           Store  (do  not store) the address of the caller's frame as backchain pointer into the callee's stack
           frame.  A backchain may be needed to allow debugging using tools that do not  understand  DWARF  call
           frame  information.   When  <b>-mno-packed-stack</b>  is  in  effect, the backchain pointer is stored at the
           bottom of the stack frame; when <b>-mpacked-stack</b> is in effect, the backchain is placed into the topmost
           word of the 96/160 byte register save area.

           In general, code compiled with <b>-mbackchain</b> is call-compatible with code compiled with <b>-mno-backchain</b>;
           however, use of the backchain for debugging purposes usually requires that the whole binary is  built
           with  <b>-mbackchain</b>.   Note that the combination of <b>-mbackchain</b>, <b>-mpacked-stack</b> and <b>-mhard-float</b> is not
           supported.  In order to build a linux kernel use <b>-msoft-float</b>.

           The default is to not maintain the backchain.

       <b>-mpacked-stack</b>
       <b>-mno-packed-stack</b>
           Use (do not use) the packed stack layout.  When <b>-mno-packed-stack</b> is specified, the compiler uses the
           all fields of the 96/160 byte register save area only for their default purpose; unused fields  still
           take up stack space.  When <b>-mpacked-stack</b> is specified, register save slots are densely packed at the
           top of the register save area; unused space is reused for other purposes, allowing for more efficient
           use  of  the available stack space.  However, when <b>-mbackchain</b> is also in effect, the topmost word of
           the save area is always used to store the backchain, and the return address register is always  saved
           two words below the backchain.

           As  long  as  the  stack  frame  backchain  is  not used, code generated with <b>-mpacked-stack</b> is call-
           compatible with code generated with <b>-mno-packed-stack</b>.  Note that some non-FSF releases of  GCC  2.95
           for  S/390  or  zSeries  generated code that uses the stack frame backchain at run time, not just for
           debugging purposes.  Such code is not call-compatible with code compiled with <b>-mpacked-stack</b>.   Also,
           note that the combination of <b>-mbackchain</b>, <b>-mpacked-stack</b> and <b>-mhard-float</b> is not supported.  In order
           to build a linux kernel use <b>-msoft-float</b>.

           The default is to not use the packed stack layout.

       <b>-msmall-exec</b>
       <b>-mno-small-exec</b>
           Generate  (or  do  not generate) code using the "bras" instruction to do subroutine calls.  This only
           works reliably if the total executable size does not exceed 64k.  The default is to  use  the  "basr"
           instruction instead, which does not have this limitation.

       <b>-m64</b>
       <b>-m31</b>
           When  <b>-m31</b>  is  specified,  generate  code  compliant  to  the GNU/Linux for S/390 ABI.  When <b>-m64</b> is
           specified, generate code compliant to the GNU/Linux for zSeries ABI.  This allows GCC  in  particular
           to  generate 64-bit instructions.  For the <b>s390</b> targets, the default is <b>-m31</b>, while the <b>s390x</b> targets
           default to <b>-m64</b>.

       <b>-mzarch</b>
       <b>-mesa</b>
           When <b>-mzarch</b> is specified, generate code using the instructions available  on  z/Architecture.   When
           <b>-mesa</b>  is  specified,  generate code using the instructions available on ESA/390.  Note that <b>-mesa</b> is
           not possible with <b>-m64</b>.  When generating code compliant to the GNU/Linux for S/390 ABI,  the  default
           is <b>-mesa</b>.  When generating code compliant to the GNU/Linux for zSeries ABI, the default is <b>-mzarch</b>.

       <b>-mhtm</b>
       <b>-mno-htm</b>
           The  <b>-mhtm</b>  option  enables  a  set  of  builtins  making  use  of  instructions  available  with the
           transactional execution facility introduced with the IBM zEnterprise EC12  machine  generation  <b>S/390</b>
           <b>System</b> <b>z</b> <b>Built-in</b> <b>Functions</b>.  <b>-mhtm</b> is enabled by default when using <b>-march=zEC12</b>.

       <b>-mvx</b>
       <b>-mno-vx</b>
           When  <b>-mvx</b>  is  specified,  generate  code using the instructions available with the vector extension
           facility introduced with the IBM z13 machine generation.  This option changes the ABI for some vector
           type values with regard to alignment and calling conventions.  In case vector type values  are  being
           used  in  an  ABI-relevant  context  a GAS <b>.gnu_attribute</b> command will be added to mark the resulting
           binary with the ABI used.  <b>-mvx</b> is enabled by default when using <b>-march=z13</b>.

       <b>-mzvector</b>
       <b>-mno-zvector</b>
           The <b>-mzvector</b> option enables vector language extensions and  builtins  using  instructions  available
           with  the vector extension facility introduced with the IBM z13 machine generation.  This option adds
           support for <b>vector</b> to be used as a keyword to define vector type variables and arguments.  <b>vector</b>  is
           only  available  when  GNU  extensions  are  enabled.  It will not be expanded when requesting strict
           standard compliance e.g. with <b>-std=c99</b>.  In addition to the GCC low-level builtins <b>-mzvector</b>  enables
           a set of builtins added for compatibility with AltiVec-style implementations like Power and Cell.  In
           order  to  make use of these builtins the header file <u>vecintrin.h</u> needs to be included.  <b>-mzvector</b> is
           disabled by default.

       <b>-mmvcle</b>
       <b>-mno-mvcle</b>
           Generate (or do not generate) code using the  "mvcle"  instruction  to  perform  block  moves.   When
           <b>-mno-mvcle</b> is specified, use a "mvc" loop instead.  This is the default unless optimizing for size.

       <b>-mdebug</b>
       <b>-mno-debug</b>
           Print  (or  do  not  print) additional debug information when compiling.  The default is to not print
           debug information.

       <b>-march=</b><u>cpu-type</u>
           Generate code that runs on <u>cpu-type</u>, which is the name of a system representing a  certain  processor
           type.   Possible  values  for  <u>cpu-type</u>  are  <b>z900</b>/<b>arch5</b>, <b>z990</b>/<b>arch6</b>, <b>z9-109</b>, <b>z9-ec</b>/<b>arch7</b>, <b>z10</b>/<b>arch8</b>,
           <b>z196</b>/<b>arch9</b>, <b>zEC12</b>, <b>z13</b>/<b>arch11</b>, <b>z14</b>/<b>arch12</b>, <b>z15</b>/<b>arch13</b>, <b>z16</b>/<b>arch14</b>, and <b>native</b>.

           The default is <b>-march=z900</b>.

           Specifying <b>native</b> as cpu type can be used to  select  the  best  architecture  option  for  the  host
           processor.  <b>-march=native</b> has no effect if GCC does not recognize the processor.

       <b>-mtune=</b><u>cpu-type</u>
           Tune  to  <u>cpu-type</u>  everything applicable about the generated code, except for the ABI and the set of
           available instructions.  The list of <u>cpu-type</u> values is the same as for <b>-march</b>.  The default  is  the
           value used for <b>-march</b>.

       <b>-mtpf-trace</b>
       <b>-mno-tpf-trace</b>
           Generate code that adds (does not add) in TPF OS specific branches to trace routines in the operating
           system.  This option is off by default, even when compiling for the TPF OS.

       <b>-mtpf-trace-skip</b>
       <b>-mno-tpf-trace-skip</b>
           Generate  code  that  changes  (does not change) the default branch targets enabled by <b>-mtpf-trace</b> to
           point to specialized trace routines providing the ability  of  selectively  skipping  function  trace
           entries  for  the  TPF  OS.   This  option  is off by default, even when compiling for the TPF OS and
           specifying <b>-mtpf-trace</b>.

       <b>-mfused-madd</b>
       <b>-mno-fused-madd</b>
           Generate code that uses (does not use)  the  floating-point  multiply  and  accumulate  instructions.
           These instructions are generated by default if hardware floating point is used.

       <b>-mwarn-framesize=</b><u>framesize</u>
           Emit  a warning if the current function exceeds the given frame size.  Because this is a compile-time
           check it doesn't need to be a real problem when  the  program  runs.   It  is  intended  to  identify
           functions  that most probably cause a stack overflow.  It is useful to be used in an environment with
           limited stack size e.g. the linux kernel.

       <b>-mwarn-dynamicstack</b>
           Emit a warning if the function calls "alloca" or uses dynamically-sized arrays.  This is generally  a
           bad idea with a limited stack size.

       <b>-mstack-guard=</b><u>stack-guard</u>
       <b>-mstack-size=</b><u>stack-size</u>
           If  these  options  are  provided  the  S/390  back end emits additional instructions in the function
           prologue that trigger a trap if the stack size is <u>stack-guard</u> bytes above  the  <u>stack-size</u>  (remember
           that  the stack on S/390 grows downward).  If the <u>stack-guard</u> option is omitted the smallest power of
           2 larger than the frame size of the compiled function is chosen.  These options are  intended  to  be
           used  to  help  debugging  stack overflow problems.  The additionally emitted code causes only little
           overhead and  hence  can  also  be  used  in  production-like  systems  without  greater  performance
           degradation.   The  given  values  have to be exact powers of 2 and <u>stack-size</u> has to be greater than
           <u>stack-guard</u> without exceeding 64k.  In order to be efficient the extra code makes the assumption that
           the stack starts at an address aligned to the value given by <u>stack-size</u>.  The <u>stack-guard</u> option  can
           only be used in conjunction with <u>stack-size</u>.

       <b>-mhotpatch=</b><u>pre-halfwords</u><b>,</b><u>post-halfwords</u>
           If  the hotpatch option is enabled, a "hot-patching" function prologue is generated for all functions
           in the compilation unit.  The funtion label is prepended  with  the  given  number  of  two-byte  NOP
           instructions  (<u>pre-halfwords</u>,  maximum  1000000).   After  the  label,  2  * <u>post-halfwords</u> bytes are
           appended, using the largest NOP like instructions the architecture allows (maximum 1000000).

           If both arguments are zero, hotpatching is disabled.

           This option can be overridden for individual functions with the "hotpatch" attribute.

       <u>Score</u> <u>Options</u>

       These options are defined for Score implementations:

       <b>-meb</b>
           Compile code for big-endian mode.  This is the default.

       <b>-mel</b>
           Compile code for little-endian mode.

           Generate code for SH4-340 (no MMU, no FPU).

       <b>-m4-500</b>
           Generate code for SH4-500 (no FPU).  Passes <b>-isa=sh4-nofpu</b> to the assembler.

       <b>-m4a-nofpu</b>
           Generate code for the SH4al-dsp, or for a SH4a in such a way that  the  floating-point  unit  is  not

           Generate  code  for  the  SH4a,  in such a way that no double-precision floating-point operations are
           used.

       <b>-m4a-single</b>
           Generate code for the SH4a assuming the floating-point unit is in single-precision mode by default.

       <b>-m4a</b>
           Generate code for the SH4a.

       <b>-m4al</b>
           Same as <b>-m4a-nofpu</b>, except that it implicitly passes <b>-dsp</b> to the assembler.  GCC doesn't generate any
           DSP instructions at the moment.

       <b>-mb</b> Compile code for the processor in big-endian mode.

       <b>-ml</b> Compile code for the processor in little-endian mode.

       <b>-mdalign</b>
           Align doubles at 64-bit boundaries.  Note that this changes the calling conventions,  and  thus  some
           functions from the standard C library do not work unless you recompile it first with <b>-mdalign</b>.

       <b>-mrelax</b>
           Shorten some address references at link time, when possible; uses the linker option <b>-relax</b>.

       <b>-mbigtable</b>
           Use 32-bit offsets in "switch" tables.  The default is to use 16-bit offsets.

       <b>-mbitops</b>
           Enable the use of bit manipulation instructions on SH2A.

       <b>-mfmovd</b>
           Enable the use of the instruction "fmovd".  Check <b>-mdalign</b> for alignment constraints.

       <b>-mrenesas</b>
           Comply with the calling conventions defined by Renesas.

       <b>-mno-renesas</b>
           Comply  with  the  calling conventions defined for GCC before the Renesas conventions were available.
           This option is the default for all targets of the SH toolchain.

       <b>-mnomacsave</b>
           Mark the "MAC" register as call-clobbered, even if <b>-mrenesas</b> is given.

       <b>-mieee</b>
       <b>-mno-ieee</b>
           Control the IEEE compliance of floating-point comparisons, which affects the handling of cases  where
           the   result   of  a  comparison  is  unordered.   By  default  <b>-mieee</b>  is  implicitly  enabled.   If
           <b>-ffinite-math-only</b> is enabled <b>-mno-ieee</b> is implicitly set, which  results  in  faster  floating-point
           greater-equal  and  less-equal  comparisons.   The  implicit settings can be overridden by specifying
           either <b>-mieee</b> or <b>-mno-ieee</b>.

       <b>-minline-ic_invalidate</b>
           Inline code to invalidate instruction cache entries after setting  up  nested  function  trampolines.
           This  option  has  no effect if <b>-musermode</b> is in effect and the selected code generation option (e.g.
           <b>-m4</b>) does not allow the use of the "icbi" instruction.  If the selected code generation  option  does
           not  allow  the  use  of  the  "icbi"  instruction, and <b>-musermode</b> is not in effect, the inlined code
           manipulates the instruction cache address array directly with an associative write.   This  not  only
           requires privileged mode at run time, but it also fails if the cache line had been mapped via the TLB
           and has become unmapped.

       <b>-misize</b>
           Dump instruction size and location in the assembly code.

       <b>-mpadstruct</b>
           This option is deprecated.  It pads structures to multiple of 4 bytes, which is incompatible with the
           SH ABI.

       <b>-matomic-model=</b><u>model</u>
           Sets the model of atomic operations and additional parameters as a comma separated list.  For details
           on  the  atomic  built-in  functions  see <b>__atomic</b> <b>Builtins</b>.  The following models and parameters are
           supported:

           <b>none</b>
               Disable compiler generated atomic sequences and emit library calls for atomic  operations.   This
               is the default if the target is not "sh*-*-linux*".

           <b>soft-gusa</b>
               Generate  GNU/Linux  compatible gUSA software atomic sequences for the atomic built-in functions.
               The generated atomic sequences require additional support from the  interrupt/exception  handling
               code  of  the system and are only suitable for SH3* and SH4* single-core systems.  This option is
               enabled by default when the target is "sh*-*-linux*" and SH3* or SH4*.  When the target is  SH4A,
               this  option  also partially utilizes the hardware atomic instructions "movli.l" and "movco.l" to
               create more efficient code, unless <b>strict</b> is specified.

           <b>soft-tcb</b>
               Generate software atomic sequences that use a variable in the thread control block.   This  is  a
               variation  of  the gUSA sequences which can also be used on SH1* and SH2* targets.  The generated
               atomic sequences require additional support from the interrupt/exception  handling  code  of  the
               system  and  are  only  suitable for single-core systems.  When using this model, the <b>gbr-offset=</b>
               parameter has to be specified as well.

           <b>soft-imask</b>
               Generate software atomic sequences that temporarily disable interrupts  by  setting  "SR.IMASK  =
               1111".   This  model works only when the program runs in privileged mode and is only suitable for
               single-core systems.  Additional support from the interrupt/exception handling code of the system
               is not required.  This model is enabled by default when the target is "sh*-*-linux*" and SH1*  or
               SH2*.

           <b>hard-llcs</b>
               Generate  hardware atomic sequences using the "movli.l" and "movco.l" instructions only.  This is
               only available on SH4A and is suitable for multi-core systems.  Since the  hardware  instructions
               support  only  32  bit  atomic  variables access to 8 or 16 bit variables is emulated with 32 bit
               accesses.  Code compiled with this option is also compatible with  other  software  atomic  model
               interrupt/exception  handling systems if executed on an SH4A system.  Additional support from the
               interrupt/exception handling code of the system is not required for this model.

           <b>gbr-offset=</b>
               This parameter specifies the offset in  bytes  of  the  variable  in  the  thread  control  block
               structure  that should be used by the generated atomic sequences when the <b>soft-tcb</b> model has been
               selected.  For other models this parameter is ignored.  The specified value must  be  an  integer
               multiple of four and in the range 0-1020.

           <b>strict</b>
               This  parameter  prevents mixed usage of multiple atomic models, even if they are compatible, and
               makes the compiler generate atomic sequences of the specified model only.

       <b>-mtas</b>
           Generate the "tas.b" opcode for "__atomic_test_and_set".  Notice that  depending  on  the  particular
           hardware  and  software  configuration  this can degrade overall performance due to the operand cache
           line flushes that are implied by the "tas.b" instruction.  On multi-core SH4A processors the  "tas.b"
           instruction  must  be  used  with  caution  since  it can result in data corruption for certain cache
           configurations.

       <b>-mprefergot</b>
           When generating position-independent code, emit function calls using the Global Offset Table  instead
           of the Procedure Linkage Table.

       <b>-musermode</b>
       <b>-mno-usermode</b>
           Don't allow (allow) the compiler generating privileged mode code.  Specifying <b>-musermode</b> also implies
           <b>-mno-inline-ic_invalidate</b> if the inlined code would not work in user mode.  <b>-musermode</b> is the default
           when  the  target  is  "sh*-*-linux*".  If the target is SH1* or SH2* <b>-musermode</b> has no effect, since
           there is no user mode.

       <b>-multcost=</b><u>number</u>
           Set the cost to assume for a multiply insn.

       <b>-mdiv=</b><u>strategy</u>
           Set the division strategy to be used for integer division operations.  <u>strategy</u> can be one of:

           <b>call-div1</b>
               Calls a library function that uses the single-step division instruction  "div1"  to  perform  the
               operation.   Division  by  zero  calculates an unspecified result and does not trap.  This is the
               default except for SH4, SH2A and SHcompact.

           <b>call-fp</b>
               Calls a library function  that  performs  the  operation  in  double  precision  floating  point.
               Division  by zero causes a floating-point exception.  This is the default for SHcompact with FPU.
               Specifying this for targets that do not have a double precision FPU defaults to "call-div1".

           <b>call-table</b>
               Calls a library function that uses a lookup table for small divisors and the  "div1"  instruction
               with case distinction for larger divisors.  Division by zero calculates an unspecified result and
               does  not  trap.   This  is  the  default  for SH4.  Specifying this for targets that do not have
               dynamic shift instructions defaults to "call-div1".

           When a division strategy has not been specified the default strategy is selected based on the current
           target.  For SH2A the default strategy is to use  the  "divs"  and  "divu"  instructions  instead  of
           library function calls.

       <b>-maccumulate-outgoing-args</b>
           Reserve  space  once  for  outgoing  arguments in the function prologue rather than around each call.
           Generally beneficial for performance and size.  Also needed for unwinding to avoid changing the stack
           frame around conditional code.

       <b>-mdivsi3_libfunc=</b><u>name</u>
           Set the name of the library function used for 32-bit signed division to <u>name</u>.  This only affects  the
           name  used  in  the  <b>call</b>  division  strategies,  and  the  compiler  still  expects the same sets of
           input/output/clobbered registers as if this option were not present.

       <b>-mfixed-range=</b><u>register-range</u>
           Generate code treating the given register range as fixed registers.  A fixed register is one that the
           register allocator cannot use.  This is useful when compiling  kernel  code.   A  register  range  is
           specified  as two registers separated by a dash.  Multiple register ranges can be specified separated
           by a comma.

       <b>-mbranch-cost=</b><u>num</u>
           Assume <u>num</u> to be the cost for a branch instruction.  Higher numbers make the compiler try to generate
           more branch-free code if possible.  If not specified the value is selected depending on the processor
           type that is being compiled for.

       <b>-mzdcbranch</b>
       <b>-mno-zdcbranch</b>
           Assume (do not assume) that zero displacement conditional branch instructions "bt" and "bf" are fast.
           If <b>-mzdcbranch</b> is specified, the compiler prefers zero displacement branch code sequences.   This  is
           enabled  by  default  when  generating  code  for  SH4  and  SH4A.   It can be explicitly disabled by
           specifying <b>-mno-zdcbranch</b>.

       <b>-mcbranch-force-delay-slot</b>
           Force the usage of delay slots for conditional branches, which stuffs the delay slot with a "nop"  if
           a  suitable  instruction  cannot be found.  By default this option is disabled.  It can be enabled to
           work around hardware bugs as found in the original SH7055.

       <b>-mfused-madd</b>
       <b>-mno-fused-madd</b>
           Generate code that uses (does not use)  the  floating-point  multiply  and  accumulate  instructions.
           These  instructions  are  generated  by  default  if  hardware  floating point is used.  The machine-
           dependent <b>-mfused-madd</b> option is now mapped to the machine-independent <b>-ffp-contract=fast</b> option, and
           <b>-mno-fused-madd</b> is mapped to <b>-ffp-contract=off</b>.

       <b>-mfsca</b>
       <b>-mno-fsca</b>
           Allow or disallow the compiler to emit the "fsca" instruction for  sine  and  cosine  approximations.
           The  option  <b>-mfsca</b>  must  be used in combination with <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations</b>.  It is enabled by
           default when generating code for SH4A.  Using <b>-mno-fsca</b> disables sine and cosine approximations  even
           if <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations</b> is in effect.

       <b>-mfsrra</b>
       <b>-mno-fsrra</b>
           Allow  or  disallow  the  compiler  to  emit  the  "fsrra"  instruction  for  reciprocal  square root
           approximations.  The option <b>-mfsrra</b> must be used in combination with <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations</b>  and
           <b>-ffinite-math-only</b>.   It  is  enabled  by  default  when  generating code for SH4A.  Using <b>-mno-fsrra</b>
           disables  reciprocal   square   root   approximations   even   if   <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations</b>   and
           <b>-ffinite-math-only</b> are in effect.

       <b>-mpretend-cmove</b>
           Prefer  zero-displacement  conditional  branches for conditional move instruction patterns.  This can
           result in faster code on the SH4 processor.

       <b>-mfdpic</b>
           Generate code using the FDPIC ABI.

       <u>Solaris</u> <u>2</u> <u>Options</u>

       These <b>-m</b> options are supported on Solaris 2:

       <b>-mclear-hwcap</b>
           <b>-mclear-hwcap</b> tells the compiler to  remove  the  hardware  capabilities  generated  by  the  Solaris
           assembler.   This is only necessary when object files use ISA extensions not supported by the current
           machine, but check at runtime whether or not to use them.

       <b>-mimpure-text</b>
           <b>-mimpure-text</b>, used in addition to <b>-shared</b>, tells the compiler to not pass <b>-z</b> <b>text</b> to the linker when
           linking a shared object.  Using this option, you can  link  position-dependent  code  into  a  shared
           object.

           <b>-mimpure-text</b>  suppresses  the  "relocations  remain  against  allocatable but non-writable sections"
           linker error message.  However, the necessary  relocations  trigger  copy-on-write,  and  the  shared
           object  is  not actually shared across processes.  Instead of using <b>-mimpure-text</b>, you should compile
           all source code with <b>-fpic</b> or <b>-fPIC</b>.

       These switches are supported in addition to the above on Solaris 2:

       <b>-pthreads</b>
           This is a synonym for <b>-pthread</b>.

       <u>SPARC</u> <u>Options</u>

       These <b>-m</b> options are supported on the SPARC:

       <b>-mno-app-regs</b>
       <b>-mapp-regs</b>
           Specify <b>-mapp-regs</b> to generate output using the global registers 2 through 4, which  the  SPARC  SVR4
           ABI  reserves for applications.  Like the global register 1, each global register 2 through 4 is then
           treated as an allocable register that is clobbered by function calls.  This is the default.

           To be fully SVR4 ABI-compliant at the cost of some  performance  loss,  specify  <b>-mno-app-regs</b>.   You
           should compile libraries and system software with this option.

       <b>-mflat</b>
       <b>-mno-flat</b>
           With  <b>-mflat</b>,  the  compiler  does not generate save/restore instructions and uses a "flat" or single
           register window model.  This model is compatible with the regular register window model.   The  local
           registers and the input registers (0--5) are still treated as "call-saved" registers and are saved on
           the stack as needed.

           With  <b>-mno-flat</b>  (the  default),  the  compiler  generates save/restore instructions (except for leaf
           functions).  This is the normal operating mode.

       <b>-mfpu</b>
       <b>-mhard-float</b>
           Generate output containing floating-point instructions.  This is the default.

       <b>-mno-fpu</b>
       <b>-msoft-float</b>
           Generate output containing library calls for floating point.  <b>Warning:</b> the  requisite  libraries  are
           not  available  for all SPARC targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
           used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make your own arrangements  to
           provide  suitable  library  functions  for  cross-compilation.  The embedded targets <b>sparc-*-aout</b> and
           <b>sparclite-*-*</b> do provide software floating-point support.

           <b>-msoft-float</b> changes the calling convention in the output file; therefore, it is only useful  if  you
           compile  <u>all</u> of a program with this option.  In particular, you need to compile <u>libgcc.a</u>, the library
           that comes with GCC, with <b>-msoft-float</b> in order for this to work.

       <b>-mhard-quad-float</b>
           Generate output containing quad-word (long double) floating-point instructions.

       <b>-msoft-quad-float</b>
           Generate output containing library calls for quad-word  (long  double)  floating-point  instructions.
           The functions called are those specified in the SPARC ABI.  This is the default.

           As  of  this writing, there are no SPARC implementations that have hardware support for the quad-word
           floating-point instructions.  They all invoke a trap handler for one of these instructions, and  then
           the  trap handler emulates the effect of the instruction.  Because of the trap handler overhead, this
           is much slower than calling the ABI library routines.   Thus  the  <b>-msoft-quad-float</b>  option  is  the
           default.

       <b>-mno-unaligned-doubles</b>
       <b>-munaligned-doubles</b>
           Assume that doubles have 8-byte alignment.  This is the default.

           With  <b>-munaligned-doubles</b>,  GCC assumes that doubles have 8-byte alignment only if they are contained
           in another type, or if they have an  absolute  address.   Otherwise,  it  assumes  they  have  4-byte
           alignment.   Specifying  this  option  avoids some rare compatibility problems with code generated by
           other compilers.  It is not the default because it results in  a  performance  loss,  especially  for
           floating-point code.

       <b>-muser-mode</b>
       <b>-mno-user-mode</b>
           Do  not  generate  code  that  can only run in supervisor mode.  This is relevant only for the "casa"
           instruction emitted for the LEON3 processor.  This is the default.

       <b>-mfaster-structs</b>
       <b>-mno-faster-structs</b>
           With <b>-mfaster-structs</b>, the compiler assumes that  structures  should  have  8-byte  alignment.   This
           enables the use of pairs of "ldd" and "std" instructions for copies in structure assignment, in place
           of  twice  as many "ld" and "st" pairs.  However, the use of this changed alignment directly violates
           the SPARC ABI.  Thus, it's intended only for use on targets where  the  developer  acknowledges  that
           their resulting code is not directly in line with the rules of the ABI.

       <b>-mstd-struct-return</b>
       <b>-mno-std-struct-return</b>
           With  <b>-mstd-struct-return</b>,  the compiler generates checking code in functions returning structures or
           unions to detect size mismatches between the two sides of function calls, as per the 32-bit ABI.

           The default is <b>-mno-std-struct-return</b>.  This option has no effect in 64-bit mode.

       <b>-mlra</b>
       <b>-mno-lra</b>
           Enable Local Register Allocation.  This is the default for SPARC since GCC 7 so <b>-mno-lra</b> needs to  be
           passed to get old Reload.

       <b>-mcpu=</b><u>cpu_type</u>
           Set  the  instruction  set,  register  set,  and  instruction  scheduling parameters for machine type
           <u>cpu_type</u>.  Supported values for <u>cpu_type</u> are <b>v7</b>, <b>cypress</b>, <b>v8</b>, <b>supersparc</b>,  <b>hypersparc</b>,  <b>leon</b>,  <b>leon3</b>,
           <b>leon3v7</b>,  <b>leon5</b>,  <b>sparclite</b>, <b>f930</b>, <b>f934</b>, <b>sparclite86x</b>, <b>sparclet</b>, <b>tsc701</b>, <b>v9</b>, <b>ultrasparc</b>, <b>ultrasparc3</b>,
           <b>niagara</b>, <b>niagara2</b>, <b>niagara3</b>, <b>niagara4</b>, <b>niagara7</b> and <b>m8</b>.

           Native Solaris and GNU/Linux toolchains also  support  the  value  <b>native</b>,  which  selects  the  best
           architecture option for the host processor.  <b>-mcpu=native</b> has no effect if GCC does not recognize the
           processor.

           Default  instruction scheduling parameters are used for values that select an architecture and not an
           implementation.  These are <b>v7</b>, <b>v8</b>, <b>sparclite</b>, <b>sparclet</b>, <b>v9</b>.

           Here is a list of each supported architecture and their supported implementations.

           v7  cypress, leon3v7

           v8  supersparc, hypersparc, leon, leon3, leon5

           sparclite
               f930, f934, sparclite86x

           sparclet
               tsc701

           v9  ultrasparc, ultrasparc3, niagara, niagara2, niagara3, niagara4, niagara7, m8

           By default (unless configured otherwise), GCC  generates  code  for  the  V7  variant  of  the  SPARC
           architecture.   With  <b>-mcpu=cypress</b>,  the  compiler additionally optimizes it for the Cypress CY7C602
           chip, as used in the SPARCStation/SPARCServer 3xx series.  This is also  appropriate  for  the  older
           SPARCStation 1, 2, IPX etc.

           With  <b>-mcpu=v8</b>, GCC generates code for the V8 variant of the SPARC architecture.  The only difference
           from V7 code is that the compiler emits the integer multiply and integer  divide  instructions  which
           exist in SPARC-V8 but not in SPARC-V7.  With <b>-mcpu=supersparc</b>, the compiler additionally optimizes it
           for the SuperSPARC chip, as used in the SPARCStation 10, 1000 and 2000 series.

           With  <b>-mcpu=sparclite</b>,  GCC generates code for the SPARClite variant of the SPARC architecture.  This
           adds the integer multiply, integer divide step and scan ("ffs") instructions which exist in SPARClite
           but not in SPARC-V7.  With <b>-mcpu=f930</b>, the compiler additionally optimizes it for the Fujitsu MB86930
           chip, which is the original SPARClite, with no  FPU.   With  <b>-mcpu=f934</b>,  the  compiler  additionally
           optimizes it for the Fujitsu MB86934 chip, which is the more recent SPARClite with FPU.

           With  <b>-mcpu=sparclet</b>,  GCC  generates  code for the SPARClet variant of the SPARC architecture.  This
           adds the integer multiply, multiply/accumulate, integer divide step  and  scan  ("ffs")  instructions
           which  exist in SPARClet but not in SPARC-V7.  With <b>-mcpu=tsc701</b>, the compiler additionally optimizes
           it for the TEMIC SPARClet chip.

           With <b>-mcpu=v9</b>, GCC generates code for the V9 variant of the SPARC  architecture.   This  adds  64-bit
           integer  and  floating-point  move instructions, 3 additional floating-point condition code registers
           and conditional move instructions.  With <b>-mcpu=ultrasparc</b>, the compiler additionally optimizes it for
           the Sun UltraSPARC I/II/IIi chips.  With <b>-mcpu=ultrasparc3</b>, the compiler  additionally  optimizes  it
           for   the   Sun  UltraSPARC  III/III+/IIIi/IIIi+/IV/IV+  chips.   With  <b>-mcpu=niagara</b>,  the  compiler
           additionally  optimizes  it  for  Sun  UltraSPARC  T1  chips.   With  <b>-mcpu=niagara2</b>,  the   compiler
           additionally optimizes it for Sun UltraSPARC T2 chips. With <b>-mcpu=niagara3</b>, the compiler additionally
           optimizes  it  for Sun UltraSPARC T3 chips.  With <b>-mcpu=niagara4</b>, the compiler additionally optimizes
           it for Sun UltraSPARC T4 chips.  With <b>-mcpu=niagara7</b>, the  compiler  additionally  optimizes  it  for
           Oracle SPARC M7 chips.  With <b>-mcpu=m8</b>, the compiler additionally optimizes it for Oracle M8 chips.

       <b>-mtune=</b><u>cpu_type</u>
           Set  the  instruction scheduling parameters for machine type <u>cpu_type</u>, but do not set the instruction
           set or register set that the option <b>-mcpu=</b><u>cpu_type</u> does.

           The same values for <b>-mcpu=</b><u>cpu_type</u> can be used for <b>-mtune=</b><u>cpu_type</u>, but the only  useful  values  are
           those  that select a particular CPU implementation.  Those are <b>cypress</b>, <b>supersparc</b>, <b>hypersparc</b>, <b>leon</b>,
           <b>leon3</b>, <b>leon3v7</b>, <b>leon5</b>, <b>f930</b>, <b>f934</b>, <b>sparclite86x</b>, <b>tsc701</b>, <b>ultrasparc</b>, <b>ultrasparc3</b>, <b>niagara</b>,  <b>niagara2</b>,
           <b>niagara3</b>,  <b>niagara4</b>,  <b>niagara7</b> and <b>m8</b>.  With native Solaris and GNU/Linux toolchains, <b>native</b> can also
           be used.

       <b>-mv8plus</b>
       <b>-mno-v8plus</b>
           With <b>-mv8plus</b>, GCC generates code for the SPARC-V8+ ABI.  The difference from the V8 ABI is that  the
           global  and  out  registers  are  considered  64 bits wide.  This is enabled by default on Solaris in
           32-bit mode for all SPARC-V9 processors.

       <b>-mvis</b>
       <b>-mno-vis</b>
           With <b>-mvis</b>, GCC generates code  that  takes  advantage  of  the  UltraSPARC  Visual  Instruction  Set
           extensions.  The default is <b>-mno-vis</b>.

       <b>-mvis2</b>
       <b>-mno-vis2</b>
           With  <b>-mvis2</b>,  GCC  generates  code  that  takes  advantage  of  version 2.0 of the UltraSPARC Visual
           Instruction Set extensions.   The  default  is  <b>-mvis2</b>  when  targeting  a  cpu  that  supports  such
           instructions, such as UltraSPARC-III and later.  Setting <b>-mvis2</b> also sets <b>-mvis</b>.

       <b>-mvis3</b>
       <b>-mno-vis3</b>
           With  <b>-mvis3</b>,  GCC  generates  code  that  takes  advantage  of  version 3.0 of the UltraSPARC Visual
           Instruction Set extensions.   The  default  is  <b>-mvis3</b>  when  targeting  a  cpu  that  supports  such
           instructions, such as niagara-3 and later.  Setting <b>-mvis3</b> also sets <b>-mvis2</b> and <b>-mvis</b>.

       <b>-mvis4</b>
       <b>-mno-vis4</b>
           With  <b>-mvis4</b>,  GCC  generates  code  that  takes  advantage  of  version 4.0 of the UltraSPARC Visual
           Instruction Set extensions.   The  default  is  <b>-mvis4</b>  when  targeting  a  cpu  that  supports  such
           instructions, such as niagara-7 and later.  Setting <b>-mvis4</b> also sets <b>-mvis3</b>, <b>-mvis2</b> and <b>-mvis</b>.

       <b>-mvis4b</b>
       <b>-mno-vis4b</b>
           With  <b>-mvis4b</b>,  GCC  generates  code  that  takes  advantage  of version 4.0 of the UltraSPARC Visual
           Instruction Set extensions, plus the additional VIS  instructions  introduced  in  the  Oracle  SPARC
           Architecture 2017.  The default is <b>-mvis4b</b> when targeting a cpu that supports such instructions, such
           as m8 and later.  Setting <b>-mvis4b</b> also sets <b>-mvis4</b>, <b>-mvis3</b>, <b>-mvis2</b> and <b>-mvis</b>.

       <b>-mcbcond</b>
       <b>-mno-cbcond</b>
           With  <b>-mcbcond</b>,  GCC  generates  code  that  takes advantage of the UltraSPARC Compare-and-Branch-on-
           Condition  instructions.   The  default  is  <b>-mcbcond</b>  when  targeting  a  CPU  that  supports   such
           instructions, such as Niagara-4 and later.

       <b>-mfmaf</b>
       <b>-mno-fmaf</b>
           With  <b>-mfmaf</b>,  GCC generates code that takes advantage of the UltraSPARC Fused Multiply-Add Floating-
           point instructions.  The default is <b>-mfmaf</b> when targeting a CPU that supports such instructions, such
           as Niagara-3 and later.

       <b>-mfsmuld</b>
       <b>-mno-fsmuld</b>
           With <b>-mfsmuld</b>, GCC generates code that takes advantage  of  the  Floating-point  Multiply  Single  to
           Double  (FsMULd)  instruction.   The  default  is  <b>-mfsmuld</b>  when  targeting  a  CPU  supporting  the
           architecture versions V8 or V9 with FPU except <b>-mcpu=leon</b>.

       <b>-mpopc</b>
       <b>-mno-popc</b>
           With <b>-mpopc</b>, GCC generates code that takes advantage of the UltraSPARC Population Count  instruction.
           The  default  is <b>-mpopc</b> when targeting a CPU that supports such an instruction, such as Niagara-2 and
           later.

       <b>-msubxc</b>
       <b>-mno-subxc</b>
           With <b>-msubxc</b>, GCC generates code that takes advantage of the UltraSPARC  Subtract-Extended-with-Carry
           instruction.   The default is <b>-msubxc</b> when targeting a CPU that supports such an instruction, such as
           Niagara-7 and later.

       <b>-mfix-at697f</b>
           Enable the documented workaround for  the  single  erratum  of  the  Atmel  AT697F  processor  (which
           corresponds to erratum #13 of the AT697E processor).

       <b>-mfix-ut699</b>
           Enable  the documented workarounds for the floating-point errata and the data cache nullify errata of
           the UT699 processor.

       <b>-mfix-ut700</b>
           Enable the documented workaround for the back-to-back store errata of the UT699E/UT700 processor.

       <b>-mfix-gr712rc</b>
           Enable the documented workaround for the back-to-back store errata of the GR712RC processor.

       These <b>-m</b> options are supported in addition to the above on SPARC-V9 processors in 64-bit environments:

       <b>-m32</b>
       <b>-m64</b>
           Generate code for a 32-bit or 64-bit environment.  The 32-bit environment sets int, long and  pointer
           to 32 bits.  The 64-bit environment sets int to 32 bits and long and pointer to 64 bits.

       <b>-mcmodel=</b><u>which</u>
           Set the code model to one of

           <b>medlow</b>
               The  Medium/Low  code  model:  64-bit  addresses,  programs  must be linked in the low 32 bits of
               memory.  Programs can be statically or dynamically linked.

           <b>medmid</b>
               The Medium/Middle code model: 64-bit addresses, programs must be linked in the  low  44  bits  of
               memory,  the  text  and  data segments must be less than 2GB in size and the data segment must be
               located within 2GB of the text segment.

           <b>medany</b>
               The Medium/Anywhere code model: 64-bit addresses, programs may be linked anywhere in memory,  the
               text  and data segments must be less than 2GB in size and the data segment must be located within
               2GB of the text segment.

           <b>embmedany</b>
               The Medium/Anywhere code model for embedded systems: 64-bit addresses, the text and data segments
               must be less than 2GB in size, both starting anywhere in memory (determined at link  time).   The
               global  register  %g4 points to the base of the data segment.  Programs are statically linked and
               PIC is not supported.

       <b>-mmemory-model=</b><u>mem-model</u>
           Set the memory model in force on the processor to one of

           <b>default</b>
               The default memory model for the processor and operating system.

           <b>rmo</b> Relaxed Memory Order

           <b>pso</b> Partial Store Order

           <b>tso</b> Total Store Order

           <b>sc</b>  Sequential Consistency

           These memory models are formally defined in Appendix D of the SPARC-V9 architecture manual, as set in
           the processor's "PSTATE.MM" field.

       <b>-mstack-bias</b>
       <b>-mno-stack-bias</b>
           With <b>-mstack-bias</b>, GCC assumes that the stack pointer, and frame pointer if present,  are  offset  by
           -2047  which  must  be  added back when making stack frame references.  This is the default in 64-bit
           mode.  Otherwise, assume no such offset is present.

       <u>Options</u> <u>for</u> <u>System</u> <u>V</u>

       These additional options are available on System V Release 4 for compatibility with  other  compilers  on
       those systems:

       <b>-G</b>  Create a shared object.  It is recommended that <b>-symbolic</b> or <b>-shared</b> be used instead.

       <b>-Qy</b> Identify  the  versions  of  each tool used by the compiler, in a ".ident" assembler directive in the
           output.

       <b>-Qn</b> Refrain from adding ".ident" directives to the output file (this is the default).

       <b>-YP,</b><u>dirs</u>
           Search the directories <u>dirs</u>, and no others, for libraries specified with <b>-l</b>.

       <b>-Ym,</b><u>dir</u>
           Look in the directory <u>dir</u> to find the M4 preprocessor.  The assembler uses this option.

       <u>TILE-Gx</u> <u>Options</u>

       These <b>-m</b> options are supported on the TILE-Gx:

       <b>-mcmodel=small</b>
           Generate code for the small model.  The distance for direct  calls  is  limited  to  500M  in  either
           direction.  PC-relative addresses are 32 bits.  Absolute addresses support the full address range.

       <b>-mcmodel=large</b>
           Generate  code  for the large model.  There is no limitation on call distance, pc-relative addresses,
           or absolute addresses.

       <b>-mcpu=</b><u>name</u>
           Selects the type of CPU to be targeted.  Currently the only supported type is <b>tilegx</b>.

       <b>-m32</b>
       <b>-m64</b>
           Generate code for a 32-bit or 64-bit environment.  The 32-bit environment sets int, long, and pointer
           to 32 bits.  The 64-bit environment sets int to 32 bits and long and pointer to 64 bits.

       <b>-mbig-endian</b>
       <b>-mlittle-endian</b>
           Generate code in big/little endian mode, respectively.

       <u>TILEPro</u> <u>Options</u>

       These <b>-m</b> options are supported on the TILEPro:

       <b>-mcpu=</b><u>name</u>
           Selects the type of CPU to be targeted.  Currently the only supported type is <b>tilepro</b>.

       <b>-m32</b>
           Generate code for a 32-bit environment, which sets int, long, and pointer to 32 bits.   This  is  the
           only supported behavior so the flag is essentially ignored.

       <u>V850</u> <u>Options</u>

       These <b>-m</b> options are defined for V850 implementations:

       <b>-mlong-calls</b>
       <b>-mno-long-calls</b>
           Treat  all  calls as being far away (near).  If calls are assumed to be far away, the compiler always
           loads the function's address into a register, and calls indirect through the pointer.

       <b>-mno-ep</b>
       <b>-mep</b>
           Do not optimize (do optimize) basic blocks that use the same index pointer 4 or more  times  to  copy
           pointer into the "ep" register, and use the shorter "sld" and "sst" instructions.  The <b>-mep</b> option is
           on by default if you optimize.

       <b>-mno-prolog-function</b>
       <b>-mprolog-function</b>
           Do  not use (do use) external functions to save and restore registers at the prologue and epilogue of
           a function.  The external functions are slower, but use less code space if  more  than  one  function
           saves the same number of registers.  The <b>-mprolog-function</b> option is on by default if you optimize.

       <b>-mspace</b>
           Try  to  make  the  code  as  small  as  possible.   At  present,  this  just  turns  on the <b>-mep</b> and
           <b>-mprolog-function</b> options.

       <b>-mtda=</b><u>n</u>
           Put static or global variables whose size is <u>n</u> bytes or less into the tiny data  area  that  register
           "ep"  points  to.   The  tiny  data  area  can  hold  up  to  256  bytes in total (128 bytes for byte
           references).

       <b>-msda=</b><u>n</u>
           Put static or global variables whose size is <u>n</u> bytes or less into the small data area  that  register

       <b>-mv850</b>
           Specify that the target processor is the V850.

       <b>-mv850e3v5</b>
           Specify  that  the  target  processor  is  the V850E3V5.  The preprocessor constant "__v850e3v5__" is
           defined if this option is used.

       <b>-mv850e2v4</b>

           defined if this option is used.

       <b>-mv850e2</b>
           Specify  that  the target processor is the V850E2.  The preprocessor constant "__v850e2__" is defined
           if this option is used.

       <b>-mv850e1</b>
           Specify that the target processor  is  the  V850E1.   The  preprocessor  constants  "__v850e1__"  and

       <b>-mv850es</b>
           Specify that the target processor is the V850ES.  This is an alias for the <b>-mv850e1</b> option.

       <b>-mv850e</b>
           Specify  that the target processor is the V850E.  The preprocessor constant "__v850e__" is defined if

           If neither <b>-mv850</b> nor <b>-mv850e</b> nor <b>-mv850e1</b> nor <b>-mv850e2</b> nor <b>-mv850e2v3</b>  nor  <b>-mv850e3v5</b>  are  defined
           then  a  default  target  processor  is  chosen  and  the relevant <b>__v850*__</b> preprocessor constant is
           defined.

           The preprocessor constants "__v850" and "__v851__" are always defined, regardless of which  processor
           variant is the target.

       <b>-mdisable-callt</b>
       <b>-mno-disable-callt</b>
           This  option suppresses generation of the "CALLT" instruction for the v850e, v850e1, v850e2, v850e2v3
           and v850e3v5 flavors of the v850 architecture.

           This option is enabled by default when the RH850 ABI is in use (see  <b>-mrh850-abi</b>),  and  disabled  by
           default  when  the  GCC  ABI  is  in  use.   If  "CALLT"  instructions are being generated then the C
           preprocessor symbol "__V850_CALLT__" is defined.

       <b>-mrelax</b>
       <b>-mno-relax</b>
           Pass on (or do not pass on) the <b>-mrelax</b> command-line option to the assembler.

       <b>-mlong-jumps</b>
       <b>-mno-long-jumps</b>
           Disable (or re-enable) the generation of PC-relative jump instructions.

       <b>-msoft-float</b>
       <b>-mhard-float</b>
           Disable (or re-enable) the generation of hardware floating point instructions.  This option  is  only
           significant  when  the  target  architecture  is  <b>V850E2V3</b>  or  higher.   If  hardware floating point
           instructions are being generated then the C preprocessor symbol "__FPU_OK__"  is  defined,  otherwise
           the symbol "__NO_FPU__" is defined.

       <b>-mloop</b>
           Enables  the use of the e3v5 LOOP instruction.  The use of this instruction is not enabled by default
           when the e3v5 architecture is selected because its use is still experimental.

       <b>-mrh850-abi</b>
       <b>-mghs</b>
           Enables support for the RH850 version of the V850 ABI.  This is the default.  With  this  version  of
           the ABI the following rules apply:

           *   Integer sized structures and unions are returned via a memory pointer rather than a register.

           *   Large structures and unions (more than 8 bytes in size) are passed by value.

           *   Functions are aligned to 16-bit boundaries.

           *   The <b>-m8byte-align</b> command-line option is supported.

           *   The  <b>-mdisable-callt</b>  command-line option is enabled by default.  The <b>-mno-disable-callt</b> command-
               line option is not supported.

           When this version of the ABI is enabled the C preprocessor symbol "__V850_RH850_ABI__" is defined.

       <b>-mgcc-abi</b>
           Enables support for the old GCC version of the V850 ABI.  With this version of the ABI the  following
           rules apply:

           *   Integer sized structures and unions are returned in register "r10".

           *   Large structures and unions (more than 8 bytes in size) are passed by reference.

           *   Functions are aligned to 32-bit boundaries, unless optimizing for size.

           *   The <b>-m8byte-align</b> command-line option is not supported.

           *   The <b>-mdisable-callt</b> command-line option is supported but not enabled by default.

           When this version of the ABI is enabled the C preprocessor symbol "__V850_GCC_ABI__" is defined.

       <b>-m8byte-align</b>
       <b>-mno-8byte-align</b>
           Enables  support  for "double" and "long long" types to be aligned on 8-byte boundaries.  The default
           is to restrict the alignment of all objects to at most 4-bytes.  When <b>-m8byte-align</b> is in effect  the
           C preprocessor symbol "__V850_8BYTE_ALIGN__" is defined.

       <b>-mbig-switch</b>
           Generate  code suitable for big switch tables.  Use this option only if the assembler/linker complain
           about out of range branches within a switch table.

       <b>-mapp-regs</b>
           This option causes r2 and r5 to be used in the code generated by the compiler.  This setting  is  the
           default.

       <b>-mno-app-regs</b>
           This option causes r2 and r5 to be treated as fixed registers.

       <u>VAX</u> <u>Options</u>

       These <b>-m</b> options are defined for the VAX:

       <b>-munix</b>
           Do  not  output  certain  jump  instructions ("aobleq" and so on) that the Unix assembler for the VAX
           cannot handle across long ranges.

       <b>-mgnu</b>
           Do output those jump instructions, on the assumption that the GNU assembler is being used.

       <b>-mg</b> Output code for G-format floating-point numbers instead of D-format.

       <u>Visium</u> <u>Options</u>

       <b>-mdebug</b>
           A program which performs file I/O and is destined to run on an MCM target should be linked with  this
           option.   It  causes  the libraries libc.a and libdebug.a to be linked.  The program should be run on
           the target under the control of the GDB remote debugging stub.

       <b>-msim</b>
           A program which performs file I/O and is destined to run on  the  simulator  should  be  linked  with
           option.  This causes libraries libc.a and libsim.a to be linked.

       <b>-mfpu</b>
       <b>-mhard-float</b>
           Generate code containing floating-point instructions.  This is the default.

       <b>-mno-fpu</b>
       <b>-msoft-float</b>
           Generate code containing library calls for floating-point.

           <b>-msoft-float</b>  changes  the calling convention in the output file; therefore, it is only useful if you
           compile <u>all</u> of a program with this option.  In particular, you need to compile <u>libgcc.a</u>, the  library
           that comes with GCC, with <b>-msoft-float</b> in order for this to work.

       <b>-mcpu=</b><u>cpu_type</u>
           Set  the  instruction  set,  register  set,  and  instruction  scheduling parameters for machine type
           <u>cpu_type</u>.  Supported values for <u>cpu_type</u> are <b>mcm</b>, <b>gr5</b> and <b>gr6</b>.

           <b>mcm</b> is a synonym of <b>gr5</b> present for backward compatibility.

           By default (unless configured otherwise), GCC generates code  for  the  GR5  variant  of  the  Visium
           architecture.

           With  <b>-mcpu=gr6</b>,  GCC  generates  code  for  the  GR6  variant  of the Visium architecture.  The only
           difference from GR5 code is that the compiler will generate block move instructions.

       <b>-mtune=</b><u>cpu_type</u>
           Set the instruction scheduling parameters for machine type <u>cpu_type</u>, but do not set  the  instruction
           set or register set that the option <b>-mcpu=</b><u>cpu_type</u> would.

       <b>-msv-mode</b>
           Generate  code  for  the  supervisor  mode,  where there are no restrictions on the access to general
           registers.  This is the default.

       <b>-muser-mode</b>
           Generate code for the user mode, where the access to some general registers is forbidden: on the GR5,
           registers r24 to r31 cannot be accessed in this mode; on the GR6,  only  registers  r29  to  r31  are
           affected.

       <u>VMS</u> <u>Options</u>

       These <b>-m</b> options are defined for the VMS implementations:

       <b>-mvms-return-codes</b>
           Return  VMS  condition codes from "main". The default is to return POSIX-style condition (e.g. error)
           codes.

       <b>-mdebug-main=</b><u>prefix</u>
           Flag the first routine whose name starts with <u>prefix</u> as the main routine for the debugger.

       <b>-mmalloc64</b>
           Default to 64-bit memory allocation routines.

       <b>-mpointer-size=</b><u>size</u>
           Set the default size of pointers. Possible options for <u>size</u> are <b>32</b> or <b>short</b> for 32 bit  pointers,  <b>64</b>
           or  <b>long</b>  for 64 bit pointers, and <b>no</b> for supporting only 32 bit pointers.  The later option disables
           "pragma pointer_size".

       <u>VxWorks</u> <u>Options</u>

       The options in this section are defined for all VxWorks targets.  Options specific to the target hardware
       are listed with the other options for that target.

       <b>-mrtp</b>
           GCC can generate code for both VxWorks kernels and real time processes (RTPs).  This option  switches
           from the former to the latter.  It also defines the preprocessor macro "__RTP__".

       <b>-non-static</b>
           Link  an  RTP  executable against shared libraries rather than static libraries.  The options <b>-static</b>
           and <b>-shared</b> can also be used for RTPs; <b>-static</b> is the default.

       <b>-Bstatic</b>
       <b>-Bdynamic</b>
           These options are passed down to the linker.  They are defined for compatibility with Diab.

       <b>-Xbind-lazy</b>
           Enable lazy binding of function calls.  This option is equivalent to <b>-Wl,-z,now</b> and  is  defined  for
           compatibility with Diab.

       <b>-Xbind-now</b>
           Disable  lazy binding of function calls.  This option is the default and is defined for compatibility
           with Diab.

       <u>x86</u> <u>Options</u>

       These <b>-m</b> options are defined for the x86 family of computers.

       <b>-march=</b><u>cpu-type</u>
           Generate instructions for the machine type <u>cpu-type</u>.  In contrast to  <b>-mtune=</b><u>cpu-type</u>,  which  merely
           tunes the generated code for the specified <u>cpu-type</u>, <b>-march=</b><u>cpu-type</u> allows GCC to generate code that
           may  not  run  at all on processors other than the one indicated.  Specifying <b>-march=</b><u>cpu-type</u> implies
           <b>-mtune=</b><u>cpu-type</u>, except where noted otherwise.

           The choices for <u>cpu-type</u> are:

           <b>native</b>
               This selects the CPU to generate code for at compilation time by determining the  processor  type
               of  the  compiling machine.  Using <b>-march=native</b> enables all instruction subsets supported by the
               local machine (hence the result might  not  run  on  different  machines).   Using  <b>-mtune=native</b>
               produces  code  optimized for the local machine under the constraints of the selected instruction
               set.

           <b>x86-64</b>
               A generic CPU with 64-bit extensions.

           <b>x86-64-v2</b>
           <b>x86-64-v3</b>
           <b>x86-64-v4</b>
               These choices for <u>cpu-type</u> select the corresponding  micro-architecture  level  from  the  x86-64
               psABI.  On ABIs other than the x86-64 psABI they select the same CPU features as the x86-64 psABI
               documents for the particular micro-architecture level.

               Since  these  <u>cpu-type</u> values do not have a corresponding <b>-mtune</b> setting, using <b>-march</b> with these
               values enables generic tuning.  Specific tuning can be enabled  using  the  <b>-mtune=</b><u>other-cpu-type</u>
               option with an appropriate <u>other-cpu-type</u> value.

           <b>i686</b>
               When  used  with  <b>-march</b>,  the  Pentium Pro instruction set is used, so the code runs on all i686
               family chips.  When used with <b>-mtune</b>, it has the same meaning as <b>generic</b>.

       <b>-mtune=</b><u>cpu-type</u>
           Tune  to  <u>cpu-type</u>  everything applicable about the generated code, except for the ABI and the set of
           available instructions.  While picking a specific <u>cpu-type</u> schedules things  appropriately  for  that
           particular  chip, the compiler does not generate any code that cannot run on the default machine type
           unless you use a <b>-march=</b><u>cpu-type</u> option.  For example, if GCC  is  configured  for  i686-pc-linux-gnu
           then <b>-mtune=pentium4</b> generates code that is tuned for Pentium 4 but still runs on i686 machines.

           The  choices  for  <u>cpu-type</u> are the same as for <b>-march</b>.  In addition, <b>-mtune</b> supports 2 extra choices
           for <u>cpu-type</u>:

           <b>generic</b>
               Produce code optimized for the most common IA32/AMD64/EM64T processors.  If you know the  CPU  on
               which  your  code will run, then you should use the corresponding <b>-mtune</b> or <b>-march</b> option instead
               of <b>-mtune=generic</b>.  But, if you do not know exactly what CPU users of your application will have,
               then you should use this option.

               As new processors are deployed in the marketplace, the  behavior  of  this  option  will  change.
               Therefore,  if  you  upgrade to a newer version of GCC, code generation controlled by this option
               will change to reflect the processors that are most common at the time that  version  of  GCC  is
               released.

               There  is  no <b>-march=generic</b> option because <b>-march</b> indicates the instruction set the compiler can
               use, and there is no generic instruction set applicable to all processors.  In  contrast,  <b>-mtune</b>
               indicates  the  processor  (or,  in  this  case,  collection of processors) for which the code is
               optimized.

           <b>intel</b>
               Produce code optimized for the most current Intel processors, which are  Haswell  and  Silvermont
               for  this  version  of GCC.  If you know the CPU on which your code will run, then you should use
               the corresponding <b>-mtune</b> or <b>-march</b> option  instead  of  <b>-mtune=intel</b>.   But,  if  you  want  your
               application performs better on both Haswell and Silvermont, then you should use this option.

               As new Intel processors are deployed in the marketplace, the behavior of this option will change.
               Therefore,  if  you  upgrade to a newer version of GCC, code generation controlled by this option
               will change to reflect the most current Intel processors at the  time  that  version  of  GCC  is
               released.

               There  is  no  <b>-march=intel</b>  option because <b>-march</b> indicates the instruction set the compiler can
               use, and there is no common instruction set applicable to all processors.   In  contrast,  <b>-mtune</b>
               indicates  the  processor  (or,  in  this  case,  collection of processors) for which the code is
               optimized.

       <b>-mcpu=</b><u>cpu-type</u>
           A deprecated synonym for <b>-mtune</b>.

       <b>-mfpmath=</b><u>unit</u>
           Generate floating-point arithmetic for selected unit <u>unit</u>.  The choices for <u>unit</u> are:

           <b>387</b> Use the standard 387 floating-point coprocessor present on the majority  of  chips  and  emulated
               otherwise.   Code  compiled  with  this option runs almost everywhere.  The temporary results are
               computed in 80-bit precision instead of  the  precision  specified  by  the  type,  resulting  in
               slightly  different results compared to most of other chips.  See <b>-ffloat-store</b> for more detailed
               description.

               This is the default choice for non-Darwin x86-32 targets.

           <b>sse</b> Use scalar floating-point instructions present in the SSE instruction set.  This instruction  set
               is  supported  by  Pentium  III  and  newer chips, and in the AMD line by Athlon-4, Athlon XP and
               Athlon MP chips.  The earlier version of the SSE instruction set supports  only  single-precision
               arithmetic,  thus the double and extended-precision arithmetic are still done using 387.  A later
               version, present only in Pentium 4 and AMD x86-64  chips,  supports  double-precision  arithmetic
               too.

               For  the  x86-32  compiler,  you must use <b>-march=</b><u>cpu-type</u>, <b>-msse</b> or <b>-msse2</b> switches to enable SSE
               extensions and make this option effective.  For the x86-64 compiler, these extensions are enabled
               by default.

               The resulting code should be considerably faster in the majority of cases and avoid the numerical
               instability problems of 387 code, but may break some existing code that expects temporaries to be
               80 bits.

               This is the default choice for the x86-64 compiler, Darwin x86-32 targets, and the default choice
               for x86-32 targets with the SSE2 instruction set when <b>-ffast-math</b> is enabled.

           <b>sse,387</b>
           <b>sse+387</b>
           <b>both</b>
               Attempt to utilize both instruction sets  at  once.   This  effectively  doubles  the  amount  of
               available  registers,  and  on  chips with separate execution units for 387 and SSE the execution
               resources too.  Use this option with care, as it is still experimental, because the GCC  register
               allocator does not model separate functional units well, resulting in unstable performance.

       <b>-masm=</b><u>dialect</u>
           Output  assembly  instructions  using selected <u>dialect</u>.  Also affects which dialect is used for basic
           "asm" and extended "asm". Supported choices (in dialect order) are <b>att</b> or <b>intel</b>. The default is  <b>att</b>.
           Darwin does not support <b>intel</b>.

       <b>-mieee-fp</b>
       <b>-mno-ieee-fp</b>
           Control whether or not the compiler uses IEEE floating-point comparisons.  These correctly handle the
           case where the result of a comparison is unordered.

       <b>-m80387</b>
       <b>-mhard-float</b>
           Generate output containing 80387 instructions for floating point.

       <b>-mno-80387</b>
       <b>-msoft-float</b>
           Generate output containing library calls for floating point.

           <b>Warning:</b> the requisite libraries are not part of GCC.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual
           C  compiler  are used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make your own
           arrangements to provide suitable library functions for cross-compilation.

           On machines where a function returns  floating-point  results  in  the  80387  register  stack,  some
           floating-point opcodes may be emitted even if <b>-msoft-float</b> is used.

       <b>-mno-fp-ret-in-387</b>
           Do not use the FPU registers for return values of functions.

           The  usual  calling  convention  has  functions return values of types "float" and "double" in an FPU
           register, even if there is no FPU.  The idea is that the operating system should emulate an FPU.

           The option <b>-mno-fp-ret-in-387</b> causes such values to be returned in ordinary CPU registers instead.

       <b>-mno-fancy-math-387</b>
           Some 387 emulators do not support the "sin", "cos" and "sqrt" instructions for the 387.  Specify this
           option to avoid generating those instructions.  This option is overridden when <b>-march</b> indicates  that
           the  target CPU always has an FPU and so the instruction does not need emulation.  These instructions
           are not generated unless you also use the <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations</b> switch.

       <b>-malign-double</b>
       <b>-mno-align-double</b>
           Control whether GCC aligns "double", "long double", and "long long" variables on a two-word  boundary
           or  a  one-word boundary.  Aligning "double" variables on a two-word boundary produces code that runs
           somewhat faster on a Pentium at the expense of more memory.

           On x86-64, <b>-malign-double</b> is enabled by default.

           <b>Warning:</b> if you use the <b>-malign-double</b> switch, structures containing  the  above  types  are  aligned
           differently than the published application binary interface specifications for the x86-32 and are not
           binary compatible with structures in code compiled without that switch.

       <b>-m96bit-long-double</b>
       <b>-m128bit-long-double</b>
           These  switches  control  the  size  of  "long double" type.  The x86-32 application binary interface
           specifies the size to be 96 bits, so <b>-m96bit-long-double</b> is the default in 32-bit mode.

           Modern architectures (Pentium and newer) prefer "long double" to be  aligned  to  an  8-  or  16-byte
           boundary.   In  arrays  or  structures  conforming  to  the ABI, this is not possible.  So specifying
           <b>-m128bit-long-double</b> aligns "long double" to a 16-byte boundary by padding the "long double" with  an
           additional 32-bit zero.

           In  the  x86-64  compiler, <b>-m128bit-long-double</b> is the default choice as its ABI specifies that "long
           double" is aligned on 16-byte boundary.

           Notice that neither of these options enable any extra precision over the x87 standard of 80 bits  for
           a "long double".

           <b>Warning:</b>  if  you override the default value for your target ABI, this changes the size of structures
           and arrays containing "long double" variables, as well as modifying the function  calling  convention
           for  functions taking "long double".  Hence they are not binary-compatible with code compiled without
           that switch.

       <b>-mlong-double-64</b>
       <b>-mlong-double-80</b>
       <b>-mlong-double-128</b>
           These switches control the size of "long double" type. A size of 64 bits makes the "long double" type
           equivalent to the "double" type. This is the default for 32-bit Bionic C library.  A size of 128 bits
           makes the "long double" type equivalent to the "__float128" type. This  is  the  default  for  64-bit
           Bionic C library.

           <b>Warning:</b>  if  you override the default value for your target ABI, this changes the size of structures
           and arrays containing "long double" variables, as well as modifying the function  calling  convention
           for  functions taking "long double".  Hence they are not binary-compatible with code compiled without
           that switch.

       <b>-malign-data=</b><u>type</u>
           Control how GCC aligns variables.  Supported values for <u>type</u>  are  <b>compat</b>  uses  increased  alignment
           value  compatible  uses  GCC 4.8 and earlier, <b>abi</b> uses alignment value as specified by the psABI, and
           <b>cacheline</b> uses increased alignment value to match the cache line size.  <b>compat</b> is the default.

       <b>-mlarge-data-threshold=</b><u>threshold</u>
           When <b>-mcmodel=medium</b> is specified, data objects larger than <u>threshold</u> are placed in  the  large  data
           section.   This  value  must  be  the same across all objects linked into the binary, and defaults to
           65535.

       <b>-mrtd</b>
           Use a different function-calling convention, in which functions that take a fixed number of arguments
           return with the "ret <u>num</u>" instruction, which pops their arguments while returning.   This  saves  one
           instruction in the caller since there is no need to pop the arguments there.

           You  can  specify  that an individual function is called with this calling sequence with the function
           attribute "stdcall".  You can also override the <b>-mrtd</b> option by using the function attribute "cdecl".

           <b>Warning:</b> this calling convention is incompatible with the one normally used on Unix,  so  you  cannot
           use it if you need to call libraries compiled with the Unix compiler.

           Also,  you must provide function prototypes for all functions that take variable numbers of arguments
           (including "printf"); otherwise incorrect code is generated for calls to those functions.

           In addition, seriously incorrect code results if  you  call  a  function  with  too  many  arguments.
           (Normally, extra arguments are harmlessly ignored.)

       <b>-mregparm=</b><u>num</u>
           Control  how many registers are used to pass integer arguments.  By default, no registers are used to
           pass arguments, and at most 3 registers can be used.  You can control this behavior  for  a  specific
           function by using the function attribute "regparm".

           <b>Warning:</b>  if  you  use this switch, and <u>num</u> is nonzero, then you must build all modules with the same
           value, including any libraries.  This includes the system libraries and startup modules.

       <b>-msseregparm</b>
           Use SSE register passing conventions for float and double  arguments  and  return  values.   You  can
           control this behavior for a specific function by using the function attribute "sseregparm".

           <b>Warning:</b>  if  you  use this switch then you must build all modules with the same value, including any
           libraries.  This includes the system libraries and startup modules.

       <b>-mvect8-ret-in-mem</b>
           Return 8-byte vectors in memory instead of MMX registers.  This is the default on  VxWorks  to  match
           the  ABI  of  the  Sun Studio compilers until version 12.  <u>Only</u> use this option if you need to remain
           compatible with existing code produced by those previous compiler versions or older versions of GCC.

       <b>-mpc32</b>
       <b>-mpc64</b>
       <b>-mpc80</b>
           Set 80387 floating-point precision to 32, 64 or 80 bits.  When <b>-mpc32</b> is specified, the  significands
           of  results of floating-point operations are rounded to 24 bits (single precision); <b>-mpc64</b> rounds the
           significands of results of floating-point operations to 53 bits (double precision) and <b>-mpc80</b>  rounds
           the  significands  of  results  of  floating-point operations to 64 bits (extended double precision),
           which is the default.  When this option is used, floating-point operations in higher  precisions  are
           not available to the programmer without setting the FPU control word explicitly.

           Setting  the  rounding  of  floating-point operations to less than the default 80 bits can speed some
           programs by 2% or more.   Note  that  some  mathematical  libraries  assume  that  extended-precision
           (80-bit)  floating-point  operations  are enabled by default; routines in such libraries could suffer
           significant loss of accuracy, typically through  so-called  "catastrophic  cancellation",  when  this
           option is used to set the precision to less than extended precision.

       <b>-mdaz-ftz</b>
           The  flush-to-zero (FTZ) and denormals-are-zero (DAZ) flags in the MXCSR register are used to control
           floating-point calculations.SSE and AVX instructions including scalar and vector  instructions  could
           benefit from enabling the FTZ and DAZ flags when <b>-mdaz-ftz</b> is specified. Don't set FTZ/DAZ flags when
           <b>-mno-daz-ftz</b> is specified.

       <b>-mstackrealign</b>
           Realign  the  stack  at entry.  On the x86, the <b>-mstackrealign</b> option generates an alternate prologue
           and epilogue that realigns the run-time stack if necessary.  This supports mixing legacy  codes  that
           keep   4-byte  stack  alignment  with  modern  codes  that  keep  16-byte  stack  alignment  for  SSE
           compatibility.  See also the attribute "force_align_arg_pointer", applicable to individual functions.

       <b>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=</b><u>num</u>
           Attempt  to  keep  the  stack  boundary  aligned  to  a  2  raised  to   <u>num</u>   byte   boundary.    If
           <b>-mpreferred-stack-boundary</b> is not specified, the default is 4 (16 bytes or 128 bits).

           <b>Warning:</b>   When   generating   code  for  the  x86-64  architecture  with  SSE  extensions  disabled,
           <b>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=3</b> can be used to keep the stack  boundary  aligned  to  8  byte  boundary.
           Since x86-64 ABI require 16 byte stack alignment, this is ABI incompatible and intended to be used in
           controlled  environment  where  stack space is important limitation.  This option leads to wrong code
           when functions compiled with 16 byte stack alignment (such as functions from a standard library)  are
           called  with  misaligned  stack.  In this case, SSE instructions may lead to misaligned memory access
           traps.  In addition,  variable  arguments  are  handled  incorrectly  for  16  byte  aligned  objects
           (including  x87 long double and __int128), leading to wrong results.  You must build all modules with
           <b>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=3</b>, including any  libraries.   This  includes  the  system  libraries  and
           startup modules.

       <b>-mincoming-stack-boundary=</b><u>num</u>
           Assume   the   incoming   stack   is   aligned   to   a   2   raised   to   <u>num</u>  byte  boundary.   If
           <b>-mincoming-stack-boundary</b> is not specified, the one specified by <b>-mpreferred-stack-boundary</b> is used.

           On Pentium and Pentium Pro, "double" and "long double" values should be aligned to an 8-byte boundary
           (see <b>-malign-double</b>) or suffer significant run time  performance  penalties.   On  Pentium  III,  the
           Streaming SIMD Extension (SSE) data type "__m128" may not work properly if it is not 16-byte aligned.

           To ensure proper alignment of this values on the stack, the stack boundary must be as aligned as that
           required  by  any  value stored on the stack.  Further, every function must be generated such that it
           keeps the stack aligned.  Thus calling a function compiled with a  higher  preferred  stack  boundary
           from  a  function compiled with a lower preferred stack boundary most likely misaligns the stack.  It
           is recommended that libraries that use callbacks always use the default setting.

           This extra alignment does consume extra stack space, and generally increases code size.  Code that is
           sensitive to stack space usage, such as embedded systems and operating system kernels,  may  want  to
           reduce the preferred alignment to <b>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2</b>.

           the functions enabled and disabled by these switches.

           To  generate  SSE/SSE2  instructions  automatically  from  floating-point  code  (as  opposed  to 387
           instructions), see <b>-mfpmath=sse</b>.

           GCC depresses SSEx instructions when <b>-mavx</b> is used. Instead, it generates new AVX instructions or AVX
           equivalence for all SSEx instructions when needed.

           These options enable GCC  to  use  these  extended  instructions  in  generated  code,  even  without
           <b>-mfpmath=sse</b>.   Applications that perform run-time CPU detection must compile separate files for each
           supported architecture, using the appropriate flags.  In particular,  the  file  containing  the  CPU
           detection code should be compiled without these options.

       <b>-mdump-tune-features</b>
           This  option  instructs  GCC  to  dump  the  names of the x86 performance tuning features and default
           settings. The names can be used in <b>-mtune-ctrl=</b><u>feature-list</u>.

       <b>-mtune-ctrl=</b><u>feature-list</u>
           This option is used to do fine grain control of x86 code  generation  features.   <u>feature-list</u>  is  a
           comma  separated list of <u>feature</u> names. See also <b>-mdump-tune-features</b>. When specified, the <u>feature</u> is
           turned on if it is not preceded with <b>^</b>, otherwise, it is  turned  off.   <b>-mtune-ctrl=</b><u>feature-list</u>  is
           intended to be used by GCC developers. Using it may lead to code paths not covered by testing and can
           potentially result in compiler ICEs or runtime errors.

       <b>-mno-default</b>
           This  option  instructs  GCC  to turn off all tunable features. See also <b>-mtune-ctrl=</b><u>feature-list</u> and
           <b>-mdump-tune-features</b>.

       <b>-mcld</b>
           This option instructs GCC to emit a "cld" instruction in the prologue of functions  that  use  string
           instructions.   String  instructions  depend  on  the  DF  flag  to  select  between autoincrement or
           autodecrement mode.  While the ABI specifies the DF flag  to  be  cleared  on  function  entry,  some
           operating  systems  violate  this  specification  by  not  clearing  the  DF  flag in their exception
           dispatchers.  The exception handler can be invoked with  the  DF  flag  set,  which  leads  to  wrong
           direction  mode  when  string instructions are used.  This option can be enabled by default on 32-bit
           x86 targets by  configuring  GCC  with  the  <b>--enable-cld</b>  configure  option.   Generation  of  "cld"
           instructions can be suppressed with the <b>-mno-cld</b> compiler option in this case.

       <b>-mvzeroupper</b>
           This option instructs GCC to emit a "vzeroupper" instruction before a transfer of control flow out of
           the  function to minimize the AVX to SSE transition penalty as well as remove unnecessary "zeroupper"
           intrinsics.

       <b>-mprefer-avx128</b>
           This option instructs GCC to use 128-bit AVX instructions instead of 256-bit AVX instructions in  the
           auto-vectorizer.

       <b>-mprefer-vector-width=</b><u>opt</u>
           This  option  instructs  GCC  to  use  <u>opt</u>-bit vector width in instructions instead of default on the
           selected platform.

           <b>none</b>
               No extra limitations applied to GCC other than defined by the selected platform.

           <b>128</b> Prefer 128-bit vector width for instructions.

           <b>256</b> Prefer 256-bit vector width for instructions.

           <b>512</b> Prefer 512-bit vector width for instructions.

       <b>-mcx16</b>
           This option enables GCC to generate "CMPXCHG16B" instructions in 64-bit code  to  implement  compare-
           and-exchange  operations  on  16-byte  aligned 128-bit objects.  This is useful for atomic updates of
           data structures exceeding one machine word in size.  The compiler uses this instruction to  implement
           <b>__sync</b>  <b>Builtins</b>.   However,  for  <b>__atomic</b> <b>Builtins</b> operating on 128-bit integers, a library call is
           always used.

       <b>-msahf</b>
           This option enables generation of "SAHF" instructions in 64-bit code.  Early  Intel  Pentium  4  CPUs
           with  Intel  64  support, prior to the introduction of Pentium 4 G1 step in December 2005, lacked the
           "LAHF" and "SAHF" instructions which are supported by AMD64.  These are load and store  instructions,
           respectively,  for  certain status flags.  In 64-bit mode, the "SAHF" instruction is used to optimize
           "fmod", "drem", and "remainder" built-in functions; see <b>Other</b> <b>Builtins</b> for details.

       <b>-mmovbe</b>
           This  option  enables  use  of  the  "movbe"  instruction  to   implement   "__builtin_bswap32"   and
           "__builtin_bswap64".

       <b>-mshstk</b>
           The  <b>-mshstk</b>  option  enables  shadow  stack  built-in  functions  from  x86 Control-flow Enforcement
           Technology (CET).

       <b>-mcrc32</b>
           This  option   enables   built-in   functions   "__builtin_ia32_crc32qi",   "__builtin_ia32_crc32hi",
           "__builtin_ia32_crc32si" and "__builtin_ia32_crc32di" to generate the "crc32" machine instruction.

       <b>-mmwait</b>
           This  option  enables  built-in  functions  "__builtin_ia32_monitor",  and  "__builtin_ia32_mwait" to
           generate the "monitor" and "mwait" machine instructions.

       <b>-mrecip</b>
           This option enables use of "RCPSS" and "RSQRTSS" instructions (and their vectorized variants  "RCPPS"
           and  "RSQRTPS")  with  an additional Newton-Raphson step to increase precision instead of "DIVSS" and
           "SQRTSS" (and their  vectorized  variants)  for  single-precision  floating-point  arguments.   These
           instructions   are   generated   only  when  <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations</b>  is  enabled  together  with
           <b>-ffinite-math-only</b> and <b>-fno-trapping-math</b>.  Note that while the throughput of the sequence is  higher
           than the throughput of the non-reciprocal instruction, the precision of the sequence can be decreased
           by up to 2 ulp (i.e. the inverse of 1.0 equals 0.99999994).

           Note  that  GCC  implements  "1.0f/sqrtf(<u>x</u>)"  in  terms  of  "RSQRTSS"  (or  "RSQRTPS")  already with
           <b>-ffast-math</b> (or the above option combination), and doesn't need <b>-mrecip</b>.

           Also note that GCC emits the above  sequence  with  additional  Newton-Raphson  step  for  vectorized
           single-float  division  and  vectorized  sqrtf(<u>x</u>)  already  with  <b>-ffast-math</b>  (or  the  above option
           combination), and doesn't need <b>-mrecip</b>.

       <b>-mrecip=</b><u>opt</u>
           This option controls which reciprocal estimate instructions may be used.  <u>opt</u>  is  a  comma-separated
           list of options, which may be preceded by a <b>!</b> to invert the option:

           <b>all</b> Enable all estimate instructions.

           <b>default</b>
               Enable the default instructions, equivalent to <b>-mrecip</b>.

           <b>none</b>
               Disable all estimate instructions, equivalent to <b>-mno-recip</b>.

           <b>div</b> Enable the approximation for scalar division.

           <b>vec-div</b>
               Enable the approximation for vectorized division.

           <b>sqrt</b>
               Enable the approximation for scalar square root.

           <b>vec-sqrt</b>
               Enable the approximation for vectorized square root.

           So,  for  example,  <b>-mrecip=all,!sqrt</b> enables all of the reciprocal approximations, except for square
           root.

       <b>-mveclibabi=</b><u>type</u>
           Specifies the ABI type to use for vectorizing intrinsics using an external library.  Supported values
           for <u>type</u> are <b>svml</b> for the Intel short vector math library and <b>acml</b> for the AMD math core library.  To
           use this option, both <b>-ftree-vectorize</b> and <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations</b> have to  be  enabled,  and  an
           SVML or ACML ABI-compatible library must be specified at link time.

           GCC   currently   emits  calls  to  "vmldExp2",  "vmldLn2",  "vmldLog102",  "vmldPow2",  "vmldTanh2",
           "vmldTan2",  "vmldAtan2",   "vmldAtanh2",   "vmldCbrt2",   "vmldSinh2",   "vmldSin2",   "vmldAsinh2",

           "vmlsAsinh4",  "vmlsAsin4",  "vmlsCosh4",  "vmlsCos4", "vmlsAcosh4" and "vmlsAcos4" for corresponding
           function  type  when  <b>-mveclibabi=svml</b>  is  used,  and  "__vrd2_sin",   "__vrd2_cos",   "__vrd2_exp",
           "__vrd2_log",    "__vrd2_log2",    "__vrd2_log10",   "__vrs4_sinf",   "__vrs4_cosf",   "__vrs4_expf",
           "__vrs4_logf", "__vrs4_log2f", "__vrs4_log10f" and "__vrs4_powf" for the corresponding function  type
           when <b>-mveclibabi=acml</b> is used.

       <b>-mabi=</b><u>name</u>
           Generate  code for the specified calling convention.  Permissible values are <b>sysv</b> for the ABI used on
           GNU/Linux and other systems, and <b>ms</b> for the Microsoft ABI.  The default is to use the  Microsoft  ABI
           when  targeting  Microsoft  Windows  and  the  SysV  ABI  on all other systems.  You can control this
           behavior for specific functions by using the function attributes "ms_abi" and "sysv_abi".

       <b>-mforce-indirect-call</b>
           Force all calls to functions to be indirect. This is useful when using Intel Processor Trace where it
           generates more precise timing information for function calls.

       <b>-mmanual-endbr</b>
           Insert ENDBR instruction at function entry only via the "cf_check" function attribute. This is useful
           when used with the option <b>-fcf-protection=branch</b> to control ENDBR insertion at the function entry.

       <b>-mcall-ms2sysv-xlogues</b>
           Due to differences in 64-bit ABIs, any Microsoft ABI function that calls a System V ABI function must
           consider RSI, RDI and XMM6-15 as clobbered.  By default, the code  for  saving  and  restoring  these
           registers   is   emitted  inline,  resulting  in  fairly  lengthy  prologues  and  epilogues.   Using
           <b>-mcall-ms2sysv-xlogues</b> emits prologues and epilogues that use stubs in the static portion  of  libgcc
           to  perform  these  saves  and  restores,  thus  reducing  function  size  at the cost of a few extra
           instructions.

       <b>-mtls-dialect=</b><u>type</u>
           Generate code to access thread-local  storage  using  the  <b>gnu</b>  or  <b>gnu2</b>  conventions.   <b>gnu</b>  is  the
           conservative  default; <b>gnu2</b> is more efficient, but it may add compile- and run-time requirements that
           cannot be satisfied on all systems.

       <b>-mpush-args</b>
       <b>-mno-push-args</b>
           Use PUSH operations to store outgoing parameters.  This method is shorter and usually equally fast as
           method using SUB/MOV operations and is enabled by default.  In some cases disabling  it  may  improve
           performance because of improved scheduling and reduced dependencies.

       <b>-maccumulate-outgoing-args</b>
           If  enabled,  the maximum amount of space required for outgoing arguments is computed in the function
           prologue.  This is faster on most modern CPUs because of reduced  dependencies,  improved  scheduling
           and  reduced  stack  usage  when  the  preferred stack boundary is not equal to 2.  The drawback is a
           notable increase in code size.  This switch implies <b>-mno-push-args</b>.

       <b>-mthreads</b>
           Support thread-safe exception handling  on  MinGW.   Programs  that  rely  on  thread-safe  exception
           handling must compile and link all code with the <b>-mthreads</b> option.  When compiling, <b>-mthreads</b> defines
           <b>-D_MT</b>;  when  linking,  it  links in a special thread helper library <b>-lmingwthrd</b> which cleans up per-
           thread exception-handling data.

       <b>-mms-bitfields</b>
       <b>-mno-ms-bitfields</b>
           Enable/disable bit-field layout compatible with the native Microsoft Windows compiler.

           If "packed" is used on a structure, or if bit-fields are used, it may be that the Microsoft ABI  lays
           out  the  structure differently than the way GCC normally does.  Particularly when moving packed data
           between functions compiled with GCC and the native Microsoft compiler (either via function call or as
           data in a file), it may be necessary to access either format.

           This option is enabled by  default  for  Microsoft  Windows  targets.   This  behavior  can  also  be
           controlled  locally  by  use  of variable or type attributes.  For more information, see <b>x86</b> <b>Variable</b>
           <b>Attributes</b> and <b>x86</b> <b>Type</b> <b>Attributes</b>.

           The Microsoft structure layout algorithm is  fairly  simple  with  the  exception  of  the  bit-field
           packing.   The  padding and alignment of members of structures and whether a bit-field can straddle a
           storage-unit boundary are determine by these rules:

           1. Structure members are stored sequentially in the order in which they are
               declared: the first member has the lowest memory address and the last member the highest.

           2. Every data object has an alignment requirement.  The alignment requirement
               for all data except structures, unions, and arrays is either  the  size  of  the  object  or  the
               current  packing  size  (specified  with  either  the  "aligned" attribute or the "pack" pragma),
               whichever is less.  For structures, unions, and arrays, the alignment requirement is the  largest
               alignment requirement of its members.  Every object is allocated an offset so that:

                       offset % alignment_requirement == 0

           3. Adjacent bit-fields are packed into the same 1-, 2-, or 4-byte allocation
               unit  if  the  integral  types  are the same size and if the next bit-field fits into the current
               allocation unit without crossing the boundary imposed by the common alignment requirements of the
               bit-fields.

           MSVC interprets zero-length bit-fields in the following ways:

           1. If a zero-length bit-field is inserted between two bit-fields that
               are normally coalesced, the bit-fields are not coalesced.

               For example:

                       struct
                        {
                          unsigned long bf_1 : 12;
                          unsigned long : 0;
                          unsigned long bf_2 : 12;
                        } t1;

               The size of "t1" is 8 bytes with the zero-length bit-field.  If the  zero-length  bit-field  were
               removed, "t1"'s size would be 4 bytes.

           2. If a zero-length bit-field is inserted after a bit-field, "foo", and the
               alignment  of  the zero-length bit-field is greater than the member that follows it, "bar", "bar"
               is aligned as the type of the zero-length bit-field.

               For example:

                       struct
                        {
                          char foo : 4;
                          short : 0;
                          char bar;
                        } t2;

                       struct
                        {
                          char foo : 4;
                          short : 0;
                          double bar;
                        } t3;

               For "t2", "bar" is placed at offset 2, rather than offset 1.  Accordingly, the size of "t2" is 4.
               For "t3", the zero-length bit-field does not affect the alignment of "bar" or, as a  result,  the
               size of the structure.

               Taking this into account, it is important to note the following:

               1. If a zero-length bit-field follows a normal bit-field, the type of the
                   zero-length  bit-field  may affect the alignment of the structure as whole. For example, "t2"
                   has a size of 4 bytes, since the zero-length bit-field follows a normal bit-field, and is  of
                   type short.

               2. Even if a zero-length bit-field is not followed by a normal bit-field, it may
                   still affect the alignment of the structure:

                           struct
                            {
                              char foo : 6;
                              long : 0;
                            } t4;

                   Here, "t4" takes up 4 bytes.

           3. Zero-length bit-fields following non-bit-field members are ignored:
                       struct
                        {
                          char foo;
                          long : 0;
                          char bar;
                        } t5;

               Here, "t5" takes up 2 bytes.

       <b>-mno-align-stringops</b>
           Do  not  align  the  destination  of  inlined  string  operations.  This switch reduces code size and
           improves performance in case the destination is already aligned, but GCC doesn't know about it.

       <b>-minline-all-stringops</b>
           By default GCC inlines string operations only when the destination is known to be aligned to least  a
           4-byte  boundary.  This enables more inlining and increases code size, but may improve performance of
           code that depends on fast "memcpy" and  "memset"  for  short  lengths.   The  option  enables  inline
           expansion of "strlen" for all pointer alignments.

       <b>-minline-stringops-dynamically</b>
           For  string  operations  of unknown size, use run-time checks with inline code for small blocks and a
           library call for large blocks.

       <b>-mstringop-strategy=</b><u>alg</u>
           Override the internal decision heuristic for the particular algorithm  to  use  for  inlining  string
           operations.  The allowed values for <u>alg</u> are:

           <b>rep_4byte</b>
           <b>rep_8byte</b>
               Expand using i386 "rep" prefix of the specified size.

           <b>byte_loop</b>
           <b>loop</b>
           <b>unrolled_loop</b>
               Expand into an inline loop.

           <b>libcall</b>
               Always use a library call.

       <b>-mmemcpy-strategy=</b><u>strategy</u>
           Override  the  internal decision heuristic to decide if "__builtin_memcpy" should be inlined and what

           separated  list  of  <u>alg</u>:<u>max_size</u>:<u>dest_align</u>  triplets.   <u>alg</u>  is  specified  in <b>-mstringop-strategy</b>,
           <u>max_size</u> specifies the max byte size with which inline  algorithm  <u>alg</u>  is  allowed.   For  the  last
           triplet,  the  <u>max_size</u>  must  be  -1.  The <u>max_size</u> of the triplets in the list must be specified in
           increasing order.  The minimal byte size for <u>alg</u> is 0 for the first triplet and "<u>max_size</u> + 1" of the
           preceding range.

       <b>-mmemset-strategy=</b><u>strategy</u>
           The option is  similar  to  <b>-mmemcpy-strategy=</b>  except  that  it  is  to  control  "__builtin_memset"
           expansion.

       <b>-momit-leaf-frame-pointer</b>
           Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for leaf functions.  This avoids the instructions to save,
           set  up,  and  restore  frame  pointers and makes an extra register available in leaf functions.  The
           option <b>-fomit-leaf-frame-pointer</b> removes the frame pointer  for  leaf  functions,  which  might  make
           debugging harder.

       <b>-mtls-direct-seg-refs</b>
       <b>-mno-tls-direct-seg-refs</b>
           Controls  whether  TLS  variables may be accessed with offsets from the TLS segment register (%gs for
           32-bit, %fs for 64-bit), or whether the thread base pointer must be added.  Whether or  not  this  is
           valid depends on the operating system, and whether it maps the segment to cover the entire TLS area.

           For systems that use the GNU C Library, the default is on.

       <b>-msse2avx</b>
       <b>-mno-sse2avx</b>
           Specify  that  the  assembler should encode SSE instructions with VEX prefix.  The option <b>-mavx</b> turns
           this on by default.

       <b>-mfentry</b>
       <b>-mno-fentry</b>
           If profiling is active (<b>-pg</b>), put the profiling counter call  before  the  prologue.   Note:  On  x86
           architectures the attribute "ms_hook_prologue" isn't possible at the moment for <b>-mfentry</b> and <b>-pg</b>.

       <b>-mrecord-mcount</b>
       <b>-mno-record-mcount</b>
           If  profiling  is  active  (<b>-pg</b>),  generate  a  __mcount_loc  section  that contains pointers to each
           profiling call. This is useful for automatically patching and out calls.

       <b>-mnop-mcount</b>
       <b>-mno-nop-mcount</b>
           If profiling is active (<b>-pg</b>), generate the calls to the profiling functions as NOPs. This  is  useful
           when  they  should  be  patched  in  later  dynamically.  This  is  likely  only useful together with
           <b>-mrecord-mcount</b>.

       <b>-minstrument-return=</b><u>type</u>
           Instrument function exit in -pg -mfentry instrumented functions with call to specified function. This
           only instruments true returns ending with ret, but not sibling calls ending with  jump.  Valid  types
           are <u>none</u> to not instrument, <u>call</u> to generate a call to __return__, or <u>nop5</u> to generate a 5 byte nop.

       <b>-mrecord-return</b>
       <b>-mno-record-return</b>
           Generate a __return_loc section pointing to all return instrumentation code.

       <b>-mfentry-name=</b><u>name</u>
           Set name of __fentry__ symbol called at function entry for -pg -mfentry functions.

       <b>-mfentry-section=</b><u>name</u>
           Set name of section to record -mrecord-mcount calls (default __mcount_loc).

       <b>-mskip-rax-setup</b>
       <b>-mno-skip-rax-setup</b>
           When  generating  code for the x86-64 architecture with SSE extensions disabled, <b>-mskip-rax-setup</b> can
           be used to skip setting up RAX register when  there  are  no  variable  arguments  passed  in  vector
           registers.

           <b>Warning:</b>  Since  RAX  register  is  used to avoid unnecessarily saving vector registers on stack when
           passing variable arguments, the impacts of this option  are  callees  may  waste  some  stack  space,
           misbehave or jump to a random location.  GCC 4.4 or newer don't have those issues, regardless the RAX
           register value.

       <b>-m8bit-idiv</b>
       <b>-mno-8bit-idiv</b>
           On  some processors, like Intel Atom, 8-bit unsigned integer divide is much faster than 32-bit/64-bit
           integer divide.  This option generates a run-time check.  If both dividend  and  divisor  are  within
           range of 0 to 255, 8-bit unsigned integer divide is used instead of 32-bit/64-bit integer divide.

       <b>-mavx256-split-unaligned-load</b>
       <b>-mavx256-split-unaligned-store</b>
           Split 32-byte AVX unaligned load and store.

       <b>-mstack-protector-guard=</b><u>guard</u>
       <b>-mstack-protector-guard-reg=</b><u>reg</u>
       <b>-mstack-protector-guard-offset=</b><u>offset</u>
           Generate  stack  protection  code  using  canary at <u>guard</u>.  Supported locations are <b>global</b> for global
           canary or <b>tls</b> for per-thread canary in the TLS block (the default).  This option has effect only when
           <b>-fstack-protector</b> or <b>-fstack-protector-all</b> is specified.

           With     the     latter     choice     the      options      <b>-mstack-protector-guard-reg=</b><u>reg</u>      and
           <b>-mstack-protector-guard-offset=</b><u>offset</u>  furthermore specify which segment register (%fs or %gs) to use
           as base register for reading the canary, and from what offset from that base register.   The  default
           for those is as specified in the relevant ABI.

       <b>-mgeneral-regs-only</b>
           Generate  code  that  uses only the general-purpose registers.  This prevents the compiler from using
           floating-point, vector, mask and bound registers.

       <b>-mindirect-branch=</b><u>choice</u>
           Convert indirect call and jump with <u>choice</u>.  The default is <b>keep</b>, which keeps indirect call and  jump
           unmodified.   <b>thunk</b>  converts indirect call and jump to call and return thunk.  <b>thunk-inline</b> converts
           indirect call and jump to inlined call and return thunk.  <b>thunk-extern</b>  converts  indirect  call  and
           jump  to  external  call  and  return thunk provided in a separate object file.  You can control this
           behavior for a specific function by using the function attribute "indirect_branch".

           Note     that     <b>-mcmodel=large</b>     is     incompatible     with     <b>-mindirect-branch=thunk</b>     and
           <b>-mindirect-branch=thunk-extern</b> since the thunk function may not be reachable in the large code model.

           Note that <b>-mindirect-branch=thunk-extern</b> is compatible with <b>-fcf-protection=branch</b> since the external
           thunk can be made to enable control-flow check.

       <b>-mfunction-return=</b><u>choice</u>
           Convert  function  return  with <u>choice</u>.  The default is <b>keep</b>, which keeps function return unmodified.
           <b>thunk</b> converts function return to call and return thunk.  <b>thunk-inline</b> converts  function  return  to
           inlined  call  and  return  thunk.  <b>thunk-extern</b> converts function return to external call and return
           thunk provided in a separate object file.  You can control this behavior for a specific  function  by
           using the function attribute "function_return".

           Note that <b>-mindirect-return=thunk-extern</b> is compatible with <b>-fcf-protection=branch</b> since the external
           thunk can be made to enable control-flow check.

           Note     that     <b>-mcmodel=large</b>     is     incompatible     with     <b>-mfunction-return=thunk</b>     and
           <b>-mfunction-return=thunk-extern</b> since the thunk function may not be reachable in the large code model.

       <b>-mindirect-branch-register</b>
           Force indirect call and jump via register.

       <b>-mharden-sls=</b><u>choice</u>
           Generate code to mitigate against straight line speculation (SLS) with <u>choice</u>.  The default  is  <b>none</b>
           which  disables  all SLS hardening.  <b>return</b> enables SLS hardening for function returns.  <b>indirect-jmp</b>
           enables SLS hardening for indirect jumps.  <b>all</b> enables all SLS hardening.

       <b>-mindirect-branch-cs-prefix</b>
           Add CS prefix to call and jmp to indirect thunk with branch target in r8-r15 registers  so  that  the
           call and jmp instruction length is 6 bytes to allow them to be replaced with <b>lfence;</b> <b>call</b> <b>*%r8-r15</b> or
           <b>lfence;</b> <b>jmp</b> <b>*%r8-r15</b> at run-time.

       These <b>-m</b> switches are supported in addition to the above on x86-64 processors in 64-bit environments.

       <b>-m32</b>
       <b>-m64</b>
       <b>-mx32</b>
       <b>-m16</b>
       <b>-miamcu</b>
           Generate  code  for  a 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit environment.  The <b>-m32</b> option sets "int", "long", and
           pointer types to 32 bits, and generates code that runs in 32-bit mode.

           The <b>-m64</b> option sets "int" to 32 bits and "long" and pointer types to 64 bits, and generates code for
           the x86-64 architecture.   For  Darwin  only  the  <b>-m64</b>  option  also  turns  off  the  <b>-fno-pic</b>  and
           <b>-mdynamic-no-pic</b> options.

           The  <b>-mx32</b> option sets "int", "long", and pointer types to 32 bits, and generates code for the x86-64
           architecture.

           The <b>-m16</b> option is the same as <b>-m32</b>, except for that it outputs the ".code16gcc"  assembly  directive
           at the beginning of the assembly output so that the binary can run in 16-bit mode.

           The  <b>-miamcu</b> option generates code which conforms to Intel MCU psABI.  It requires the <b>-m32</b> option to
           be turned on.

       <b>-mno-red-zone</b>
           Do not use a so-called "red zone" for x86-64 code.  The red zone is mandated by the x86-64 ABI; it is
           a 128-byte area beyond the location of the stack pointer that is not modified by signal or  interrupt
           handlers  and therefore can be used for temporary data without adjusting the stack pointer.  The flag
           <b>-mno-red-zone</b> disables this red zone.

       <b>-mcmodel=small</b>
           Generate code for the small code model: the program and its symbols must be linked in the lower 2  GB
           of the address space.  Pointers are 64 bits.  Programs can be statically or dynamically linked.  This
           is the default code model.

       <b>-mcmodel=kernel</b>
           Generate  code for the kernel code model.  The kernel runs in the negative 2 GB of the address space.
           This model has to be used for Linux kernel code.

       <b>-mcmodel=medium</b>
           Generate code for the medium model: the program is linked in the lower 2 GB  of  the  address  space.
           Small  symbols  are also placed there.  Symbols with sizes larger than <b>-mlarge-data-threshold</b> are put
           into large data or BSS sections and can  be  located  above  2GB.   Programs  can  be  statically  or
           dynamically linked.

       <b>-mcmodel=large</b>
           Generate  code  for  the  large  model.  This model makes no assumptions about addresses and sizes of
           sections.

       <b>-maddress-mode=long</b>
           Generate code for long address mode.  This is only supported for 64-bit and x32 environments.  It  is
           the default address mode for 64-bit environments.

       <b>-maddress-mode=short</b>
           Generate code for short address mode.  This is only supported for 32-bit and x32 environments.  It is
           the default address mode for 32-bit and x32 environments.

       <b>-mneeded</b>
       <b>-mno-needed</b>
           Emit  GNU_PROPERTY_X86_ISA_1_NEEDED  GNU property for Linux target to indicate the micro-architecture
           ISA level required to execute the binary.

       <u>x86</u> <u>Windows</u> <u>Options</u>

       These additional options are available for Microsoft Windows targets:

       <b>-mconsole</b>
           This option specifies that a console application is to be generated, by instructing the linker to set
           the PE header subsystem type required for console applications.  This option is available for  Cygwin
           and MinGW targets and is enabled by default on those targets.

       <b>-mdll</b>
           This  option  is  available  for  Cygwin and MinGW targets.  It specifies that a DLL---a dynamic link
           library---is to be generated, enabling the selection of the required runtime startup object and entry
           point.

       <b>-mnop-fun-dllimport</b>
           This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets.  It specifies that the  "dllimport"  attribute
           should be ignored.

       <b>-mthread</b>
           This  option is available for MinGW targets. It specifies that MinGW-specific thread support is to be
           used.

       <b>-municode</b>
           This option is available for MinGW-w64 targets.  It causes the "UNICODE"  preprocessor  macro  to  be
           predefined, and chooses Unicode-capable runtime startup code.

       <b>-mwin32</b>
           This  option  is  available  for  Cygwin  and MinGW targets.  It specifies that the typical Microsoft
           Windows predefined macros are to be set in the pre-processor, but does not influence  the  choice  of
           runtime library/startup code.

       <b>-mwindows</b>
           This  option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets.  It specifies that a GUI application is to be
           generated by instructing the linker to set the PE header subsystem type appropriately.

       <b>-fno-set-stack-executable</b>
           This option is available for MinGW targets. It specifies that the executable flag for the stack  used
           by  nested  functions  isn't  set. This is necessary for binaries running in kernel mode of Microsoft
           Windows, as there the User32 API, which is used to set executable privileges, isn't available.

       <b>-fwritable-relocated-rdata</b>
           This option is available for MinGW and Cygwin targets.  It specifies that relocated-data in read-only
           section is put into the ".data" section.  This is a  necessary  for  older  runtimes  not  supporting
           modification of ".rdata" sections for pseudo-relocation.

       <b>-mpe-aligned-commons</b>
           This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets.  It specifies that the GNU extension to the PE
           file  format  that  permits  the correct alignment of COMMON variables should be used when generating
           code.  It is enabled by default if GCC detects that the target assembler found  during  configuration
           supports the feature.

       See also under <b>x86</b> <b>Options</b> for standard options.

       <u>Xstormy16</u> <u>Options</u>

       These options are defined for Xstormy16:

       <b>-msim</b>
           Choose startup files and linker script suitable for the simulator.

       <u>Xtensa</u> <u>Options</u>

       These options are supported for Xtensa targets:

       <b>-mconst16</b>
       <b>-mno-const16</b>
           Enable  or  disable  use  of  "CONST16"  instructions  for  loading  constant  values.  The "CONST16"
           instruction is currently not a standard option from Tensilica.  When enabled, "CONST16"  instructions
           are  always  used  in  place of the standard "L32R" instructions.  The use of "CONST16" is enabled by
           default only if the "L32R" instruction is not available.

       <b>-mfused-madd</b>
       <b>-mno-fused-madd</b>
           Enable or disable use of fused multiply/add and multiply/subtract instructions in the  floating-point
           option.   This  has  no  effect  if  the  floating-point option is not also enabled.  Disabling fused
           multiply/add and multiply/subtract instructions forces the compiler to use separate instructions  for
           the  multiply  and  add/subtract  operations.   This may be desirable in some cases where strict IEEE
           754-compliant results are required: the fused multiply add/subtract instructions  do  not  round  the
           intermediate result, thereby producing results with <u>more</u> bits of precision than specified by the IEEE
           standard.  Disabling fused multiply add/subtract instructions also ensures that the program output is
           not sensitive to the compiler's ability to combine multiply and add/subtract operations.

       <b>-mserialize-volatile</b>
       <b>-mno-serialize-volatile</b>
           When  this  option is enabled, GCC inserts "MEMW" instructions before "volatile" memory references to
           guarantee sequential consistency.  The default is <b>-mserialize-volatile</b>.  Use  <b>-mno-serialize-volatile</b>
           to omit the "MEMW" instructions.

       <b>-mforce-no-pic</b>
           For targets, like GNU/Linux, where all user-mode Xtensa code must be position-independent code (PIC),
           this option disables PIC for compiling kernel code.

       <b>-mtext-section-literals</b>
       <b>-mno-text-section-literals</b>
           These  options  control  the  treatment of literal pools.  The default is <b>-mno-text-section-literals</b>,
           which places literals in a separate section in the output file.  This allows the literal pool  to  be
           placed in a data RAM/ROM, and it also allows the linker to combine literal pools from separate object
           files to remove redundant literals and improve code size.  With <b>-mtext-section-literals</b>, the literals
           are  interspersed in the text section in order to keep them as close as possible to their references.
           This may be necessary for large assembly files.  Literals for each function are placed  right  before
           that function.

       <b>-mauto-litpools</b>
       <b>-mno-auto-litpools</b>
           These  options  control  the  treatment  of  literal pools.  The default is <b>-mno-auto-litpools</b>, which
           places literals in a separate section in the output  file  unless  <b>-mtext-section-literals</b>  is  used.
           With  <b>-mauto-litpools</b>  the  literals are interspersed in the text section by the assembler.  Compiler
           does not produce explicit ".literal"  directives  and  loads  literals  into  registers  with  "MOVI"
           instructions  instead  of  "L32R" to let the assembler do relaxation and place literals as necessary.
           This option allows assembler to create several literal pools  per  function  and  assemble  very  big
           functions, which may not be possible with <b>-mtext-section-literals</b>.

       <b>-mtarget-align</b>
       <b>-mno-target-align</b>
           When  this  option  is  enabled,  GCC  instructs the assembler to automatically align instructions to
           reduce branch penalties at the expense of some code density.  The assembler attempts to widen density
           instructions to align branch targets and the instructions following call instructions.  If there  are
           not  enough  preceding  safe  density  instructions to align a target, no widening is performed.  The
           default is <b>-mtarget-align</b>.  These options do not affect the treatment  of  auto-aligned  instructions
           like  "LOOP",  which  the  assembler  always  aligns,  either  by widening density instructions or by
           inserting NOP instructions.

       <b>-mlongcalls</b>
       <b>-mno-longcalls</b>
           When this option is enabled, GCC instructs the assembler to translate direct calls to indirect  calls
           unless  it  can  determine  that  the  target  of  a  direct call is in the range allowed by the call
           instruction.  This translation typically occurs  for  calls  to  functions  in  other  source  files.
           Specifically,  the  assembler  translates  a  direct  "CALL" instruction into an "L32R" followed by a
           "CALLX" instruction.  The default is <b>-mno-longcalls</b>.  This option should be used  in  programs  where
           the  call  target  can potentially be out of range.  This option is implemented in the assembler, not
           the compiler, so the assembly code generated by GCC still shows direct  call  instructions---look  at
           the  disassembled  object  code  to  see  the  actual  instructions.  Note that the assembler uses an
           indirect call for every cross-file call, not just those that really are out of range.

       <b>-mabi=</b><u>name</u>
           Generate code for the specified ABI.  Permissible values are: <b>call0</b>, <b>windowed</b>.  Default ABI is chosen
           by the Xtensa core configuration.

       <b>-mabi=call0</b>
           When this option is enabled function parameters are passed in registers "a2" through "a7",  registers
           "a12"  through  "a15" are caller-saved, and register "a15" may be used as a frame pointer.  When this
           version of the ABI is enabled the C preprocessor symbol "__XTENSA_CALL0_ABI__" is defined.

       <b>-mabi=windowed</b>
           When this option is enabled function parameters are passed in  registers  "a10"  through  "a15",  and
           called  function  rotates  register window by 8 registers on entry so that its arguments are found in
           registers "a2" through "a7".  Register "a7" may be used as  a  frame  pointer.   Register  window  is
           rotated  8  registers  back  upon return.  When this version of the ABI is enabled the C preprocessor
           symbol "__XTENSA_WINDOWED_ABI__" is defined.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       This section describes several environment variables that affect how GCC operates.  Some of them work  by
       specifying  directories  or  prefixes to use when searching for various kinds of files.  Some are used to
       specify other aspects of the compilation environment.

       Note that you can also specify places to search using  options  such  as  <b>-B</b>,  <b>-I</b>  and  <b>-L</b>.   These  take
       precedence  over  places  specified using environment variables, which in turn take precedence over those
       specified by the configuration of GCC.

       <b>LANG</b>
       <b>LC_CTYPE</b>
       <b>LC_MESSAGES</b>
       <b>LC_ALL</b>
           These environment variables control the way that GCC uses localization information which  allows  GCC
           to  work  with  different  national  conventions.   GCC  inspects  the locale categories <b>LC_CTYPE</b> and
           <b>LC_MESSAGES</b> if it has been configured to do so.  These locale categories can  be  set  to  any  value
           supported  by  your  installation.   A typical value is <b>en_GB.UTF-8</b> for English in the United Kingdom
           encoded in UTF-8.

           The <b>LC_CTYPE</b> environment variable specifies character classification.  GCC uses it to  determine  the
           character  boundaries in a string; this is needed for some multibyte encodings that contain quote and
           escape characters that are otherwise interpreted as a string end or escape.

           The <b>LC_MESSAGES</b> environment variable specifies the language to use in diagnostic messages.

           If the <b>LC_ALL</b> environment variable is set, it  overrides  the  value  of  <b>LC_CTYPE</b>  and  <b>LC_MESSAGES</b>;
           otherwise,  <b>LC_CTYPE</b>  and <b>LC_MESSAGES</b> default to the value of the <b>LANG</b> environment variable.  If none
           of these variables are set, GCC defaults to traditional C English behavior.

       <b>TMPDIR</b>
           If <b>TMPDIR</b> is set, it specifies the directory to use for temporary files.  GCC uses temporary files to
           hold the output of one stage of compilation which is to be used as  input  to  the  next  stage:  for
           example, the output of the preprocessor, which is the input to the compiler proper.

       <b>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</b>
           Setting  <b>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</b>  is  nearly  equivalent to passing <b>-fcompare-debug</b> to the compiler driver.
           See the documentation of this option for more details.

       <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b>
           If <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b> is set, it specifies a prefix to use in the names of the subprograms  executed  by
           the  compiler.  No slash is added when this prefix is combined with the name of a subprogram, but you
           can specify a prefix that ends with a slash if you wish.

           If <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b> is not set, GCC attempts to figure out an appropriate prefix to use based  on  the
           pathname it is invoked with.

           If  GCC  cannot  find the subprogram using the specified prefix, it tries looking in the usual places
           for the subprogram.

           The default value of <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b> is <u>prefix/lib/gcc/</u> where <u>prefix</u> is the prefix to  the  installed
           compiler. In many cases <u>prefix</u> is the value of "prefix" when you ran the <u>configure</u> script.

           Other prefixes specified with <b>-B</b> take precedence over this prefix.

           This prefix is also used for finding files such as <u>crt0.o</u> that are used for linking.

           In  addition,  the  prefix  is used in an unusual way in finding the directories to search for header
           files.  For each of the standard directories whose name normally begins with <b>/usr/local/lib/gcc</b> (more
           precisely, with the value of <b>GCC_INCLUDE_DIR</b>), GCC tries replacing that beginning with the  specified
           prefix  to  produce an alternate directory name.  Thus, with <b>-Bfoo/</b>, GCC searches <u>foo/bar</u> just before
           it searches the standard directory <u>/usr/local/lib/bar</u>.  If  a  standard  directory  begins  with  the
           configured  <u>prefix</u>  then  the  value of <u>prefix</u> is replaced by <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b> when looking for header
           files.

       <b>COMPILER_PATH</b>
           The value of <b>COMPILER_PATH</b> is a colon-separated list of directories, much like <b>PATH</b>.  GCC  tries  the
           directories  thus  specified  when searching for subprograms, if it cannot find the subprograms using
           <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b>.

       <b>LIBRARY_PATH</b>
           The value of <b>LIBRARY_PATH</b> is a colon-separated list of directories, much like <b>PATH</b>.  When  configured
           as  a  native  compiler,  GCC  tries the directories thus specified when searching for special linker
           files, if it cannot find them using <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b>.  Linking using GCC also uses  these  directories
           when  searching  for  ordinary  libraries  for  the <b>-l</b> option (but directories specified with <b>-L</b> come
           first).

       <b>LANG</b>
           This variable is used to pass locale information to the compiler.  One way in which this  information
           is  used  is  to  determine the character set to be used when character literals, string literals and
           comments are parsed in C and C++.  When the compiler is configured to allow multibyte characters, the
           following values for <b>LANG</b> are recognized:

           <b>C-JIS</b>
               Recognize JIS characters.

           <b>C-SJIS</b>
               Recognize SJIS characters.

           <b>C-EUCJP</b>
               Recognize EUCJP characters.

           If <b>LANG</b> is not defined, or if it has some other value, then the compiler uses "mblen" and "mbtowc" as
           defined by the default locale to recognize and translate multibyte characters.

       <b>GCC_EXTRA_DIAGNOSTIC_OUTPUT</b>
           If <b>GCC_EXTRA_DIAGNOSTIC_OUTPUT</b> is set to one of the following values, then additional  text  will  be
           emitted   to   stderr   when   fix-it   hints   are   emitted.    <b>-fdiagnostics-parseable-fixits</b>  and
           <b>-fno-diagnostics-parseable-fixits</b> take precedence over this environment variable.

           <b>fixits-v1</b>
               Emit parseable  fix-it  hints,  equivalent  to  <b>-fdiagnostics-parseable-fixits</b>.   In  particular,
               columns are expressed as a count of bytes, starting at byte 1 for the initial column.

           <b>fixits-v2</b>
               As    "fixits-v1",    but    columns    are    expressed    as    display    columns,    as   per
               <b>-fdiagnostics-column-unit=display</b>.

       Some additional environment variables affect the behavior of the preprocessor.

       <b>CPATH</b>
       <b>C_INCLUDE_PATH</b>
       <b>CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH</b>
       <b>OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH</b>
           Each variable's value is a list of directories separated by a special character, much like  <b>PATH</b>,  in
           which  to  look  for  header files.  The special character, "PATH_SEPARATOR", is target-dependent and
           determined at GCC build time.  For Microsoft Windows-based targets it is a semicolon, and for  almost
           all other targets it is a colon.

           <b>CPATH</b>  specifies  a  list  of directories to be searched as if specified with <b>-I</b>, but after any paths
           given with <b>-I</b> options on the command line.  This environment variable is  used  regardless  of  which
           language is being preprocessed.

           The  remaining environment variables apply only when preprocessing the particular language indicated.
           Each specifies a list of directories to be searched as if specified  with  <b>-isystem</b>,  but  after  any
           paths given with <b>-isystem</b> options on the command line.

           In  all  these  variables,  an  empty  element  instructs  the compiler to search its current working
           directory.  Empty elements can appear at the beginning or end of a path.  For instance, if the  value
           of <b>CPATH</b> is ":/special/include", that has the same effect as <b>-I.</b> <b>-I/special/include</b>.

       <b>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</b>
           If  this  variable  is set, its value specifies how to output dependencies for Make based on the non-
           system header files processed by the compiler.  System header files are  ignored  in  the  dependency
           output.

           The value of <b>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</b> can be just a file name, in which case the Make rules are written to
           that  file,  guessing the target name from the source file name.  Or the value can have the form <u>file</u>
           <u>target</u>, in which case the rules are written to file <u>file</u> using <u>target</u> as the target name.

           In other words, this environment variable is equivalent to combining the options <b>-MM</b> and <b>-MF</b>, with an
           optional <b>-MT</b> switch too.

       <b>SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES</b>
           This variable is the same as <b>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</b> (see above), except that system header files are not
           ignored, so it implies <b>-M</b> rather than <b>-MM</b>.  However,  the  dependence  on  the  main  input  file  is
           omitted.

       <b>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</b>
           If  this  variable  is  set,  its  value  specifies a UNIX timestamp to be used in replacement of the
           current date and time in the "__DATE__" and "__TIME__" macros, so that the embedded timestamps become
           reproducible.

           The value of <b>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</b> must be a UNIX timestamp, defined as the number of seconds  (excluding
           leap  seconds) since 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 represented in ASCII; identical to the output of "date +%s"
           on GNU/Linux and other systems that support the %s extension in the "date" command.

           The value should be a known timestamp such as the last modification time of the source or package and
           it should be set by the build process.

       1.  On some systems, <b>gcc</b> <b>-shared</b> needs to build supplementary stub code for  constructors  to  work.   On
           multi-libbed systems, <b>gcc</b> <b>-shared</b> must select the correct support libraries to link against.  Failing
           to  supply  the correct flags may lead to subtle defects.  Supplying them in cases where they are not
           necessary is innocuous.
