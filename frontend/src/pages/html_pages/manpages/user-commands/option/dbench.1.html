       dbench - Measure disk throughput for simulated netbench run

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dbench</b> [<u>options</u>]<u>numclients</u>
       <b>tbench</b> [<u>options</u>]<u>numclients</u>server <b>tbench_srv</b> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  documents briefly the <b>dbench</b> and <b>tbench</b> benchmarks.  This manual page was written for
       the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  However,  it
       has fairly easy to read source code.

       Netbench  is  a terrible benchmark, but it's an "industry standard" and it's what is used in the press to
       rate windows fileservers like Samba and WindowsNT.
       Given the requirements of running netbench (60 and 150 Windows PCs all on switched fast  ethernet  and  a
       really  grunty  server,  and  some  way  to  nurse all those machines along so they will run a very fussy
       benchmark suite without crashing), these programs were written to open up netbench to the masses.
       Both <b>dbench</b> and <b>tbench</b> read a load description file called client.txt that was  derived  from  a  network
       sniffer  dump  of  a  real netbench run. client.txt is about 4MB and describes the 90 thousand operations
       that a netbench client does in a typical netbench run. They parse client.txt and use it  to  produce  the
       same load without having to buy a huge lab.
       dbench  produces  only  the  filesystem load. It does all the same IO calls that the smbd server in Samba
       would produce when confronted with a netbench run. It does no networking calls.
       tbench produces only the TCP and process load. It does the same socket calls that smbd would do  under  a
       netbench load. It does no filesystem calls. The idea behind tbench is to eliminate smbd from the netbench
       test, as though the smbd code could be made infinately fast.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>dbench</b>  program takes a number, which indicates the number of clients to run simultaneously.  It can
       also take the following options:

       <b>-c</b> <b>client.txt</b>
              Use   this   as   the   full   path   name   of   the   client.txt   file    (the    default    is
              /usr/share/dbench/client.txt).

       <b>-s</b>     Use synchronous file IO on all file operations.

       <b>-t</b> <b>TIME</b>
              set the runtime of the benchmark in seconds (default 600)

       <b>-D</b> <b>DIR</b> set the base directory to run the filesystem operations in

       <b>-x</b>     enable xattr support, simulating the xattr operations Samba4 would need to perform to run the load

       <b>-S</b>     Use synchronous IO for all directory operations (unlink, rmdir, mkdir and rename).
              The  <b>tbench</b>  program  takes a number, which indicates the number of clients to run simultaneously,
              and a server name: <b>tbench_srv</b> should be invoked on that server before invoking <b>tbench</b>.  <b>tbench</b> can
              also take the following options:

       <b>-T</b> <b>option[,...]</b>
              This sets the socket options for the connection to the server.  The options are a  comma-separated
              list  of  one  or  more  of  the  following: <b>SO_KEEPALIVE</b>, <b>SO_REUSEADDR</b>, <b>SO_BROADCAST</b>, <b>SO_NODELAY</b>,
              <b>SO_LOWDELAY</b>,    <b>SO_THROUGHPUT</b>,     <b>SO_SNDBUF</b>=number,     <b>SO_RCVBUF</b>=number,     <b>SO_SNDLOWAT</b>=number,
              <b>SO_RCVLOWAT</b>=number,  <b>SO_SNDTIMEO</b>=number,<b>and</b>  <b>SO_RCVTIMEO</b>=number.   See <b><a href="../man7/socket.7.html">socket</a></b>(7) for details about
              these options.
              The <b>tbench_srv</b> can only take one option: <b>-T</b> <b>option[,...]</b>  as documented above.
