       ccrypt - encrypt and decrypt files and streams

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ccrypt</b> <b>[</b><u>mode</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>options</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>file...</u><b>]</b>
       <b>ccencrypt</b> <b>[</b><u>options</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>file...</u><b>]</b>
       <b>ccdecrypt</b> <b>[</b><u>options</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>file...</u><b>]</b>
       <b>ccat</b> <b>[</b><u>options</u><b>]</b> <u>file...</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ccrypt</b>  is  a  tool  for  encrypting  and decrypting files and streams. It is based on the Rijndael block
       cipher,  a  version  of  which  is  also  used  in   the   Advanced   Encryption   Standard   (AES,   see
       <a href="http://www.nist.gov/aes">http://www.nist.gov/aes</a>). This cipher is believed to provide very strong cryptographic security.

       The  algorithm provided by <b>ccrypt</b> is not symmetric, i.e., one must specify whether to encrypt or decrypt.
       The most common way to invoke <b>ccrypt</b> is via the commands <b>ccencrypt</b> and <b>ccdecrypt</b>.

       Encryption and decryption depends on a keyword (or key phrase) supplied by the user. By default, the user
       is prompted to enter a keyword from the terminal. Keywords can consist of any number of  characters,  and
       all  characters  are significant (although <b>ccrypt</b> internally hashes the key to 256 bits). Longer keywords
       provide better security than short ones, since they are  less  likely  to  be  discovered  by  exhaustive
       search.

</pre><h4><b>MODES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ccrypt</b>  can  operate in five different modes.  If more than one mode is specified, the last one specified
       takes precedence. The aliases <b>ccencrypt</b>, <b>ccdecrypt</b>, and <b>ccat</b> are provided  as  a  convenience;  they  are
       equivalent to <b>ccrypt</b> <b>-e</b>, <b>ccrypt</b> <b>-d</b>, and <b>ccrypt</b> <b>-c</b>, respectively.

       <b>-e,</b> <b>--encrypt</b>  Encrypt.  This is the default mode. If filename arguments are given, encrypt the files and
                      append the suffix <b>.cpt</b> to their names. Otherwise, run as a filter.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--decrypt</b>  Decrypt. If filename arguments are given, decrypt the files and strip the suffix <b>.cpt</b> from
                      the filenames, if present. Otherwise, run as a filter.

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--cat</b>      Decrypt one or more files to standard output. If no filename arguments are given,  decrypt
                      as a filter. A filename of "-" is interpreted as reading from standard input. Implies <b>-l</b>.

       <b>-x,</b> <b>--keychange</b>
                      Change  the key of encrypted data. In this mode, <b>ccrypt</b> prompts for two passwords: the old
                      one and the new one.  If filename arguments are given, modify the files. Otherwise, run as
                      a filter.

       <b>-u,</b> <b>--unixcrypt</b>
                      Simulate the <b><a href="../man1/crypt.1.html">crypt</a></b>(1) command-line encryption tool that used to exist  on  very  old  Unix
                      systems from about 1979 until the 1990s. Note: the cipher used by the old <b><a href="../man1/crypt.1.html">crypt</a></b>(1) tool is
                      not  secure  and  has  been  broken.  This option is provided only for decrypting existing
                      files.  If filename arguments are given, decrypt the files to stdout. Otherwise, run as  a
                      filter. A filename of "-" is interpreted as reading from standard input. Since there is no
                      easy  way  to  detect  whether  a given key matches or not, for safety, this mode does not
                      overwrite files.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are supported in addition to the modes described above:

       <b>-b,</b> <b>--brave</b>    When reading an encryption key from the terminal, ask the user only once for the  key.  By
                      default,  <b>ccrypt</b>  will  ask  the  user  to  enter  such keys twice, as a safeguard against
                      accidentally destroying data due to a mistyped key. Using the <b>--brave</b> option disables this
                      safety check. Never use it, unless you know what you are doing. See also <b>--timid</b>.

       <b>-E</b> <u>var</u><b>,</b> <b>--envvar</b> <u>var</u>
                      Read the keyword from the environment variable <u>var</u>.  Note that this  might  be  unsafe  on
                      certain  systems,  namely  where  users can use the <b>ps</b> command to see the environment of a
                      process owner by another user. On most modern systems, however, such  behavior  of  <b>ps</b>  is
                      disabled  and  the  <b>-E</b>  option  should be safe there.  Also, as an added security measure,
                      <b>ccrypt</b> erases the keyword from its environment immediately after reading it.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--force</b>    Overwrite existing files or operate on write-protected files without asking any questions.
                      Also, override <b>ccrypt</b>'s reluctance to write or read encrypted data to or from a terminal.

       <b>-F</b> <u>var</u><b>,</b> <b>--envvar2</b> <u>var</u>
                      Same as <b>-E</b>, except for second keyword (in keychange mode).

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>     Help. Print usage information and exit.

       <b>-H</b> <u>key</u><b>,</b> <b>--key2</b> <u>key</u>
                      Same as <b>-K</b>, except for second keyword (in keychange mode).

       <b>-k</b> <u>file</u><b>,</b> <b>--keyfile</b> <u>file</u>
                      Read the keyword as the first line from the named file. In keychange  mode,  two  keywords
                      are  read  as  the  first two lines of the file. The filename "-" may be given for reading
                      keywords from standard input.  Using the <b>-k</b> <b>-</b> option and sending the keyword on  stdin  is
                      probably the safest way to pass a keyword to <b>ccrypt</b> from another program or script.

       <b>-K</b> <u>key</u><b>,</b> <b>--key</b> <u>key</u>
                      Specify  the  keyword  on the command line. This is unsafe, because any other user can see
                      the command line by running the <b>ps</b> command.  Only use this option  for  testing  purposes,
                      and never with a real keyword.

       <b>-y</b> <u>file</u><b>,</b> <b>--keyref</b> <u>file</u>
                      In  encryption  or  keychange mode, check the encryption key against the named file, which
                      must have been previously encrypted with the same key. Exit with an error message  if  the
                      key  does  not match. This option is useful as an alternative to <b>--timid</b>, to guard against
                      mistyped keys in situations where several files are encrypted  with  the  same  key.  This
                      option  implies  <b>--brave</b>, unless the <b>--timid</b> option is explicitly given after the <b>--keyref</b>
                      option.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--symlinks</b> Force encryption/decryption of symbolic links. By  default,  symbolic  links  are  ignored
                      except  in cat or unixcrypt mode. Note that with the <b>-l</b> option, encryption/decryption of a
                      symbolic link causes the suffix <b>.cpt</b> to be added/removed from the name of  the  link,  not
                      the name of the file pointed to.

       <b>-L,</b> <b>--license</b>  Print license info and exit.

       <b>-m,</b> <b>--mismatch</b> Normally,  <b>ccrypt</b>  refuses  to decrypt data with a key that does not seem to match. The <b>-m</b>
                      option overrides this restriction. This can sometimes be useful in recovering data from  a
                      corrupted  file (see RECOVERING DATA FROM CORRUPTED FILES). To avoid irretrievable loss of
                      data when decrypting with a wrong  key,  this  option  cannot  be  used  with  modes  that
                      overwrite the input file.

       <b>-P</b> <u>prompt</u><b>,</b> <b>--prompt</b> <u>prompt</u>
                      Use <u>prompt</u> instead of the default prompt "Enter encryption/decryption key: ".  This may be
                      useful in some shell scripts.

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b>    Suppress most warnings.

       <b>-Q</b> <u>prompt</u><b>,</b> <b>--prompt2</b> <u>prompt</u>
                      Same as <b>-P</b>, except for second keyword (in keychange mode).

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--recursive</b>
                      Traverse subdirectories recursively.

       <b>-R,</b> <b>--rec-symlinks</b>
                      Traverse subdirectories recursively, and also follow symbolic links to subdirectories.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--strictsuffix</b>
                      Refuse to encrypt files that already have the <b>.cpt</b> suffix (or that selected with <b>-S</b>). This
                      can  be  useful  when  adding  some  files to a directory of already encrypted files. This
                      option has no effect in decryption or keychange mode.

       <b>-S</b> <u>.suf</u><b>,</b> <b>--suffix</b> <u>.suf</u>
                      Use the suffix <u>.suf</u> instead of the default suffix <b>.cpt</b>.

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--timid</b>    When reading an encryption key from the terminal, ask the user to enter the key twice.  If
                      the  two  entered keys are not identical, abort.  This is a safeguard against accidentally
                      destroying data by encrypting it with a mistyped key.  Note:  this  behavior  is  now  the
                      default, and can be overridden with the <b>--brave</b> option.

       <b>-T,</b> <b>--tmpfiles</b> This option causes <b>ccrypt</b> to use temporary files during encryption/decryption, rather than
                      overwriting the file contents destructively. This method leaves the original file contents
                      lying  around  in  unused  sectors  of  the  file system, and thus is less secure than the
                      default behavior. However, in situations where this loss of security is not important, the
                      <b>--tmpfiles</b> option can provide a measure of protection against data being corrupted due  to
                      a system crash in the middle of overwriting a file.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>  Print progress information to stderr.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>  Print version info and exit.

       <b>--</b>             End of options. Any remaining arguments are interpreted as filenames.  This also turns off
                      filter  mode,  even if zero filenames follow. This might be useful in the context of shell
                      pattern expansion; <b>ccrypt</b> <b>--</b> <b>*</b> will behave correctly even if no files match the pattern <b>*</b>.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b> <b>ON</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The user interface of <b>ccrypt</b> intentionally resembles that of GNU <b>gzip</b>, although it is not identical. When
       invoked with filename arguments, <b>ccrypt</b> normally modifies the  files  in  place,  overwriting  their  old
       content. Unlike <b>gzip</b>, the output is not first written to a temporary file; instead, the data is literally
       overwritten.  For encryption, this is usually the desired behavior, since one does not want copies of the
       unencrypted data to remain in hidden places in the file system. The disadvantage is  that  if  <b>ccrypt</b>  is
       interrupted  in the middle of writing to a file, the file will end up in a corrupted, partially encrypted
       state.  However, in such cases it is possible to recover most of  the  data;  see  RECOVERING  DATA  FROM
       CORRUPTED FILES below. If you want to force <b>ccrypt</b> to use temporary files, use the <b>--tmpfiles</b> option.

       When  <b>ccrypt</b>  receives  an  interrupt  signal  (Ctrl-C)  while updating a file in place, it does not exit
       immediately, but rather delays the exit until after it finishes writing to the current file. This  is  to
       prevent  files  from  being partially overwritten and thus corrupted. If you want to force <b>ccrypt</b> to exit
       immediately, just press Ctrl-C twice quickly.

       The encryption algorithm used by <b>ccrypt</b> uses a random seed that is different  each  time.  As  a  result,
       encrypting  the  same  file  twice will never yield the same result. The advantage of this method is that
       similarities in plaintext do not lead to similarities in ciphertext; there is no way of  telling  whether
       the content of two encrypted files is similar or not.

       Because  of the use of a random seed, decrypting and re-encrypting a file with the same key will not lead
       to an identical file. It is primarily for this reason that <b>ccrypt</b> refuses to decrypt files  with  a  non-
       matching  key;  if  this were allowed, there would be no way afterwards to restore the original file, and
       the data would be irretrievably lost.

       When overwriting files, special care is taken with hard links and  symbolic  links.  Each  physical  file
       (i.e.,  each  inode)  is  processed  at  most once, no matter how many paths to it are encountered on the
       command line or in subdirectories traversed recursively. For each file that has multiple  hard  links,  a
       warning  is  printed,  to alert the user that not all paths to the file might have been properly renamed.
       Symbolic links are ignored except in cat mode, or unless the <b>-l</b> or <b>-R</b> option is given.

       Unlike <b>gzip</b>, <b>ccrypt</b> does not complain about files that have improper suffixes.  It  is  legal  to  doubly
       encrypt  a file. It is also legal to decrypt a file that does not have the <b>.cpt</b> suffix, provided the file
       contains valid data for the given decryption key. Use the <b>--strictsuffix</b> option if you  want  to  prevent
       <b>ccrypt</b> from encrypting files that already have a <b>.cpt</b> suffix.

       Regarding encryption and compression: encrypted data is statistically indistinguishable from random data,
       and  thus  it cannot be compressed. But of course it is possible to compress the data first, then encrypt
       it. Suggested file suffixes are <b>.gz.cpt</b> or <b>.gzc</b>.

</pre><h4><b>RECOVERING</b> <b>DATA</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>CORRUPTED</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Encrypted data might be corrupted for a number of reasons. For instance, a file might have been partially
       encrypted or decrypted if <b>ccrypt</b> was interrupted while processing the file. Or data might be corrupted by
       a software or hardware error, or during transmission over a network. The  encryption  algorithm  used  by
       <b>ccrypt</b>  is designed to allow recovery from errors. In general, only a few bytes of data will be lost near
       where the error occurred.

       Data encrypted by <b>ccrypt</b> can be thought of as a sequence of  32-byte  blocks.  To  decrypt  a  particular
       block,  <b>ccrypt</b>  only  needs to know the decryption key, the data of the block itself, and the data of the
       block immediately preceding it. <b>ccrypt</b> cannot tell whether a block is corrupted or not, except  the  very
       first block, which is special. Thus, if the encrypted data has been altered in the middle or near the end
       of  a  file,  <b>ccrypt</b> can be run to decrypt it as usual, and most of the data will be decrypted correctly,
       except near where the corruption occurred.

       The very first block of encrypted data is special,  because  it  does  not  actually  correspond  to  any
       plaintext  data; this block holds the random seed generated at encryption time. <b>ccrypt</b> also uses the very
       first block to decide whether the given keyword matches the data or not. If  the  first  block  has  been
       corrupted, <b>ccrypt</b> will likely decide that the keyword does not match; in such cases, the <b>-m</b> option can be
       used to force <b>ccrypt</b> to decrypt the data anyway.

       If  a  file contains some encrypted and some unencrypted data, or data encrypted with two different keys,
       one should decrypt the entire file with each applicable key, and then piece together the meaningful parts
       manually.

       Finally, decryption will only produce meaningful results if the data is  aligned  correctly  along  block
       boundaries. If the block boundary information has been lost, one has to try all 32 possibilities.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b> <b>OF</b> <b>THE</b> <b>CIPHER</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Block</u>  <u>ciphers</u>  operate on data segments of a fixed length.  For instance, the Rijndael block cipher used
       in <b>ccrypt</b> has a block length of 32 bytes or 256 bits. Thus, this cipher encrypts 32 bytes at a time.

       <u>Stream</u> <u>ciphers</u> operate on data streams of any length. There are several standard modes  for  operating  a
       block  cipher  as  a  stream  cipher. One such standard is <u>Cipher</u> <u>Feedback</u> <u>(CFB)</u>, defined in NIST Special
       Publication 800-38A and ANSI X3.106-1983. <b>ccrypt</b> implements a stream cipher  by  operating  the  Rijndael
       block cipher in CFB mode.

       Let <u>P[i]</u> and <u>C[i]</u> be the <u>i</u>th block of the plaintext and ciphertext, respectively. CFB mode specifies that

              <u>C[i]</u> <u>=</u> <u>P[i]</u> <u>^</u> <u>E(k,C[i-1])</u>

       Here  <u>^</u> denotes the bitwise exclusive or function, and <u>E(k,x)</u> denotes the encryption of the block <u>x</u> under
       the key <u>k</u> using the block cipher. Thus, each block of the ciphertext is calculated from the corresponding
       block of plaintext and the previous block of ciphertext. Note that in fact, each  byte  of  <u>P[i]</u>  can  be
       calculated from the corresponding byte of <u>C[i]</u>, so that the stream cipher can be applied to one byte at a
       time. In particular, the stream length need not be a multiple of the block size.

       Assuming  that  blocks are numbered starting from <u>0</u>, a special "initial" ciphertext block <u>C[-1]</u> is needed
       to provide the base case for the above formula. This value <u>C[-1]</u> is called the <u>initialization</u>  <u>vector</u>  or
       <u>seed</u>. The seed is chosen at encryption time and written as the first block of the encrypted stream. It is
       important  that  the  seed  is unpredictable; in particular, the same seed should never by used more than
       once.  Otherwise, the two resulting ciphertext blocks <u>C[0]</u> could be related by a  simple  xor  to  obtain
       information  about  the  corresponding  plaintext  blocks  <u>P[0]</u>.  If unpredictable seeds are used, CFB is
       provably as secure as the underlying block cipher.

       In <b>ccrypt</b>, the seed is constructed as follows: first, a nonce is constructed by hashing a combination  of
       the  host  name,  current  time,  process  id,  and  an  internal  counter  into a 28-byte value, using a
       cryptographic hash function. The nonce is combined  with  a  fixed  four-byte  "magic  number",  and  the
       resulting  32-byte  value is encrypted by one round of the Rijndael block cipher with the given key. This
       encrypted block is used as the seed and appended to the beginning of the ciphertext. The use of the magic
       number allows <b>ccrypt</b> to detect non-matching keys before decryption.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ccrypt</b> is believed to provide very strong cryptographic security, equivalent  to  that  of  the  Rijndael
       cipher  with  256-bit  block  size  and  256-bit key size. Another version of the Rijndael cipher (with a
       smaller  block  size)  is  used  in  the  U.S.  government's  Advanced  Encryption  Standard  (AES,   see
       <a href="http://www.nist.gov/aes">http://www.nist.gov/aes</a>).  Therefore,  this  cipher  is very well studied and subject to intensive public
       scrutiny.  This scrutiny has a positive effect on the cipher's security. In particular, if an exploitable
       weakness in this cipher were ever discovered, this would become widely publicized.

       In practical terms, the security of <b>ccrypt</b> means that, without knowledge of the  encryption  key,  it  is
       effectively  impossible  to  obtain  any information about the plaintext from a given ciphertext. This is
       true even if a large number of plaintext-ciphertext pairs are already known for the same  key.  Moreover,
       because  <b>ccrypt</b>  uses  a  key size of 256 bits, an exhaustive search of the key space is not feasible, at
       least as long as sufficiently long and hard-to-guess keys are actually used in  practice.  No  cipher  is
       secure if users choose insecure keywords.

       On the other hand, <b>ccrypt</b> does not attempt to provide <u>data</u> <u>integrity</u>, i.e., it will not attempt to detect
       whether  the  ciphertext  was  modified after encryption. In particular, encrypted data can be truncated,
       leaving the corresponding decrypted data also truncated, but otherwise consistent. If one needs to ensure
       data integrity as well as secrecy, this can be achieved by other methods. The recommended  method  is  to
       prepend a cryptographic hash (for instance, an SHA-1 hash) to the data before encryption.

       <b>ccrypt</b>  does  not  claim  to  provide any particular safeguards against information leaking via the local
       operating system. While reasonable precautions are  taken,  there  is  no  guarantee  that  keywords  and
       plaintexts  have  been  physically  erased  after encryption in completed; parts of such data might still
       exist in memory or on disk. <b>ccrypt</b> does not currently use privileged memory pages.

       When encrypting files, <b>ccrypt</b> by default accesses them in  read-write  mode.  This  normally  causes  the
       original file to be physically overwritten, but on some file systems, this might not be the case.

       Note  that  the  use of the <b>-K</b> option is unsafe in a multiuser environment, because the command line of a
       process is visible to other users running the <b>ps</b> command. The use of the <b>-E</b> option is potentially  unsafe
       for  the  same  reason,  although  recent versions of <b>ps</b> don't tend to display environment information to
       other users.  The use of the <b>-T</b> option is unsafe for  encryption  because  the  original  plaintext  will
       remain in unused sectors of the file system.

</pre><h4><b>EMACS</b> <b>PACKAGE</b></h4><pre>
       There  is  an  emacs  package for reading and writing encrypted files.  (Note that this package currently
       only works with emacs, not with xemacs.)  This package hooks into the low-level  file  I/O  functions  of
       emacs,  prompting  the  user  for a password where appropriate. It is implemented in much the same way as
       support for compressed files. If you have both the ps-ccrypt and jka-compr packages installed, emacs  can
       open  encrypted  files  and  compressed  files;  however,  it  does not currently work for files that are
       encrypted and compressed.

       To use the package, simply load ps-ccrypt, then edit as usual.  When you open  a  file  with  the  ".cpt"
       extension,  emacs  will  prompt  you  for  a password for the file. It will remember the password for the
       buffer, and when you save the file later, it will be automatically encrypted again (provided you save  it
       with  a  ".cpt"  extension).  Except  for  the  password  prompt,  the operation of the package should be
       transparent to the user. The command M-x ccrypt-set-buffer-password can be used  to  change  the  current
       password of a buffer.

       The simplest way to use this package is to include the lines

              (setq load-path (cons "<u>path</u>" load-path))
              (require 'ps-ccrypt "ps-ccrypt.el")

       in your .emacs file, where <u>path</u> is the directory that holds the file ps-ccrypt.el.

       Limitations  of  the emacs package: there is no guarantee that unencrypted information cannot leak to the
       file system; in fact, the package sometimes writes unencrypted data to temporary  files.  However,  auto-
       saved  files are normally treated correctly (i.e., encrypted).  For details, see the comments in the file
       ps-ccrypt.el.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The exit status is 0 on successful completion, and non-zero otherwise.  An exit status of 1 means illegal
       command line, 2 is out of memory or another system error, 3 is a fatal i/o error, 4 is a non-matching key
       or wrong file format, 6 is interrupt, 7 is mistyped key in <b>--timid</b> mode, 8 is a non-fatal i/o error,  and
       9 means that no key was obtained because the user failed to enter it, or because the specified keyfile or
       environment  variable  could  not  be  read.  An  exit  status of 10 means that the file specified by the
       <b>--keyref</b> option could not be read, or did not match the requested encryption key.

       Fatal i/o errors are those that occur while processing a file that is already  open.  Such  errors  cause
       ccrypt  to  abort its operation immediately with an exit status of 3. Non-fatal i/o errors are those that
       occur while handling files that are not already open; typically, such errors are caused by files that are
       missing, not readable, or can't be created.  When encountering  a  non-fatal  i/o  error,  ccrypt  simply
       continues  to  process the next available input file. The exit status of 8 is delayed until after all the
       files have been processed.

       Non-matching keys and wrong file formats are also  considered  non-fatal  errors,  and  cause  ccrypt  to
       continue  with processing the next available input file. In this case, an exit status of 4 is given after
       all the files have been processed. If there is a conflict  between  exit  status  4  and  8,  then  8  is
       returned.

       The  former exit status 5 ("wrong file format") has been eliminated, and is now covered under exit status
       4 ("non-matching key or wrong file format"). Note that ccrypt does not really have a "file format" in the
       proper sense of the word; any file of length at least 32 bytes is potentially a valid encrypted file.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Like all encryption programs that depend on a user-supplied key, the encryption is only as strong as  the
       key  you provide. You must assume that adversaries have the ability to try billions of different keys per
       second, or more. So if you use a key that is too short, or a key that is long  but  easy  to  guess,  you
       should assume that it can and will be broken.

       While <b>ccrypt</b> can handle keywords of arbitrary length, some operating systems limit the length of an input
       line to 1024 characters.

       The  renaming of files (adding or removing the <b>.cpt</b> suffix) can go wrong if a filename is repeated on the
       command line.  In this case, the file is only encrypted/decrypted once, but the suffix may  be  added  or
       removed  several  times.  This  is  because <b>ccrypt</b> thinks it encountered different hardlinks for the same
       file.

       The <b>--strictsuffix</b> option can behave in unexpected ways if one file has several hardlinks, some of  which
       have  the  suffix  and  some of which don't. In this case, the inode will be encrypted/decrypted, but the
       suffix will be changed only for those filenames that allow it. Similarly, if a  file  cannot  be  renamed
       because  a  file  of  the  given name already exists, the file may still be encrypted/decrypted if it has
       another hardlink.
