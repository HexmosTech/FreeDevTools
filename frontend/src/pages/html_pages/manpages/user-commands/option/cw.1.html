</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cw - sound characters as Morse code on the soundcard or console speaker

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cw</b>   [-s --system=<u>SYSTEM</u>]   [-d --device=<u>DEVICE</u>]   [-w --wpm=<u>WPM</u>]   [-t --tone=<u>HZ</u>]  [-v --volume=<u>PERCENT</u>]
       [-g --gap=<u>GAP</u>]     [-k --weighting=<u>WEIGHT</u>]     [-e --noecho]     [-m --nomessages]      [-c --nocommands]
       [-o --nocombinations] [-p --nocomments] [-f --infile=<u>FILE</u>] [-h --help] [-V --version]

       <b>cw</b>  installed  on  GNU/Linux  systems understands both short form and long form command line options.  <b>cw</b>
       installed on other operating systems may understand only the short form options.

       There are no mandatory options.

       Options may be predefined in the environment variable <b>CW_OPTIONS</b>.  If defined,  these  options  are  used
       first; command line options take precedence.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cw</b>  reads characters from an input file, or from standard input, and sounds each valid character as Morse
       code on either the system sound card, or the system console speaker.  After it  sounds  a  character,  <b>cw</b>
       echoes  it  to standard output.  The input stream can contain embedded command strings.  These change the
       parameters used when sounding the Morse code.  <b>cw</b> reports any errors in  embedded  commands  on  standard
       error.

       Use 'Ctrl+D' key combination to exit <b>cw</b>.

   <b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>cw</b>  understands  the  following command line options.  The long form options may not be available in non-
       LINUX versions.

       <u>-s,</u> <u>--system=SYSTEM</u>
              Specifies the way that <b>cw</b> generates tones.  Valid values are: <u>null</u> for  no  tones,  just  timings,
              <u>console</u>  for  tones through the console speaker, <u>alsa</u> for tones generated through the system sound
              card using ALSA sound system, <u>oss</u> for tones generated through system sound card  using  OSS  sound
              system,  <u>pulseaudio</u>  for  tones generated through system sound card using PulseAudio sound system,
              <u>soundcard</u> for tones generated through the system sound card, but  without  explicit  selection  of
              sound  system. These values can be shortened to 'n', 'c', 'a', 'o', 'p', or 's', respectively. The
              default value is 'pulseaudio' (on systems with PulseAudio installed), followed by 'oss'.

       <u>-d,</u> <u>--device=DEVICE</u>
              Specifies the device file to open for generating a sound.  <b>cw</b> will use default device if  none  is
              specified.  The  default devices are: <u>/dev/console</u> for sound produced through console, <u>default</u> for
              ALSA sound system, <u>/dev/audio</u> for OSS sound system, <u>a</u> <u>default</u> <u>device</u> for PulseAudio sound  system.
              See also <u>NOTES</u> <u>ON</u> <u>USING</u> <u>A</u> <u>SOUND</u> <u>CARD</u> below.

       <u>-w,</u> <u>--wpm=WPM</u>
              Sets  the  initial  sending  speed  in words per minute.  The value must be between 4 and 60.  The
              default value is 12 WPM.

       <u>-t,</u> <u>--tone=HZ</u>
              Sets the initial sounder pitch in Hz.  This value must be between 0  and  4,000.   A  value  of  0
              selects  silent  operation, and can be used for timing checks or other testing.  The default value
              is 800Hz,

       <u>-v,</u> <u>--volume=PERCENT</u>
              Sets the initial sending volume, as a percentage of full scale volume.  The value must be  between
              0  and  100.   The  default  value is 70 %.  Sound volumes work fully for sound card tones, but <b>cw</b>
              cannot control the volume of tones from the console speaker.  In this case, a volume  of  zero  is
              silent, and all other volume values are simply sounded.

       <u>-g,</u> <u>--gap=GAP</u>
              Sets  the initial extra gap, in dot lengths, between characters (the 'Farnsworth' delay).  It must
              be between 0 and 60.  The default is 0.

       <u>-k,</u> <u>--weighting=WEIGHT</u>
              Sets the initial weighting, as a percentage of dot lengths.  It must be between 20  and  80.   The
              default is 50.

       <u>-e,</u> <u>--noecho</u>
              Stops  <b>cw</b>  echoing  characters  on standard output after they are sounded.  The default is to have
              echoing on.

       <u>-m,</u> <u>--nomessages</u>
              Stops <b>cw</b> printing error messages on standard error.  The default is to print messages.

       <u>-c,</u> <u>--nocommands</u>
              Stops <b>cw</b> from interpreting commands embedded in the input stream.  The  default  is  to  interpret
              embedded commands.

       <u>-o,</u> <u>--nocombinations</u>
              Stops  <b>cw</b>  from  treating  character strings bracketed by [...] as a single combination character.
              The default is to honor combinations.

       <u>-p,</u> <u>--nocomments</u>
              Stops <b>cw</b> from treating character strings bracketed by  {...}  as  'comments'.   Characters  inside
              these braces will be echoed to standard output, but not sounded.  When comments are being honored,
              any embedded commands inside the braces will be ignored.  The default is to honor comments.

       <u>-f,</u> <u>--infile=FILE</u>
              Specifies a text file that <b>cw</b> can read to configure its practice text.

       <u>-h,</u> <u>--help</u>
              Prints short help message.

       <u>-V,</u> <u>--version</u>
              Prints information about program's version, authors and license.

   <b>SOUNDING</b> <b>CHARACTERS</b>
       <b>cw</b>  reads  characters,  one at a time, from its standard input or from its input file.  Lowercase letters
       are converted internally to uppercase. The following list shows the valid IS0 8859-1 (Latin-1) characters
       that can be sounded by <b>cw</b>:

              ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789"$()+-./:;=?_@ and space

       In addition, the program also understands the following ISO 8859-1 and ISO 8859-2 accented characters:

              ÜÄÇÖÉÈÀÑŞ (S with cedilla), Ž (Z with caron/hacek),

       and accepts the following as single character forms of common procedural signals:

              &lt;&gt;!&amp;^~

       See <b>cw</b>(7,LOCAL) for more information on the above characters and Morse code.

       If <b>cw</b> receives a character not in this set, it prints an  error  message  '?<u>c</u>',  where  <u>c</u>  is  the  error
       character.  The only exceptions to this may be the <b>cw</b> command escape character '%', the combination start
       and  stop  characters  '['  and ']', and the comment start and stop characters '{' and '}'.  See <u>EMBEDDED</u>
       <u>COMMANDS</u> and <u>MORSE</u> <u>CODE</u> <u>COMBINATIONS</u> below.

   <b>EMBEDDED</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       <b>cw</b> recognizes special sequences in the input stream as  embedded  commands.   These  commands  alter  the
       parameters  of  the  <b>cw</b>  while  it is running, or query current values.  All commands are prefixed by the
       command escape character '%', and those which set a value end with a semicolon.

       The format of an embedded command to change a parameter value is

              %<u>Cvalue</u>;

       where <u>C</u> is a command letter indicating what action <b>cw</b> is to take, and <u>value</u> is the argument or value  for
       the command.

       Valid command letters are

       <u>T</u>      Sets the tone pitch used to sound a character.

       <u>W</u>      Sets the sending speed.

       <u>G</u>      Sets the 'Farnsworth' gap between characters.

       <u>K</u>      Sets the weighting.

       <u>E</u>      Disables or re-enables echoing of sent characters on standard output.

       <u>M</u>      Disables or re-enables error messages on standard error.

       <u>S</u>      Disables or re-enables speaker tone generation.

       <u>C</u>      Disables  processing of embedded commands.  Note that once disabled, this command cannot re-enable
              them.

       <u>O</u>      Disables or re-enables recognition of [...] character combinations.

       <u>P</u>      Disables or re-enables recognition of {...} comments.  When comments  are  being  recognized,  any
              character  after  an opening '{' and before any closing '}' will be echoed to standard output, but
              will not be sounded, or have any other effect.

       For example, the embedded command sequence

              %W25;%T1200;

       will set <b>cw</b> to a speed of 25 WPM, and a tone pitch of 1200Hz.

       The 'T', 'W', 'G', and 'A' commands take values along with the command.  The limits on values  given  for
       embedded commands are the same as the limits available for command line options, detailed above.

       The  'E',  'M',  'S',  'C'  and 'O' commands are flags, and treat a value of zero as clear, and any other
       value as set.  So, for example, the sequence

              %M0;%C0;

       will turn off error messages, and then turn off the processing of embedded commands.

       If a parameter is set successfully, <b>cw</b> reports the new setting on standard  error  (except  if  no  error
       messages  is set).  If an error is detected in an embedded command, <b>cw</b> reports an error.  For the formats
       of error messages see the <u>MESSAGE</u> <u>FORMATS</u> section below.

       The current values of parameters within <b>cw</b> may be queried, as well as set.  The command format

              %?<u>C</u>

       queries the value of the parameter normally set with command <u>C</u>.  <b>cw</b> reports the current value on standard
       error, using the same format as when new values are set.

       The current values of parameters within <b>cw</b> may also be requested as output in Morse  code.   The  command
       format

              %&gt;<u>C</u>

       will generate Morse output reporting the value of the parameter normally set with command <u>C</u>.

       If  embedded commands are disabled, '%' characters are treated as any other (in this case, invalid) input
       character.

       Once processing of embedded commands has been switched off, any command to switch this  feature  back  on
       will not be recognized.  That is, after '%C0;', an '%C1;' will not be recognized.

       There is one additional command, and that is '%Q'.  This command closes all open files and terminates <b>cw</b>.
       Any characters after this command in the input stream will be lost.

       The  file  <u>cw.h</u> provides a full set of definitions for the commands, special characters, and status codes
       of <b>cw</b>.

   <b>MESSAGE</b> <b>FORMATS</b>
       Where a parameter value is set correctly with an embedded command, the message format

              =<u>Cvalue</u>

       is returned.  <u>C</u> is the command used, and <u>value</u> is the new value.

       If an invalid value is supplied for a parameter in an embedded command, a message

              ?<u>Cvalue</u>

       is returned.

       Where an invalid command is encountered, the message format

              ?%<u>C</u>

       is used.  For an invalid query, the message is

              ??<u>C</u>

       and for an invalid request for a parameter in Morse code the message is

              ?&gt;<u>C</u>

       A character in the input stream that cannot be sounded produces a message

              ?<u>C</u>

       These messages are not intended  to  be  user-friendly,  but  are  designed  to  be  easily  and  quickly
       interpreted  by  another  program.   Similarly, the format of embedded commands is more computer-friendly
       than user-friendly.

       If error messages are disabled, no messages of any type are printed on standard error.

   <b>MORSE</b> <b>CODE</b> <b>COMBINATIONS</b>
       The standard set of characters offered by <b>cw</b> may not be sufficient for some purposes.  For example,  some
       international characters do not have equivalent ISO 8859-1 and ISO 8859-2 that <b>cw</b> can sound directly.

       To  help  in  sounding  such  characters, <b>cw</b> offers the ability to form combination characters by placing
       individual character components between [...]  brackets.   <b>Cw</b>  sounds  characters  inside  a  combination
       without the usual gap between them.  In this way, any missing character in the set can be built.

       For example

              [VA]

       is one way to form the VA procedural signal, though

              [SK]

       works just as well.  The eight-dot error signal can be sounded with

              [HSE]

       or the C-cedilla in international Morse code with

              [CE]

       There  can  be  as  many  valid letters, numbers, or figures inside the [...]  brackets as required.  For
       example, an alternative way of sending the error signal could be

              [EEEEEEEE]

       Finally, three alternative ways of sending 73 might be

              [TTEEE][EEETT]
              [TDE][EUT]
              [GEE][VT]

       Embedded commands may be placed inside [...] combinations if required.  Combinations do not nest.

       This feature can be disabled by using the <u>-O</u> or <u>--nocombinations</u> command line  flags,  or  with  the  'O'
       embedded  command.   If  combinations  are  disabled,  '['  and  ']'  characters are treated as any other
       (invalid) input character.

   <b>NOTES</b> <b>ON</b> <b>USING</b> <b>A</b> <b>SOUND</b> <b>CARD</b>
       By default, <b>cw</b> tries to open default PulseAudio. If PulseAudio server is not accessible, cw tries to open
       OSS device "/dev/audio" to access the system sound card.  This is generally the correct  device  to  use,
       but for systems with special requirements, or those with multiple sound cards, the option <u>-d</u> or <u>--device</u>,
       combined  with  <u>-s</u>  or <u>--system</u> can be used to specify the device and sound system for sound card access.
       If the sound card device cannot be set up, <b>cw</b> prints the error message

              cannot set up soundcard sound

       and exits.

       Sound card devices, when opened through OSS sound system, are usually single-access devices, so that when
       one process has opened the device, other processes are prevented from using it. In such cases <b>cw</b> will  of
       course  conflict with any other programs that expect exclusive use of the system sound card (for example,
       MP3 players).  If <b>cw</b> finds that the sound card is already busy, it prints the error message

              open /dev/audio: Device or resource busy

       and exits.

       The sound card device is not used if <b>cw</b> is only sending tones on the console speaker.

   <b>Sound</b> <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>-</b> <b>DEFAULTS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SELECTION</b>
       <b>cw</b> first tries to access sound card using PulseAudio sound system, using default device name, unless user
       specifies other sound device with option <u>-d</u> or <u>--device</u>.

       <b>cw</b> then tries  to  access  sound  card  using  OSS  sound  system  and  default  OSS  sound  device  name
       ('/dev/audio'), unless user specifies other sound device with option <u>-d</u> or <u>--device</u>.

       If  opening  soundcard  through OSS fails, <b>cw</b> tries to access the sound card using ALSA sound system, and
       default ALSA sound device name ('default'), unless user specifies other sound device with  option  <u>-d</u>  or
       <u>--device</u>.

       If  opening  soundcard  through  ALSA  also fails, <b>cw</b> tries to access system console buzzer using default
       buzzer device '/dev/console', unless user specifies other sound device with option <u>-d</u> or <u>--device</u>.

       It is very common that in order to access the console buzzer device user has  to  have  root  privileges.
       For  that reason trying to open console buzzer almost always fails.  This is not a program's bug, this is
       a result of operating system's restrictions.  Making <b>cw</b> an suid binary bypasses  this  restriction.   The
       program  does  not fork() or exec(), so making it suid should be relatively safe.  Note however that this
       practice is discouraged for security reasons.

       As stated, user can tell <b>cw</b> which device to use, using <u>-d</u> or <u>--device</u> option.   Which  device  files  are
       suitable  will  depend on which operating system is running, which system user ID runs <b>cw</b>, and which user
       groups user belongs to.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Despite the fact that this manual page constantly and consistently refers to Morse code elements as  dots
       and  dashes, DO NOT think in these terms when trying to learn Morse code.  Always think of them as 'dit's
       and 'dah's.

       The Morse code table in the <b>cw</b>(7,LOCAL) man page is provided for reference only.   If  learning  for  the
       first  time,  you will be much better off learning by hearing the characters sent, rather than by looking
       at the table.

       Other programs running in the system may interfere with the timing of the Morse code that <b>cw</b> is  sending.
       If this is a problem, either try to run on a quiescent system, or try running <b>cw</b> with nice(1L,C,1).  UNIX
       is not really designed for user-level programs to do the sort of fine timing required to send Morse code.
       <b>cw</b> is therefore more sensitive than most programs to other system activity.

       <b>cw</b>  uses  system  itimers  for  its internal timing.  On most UNIX flavors, itimers are not guaranteed to
       signal a program exactly at the specified time, and they generally offer a resolution only as good as the
       normal system 'clock tick' resolution.  An itimer SIGALRM usually falls on a system clock tick, making it
       accurate to no better than 10mS on a typical 100Hz kernel.

       The effect of this is that an itimer period is generally either exactly as specified,  or,  more  likely,
       slightly  longer.  At higher WPM settings, the cumulative effect of this affects timing accuracy, because
       at higher speeds, there are fewer 10mS clock ticks in a dot period.  For example,  at  12  WPM,  the  dot
       length  is  100mS,  enough to contain five kernel clock ticks.  But at 60 WPM, the dot length is 20mS, or
       just two kernel clock ticks.  So at  higher  speeds,  the  effect  of  itimer  resolutions  becomes  more
       pronounced.

       To test itimer timing, first try

              X="PARIS PARIS PARIS PARIS "

              echo "$X" | time cw -w 4

       and note the elapsed time, which should be very close to one minute.  Next, try

              echo "$X$X$X$X$X$X$X$X$X$X$X$X" | time cw -w 48

       The  elapsed time should be the same.  If it has increased, this is the effect of system itimers delaying
       for slightly longer than the specified period (higher WPM rates make more itimer calls).  That's  itimers
       for  you,  not  perfect  for  this job, but the best there is without writing some, and perhaps a lot of,
       kernel code.

       Except for zero, which is silent, tone values lower than 10Hz may not sound at the expected pitch.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Send a string of characters at 25 WPM, 700Hz, with no extra gaps:

              echo "UNIX CW SOUNDER" | cw -w 25 -t 700

       Send a string at varying speeds and tones on the console speaker, specifying a system console device:

              echo "%W12;%T400;400HZ 12WPM %W25;%T1500;1500HZ 25WPM" | cw -m -sc -d /dev/tty2

       Send C-cedilla, VA, and a report of the WPM setting, with extra spacing at half volume:

              echo "[CE] [VA] %&gt;W" | cw -g 10 -v 50

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>OMISSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Cut numbers are not provided, though they can be emulated, up to a point, by pre-filtering.

       An output to an optional external device, for example, keying a line on the parallel port,  or  a  serial
       line, might also be useful.
