</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       hbal is a cluster balancer that looks at the current state of the cluster (nodes  with  their  total  and
       free  disk,  memory,  etc.)   and instance placement and computes a series of steps designed to bring the
       cluster into a better state.

       The algorithm used is designed to be stable (i.e.  it will give you the same results when  restarting  it
       from  the  middle  of  the  solution)  and reasonably fast.  It is not, however, designed to be a perfect
       algorithm: it is possible to make it go into a corner from which it can find no improvement,  because  it
       looks only one "step" ahead.

       The program accesses the cluster state via Rapi or Luxi.  It also requests data over the network from all
       MonDs with the --mond option.  Currently it uses only data produced by CPUload collector.

       By  default,  the  program  will show the solution incrementally as it is computed, in a somewhat cryptic
       format; for getting the actual Ganeti command list, use the <b>-C</b> option.

   <b>ALGORITHM</b>
       The program works in independent steps; at each step, we compute the best instance move that  lowers  the
       cluster score.

       The  possible  move type for an instance are combinations of failover/migrate and replace-disks such that
       we change one of the instance nodes, and the other one remains (but  possibly  with  changed  role,  e.g.
       from primary it becomes secondary).  The list is:

       • failover (f)

       • replace secondary (r)

       • replace primary, a composite move (f, r, f)

       • failover and replace secondary, also composite (f, r)

       • replace secondary and failover, also composite (r, f)

       We  don't  do  the only remaining possibility of replacing both nodes (r,f,r,f or the equivalent f,r,f,r)
       since these move needs an exhaustive search over both candidate  primary  and  secondary  nodes,  and  is
       O(n*n)  in  the  number of nodes.  Furthermore, it doesn't seems to give better scores but will result in
       more disk replacements.

   <b>PLACEMENT</b> <b>RESTRICTIONS</b>
       At each step, we prevent an instance move if it would cause:

       • a node to go into N+1 failure state

       • an instance to move onto an offline node (offline nodes are either read from the  cluster  or  declared
         with <u>-O</u>; drained nodes are considered offline)

       • an  exclusion-tag  based  conflict  (exclusion  tags  are  read from the cluster and/or defined via the
         <u>--exclusion-tags</u> option)

       • a max vcpu/pcpu ratio to be exceeded (configured via <u>--max-cpu</u>)

       • min disk free percentage to go below the configured limit (configured via <u>--min-disk</u>)

   <b>CLUSTER</b> <b>SCORING</b>
       As said before, the algorithm tries to minimise the cluster score at each step.  Currently this score  is
       computed as a weighted sum of the following components:

       • standard deviation of the percent of free memory

       • standard deviation of the percent of reserved memory

       • the sum of the percentages of reserved memory

       • standard deviation of the percent of free disk

       • count of nodes failing N+1 check

       • count  of instances living (either as primary or secondary) on offline nodes; in the sense of hbal (and
         the other htools) drained nodes are considered offline

       • count of instances living (as primary) on offline nodes; this differs from the above metric by  helping
         failover of such instances in 2-node clusters

       • standard deviation of the ratio of virtual-to-physical cpus (for primary instances of the node)

       • standard  deviation  of  the  fraction of the available spindles (in dedicated mode, spindles represent
         physical spindles; otherwise this oversubscribable measure for IO load, and the oversubscription factor
         is taken into account when computing the number of available spindles)

       • standard deviation of the dynamic load on the nodes, for cpus, memory, disk and network

       • standard deviation of the CPU load provided by MonD

       • the count of instances with primary and secondary in the same failure domain

       • the count of instances sharing the same exclusion tags which  primary  instances  placed  in  the  same
         failure domain

       • the overall sum of dissatisfied desired locations among all cluster instances

       The  free  memory and free disk values help ensure that all nodes are somewhat balanced in their resource
       usage.  The reserved memory helps to ensure  that  nodes  are  somewhat  balanced  in  holding  secondary
       instances,  and  that  no  node  keeps too much memory reserved for N+1.  And finally, the N+1 percentage
       helps guide the algorithm towards eliminating N+1 failures, if possible.

       Except for the N+1 failures, offline instances  counts,  failure  domain  violation  counts  and  desired
       locations  count,  we use the standard deviation since when used with values within a fixed range (we use
       percents expressed as values between zero and one) it gives consistent results across all metrics  (there
       are  some small issues related to different means, but it works generally well).  The 'count' type values
       will have higher score and thus  will  matter  more  for  balancing;  thus  these  are  better  for  hard
       constraints  (like  evacuating  nodes and fixing N+1 failures).  For example, the offline instances count
       (i.e.  the number of instances living on offline  nodes)  will  cause  the  algorithm  to  actively  move
       instances  away  from  offline  nodes.   This, coupled with the restriction on placement given by offline
       nodes, will cause evacuation of such nodes.

       The dynamic load values need to be read from an external file  (Ganeti  doesn't  supply  them),  and  are
       computed  for each node as: sum of primary instance cpu load, sum of primary instance memory load, sum of
       primary and secondary instance disk load (as DRBD generates write load on secondary nodes too  in  normal
       case  and in degraded scenarios also read load), and sum of primary instance network load.  An example of
       how to generate these values for input to hbal would be to track xl list for instances over a day and  by
       computing  the  delta  of the cpu values, and feed that via the <u>-U</u> option for all instances (and keep the
       other metrics as one).  For the algorithm to work, all that is needed is that the values  are  consistent
       for  a  metric  across all instances (e.g.  all instances use cpu% to report cpu usage, and not something
       related to number of CPU seconds used if the CPUs are different), and that they are normalised to between
       zero and one.  Note that it's recommended to not have zero as the load  value  for  any  instance  metric
       since then secondary instances are not well balanced.

       The  CPUload  from  MonD's  data collector will be used only if all MonDs are running, otherwise it won't
       affect the cluster score.  Since we can't find the CPU load of each instance, we can assume that the  CPU
       load  of  an  instance  is  proportional to the number of its vcpus.  With this heuristic, instances from
       nodes with high CPU load will tend to move to nodes with less CPU load.

       On a perfectly balanced cluster (all nodes the same size, all instances the same size and  spread  across
       the  nodes  equally, all desired locations satisfied), the values for all metrics would be zero, with the
       exception of the total percentage of reserved memory.  This doesn't happen too often in practice :)

   <b>OFFLINE</b> <b>INSTANCES</b>
       Since current Ganeti versions do not report the memory used by offline (down) instances, ignoring the run
       status of instances will cause wrong calculations.  For this reason, the algorithm subtracts  the  memory
       size  of down instances from the free node memory of their primary node, in effect simulating the startup
       of such instances.

   <b>DESIRED</b> <b>LOCATION</b> <b>TAGS</b>
       Sometimes, administrators  want  specific  instances  located  in  a  particular,  typically  geographic,
       location.  To support this desired location tags are introduced.

       If  the  cluster  is tagged <u>htools:desiredlocation:x</u> then tags starting with <u>x</u> are desired location tags.
       Instances can be assigned tags of the form <u>x</u> that means that instance wants to be placed on a node tagged
       with a location tag <u>x</u>.  (That means that cluster should be tagged <u>htools:nlocation:x</u> too).

       Instance pinning is just heuristics, not a hard enforced requirement; it will only  be  achieved  by  the
       cluster metrics favouring such placements.

   <b>EXCLUSION</b> <b>TAGS</b>
       The  exclusion tags mechanism is designed to prevent instances which run the same workload (e.g.  two DNS
       servers) to land on the same node, which would make the respective node a SPOF for the given service.

       It works by tagging instances with certain tags and then building exclusion maps based on  these.   Which
       tags  are actually used is configured either via the command line (option <u>--exclusion-tags</u>) or via adding
       them to the cluster tags:

       --exclusion-tags=a,b
              This will make all instance tags of the form <u>a:*</u>, <u>b:*</u> be considered for the exclusion map

       cluster tags <u>htools:iextags:a</u>, <u>htools:iextags:b</u>
              This will make instance tags <u>a:*</u>, <u>b:*</u> be considered for the exclusion map.   More  precisely,  the
              suffix of cluster tags starting with <u>htools:iextags:</u> will become the prefix of the exclusion tags.

       Both  the above forms mean that two instances both having (e.g.)  the tag <u>a:foo</u> or <u>b:bar</u> won't end on the
       same node.

   <b>MIGRATION</b> <b>TAGS</b>
       If Ganeti is deployed on a heterogeneous cluster, migration might not be possible between all nodes of  a
       node  group.   One  example  of  such a situation is upgrading the hypervisor node by node.  To make hbal
       aware of those restrictions, the following cluster tags are used.

       cluster tags <u>htools:migration:a</u>, <u>htools:migration:b</u>, etc
              This make make node tags of the form <u>a:*</u>, <u>b:*</u>, etc  be  considered  migration  restriction.   More
              precisely,  the  suffix  of cluster tags starting with <u>htools:migration:</u> will become the prefix of
              the migration tags.  Only those migrations will be taken into consideration  where  all  migration
              tags of the source node are also present on the target node.

       cluster tags <u>htools:allowmigration:x::y</u> for migration tags <u>x</u> and <u>y</u>
              This asserts that a node tagged <u>y</u> is able to receive instances in the same way as if they had an <u>x</u>
              tag.

       So  in  the  simple  case  of  a hypervisor upgrade, tagging all the nodes that have been upgraded with a
       migration tag suffices.  In more complicated situations,  it  is  always  possible  to  use  a  different
       migration  tag for each hypervisor used and explicitly state the allowed migration directions by means of
       <u>htools:allowmigration:</u> tags.

   <b>LOCATION</b> <b>TAGS</b>
       Within a node group, certain nodes might be more likely to fail simultaneously due to a common  cause  of
       error  (e.g., if they share the same power supply unit).  Ganeti can be made aware of those common causes
       of failure by means of tags.

       cluster tags <u>htools:nlocation:a</u>, <u>htools:nlocation:b</u>, etc
              This make node tags of the form <u>a:*</u>, <u>b:*</u>, etc be considered to have a common cause of failure.

       Instances with primary and secondary node having a common cause of failure and instances sharing the same
       exclusion tag with primary nodes having a  common  failure  are  considered  badly  placed.   While  such
       placements are always allowed, they count heavily towards the cluster score.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The options that can be passed to the program are as follows:

       -C, --print-commands
              Print the command list at the end of the run.  Without this, the program will only show a shorter,
              but cryptic output.

              Note  that  the  moves  list  will be split into independent steps, called "jobsets", but only for
              visual inspection, not for actually parallelisation.  It is  not  possible  to  parallelise  these
              directly  when  executed via "gnt-instance" commands, since a compound command (e.g.  failover and
              replace-disks) must be executed serially.  Parallel execution is only possible when using the Luxi
              backend and the <u>-L</u> option.

              The algorithm for splitting the moves into jobsets is by accumulating moves until the next move is
              touching nodes already touched by the current moves; this means we can't execute in parallel  (due
              to resource allocation in Ganeti) and thus we start a new jobset.

       -p, --print-nodes
              Prints  the before and after node status, in a format designed to allow the user to understand the
              node's most important parameters.  See the man page <b><a href="../man1/htools.1.html">htools</a></b>(1) for more details about this option.

       --print-instances
              Prints the before and after instance map.  This is less useful as the node status, but it can help
              in understanding instance moves.

       -O <u>name</u>
              This option (which can be given multiple times) will mark nodes as being <u>offline</u>.   This  means  a
              couple of things:

              • instances  won't  be placed on these nodes, not even temporarily; e.g.  the <u>replace</u> <u>primary</u> move
                is not available if the secondary node is offline, since this move requires a failover.

              • these nodes will not be included  in  the  score  calculation  (except  for  the  percentage  of
                instances on offline nodes)

              Note  that  algorithm  will  also mark as offline any nodes which are reported by RAPI as such, or
              that have "?" in file-based input in any numeric fields.

       -e <u>score</u>, --min-score=*score*
              This parameter denotes how much above the N+1 bound the cluster score can for us to be happy  with
              and alters the computation in two ways:

              • if the cluster has the initial score lower than this value, then we don't enter the algorithm at
                all, and exit with success

              • during the iterative process, if we reach a score lower than this value, we exit the algorithm

              The default value of the parameter is currently 1e-9 (chosen empirically).

       -g <u>delta</u>, --min-gain=*delta*
              Since the balancing algorithm can sometimes result in just very tiny improvements, that bring less
              gain that they cost in relocation time, this parameter (defaulting to 0.01) represents the minimum
              gain we require during a step, to continue balancing.

       --min-gain-limit=*threshold*
              The  above  min-gain  option will only take effect if the cluster score is already below <u>threshold</u>
              (defaults to 0.1).  The rationale behind this setting  is  that  at  high  cluster  scores  (badly
              balanced  clusters),  we don't want to abort the rebalance too quickly, as later gains might still
              be significant.  However, under the threshold, the total gain is only the threshold value,  so  we
              can exit early.

       --no-disk-moves
              This parameter prevents hbal from using disk move (i.e.  "gnt-instance replace-disks") operations.
              This  will  result in a much quicker balancing, but of course the improvements are limited.  It is
              up to the user to decide when to use one or another.

       --no-instance-moves
              This parameter prevents hbal from using instance  moves  (i.e.   "gnt-instance  migrate/failover")
              operations.   This  will  only  use  the slow disk-replacement operations, and will also provide a
              worse balance, but can be useful if moving instances around is deemed unsafe or not preferred.

       --evac-mode
              This parameter restricts the list of instances  considered  for  moving  to  the  ones  living  on
              offline/drained nodes.  It can be used as a (bulk) replacement for Ganeti's own <u>gnt-node</u> <u>evacuate</u>,
              with the note that it doesn't guarantee full evacuation.

       --restricted-migration
              This  parameter  disallows  any replace-primary moves (frf), as well as those replace-and-failover
              moves (rf) where the primary node of the instance is not  drained.   If  used  together  with  the
              --evac-mode  option,  the  only  migrations  that  hbal  will do are migrations of instances off a
              drained node.  This can be useful if during a reinstall of the base operating system migration  is
              only  possible  from  the  old OS to the new OS.  Note, however, that usually the use of migration
              tags is the better choice.

       --select-instances=*instances*
              This parameter marks the given instances (as a comma-separated list) as the only ones being  moved
              during the rebalance.

       --exclude-instances=*instances*
              This  parameter  marks the given instances (as a comma-separated list) from being moved during the
              rebalance.

       -U <u>util-file</u>
              This parameter specifies a file holding instance dynamic utilisation information that will be used
              to tweak the balancing algorithm to equalise load on the nodes  (as  opposed  to  static  resource
              usage).   The file is in the format "instance_name cpu_util mem_util disk_util net_util" where the
              "_util" parameters are interpreted as numbers  and  the  instance  name  must  match  exactly  the
              instance as read from Ganeti.  In case of unknown instance names, the program will abort.

              If not given, the default values are one for all metrics and thus dynamic utilisation has only one
              effect  on  the  algorithm:  the equalisation of the secondary instances across nodes (this is the
              only metric that is not tracked by another, dedicated value, and thus the disk load  of  instances
              will  cause secondary instance equalisation).  Note that value of one will also influence slightly
              the primary instance count, but that is already tracked via other metrics and thus  the  influence
              of the dynamic utilisation will be practically insignificant.

       --ignore-dynu
              If given, all dynamic utilisation information will be ignored by assuming it to be 0.  This option
              will take precedence over any data passed by the -U option or by the MonDs with the --mond and the
              --mond-data option.

       --ignore-soft-errors
              If  given,  all  checks for soft errors will be omitted when considering balancing moves.  In this
              way, progress can be made in a cluster where all nodes  are  in  a  policy-wise  bad  state,  like
              exceeding oversubscription ratios on CPU or spindles.

       -S <u>filename</u>, --save-cluster=*filename*
              If  given,  the  state  of  the  cluster  before the balancing is saved to the given file plus the
              extension "original" (i.e.  <u>filename</u>.original), and the state at the end of the balancing is saved
              to the given file plus the extension "balanced" (i.e.  <u>filename</u>.balanced).  This allows re-feeding
              the cluster state to either hbal itself or for example hspace via the -t option.

       -t <u>datafile</u>, --text-data=*datafile*
              Backend specification: the name of  the  file  holding  node  and  instance  information  (if  not
              collecting  via RAPI or LUXI).  This or one of the other backends must be selected.  The option is
              described in the man page <b><a href="../man1/htools.1.html">htools</a></b>(1).

       --mond=*yes|no*
              If given the program will query all MonDs to fetch data from the supported  data  collectors  over
              the network.

       --mond-xen
              If  given,  also  query  Xen-specific  collectors  from MonD, provided that monitoring daemons are
              queried at all.

       --exit-on-missing-mond-data
              If given, abort if the data obtainable from querying MonDs is incomplete.  The default behavior is
              to continue with a best guess based on the static information.

       --mond-data <u>datafile</u>
              The name of the file holding the data provided by  MonD,  to  override  querying  MonDs  over  the
              network.  This is mostly used for debugging.  The file must be in JSON format and present an array
              of  JSON  objects , one for every node, with two members.  The first member named node is the name
              of the node and the second member named reports is an array of report objects.  The report objects
              must be in the same format as produced by the monitoring agent.

       -m <u>cluster</u>
              Backend specification: collect data directly from the <u>cluster</u> given as an argument via RAPI.   The
              option is described in the man page <b><a href="../man1/htools.1.html">htools</a></b>(1).

       -L [<u>path</u>]
              Backend  specification: collect data directly from the master daemon, which is to be contacted via
              LUXI (an internal Ganeti protocol).  The option is described in the man page <b><a href="../man1/htools.1.html">htools</a></b>(1).

       -X     When using the Luxi backend, hbal can also execute the given commands.  The execution method is to
              execute the individual jobsets (see the <u>-C</u> option for details) in separate stages, aborting if  at
              any  time  a jobset doesn't have all jobs successful.  Each step in the balancing solution will be
              translated into exactly one Ganeti job (having between one and three OpCodes), and all  the  steps
              in a jobset will be executed in parallel.  The jobsets themselves are executed serially.

              The execution of the job series can be interrupted, see below for signal handling.

       -l <u>N</u>, --max-length=*N*
              Restrict  the  solution to this length.  This can be used for example to automate the execution of
              the balancing.

       --max-cpu=*cpu-ratio*
              The maximum virtual to physical cpu ratio, as a floating point number greater  than  or  equal  to
              one.   For  example,  specifying <u>cpu-ratio</u> as <b>2.5</b> means that, for a 4-cpu machine, a maximum of 10
              virtual cpus should be allowed to be in use for primary instances.  A value of exactly  one  means
              there  will  be no over-subscription of CPU (except for the CPU time used by the node itself), and
              values below one do not make sense, as that means other resources  (e.g.   disk)  won't  be  fully
              utilised due to CPU restrictions.

       --min-disk=*disk-ratio*
              The  minimum  amount  of  free  disk  space  remaining,  as a floating point number.  For example,
              specifying <u>disk-ratio</u> as <b>0.25</b> means that at least one quarter of disk space should be left free on
              nodes.

       -G <u>uuid</u>, --group=*uuid*
              On an multi-group cluster, select this group for processing.  Otherwise hbal will abort, since  it
              cannot balance multiple groups at the same time.

       -v, --verbose
              Increase  the  output verbosity.  Each usage of this option will increase the verbosity (currently
              more than 2 doesn't make sense) from the default of one.

       -q, --quiet
              Decrease the output verbosity.  Each usage of this option will decrease the verbosity  (less  than
              zero doesn't make sense) from the default of one.

       -V, --version
              Just show the program version and exit.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNAL</b> <b>HANDLING</b></h4><pre>
       When  executing jobs via LUXI (using the -X option), normally hbal will execute all jobs until either one
       errors out or all the jobs finish successfully.

       Since balancing can take a long time, it is possible to stop hbal early in two ways:

       • by sending a SIGINT (^C), hbal will register the termination request, and will wait until the currently
         submitted jobs finish, at which point it will exit (with exit code 0 if all  jobs  finished  correctly,
         otherwise with exit code 1 as usual)

       • by  sending  a  SIGTERM, hbal will immediately exit (with exit code 2); it is the responsibility of the
         user to follow up with Ganeti and check the result of the currently-executing jobs

       Note that in any situation, it's perfectly safe to kill hbal, either via the above  signals  or  via  any
       other  signal  (e.g.   SIGQUIT,  SIGKILL), since the jobs themselves are processed by Ganeti whereas hbal
       (after submission) only watches their progression.  In this case, the user will have to query Ganeti  for
       job results.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The  exit  status  of  the command will be zero, unless for some reason the algorithm failed (e.g.  wrong
       node or instance data), invalid command line options, or (in case of job execution) one of the  jobs  has
       failed.

       Once  job execution via Luxi has started (-X), if the balancing was interrupted early (via <u>SIGINT</u>, or via
       --max-length) but all jobs executed successfully, then the exit status is  zero;  a  non-zero  exit  code
       means that the cluster state should be investigated, since a job failed or we couldn't compute its status
       and this can also point to a problem on the Ganeti side.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  program  does  not check all its input data for consistency, and sometime aborts with cryptic errors
       messages with invalid data.

       The algorithm is not perfect.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Note that these examples are not for the latest version (they don't have full node data).

       In the above output, we can see:

       • the input data (here from files) shows a cluster with 20 nodes and 80 instances

       • the cluster is not initially N+1 compliant

       • the initial score is 0.52329131

       The  step  list  follows,  showing  the  instance,  its  initial primary/secondary nodes, the new primary
       secondary, the cluster list, and the actions taken in this step (with 'f' denoting  failover/migrate  and
       'r' denoting replace secondary).

       Finally, the program shows the improvement in cluster score.

       Here  we  see, beside the step list, the initial and final cluster status, with the final one showing all
       nodes being N+1 compliant, and the command list to reach the final solution.  In the initial listing,  we
       see which nodes are not N+1 compliant.

       The  algorithm is stable as long as each step above is fully completed, e.g.  in step 8, both the migrate
       and the replace-disks are done.  Otherwise, if only the migrate is done, the input data is changed  in  a
       way that the program will output a different solution list (but hopefully will end in the same state).
