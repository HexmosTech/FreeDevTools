       cwcp - curses-based Morse tutor program

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cwcp</b>   [-s --system=<u>SYSTEM</u>]   [-d --device=<u>DEVICE</u>]  [-w --wpm=<u>WPM</u>]  [-t --tone=<u>HZ</u>]  [-v --volume=<u>PERCENT</u>]
       [-g --gap=<u>GAP</u>]  [-k --weighting=<u>WEIGHT</u>]  [-T --time=<u>TIME</u>]  [-f,  --infile=<u>FILE</u>]   [-F,   --outifile=<u>FILE</u>]
       [-h --help] [-V --version]

       <b>cwcp</b> installed on GNU/Linux systems understands both short form and long form command line options.  <b>cwcp</b>
       installed on other operating systems may understand only the short form options.

       There are no mandatory options.

       Options  may  be predefined in the environment variable <b>CWCP_OPTIONS</b>.  If defined, these options are used
       first; command line options take precedence.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cwcp</b> is a curses-based interactive Morse code tutor program.  It allows menu selection from a  number  of
       sending modes, and also permits character sounding options, such as the tone pitch, and sending speed, to
       be varied from the keyboard using a full-screen user interface.

   <b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>cwcp</b>  understands the following command line options.  The long form options may not be available in non-
       LINUX versions.

       <u>-s,</u> <u>--system=SYSTEM</u>
              Specifies the way that <b>cwcp</b> generates tones.  Valid values are: <u>null</u> for no tones,  just  timings,
              <u>console</u>  for  tones through the console speaker, <u>alsa</u> for tones generated through the system sound
              card using ALSA sound system, <u>oss</u> for tones generated through system sound card  using  OSS  sound
              system,  <u>pulseaudio</u>  for  tones generated through system sound card using PulseAudio sound system,
              <u>soundcard</u> for tones generated through the system sound card, but  without  explicit  selection  of
              sound  system. These values can be shortened to 'n', 'c', 'a', 'o', 'p', or 's', respectively. The
              default value is 'pulseaudio'.

       <u>-d,</u> <u>--device=DEVICE</u>
              Specifies the device file to open for generating a sound.  <b>cwcp</b> will use default device if none is
              specified. The default devices are: <u>/dev/console</u> for sound produced through console,  <u>default</u>  for
              ALSA  sound system, <u>/dev/audio</u> for OSS sound system, <u>a</u> <u>default</u> <u>device</u> for PulseAudio sound system.
              See also <u>NOTES</u> <u>ON</u> <u>USING</u> <u>A</u> <u>SOUND</u> <u>CARD</u> below.

       <u>-w,</u> <u>--wpm=WPM</u>
              Sets the initial sending speed in words per minute.  The value must be  between  4  and  60.   The
              default value is 12 WPM.

       <u>-t,</u> <u>--tone=HZ</u>
              Sets  the  initial  sounder  pitch  in  Hz.  This value must be between 0 and 4,000.  A value of 0
              selects silent operation, and can be used for timing checks or other testing.  The  default  value
              is 800Hz,

       <u>-v,</u> <u>--volume=PERCENT</u>
              Sets  the initial sending volume, as a percentage of full scale volume.  The value must be between
              0 and 100.  The default value is 70 %.  Sound volumes work fully for sound card  tones,  but  <b>cwcp</b>
              cannot  control  the  volume of tones from the console speaker.  In this case, a volume of zero is
              silent, and all other volume values are simply sounded.

       <u>-g,</u> <u>--gap=GAP</u>
              Sets the initial extra gap, in dot lengths, between characters (the 'Farnsworth' delay).  It  must
              be between 0 and 60.  The default is 0.

       <u>-k,</u> <u>--weighting=WEIGHT</u>
              Sets  the  initial  weighting, as a percentage of dot lengths.  It must be between 20 and 80.  The
              default is 50.

       <u>-T,</u> <u>--time=TIME</u>
              Sets the initial practice time, in minutes.  <b>cwcp</b> stops after generating  random  Morse  code  for
              this period.  The value must be between 1 and 99.  The default is 15 minutes.

       <u>-f,</u> <u>--infile=FILE</u>
              Specifies  a  text  file  that  <b>cwcp</b>  can  read  to  configure  its  practice  text.  See <u>CREATING</u>
              <u>CONFIGURATION</u> <u>FILES</u> below.

       <u>-F,</u> <u>--outfile=FILE</u>
              Specifies a text file to which <b>cwcp</b> should write its current practice text.

       <u>-h,</u> <u>--help</u>
              Prints short help message.

       <u>-V,</u> <u>--version</u>
              Prints information about program's version, authors and license.

   <b>USER</b> <b>INTERFACE</b>
       <b>cwcp</b> is a curses-based program that takes over the complete operation of the terminal on which it is run.
       If colours are available on the terminal, it will produce a colour interface.

       The <b>cwcp</b> screen is divided into several distinct areas:

       <u>The</u> <u>Menu</u> <u>Selection</u> <u>window</u>
              The Menu Selection window shows the main modes that <b>cwcp</b> offers.  Use the <u>F10</u> and <u>F11</u> or  <u>KEY_DOWN</u>
              and <u>KEY_UP</u> keys to select the mode.  <u>F9</u> or <u>Return</u> start sending, and <u>F9</u> again or <u>Esc</u> stop sending.
              Changing mode also stops sending.

       <u>The</u> <u>Morse</u> <u>Code</u> <u>Display</u> <u>window</u>
              This window displays each Morse code character after it has been sent.

       <u>The</u> <u>Speed</u> <u>Control</u> <u>window</u>
              The  Speed window shows the current Morse code sending speed in words per minute.  Pressing the <u>F2</u>
              or <u>KEY_RIGHT</u> keys increases the speed; pressing the <u>F1</u> or <u>KEY_LEFT</u> keys decreases the speed.

       <u>The</u> <u>Tone</u> <u>Control</u> <u>window</u>
              This window shows the current Morse code tone pitch.  Use the <u>F4</u> or <u>KEY_HOME</u> key to  increase  the
              pitch, and the <u>F3</u> or <u>KEY_END</u> key to decrease it.  Values change in steps of 20Hz.

       <u>The</u> <u>Volume</u> <u>Control</u> <u>window</u>
              This  window  shows the current Morse code volume.  Use the <u>F6</u> key to increase the volume, and the
              <u>F5</u> key to decrease it.  Values change in steps of 1%.  Note that <b>cwcp</b> cannot control the volume of
              the console speaker, so the volume control only works effectively for tones generated on the sound
              card.

       <u>The</u> <u>Gap</u> <u>Control</u> <u>window</u>
              This window shows the current additional 'Farnsworth' gaps to be appended after  each  Morse  code
              character is sounded.  Use <u>F8</u> to increase the gap, and <u>F7</u> to decrease it.

       <u>The</u> <u>Time</u> <u>Control</u> <u>window</u>
              This  window  shows  the selected practice time.  After generating Morse code in a particular mode
              for this amount of time, <b>cwcp</b> stops automatically.   Use  <u>KEY_NPAGE</u>  to  increase  the  time,  and
              <u>KEY_PPAGE</u>  to decrease it.  During sending, the value in this window counts down to one, and after
              final minute of sending has elapsed, <b>cwcp</b> stops sending.  The timer operates like a  microwave  or
              kitchen  timer;  it  counts  down  on its own, but the time remaining can also be altered manually
              while the timer operates.

       The following keys vary the screen colours:

       <u>{</u> <u>key</u>  Changes the foreground colour of the window boxes.

       <u>}</u> <u>key</u>  Changes the background colour of the window boxes.

       <u>[</u> <u>key</u>  Changes the foreground colour of the window contents.

       <u>]</u> <u>key</u>  Changes the background colour of the window contents.

       Eight screen colours are available for each: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan,  and  white.
       Use a key to cycle round these colours for the particular part of the display controlled by that key.  On
       a change of colours, the complete screen is repainted.

       Use  <u>Ctrl-L</u>  to repaint the complete screen, in case of screen corruption.  Use <u>Ctrl-V</u> to clear the Morse
       Code Display Window.  This command is available only when <b>cwcp</b> is not sending.

       To leave <b>cwcp</b>, press <u>F12</u> or <u>Ctrl-C</u>, or select <u>Exit</u> on the mode menu.

       All of the above command keys may be used while random characters are being sent, and when keyboard input
       is being sent.

       If function keys are not available on the terminal, <u>Ctrl-&lt;key&gt;</u> combinations can be used.  On the top  row
       of  letter  keys on the keyboard, the keys <u>Ctrl-Q</u> to <u>Ctrl-I</u> may be used as alternatives for <u>F1</u> to <u>F8</u>, and
       on the second row of letter keys, <u>Ctrl-A</u> to <u>Ctrl-F</u> as alternatives for <u>F9</u>  to  <u>F12</u>.   For  <u>KEY_PPAGE</u>  and
       <u>KEY_NPAGE</u>, use <u>Ctrl-O</u> and <u>Ctrl-P</u>.

   <b>RANDOM</b> <b>CHARACTERS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>WORDS</b>
       <b>cwcp</b>  sends  random  characters  in  groups  of five, with a space between each group.  After a period of
       sending, set in the <u>Time</u> <u>Control</u> <u>window</u>, <b>cwcp</b> stops automatically.  It  can  also  be  stopped  manually,
       before this time period expires.

       When  sending  random  words, <b>cwcp</b> sends the complete word, followed by a space.  Because short words are
       easier to copy without writing, <b>cwcp</b>'s default dictionary contains  only  three,  four,  and  five-letter
       words in its random words list.

       <b>cwcp</b>  chooses  at random from a list of around 3000 words in its default dictionary.  You can change this
       text using a configuration file, read at startup.  See <u>CREATING</u> <u>CONFIGURATION</u> <u>FILES</u> below.

   <b>NOTES</b> <b>ON</b> <b>USING</b> <b>A</b> <b>SOUND</b> <b>CARD</b>
       By default, <b>cw</b> tries to open default PulseAudio. If PulseAudio server is not accessible, cw tries to open
       OSS device "/dev/audio" to access the system sound card.  This is generally the correct  device  to  use,
       but for systems with special requirements, or those with multiple sound cards, the option <u>-d</u> or <u>--device</u>,
       combined  with  <u>-s</u>  or <u>--system</u> can be used to specify the device and sound system for sound card access.
       If the sound card device cannot be set up, <b>cwcp</b> prints the error message

              cannot set up soundcard sound

       and exits.

       Sound card devices, when opened through OSS sound system, are usually single-access devices, so that when
       one process has opened the device, other processes are prevented from using it. In such cases  <b>cwcp</b>  will
       of  course  conflict  with  any  other  programs  that expect exclusive use of the system sound card (for
       example, MP3 players).  If <b>cwcp</b> finds that the sound card is already busy, it prints the error message

              open /dev/audio: Device or resource busy

       and exits.

       The sound card device is not used if <b>cwcp</b> is only sending tones on the console speaker.

   <b>SOUND</b> <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>-</b> <b>DEFAULTS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SELECTION</b>
       <b>cwcp</b> first tries to access sound card using PulseAudio sound system, using default  device  name,  unless
       user specifies other sound device with option <u>-d</u> or <u>--device</u>.

       <b>cwcp</b>  then  tries  to  access  sound  card  using  OSS  sound  system  and  default OSS sound device name
       ('/dev/audio'), unless user specifies other sound device with option <u>-d</u> or <u>--device</u>.

       If opening soundcard through OSS fails, <b>cwcp</b> tries to access the sound card using ALSA sound system,  and
       default  ALSA  sound  device name ('default'), unless user specifies other sound device with option <u>-d</u> or
       <u>--device</u>.

       If opening soundcard through ALSA also fails, <b>cwcp</b> tries to access system console  buzzer  using  default
       buzzer device '/dev/console', unless user specifies other sound device with option <u>-d</u> or <u>--device</u>.

       It  is  very  common  that in order to access the console buzzer device user has to have root privileges.
       For that reason trying to open console buzzer almost always fails.  This is not a program's bug, this  is
       a  result of operating system's restrictions.  Making <b>cwcp</b> an suid binary bypasses this restriction.  The
       program does not fork() or exec(), so making it suid should be relatively safe.  Note however  that  this
       practice is discouraged for security reasons.

       As  stated,  user can tell <b>cwcp</b> which device to use, using <u>-d</u> or <u>--device</u> option.  Which device files are
       suitable will depend on which operating system is running, which system user ID runs <b>cwcp</b>, and which user
       groups user belongs to.

   <b>CREATING</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILES</b>
       <b>cwcp</b> contains a default set of modes and practice text that should be  enough  to  begin  with.   It  can
       however  read in a file at startup that reconfigures these to provide different character groupings, word
       sets, and other practice data.

       To read a configuration file, use the <u>-f</u> or <u>--infile</u> command line options.   The  file  should  introduce
       each  <b>cwcp</b>  mode  with a section header in '[' ... ']' characters, followed by the practice text for that
       mode, with elements separated by whitespace.  Lines starting with a semicolon  or  hash  are  treated  as
       comments.  For example

              ; Simple example mode
              [ A to Z ]
              A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

       <b>cwcp</b>  will  generate  five character groups for modes whose elements are all single characters, and treat
       other modes as having elements that are complete words.  As a starting point for customized  modes,  <b>cwcp</b>
       will  write its default configuration to a file if given the undocumented <u>-#</u> option, for example "cwcp -#
       /tmp/cwcp.ini".

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cwcp</b> owes its existence to the DOS Morse code tutor CP222C.EXE, by VU2ZAP.  CP222C.EXE  seemed  to  offer
       the  right  range  of  facilities  for learning Morse code in a simple, easy-to-use, and compact package.
       <b>cwcp</b> is very much modeled on that DOS program, and should prove useful both for learning  the  code,  and
       for experienced CW users who want, or need, to improve their receiving speed.

       Curses  may  impose a delay when recognizing the <u>Esc</u> key alone, as this character is often the first of a
       sequence generated by a function key.  <b>cwcp</b> responds instantly to <u>F9</u>.

       The characters echoed in the Morse Code Display window may be ASCII representations of  Morse  procedural
       signals; see the <b>cw</b>(7,LOCAL) man page for details.

   <b>HINTS</b> <b>ON</b> <b>LEARNING</b> <b>MORSE</b> <b>CODE</b>
       Here are a few hints and tips that may help with the process of learning Morse code.

       Firstly,  do  <b>NOT</b>  think of the elements as dots and dashes.  Instead, think of them as dits and dahs (so
       'A' is di-dah).  If you think of them in this way, the process of translating sound into characters  will
       be learned much more easily.

       Do  not  learn  the characters from a table.  Learn them by watching the groups appear on the screen, and
       listening to the sounds produced as each is sent.  In the very initial stages, it may  be  beneficial  if
       you can find a person to take you through the first stages of recognizing characters.

       Do  not  waste  your  time  learning  Morse  code at 5 WPM.  Set the speed to 12 or 15 WPM, but use extra
       spacing (the Gap window) to reduce the effective speed to much lower - around four or five WPM  <u>effective</u>
       speed.   This way, you will learn the rhythm of the characters as they are sent, but still have plenty of
       time between characters.  As you practice, decrease the gap to zero.

       Learn in stages.  Start by learning the <u>EISH5</u> group, then progress down through the menu as each group is
       mastered.  The groups contain characters which are in some way related, either by sound, or  by  type  of
       character.

       Once  you have completed all the groups <u>EISH5</u> to <u>"'$(+:</u><b>_</b> (or <u>23789</u> if you do not want to learn procedural
       signals yet), use the full character set options, and the words and CW words  options,  to  sharpen  your
       skill.  If you have difficulties with particular characters, return to that group and practice again with
       a smaller character set.

       Resist  the  temptation to try to learn or improve your speed by copying off-air.  You will not know what
       speed you are working at, and much hand-sent Morse is not perfectly formed.  What you  can  gain  off-air
       though  is a general 'resilience', a tolerance for Morse code where the timing of individual elements, or
       spacing between characters and words, is not 100% accurate.

       If working to attain a particular speed for a test, always set the speed slightly higher.   For  example,
       if  aiming  for  12 WPM, set the tutor speed to 14 or 15 WPM.  This way, when you drop back to 12 WPM you
       will feel much more relaxed about copying.  Be aware that <b>cwcp</b>  is  not  necessarily  going  to  send  at
       exactly  the speed you set, due to limitations in what can be done with UNIX timers.  It often sends at a
       slower speed than you set, so be very careful with this if you have a  target  speed  that  you  need  to
       reach.

       Use  the  program  to make cassette tapes that you can take with you in a walkman or in the car, for long
       journeys.  You do not have to write down everything you hear to practice Morse code.  Simply listening to
       the shapes of characters over a period will help to train your brain  into  effortless  recognition.   In
       fact, slavishly writing everything down becomes a barrier at speeds of 15-20 WPM and above, so if you can
       begin to copy without writing each character down, you will find progress much easier above these speeds.
       But  do  not  over-use  these  tapes,  otherwise you will quickly memorize them.  Re-record them with new
       contents at very regular intervals.

       Try to spend at least 15-30 minutes each  day  practicing.   Much  less  than  this  will  make  progress
       glacially slow.  But significantly more than an hour or so may just result in you becoming tired, but not
       improving.  Recognize when it is time to stop for the day.

       Do  not  worry  if  you reach a speed 'plateau'.  This is common, and you will soon pass it with a little
       perseverance.

       At higher speeds, CW operators tend to recognize the 'shape' of whole words, rather than  the  individual
       characters  within  the words.  The CW words menu option can be used to help to practice and develop this
       skill.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>OMISSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The calibration option is a bit ropy.  It simply sends PARIS repeatedly, and relies on you  to  time  the
       sending  and  then work out if any adjustment to the speed is really necessary.  Automatic calibration by
       making measurements over a given period would be a lot better.

       Generating random CW QSOs would be fun to do.

       A facility to allow a user to key Morse into the system, and to  have  it  send  code,  and  measure  the
       accuracy of keying, would be nice.
