</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       out123 - send raw PCM audio or a waveform pattern to an output device

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cat</b> audio.raw | <b>out123</b> [ - ] [ <u>options</u>  ]

       <b>out123</b> [ <u>options</u> ] <u>filename</u> [ <u>filename</u> ... ]

       <b>out123</b> --wave-freq <u>freq1</u>[,<u>freq2</u>,...] [ <u>options</u> ]

       <b>out123</b> --source geiger [ <u>options</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>out123</b>  reads  raw  PCM  data  (in  host byte order) from standard input and plays it on the audio device
       specified by given options.  Alternatively, it can generate  periodic  or  random  signals  for  playback
       itself.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>out123</b>  options  may  be  either the traditional POSIX one letter options, or the GNU style long options.
       POSIX style options start with a single '-', while GNU long options start with  '--'.   Option  arguments
       (if  needed)  follow  separated  by whitespace (not '=').  Note that some options can be absent from your
       installation when disabled in the build process.

       <b>--name</b> <u>name</u>
              Set the name of this instance, possibly used in various places. This sets the client name for JACK
              output.

       <b>-o</b> <u>module</u>, --<b>output</b> <u>module</u>
              Select audio output module. You can provide a comma-separated list  to  use  the  first  one  that
              works.  Also see <b>-a</b>.

       <b>--list-modules</b>
              List the available modules.

       <b>--list-devices</b>
              List  the  available  output devices for given output module. If there is no functionality to list
              devices in the chosen module, an error will be printed and out123 will exit with a non-zero code.

       <b>-a</b> <u>dev</u>, <b>--audiodevice</b> <u>dev</u>
              Specify the audio device to use.  The default as well as the possible values depend on the  active
              output.  For the JACK output, a comma-separated list of ports to connect to (for each channel) can
              be specified.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--stdout</b>
              The audio samples are written to standard output,  instead  of  playing  them  through  the  audio
              device.   The  output format is the same as the input ... so in this mode, <b>out123</b> acts similar the
              standard tool  <b>cat</b>, possibly with some conversions involved.  This shortcut is equivalent  to  '-o
              raw -a -'.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--STDOUT</b>
              This  variant additionally writes the data to stdout, while still playing it on the output device.
              So it is more like some flavour of <b>tee</b> than a <b>cat</b>.

       <b>-O</b> <u>file</u>, <b>--outfile</b>
              Write raw output into a file (instead of simply redirecting standard output to  a  file  with  the
              shell).  This shortcut is equivalent to '-o raw -a <u>file</u>'.

       <b>-w</b> <u>file</u>, <b>--wav</b>
              Write  output as WAV file <u>file</u> , or standard output if <u>-</u> is or the empty string used as file name.
              You can also use <u>--au</u> and <u>--cdr</u> for AU and CDR format, respectively. Note that WAV/AU  writing  to
              non-seekable  files  or redirected stdout needs some thought. The header is written with the first
              actual data. The result of decoding nothing to WAV/AU is a file consisting just of the header when
              it is seekable and really nothing when not (not  even  a  header).  Correctly  writing  data  with
              prophetic headers to stdout is no easy business.  This shortcut is equivalent to '-o wav -a <u>file</u>'.

       <b>--au</b> <u>file</u>
              Write  to <u>file</u> in SUN audio format.  If - or the empty string is used as the filename, the AU file
              is written to stdout. See paragraph about WAV writing for header fun  with  non-seekable  streams.
              This shortcut is equivalent to '-o au -a <u>file</u>'.

       <b>--cdr</b> <u>file</u>
              Write  to  <u>file</u> as a CDR (CD-ROM audio, more correctly CDDA for Compact Disc Digital Audio).  If -
              is or the empty string used as the filename, the CDR file is written to stdout.  This shortcut  is
              equivalent to '-o cdr -a <u>file</u>'.

       <b>-r</b> <u>rate</u>, <b>--rate</b> <u>rate</u>
              Set sample rate in Hz (default: 44100). If this does not match the actual input sampling rate, you
              get changed pitch. Might be intentional;-)

       <b>-R</b> <u>rate</u>, <b>--inputrate</b> <u>rate</u>
              Set  input sample rate to a different value. This triggers resampling if the output rate is indeed
              different. See <b>--resample</b>.

       <b>--speed</b> <u>factor</u>
              Speed up/down playback by that factor using resampling. See <b>--resample</b>.

       <b>--resample</b> <u>method</u>
              This chooses the method for resampling between differing sampling rates or to apply  a  change  in
              tempo.  You can choose between two variants of the syn123 resampler: fine (the default) and dirty.
              The fine one features 108 dB dynamic range and at worst-case 84% bandwidth. The dirty one  uses  a
              bit  less  CPU time (not that much, though) by reducing the dynamic range to 72 dB with worst-case
              bandwidth of  85%.  The  exact  properties  vary  with  the  sampling  rate  ratio,  as  there  is
              interpolation of filter coefficients involved.

       <b>-c</b> <u>count</u>, <b>--channels</b> <u>count</u>
              Set channel count to given value.

       <b>-C</b> <u>count</u>, <b>--inputch</b> <u>count</u>
              Set  input  channel  count  to a differnt value than for output. This probably means you want some
              remixing. Also see <b>--mix</b>.

       <b>-e</b> <u>enc</u>, <b>--encoding</b> <u>enc</u>
              Choose output sample encoding. Possible values look like f32 (32-bit floating point), s32  (32-bit
              signed  integer),  u32  (32-bit  unsigned integer) and the variants with different numbers of bits
              (s24, u24, s16, u16, s8, u8) and also special variants like ulaw and alaw 8-bit.  See  the  output
              of <b>out123</b>'s longhelp for actually available encodings.  Default is s16.

       <b>--endian</b> <u>choice</u>
              Select output endianess (byte order). Choice is big, little, or native, which is the default.  The
              processing can only work in native mode, so you need to specify input or output byte order if that
              does not match your machine. This also sets the input endianess if that is not set separately. See
              also <b>--inputend</b> and <b>--byteswap</b>.

       <b>-E</b> <u>enc</u>, <b>--inputenc</b> <u>enc</u>
              Specify input encoding different from output encoding for conversion.

       <b>--inputend</b> <u>choice</u>
              Select  input  endianess  (byte  order).  By  default  it  is  the same as output byte order.  See
              <b>--endian</b>.

       <b>--byteswap</b>
              A switch to trigger swapping of byte order just before output, after  any  other  transformations.
              This works on top of any endianess you specify with

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--mono</b>
              Set for single-channel audio (default is two channels, stereo).

       <b>--stereo</b>
              Select stereo output (2 channels, default).

       <b>--list-encodings</b>
              List known encoding short and long names to standard output.

       <b>--mix</b> <u>matrix</u>
              Specify  a mixing matrix between input and output channels as linear factors, comma separated list
              for the input channel factors for output channel 1, then output channel  2,  and  so  forth.   The
              default  is  a  unit  matrix  if  channel  counts  match, so for 3 channels the equivalent of both
              channels with halved amplitude, so '--mix 0.5,0.5'. For splitting mono to  stereo,  it  is  '--mix
              1,1' top keep the symmetry.

       <b>--filter</b> <u>coeff</u>
              Apply digital filter(s) before pre-amplification (see <b>--preamp</b>) with the coefficient list coeff as
                                                   b_0,...,b_N,a_0,...,a_N
              where  a_0=1  is  mandatory and perhaps helps orientation a bit. Multiple filters are separated by
              ':'.

       <b>-P</b> <u>dbvalue</u> <b>--preamp</b> <u>dbvalue</u>
              Enable a pre-amplification stage that amplifies the signal with  the  given  value  in  dB  before
              output.

       <b>--offset</b> <u>value</u>
              Apply  a  PCM  offset  (floating  point  value  scaled  in  [-1:1] in the pre-amplification stage.
              Normally, you would do that to correct a known DC offset in a recording.

       <b>--clip</b> <u>mode</u>
              Select clipping mode: 'soft' or 'hard'  for  forced  clipping  also  for  floating  point  output,
              'implicit' (default) for implied hard clipping during conversion where necessary.

       <b>--dither</b>
              Enable dithering for conversions to integer. If you insist.  This is just some un-spectacular TPDF
              dither. For some people, that is not fancy enough.  Most people cannot be bothered that way or the
              other.

       <b>--test-format</b>
              Check if given format is supported by given driver and device (in command line before encountering
              this), silently returning 0 as exit value if it is the case.

       <b>--test-encodings</b>
              Print out the short names of encodings supported with the current setup.

       <b>--query-format</b>
              If  the  selected  driver and device communicate some default accepted format, print out a command
              line fragment for <b>out123</b> setting that format, always in that  order:  --rate  &lt;r&gt;  --channels  &lt;c&gt;
              --encoding &lt;e&gt;

       <b>-o</b> <b>h</b>, <b>--headphones</b>
              Direct audio output to the headphone connector (some hardware only; AIX, HP, SUN).

       <b>-o</b> <b>s</b>, <b>--speaker</b>
              Direct audio output to the speaker  (some hardware only; AIX, HP, SUN).

       <b>-o</b> <b>l</b>, <b>--lineout</b>
              Direct audio output to the line-out connector (some hardware only; AIX, HP, SUN).

       <b>-b</b> <u>size</u>, <b>--buffer</b> <u>size</u>
              Use an audio output buffer of <u>size</u> Kbytes.  This is useful to bypass short periods of heavy system
              activity,  which  would  normally  cause the audio output to be interrupted.  You should specify a
              buffer size of at least 1024 (i.e. 1 Mb, which equals about 6 seconds  of  usual  audio  data)  or
              more; less than about 300 does not make much sense.  The default is 0, which turns buffering off.

       <b>--preload</b> <u>fraction</u>
              Wait  for the buffer to be filled to <u>fraction</u> before starting playback (fraction between 0 and 1).
              You can tune this prebuffering to either get sound faster to your ears or safer uninterrupted  web
              radio.  Default is 0.2 (changed from 1 since version 1.23).

       <b>--devbuffer</b> <u>seconds</u>
              Set  device  buffer  in  seconds;  &lt;=  0 means default value. This is the small buffer between the
              application and the audio backend, possibly directly related to hardware buffers.

       <b>--timelimit</b> <u>samples</u>
              Set playback time limit in PCM samples if set to a value greater  than  zero.   <b>out123</b>  will  stop
              reading from stdin or playing from the generated wave table after reaching that number of samples.

       <b>--seconds</b> <u>seconds</u>
              Set time limit in seconds instead.

       <b>--source</b> <u>name</u>
              Choose  the  signal source: 'file' (default) for playback of the given file(s) on the command line
              or standard input if there are none, or one of the generators  'wave'  (see  <b>--wave-freq</b>),  geiger
              (see <b>--geiger-activity</b>), or just 'white' for some white noise.

       <b>--wave-freq</b> <u>frequencies</u>
              Set  wave generator frequency or list of those with comma separation for enabling a generated test
              signal instead of standard input. Empty values repeat the previous one.

       <b>--wave-pat</b> <u>patterns</u>
              Set the waveform patterns of the generated waves as comma-separated list.  Choices  include  sine,
              square, triangle, sawtooth, gauss, pulse, and shot.  Empty values repeat the previous one.

       <b>--wave-phase</b> <u>phases</u>
              Set waveform phase shift(s) as comma-separated list, negative values inverting the pattern in time
              and  empty  value  repeating  the previous. There is also <b>--wave-direction</b> overriding the negative
              bit.

       <b>--wave-direction</b>
              Set wave direction explicitly (the sign counts).

       <b>--wave-sweep</b> <u>frequency</u>
              Sweep a generated wave to the given frequency, from first one specified for <b>--wave-freq</b>, using the
              first wave pattern and direction, too.

       <b>--sweep-time</b> <u>seconds</u>
              Set frequency sweep duration in seconds if &gt; 0. This defaults to the configured time limit if set,
              otherwise one second, as endless sweeps are not sensible.

       <b>--sweep-count</b> <u>count</u>
              Set timelimit to exactly produce that many (smooth) sweeps

       <b>--sweep-type</b> <u>type</u>
              Set sweep type: lin(ear) for linear, qua(d) (default)  for  quadratic,  or  exp(onential)  for  an
              exponential change of frequency with time.

       <b>--sweep-hard</b>
              Disable post-sweep smoothing for periodicity.

       <b>--genbuffer</b> <u>bytes</u>
              Set  the  buffer  size  (limit)  for signal generators, if &gt; 0 (default), this enforces a periodic
              buffer also for non-periodic signals,  benefit:  less  runtime  CPU  overhead,  as  everything  is
              precomputed as enforced periodic signal.

       <b>--wave-limit</b> <u>samples</u>
              This is an alias for <b>--genbuffer</b>.

       <b>--pink-rows</b> <u>number</u>
              Activate  pink noise source and choose rows for the algorithm (&lt;1 chooses default).  The generator
              follows code provided by Phil Burk (<a href="http://softsynth.com">http://softsynth.com</a>) and uses the Gardner method.

       <b>--geiger-activity</b> <u>number</u>
              This configures the simulation of a Geiger-Mueller counter as source,  with  the  given  numer  as
              average events per second. Play with it. It's fun!

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--test</b>
              Test mode.  The audio stream is read, but no output occurs.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Increase the verbosity level.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
              Quiet.  Suppress diagnostic messages.

       <b>--aggressive</b>
              Tries to get higher priority

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--realtime</b>
              Tries to gain realtime priority.  This option usually requires root privileges to have any effect.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Shows short usage instructions.

       <b>--longhelp</b>
              Shows long usage instructions.

       <b>--version</b>
              Print the version string.
