</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       With  PAR 2.0 you can create PAR2 recovery files for as few as 1 or as many as 32768 files. If you wanted
       to create PAR1 recovery files for a single file you are forced to split the file into muliple  parts  and
       RAR is frequently used for this purpose. You do NOT need to split files with PAR 2.0.

       To  create  PAR  2  recovery  files  for  a  single data file (e.g. one called test.mpg), you can use the
       following command:

         par2 create test.mpg

       If test.mpg is an 800 MB file, then this will create a total of 8 PAR2 files with the following filenames
       (taking roughly 6 minutes on a PC with a 1500MHz CPU):

         test.mpg.par2   - This is an index file for verification only
         test.mpg.vol00+01.par2 - Recovery file with 1 recovery block
         test.mpg.vol01+02.par2 - Recovery file with 2 recovery blocks
         test.mpg.vol03+04.par2 - Recovery file with 4 recovery blocks
         test.mpg.vol07+08.par2 - Recovery file with 8 recovery blocks
         test.mpg.vol15+16.par2 - Recovery file with 16 recovery blocks
         test.mpg.vol31+32.par2 - Recovery file with 32 recovery blocks
         test.mpg.vol63+37.par2 - Recovery file with 37 recovery blocks

       The test.mpg.par2 file is 39 KB in size and the other files vary in size from 443 KB to 15 MB. These par2
       files will enable the recovery of up to 100 errors totalling 40 MB of  lost  or  damaged  data  from  the
       original  test.mpg  file  when  it  and the par2 files are posted on UseNet. When posting on UseNet it is
       recommended that you use the "-s" option to set a blocksize that is equal to the Article  size  that  you
       will  use  to post the data file. If you wanted to post the test.mpg file using an article size of 300 KB
       then the command you would type is:

         par2 create -s307200 test.mpg

       This will create 9 PAR2 files instead of 8, and they will be capable  of  correcting  up  to  134  errors
       totalling  40 MB. It will take roughly 8 minutes to create the recovery files this time. In both of these
       two examples, the total quantity of recovery data created was 40 MB (which is 5% of 800 MB). If you  wish
       to  create  a  greater  or  lesser  quantity of recovery data, you can use the "-r" option. To create 10%
       recovery data instead of the default of 5% and also to use a block size of 300  KB,  you  would  use  the
       following command:

         par2 create -s307200 -r10 test.mpg

       This  would also create 9 PAR2 files, but they would be able to correct up to 269 errors totalling 80 MB.
       Since twice as much recovery data is created, it will take about 16 minutes to do so with a 1500MHz  CPU.
       The  "-u" and "-n" options can be used to control exactly how many recovery files are created and how the
       recovery blocks are distributed amoungst them. They do not affect the total  quantity  of  recovery  data
       created.  The  "-f"  option  is  used  when you create additional recovery data. e.g. If you have already
       created 10% and want another 5% then you migh use the following command:

         par2 create -s307200 -r5 -f300 test.mpg

       This specifies the same block size (which is a requirement for additional recovery  files),  5%  recovery
       data, and a first block number of 300.

       The "-m" option controls how much memory par2 uses. It defaults to 16 MB unless you override it.

       CREATING PAR2 FILES FOR MULTIPLE DATA FILES

       When creating PAR2 recovery files form multiple data files, you must specify the base filename to use for
       the  par2  files  and  the  names  of all of the data files. If test.mpg had been split into multiple RAR
       files, then you could use:

         par2 create test.mpg.rar.par2 test.mpg.part*.rar

       The  files  filename  "test.mpg.rar.par2"  says  what  you  want  the  par2  files  to  be   called   and
       "test.mpg.part*.rar" should select all of the RAR files.

       VERIFYING AND REPAIRING

       When  using par2 recovery files to verify or repair the data files from which they were created, you only
       need to specify the filename of one of the par2 files to par2. For example:

         par2 verify test.mpg.par2

       This tells par2 to use the information in test.mpg.par2 to verify the data files. Par2 will automatically
       search for the other par2 files that were created and use the information they contain to  determine  the
       filenames of the original data files and then to verify them.  If all of the data files are ok, then par2
       will  report that repair will not be required. If any of the data files are missing or damaged, par2 will
       report the details of what it has found. If the recovery files contain enough recovery blocks  to  repair
       the  damage,  you  will  be  told  that  repair  is possible. Otherwise you will be told exactly how many
       recovery blocks will be required in order to repair. To carry out a repair use the following command:

         par2 repair test.mpg.par2

       This tells par2 to verify and if possible repair any damaged or missing files. If  a  repair  is  carried
       out, then each file which is repaired will be re-verified to confirm that the repair was successful.

       MISSNAMED AND INCOMPLETE DATA FILES

       If any of the recovery files or data files have the wrong filename, then par2 will not automatically find
       and scan them. To have par2 scan such files, you must include them on the command line when attempting to
       verify or repair; e.g.:

         par2 r test.mpg.par2 other.mpg

       This  tells  par2  to  scan  the  file  called  other.mpg to see if it contains any data belonging to the
       original data files. If one of the extra files specified in this way is an exact match for a  data  file,
       then  the  repair  process  will  rename  the  file  so that it has the correct filename. Because par2 is
       designed to be able to find good data within a damaged file, it can do the  same  with  incomplete  files
       downloaded  from  UseNet.  If  some of the articles for a file are missing, you should still download the
       file and save it to disk for par2 to scan. If you do this then you may find that  you  can  carry  out  a
       repair in a situation where you would not otherwise have sufficient recovery data. You can have par2 scan
       all files that are in the current directory using a command such as:

         par2 r test.mpg.par2 *

       WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU ARE TOLD YOU NEED MORE RECOVERY BLOCKS

       If par2 determines that any of the data files are damaged or missing and finds that there is insufficient
       recovery data to effect a repair, you will be told that you need a certain number of recovery blocks. You
       can  obtain these by downloading additional recovery files. In order to make things easy, par2 files have
       filenames that tell you exactly how many recovery blocks each one contains. Assuming that  the  following
       command was used to create recovery data:

         par2 c -b1000 -r5 test.mpg

       Then the recovery files that are created would be called:

         test.mpg.par2
         test.mpg.vol00+01.par2
         test.mpg.vol01+02.par2
         test.mpg.vol03+04.par2
         test.mpg.vol07+08.par2
         test.mpg.vol15+16.par2
         test.mpg.vol31+19.par2

       The  first  file in this list does not contain any recovery data, it only contains information sufficient
       to verify the data files. Each of the other files contains a different number  of  recovery  blocks.  The
       number  after  the '+' sign is the number of recovery blocks and the number preceding the '+' sign is the
       block number of the first recovery block in that file. If par2 told  you  that  you  needed  10  recovery
       blocks,  then  you  would  need "test.mpg.vol01+02.par2" and "test.mpg.vol07+08.par". You might of course
       choose to fetch "test.mpg.vol15+16.par2" instead (in which case you would have an extra 6 recovery blocks
       which would not be used for the repair).

       HASHING

       Hashing portion (file verification and creation  stages)  of  the  code  can't  be  parallelized  without
       processing multiple files simultaneously. The 2 file/thread default is a good choice for HDDs, using more
       threads  can  result  in  worse performance. Four or more threads can be used for better performance with
       SSDs.
