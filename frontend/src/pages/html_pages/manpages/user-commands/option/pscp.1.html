</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pscp</b> - command-line SCP (secure copy) / SFTP client

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pscp</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>user</u><b>@</b>]<u>host</u><b>:</b><u>source</u> <u>target</u>
       <b>pscp</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>source</u> [<u>source</u>...] [<u>user</u><b>@</b>]<u>host</u><b>:</b><u>target</u>
       <b>pscp</b> [<u>options</u>] <b>-ls</b> [<u>user</u><b>@</b>]<u>host</u><b>:</b><u>filespec</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pscp</b>  is  a  command-line  client  for  the  SSH-based  SCP  (secure copy) and SFTP (secure file transfer
       protocol) protocols.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The command-line options supported by <u>pscp</u> are:

       <b>-V</b>     Show version information and exit.

       <b>-pgpfp</b> Display the fingerprints of the PuTTY PGP Master Keys and exit, to  aid  in  verifying  new  files
              released by the PuTTY team.

       <b>-ls</b>    Remote directory listing.

       <b>-p</b>     Preserve file attributes.

       <b>-q</b>     Quiet, don't show statistics.

       <b>-r</b>     Copy directories recursively.

       <b>-unsafe</b>
              Allow server-side wildcards (DANGEROUS).

       <b>-v</b>     Show verbose messages.

       <b>-load</b> <u>session</u>
              Load settings from saved session.

       <b>-P</b> <u>port</u>
              Connect to port <u>port</u>.

       <b>-proxycmd</b> <u>command</u>
              Instead  of making a TCP connection, use <u>command</u> as a proxy; network traffic will be redirected to
              the standard input and output of <u>command</u>. <u>command</u> must be a single word,  so  is  likely  to  need
              quoting by the shell.

              The  special  strings  <b>%host</b> and <b>%port</b> in <u>command</u> will be replaced by the hostname and port number
              you want to connect to; to get a literal <b>%</b> sign, enter <b>%%</b>.

              Backslash escapes are also supported, such as sequences  like  <b>\n</b>  being  replaced  by  a  literal
              newline; to get a literal backslash, enter <b>\\</b>. (Further escaping may be required by the shell.)

              (See  the  main  PuTTY manual for full details of the supported <b>%</b>- and backslash-delimited tokens,
              although most of them are probably not very useful in this context.)

       <b>-l</b> <u>user</u>
              Set remote username to <u>user</u>.

       <b>-batch</b> Disable interactive prompts.

       <b>-no-sanitise-stderr</b>
              By default, PSCP will filter control characters from the standard error channel from  the  server,
              to  prevent  remote  processes sending confusing escape sequences. This option forces the standard
              error channel to not be filtered.

       <b>-pwfile</b> <u>filename</u>
              Open the specified file, and use the first line of text read from it as the remote password.

       <b>-pw</b> <u>password</u>
              Set remote password to <u>password</u>. <u>CAUTION:</u> this will likely make  the  password  visible  to  other
              users of the local machine (via commands such as `<b>ps</b>' or `<b>w</b>'). Use <b>-pwfile</b> instead.

       <b>-1</b>     Force use of SSH protocol version 1.

       <b>-2</b>     Force use of SSH protocol version 2.

       <b>-ssh-connection</b>
              Force  use of the `bare <b>ssh-connection</b>' protocol. This is only likely to be useful when connecting
              to a <b>psusan</b>(<u>1</u>) server, most likely with an absolute path to a Unix-domain socket in place of <u>host</u>.

       <b>-ssh</b>   Force use of the SSH protocol. (This is usually not needed; it's only likely to be useful  if  you
              need to override some other configuration of the `bare <b>ssh-connection</b>' protocol.)

       <b>-4</b>, <b>-6</b> Force use of IPv4 or IPv6 for network connections.

       <b>-C</b>     Enable SSH compression.

       <b>-i</b> <u>keyfile</u>
              Private  key  file  for  user authentication. For SSH-2 keys, this key file must be in PuTTY's PPK
              format, not OpenSSH's format or anyone else's.

              If you are using an authentication agent, you can also specify a <u>public</u> key here (in RFC  4716  or
              OpenSSH format), to identify which of the agent's keys to use.

       <b>-noagent</b>
              Don't try to use an authentication agent.

       <b>-agent</b> Allow  use  of  an authentication agent. (This option is only necessary to override a setting in a
              saved session.)

       <b>-no-trivial-auth</b>
              Disconnect from any SSH server which accepts authentication without ever having asked for any kind
              of password or signature or token. (You might want to enable this for a server you  always  expect
              to  challenge  you,  for instance to ensure you don't accidentally type your key file's passphrase
              into a compromised server spoofing PSCP's passphrase prompt.)

       <b>-hostkey</b> <u>key</u>
              Specify an acceptable host public key. This option may be specified multiple times; each  key  can
              be either a fingerprint (<b>SHA256:AbCdE...</b>, <b>99:aa:bb:...</b>, etc) or a base64-encoded blob in OpenSSH's
              one-line format.

              Specifying  this  option overrides automated host key management; <u>only</u> the key(s) specified on the
              command-line will be accepted (unless a saved session also overrides  host  keys,  in  which  case
              those will be added to), and the host key cache will not be written.

       <b>-scp</b>   Force use of SCP protocol.

       <b>-sftp</b>  Force use of SFTP protocol.

       <b>-sshlog</b> <u>logfile</u>

       <b>-sshrawlog</b> <u>logfile</u>
              These  options make <b>pscp</b> log protocol details to a file. (Some of these may be sensitive, although
              by default an effort is made to suppress obvious passwords.)

              <b>-sshlog</b> logs decoded SSH packets  and  other  events  (those  that  <b>-v</b>  would  print).  <b>-sshrawlog</b>
              additionally logs the raw encrypted packet data.

       <b>-logoverwrite</b>
              If PSCP is configured to write to a log file that already exists, discard the existing file.

       <b>-logappend</b>
              If  PSCP  is  configured  to  write  to a log file that already exists, append new log data to the
              existing file.

</pre><h4><b>MORE</b> <b>INFORMATION</b></h4><pre>
       For more information on <b>pscp</b> it's probably best to go and look at the manual on the PuTTY web page:

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       This man page isn't terribly complete. See the above web link for better documentation.
