</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All tools (except for gaps) obey to the -h, --help, -V and --version options as one  would  expect.  This
       help is excellent and makes these man pages basically obsolete.
       <b>combineMUMs</b> Combines MUMs in &lt;GapsFile&gt; by extending matches off ends and between MUMs.  &lt;RefSequence&gt; is
       a  fasta file of the reference sequence.  &lt;MatchSequences&gt; is a multi-fasta file of the sequences matched
       against the reference

         -D      Only output to stdout the difference positions
                 and characters
         -n      Allow matches only between nucleotides, i.e., ACGTs
         -N num  Break matches at &lt;num&gt; or more consecutive non-ACGTs
         -q tag  Used to label query match
         -r tag  Used to label reference match
         -S      Output all differences in strings
         -t      Label query matches with query fasta header
         -v num  Set verbose level for extra output
         -W file Reset the default output filename witherrors.gaps
         -x      Don't output .cover files
         -e      Set error-rate cutoff to e (e.g. 0.02 is two percent)
       <b>dnadiff</b> Run comparative analysis of two sequence sets using nucmer  and  its  associated  utilities  with
       recommended  parameters. See MUMmer documentation for a more detailed description of the output. Produces
       the following output files:

       <b>nuncmer</b>
           nucmer generates nucleotide alignments between two mutli-FASTA input
           files. Two output files are generated. The .cluster output file lists
           clusters of matches between each sequence. The .delta file lists the
           distance between insertions and deletions that produce maximal scoring
           alignments between each sequence.

                         extension reaches the end of a sequence, it will backtrack
                         to optimize the alignment score instead of terminating the
                         alignment at the end of the sequence (default --optimize)
         -p|prefix       Set the prefix of the output files (default "out")
         -r
         --reverse       Use only the reverse complement of the Query sequences

           alignments between each sequence. The DNA input is translated into all 6

                         acids (default 8)

         --coords        Automatically generate the original PROmer1.1 ".coords"
                         output file using the "show-coords" program
         --[no]optimize  Toggle alignment score optimization, i.e. if an alignment
                         extension reaches the end of a sequence, it will backtrack
                         to optimize the alignment score instead of terminating the

         -I float    Set minimum percent identity to display

                     or are less than 75% of the size of the other alignment
                     (promer only)
         -l          Include the sequence length information in the output
         -L long     Set minimum alignment length to display
         -o          Annotate maximal alignments between two sequences, i.e.

         -r          Sort output lines by reference IDs and coordinates
         -T          Switch output to tab-delimited format

         Input is the .delta output of either the "nucmer" or the "promer" program passed on the command line.

         Output is to stdout, and consists of  a  list  of  coordinates,  percent  identity,  and  other  useful
       information regarding the alignment data contained in the .delta file used as input.

         NOTE:  No  sorting  is  done  by  default,  therefore  the  alignments  will be ordered as found in the
       &lt;deltafile&gt; input.
       <b>show-snps</b>
         -C            Do not report SNPs from alignments with an ambiguous
                       mapping, i.e. only report SNPs where the [R] and [Q]

         -H            Do not print the output header
         -I            Do not report indels

                       'show-coords' lines to stdin
         -T            Switch to tab-delimited format
         -x int        Include x characters of surrounding SNP context in the
                       output, default 0

         Input is the .delta output of either the nucmer or promer program passed on the command line.

         Output is to stdout, and consists of a list of SNPs (or  amino  acid  substitutions  for  promer)  with
       positions  and  other  useful  info.  Output will be sorted with -r by default and the [BUFF] column will
       always refer to the sequence whose positions have been sorted. This value  specifies  the  distance  from
       this  SNP  to  the  nearest mismatch (end of alignment, indel, SNP, etc) in the same alignment, while the
       [DIST] column specifies the distance from this SNP to the nearest sequence end. SNPs for  which  the  [R]
       and  [Q] columns are greater than 0 should be evaluated with caution, as these columns specify the number
       of other alignments which overlap this position. Use -C to assure SNPs  are  only  reported  from  unique
       alignment regions.

       <b>show-tiling</b>
         -a          Describe the tiling path by printing the tab-delimited

                     A value of -1 will represent infinity
                     (common default = 1)
         -p file     Output a pseudo molecule of the query contigs to 'file'
         -R          Deal with repetitive contigs by randomly placing them
                     in one of their copy locations (implies -V 0)
         -t file     Output a TIGR style contig list of each query sequence
                     that sufficiently matches the reference (non-circular)
         -u file     Output the tab-delimited alignment region coordinates
                     of the unusable contigs to 'file'
         -v float    Set minimum contig coverage to tile [0.0, 100.0]
                     (nucmer default = 95.0) sum of individual alignments
                     (promer default = 50.0) extent of syntenic region
         -V float    Set minimum contig coverage difference [0.0, 100.0]
                     i.e. the difference needed to determine one alignment
                     is 'better' than another alignment
                     (nucmer default = 10.0) sum of individual alignments
                     (promer default = 30.0) extent of syntenic region
         -x          Describe the tiling path by printing the XML contig
                     linking information to stdout

         Input  is  the  .delta  output  of the nucmer program, run on very similar sequence data, or the .delta
       output of the promer program, run on divergent sequence data.

         Output is to stdout, and consists of the predicted location of each aligning query contig as mapped  to
       the  reference  sequences.   These coordinates reference the extent of the entire query contig, even when
       only a certain percentage of the contig was actually aligned (unless the -a option is used). Columns are,
       start in ref, end in ref, distance to next contig, length of this contig, alignment  coverage,  identity,
       orientation, and ID respectively.
