</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mp3blaster - An interactive text-console based mp3 player.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mp3blaster</b> [<b>options</b>]

       <b>mp3blaster</b> [<b>options</b>]  [<b>file</b> <b>...</b>]
              Play one or more audio files from the command-line

       <b>mp3blaster</b> [<b>options</b>] <b>--list</b><u>|</u><b>-l</b> <b>playlist.lst</b>
              Load a playlist at startup but don't start playing.

       <b>mp3blaster</b> [<b>options</b>] <b>--autolist</b><u>|</u><b>-a</b> <b>playlist.lst</b>
              Load a playlist at startup and start playing.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Mp3blaster</u>  is  an  interactive audio player for the text-console with unique playlist abilities no other
       programs offer. Its interface is at least equally powerful as those  featured  in  GUI  players,  without
       requiring bulky graphical environments.

       The  most  important feature of mp3blaster however is the playlist, which structure is comparable to that
       of a filesystem: Songs (files) can be grouped together in `groups' (directories). With one function,  you
       can  load  all  your  albums  as  groups  into mp3blaster's playlist, so that you can shuffle your albums
       instead of your songs. Of course, you can also load all files into the playlist and  shuffle  them,  just
       like regular players.

       The interface is described in the <b>INTERFACE</b> <b>ELEMENTS</b> section.

       The configuration file is described in the <b>MP3BLASTERRC</b> section.

       The different program modes are described in the <b>PROGRAM</b> <b>MODES</b> section.

       The playlist playback modes are described in the <b>PLAYMODES</b> section.

       Who  coded  this  program?  How  to  report bugs? It's in the <b>AUTHORS</b> and <b>BUGS</b> section at the end of this
       manual.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND-LINE</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--downsample,-2</b>
              Downsample audio to 22Khz (necessary on some ancient soundcards, but it can also be  used  to  use
              less CPU time)

       <b>--8bits,-8</b>
              Convert  audio  to  8bits  (necessary  on 8bit soundcards, but it can also be used to use less CPU
              time)

       <b>--chroot=rootdir,</b> <b>-o=rootdir</b>
              Set &lt;rootdir&gt; as  mp3blaster's  root  dir.  This  affects  <b>ALL</b>  file  operations  in  mp3blaster!!
              (including reading and writing of playlists).  Note that only users with uid 0 (i.e. root) can use
              this  option  (yet).  This  feature  should  be  changed so it won't require root privileges. <b>Only</b>
              <b>install</b> <b>it</b> <b>suid</b> <b>root</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>trust</b> <b>all</b> <b>local</b> <b>users!!!!</b>.

       <b>--config-file,-c=&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Use &lt;file&gt; as config-file instead of <a href="file:~/.mp3blasterrc">~/.mp3blasterrc</a>

       <b>--debug,</b> <b>-d</b>
              Log debug-info in $HOME/.mp3blaster (use this when sending bugreports!)

       <b>--status-file,</b> <b>-f</b>
              Write info on the mp3's being played to the specified file.

       <b>--help,-h</b>
              Gets you this nice list of command-line parameters.

       <b>--mixer-device/-m=&lt;devicename&gt;</b>
              Set the mixer device to use (default = /dev/mixer). For NAS audio mixing, use 'NAS'.   (NOTE:  NAS
              support doesn't work in version 3.0 or above yet)

       <b>--no-mixer,</b> <b>-n</b>
              Don't start the built-in mixer.

       <b>--playmode/-p=(onegroup,allgroups,allrandom}</b>
              Default  playing  mode  is  resp. Play first group only, Play all groups, Play all songs in random
              order.

       <b>--dont-quit,-q</b>
              Don't quit after playing all command-line supplied mp3's (only makes  sense  in  combination  with
              --autolist or files from command-line)

       <b>--repeat/-R</b>
              Repeat the playlist indefinitely.

       <b>--runframes/-r=&lt;number&gt;</b>
              Number  or  frames  to  decode in one loop. Range: 1 to 10 (default=5).  On slow machines, a lower
              number might improve reaction time of the interface, but it's quite unlikely this  will  have  any
              effect from version 3.0 on)

       <b>--sound-device/-s=&lt;devicename&gt;</b>
              Select  the  audio  device  you wish to use for sound playback (default /dev/dsp or /dev/audio for
              OpenBSD). If you want to play over NAS (Network Audio System), give the audioserver's address here
              (usually $DISPLAY, e.g. a host name followed by a colon and a server number, like  bla.foo.com:0).
              (NOTE: NAS support doesn't work in version 3.0 or above yet)

       <b>--threads/-t=&lt;amount&gt;</b>
              Numbers  of threads to use for buffering. Range is 0..500 in increments of 50.  0 threads means no
              buffering (thus no hiccup prevention).

       <b>--version,-v</b>
              Displays mp3blaster's version number.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b> <b>ELEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Since version 3.0, mp3blaster's interface has changed drastically to  make  it  easier  to  use,  without
       losing  functionality.  Press  '?'  to  get  a description of all the commands within mp3blaster. You can
       scroll up and down this helpfile using the cursor keys and pageup/pagedown. To leave the help, press  '?'
       again.

       All  keybindings  mentioned  from  here  on  are the default keybindings.  Most of them can be altered in
       mp3blaster's config file (see section MP3BLASTERRC)

       <b>Keybindings</b> <b>window</b>
              In the top of the screen is the keybindings window. In it you will find all keybindings  that  you
              can  use  in  the  mode  mp3blaster  is in at that time.  If you change modes, the keybindings are
              dynamically updated. To scroll through this window, use '-' and '+'.

       <b>Info</b> <b>window</b>
              This window is located directly beneath the keybindings window. It displays  the  global  playmode
              (see  section  PLAYMODES),  and the next song to be played (if appropriate). Next to it is a small
              window which displays technical information about the current song.

       <b>Main</b> <b>window</b>
              This window is located directly underneath the info window. Its content is usually  determined  by
              the  mode  mp3blaster  is  in  (see  section  PROGRAM MODES).  If you're editing the playlist, the
              playlist is shown. In file manager mode, you will see the directory you're currently in.  In  help
              mode, the help text is being displayed.

       <b>CD-style</b> <b>window</b>
              This  is  the window next to the main window. Here you will find the cd-style controls, as well as
              checkboxes for shuffle/repeat mode. When a song is being played, you  can  see  the  elapsed/total
              time here as well.

       <b>Status</b> <b>window</b>
              It's  underneath  the main window, and displays status information like song title, hints, etc. In
              the top-left, a CD-player style symbol is shown  to  indicate  what  mp3blaster  is  doing  during
              playback.

       <b>Mixer</b> <b>window</b>
              The  mixer  is  right  next  to the status window. Although very compact, it's a full sound mixer.
              Press 't' to toggle between all available mixer devices.  Press '&lt;' and '&gt;'  to  decrease/increase
              the volume of the currently selected mixer device.

</pre><h4><b>PROGRAM</b> <b>MODES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Playlist</b> <b>Editor</b>
              By  default,  mp3blaster  starts  with  the  playlist editor. All keybindings specific to playlist
              editing are listed in the keybindings window.  The playlist consists of one or more  <b>groups</b>.  Each
              group  can  have  its  own <b>groupname</b> and can contain supported audio files. You can toggle shuffle
              mode for each group independently. Many users  will  simply  use  the  single  (root)  group  that
              mp3blaster  starts  with.  In  that case, shuffling all songs is simply a question of toggling the
              GroupShuffle mode (default keybinding: F7).

              If you have multiple groups, and you want to shuffle all songs from all groups, you will  have  to
              set  the global playback mode (see section PLAYMODES). Without shuffling, the songs will be played
              in the order you added them from the file manager. Groups can be nested inside other  groups.  For
              example, you could make a group for each music genre you are interested in. Within each genre, you
              can  add  subgenres,  and  in  the subgenres you can add albums as groups. Starting and stopping a
              playlist can be done with '5' (default keybinding for the Play button). If you stop playback using
              the Stop button, all information about which song has already been played is lost. If you want  to
              stop playback to continue later, pause the current song.
              In  the  main  window, the contents of the currently selected group is shown.  By default, this is
              the 'root' group. Other groups are denoted by square brackets and a purple colour. You  can  enter
              other  groups simply by highlighting them and pressing enter. If you enter the file manager, files
              will be added in the group that was selected in the main window. This even works for playlists; if
              you load a playlist from the file manager (which you always do), it will be added in  the  current
              group! Using this feature, you can merge multiple playlists into one.
              If  you're  listening  to your current playlist, but you want to hear another song in between, you
              can simply do so by highlighting this song (either in playlist mode  or  file  manager  mode)  and
              pressing enter. When the song is finished, the playlist continues with the next song in the list.

       <b>File</b> <b>Manager</b>
              You  can  enter  the file manager by pressing F1 from the <b>playlist</b> <b>editor</b>. The interface is almost
              identical to that of the playlist editor, but you can tell the mode you're in by  looking  at  the
              keybindings  in  the  keybindings window which is automatically updated.  In the file manager, you
              can add files to the group you had currently selected in the <b>playlist</b> <b>editor</b>. You can also  listen
              to  a  file by selecting it with the highlighted bar and pressing enter over it.  Adding files can
              be done in 2 ways: Selecting a file by moving the bar over it and pressing  the  spacebar,  or  by
              recursively  selecting all files in the current directory and all directories in it. If you select
              some files, change to another directory (by pressing enter over one) and  then  select  some  more
              files,  the  old  selection  will  not be lost, even though you can't see it on your screen at the
              time. As soon as you return to the playlist editor by using F1, you will see they have been  added
              to  the group in the order in which you selected them.  However, you can't deselect selected files
              as soon as you change into another directory: you'll have to remove them from the playlist editor.
              A quick way of selecting *all* files in the current directory is to invert  the  selection  (using
              F2) when none are selected. If you want to select all files but one, select the one you don't want
              and then invert the selection.
              The  recursive  selection can be done in two ways: By pressing F3, you add all audiofiles that are
              found in the current directory and all directories in it.  By using F5 (add dirs as groups), mp3's
              are added in groups that are named like the directory the mp3's were in.  This  is  an  ultimately
              fast way of making a playlist grouped by albums!
              Help  for other keybindings can be found inside mp3blaster by pressing '?'  (note that this leaves
              file manager mode!)

       <b>Help</b> <b>mode</b>
              You can get in this mode by pressing '?'. Leave it by pressing '?' again.  It will  always  return
              you to playlist mode.

       <b>Playing</b> <b>Mode</b>
              Mp3blaster  versions  prior to version 3.0 featured another distinctly different mode: the playing
              mode. The reason for this was that it wasn't possible to edit a playlist and  play  mp3's  at  the
              same time. Since this is now possible, playing songs is possible in all program modes. Keybindings
              specific to playback are always listed in the keybindings window.

</pre><h4><b>PLAYMODES</b></h4><pre>
       The  order  in  which files are played in the playlist is determined by two settings: The global playback
       mode (displayed in the info window), and each group's independent shuffle setting. The 'current group' in
       the global playback modes means: The group that is shown in the main window at the time the playlist  was
       started. This is important, since it enables you to play a subsection of your playlist instead of playing
       the entire list.
       These are the global playback modes:

       <b>Play</b> <b>current</b> <b>group,</b> <b>including</b> <b>subgroups</b>
              Plays  all  songs  shown  in  the current group, as well as all songs in all subgroups. First, all
              groups will be played in the order you have added them (unless  the  current  group's  shuffle  is
              enabled,  then  the  order  is  randomly  determined). Then, the songs in the group itself will be
              played.  You can determine for each individual group whether you want to shuffle the songs in them
              or not, by enabling the group's shuffle setting.

       <b>Play</b> <b>current</b> <b>group,</b> <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>its</b> <b>subgroups</b>
              This is essentially the same as the previous mode, except that subgroups in  this  group  will  be
              skipped.

       <b>Shuffle</b> <b>all</b> <b>songs</b> <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>groups</b>
              This  is comparable to the 'shuffle' mode that all players support: It ignores the group structure
              totally, and simply shuffles all songs in a completely random order.

</pre><h4><b>MP3BLASTERRC</b></h4><pre>
       You can store many settings and keybindings in a config  file.  By  default,  mp3blaster  will  look  for
       <a href="file:~/.mp3blasterrc">~/.mp3blasterrc</a>, unless you specify another file on the command-line (using -c/--config-file).

       The  structure of the config file is pretty straightforward. Look at sample.mp3blasterrc in your share or
       share/doc directory for a quick example.  Lines starting with a '#' are ignored. You can use them to  put
       comments on.  All other lines consist of a keyword/value pair like this:

       <b>Keyword</b> = <b>Value</b>

       Some keywords can have multiple values, in that case it's:

       <b>Keyword</b> = <b>Value1</b>, <b>Value2</b>

       Escape  comma's  in  a value with a backslash (). If you want a literal backslash, escape it with another
       backslash (\). Keywords are case-sensitive.

       There are a few types of values: numbers, booleans,  keybindings,  colours,  and  everything  else  is  a
       string. The syntax of these types are:

       <b>numbers</b>
              Numerical values, in decimal notation.

       <b>booleans</b>
              yes/no, 1/0, or true/false (case-insensitive)

       <b>keybindings</b>
              Single-character  keybindings  represent themselves. If you want to specify a scancode, the syntax
              is 's&lt;hex-digit&gt;&lt;hex-digit&gt;'. All  others  are  special  canonical  names:  '<b>spc</b>'  (space),  '<b>ent</b>'
              (enter),  '<b>kp0</b>'..'<b>kp9</b>'  (keypad  0..9), '<b>ins</b>' (insert), '<b>hom</b>' (home), '<b>del</b>' (delete), '<b>end</b>' (end),
              '<b>pup</b>'  (pageup),  '<b>pdn</b>'  (pagedown),  '<b>f1</b>'..'<b>f12</b>',  '<b>up</b>'/'<b>dwn</b>'/'<b>lft</b>'/'<b>rig</b>'  (cursor  keys),  '<b>bsp</b>'
              (backspace).

       <b>colours</b>
              One of: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white

       These keywords are currently supported:

       <b>AudioDriver</b> (string)
              Which  audiodriver  to  use for playback. Currently, you can choose between the following drivers:
              <b>oss</b>, <b>esd</b>, <b>nas</b> and <b>sdl</b>. If SDL is  available,  it  will  be  used  by  default.  OSS  is  the  next
              alternative. ESD should only be used if everything else fails.  Note that, if you use SDL as audio
              driver,   you   can   select  from  many  output  devices  by  setting  the  environment  variable
              <b>SDL_AUDIODRIVER</b>. This is an  SDL  feature,  please  refer  to  the  FAQ  on  libsdl.org  for  more
              information.

       <b>AudiofileMatching</b> (list of strings)
              List of file patterns (in regexp format) that determines which files will be considered audiofiles
              (default:  all  files ending on .mp3, .wav, and files starting with 'http://' for http streaming).
              Check sample.mp3blasterrc for a good example.

       <b>CharsetTable</b> (string)
              Specify a character recoding table which maps ID3 songinfo to your local charset.  For  more  info
              about  how  to  create  one,  see  the  README  in the installed mp3blaster documentation (usually
              /usr/local/share/mp3blaster) for more information. An example which recodes  the  Russian  win1251
              charset to the koi8-r charset is included.

       <b>DownFrequency</b> (boolean)
              If  true, downsample audio output to 22Khz instead of 44Khz (necessary on some ancient soundcards,
              like genuine Soundblaster Pro's)

       <b>File.ID3Names</b> (boolean)
              If enabled, the display mode in the file manager will show mp3's  by  their  ID3-tag  by  default,
              instead  of  their  filename. (default: disabled) (TODO: Make this directive a string with printf-
              like format for the id3tag fields).

       <b>File.SortMode</b> (string)
              Determines the default file sorting mode for the file manager. Valid modes are:  <b>alpha</b>  (default),
              <b>alpha-case</b>, <b>modify-new,</b> <b>modify-old</b>, <b>size-small</b>, <b>size-big</b>, <b>none</b>.

       <b>HideOtherFiles</b> (boolean)
              If enabled, non-audio/playlist files will not be shown in the file manager.

       <b>MixerDevice</b> <b>(string)</b>
              Mixer device to use for mixing (default: /dev/mixer).

       <b>PlaylistDir</b> (string)
              Directory path where playlists are stored (default: <a href="file:~/.mp3blaster_playlists">~/.mp3blaster_playlists</a>)

       <b>PlaylistMatching</b> (list of strings)
              List  of  file  patterns  (in  regexp  format) that determine which files are considered playlists
              (default: all files ending on .lst/.m3u). Syntax identical to that of <b>AudiofileMatching</b>.

       <b>ScanMP3</b> (boolean)
              If set, it will read each mp3 file before playing, to calculate VBR  total  time.  This  might  be
              impractical  if mp3's are streamed over a slow network connection, because the entire file will be
              read. Scanning is unnecessary if the mp3 has a so-called XING header (which most VBR  mp3's  have,
              nowadays).  Default: disabled.

       <b>SelectItems.UnselectFirst</b> (boolean)
              When  selecting  files  from  the  filemanager  or  playlist  using  'Select some items', unselect
              previously selected items prior to selecting matching new ones if this option  is  set.  (default:
              disabled)

       <b>SelectItems.SearchRegex</b> (boolean)
              If set, use extended regular expression to match files instead of using the global (fnmatch-style)
              matching. This is for the 'Select some items' feature.  (default: disabled)

       <b>SelectItems.SearchCaseInsensitive</b> (boolean)
