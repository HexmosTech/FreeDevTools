</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mr</b> is a tool to manage all your version control repos. It can checkout, update, or perform other actions
       on a set of repositories as if they were one combined repository. It supports any combination of
       Subversion, git, cvs, mercurial, bzr, darcs, fossil and veracity repositories, and support for other
       version control systems can easily be added.

       <b>mr</b> cds into and operates on all registered repositories at or below your working directory. Or, if you
       are in a subdirectory of a repository that contains no other registered repositories, it will stay in
       that directory, and work on only that repository,

       <b>mr</b> is configured by .mrconfig files, which list the repositories. It starts by reading the .mrconfig file
       in your home directory, and this can in turn chain load .mrconfig files from repositories. It also
       automatically looks for a .mrconfig file in the current directory, or in one of its parent directories.

       These predefined commands should be fairly familiar to users of any version control system:

       checkout (or co)
           Checks out any repositories that are not already checked out.

       update
           Updates each repository from its configured remote repository.

           If a repository isn't checked out yet, it will first check it out.

       status
           Displays  a  status  report  for each repository, showing what uncommitted changes are present in the
           repository. For distributed version control systems, also shows unpushed local branches.

       clean
           Print ignored files, untracked files and other cruft in the working directory.

           The optional -f parameter allows removing the files as well as printing them.

       commit (or ci)
           Commits changes to each repository. (By default, changes are pushed to  the  remote  repository  too,
           when  using  distributed  systems like git. If you don't like this default, you can change it in your
           .mrconfig, or use record instead.)

           The optional -m parameter allows specifying a commit message.

       record
           Records changes to the local repository, but does not  push  them  to  the  remote  repository.  Only
           supported for distributed version control systems.

           The optional -m parameter allows specifying a commit message.

       fetch
           Fetches  from  each  repository's  remote  repository,  but  does  not  update the working copy. Only
           supported for some distributed version control systems.

       push
           Pushes committed local changes to the remote repository. A  no-op  for  centralized  version  control
           systems.

       diff
           Show a diff of uncommitted changes.

       log Show the commit log.

       grep pattern
           Searches for a pattern in each repository using the grep subcommand. Uses ack or ack-grep on VCS that
           do  not  have  their  own.  Ignores the return value from grep subcommands so that you can use "mr -m
           grep foo" and not get output in non-matching repositories.

       run command [param ...]
           Runs the specified command in each repository.

       These commands are also available:

       bootstrap src [directory]
           Causes mr to retrieve the source "src" and use it as a .mrconfig file to  checkout  the  repositories
           listed in it, into the specified directory.

           <b>mr</b> understands several types of sources:

           URL for curl
               "src" may be an URL understood by <b>curl</b>.

           copy via ssh
               To use <b>scp</b> to download, the "src" may have the form "ssh://[user@]host:file".

           local file
               You can retrieve the config file by other means and pass its <b>path</b> as "src".

           standard input
               If source "src" consists in a single dash "-", config file is read from standard input.

           The  directory  will  be  created  if  it  does  not exist. If no directory is specified, the current
           directory will be used.

           As a special case, if source "src" includes a repository named ".", that is checked out into the  top
           of the specified directory.

       list (or ls)
           List the repositories that mr will act on.

       register
           Register  an  existing  repository  in  a  mrconfig  file.  By default, the repository in the current
           directory is registered, or you can specify a directory to register.

           The mrconfig file that is modified is chosen by either the -c option, or by looking for  the  closest
           known one at or in a parent of the current directory.

       config
           Adds,  modifies,  removes,  or prints a value from a mrconfig file. The next parameter is the name of
           the section the value is in. To add or modify values, use one or more instances  of  "setting=value".
           Use "setting=" to remove a setting. Use just "setting" to get the value of a that setting.

           For example, to add (or edit) a repository in src/foo:

             mr config src/foo checkout="svn co svn://example.com/foo/trunk foo"

           To show the command that mr uses to update the repository in src/foo:

             mr config src/foo update

           To see the built-in library of shell functions contained in mr:

             mr config DEFAULT lib

           The mrconfig file that is used is chosen by either the -c option, or by looking for the closest known
           one at or in a parent of the current directory.

       offline
           Advises mr that it is in offline mode. Any commands that fail in offline mode will be remembered, and
           retried when mr is told it's online.

       online
           Advices  mr  that  it is in online mode again. Commands that failed while in offline mode will be re-
           run.

       remember
           Remember a command, to be run later when mr re-enters online  mode.  This  implicitly  puts  mr  into
           offline  mode. The command can be any regular mr command. This is useful when you know that a command
           will fail due to being offline, and so don't want to run it right now at all, but  just  remember  to
           run it when you go back online.

       help
           Displays this help.

       Actions can be abbreviated to any unambiguous substring, so "mr st" is equivalent to "mr status", and "mr
       up" is equivalent to "mr update"

       Additional  parameters  can  be  passed  to  most commands, and are passed on unchanged to the underlying
       version control system. This is mostly useful if the repositories mr will act on all use the same version
       control system.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -d directory
       --directory directory
           Specifies the topmost directory that <b>mr</b> should work in. The default is the current working directory.

       -c mrconfig
       --config mrconfig
           Use the specified mrconfig file. The default is to use  both  <u><a href="file:~/.mrconfig">~/.mrconfig</a></u>  as  well  as  look  for  a
           <u>.mrconfig</u> file in the current directory, or in one of its parent directories.

       -f
       --force
           Force mr to act on repositories that would normally be skipped due to their configuration.

       --force-env
           Force mr to execute even though potentially dangerous environment variables are set.

       -v
       --verbose
           Be verbose.

       -m
       --minimal
           Minimise output. If a command fails or there is any output then the usual output will be shown.

       -q
       --quiet
           Be  quiet.  This  suppresses  mr's  usual  output,  as  well as any output from commands that are run
           (including stderr output). If a command fails, the output will be shown.

       -k
       --insecure
           Accept untrusted SSL certificates when bootstrapping.

       -s
       --stats
           Expand the statistics  line  displayed  at  the  end  to  include  information  about  exactly  which
           repositories failed and were skipped, if any.

       -i
       --interactive
           Interactive mode. If a repository fails to be processed, a subshell will be started which you can use
           to resolve or investigate the problem. Exit the subshell to continue the mr run.

       -n [number]
       --no-recurse [number]
           If  no  number if specified, just operate on the repository for the current directory, do not recurse
           into deeper repositories.

           If a number is specified, will recurse into repositories at most that many subdirectories  deep.  For
           example, with -n 2 it would recurse into ./src/foo, but not ./src/packages/bar.

       -j [number]
       --jobs [number]
           Run  the  specified  number  of  jobs  in  parallel,  or  an  unlimited number of jobs with no number
           specified. This can greatly speed  up  operations  such  as  updates.   It  is  not  recommended  for
           interactive operations.

           Note  that  running  more  than  10  jobs  at a time is likely to run afoul of ssh connection limits.
           Running between 3 and 5 jobs at a time will yield a good  speedup  in  updates  without  loading  the
           machine too much.

       --cache
           Saves the command output and return values to files in the <u><a href="file:~/.mrcache/">~/.mrcache/</a></u> directory tree after executing
           each command.

           Ignored when being run from subdirs of a repo unless --top is enabled.

           This is used by the "cache-mr-status.sh" shell extension.

       --cached
           For  repos  where the cache is populated, prints the cached output instead of executing the commands.
           For repos with an unpopulated cache, executes the commands and stores output into the cache.

           Ignored when being run from subdirs of a repo unless --top is enabled.

           This is most useful when the "cache-mr-status.sh" shell extension is enabled.

       --uncache
           For repos where the cache is populated, remove the cached output before executing any commands.

           This may be useful to users of the "cache-mr-status.sh" shell extension.

       --top
           When being run from subdirs of a repo, change directory to the top of the  repo  before  running  any
           commands.

           This is used by the "cache-mr-status.sh" shell extension.

       -t
       --trust-all
           Trust all mrconfig files even if they are not listed in <u><a href="file:~/.mrtrust">~/.mrtrust</a></u>.  Use with caution.

       -p
       --path
           This obsolete flag is ignored.

</pre><h4><b>MRCONFIG</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Here is an example <u>.mrconfig</u> file:

         [src]
         checkout = svn checkout svn://svn.example.com/src/trunk src
         chain = true

         [src/linux-2.6]
         checkout = git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git &amp;&amp;
               cd linux-2.6 &amp;&amp;
               git checkout -b mybranch origin/master

       The  <u>.mrconfig</u>  file  uses a variant of the INI file format. Lines starting with "#" are comments. Values
       can be continued to the following line by indenting the line with whitespace.

       The "DEFAULT" section allows setting default values for the sections that come after it.

       The "ALIAS" section allows adding aliases for actions. Each setting is an alias, and  its  value  is  the
       action to use.

       All  other  sections add repositories. The section header specifies the directory where the repository is
       located. This is relative to the directory that contains the mrconfig file, but you can  also  choose  to
       use  absolute  paths.  (Note that you can use environment variables in section names; they will be passed
       through the shell for expansion. For example, "[$HOSTNAME]", or "[${HOSTNAME}foo]").

       Within a section, each setting defines a shell command to run to  handle  a  given  action.  mr  contains
       default handlers for "update", "status", "commit", and other standard actions.

       Normally you only need to specify what to do for "checkout". Here you specify the command to run in order
       to create a checkout of the repository.  The command will be run in the parent directory, and must create
       the  repository's  directory.  So  use "git clone", "svn checkout", "bzr branch" or "bzr checkout" (for a
       bound branch), etc.

       Note that these shell commands are run in a "set -e" shell environment, where any  additional  parameters
       you  pass  are  available in $@. All commands other than "checkout" are run inside the repository, though
       not necessarily at the top of it.

       The "MR_REPO" environment variable is set to the path to the top of the repository. (For  the  "register"
       action,  "MR_REPO"  is  instead set to the basename of the directory that should be created when checking
       the repository out.)

       The "MR_CONFIG" environment variable is set to the .mrconfig file that defines the repo being  acted  on,
       or,  if  the repo is not yet in a config file, the <u>.mrconfig</u> file that should be modified to register the
       repo.

       The "MR_ACTION" environment variable is set to the command being run (update, checkout, etc).

       A few settings have special meanings:

       skip
           If "skip" is set and its command returns true, then <b>mr</b> will  skip  acting  on  that  repository.  The
           command is passed the action name in $1.

           Here  are  two  examples.  The  first  skips  the  repo unless mr is run by joey. The second uses the
           hours_since function (included in mr's built-in library) to skip updating the repo unless  it's  been
           at least 12 hours since the last update.

             [mystuff]
             checkout = ...
             skip = test `whoami` != joey

             [linux]
             checkout = ...
             skip = [ "$1" = update ] &amp;&amp; ! hours_since "$1" 12

           Another  way  to  use  skip  is for a lazy checkout. This makes mr skip operating on a repo unless it
           already exists. To enable the repo, you have to explicitly check it out (using  "mr  --force  -d  foo
           checkout").

             [foo]
             checkout = ...
             skip = lazy

       order
           The  "order"  setting can be used to override the default ordering of repositories. The default order
           value is 10. Use smaller values to make repositories be processed earlier, and larger values to  make
           repositories be processed later.

           Note  that  if  a  repository  is  located in a subdirectory of another repository, ordering it to be
           processed earlier is not recommended.

       chain
           If "chain" is set and its command returns true, then <b>mr</b> will try to load a <u>.mrconfig</u>  file  from  the
           root of the repository.

       include
           If  "include"  is  set,  its  command is ran, and should output additional mrconfig file content. The
           content is included as if it were part of the including file.

           Unlike everything else, "include" does not need to be placed within a section.

           <b>mr</b> ships several libraries that can be included to add support for additional  version  control  type
           things (unison, git-svn, git-fake-bare, git-subtree). To include them all, you could use:

             include = cat /usr/share/mr/*

           See the individual files for details.

       deleted
           If  "deleted"  is  set and its command returns true, then <b>mr</b> will treat the repository as deleted. It
           won't ever actually delete the repository, but it will warn if it sees  the  repository's  directory.
           This  is  useful  when  one  mrconfig  file  is  shared among multiple machines, to keep track of and
           remember to delete old repositories.

       lib The "lib" setting can contain some shell code that will be run before each command,  this  can  be  a
           useful way to define shell functions for other commands to use.

           Unlike  most  other settings, this can be specified multiple times, in which case the chunks of shell
           code are accumulatively concatenated together.

       fixups
           If "fixups" is set, its command is run whenever  a  repository  is  checked  out,  or  updated.  This
           provides an easy way to do things like permissions fixups, or other tweaks to the repository content,
           whenever the repository is changed.

       jobs
           If "jobs" is set, run the specified number of jobs in parallel.  This can greatly speed up operations
           such as updates.

           Note  that  running  more  than  10  jobs  at a time is likely to run afoul of ssh connection limits.
           Running between 3 and 5 jobs at a time will yield a good  speedup  in  updates  without  loading  the
           machine too much.

       VCS_action
           When looking for a command to run for a given action, mr first looks for a setting with the same name
           as  the  action. If that is not found, it looks for a setting named "VCS_action" (substituting in the
           name of the version control system and the action). If that is not found,  it  looks  for  a  setting
           named "action_default" (substituting in the name of the action).

           Internally,  mr  has  settings  for  "git_update",  "svn_update",  etc.  To change the action that is
           performed for a given version control system, you can override these VCS specific actions. To  add  a
           new version control system, you can just add VCS specific actions for it.

       pre_ and post_
           If  "pre_action"  is  set,  its  command  is  run before mr performs the specified action. Similarly,
           "post_action" commands are run after mr successfully performs  the  specified  action.  For  example,
           "pre_commit" is run before committing; "post_update" is run after updating.

       _prepend
           Any  setting can be suffixed with "_prepend", to prepend an additional value to the existing value of
           the setting. A line ending is added between the additional value and the existing value. In this way,
           actions can be constructed accumulatively.

           This is useful for applying modifier commands such as nice, ionice or  nocache.   To  apply  modifier
           commands,  ensure  you end this suffix with a shell line continuation character (the backslash "\" in
           most shells) so that the line ending added by this suffix is ignored.

       _append
           Any setting can be suffixed with "_append", to append an additional value to the  existing  value  of
           the  setting. Line endings are added at the end of the existing value and after the additional value.
           In this way, actions can be constructed accumulatively.

       _default
           Any setting can be suffixed with "_default", to set the value for the  setting  when  a  VCS-specific
           setting cannot be found. This is mostly for making actions do nothing for most VCS actions by setting
           action_default to "true" and then setting the action for each VCS that has the action.

           This is used by the mr "upgrade" extension.

       VCS_test
           The  name  of  the  version  control  system  is itself determined by running each defined "VCS_test"
           action, until one succeeds.

</pre><h4><b>UNTRUSTED</b> <b>MRCONFIG</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Since mrconfig files can contain arbitrary shell commands, they can  do  anything.  This  flexibility  is
       good, but it also allows a malicious mrconfig file to delete your whole home directory. Such a file might
       be  contained  inside  a  repository  that  your main <u><a href="file:~/.mrconfig">~/.mrconfig</a></u> checks out. To avoid worries about evil
       commands in a mrconfig file, mr defaults to reading all mrconfig files other than the main <u><a href="file:~/.mrconfig">~/.mrconfig</a></u> in
       untrusted mode. In untrusted mode, mrconfig files are limited to running only known safe  commands  (like
       "git clone") in a carefully checked manner.

       To  configure  mr  to  trust  other mrconfig files, list them in <u><a href="file:~/.mrtrust">~/.mrtrust</a></u>.  One mrconfig file should be
       listed per line. Either the full pathname should be listed, or the pathname can start with <u>~/</u> to  specify
       a file relative to your home directory.

</pre><h4><b>OFFLINE</b> <b>LOG</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u><a href="file:~/.mrlog">~/.mrlog</a></u>  file  contains commands that mr has remembered to run later, due to being offline. You can
       delete or edit this file to remove commands, or even to add other commands for 'mr online' to run. If the
       file is present, mr assumes it is in offline mode.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       mr can be extended to support things such as unison and git-svn. Some files providing such extensions are
       available in <u>/usr/share/mr/</u>.  Some files providing mr shell extensions are in <u>/usr/share/mr.sh/</u>.  See the
       documentation in the files for details about using them.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       mr returns nonzero if a command failed in any of the repositories.
