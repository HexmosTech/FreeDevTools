</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>cmake</b>  executable  is  the command-line interface of the cross-platform buildsystem generator CMake.
       The above <u>Synopsis</u> lists various actions the tool can perform as described in sections below.

       To build a software project with CMake, <u>Generate</u> <u>a</u> <u>Project</u> <u>Buildsystem</u>.  Optionally use <b>cmake</b> to <u>Build</u>  <u>a</u>
       <u>Project</u>, <u>Install</u> <u>a</u> <u>Project</u> or just run the corresponding build tool (e.g. <b>make</b>) directly.  <b>cmake</b> can also
       be used to <u>View</u> <u>Help</u>.

       The  other  actions  are  meant  for  use by software developers writing scripts in the <u>CMake</u> <u>language</u> to
       support their builds.

       For graphical user interfaces that may be used  in  place  of  <b>cmake</b>,  see  <u>ccmake</u>  and  <u>cmake-gui</u>.   For
       command-line interfaces to the CMake testing and packaging facilities, see <u>ctest</u> and <u>cpack</u>.

       For more information on CMake at large, <u>see</u> <u>also</u> the links at the end of this manual.

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b> <b>TO</b> <b>CMAKE</b> <b>BUILDSYSTEMS</b></h4><pre>
       A  <u>buildsystem</u>  describes how to build a project's executables and libraries from its source code using a
       <u>build</u> <u>tool</u> to automate the process.  For example, a  buildsystem  may  be  a  <b>Makefile</b>  for  use  with  a
       command-line  <b>make</b>  tool  or a project file for an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).  In order to
       avoid maintaining multiple such buildsystems, a project may  specify  its  buildsystem  abstractly  using
       files  written  in  the <u>CMake</u> <u>language</u>.  From these files CMake generates a preferred buildsystem locally
       for each user through a backend called a <u>generator</u>.

       To generate a buildsystem with CMake, the following must be selected:

       <b>Source</b> <b>Tree</b>
              The top-level directory containing source files provided by the project.   The  project  specifies
              its  buildsystem  using  files  as  described  in  the  <u><a href="../man7/cmake-language.7.html">cmake-language</a>(7)</u>  manual, starting with a
              top-level file named <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>.  These files specify build targets and their dependencies  as
              described in the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-buildsystem.7.html">cmake-buildsystem</a>(7)</u> manual.

       <b>Build</b> <b>Tree</b>
              The  top-level  directory  in which buildsystem files and build output artifacts (e.g. executables
              and libraries) are to be stored.  CMake will write a <b>CMakeCache.txt</b> file to identify the directory
              as a build tree and store persistent information such as buildsystem configuration options.

              To maintain a pristine source tree, perform an <u>out-of-source</u> build by using a  separate  dedicated
              build  tree.   An  <u>in-source</u>  build in which the build tree is placed in the same directory as the
              source tree is also supported, but discouraged.

       <b>Generator</b>
              This chooses the kind  of  buildsystem  to  generate.   See  the  <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generators.7.html">cmake-generators</a>(7)</u>  manual  for
              documentation  of all generators.  Run <u>cmake</u> <u>--help</u> to see a list of generators available locally.
              Optionally use the <u>-G</u> option below to specify a generator, or  simply  accept  the  default  CMake
              chooses for the current platform.

              When using one of the <u>Command-Line</u> <u>Build</u> <u>Tool</u> <u>Generators</u> CMake expects that the environment needed
              by  the  compiler  toolchain  is already configured in the shell.  When using one of the <u>IDE</u> <u>Build</u>
              <u>Tool</u> <u>Generators</u>, no particular environment is needed.

</pre><h4><b>GENERATE</b> <b>A</b> <b>PROJECT</b> <b>BUILDSYSTEM</b></h4><pre>
       Run CMake with one of the following command signatures to specify the source and build trees and generate
       a buildsystem:

       <b>cmake</b> <b>[&lt;options&gt;]</b> <b>-B</b> <b>&lt;path-to-build&gt;</b> <b>[-S</b> <b>&lt;path-to-source&gt;]</b>
          Added in version 3.13.

          Uses <b>&lt;path-to-build&gt;</b> as the build tree and <b>&lt;path-to-source&gt;</b> as the source tree.  The  specified  paths
          may  be  absolute  or  relative  to  the  current  working  directory.  The source tree must contain a
          <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> file.  The build tree will be created automatically if it does not already exist.   For
          example:

              $ cmake -S src -B build

       <b>cmake</b> <b>[&lt;options&gt;]</b> <b>&lt;path-to-source&gt;</b>
              Uses  the  current  working  directory as the build tree, and <b>&lt;path-to-source&gt;</b> as the source tree.
              The specified path may be absolute or relative to the current working directory.  The source  tree
              must  contain  a <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> file and must <u>not</u> contain a <b>CMakeCache.txt</b> file because the latter
              identifies an existing build tree.  For example:

                 $ mkdir build ; cd build
                 $ cmake ../src

       <b>cmake</b> <b>[&lt;options&gt;]</b> <b>&lt;path-to-existing-build&gt;</b>
              Uses <b>&lt;path-to-existing-build&gt;</b> as the build tree, and loads the path to the source  tree  from  its
              <b>CMakeCache.txt</b>  file,  which  must  have  already  been generated by a previous run of CMake.  The
              specified path may be absolute or relative to the current working directory.  For example:

                 $ cd build
                 $ cmake .

       In all cases the <b>&lt;options&gt;</b> may be zero or more of the <u>Options</u> below.

       The above styles for specifying the source and build trees may be mixed.  Paths specified with <u>-S</u>  or  <u>-B</u>
       are  always  classified as source or build trees, respectively.  Paths specified with plain arguments are
       classified based on their content and the types of paths given earlier.  If only  one  type  of  path  is
       given, the current working directory (cwd) is used for the other.  For example:
                                 ┌────────────────────────┬────────────┬───────────┐

       Changed  in  version  3.23:  CMake  warns  when multiple source paths are specified.  This has never been
       officially documented or supported, but older versions accidentally accepted multiple  source  paths  and
       used the last path specified.  Avoid passing multiple source path arguments.

       After generating a buildsystem one may use the corresponding native build tool to build the project.  For
       example, after using the <u>Unix</u> <u>Makefiles</u> generator one may run <b>make</b> directly:

              $ make
              $ make install

       Alternatively,  one  may  use  <b>cmake</b>  to  <u>Build</u>  <u>a</u>  <u>Project</u>  by  automatically  choosing and invoking the
       appropriate native build tool.

   <b>Options</b>
       <b>-S</b> <b>&lt;path-to-source&gt;</b>
              Path to root directory of the CMake project to build.

       <b>-B</b> <b>&lt;path-to-build&gt;</b>
              Path to directory which CMake will use as the root of build directory.

              If the directory doesn't already exist CMake will make it.

       <b>-C</b> <b>&lt;initial-cache&gt;</b>
              Pre-load a script to populate the cache.

              When CMake is first run in an empty build tree, it creates a <b>CMakeCache.txt</b> file and populates  it
              with  customizable settings for the project.  This option may be used to specify a file from which
              to load cache entries before the first pass through the project's  CMake  listfiles.   The  loaded
              entries  take priority over the project's default values.  The given file should be a CMake script
              containing <u>set()</u> commands that use the <b>CACHE</b> option, not a cache-format file.

              References to <u>CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR</u> and <u>CMAKE_BINARY_DIR</u> within the script evaluate  to  the  top-level
              source and build tree.

       <b>-D</b> <b>&lt;var&gt;:&lt;type&gt;=&lt;value&gt;,</b> <b>-D</b> <b>&lt;var&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Create or update a CMake <b>CACHE</b> entry.

              When  CMake is first run in an empty build tree, it creates a <b>CMakeCache.txt</b> file and populates it
              with customizable settings for the project.  This option may be used to  specify  a  setting  that
              takes  priority  over  the  project's default value.  The option may be repeated for as many <b>CACHE</b>
              entries as desired.

              If the <b>:&lt;type&gt;</b> portion is given it must be one  of  the  types  specified  by  the  <u>set()</u>  command
              documentation  for  its  <b>CACHE</b>  signature.   If  the  <b>:&lt;type&gt;</b> portion is omitted the entry will be
              created with no type if it does not exist with a type already.  If a command in the  project  sets
              the type to <b>PATH</b> or <b>FILEPATH</b> then the <b>&lt;value&gt;</b> will be converted to an absolute path.

              This option may also be given as a single argument: <b>-D&lt;var&gt;:&lt;type&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</b> or <b>-D&lt;var&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</b>.

              It's  important to note that the order of <b>-C</b> and <b>-D</b> arguments is significant. They will be carried
              out in the order they are listed, with the last argument taking precedence over the previous ones.
              For example, if you specify <b>-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug</b>, followed by a <b>-C</b> argument with a  file  that
              calls:

                 set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE "Release" CACHE STRING "" FORCE)

              then  the  <b>-C</b> argument will take precedence, and <b>CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE</b> will be set to <b>Release</b>. However,
              if the <b>-D</b> argument comes after the <b>-C</b> argument, it will be set to <b>Debug</b>.

              If a <b>set(...</b> <b>CACHE</b> <b>...)</b> call in the <b>-C</b> file does not use <b>FORCE</b>, and a <b>-D</b> argument  sets  the  same
              variable,  the  <b>-D</b>  argument  will  take  precedence  regardless of order because of the nature of
              non-<b>FORCE</b> <b>set(...</b> <b>CACHE</b> <b>...)</b> calls.

       <b>-U</b> <b>&lt;globbing_expr&gt;</b>
              Remove matching entries from CMake <b>CACHE</b>.

              This option may be used to remove one or more variables from  the  <b>CMakeCache.txt</b>  file,  globbing
              expressions  using <b>*</b> and <b>?</b> are supported.  The option may be repeated for as many <b>CACHE</b> entries as
              desired.

              Use with care, you can make your <b>CMakeCache.txt</b> non-working.

       <b>-G</b> <b>&lt;generator-name&gt;</b>
              Specify a build system generator.

              CMake may support multiple native build systems on certain platforms.  A generator is  responsible
              for  generating  a  particular  build  system.   Possible  generator  names  are  specified in the
              <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generators.7.html">cmake-generators</a>(7)</u> manual.

              If not specified, CMake checks the <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR</u> environment variable and otherwise  falls  back
              to a builtin default selection.

       <b>-T</b> <b>&lt;toolset-spec&gt;</b>
              Toolset specification for the generator, if supported.

              Some  CMake  generators  support  a  toolset  specification to tell the native build system how to
              choose a compiler.  See the <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET</u> variable for details.

       <b>-A</b> <b>&lt;platform-name&gt;</b>
              Specify platform name if supported by generator.

              Some CMake generators support a platform name to be given to the native build system to  choose  a
              compiler or SDK.  See the <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM</u> variable for details.

       <b>--toolchain</b> <b>&lt;path-to-file&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.21.

              Specify  the  cross compiling toolchain file, equivalent to setting <u>CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE</u> variable.
              Relative paths are interpreted as relative to the build directory, and if not found,  relative  to
              the source directory.

       <b>--install-prefix</b> <b>&lt;directory&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.21.

              Specify the installation directory, used by the <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u> variable. Must be an absolute
              path.

       <b>-Wno-dev</b>
              Suppress developer warnings.

              Suppress  warnings that are meant for the author of the <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> files. By default this will
              also turn off deprecation warnings.

       <b>-Wdev</b>  Enable developer warnings.

              Enable warnings that are meant for the author of the <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> files. By  default  this  will
              also turn on deprecation warnings.

       <b>-Wdeprecated</b>
              Enable deprecated functionality warnings.

              Enable  warnings  for  usage  of  deprecated  functionality,  that are meant for the author of the
              <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> files.

       <b>-Wno-deprecated</b>
              Suppress deprecated functionality warnings.

              Suppress warnings for usage of deprecated functionality, that are meant  for  the  author  of  the
              <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> files.

       <b>-Werror=&lt;what&gt;</b>
              Treat CMake warnings as errors. <b>&lt;what&gt;</b> must be one of the following:

              <b>dev</b>    Make developer warnings errors.

                     Make  warnings that are meant for the author of the <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> files errors. By default
                     this will also turn on deprecated warnings as errors.

              <b>deprecated</b>
                     Make deprecated macro and function warnings errors.

                     Make warnings for usage of deprecated macros and functions, that are meant for  the  author
                     of the <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> files, errors.

       <b>-Wno-error=&lt;what&gt;</b>
              Do not treat CMake warnings as errors. <b>&lt;what&gt;</b> must be one of the following:

              <b>dev</b>    Make  warnings  that  are  meant  for the author of the <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> files not errors. By
                     default this will also turn off deprecated warnings as errors.

              <b>deprecated</b>
                     Make warnings for usage of deprecated macros and functions, that are meant for  the  author
                     of the <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> files, not errors.

       <b>--fresh</b>
              Added in version 3.24.

              Perform  a  fresh  configuration of the build tree.  This removes any existing <b>CMakeCache.txt</b> file
              and associated <b>CMakeFiles/</b> directory, and recreates them from scratch.

              Changed in version 3.30: For dependencies  previously  populated  by  <u>FetchContent</u>  with  the  <b>NEW</b>
              setting  for  policy  <u>CMP0168</u>, their stamp and script files from any previous run will be removed.
              The download, update, and patch steps will therefore be forced to re-execute.

       <b>-L[A][H]</b>
              List non-advanced cached variables.

              List <b>CACHE</b> variables will run CMake and list all the variables from the CMake <b>CACHE</b> that  are  not
              marked  as  <b>INTERNAL</b> or <u>ADVANCED</u>.  This will effectively display current CMake settings, which can
              then be changed with <u>-D</u> option.  Changing some of the variables may result in more variables being
              created.  If <b>A</b> is specified, then it will display also advanced variables.  If <b>H</b> is specified,  it
              will also display help for each variable.

       <b>-LR[A][H]</b> <b>&lt;regex&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.31.

              Show specific non-advanced cached variables

              Show  non-<b>INTERNAL</b> nor <u>ADVANCED</u> variables from the CMake <b>CACHE</b> that match the given regex. If <b>A</b> is
              specified, then it will also show advanced variables.  If <b>H</b> is specified,  it  will  also  display
              help for each variable.

       <b>-N</b>     View mode only.

              Only load the cache.  Do not actually run configure and generate steps.

       <b>--graphviz=&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Generate graphviz of dependencies, see <u>CMakeGraphVizOptions</u> for more.

              Generate  a  graphviz  input file that will contain all the library and executable dependencies in
              the project.  See the documentation for <u>CMakeGraphVizOptions</u> for more details.

       <b>--system-information</b> <b>[file]</b>
              Dump information about this system.

              Dump a wide range of information about the current system.  If run from the top of a  binary  tree
              for a CMake project it will dump additional information such as the cache, log files etc.

       <b>--print-config-dir</b>
              Added in version 3.31.

              Print CMake config directory for user-wide FileAPI queries.

              See <u>CMAKE_CONFIG_DIR</u> for more details.

       <b>--log-level=&lt;level&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.16.

              Set the log <b>&lt;level&gt;</b>.

              The  <u>message()</u>  command will only output messages of the specified log level or higher.  The valid
              log levels are <b>ERROR</b>, <b>WARNING</b>, <b>NOTICE</b>, <b>STATUS</b> (default), <b>VERBOSE</b>, <b>DEBUG</b>, or <b>TRACE</b>.

              To make a log level persist between CMake runs, set <u>CMAKE_MESSAGE_LOG_LEVEL</u> as  a  cache  variable
              instead.   If  both  the  command  line option and the variable are given, the command line option
              takes precedence.

              For backward compatibility reasons, <b>--loglevel</b> is also accepted as a synonym for this option.

              Added in version 3.25: See the <u>cmake_language()</u> command for a way to  <u>query</u>  <u>the</u>  <u>current</u>  <u>message</u>
              <u>logging</u> <u>level</u>.

       <b>--log-context</b>
              Enable the <u>message()</u> command outputting context attached to each message.

              This  option turns on showing context for the current CMake run only.  To make showing the context
              persistent for all subsequent CMake runs,  set  <u>CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT_SHOW</u>  as  a  cache  variable
              instead.  When this command line option is given, <u>CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT_SHOW</u> is ignored.

       <b>--debug-trycompile</b>
              Do  not  delete  the  files  and directories created for <u>try_compile()</u> / <u>try_run()</u> calls.  This is
              useful in debugging failed checks.

              Note that some uses of <u>try_compile()</u> may use the same build tree, which will limit the  usefulness
              of  this  option  if  a  project executes more than one <u>try_compile()</u>.  For example, such uses may
              change results as artifacts from a previous try-compile may cause a different test to either  pass
              or fail incorrectly.  This option is best used only when debugging.

              (With  respect  to  the  preceding,  the  <u>try_run()</u>  command  is effectively a <u>try_compile()</u>.  Any
              combination of the two is subject to the potential issues described.)

              Added in version 3.25: When this option is enabled, every try-compile check prints a  log  message
              reporting the directory in which the check is performed.

       <b>--debug-output</b>
              Put cmake in a debug mode.

              Print extra information during the cmake run like stack traces with <u>message(SEND_ERROR)</u> calls.

       <b>--debug-find</b>
              Added in version 3.17.

              Put cmake find commands in a debug mode.

              Print  extra  find call information during the cmake run to standard error. Output is designed for
              human consumption and not for parsing.  See also the <u>CMAKE_FIND_DEBUG_MODE</u> variable for  debugging
              a more local part of the project.

       <b>--debug-find-pkg=&lt;pkg&gt;[,...]</b>
              Added in version 3.23.

              Put  cmake  find  commands  in a debug mode when running under calls to <u>find_package(&lt;pkg&gt;)</u>, where
              <b>&lt;pkg&gt;</b> is an entry in the given comma-separated list of case-sensitive package names.

              Like <u>--debug-find</u>, but limiting scope to the specified packages.

       <b>--debug-find-var=&lt;var&gt;[,...]</b>
              Added in version 3.23.

              Put cmake find commands in a debug mode when called with <b>&lt;var&gt;</b> as the result variable, where <b>&lt;var&gt;</b>
              is an entry in the given comma-separated list.

              Like <u>--debug-find</u>, but limiting scope to the specified variable names.

       <b>--trace</b>
              Put cmake in trace mode.

              Print a trace of all calls made and from where.

       <b>--trace-expand</b>
              Put cmake in trace mode.

              Like <u>--trace</u>, but with variables expanded.

       <b>--trace-format=&lt;format&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.17.

              Put cmake in trace mode and sets the trace output format.

              <b>&lt;format&gt;</b> can be one of the following values.

                 <b>human</b>  Prints each trace line in a human-readable format. This is the default format.

                 <b>json-v1</b>
                        Prints each line as a separate JSON document. Each document is separated by a newline  (
                        <b>\n</b>  ).  It  is  guaranteed  that  no  newline  characters  will be present inside a JSON
                        document.

                        JSON trace format

                            {
                              "file": "/full/path/to/the/CMake/file.txt",

                            }

                        The members are:

                        <b>file</b>   The full path to the CMake source file where the function was called.

                        <b>line</b>   The line in <b>file</b> where the function call begins.

                        <b>line_end</b>
                               If the function call spans multiple lines, this field will be  set  to  the  line
                               where  the  function  call  ends. If the function calls spans a single line, this
                               field will be unset. This field was added in  minor  version  2  of  the  <b>json-v1</b>
                               format.

                        <b>defer</b>  Optional  member  that  is  present  when  the  function  call  was  deferred  by
                               <u>cmake_language(DEFER)</u>.  If present, its value is a string containing the deferred
                               call <b>&lt;id&gt;</b>.

                        <b>cmd</b>    The name of the function that was called.

                        <b>args</b>   A string list of all function parameters.

                        <b>time</b>   Timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the function call.

                        <b>frame</b>  Stack frame depth of the function that was called,  within  the  context  of  the
                               <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> being processed currently.

                        <b>global_frame</b>
                               Stack  frame  depth  of the function that was called, tracked globally across all
                               <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> files involved in the trace. This field was added in minor version
                               2 of the <b>json-v1</b> format.

                        Additionally, the first JSON document outputted contains the <b>version</b> key for the current
                        major and minor version of the

                        JSON version format

                            {
                              "version": {
                                "major": 1,
                                "minor": 2
                              }
                            }

                        The members are:

                        <b>version</b>
                               Indicates the version of the JSON format. The  version  has  a  major  and  minor
                               components following semantic version conventions.

       <b>--trace-source=&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Put cmake in trace mode, but output only lines of a specified file.

              Multiple options are allowed.

       <b>--trace-redirect=&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Put cmake in trace mode and redirect trace output to a file instead of stderr.

       <b>--warn-uninitialized</b>
              Warn about uninitialized values.

              Print a warning when an uninitialized variable is used.

       <b>--warn-unused-vars</b>
              Does  nothing.   In CMake versions 3.2 and below this enabled warnings about unused variables.  In
              CMake versions 3.3 through 3.18 the option was broken.  In CMake 3.19 and  above  the  option  has
              been removed.

       <b>--no-warn-unused-cli</b>
              Don't warn about command line options.

              Don't find variables that are declared on the command line, but not used.

       <b>--check-system-vars</b>
              Find problems with variable usage in system files.

              Normally,  unused  and  uninitialized  variables  are  searched  for  only in <u>CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR</u> and
              <u>CMAKE_BINARY_DIR</u>.  This flag tells CMake to warn about other files as well.

       <b>--compile-no-warning-as-error</b>
              Added in version 3.24.

              Ignore  target  property  <u>COMPILE_WARNING_AS_ERROR</u>  and  variable  <u>CMAKE_COMPILE_WARNING_AS_ERROR</u>,
              preventing warnings from being treated as errors on compile.

       <b>--profiling-output=&lt;path&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.18.

              Used in conjunction with <u>--profiling-format</u> to output to a given path.

       <b>--profiling-format=&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Enable the output of profiling data of CMake script in the given format.

              This  can  aid  performance analysis of CMake scripts executed. Third party applications should be
              used to process the output into human readable format.

              Currently supported values are: <b>google-trace</b> Outputs in Google Trace Format, which can  be  parsed
              by the <u>about:tracing</u> tab of Google Chrome or using a plugin for a tool like Trace Compass.

       <b>--preset</b> <b>&lt;preset&gt;,</b> <b>--preset=&lt;preset&gt;</b>
              Reads  a  <u>preset</u>  from <b>CMakePresets.json</b> and <b>CMakeUserPresets.json</b> files, which must be located in
              the same directory as the top level <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> file. The preset may specify the generator, the
              build directory, a list of variables, and other arguments to  pass  to  CMake.  At  least  one  of
              <b>CMakePresets.json</b>  or  <b>CMakeUserPresets.json</b>  must  be present.  The <u>CMake</u> <u>GUI</u> also recognizes and
              supports <b>CMakePresets.json</b> and <b>CMakeUserPresets.json</b> files. For full details on these  files,  see
              <u><a href="../man7/cmake-presets.7.html">cmake-presets</a>(7)</u>.

              The  presets are read before all other command line options, although the <u>-S</u> option can be used to
              specify the source directory containing the <b>CMakePresets.json</b> and <b>CMakeUserPresets.json</b> files.  If
              <u>-S</u> is not given, the current directory is assumed to be the top level source  directory  and  must
              contain the presets files. The options specified by the chosen preset (variables, generator, etc.)
              can  all be overridden by manually specifying them on the command line. For example, if the preset
              sets a variable called <b>MYVAR</b> to <b>1</b>, but the user sets it to <b>2</b> with a <b>-D</b> argument, the  value  <b>2</b>  is
              preferred.

       <b>--list-presets[=&lt;type&gt;]</b>
              Lists  the  available  presets  of  the  specified <b>&lt;type&gt;</b>.  Valid values for <b>&lt;type&gt;</b> are <b>configure</b>,
              <b>build</b>, <b>test</b>, <b>package</b>, or <b>all</b>.  If <b>&lt;type&gt;</b> is omitted, <b>configure</b> is assumed.   The  current  working
              directory  must contain CMake preset files unless the <u>-S</u> option is used to specify a different top
              level source directory.

       <b>--debugger</b>
              Enables interactive debugging of the CMake language. CMake exposes a debugging  interface  on  the
              pipe  named  by <u>--debugger-pipe</u> that conforms to the <u>Debug</u> <u>Adapter</u> <u>Protocol</u> specification with the
              following modifications.

              The <b>initialize</b> response includes an  additional  field  named  <b>cmakeVersion</b>  which  specifies  the
              version of CMake being debugged.

              Debugger initialize response

                 {
                   "cmakeVersion": {
                     "major": 3,
                     "minor": 27,
                     "patch": 0,
                     "full": "3.27.0"
                   }
                 }

              The members are:

              <b>major</b>  An integer specifying the major version number.

              <b>minor</b>  An integer specifying the minor version number.

              <b>patch</b>  An integer specifying the patch version number.

              <b>full</b>   A string specifying the full CMake version.

       <b>--debugger-pipe</b> <b>&lt;pipe</b> <b>name&gt;,</b> <b>--debugger-pipe=&lt;pipe</b> <b>name&gt;</b>
              Name of the pipe (on Windows) or domain socket (on Unix) to use for debugger communication.

       <b>--debugger-dap-log</b> <b>&lt;log</b> <b>path&gt;,</b> <b>--debugger-dap-log=&lt;log</b> <b>path&gt;</b>
              Logs all debugger communication to the specified file.

</pre><h4><b>BUILD</b> <b>A</b> <b>PROJECT</b></h4><pre>
       CMake provides a command-line signature to build an already-generated project binary tree:

          cmake --build &lt;dir&gt;             [&lt;options&gt;] [-- &lt;build-tool-options&gt;]
          cmake --build --preset &lt;preset&gt; [&lt;options&gt;] [-- &lt;build-tool-options&gt;]

       This abstracts a native build tool's command-line interface with the following options:

       <b>--build</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
              Project binary directory to be built.  This is required (unless a preset is specified) and must be
              first.

       <b>--preset</b> <b>&lt;preset&gt;,</b> <b>--preset=&lt;preset&gt;</b>
              Use  a  build  preset  to specify build options. The project binary directory is inferred from the
              <b>configurePreset</b> key. The current working directory must contain CMake preset  files.   See  <u>preset</u>
              for more details.

       <b>--list-presets</b>
              Lists the available build presets. The current working directory must contain CMake preset files.

       <b>-j</b> <b>[&lt;jobs&gt;],</b> <b>--parallel</b> <b>[&lt;jobs&gt;]</b>
              Added in version 3.12.

              The  maximum number of concurrent processes to use when building.  If <b>&lt;jobs&gt;</b> is omitted the native
              build tool's default number is used.

              The <u>CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL</u> environment variable, if set, specifies a  default  parallel  level
              when this option is not given.

              Some  native  build  tools  always build in parallel.  The use of <b>&lt;jobs&gt;</b> value of <b>1</b> can be used to
              limit to a single job.

       <b>-t</b> <b>&lt;tgt&gt;...,</b> <b>--target</b> <b>&lt;tgt&gt;...</b>
              Build <b>&lt;tgt&gt;</b> instead of the default target.  Multiple targets may be given, separated by spaces.

       <b>--config</b> <b>&lt;cfg&gt;</b>
              For multi-configuration tools, choose configuration <b>&lt;cfg&gt;</b>.

       <b>--clean-first</b>
              Build target <b>clean</b> first, then build.  (To clean only, use <u>--target</u> <u>clean</u>.)

       <b>--resolve-package-references=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.23.

              Resolve remote package references from external package managers (e.g. NuGet) before  build.  When
              <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>  is set to <b>on</b> (default), packages will be restored before building a target.  When <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
              is set to <b>only</b>, the packages will be restored, but no build will be performed.   When  <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>  is
              set to <b>off</b>, no packages will be restored.

              If the target does not define any package references, this option does nothing.

              This  setting  can  be  specified  in  a build preset (using <b>resolvePackageReferences</b>). The preset
              setting will be ignored, if this command line option is specified.

              If no command line parameter or  preset  option  are  provided,  an  environment-  specific  cache
              variable will be evaluated to decide, if package restoration should be performed.

              When   using   the   Visual   Studio   generator,   package   references  are  defined  using  the
              <u>VS_PACKAGE_REFERENCES</u> property. Package references are restored using NuGet. It can be disabled by
              setting the <b>CMAKE_VS_NUGET_PACKAGE_RESTORE</b> variable to <b>OFF</b>.

       <b>--use-stderr</b>
              Ignored.  Behavior is default in CMake &gt;= 3.0.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Enable verbose output - if supported - including the build commands to be executed.

              This option can be omitted  if  <u>VERBOSE</u>  environment  variable  or  <u>CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE</u>  cached
              variable is set.

       <b>--</b>     Pass remaining options to the native tool.

       Run <u>cmake</u> <u>--build</u> with no options for quick help.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALL</b> <b>A</b> <b>PROJECT</b></h4><pre>
       CMake provides a command-line signature to install an already-generated project binary tree:

          cmake --install &lt;dir&gt; [&lt;options&gt;]

       This may be used after building a project to run installation without using the generated build system or
       the native build tool.  The options are:

       <b>--install</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
              Project binary directory to install. This is required and must be first.

       <b>--config</b> <b>&lt;cfg&gt;</b>
              For multi-configuration generators, choose configuration <b>&lt;cfg&gt;</b>.

       <b>--component</b> <b>&lt;comp&gt;</b>
              Component-based install. Only install component <b>&lt;comp&gt;</b>.

       <b>--default-directory-permissions</b> <b>&lt;permissions&gt;</b>
              Default directory install permissions. Permissions in format <b>&lt;u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx&gt;</b>.

       <b>--prefix</b> <b>&lt;prefix&gt;</b>
              Override the installation prefix, <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u>.

       <b>--strip</b>
              Strip before installing.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Enable verbose output.

              This option can be omitted if <u>VERBOSE</u> environment variable is set.

       <b>-j</b> <b>&lt;jobs&gt;,</b> <b>--parallel</b> <b>&lt;jobs&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.31.

              Install in parallel using the given number of jobs. Only available if <u>INSTALL_PARALLEL</u> is enabled.
              The <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_PARALLEL_LEVEL</u> environment variable specifies a default parallel level when this
              option is not provided.

       Run <u>cmake</u> <u>--install</u> with no options for quick help.

</pre><h4><b>OPEN</b> <b>A</b> <b>PROJECT</b></h4><pre>
          cmake --open &lt;dir&gt;

       Open the generated project in the associated application.  This is only supported by some generators.

</pre><h4><b>RUN</b> <b>A</b> <b>SCRIPT</b></h4><pre>
          cmake [-D &lt;var&gt;=&lt;value&gt;]... -P &lt;cmake-script-file&gt; [-- &lt;unparsed-options&gt;...]

       <b>-D</b> <b>&lt;var&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Define a variable for script mode.

       <b>-P</b> <b>&lt;cmake-script-file&gt;</b>
              Process  the given cmake file as a script written in the CMake language.  No configure or generate
              step is performed and the cache is not modified.  If variables are defined using <b>-D</b>, this must  be
              done before the <b>-P</b> argument.

       Any  options  after  <b>--</b>  are not parsed by CMake, but they are still included in the set of <u>CMAKE_ARGV&lt;n&gt;</u>
       variables passed to the script (including the <b>--</b> itself).

</pre><h4><b>RUN</b> <b>A</b> <b>COMMAND-LINE</b> <b>TOOL</b></h4><pre>
       CMake provides builtin command-line tools through the signature

          cmake -E &lt;command&gt; [&lt;options&gt;]

       <b>-E</b> <b>[help]</b>
              Run <b>cmake</b> <b>-E</b> or <b>cmake</b> <b>-E</b> <b>help</b> for a summary of commands.

       Available commands are:

       <b>capabilities</b>
              Added in version 3.7.

              <b>version</b>
                     A JSON object with version information. Keys are:

                     <b>string</b> The full version string as displayed by cmake <u>--version</u>.

                     <b>major</b>  The major version number in integer form.

                     <b>patch</b>  The patch level in integer form.

                     <b>suffix</b> The cmake version suffix string.

                     <b>isDirty</b>
                            A bool that is set if the cmake build is from a dirty tree.

              <b>generators</b>
                     A list available generators. Each generator is a JSON object with the following keys:

                     <b>name</b>   A string containing the name of the generator.

                     <b>toolsetSupport</b>
                            <b>true</b> if the generator supports toolsets and <b>false</b> otherwise.

                     <b>platformSupport</b>
                            <b>true</b> if the generator supports platforms and <b>false</b> otherwise.

                     <b>supportedPlatforms</b>
                            Added in version 3.21.

                            Optional  member  that  may  be  present  when  the  generator   supports   platform
                            specification  via  <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM</u>  (<u>-A</u>  <u>...</u>).   The  value  is  a list of
                            platforms known to be supported.

                     <b>extraGenerators</b>
                            A list of strings with all the <u>Extra</u> <u>Generators</u> compatible with the generator.

              <b>fileApi</b>
                     Optional member that is present when the <u><a href="../man7/cmake-file-api.7.html">cmake-file-api</a>(7)</u> is available.  The  value  is  a
                     JSON object with one member:

                     <b>requests</b>
                            A JSON array containing zero or more supported file-api requests.  Each request is a
                            JSON object with members:

                            <b>kind</b>   Specifies one of the supported <u>Object</u> <u>Kinds</u>.

                            <b>version</b>
                                   A JSON array whose elements are each a JSON object containing <b>major</b> and <b>minor</b>
                                   members specifying non-negative integer version components.

              <b>serverMode</b>
                     <b>true</b> if cmake supports server-mode and <b>false</b> otherwise.  Always false since CMake 3.20.

              <b>tls</b>    Added in version 3.25.

                     <b>true</b> if TLS support is enabled and <b>false</b> otherwise.

              <b>debugger</b>
                     Added in version 3.27.

                     <b>true</b> if the <u>--debugger</u> mode is supported and <b>false</b> otherwise.

       <b>cat</b> <b>[--]</b> <b>&lt;files&gt;...</b>
              Added in version 3.18.

              Concatenate files and print on the standard output.

              <b>--</b>     Added in version 3.24.

                     Added  support  for  the double dash argument <b>--</b>. This basic implementation of <b>cat</b> does not
                     support any options, so using a option starting with <b>-</b> will result in an error. Use  <b>--</b>  to
                     indicate the end of options, in case a file starts with <b>-</b>.

              Added in version 3.29: <b>cat</b> can now print the standard input by passing the <b>-</b> argument.

       <b>chdir</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b> <b>&lt;cmd&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;arg&gt;...]</b>
              Change the current working directory and run a command.

       <b>compare_files</b> <b>[--ignore-eol]</b> <b>&lt;file1&gt;</b> <b>&lt;file2&gt;</b>
              Check  if  <b>&lt;file1&gt;</b> is same as <b>&lt;file2&gt;</b>. If files are the same, then returns <b>0</b>, if not it returns <b>1</b>.
              In case of invalid arguments, it returns 2.

              <b>--ignore-eol</b>
                     Added in version 3.14.

                     The option implies line-wise comparison and ignores LF/CRLF differences.

       <b>copy</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;...</b> <b>&lt;destination&gt;,</b> <b>copy</b> <b>-t</b> <b>&lt;destination&gt;</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;...</b>
              Copy files to <b>&lt;destination&gt;</b> (either file or directory).  If multiple files are specified, or if <b>-t</b>
              is specified, the <b>&lt;destination&gt;</b> must be directory and it must exist. If <b>-t</b> is not  specified,  the
              last  argument  is assumed to be the <b>&lt;destination&gt;</b>.  Wildcards are not supported. <b>copy</b> does follow
              symlinks. That means it does not copy symlinks, but the files or directories it point to.

              Added in version 3.5: Support for multiple input files.

              Added in version 3.26: Support for <b>-t</b> argument.

       <b>copy_directory</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;...</b> <b>&lt;destination&gt;</b>
              Copy content of <b>&lt;dir&gt;...</b> directories to <b>&lt;destination&gt;</b> directory.  If <b>&lt;destination&gt;</b> directory  does
              not exist it will be created.  <b>copy_directory</b> does follow symlinks.

              Added in version 3.5: Support for multiple input directories.

              Added in version 3.15: The command now fails when the source directory does not exist.  Previously
              it succeeded by creating an empty destination directory.

       <b>copy_directory_if_different</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;...</b> <b>&lt;destination&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.26.

              Copy  changed  content  of  <b>&lt;dir&gt;...</b>  directories  to  <b>&lt;destination&gt;</b>  directory.  If <b>&lt;destination&gt;</b>
              directory does not exist it will be created.

              <b>copy_directory_if_different</b> does follow symlinks.  The command fails  when  the  source  directory
              does not exist.

       <b>copy_if_different</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;...</b> <b>&lt;destination&gt;</b>
              Copy  files  to  <b>&lt;destination&gt;</b> (either file or directory) if they have changed.  If multiple files
              are specified, the <b>&lt;destination&gt;</b> must be directory and  it  must  exist.   <b>copy_if_different</b>  does
              follow symlinks.

              Added in version 3.5: Support for multiple input files.

       <b>create_symlink</b> <b>&lt;old&gt;</b> <b>&lt;new&gt;</b>
              Create a symbolic link <b>&lt;new&gt;</b> naming <b>&lt;old&gt;</b>.

              Added in version 3.13: Support for creating symlinks on Windows.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Path to where <b>&lt;new&gt;</b> symbolic link will be created has to exist beforehand.

       <b>create_hardlink</b> <b>&lt;old&gt;</b> <b>&lt;new&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.19.

              Create a hard link <b>&lt;new&gt;</b> naming <b>&lt;old&gt;</b>.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Path  to  where  <b>&lt;new&gt;</b>  hard  link will be created has to exist beforehand.  <b>&lt;old&gt;</b> has to exist
                 beforehand.

       <b>echo</b> <b>[&lt;string&gt;...]</b>
              Displays arguments as text.

       <b>echo_append</b> <b>[&lt;string&gt;...]</b>
              Displays arguments as text but no new line.

       <b>env</b> <b>[&lt;options&gt;]</b> <b>[--]</b> <b>&lt;command&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;arg&gt;...]</b>
              Added in version 3.1.

              Run command in a modified environment. Options are:

              <b>NAME=VALUE</b>
                     Replaces the current value of <b>NAME</b> with <b>VALUE</b>.

              <b>--unset=NAME</b>
                     Unsets the current value of <b>NAME</b>.

              <b>--modify</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT_MODIFICATION</b>
                     Added in version 3.25.

                     Apply a single <u>ENVIRONMENT_MODIFICATION</u> operation to the modified environment.

                     The <b>NAME=VALUE</b> and <b>--unset=NAME</b> options  are  equivalent  to  <b>--modify</b>  <b>NAME=set:VALUE</b>  and
                     <b>--modify</b>  <b>NAME=unset:</b>,  respectively.   Note  that  <b>--modify</b> <b>NAME=reset:</b> resets <b>NAME</b> to the
                     value it had when <b>cmake</b> launched (or unsets it), not to the most recent <b>NAME=VALUE</b> option.

              <b>--</b>     Added in version 3.24.

                     Added  support  for  the  double  dash  argument  <b>--</b>.   Use   <b>--</b>   to   stop   interpreting
                     options/environment  variables and treat the next argument as the command, even if it start
                     with <b>-</b> or contains a <b>=</b>.

       <b>environment</b>
              Display the current environment variables.

       <b>false</b>  Added in version 3.16.

              Do nothing, with an exit code of 1.

       <b>make_directory</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;...</b>
              Create <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b> directories.  If necessary, create parent directories too.  If  a  directory  already
              exists it will be silently ignored.

              Added in version 3.5: Support for multiple input directories.

       <b>md5sum</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;...</b>
              Create MD5 checksum of files in <b>md5sum</b> compatible format:

       <b>remove</b> <b>[-f]</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;...</b>
              Deprecated since version 3.17.

              Remove the file(s). The planned behavior was that if any of the listed files already do not exist,
              the  command  returns  a  non-zero  exit code, but no message is logged. The <b>-f</b> option changes the
              behavior to return a zero exit code (i.e. success) in such situations instead.   <b>remove</b>  does  not
              follow symlinks. That means it remove only symlinks and not files it point to.

              The  implementation was buggy and always returned 0. It cannot be fixed without breaking backwards
              compatibility. Use <b>rm</b> instead.

       <b>remove_directory</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;...</b>
              Deprecated since version 3.17.

              Remove <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b> directories and their contents. If a directory does not exist  it  will  be  silently
              ignored.  Use <b>rm</b> instead.

              Added in version 3.15: Support for multiple directories.

              Added in version 3.16: If <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b> is a symlink to a directory, just the symlink will be removed.

       <b>rename</b> <b>&lt;oldname&gt;</b> <b>&lt;newname&gt;</b>
              Rename  a  file or directory (on one volume). If file with the <b>&lt;newname&gt;</b> name already exists, then
              it will be silently replaced.

       <b>rm</b> <b>[-rRf]</b> <b>[--]</b> <b>&lt;file|dir&gt;...</b>
              Added in version 3.17.

              Remove the files <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> or directories <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>.  Use <b>-r</b>  or  <b>-R</b>  to  remove  directories  and  their
              contents  recursively.  If any of the listed files/directories do not exist, the command returns a
              non-zero exit code, but no message is logged. The <b>-f</b> option changes the behavior to return a  zero
              exit code (i.e. success) in such situations instead. Use <b>--</b> to stop interpreting options and treat
              all remaining arguments as paths, even if they start with <b>-</b>.

       <b>sleep</b> <b>&lt;number&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.0.

              Sleep for <b>&lt;number&gt;</b> seconds. <b>&lt;number&gt;</b> may be a floating point number.  A practical minimum is about
              0.1  seconds  due to overhead in starting/stopping CMake executable. This can be useful in a CMake
              script to insert a delay:

                 # Sleep for about 0.5 seconds
                 execute_process(COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E sleep 0.5)

       <b>tar</b> <b>[cxt][vf][zjJ]</b> <b>file.tar</b> <b>[&lt;options&gt;]</b> <b>[--]</b> <b>[&lt;pathname&gt;...]</b>
              Create or extract a tar or zip archive.  Options are:

              <b>c</b>      Create a new archive containing the specified files.  If used, the  <b>&lt;pathname&gt;...</b>  argument
                     is mandatory.

              <b>x</b>      Extract to disk from the archive.

                     Added  in  version  3.15: The <b>&lt;pathname&gt;...</b> argument could be used to extract only selected
                     files or directories.  When extracting selected files  or  directories,  you  must  provide
                     their exact names including the path, as printed by list (<b>-t</b>).

              <b>t</b>      List archive contents.

                     Added in version 3.15: The <b>&lt;pathname&gt;...</b> argument could be used to list only selected files
                     or directories.

              <b>v</b>      Produce verbose output.

              <b>z</b>      Compress the resulting archive with gzip.

              <b>j</b>      Compress the resulting archive with bzip2.

              <b>J</b>      Added in version 3.1.

                     Compress the resulting archive with XZ.

              <b>--zstd</b> Added in version 3.15.

                     Compress the resulting archive with Zstandard.

              <b>--files-from=&lt;file&gt;</b>
                     Added in version 3.1.

                     Read file names from the given file, one per line.  Blank lines are ignored.  Lines may not
                     start in <b>-</b> except for <b>--add-file=&lt;name&gt;</b> to add files whose names start in <b>-</b>.

              <b>--format=&lt;format&gt;</b>
                     Added in version 3.3.

                     Specify the format of the archive to be created.  Supported formats are: <b>7zip</b>, <b>gnutar</b>, <b>pax</b>,
                     <b>paxr</b> (restricted pax, default), and <b>zip</b>.

              <b>--mtime=&lt;date&gt;</b>
                     Added in version 3.1.

                     Specify modification time recorded in tarball entries.

              <b>--touch</b>
                     Added in version 3.24.

                     Use current local timestamp instead of extracting file timestamps from the archive.

              <b>--</b>     Added in version 3.1.

                     Stop  interpreting  options  and  treat all remaining arguments as file names, even if they
                     start with <b>-</b>.

              Added in version 3.1: LZMA (7zip) support.

              Added in version 3.15: The command now continues adding files to an archive even if  some  of  the
              files  are  not readable.  This behavior is more consistent with the classic <b>tar</b> tool. The command
              now also parses all flags, and if an invalid flag was provided, a warning is issued.

       <b>time</b> <b>&lt;command&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;args&gt;...]</b>
              Run <b>&lt;command&gt;</b> and display elapsed time (including overhead of CMake frontend).

              Added in version 3.5: The command now properly passes arguments with spaces or special  characters
              through  to  the  child  process. This may break scripts that worked around the bug with their own
              extra quoting or escaping.

       <b>touch</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;...</b>
              Creates <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> if file do not  exist.   If  <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>  exists,  it  is  changing  <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>  access  and
              modification times.

       <b>touch_nocreate</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;...</b>
              Touch  a  file  if  it  exists but do not create it.  If a file does not exist it will be silently
              ignored.

       <b>true</b>   Added in version 3.16.

              Do nothing, with an exit code of 0.

   <b>Windows-specific</b> <b>Command-Line</b> <b>Tools</b>
       The following <b>cmake</b> <b>-E</b> commands are available only on Windows:

       <b>delete_regv</b> <b>&lt;key&gt;</b>
              Delete Windows registry value.

       <b>env_vs8_wince</b> <b>&lt;sdkname&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.2.

              Displays a batch file which sets the environment for the provided  Windows  CE  SDK  installed  in
              VS2005.

       <b>env_vs9_wince</b> <b>&lt;sdkname&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.2.

              Displays  a  batch  file  which  sets the environment for the provided Windows CE SDK installed in
              VS2008.

       <b>write_regv</b> <b>&lt;key&gt;</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Write Windows registry value.

</pre><h4><b>RUN</b> <b>THE</b> <b>FIND-PACKAGE</b> <b>TOOL</b></h4><pre>
       CMake provides a pkg-config like helper for Makefile-based projects:

          cmake --find-package [&lt;options&gt;]

       It searches a package using <u>find_package()</u> and prints the resulting flags to stdout.  This  can  be  used
       instead  of  pkg-config to find installed libraries in plain Makefile-based projects or in autoconf-based
       projects (via <b>share/aclocal/cmake.m4</b>).

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This mode is not well-supported due to some technical limitations.  It is kept for  compatibility  but
          should not be used in new projects.

</pre><h4><b>RUN</b> <b>A</b> <b>WORKFLOW</b> <b>PRESET</b></h4><pre>
       Added in version 3.25.

       <u>CMake</u> <u>Presets</u> provides a way to execute multiple build steps in order:

          cmake --workflow &lt;options&gt;

       The options are:

       <b>--workflow</b>
              Select a <u>Workflow</u> <u>Preset</u> using one of the following options.

       <b>--preset</b> <b>&lt;preset&gt;,</b> <b>--preset=&lt;preset&gt;</b>
              Use  a  workflow  preset  to specify a workflow. The project binary directory is inferred from the
              initial configure preset. The current working directory must  contain  CMake  preset  files.   See
              <u>preset</u> for more details.

              Changed  in  version  3.31:  When  following immediately after the <b>--workflow</b> option, the <b>--preset</b>
              argument can be omitted and just the <b>&lt;preset&gt;</b> name can be given.  This means the following  syntax
              is valid:

                 $ cmake --workflow my-preset

       <b>--list-presets</b>
              Lists  the  available  workflow  presets.  The current working directory must contain CMake preset
              files.

       <b>--fresh</b>
              Perform a fresh configuration of the build tree, which has the same effect as <u>cmake</u> <u>--fresh</u>.

</pre><h4><b>VIEW</b> <b>HELP</b></h4><pre>
       To print selected pages from the CMake documentation, use

          cmake --help[-&lt;topic&gt;]

       with one of the following options:

       <b>-version</b> <b>[&lt;file&gt;],</b> <b>--version</b> <b>[&lt;file&gt;],</b> <b>/V</b> <b>[&lt;file&gt;]</b>
              Show program name/version banner and exit.  The output is printed to a named <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> if given.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>-H,</b> <b>--help,</b> <b>-help,</b> <b>-usage,</b> <b>/?</b>
              Print usage information and exit.

              Usage describes the basic command line interface and its options.

       <b>--help</b> <b>&lt;keyword&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;file&gt;]</b>
              Print help for one CMake keyword.

              <b>&lt;keyword&gt;</b> can be a property, variable, command, policy, generator or module.

              The relevant manual entry for <b>&lt;keyword&gt;</b> is printed in a human-readable text format.  The output is
              printed to a named <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> if given.

              Changed in version 3.28: Prior to CMake 3.28, this option supported command names only.

       <b>--help-full</b> <b>[&lt;file&gt;]</b>
              Print all help manuals and exit.

              All manuals are printed in a human-readable text format.  The output is printed to a named  <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
