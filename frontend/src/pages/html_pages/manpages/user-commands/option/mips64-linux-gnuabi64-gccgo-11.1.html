</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gccgo - A GCC-based compiler for the Go language

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       gccgo [<b>-c</b>|<b>-S</b>]
             [<b>-g</b>] [<b>-pg</b>] [<b>-O</b><u>level</u>]
             [<b>-I</b><u>dir</u>...] [<b>-L</b><u>dir</u>...]
             [<b>-o</b> <u>outfile</u>] <u>infile</u>...

       Only the most useful options are listed here; see below for the remainder.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>gccgo</b> command is a frontend to <b>gcc</b> and supports many of the same options.    This manual only
       documents the options specific to <b>gccgo</b>.

       The <b>gccgo</b> command may be used to compile Go source code into an object file, link a collection of object
       files together, or do both in sequence.

       Go source code is compiled as packages.  A package consists of one or more Go source files.  All the
       files in a single package must be compiled together, by passing all the files as arguments to <b>gccgo</b>.  A
       single invocation of <b>gccgo</b> may only compile a single package.

       One Go package may "import" a different Go package.  The imported package must have already been
       compiled; <b>gccgo</b> will read the import data directly from the compiled package.  When this package is later
       linked, the compiled form of the package must be included in the link command.

       Go programs must generally be compiled with debugging information, and <b>-g1</b> is the default as described
       below.  Stripping a Go program will generally cause it to misbehave or fail.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-I</b><u>dir</u>
           Specify a directory to use when searching for an import package at compile time.

       <b>-L</b><u>dir</u>
           When linking, specify a library search directory, as with <b>gcc</b>.

       <b>-fgo-pkgpath=</b><u>string</u>
           Set  the  package  path  to  use.  This sets the value returned by the PkgPath method of reflect.Type
           objects.  It is also used for the names of globally visible symbols.  The  argument  to  this  option
           should  normally  be the string that will be used to import this package after it has been installed;
           in other words, a pathname within the directories specified by the <b>-I</b> option.

       <b>-fgo-prefix=</b><u>string</u>
           An alternative to <b>-fgo-pkgpath</b>.  The argument will be combined with the package name from the  source
           file to produce the package path.  If <b>-fgo-pkgpath</b> is used, <b>-fgo-prefix</b> will be ignored.

           Go  permits  a  single  program  to include more than one package with the same name in the "package"
           clause in the source file, though obviously  the  two  packages  must  be  imported  using  different
           pathnames.   In  order  for  this  to  work  with  <b>gccgo</b>,  either <b>-fgo-pkgpath</b> or <b>-fgo-prefix</b> must be
           specified when compiling a package.

           Using either <b>-fgo-pkgpath</b> or <b>-fgo-prefix</b> disables the special treatment of  the  "main"  package  and
           permits that package to be imported like any other.

       <b>-fgo-relative-import-path=</b><u>dir</u>
           A  relative  import  is an import that starts with <u>./</u> or <u>../</u>.  If this option is used, <b>gccgo</b> will use
           <u>dir</u> as a prefix for the relative import when searching for it.

       <b>-frequire-return-statement</b>
       <b>-fno-require-return-statement</b>
           By default <b>gccgo</b> will warn about functions which have one or  more  return  parameters  but  lack  an
           explicit "return" statement.  This warning may be disabled using <b>-fno-require-return-statement</b>.

       <b>-fgo-check-divide-zero</b>
           Add  explicit checks for division by zero.  In Go a division (or modulos) by zero causes a panic.  On
           Unix systems this is detected in the runtime by catching the "SIGFPE" signal.  Some processors,  such
           as  PowerPC,  do  not  generate a SIGFPE on division by zero.  Some runtimes do not generate a signal
           that can be caught.  On those systems, this option may be used.  Or the checks  may  be  removed  via
           <b>-fno-go-check-divide-zero</b>.   This  option is currently on by default, but in the future may be off by
           default on systems that do not require it.

       <b>-fgo-check-divide-overflow</b>
           Add explicit checks for division overflow.  For example,  division  overflow  occurs  when  computing
           "INT_MIN  /  -1".  In Go this should be wrapped, to produce "INT_MIN".  Some processors, such as x86,
           generate a trap on division overflow.  On those systems, this option may be used.  Or the checks  may
           be  removed  via  <b>-fno-go-check-divide-overflow</b>.   This option is currently on by default, but in the
           future may be off by default on systems that do not require it.

       <b>-fno-go-optimize-allocs</b>
           Disable escape analysis, which tries to allocate objects on the stack rather than the heap.

       <b>-fgo-debug-escape</b><u>n</u>
           Output escape analysis debugging information.  Larger values of <u>n</u> generate more information.

       <b>-fgo-debug-escape-hash=</b><u>n</u>
           A hash value to debug escape analysis.  <u>n</u> is a binary string.  This  runs  escape  analysis  only  on
           functions  whose  names  hash  to  values  that match the given suffix <u>n</u>.  This can be used to binary
           search across functions to uncover escape analysis bugs.

       <b>-fgo-debug-optimization</b>
           Output optimization diagnostics.

       <b>-fgo-c-header=</b><u>file</u>
           Write top-level named Go struct definitions to <u>file</u> as C code.   This  is  used  when  compiling  the
           runtime package.

       <b>-fgo-compiling-runtime</b>
           Apply  special  rules  for  compiling  the runtime package.  Implicit memory allocation is forbidden.
           Some additional compiler directives are supported.

       <b>-fgo-embedcfg=</b><u>file</u>
           Identify a JSON file used to map patterns used with special "//go:embed" comments to the files  named
           by the patterns.  The JSON file should have two components: "Patterns" maps each pattern to a list of
           file  names, and "Files" maps each file name to a full path to the file.  This option is intended for
           use by the <b>go</b> command to implement "//go:embed".

       <b>-g</b>  This is the standard <b>gcc</b> option.  It is mentioned here because by default <b>gccgo</b>  turns  on  debugging
           information  generation  with the equivalent of the standard option <b>-g1</b>.  This is because Go programs
           require debugging information to be available in order to get backtrace information.  An explicit <b>-g0</b>
           may be used to disable the generation of  debugging  information,  in  which  case  certain  standard
           library functions, such as "runtime.Callers", will not operate correctly.
