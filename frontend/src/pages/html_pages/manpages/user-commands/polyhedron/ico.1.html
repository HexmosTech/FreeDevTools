       ico - animate an icosahedron or other polyhedron

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ico</b>  [-display display] [-geometry geometry] [-r] [-d pattern] [-i] [-dbl] [-faces] [-noedges] [-sleep n]
       [-obj object] [-colors color-list]

       <b>ico</b> -version

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Ico</u> displays a wire-frame rotating polyhedron, with hidden lines removed, or a solid-fill polyhedron with
       hidden faces removed.  There are a number of different polyhedra available; adding a  new  polyhedron  to
       the program is quite simple.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-r</b>     Display on the root window instead of creating a new window.

       <b>-d</b> <b>pattern</b>
              Specify a bit pattern for drawing dashed lines for wire frames.

       <b>-i</b>     Use inverted colors for wire frames.

       <b>-dbl</b>   Use  double  buffering  on  the display.  This works for either wire frame or solid fill drawings.
              For solid fill drawings, using this switch results in substantially smoother movement.  Note  that
              this  requires  twice  as  many  bit  planes  as  without double buffering.  Since some colors are
              typically allocated by other programs, most eight-bit-plane displays will probably be  limited  to
              eight colors when using double buffering.

       <b>-faces</b> Draw filled faces instead of wire frames.

       <b>-noedges</b>
              Don't draw the wire frames.  Typically used only when -faces is used.

       <b>-sleep</b> <u>n</u>
              Sleep n seconds between each move of the object.

       <b>-obj</b> <u>object</u>
              Specify what object to draw.  If no object is specified, an icosahedron is drawn.

       <b>-objhelp</b>
              Print out a list of the available objects, along with information about each object.

       <b>-colors</b> <u>color</u> <u>color</u> <u>...</u>
              Specify  what  colors  should be used to draw the filled faces of the object.  If less colors than
              faces are given, the colors are reused.

       <b>-version</b>
              Print program version information and exit.

</pre><h4><b>PROGRAM</b> <b>TERMINATION</b></h4><pre>
       Pressing "q" will close a window. If compiled with threads support, the program will stop only  when  all
       threads  terminate.  You  can also close an animation window using the ICCCM <u>delete</u> message (depending on
       your window manager, you will have a decoration button or menu to send such message).

</pre><h4><b>ADDING</b> <b>POLYHEDRA</b></h4><pre>
       If you have the source to ico, it is very easy to add more polyhedra.  Each polyhedron is defined  in  an
       include  file by the name of objXXX.h, where XXX is something related to the name of the polyhedron.  The
       format of the include file is defined in the file polyinfo.h.  Look at the file objcube.h to see what the
       exact format of an objXXX.h file should be, then create your objXXX.h file in that format.

       After making the new objXXX.h file (or copying in a new one from elsewhere), simply do a  'make  depend'.
       This  will recreate the file allobjs.h, which lists all of the objXXX.h files.  Doing a 'make' after this
       will rebuild ico with the new object information.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Pyramids and tetrahedrons with filled faces do not display correctly.

       A separate color cell is allocated for each name in the -colors list, even when  the  same  name  may  be
       specified twice.  Color allocation fails in TrueColor displays and option <u>-faces</u> does not work well.
