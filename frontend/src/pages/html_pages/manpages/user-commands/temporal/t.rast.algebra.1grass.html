</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>t.rast.algebra</u> performs temporal and spatial map algebra operations on space time raster datasets (STRDS)
       using the temporal raster algebra.

       The module expects an <b>expression</b> as input parameter in the following form:

       <b>"result</b> <b>=</b> <b>expression"</b>

       The statement structure is similar to that of r.mapcalc.  In this statement, <b>result</b> represents  the  name
       of the space time raster dataset (STRDS) that will contain the result of the calculation that is given as
       <b>expression</b>  on  the  right  side  of  the  equality  sign.   These expressions can be any valid or nested
       combination of temporal operations and spatial overlay or buffer  functions  that  are  provided  by  the
       temporal algebra.

       The  temporal  raster  algebra  works  only with space time raster datasets (STRDS). The algebra provides
       methods for map selection based on their temporal relations. It is  also  possible  to  temporally  shift
       maps,  to  create  temporal  buffer  and  to  snap  time  instances  to create a valid temporal topology.
       Furthermore, expressions can be nested and evaluated in conditional  statements  (if,  else  statements).
       Within  if-statements,  the  algebra  provides temporal variables like start time, end time, day of year,
       time differences or number of maps per time interval to build up conditions.
       In addition the algebra provides a subset of the spatial operations from r.mapcalc. All these  operations
       can be assigned to STRDS or to the map lists resulting of operations between STRDS.

       By  default,  only  temporal topological relations among space time datasets (STDS) are evaluated. The <b>-s</b>
       flag can be used to additionally activate the evaluation of the spatial topology  based  on  the  spatial
       extent of maps.

       The expression option must be passed as <b>quoted</b> expression, for example:
       t.rast.algebra expression="C = A + B" basename=result
       Where  <b>C</b>  is  the  new  space time raster dataset that will contain maps with the basename "result" and a
       numerical suffix separated by an underscore that  represent  the  sum  of  maps  from  the  STRDS  <b>A</b>  and
       temporally equal maps (i.e., maps with equal temporal topology relation) from the STRDS <b>B</b>.

       The map <b>basename</b> for the result STRDS must always be specified.

</pre><h4><b>TEMPORAL</b> <b>RASTER</b> <b>ALGEBRA</b></h4><pre>
       The  temporal algebra provides a wide range of temporal operators and functions that will be presented in
       the following section.

   <b>TEMPORAL</b> <b>RELATIONS</b>
       Several temporal topology relations are supported between maps registered in space time datasets:
       equals            A ------
                         B ------
       during            A  ----
                         B ------
       contains          A ------
                         B  ----
       starts            A ----
                         B ------
       started           A ------
                         B ----
       finishes          A   ----
                         B ------
       finished          A ------
                         B   ----
       precedes          A ----
                         B     ----
       follows           A     ----
                         B ----
       overlapped        A   ------
                         B ------
       overlaps          A ------
                         B   ------
       over              both overlaps and overlapped
       The relations must be read as: A is related to B, like - A equals B - A is during B - A contains B.

       Topological relations must be specified with curly brackets {}.

   <b>TEMPORAL</b> <b>OPERATORS</b>
       The temporal algebra defines temporal operators that can be combined  with  other  operators  to  perform
       spatio-temporal  operations.   The  temporal  operators  process  the time instances and intervals of two
       temporally related maps and calculate the resulting temporal extent in five possible different ways.
       LEFT REFERENCE     l       Use the time stamp of the left space time dataset
       INTERSECTION       i       Intersection
       DISJOINT UNION     d       Disjoint union
       UNION              u       Union
       RIGHT REFERENCE    r       Use the time stamp of the right space time dataset

   <b>TEMPORAL</b> <b>SELECTION</b>
       The temporal selection simply selects parts of a space time dataset  without  processing  any  raster  or
       vector  data.  The  algebra provides a selection operator <b>:</b> that by default selects parts of a space time
       dataset that are temporally equal to parts of a second space time dataset. The following expression
       C = A : B
       means: select all parts of space time dataset A that are equal to B and store them in space time  dataset
       C. These parts are time stamped maps.

       In  addition,  the  inverse selection operator <b>!:</b> is defined as the complement of the selection operator,
       hence the following expression
       C = A !: B
       means: select all parts of space time time dataset A that are not equal to B and store them in space time
       dataset C.

       To select parts of a STRDS using different topological relations regarding to other STRDS,  the  temporal
       topology  selection  operator can be used. This operator consists of the temporal selection operator, the
       topological relations that must be separated by the logical  OR  operator  <b>|</b>  and,  the  temporal  extent
       operator.  All three parts are separated by comma and surrounded by curly brackets as follows: {"temporal
       selection operator", "topological relations", "temporal operator"}.

       <b>Examples:</b>
       C = A {:,equals} B
       C = A {!:,equals} B
       We can now define arbitrary topological relations using the OR operator "|" to connect them:
       C = A {:,equals|during|overlaps} B
       Select all parts of A that are equal to B, during B or overlaps B.
       In addition, we can define the temporal extent of the resulting STRDS by adding the temporal operator.
       C = A {:,during,r} B
       Select all parts of A that are during B and use the temporal extents from B for C.
       The selection operator is implicitly contained in the temporal topology selection operator, so  that  the
       following statements are exactly the same:
       C = A : B
       C = A {:} B
       C = A {:,equal} B
       C = A {:,equal,l} B
       Same for the complementary selection:
       C = A !: B
       C = A {!:} B
       C = A {!:,equal} B
       C = A {!:,equal,l} B

   <b>CONDITIONAL</b> <b>STATEMENTS</b>
       Selection  operations  can  be evaluated within conditional statements as showed below. Note that A and B
       can be either space time datasets or expressions. The temporal relationship between  the  conditions  and
       the  conclusions  can  be defined at the beginning of the if statement (third and fourth examples below).
       The relationship between then and else conclusion must be always equal.
       if statement                        decision option                        temporal relations
         if(if, then, else)
         if(conditions, A)                   A if conditions are True;              temporal topological relation between if and then is equal.
         if(conditions, A, B)                A if conditions are True, B otherwise; temporal topological relation between if, then and else is equal.
         if(topologies, conditions, A)       A if conditions are True;              temporal topological relation between if and then is explicitly specified by topologies.
         if(topologies, conditions, A, B)    A if conditions are True, B otherwise; temporal topological relation between if, then and else is explicitly specified by topologies.
       The conditions are comparison expressions that are used to evaluate space time datasets. Specific  values
       of temporal variables are compared by logical operators and evaluated for each map of the STRDS.
       <b>Important:</b> The conditions are evaluated from left to right.

   <b>Temporal</b> <b>functions</b>
       The following temporal functions are evaluated only for the STDS that must be given in parenthesis.
       td(A)                    Returns a list of time intervals of STDS A
       start_time(A)            Start time as HH::MM:SS
       start_date(A)            Start date as yyyy-mm-DD
       start_datetime(A)        Start datetime as yyyy-mm-DD HH:MM:SS
       end_time(A)              End time as HH:MM:SS
       end_date(A)              End date as yyyy-mm-DD

       start_doy(A)             Day of year (doy) from the start time [1 - 366]
       start_dow(A)             Day of week (dow) from the start time [1 - 7], the start of the week is Monday == 1
       start_year(A)            The year of the start time [0 - 9999]
       start_month(A)           The month of the start time [1 - 12]
       start_week(A)            Week of year of the start time [1 - 54]
       start_day(A)             Day of month from the start time [1 - 31]
       start_hour(A)            The hour of the start time [0 - 23]
       start_minute(A)          The minute of the start time [0 - 59]
       start_second(A)          The second of the start time [0 - 59]
       end_doy(A)               Day of year (doy) from the end time [1 - 366]
       end_dow(A)               Day of week (dow) from the end time [1 - 7], the start of the week is Monday == 1
       end_year(A)              The year of the end time [0 - 9999]
       end_month(A)             The month of the end time [1 - 12]
       end_week(A)              Week of year of the end time [1 - 54]
       end_day(A)               Day of month from the start time [1 - 31]
       end_hour(A)              The hour of the end time [0 - 23]
       end_minute(A)            The minute of the end time [0 - 59]
       end_second(A)            The second of the end time [0 - 59]
       In  order  to use the numbers returned by the functions in the last block above, an offset value needs to
       be added. For example, start_doy(A, 0) would return the DOY of the current map in STDS A. end_hour(A, -1)
       would return the end hour of the previous map in STDS A.

   <b>Comparison</b> <b>operator</b>
       As mentioned above, the conditions are comparison expressions  that  are  used  to  evaluate  space  time
       datasets.  Specific values of temporal variables are compared by logical operators and evaluated for each
       map of the STDS and (optionally) related maps.  For complex relations, the  comparison  operator  can  be
       used to combine conditions.
       The  structure  is  similar  to  the  select  operator  with  the  addition  of  an aggregation operator:
       {"comparison operator", "topological relations", aggregation operator, "temporal operator"}
       This aggregation operator (| or &amp;) defines the behaviour when a map is related to more than one map, e.g.
       for the topological relation ’contains’.  Should all (&amp;) conditions for the related maps be true or is it
       sufficient to have any (|) condition that is true. The resulting boolean value is then  compared  to  the
       first  condition  by the comparison operator (|| or &amp;&amp;).  By default, the aggregation operator is related
       to the comparison operator:
       comparison operator -&gt; aggregation operator:
       || -&gt; | and &amp;&amp; -&gt; &amp;
       <b>Examples:</b>
       Condition 1 {||, equal, r} Condition 2
       Condition 1 {&amp;&amp;, equal|during, l} Condition 2
       Condition 1 {&amp;&amp;, equal|contains, |, l} Condition 2
       Condition 1 {&amp;&amp;, equal|during, l} Condition 2 &amp;&amp; Condition 3
       Condition 1 {&amp;&amp;, equal|during, l} Condition 2 {&amp;&amp;,contains, |, r} Condition 3

   <b>Hash</b> <b>operator</b>
       Additionally, the number of maps in intervals can be computed and used in conditional statements with the
       hash (#) operator.
       A {#, contains} B
       This expression computes the number of maps from space time dataset B which are during the time intervals
       of maps from space time dataset A.
       A list of integers (scalars) corresponding to the maps of A that contain maps from B will be returned.
       C = if({equal}, A {#, contains} B &gt; 2, A {:, contains} B)
       This expression selects all maps from A that temporally contain at least 2 maps from B and stores them in
       space time dataset C. The leading equal statement in the if condition  specifies  the  temporal  relation
       between the if and then part of the if expression. This is very important, so we do not need to specify a
       global time reference (a space time dataset) for temporal processing.

       Furthermore,  the  temporal  algebra  allows temporal buffering, shifting and snapping with the functions
       buff_t(), tshift() and tsnap(), respectively.
       buff_t(A, size)         Buffer STDS A with granule ("1 month" or 5)
       tshift(A, size)         Shift STDS A with granule ("1 month" or 5)
       tsnap(A)                Snap time instances and intervals of STDS A

   <b>Single</b> <b>map</b> <b>with</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>extent</b>
       The temporal algebra can also handle single maps with time stamps in the tmap() function.
       tmap()
       For example:
       C = A {:, during} tmap(event)
       This statement selects all maps from space time data set A that are during the  temporal  extent  of  the
       single map ’event’

   <b>Spatial</b> <b>raster</b> <b>operators</b>
       The module supports the following raster operations:
       Symbol  description     precedence
         %     modulus         1
         /     division        1
         *     multiplication  1
         +     addition        2
         -     subtraction     2
       And raster functions:
       abs(x)                  return absolute value of x
       float(x)                convert x to foating point
       int(x)                  convert x to integer [ truncates ]
       log(x)                  natural log of x
       sqrt(x)                 square root of x
       tan(x)                  tangent of x (x is in degrees)
       round(x)                round x to nearest integer
       sin(x)                  sine of x (x is in degrees)
       isnull(x)               check if x = NULL
       isntnull(x)             check if x is not NULL
       null                    set null value
       exist(x)                Check if x is in the current mapset

   <b>Single</b> <b>raster</b> <b>map</b>
       The  temporal raster algebra features also a function to integrate single raster maps without time stamps
       into the expressions.
       map()
       For example:
       C = A * map(constant_value)
       This statement multiplies all raster maps from  space  time  raster  data  set  A  with  the  raster  map
       ’constant_value’

   <b>Combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>temporal,</b> <b>raster</b> <b>and</b> <b>select</b> <b>operators</b>
       The  user  can  combine  the  temporal  topology relations, the temporal operators and the spatial/select
       operators to create spatio-temporal operators as follows:
       {"spatial or select operator", "list of temporal relations", "temporal operator"}
       For multiple topological relations or several related maps the spatio-temporal operators feature implicit
       aggregation.  The algebra evaluates the stated STDS by their temporal  topologies  and  apply  the  given
       spatio-temporal  operators  in a aggregated form.  If we have two STDS A and B, B has three maps: b1, b2,
       b3 that are all during the temporal extent of the single map a1  of  A,  then  the  following  arithmetic
       calculations would implicitly aggregate all maps of B into one result map for a1 of A:
        C = A {+, contains} B --&gt; c1 = a1 + b1 + b2 + b3

       <b>Important</b>: the aggregation behaviour is not symmetric
        C = B {+, during} A --&gt; c1 = b1 + a1
                                c2 = b2 + a1
                                c3 = b3 + a1

   <b>Temporal</b> <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>modifier</b>
       The  neighbourhood  modifier  of  <u>r.mapcalc</u> is extended for the temporal raster algebra with the temporal
       dimension. The format is strds[t,r,c], where t is the temporal offset, r is the row offset and c  is  the
       column  offset.  A  single  neighborhood  modifier  is  interpreted  as  temporal  offset  [t], while two
       neighborhood modifiers are interpreted as row and column offsets [r,c].
       strds[2]
       refers to the second successor of the current map.

       strds[1,2]
       refers to the cell one row below and two columns to the right of the current cell in the current map.

       strds[1,-2,-1]
       refers to the cell two rows above and one column to the left of the current cell of the  first  successor
       map.

       strds[-2,0,1]
       refers to the cell one column to the right of the current cell in the second predecessor map.

   <b>Sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>space-time</b> <b>raster</b> <b>datasets</b>
       Sum  maps from STRDS A with maps from STRDS B which have equal time stamps and are temporally before Jan.
       1. 2005 and store them in STRDS D:
       D = if(start_date(A) &lt; "2005-01-01", A + B)
       Create the sum of all maps from STRDS A and B that have equal time stamps and store the new maps in STRDS
       C:
       C = A + B

   <b>Sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>space-time</b> <b>raster</b> <b>datasets</b> <b>with</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>topology</b> <b>relation</b>
       Same expression with explicit definition of the temporal topology relation and temporal operators:
       C = A {+,equal,l} B

   <b>Selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>raster</b> <b>cells</b>
       Select all cells from STRDS B with equal temporal relations to STRDS A, if the cells  of  A  are  in  the
       range [100.0, 1600] of time intervals that have more than 30 days (Jan, Mar, May, Jul, Aug, Oct, Dec):
       C = if(A &gt; 100 &amp;&amp; A &lt; 1600 &amp;&amp; td(A) &gt; 30, B)

   <b>Selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>raster</b> <b>cells</b> <b>with</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>topology</b> <b>relation</b>
       Same expression with explicit definition of the temporal topology relation and temporal operators:
       C = if({equal}, A &gt; 100 &amp;&amp; A &lt; 1600 {&amp;&amp;,equal} td(A) &gt; 30, B)

   <b>Conditional</b> <b>computation</b>
       Compute  the  recharge  in  meters  per  second  for  all cells of precipitation STRDS "Prec" if the mean
       temperature specified in STRDS "Temp" is higher than 10 degrees. Computation is performed if STRDS "Prec"
       and "Temp" have equal time stamps. The number of days or fraction of days per interval is computed  using
       the td() function that has as argument the STRDS "Prec":
       C = if(Temp &gt; 10.0, Prec / 3600.0 / 24.0 / td(Prec))

   <b>Conditional</b> <b>computation</b> <b>with</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>topology</b> <b>relation</b>
       Same expression with explicit definition of the temporal topology relation and temporal operators:
       C = if({equal}, Temp &gt; 10.0, Prec / 3600.0 / 24.0 {/,equal,l} td(Prec))

   <b>Computation</b> <b>with</b> <b>time</b> <b>intervals</b>
       Compute the mean value of all maps from STRDS A that are located during time intervals of STRDS B if more
       than  one  map  of  A is contained in an interval of B, use A otherwise. The resulting time intervals are
       either from B or A:
       C = if(B {#,contain} A &gt; 1, (B {+,contain,l} A - B) / (B {#,contain} A), A)

   <b>Computation</b> <b>with</b> <b>time</b> <b>intervals</b> <b>with</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>topology</b> <b>relation</b>
       Same expression with explicit definition of the temporal topology relation and temporal operators:
       C = if({equal}, B {#,contain} A &gt; 1, (B {+,contain,l} A {-,equal,l} B) {equal,=/} (B {#,contain} A), A)

   <b>Compute</b> <b>DOY</b> <b>for</b> <b>spatio-temporal</b> <b>conditions</b>
       Compute the DOY for all maps from STRDS A where conditions are met at three  consecutive  time  intervals
       (e.g. temperature &gt; 0):
       B = if(A &gt; 0.0 &amp;&amp; A[-1] &gt; 0.0 &amp;&amp; A[-2] &gt; 0.0, start_doy(A, -1), 0)"
