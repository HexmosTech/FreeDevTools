</pre><h4><b>Name</b></h4><pre>
       floppyd - floppy daemon for remote access to floppy drive

</pre><h4><b>Note</b> <b>of</b> <b>warning</b></h4><pre>
       This  manpage  has  been  automatically  generated  from  mtools's  texinfo documentation, and may not be
       entirely accurate or complete.  See the end of this man page for details.

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       Floppyd is used as a server to grant access to the floppy drive to clients running on a  remote  machine,
       just as an X server grants access to the display to remote clients.  It has the following syntax:

       floppyd [-d] [-D] [-l] [-s <u>port</u>] [-r <u>user</u>] [-b <u>ipaddr</u>] [-x <u>display</u>] <u>devicenames</u>

       floppyd  is always associated with an X server.  It runs on the same machine as its X server, and listens
       on port 5703 and above.

</pre><h4><b>Authentication</b></h4><pre>
       floppyd authenticates  remote  clients  using  the  Xauthority  protocol.  Xhost  authentication  is  not
       supported.  Each  floppyd  is  associated  with an X server.  When a remote client attempts to connect to
       floppyd, it sends floppyd the X authority record corresponding to floppyd's X server.   Floppyd  in  turn
       then  tries  to  open  up  a  connection to the X server in order to verify the authenticity of the xauth
       record.  If the connection to the X server succeeds, the client is granted access.  DISPLAY.

       <b>Caution</b>: In order to make authentication work correctly, the local host should <b>not</b> be listed in the xhost
       list of allowed hosts.
        Indeed, hosts listed in xhost do not need a correct Xauthority cookie to connect to  the  X  server.  As
       floppyd  runs  on  the same host as the X server, all its probe connection would succeed even for clients
       who supplied a bad cookie.  This means that your floppy drive would be open to the  world,  i.e.  a  huge
       security hole.
        If  your  X  server does not allow you to remove localhost:0 and :0 from the xhost list, you can prevent
       floppyd from probing those display names with the -l option.

</pre><h4><b>Command</b> <b>line</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       d      Server mode. Floppyd runs its own server loop.  Do not supply  this  if  you  start  floppyd  from
              inetd.conf

       D      Do not daemonize. Floppyd will not put itself into the background even if started in server mode.

       s  <u>port</u>
              Port  number  for  daemon  mode.  Default is 5703 + <u>displaynumber</u>.  This flag implies daemon mode.
              For example, for display hitchhiker:5, the port would be 5708.

       b  <u>ipaddr</u>
              Bind address (for multi homed hosts). This flag implies daemon mode

       r <u>user</u>
              Run the server under as the given user

       x <u>display</u>
              X display to use for authentication. By default, this is  taken  from  the  DISPLAY  variable.  If
              neither the x attribute is present nor DISPLAY is set, floppyd uses :0.0.

       <u>devicenames</u>  is  a  list  of  device  nodes to be opened.  Default is /dev/fd0. Multiple devices are only
       supported on mtools versions newer than 3.9.11.

</pre><h4><b>Connecting</b> <b>to</b> <b>floppyd</b></h4><pre>
        In order to use floppyd, add the flag remote to the device description in your `<a href="file:~/.mtoolsrc">~/.mtoolsrc</a>'  file.   If
       the  flag  remote is given, the file parameter of the device description is taken to be a remote address.
       It's format is the following: <u>hostname</u>:<u>displaynumber</u>[/[<u>baseport</u>][/<u>drive</u>]]. When using this entry,  mtools
       connects  to port <u>baseport</u>+<u>displaynumber</u> at <u>hostname</u>. By default <u>baseport</u> is 5703. The drive parameter is
       to distinguish among multiple drives associated with a single display (only mtools versions  more  recent
       than 3.9.11)

</pre><h4><b>Examples:</b></h4><pre>
        The  following  starts  a floppy daemon giving access to `/dev/fd0', listening on the default port 5703,
       tied to the default X servers:

          <b>floppyd</b> <b>-d</b> <b>/dev/fd0</b>

        Each of the following starts a floppy daemon giving access  to  `/dev/fd1',  tied  to  the  :1  local  X
       servers, and listening on port 5704. We assume that the local host is named hitchhiker.

          <b>floppyd</b> <b>-d</b> <b>/dev/fd0</b>
          <b>floppyd</b> <b>-d</b> <b>-x</b> <b>:1</b> <b>-p</b> <b>5704</b> <b>/dev/fd0</b>

        If you want to start floppyd by inetd instead of running it as a daemon, insert the following lines into
       `<a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a>':

          <b>#</b> <b>floppy</b> <b>daemon</b>
          <b>floppyd-0</b>    <b>5703/tcp</b>    <b>#</b> <b>floppy</b> <b>daemon</b> <b>for</b> <b>X</b> <b>server</b> <b>:0</b>
          <b>floppyd-1</b>    <b>5704/tcp</b>    <b>#</b> <b>floppy</b> <b>daemon</b> <b>for</b> <b>X</b> <b>server</b> <b>:1</b>

        And  insert  the following into `/etc/inetd.conf' (assuming that you have defined a user named floppy in
       your `<a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>'):

          <b>#</b> <b>floppy</b> <b>daemon</b>
          <b>floppyd-0</b> <b>stream</b>  <b>tcp</b>  <b>wait</b>  <b>floppy</b>  <b>/usr/sbin/floppyd</b> <b>floppyd</b> <b>/dev/fd0</b>
          <b>floppyd-1</b> <b>stream</b>  <b>tcp</b>  <b>wait</b>  <b>floppy</b>  <b>/usr/sbin/floppyd</b> <b>floppyd</b> <b>-x</b> <b>:1</b> <b>/dev/fd0</b>

        Note that you need to supply the X display names for the second floppyd.  This is because  the  port  is
       opened by inetd.conf, and hence floppyd cannot know its number to interfere the display number.

       On  the  client  side,  insert  the  following into your `<a href="file:~/.mtoolsrc">~/.mtoolsrc</a>' to define a drive letter accessing
       floppy drive in your X terminal:

          <b>drive</b> <b>x:</b> <b>file="$DISPLAY"</b> <b>remote</b>

       If your X terminal has more than one drive, you may access the additional drives as follows:

          <b>drive</b> <b>y:</b> <b>file="$DISPLAY//1"</b> <b>remote</b>
          <b>drive</b> <b>z:</b> <b>file="$DISPLAY//2"</b> <b>remote</b>

</pre><h4><b>Viewing</b> <b>the</b> <b>texi</b> <b>doc</b></h4><pre>
       This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo documentation. However, this  process
       is  only  approximative,  and some items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
       translation process.  Indeed, these items have no  appropriate  representation  in  the  manpage  format.
       Moreover,  not  all information has been translated into the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you
       to use the original texinfo doc.  See the end of this manpage for instructions how to  view  the  texinfo
       doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run the following commands:

                     <b>./configure;</b> <b>make</b> <b>dvi;</b> <b>dvips</b> <b>mtools.dvi</b>

       *      To generate a html copy,  run:

                     <b>./configure;</b> <b>make</b> <b>html</b>

       A premade html can be found at `<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/manual/mtools.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/manual/mtools.html</a>'

       *      To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs' info mode), run:

                     <b>./configure;</b> <b>make</b> <b>info</b>

       The  texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in the info version certain examples
       are difficult to read due to the quoting conventions used in info.
