</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       siege - An HTTP/FTP load tester and benchmarking utility.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         siege [options]
         siege [options] &lt;URL&gt;
         siege [options] -g &lt;URL&gt;
         siege [options] -f urls.txt

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       siege is a multi-threaded HTTP/FTP load tester and benchmarking utility. It supports most of the features
       detailed in RFCs 2616 (HTTP) and 959 (FTP). Properties can be set both from the command line and in a
       configuration file. When the same property is set in both locations, the command line takes precedence.

       The default configuration file is $HOME/.siege/siege.conf If you don't have a $HOME/.siege directory and
       a siege.conf and cookies.txt file, siege will generate a new config directory when it runs. You can
       generate your config directory with the following command: siege.config

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Option</b> <b>Syntax</b>
       siege supports long and short options. Short options look like this:
           -c 25
           -c25

       Long options look like this:
           --concurrent=25

   <b>Option</b> <b>Values</b>
       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
           Displays the siege release version and copyright information.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Prints a help message describing siege's command-line options.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--config</b>
           Prints  a  detailed  summary  of  all  the  currently  configured  options, most of which are sent in
           $HOME/.siege/siege.conf

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           This directive puts siege into verbose mode which is actually a default  setting.  This  command-line
           option is useful when the config file is set to 'verbose = false' since it will allow you to override
           that.

           By default siege's verbose output is displayed in a color-coded style.
             * HTTP 2xx is coded blue
             * HTTP 3xx is coded cyan
             * HTTP 4xx is coded magenta
             * HTTP 5xx is coded red
             * HTTP cached is coded black

           NOTE: You can turn off color in siege.conf like this: 'color = off'

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
           This  directive silences siege. It is mostly used for scripting and is often used in conjunction with
           -g/--get. You can detect the success or failure of the run with its exit code.

             siege --quiet -g www.joedog.org
             if [ $? -eq 0 ] ; then
               echo "Success"
             else
               echo "Failure"
             fi

       <b>-g</b> <b>URL</b>, <b>--get=URL</b>
           This option allows you to request a URL and watch the header transaction.  There is  a  corresponding
           config  file  directive  that  allows  you  to  set  the request method for these requests: gmethod =
           HEAD|GET

             $ siege -g "https://www.joedog.org/"
             HEAD / HTTP/1.0
             Host: www.joedog.org

           NOTE: It's a best practice to quote the URL when it's passed to siege from the the command-line.

       <b>-p</b> <b>URL</b>, <b>--print=URL</b>
           This option is similar to -g / --get but it PRINTS the page it received from the server.

             $ siege -p <a href="http://www.joedog.org/">http://www.joedog.org/</a>

             &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

       <b>-c</b> <b>NUM</b>, <b>--concurrent=NUM</b>
           This option allows you to set  the  concurrent  number  of  users.  The  total  number  of  users  is
           technically limited to your computer's resources.

           You  should  not  configure more users than your web server is configured to handle. For example, the
           default apache configuration is capped at 255 threads. If you run siege with -c 1024, then 769  siege
           users are left waiting for an apache handler.

           For  this  reason,  the  default  siege  configuration is capped at 255 users.  You can increase that
           number inside siege.conf but if you make a mess, then please don't complain to us.

       <b>-r</b> <b>NUM</b>, <b>--reps=NUM|once</b>
           This option tells each siege user how many times it should run.  The  value  should  generally  be  a
           number greater than zero but it may be the keyword 'once'.

           If --reps=3 then each siege user will run three times before it exits.  However, if --reps=once, then
           each user will run through the urls.txt file exactly one time.

           For more information about the urls.txt file, see option -f &lt;file&gt;, --file=&lt;file&gt;

       <b>-t</b> <b>NUMm</b>, <b>--time=NUMm</b>
           This  option is similar to --reps but instead of specifying the number of times each user should run,
           it specifies the amount of time each should run.

           The value format is "NUMm", where "NUM" is an amount of time and the "m" modifier is either S, M,  or
           H for seconds, minutes and hours. To run siege for an hour, you could select any one of the following
           combinations: -t3600S, -t60M, -t1H.  The modifier is not case sensitive, but it does require no space
           between the number and itself.

       <b>-d</b> <b>NUM</b>, <b>--delay=NUM</b>
           This  option  instructs  siege how long to delay between each page request.  The value NUM represents
           the number of seconds between each one. This number can be a decimal value. In fact  the  default  is
           half a second (--delay=0.5).

           The  time  between  delay  requests  is  NOT  applied  toward the transaction time. If two 0.1 second
           transactions have a 2 second delay between them, their average transaction time is 0.1 seconds. It is
           applied toward the total elapsed time. In this scenario, the elapsed time would be 2.2 seconds.

           NOTE: when the parser is enabled (see: -p/--parser), there is no  delay  between  the  page  and  its
           elements, i.e., style sheets, javascripts, etc.  The delay is only between page requests.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--benchmark</b>
           This  directive  tells  siege  to  go  into  benchmark  mode.  This  means  there is no delay between
           iterations.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--internet</b>
           This option sets siege into what we call internet mode. It makes  requests  from  the  urls.txt  file
           (see: -f &lt;file&gt; / --file=&lt;file&gt;) in random order.

       <b>-f</b> <b>FILE</b>, <b>--file=FILE</b>
           This  option  tells siege to work with a list of urls inside a text file. The URLs are listed one per
           line. Unlike URLs that are passed as a command-line argument, the URLs in this  file  should  not  be
           quoted.

           siege's  urls.txt  parser  supports comments and variables. Since siege uses the dollar sign ($) as a
           prefix for scalar variables, you should escape any variable you want to send to the server:

             https://$(HOST)/siege/jsoner.php POST {"price": "\$10 per mile"}

       <b>-R</b> <b>FILE</b>, <b>--rc=FILE</b>
           This directive allows you to set an alternative resource  file.  By  default,  the  siegerc  file  is
           $HOME/.siege/siege.conf  With  this  directive,  you  can override the default and use an alternative
           file.

       <b>-L</b> <b>FILE</b>, <b>--log=FILE</b>
           The default  log  file  is  $prefix/var/log/siege.log.  This  directive  allows  you  to  specify  an
           alternative file for logging.

       <b>-m</b> <b>"string"</b>, <b>--mark="string"</b>
           This  option  allows  you to log a message to the log file before your stats are written there. It is
           generally used to identify the proceeding run. You could,  for  example,  mark  the  file  with  your
           command-line parameters so it's understood what configuration generated the following data.

       <b>-H</b> <b>"header:</b> <b>value"</b>, <b>--header="Header:</b> <b>value"</b>
           This  options allows you to set a custom header in the request.  Generally speaking, this header will
           override an existing header. The Cookie header is a special case.  If you set -H "Cookie: value" then
           siege will send that cookie in addition to the other ones.

       <b>-A</b> <b>"string"</b>, <b>--agent="string"</b>
           This option allows you to override the default user-agent with a custom one.

             siege --agent="JoeDog Jr. in da hizzle"

           Will set this header:

             User-agent: JoeDog Jr. in da hizzle

           Alternatively, you could set the User-agent with the -H/--header option above.

       <b>-T</b> <b>"text"</b>, <b>--content-type="text"</b>
           This is another set header shortcut. You use this option to override the default Content-type request
           header.

       <b>--no-parser</b>
           Turn off the HTML parser. When siege downloads a page, it parses it for additional page elements such
           as style-sheets, javascript and images. It will make additional requests for any elements  it  finds.
           With this option enabled, siege will stop after it pulls down the main page.

       <b>--no-follow</b>
           This directive instructs siege not to follow 3xx redirects.

</pre><h4><b>URL</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       siege  supports  RFC  1738  URL  formats but it takes pains to implement commonly used shortcuts for your
       convenience. In addition to RFC 1738 formats, siege introduces its own URL format  to  indicate  protocol
       method.

       An RFC 1738 URL looks like this:
         &lt;scheme&gt;://&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;path&gt;;&lt;params&gt;?&lt;query&gt;#&lt;frag&gt;

       A siege URL with a method indicator looks like this:
         &lt;scheme&gt;://&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;path&gt; POST &lt;query&gt;

       You can also post the contents of a file using the redirect character like this:
         &lt;scheme&gt;://&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;path&gt; POST &lt;/home/jeff/haha.txt

       Here are two examples with the siege method indicator:
         <a href="http://www.joedog.org/">http://www.joedog.org/</a> POST haha=papa&amp;dada=mama
         <a href="ftp://ftp.armstrong.com/">ftp://ftp.armstrong.com/</a> PUT &lt;/home/jdfulmer/etc/tests/bbc.jpg

       NOTE:  If  you set URLs with method indicators at the command-line, then you MUST quote the thing or your
       shell will treat it like three separate arguments. If the URL is in a urls.txt file, then  you  shouldn't
       quote it.

       As mentioned above, siege goes to great lengths to allow commonly used shortcuts that you're used to from
       most  browser  implementations.   It  treats many parts of the 1738 URL as optional. In this example, the
       parts in brackets are optional:
         [scheme://] host.domain.xxx [:port] [/path/file]

       When siege receives a host name it builds the  URL  with  default  assumptions.   www.joedog.org  becomes
       <a href="http://www.joedog.org">http://www.joedog.org</a>:80/

</pre><h4><b>URLS.txt</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       From  the  section called Option Syntax above we learn that siege can take a URL as an argument. siege -c
       -r2 www.joedog.org will request the JoeDog index page twice.  But what if you want to hit large  portions
       of the site? siege will allow you to fill a file with URLs so that it can run through list.

       The format for the file is one URL per line:
         https://www.joedog.org/
         https://www.joedog.org/haha/
         https://www.joedog.org/haha/ POST homer=simpson&amp;marge=doestoo

       The file also supports UNIX-style commenting:
         # Comment looks like this
         https://www.joedog.org/
         https://www.joedog.org/haha/
         https://www.joedog.org/haha/ POST homer=simpson&amp;marge=doestoo

       It  supports  shell-style  variable declaration and references. This is convenient if you want to run the
       same test on two different tiers or two different schemes:

         SCHEME=https
         HOST=bart.joedog.org
         $(SCHEME)://$(HOST)/
         $(SCHEME)://$(HOST)/haha/
         $(SCHEME)://$(HOST)/haha/ POST homer=simpson&amp;marge=doestoo

       You can tell siege about this file with the -f/--file option:
         siege -c1 -r50 -f /home/jeff/urls.txt

</pre><h4><b>PERFORMANCE</b> <b>STATISTICS</b></h4><pre>
       When its run is complete, siege will gather performance data from all  its  clients  and  summarize  them
       after  the  run.  (You  can  also  choose to log these numbers). The command-line output is modeled after
       Lincoln Stein's torture.pl script:

         Transactions:                   2000 hits
         Availability:                 100.00 %
         Elapsed time:                  58.57 secs
         Data transferred:               5.75 MB
         Response time:                  0.25 secs
         Transaction rate:              34.15 trans/sec
         Throughput:                     0.10 MB/sec
         Concurrency:                    8.45
         Successful transactions:        2000
         Failed transactions:               0
         Longest transaction:            4.62
         Shortest transaction:           0.00

         Transactions
             This number represents the total number of HTTP requests. In this
             example, we ran 25 simulated users [-c25] and each ran ten times
             [-r10]. Twenty-five times ten equals 250 so why is the transaction
             total 2000? That's because siege counts every request. This run
             included a META redirect, a 301 redirect and the page it requested
             contained several elements that were also downloaded.

         Availability
             This is the percentage of socket connections successfully handled
             by the server. It is the result of socket failures (including
             timeouts) divided by the sum of all connection attempts. This
             number does not include 400 and 500 level server errors which are
             recorded in "Failed transactions" described below.

         Elapsed time
             The duration of the entire siege test. This is measured from the
             time the user invokes siege until the last simulated user
             completes its transactions. Shown above, the test took 58.57
             seconds to complete.

         Data transferred
             The sum of data transferred to every siege simulated user. It
             includes the header information as well as content. Because it
             includes header information, the number reported by siege will
             be larger then the number reported by the server. In internet
             mode, which hits random URLs in a configuration file, this
             number is expected to vary from run to run.

         Response time
             The average time it took to respond to each simulated user's requests.

         Transaction rate
             The average number of transactions the server was able to handle
             per second, in a nutshell: it is the count of all transactions
             divided by elapsed time.

         Throughput
             The average number of bytes transferred every second from the
             server to all the simulated users.

         Concurrency
             This is the average number of simultaneous connections. The metric
             is calculated like this: the sum of all transaction times divided
             by elapsed time (how long siege ran)

         Successful transactions
             The number of times the server responded with a return code &lt; 400.

         Failed transactions
             The number of times the socket transactions failed which includes
             socket timeouts.

         Longest transaction
             The greatest amount of time that any single transaction took, out
             of all transactions.

         Shortest transaction
             The smallest amount of time that any single transaction took, out
             of all transactions.
