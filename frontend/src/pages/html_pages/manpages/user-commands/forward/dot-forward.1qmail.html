</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dot-forward - read a .forward file under qmail

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       in <b><a href="file:~/.qmail">~/.qmail</a></b>: <b>|</b> <b>dot-forward</b> [ <b>-nN</b> ] <u>file</u> <u>...</u>

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dot-forward</b>  forwards incoming messages according to sendmail-style instructions in <u>file</u>, if <u>file</u> exists.
       Normally <u>file</u> is <b>.forward</b>.

       <b>WARNING:</b> If you create a <b>.qmail</b> file to enable <b>dot-forward</b>, make sure to add  a  second  line  specifying
       delivery to your normal mailbox.  For example:

          |dot-forward .forward
          ./Mailbox

       <b>COMPATIBILITY</b>  <b>WARNING:</b>  <b>dot-forward</b>  does  not  support  <b>:include:</b>  or mbox deliveries.  You can use the
       delivery mechanism described in <b><a href="../man5/dot-qmail.5.html">dot-qmail</a></b>(5) instead.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-N</b>   (Default.)  Read and forward a message.

       <b>-n</b>   Parse <u>file</u> and  print  the  forwarding  instructions  in  it,  one  per  line;  do  not  follow  the
            instructions.   You  can use this option from the command line to see how your <b>.forward</b> file will be
            interpreted:

               dot-forward -n .forward

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>HANDLING</b></h4><pre>
       When a message arrives, <b>dot-forward</b> opens <u>file</u> and handles it as discussed below.  It exits 99, so <b>qmail-</b>
       <b>local</b> will ignore further instructions in <b>.qmail</b>.  Exception: If <u>file</u> specifies delivery directly to you,
       <b>dot-forward</b> exits 0, so <b>qmail-local</b> will read further instructions in <b>.qmail</b>.

       If <u>file</u> does not exist, <b>dot-forward</b> exits 0.  You can list several <u>file</u>s; then <b>dot-forward</b> will try  each
       one in turn, using the first one that exists, or exiting 0 if none exist.

       <b>COMPATIBILITY</b>  <b>WARNING:</b>  <b>dot-forward</b>  treats  an empty <u>file</u> as if it did not exist.  Versions of sendmail
       before V8 would throw away the incoming message.

       <b>COMPATIBILITY</b> <b>WARNING:</b> If <b>dot-forward</b> encounters a temporary error opening <u>file</u>, it exits  111,  so  that
       <b>qmail-local</b> will try again later.  sendmail assumes incorrectly that <u>file</u> does not exist.

       <b>COMPATIBILITY</b>  <b>WARNING:</b>  <u>file</u>  must  be  readable  by <b>dot-forward</b>, which is normally running as the user.
       sendmail places different constraints on its <b>.forward</b> permissions, since it is normally running as root.

</pre><h4><b>FORWARDING</b></h4><pre>
       Normally <u>file</u> contains an address.  <b>dot-forward</b> forwards the message to that address.

       The address is parsed as if it were in an RFC 822 message header.  Parenthesized comments  and  bracketed
       addresses are permitted:

          bob (Bob, the postmaster) @heaven.af.mil

       Addresses with special characters must be quoted:

          "spaced out mailbox"@heaven.af.mil

       Address groups are not permitted.

       <u>file</u> can contain any number of lines, each line containing any number of addresses.  <b>dot-forward</b> forwards
       the message to each address:

          bob, fred, susan
          Joe Shmoe &lt;<a href="mailto:shmoe@heaven.af.mil">shmoe@heaven.af.mil</a>&gt;

       An  address without a fully qualified domain name is handled as described in <b><a href="../man5/qmail-header.5.html">qmail-header</a></b>(5).  Exception:
       Certain addresses without domain names are handled specially, as described below.

</pre><h4><b>DIRECT</b> <b>DELIVERY</b></h4><pre>
       If an address does not contain a domain name, and matches the environment variable <b>$USER</b> (without  regard
       to case), it specifies delivery directly to you.

       If an address matches <b>$USER@$HOST</b> (without regard to case), it specifies delivery directly to you.

       <b>COMPATIBILITY</b> <b>WARNING:</b> sendmail's handling of quotes and backslashes violates RFC 821 and RFC 822, and is
       not  supported  by  <b>dot-forward</b>.   <b>dot-forward</b>  treats  <b>\joe</b> the same way as <b>joe</b>.  The <b>dot-qmail</b> delivery
       mechanism lets each user manage several addresses, so there is no need for a special syntax to get around
       forwarding.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       If an address does not contain a domain name, and begins with a vertical bar, <b>dot-forward</b> takes the  rest
       of the address as a command to run:

          bob, "|vacation bob"

       <b>dot-forward</b> feeds the message to the command, preceded by the environment variables <b>$UFLINE</b>, <b>$RPLINE</b>, and
       <b>$DTLINE</b>.

       <b>COMPATIBILITY</b>  <b>WARNING:</b>  Internet  addresses  can  legitimately start with a slash or vertical bar.  <b>dot-</b>
       <b>forward</b> treats anything with an unquoted @ as an address.  sendmail  appears  to  have  various  problems
       coping with these addresses, and with commands that contain @ signs.

</pre><h4><b>COMMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Any line in <u>file</u> that begins with # is ignored:

          # this is a comment

       <b>COMPATIBILITY</b> <b>WARNING:</b> Versions of sendmail before V8 did not allow comments in <b>.forward</b> files.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This is <b>dot-forward</b> 0.71.  The <b>dot-forward</b> home page is <b><a href="http://pobox.com/~djb/dot-forward.html">http://pobox.com/~djb/dot-forward.html</a></b>.
