       perlgov - Perl Rules of Governance

</pre><h4><b>PREAMBLE</b></h4><pre>
       We are forming a system of governance for development of the Perl programming language.

       The scope of governance includes the language definition, its implementation, its test suite, its
       documentation, and the policies and procedures by which it is developed and maintained.

       The system of governance includes definitions of the groups that will make decisions, the rules by which
       these groups are formed and changed, and the enumerated powers and constraints on the activities of these
       governing groups.

       In forming a system of governance, we seek to achieve the following goals:

       •   We  want  a system that is functional.  That means the governing groups may decide to undertake large
           changes, or they may decide  to  act  conservatively,  but  they  will  act  with  intent  and  clear
           communication rather than fail to reach decisions when needed.

       •   We  want  a  system  that is trusted. That means that a reasonable contributor to Perl might disagree
           with decisions made by the governing groups, but will accept that they were made  in  good  faith  in
           consultation with relevant communities outside the governing groups.

       •   We want a system that is sustainable.  That means it has provisions to self-modify, including ways of
           adding  new  members  to the governing groups, ways to survive members becoming inactive, and ways of
           amending the rules of governance themselves if needed.

       •   We want a system that is transparent.  That means that it will prefer policies that  manage  ordinary
           matters in public, and it will prefer secrecy in a limited number of situations.

       •   We  want a system that is respectful.  That means that it will establish standards of civil discourse
           that allow for healthy disagreement but avoid rancor and hostility in the community for which  it  is
           responsible.

</pre><h4><b>Mandate</b></h4><pre>
       Perl language governance shall work to:

       •   Maintain the quality, stability, and continuity of the Perl language and interpreter

       •   Guide the evolution of the Perl language and interpreter

       •   Establish  and  oversee  the policies, procedures, systems, and mechanisms that enable a community of
           contributors to the Perl language and interpreter

       •   Encourage discussion and consensus among contributors as preferential to formal  decision  making  by
           governance groups

       •   Facilitate communication between contributors and external stakeholders in the broader Perl ecosystem

</pre><h4><b>Definitions</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes three roles involved in governance:

       "Core Team"
       "Steering Council"
       "Vote Administrator"

       A section on each follows.

   <b>The</b> <b>Core</b> <b>Team</b>
       The  Core Team are a group of trusted volunteers involved in the ongoing development of the Perl language
       and interpreter.  They are not required to be language developers or committers.

       References to specific votes are explained in the "Rules for Voting" section.

       <u>Powers</u>

       In addition to their contributions to the Perl language, the Core Team sets the rules of Perl governance,
       decides who participates in what role in governance, and delegates substantial decision making  power  to
       the Steering Council.

       Specifically:

       •   They elect the Steering Council and have the power to remove Steering Council members.

       •   In concert with the Steering Council, they manage Core Team membership.

       •   In concert with the Steering Council, they have the power to modify the Perl Rules of Governance.

       The  Core  Team  do  not  have any authority over parts of the Perl ecosystem unrelated to developing and
       releasing the language itself.  These include, but are not limited to:

       •   The Perl Foundation

       •   CPAN administration and CPAN authors

       •   perl.org, metacpan.org, and other community-maintained websites and services

       •   Perl conferences and events, except those organized directly by the Core Team

       •   Perl-related intellectual property legally owned by third-parties, except as  allowed  by  applicable
           licenses or agreements

       <u>Membership</u>

       The initial Core Team members will be specified when this document is first ratified.

       Any  Core  Team member may nominate someone to be added to the Core Team by sending the nomination to the
       Steering Council.  The Steering Council must approve or reject the nomination.  If approved, the Steering
       Council will organize a Membership Change Vote to ratify the addition.

       Core Team members should demonstrate:

       •   A solid track record of being constructive and helpful

       •   Significant contributions to the project's goals, in any form

       •   Willingness to dedicate some time to improving Perl

       Contributions are not limited to code. Here is an incomplete list of areas  where  contributions  may  be
       considered for joining the Core Team:

       •   Working on community management and outreach

       •   Providing support on mailing lists, IRC, or other forums

       •   Triaging tickets

       •   Writing patches (code, docs, or tests)

       •   Reviewing patches (code, docs, or tests)

       •   Participating in design discussions

       •   Providing expertise in a particular domain (security, i18n, etc.)

       •   Managing Perl infrastructure (websites, CI, documentation, etc.)

       •   Maintaining significant projects in the Perl ecosystem

       •   Creating visual designs

       Core  Team membership acknowledges sustained and valuable efforts that align well with the philosophy and
       the goals of the Perl project.

       Core Team members are expected to act as role models for the community and custodians of the project,  on
       behalf of the community and all those who rely on Perl.

       <u>Term</u>

       Core Team members serve until they are removed.

       <u>Removal</u>

       Core Team Members may resign their position at any time.

       In  exceptional  circumstances,  it  may  be necessary to remove someone from the Core Team against their
       will, such as for flagrant or repeated violations of a Code of Conduct.  Any Core Team member may send  a
       recall  request  to  the Steering Council naming the individual to be removed.  The Steering Council must
       approve or reject the recall request.  If approved, the  Steering  Council  will  organize  a  Membership
       Change vote to ratify the removal.

       If the removed member is also on the Steering Council, then they are removed from the Steering Council as
       well.

       <u>Inactivity</u>

       Core Team members who have stopped contributing are encouraged to declare themselves "inactive". Inactive
       members do not nominate or vote.  Inactive members may declare themselves active at any time, except when
       a vote has been proposed and is not concluded.  Eligibility to nominate or vote will be determined by the
       Vote Administrator.

       To  record and honor their contributions, inactive Core Team members will continue to be listed alongside
       active members.

       <u>No</u> <u>Confidence</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>Steering</u> <u>Council</u>

       The Core Team may remove either a single Steering Council member or the entire Steering Council via a  No
       Confidence Vote.

       A  No  Confidence  Vote  is  triggered  when  a Core Team member calls for one publicly on an appropriate
       project communication channel, and another Core Team member seconds the proposal.

       If a No Confidence Vote removes all Steering Council members, the Vote Administrator of the No Confidence
       Vote will then administer an election to select a new Steering Council.

       <u>Amending</u> <u>Perl</u> <u>Rules</u> <u>of</u> <u>Governance</u>

       Any Core Team member may propose amending the Perl Rules of Governance  by  sending  a  proposal  to  the
       Steering  Council.  The Steering Council must decide to approve or reject the proposal.  If approved, the
       Steering Council will organize an Amendment Vote.

       <u>Rules</u> <u>for</u> <u>Voting</u>

       Membership Change, Amendment, and No Confidence Votes require 2/3 of participating votes from  Core  Team
       members to pass.

       A Vote Administrator must be selected following the rules in the "Vote Administrator" section.

       The vote occurs in two steps:

       1.  The  Vote  Administrator describes the proposal being voted upon.  The Core Team then may discuss the
           matter in advance of voting.

       2.  Active Core Team members vote in favor or against the proposal.  Voting is performed anonymously.

       For a Membership Change Vote, each phase will last one week.  For Amendment and No Confidence Votes, each
       phase will last two weeks.

   <b>The</b> <b>Steering</b> <b>Council</b>
       The Steering Council is a 3-person committee, elected by the Core Team.  Candidates are not  required  to
       be  members  of  the  Core  Team.  Non-member candidates are added to the Core Team if elected as if by a
       Membership Change Vote.

       References to specific elections are explained in the "Rules for Elections" section.

       <u>Powers</u>

       The Steering Council has broad authority to make decisions about the development of  the  Perl  language,
       the  interpreter,  and  all  other  components,  systems and processes that result in new releases of the
       language interpreter.

       For example, it can:

       •   Manage the schedule and process for shipping new releases

       •   Establish procedures for proposing, discussing and deciding upon changes to the language

       •   Delegate power to individuals on or outside the Steering Council

       Decisions of the Steering Council will be made by majority vote of non-vacant seats on the council.

       The Steering Council should look for ways to use these powers as little as possible.  Instead of  voting,
       it's better to seek consensus. Instead of ruling on individual cases, it's better to define standards and
       processes that apply to all cases.

       As  with the Core Team, the Steering Council does not have any authority over parts of the Perl ecosystem
       unrelated to developing and releasing the language itself.

       The Steering Council does not have the power to modify the Perl Rules of Governance, except  as  provided
       in the section "Amending Perl Rules of Governance".

       <u>Term</u>

       A  new  Steering  Council  will  be chosen by a Term Election after each stable feature release (that is,
       change to "PERL_REVISION" or "PERL_VERSION") or after two years, whichever comes first. The Term Election
       will be organized within two weeks of the triggering event. The council  members  will  serve  until  the
       completion of the next Term Election unless they are removed.

       <u>Removal</u>

       Steering Council members may resign their position at any time.

       Whenever there are vacancies on the Steering Council, the council will organize a Special Election within
       one  week  after the vacancy occurs.  If the entire Steering Council is ever vacant, a Term Election will
       be held instead.

       The Steering Council may defer the Special Election for up to twelve weeks.  Their intent to do  so  must
       be publicly stated to the Core Team.  If any active Core Team member objects within one week, the Special
       Election  must be organized within two weeks.  At any time, the Steering Council may choose to cancel the
       deferment and immediately commence organizing a Special Election.

       If a Steering Council member is deceased, or drops out of touch and cannot be contacted for  a  month  or
       longer,  then the rest of the council may vote to declare their seat vacant.  If an absent member returns
       after such a declaration is made, they are not reinstated automatically,  but  may  run  in  the  Special
       Election to fill the vacancy.

       Otherwise,  Steering  Council  members  may  only  be  removed  before the end of their term through a No
       Confidence Vote by the Core Team.

       <u>Rules</u> <u>for</u> <u>Elections</u>

       Term and Special Election are ranked-choice votes to construct an ordered  list  of  candidates  to  fill
       vacancies in the Steering Council.

       A Vote Administrator must be selected following the rules in the "Vote Administrator" section.

       Both Term and Special Elections occur in two stages:

       1.  Candidates  advertise  their interest in serving. Candidates must be nominated by an active Core Team
           member. Self-nominations are allowed.   Nominated  candidates  may  share  a  statement  about  their
           candidacy with the Core Team.

       2.  If  there  are  no  more  candidates  than  open  seats, no vote is required.  The candidates will be
           declared to have won when the nomination period ends.

           Otherwise, active Core Team Members vote by ranking all candidates.  Voting is performed anonymously.
           After voting is complete, candidates  are  ranked  using  the  Condorcet  Internet  Voting  Service's
           proportional  representation mode.  If a tie occurs, it may be resolved by mutual agreement among the
           tied candidates, or else the tie will be resolved through random selection by the Vote Administrator.

       Anyone voted off the Core Team is not eligible to be a candidate for Steering Council unless  re-instated
       to the Core Team.

       For  a  Term  Election,  each  phase  will last two weeks.  At the end of the second phase, the top three
       ranked candidates are elected as the new Steering Council.

       For a Special Election, each phase will last one week.  At the end of the  second  phase,  vacancies  are
       filled from the ordered list of candidates until no vacancies remain.

       The  election  of  the  first  Steering Council will be a Term Election.  Ricardo Signes will be the Vote
       Administrator for the initial Term Election unless he is a candidate, in which case he will select a non-
       candidate administrator to replace him.

   <b>The</b> <b>Vote</b> <b>Administrator</b>
       Every election or vote requires a Vote Administrator who  manages  communication,  collection  of  secret
       ballots, and all other necessary activities to complete the voting process.

       Unless otherwise specified, the Steering Council selects the Vote Administrator.

       A Vote Administrator must not be a member of the Steering Council nor a candidate or subject of the vote.
       A  Vote  Administrator may be a member of the Core Team and, if so, may cast a vote while also serving as
       administrator.  If the Vote Administrator becomes a candidate during an election vote, they will  appoint
       a non-candidate replacement.

       If  the  entire  Steering Council is vacant or is the subject of a No Confidence Vote, then the Core Team
       will select a Vote Administrator by consensus.  If consensus cannot  be  reached  within  one  week,  the
       President of The Perl Foundation will select a Vote Administrator.

</pre><h4><b>Steering</b> <b>Council</b> <b>and</b> <b>Core</b> <b>Team</b> <b>Members</b></h4><pre>
       The  list  below  names  the  members  of the Steering Council and Core Team responsible for creating the
       release of perl with which this document shipped.

       Remember, though that if you're reading the copy of this document that was installed with perl, it's very
       likely out of date.  Because every new stable feature release triggers an  election,  you're  better  off
       looking       at       the       most      up      to      date      copy      of      this      document
       &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/blob/blead/pod/perlgov.pod&gt;, in the <u>blead</u> branch of Perl's git repository.
       Because it's git, you can also see how the membership has changed over time.
