       <b>pmlogger_daily</b> - administration of Performance Co-Pilot archive files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmlogger_daily</b>  [<b>-DEfKMNoprRVzZ?</b>]  [<b>-c</b> <u>control</u>] [<b>-k</b> <u>time</u>] [<b>-l</b> <u>logfile</u>] [<b>-m</b> <u>addresses</u>] [<b>-s</b>
       <u>size</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>want</u>] [<b>-x</b> <u>time</u>] [<b>-X</b> <u>program</u>] [<b>-Y</b> <u>regex</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pmlogger_daily</b> and  the  related  <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check</a></b>(1)  tools  along  with  associated  control  files  (see
       <b><a href="../man5/pmlogger.control.5.html">pmlogger.control</a></b>(5))  may  be  used  to  create  a customized regime of administration and management for
       historical archives of performance data within the Performance Co-Pilot (see <b><a href="../man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro</a></b>(1)) infrastructure.

       <b>pmlogger_daily</b> is intended to be run once per day,  preferably  in  the  early  morning,  as  soon  after
       midnight  as  practicable.  Its task is to aggregate, rotate and perform general housekeeping one or more
       sets of PCP archives.

       To accommodate the evolution of PMDAs and changes in production logging environments,  <b>pmlogger_daily</b>  is
       integrated with <b><a href="../man1/pmlogrewrite.1.html">pmlogrewrite</a></b>(1) to allow optional and automatic rewriting of archives before merging.  If
       there are global rewriting rules to be applied across all archives mentioned in the control file(s), then
       create  the directory <u>$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmlogrewrite</u> and place any <b><a href="../man1/pmlogrewrite.1.html">pmlogrewrite</a></b>(1) rewriting rules in this
       directory.  For rewriting rules that are specific to only one family of archives, use the directory  name
       from  the control file(s) - i.e. the <u>fourth</u> field - and create a file, or a directory, or a symbolic link
       named <u>pmlogrewrite</u> within this directory and place the required rewriting  rule(s)  in  the  <u>pmlogrewrite</u>
       file  or  in files within the <u>pmlogrewrite</u> subdirectory.  <b>pmlogger_daily</b> will choose rewriting rules from
       the archive directory if they exist, else rewriting  rules  from  <u>$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmlogrewrite</u>  if  that
       directory exists, else no rewriting is attempted.

       As  an  alternate  mechanism,  if  the file <u>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/.NeedRewrite</u> exists when <b>pmlogger_daily</b>
       starts   then   this   is   treated   the   same   as   specifying   <b>-R</b>   on   the   command   line   and
       <u>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/.NeedRewrite</u> will be removed once all the rewriting has been done.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c</b> <u>control</u>, <b>--control</b>=<u>control</u>
            Both  <b>pmlogger_daily</b>  and  <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check</a></b>(1)  are  controlled  by  PCP  logger  control file(s) that
            specifies   the   <b>pmlogger</b>   instances   to   be   managed.    The   default   <u>control</u>    file    is
            <u>$PCP_PMLOGGERCONTROL_PATH</u>,  but an alternate may be specified using the <b>-c</b> option.  If the directory
            <u>$PCP_PMLOGGERCONTROL_PATH</u><b>.d</b> (or <u>control</u><b>.d</b> from the <b>-c</b> option)  exists,  then  the  contents  of  any
            additional <u>control</u> files therein will be appended to the main control file (which must exist).

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--noreport</b>
            Do not perform the conditional <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger_daily_report.1.html">pmlogger_daily_report</a></b>(1) processing as described below.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--expunge</b>
            This  option  causes  <b>pmlogger_daily</b>  to  pass  the <b>-E</b> flag to <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger_merge.1.html">pmlogger_merge</a></b>(1) in order to expunge
            metrics with metadata inconsistencies and continue rather than fail.  This is intended for automated
            daily archive rotation where it is highly desirable for unattended daily archive merging,  rewriting
            and  compression  to succeed.  For further details, see <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger_merge.1.html">pmlogger_merge</a></b>(1) and description for the <b>-x</b>
            flag in <b><a href="../man1/pmlogextract.1.html">pmlogextract</a></b>(1).

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--force</b>
            This option forces <b>pmlogger_daily</b> to attempt compression actions.  Using this option  in  production
            is not recommended.

       <b>-k</b> <u>time</u>, <b>--discard</b>=<u>time</u>
            After  some  period,  old PCP archives are discarded.  <u>time</u> is a time specification in the syntax of
            <b><a href="../man1/find-filter.1.html">find-filter</a></b>(1), so <u>DD</u>[<b>:</b><u>HH</u>[<b>:</b><u>MM</u>]].  The optional <u>HH</u> (hours) and  <u>MM</u>  (minutes)  parts  are  0  if  not
            specified.  By default the <u>time</u> is <b>14:0:0</b> or 14 days, but may be changed using this option.

            Some  special  values  are recognized for the <u>time</u>, namely <b>0</b> to keep no archives beyond the the ones
            being currently written by  <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger</a></b>(1),  and  <b>forever</b>  or  <b>never</b>  to  prevent  any  archives  being
            discarded.

            The  <u>time</u>  can  also be set using the <b>$PCP_CULLAFTER</b> variable, set in either the environment or in a
            control file.  If both <b>$PCP_CULLAFTER</b> and <b>-k</b> specify different values for <u>time</u> then the  environment
            variable  value  is used and a warning is issued, i.e. if <b>$PCP_CULLAFTER</b> is set in the <u>control</u> file,
            it overrides <b>-k</b> given on the command line.

            Note that the semantics of <u>time</u> are that it is measured from the time of last modification  of  each
            archive,  and  not  from  the  original  archive  creation  date.   This has subtle implications for
            compression (see below) - the compression process results in the creation of new archive files which
            have new modification times.  In this case, the <u>time</u> period (re)starts from the time of compression.

       <b>-K</b>   When this option is specified for <b>pmlogger_daily</b> then only the compression tasks are  attempted,  so
            no <b>pmlogger</b> rotation, no culling, no rewriting, etc.  When <b>-K</b> is used and a <u>period</u> of <b>0</b> is in effect
            (from  <b>-x</b> on the command line or <b>$PCP_COMPRESSAFTER</b> in the environment or via the <u>control</u> file) this
            is intended for environments where compression of archives is desired  before  the  scheduled  daily
            processing  happens.   To  achieve this, once <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check</a></b>(1) has completed regular processing, it
            calls <b>pmlogger_daily</b> with just the <b>-K</b> option.  Provided <b>$PCP_COMPRESSAFTER</b> is set to  <b>0</b>  along  with
            any  other  required  compression  options to match the scheduled invocation of <b>pmlogger_daily</b>, then
            this will compress all  volumes  except  the  ones  being  currently  written  by  <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger</a></b>(1).   If
            <b>$PCP_COMPRESSAFTER</b>  is  set  to a value greater than zero, then manually running <b>pmlogger_daily</b> <b>with</b>
            <b>the</b> <b>-x</b> option may be used to compress volumes that are younger  than  the  <b>$PCP_COMPRESSAFTER</b>  time.
            This  may  be  used  to reclaim filesystem space by compressing volumes earlier than they would have
            otherwise been compressed.  Note that since the default value of <b>$PCP_COMPRESSAFTER</b> is 0  days,  the
            <b>-x</b>  option has no effect unless the <b>control</b> file has been edited and <b>$PCP_COMPRESSAFTER</b> has been set
            to a value greater than <b>0</b>.

       <b>-l</b> <u>file</u>, <b>--logfile</b>=<u>file</u>
            In order to ensure that mail is not unintentionally sent when these scripts are run from <b><a href="../man8/cron.8.html">cron</a></b>(8)  or
            <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1)   diagnostics   are   always   sent   to   log   files.    By   default,   this  file  is
            <u>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/pmlogger_daily.log</u> but this can be changed using the <b>-l</b> option.  If  this  log
            <u>file</u>  already exists when the script starts, it will be renamed with a <u>.prev</u> suffix (overwriting any
            log file saved earlier) before diagnostics are generated to the log file.  The  <b>-l</b>  and  <b>-t</b>  options
            cannot be used together.

       <b>-m</b> <u>addresses</u>, <b>--mail</b>=<u>addresses</u>
            Use  of  this  option  causes  <b>pmlogger_daily</b> to construct a summary of the ``notices'' file entries
            which were generated in the last 24 hours, and e-mail that summary to  the  set  of  space-separated
            <u>addresses</u>.  This daily summary is stored in the file <u>$PCP_LOG_DIR/NOTICES.daily</u>, which will be empty
            when no new ``notices'' entries were made in the previous 24 hour period.

       <b>-M</b>   This  option  may  be  used  to disable archive merging (or renaming) and rewriting (<b>-M</b> implies <b>-r</b>).
            This is most useful in cases  where  the  archives  are  being  incrementally  copied  to  a  remote
            repository,  e.g.  using  <b><a href="../man1/rsync.1.html">rsync</a></b>(1).   Merging,  renaming  and  rewriting all risk an increase in the
            synchronization load, especially immediately after <b>pmlogger_daily</b> has run, so <b>-M</b> may  be  useful  in
            these cases.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--showme</b>
            This  option enables a ``show me'' mode, where the programs actions are echoed, but not executed, in
            the style of ``make -n''.  Using <b>-N</b> in conjunction with <b>-V</b> maximizes the diagnostic capabilities for
            debugging.

       <b>-o</b>   By default all possible archives will be merged.  This option reinstates the old behaviour in  which
            only  yesterday's archives will be considered as merge candidates.  In the special case where only a
            single input archive needs to be merged,  <b><a href="../man1/pmlogmv.1.html">pmlogmv</a></b>(1)  is  used  to  rename  the  archive,  otherwise
            <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger_merge.1.html">pmlogger_merge</a></b>(1) is used to merge all of the archives for a single host and a single day into a new
            PCP archive and the individual archives are removed.

       <b>-p</b>   If this option is specified for <b>pmlogger_daily</b> then the status of the daily processing is polled and
            if  the  daily <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger</a></b>(1) rotation, culling, rewriting, compressing, etc.  has not been done in the
            last 24 hours then it is done now.  The intent is to have <b>pmlogger_daily</b> called regularly  with  the
            <b>-p</b>  option  (at  30  mins  past  the hour, every hour in the default <b><a href="../man8/cron.8.html">cron</a></b>(8) set up) to ensure daily
            processing happens as soon as possible if it was missed at the regularly scheduled  time  (which  is
            00:10  by  default),  e.g.  if  the  system  was  down  or suspended at that time.  With this option
            <b>pmlogger_daily</b> simply exits if the previous day's processing has already been done.  Note that  this
            option  is not used on platforms supporting <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1) because the <b>pmlogger_daily.timer</b> service unit
            specifies a timer setting with <b>Persistent=true</b>.   The  <b>-K</b>  and  <b>-p</b>  options  to  <b>pmlogger_daily</b>  are
            mutually exclusive.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--norewrite</b>
            This command line option acts as an override and prevents all archive rewriting with <b><a href="../man1/pmlogrewrite.1.html">pmlogrewrite</a></b>(1)
            independent of the presence of any rewriting rule files or directories.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--rewriteall</b>
            Sometimes  PMDA  changes  require  <u>all</u>  archives  to be rewritten, not just the ones involved in any
            current merging.  This is required for example after a  PCP  upgrade  where  a  new  version  of  an
            existing  PMDA  has revised metadata.  The <b>-R</b> command line forces this universal-style of rewriting.
            The <b>-R</b> option to <b>pmlogger_daily</b> is mutually exclusive with both the <b>-r</b> and <b>-M</b> options.

       <b>-s</b> <u>size</u>, <b>--rotate</b>=<u>size</u>
            If the PCP ``notices'' file (<u>$PCP_LOG_DIR/NOTICES</u>) is larger than 20480 bytes,  <b>pmlogger_daily</b>  will
            rename  the file with a ``.old'' suffix, and start a new ``notices'' file.  The rotate threshold may
            be changed from 20480 to <u>size</u> bytes using the <b>-s</b> option.

       <b>-t</b> <u>period</u>
            To assist with debugging or diagnosing intermittent failures the <b>-t</b> option may be used.   This  will
            turn   on   very   verbose   tracing   (<b>-VV</b>)   and   capture  the  trace  output  in  a  file  named
            <u>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/daily.datestamp.trace</u>, where <u>datestamp</u> is the time <b>pmlogger_daily</b> was  run  in
            the  format  YYYYMMDD.HH.MM.   In addition, the <u>period</u> argument will ensure that trace files created
            with <b>-t</b> will be kept for <u>period</u> days and then discarded.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
            The output from the <b>cron</b> execution of the scripts may be extended using the <b>-V</b> option to the scripts
            which will enable verbose tracing of their activity.  By default  the  scripts  generate  no  output
            unless  some error or warning condition is encountered.  A second <b>-V</b> increases the verbosity.  Using
            <b>-N</b> in conjunction with <b>-V</b> maximizes the diagnostic capabilities for debugging.

       <b>-x</b> <u>time</u>, <b>--compress-after</b>=<u>time</u>
            Archive data files can optionally be compressed after some period to conserve disk space.   This  is
            particularly useful for large numbers of <b>pmlogger</b> processes under the control of <b>pmlogger_daily</b>.

            <u>time</u>  is  a  time  specification  in the syntax of <b><a href="../man1/find-filter.1.html">find-filter</a></b>(1), so <u>DD</u>[<b>:</b><u>HH</u>[<b>:</b><u>MM</u>]].  The optional <u>HH</u>
            (hours) and <u>MM</u> (minutes) parts are 0 if not specified.

            Some special values are recognized for the <u>time</u>, namely <b>0</b> to apply compression as soon as  possible,
            and <b>forever</b> or <b>never</b> to prevent any compression being done.

            If  <b>transparent_decompress</b>  is enabled when <u>libpcp</u> was built (can be checked with the <b><a href="../man1/pmconfig.1.html">pmconfig</a></b>(1) <b>-L</b>
            option), then the default behaviour is compression ``as soon as possible''.  Otherwise  the  default
            behaviour  is  to  <b>not</b> compress files (which matches the historical default behaviour in earlier PCP
            releases).

            The <u>time</u> can also be set using the <b>$PCP_COMPRESSAFTER</b> variable, set in either the environment or  in
            a  <u>control</u>  file.   If  both  <b>$PCP_COMPRESSAFTER</b>  and  <b>-x</b> specify different values for <u>time</u> then the
            environment variable value is used and a warning is issued.   For  important  other  detailed  notes
            concerning volume compression, see the <b>-K</b> and <b>-k</b> options (above).

       <b>-X</b> <u>program</u>, <b>--compressor</b>=<u>program</u>
            This  option  specifies  the  program  to  use  for  compression  -  by  default this is <b><a href="../man1/xz.1.html">xz</a></b>(1).  The
            environment variable <b>$PCP_COMPRESS</b> may be used as an alternative mechanism to  define  <u>program</u>.   If
            both <b>$PCP_COMPRESS</b> and <b>-X</b> specify different compression programs then the environment variable value
            is used and a warning is issued.

       <b>-Y</b> <u>regex</u>, <b>--regex</b>=<u>regex</u>
            This  option  allows  a regular expression to be specified causing files in the set of files matched
            for compression to be omitted - this allows only the data file to be compressed, and  also  prevents
            the program from attempting to compress it more than once.  The default <u>regex</u> is
            "\.(index|Z|gz|bz2|zip|xz|lzma|lzo|lz4|zst)$"
            -   such   files   are  filtered  using  the  <b>-v</b>  option  to  <b><a href="../man1/egrep.1.html">egrep</a></b>(1).   The  environment  variable
            <b>$PCP_COMPRESSREGEX</b>  may  be  used  as  an  alternative  mechanism  to   define   <u>regex</u>.    If   both
            <b>$PCP_COMPRESSREGEX</b>  and <b>-Y</b> specify different values for <u>regex</u> then the environment variable value is
            used and a warning is issued.

       <b>-z</b>   This option causes <b>pmlogger_daily</b> to <b>not</b> ``re-exec'',  see  <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger</a></b>(1),  when  it  would  otherwise
            choose to do so and is intended only for QA testing.

       <b>-Z</b>   This  option causes <b>pmlogger_daily</b> to ``re-exec'', see <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger</a></b>(1), whenever that is possible and is
            intended only for QA testing.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
            Display usage message and exit.

</pre><h4><b>CALLBACKS</b></h4><pre>
       Additionally <b>pmlogger_daily</b> supports  the  following  ``hooks''  to  allow  auxiliary  operations  to  be
       performed  at  key  points  in  the daily processing of the archives.  These callbacks are controlled via
       variables that may be set in the environment or via the <u>control</u> file.

       Note that merge callbacks and autosaving described below are <b>not</b> enabled when only compression tasks  are
       being attempted, i.e. when <b>-K</b> command line option is used.

       All  of the callback script execution and the autosave file moving will be executed as the non-privileged
       user ``pcp'' and group ``pcp'', so appropriate permissions may need to have been set up in advance.

       <b>$PCP_MERGE_CALLBACK</b>
            As  each  day's  archive  is  created  by  merging  and  before  any  compression  takes  place,  if
            <b>$PCP_MERGE_CALLBACK</b>  is  defined,  then  it  is  assumed to be a script that will be called with one
            argument being the name of the archive  (stripped  of  any  suffixes),  so  something  of  the  form
            <u>/some/directory/path/YYYYMMDD</u>.   The  script  needs  to be either a full pathname, or something that
            will be found on the shell's <b>$PATH</b> <b>.</b>  The  callback  script  will  be  run  in  the  foreground,  so
            <b>pmlogger_daily</b> will wait for it to complete.

            If  the control file contains more than one <b>$PCP_MERGE_CALLBACK</b> specification then these will be run
            serially in the order they appear in the control file.  If <b>$PCP_MERGE_CALLBACK</b>  is  defined  in  the
            environment  when  <b>pmlogger_daily</b> is run, this is treated as though this option was the first in the
            control file, i.e. it will be run before any merge callbacks mentioned in the control file.

            If the <u>pcp-zeroconf</u> packages  is  installed,  then  a  special  merge  callback  is  added  to  call
            <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger_daily_report.1.html">pmlogger_daily_report</a></b>(1)   first,   before   any   other   merge   callback   options.    Refer   to
            <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger_daily_report.1.html">pmlogger_daily_report</a></b>(1) for an explanation of the <u>pcp-zeroconf</u> requirements.

            If <b>pmlogger_daily</b> is in ``catch up'' mode (more  than  one  day's  worth  of  archives  need  to  be
            combined) then each call back is executed once for each day's archive that is generated.

            A  typical  use might be to produce daily reports from the PCP archive which needs to wait until the
            archive has been created, but is more efficient if it is done before any  potential  compression  of
            the archive.

       <b>$PCP_COMPRESS_CALLBACK</b>
            If  <b>pmlogger_daily</b>  is  run  with <b>-x</b> <b>0</b> or <b>$PCP_COMPRESSAFTER=0</b>, then compression is done immediately
            after merging.  As each day's archive is compressed, if <b>$PCP_COMPRESS_CALLBACK</b> is defined,  then  it
            is  assumed  to  be  a  script  that  will be called with one argument being the name of the archive
            (stripped of any suffixes), so something of  the  form  <u>/some/directory/path/YYYYMMDD</u>.   The  script
            needs  to  be  either  a  full pathname, or something that will be found on the shell's <b>$PATH</b> <b>.</b>  The
            callback script will be run in the foreground, so <b>pmlogger_daily</b> will wait for it to complete.

            If the control file contains more than one <b>$PCP_COMPRESS_CALLBACK</b> specification then these  will  be
            run  serially in the order they appear in the control file.  If <b>$PCP_COMPRESS_CALLBACK</b> is defined in
            the environment when <b>pmlogger_daily</b> is run, this is treated as though this option was the  first  in
            the control file, i.e. it will be run first.

            If  <b>pmlogger_daily</b>  is  in  ``catch  up''  mode  (more  than  one day's worth of archives need to be
            compressed) then each call back is executed once for each day's archive that is compressed.

            A typical use might be to keep recent archives in uncompressed form for efficient querying, but move
            the older archives to some other storage location once the compression has been done.

       <b>$PCP_AUTOSAVE_DIR</b>
            Once the merging and possible compression has been done by <b>pmlogger_daily</b>, if  <b>$PCP_AUTOSAVE_DIR</b>  is
            defined  then  all of the physical files that make up one day's archive will be moved (autosaved) to
            the directory specified by <b>$PCP_AUTOSAVE_DIR.</b>

            The basename of the archive is used to set the reserved words <b>DATEYYYY</b> (year),  <b>DATEMM</b>  (month)  and
            <b>DATEDD</b>  (day)  and  these  (along with <b>LOCALHOSTNAME</b>) may appear literally in <b>$PCP_AUTOSAVE_DIR</b>, and
            will be substituted at execution time to generate the destination directory name.  For example:
                  $PCP_AUTOSAVE_DIR=/gpfs/LOCALHOSTNAME/DATEYYYY/DATEMM-DATEDD

            Note that these ``date'' reserved words correspond to  the  date  on  which  the  archive  data  was
            collected, not the date that <b>pmlogger_daily</b> was run.

            If   <b>$PCP_AUTOSAVE_DIR</b>   (after  <b>LOCALHOSTNAME</b>  and  ``date''  substitution)  does  not  exist  then
            <b>pmlogger_daily</b> will attempt to create it (along with any parent  directories  that  do  not  exist).
            Just  be  aware  that this directory creation runs under the uid of the user ``pcp'', so directories
            along the path to <b>$PCP_AUTOSAVE_DIR</b> may need to be writeable by this non-root user.

            By ``move'' the archives we mean a paranoid checksum-copy-checksum-remove (using the <b>-c</b>  option  for
            <b><a href="../man1/pmlogmv.1.html">pmlogmv</a></b>(1))  that  will  bail  if  the  copy  fails  or the checksums do not match (the archives are
            important so we cannot risk something like a full filesystem or a permissions issue messing with the
            copy process).

            If <b>pmlogger_daily</b> is in ``catch up'' mode (more  than  one  day's  worth  of  archives  need  to  be
            combined) then the archives for more than one day could be copied in this step.

            A  typical  use  might  be to create PCP archives on a local filesystem initially, then once all the
            data for a single day has been collected  and  merged,  migrate  that  day's  archive  to  a  shared
            filesystem  or  a  remote  filesystem.   This  may allow automatic backup to off-site storage and/or
            reduce the number of I/O operations and filesystem metadata operations on the  (potentially  slower)
            non-local filesystem.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Refer  to  <b><a href="../man5/pmlogger.control.5.html">pmlogger.control</a></b>(5)  for  a  description  of the contol file(s) that are used to control which
       <b>pmlogger</b> instances and which archives are managed by <b>pmlogger_check</b> and <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily</a></b>(1).

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger/config.default</u>
            default <b>pmlogger</b> configuration file location for  the  local  primary  logger,  typically  generated
            automatically by <b><a href="../man1/pmlogconf.1.html">pmlogconf</a></b>(1).

       <u>$PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/&lt;hostname&gt;</u>
            default location for archives of performance information collected from the host <u>hostname</u>

       <u>$PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/&lt;hostname&gt;/lock</u>
            transient  lock  file  to  guarantee  mutual  exclusion  during <b>pmlogger</b> administration for the host
            <u>hostname</u> - if present, can be safely removed if neither  <b>pmlogger_daily</b>  nor  <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check</a></b>(1)  are
            running

       <u>$PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/&lt;hostname&gt;/Latest</u>
            PCP  archive  folio created by <b><a href="../man1/mkaf.1.html">mkaf</a></b>(1) for the most recently launched archive containing performance
            metrics from the host <u>hostname</u>

       <u>$PCP_LOG_DIR/NOTICES</u>
            PCP ``notices'' file used by <b><a href="../man1/pmie.1.html">pmie</a></b>(1) and friends

       <u>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/pmlogger_daily.log</u>
            if the previous execution of <b>pmlogger_daily</b> produced any output it is saved here.  The  normal  case
            is no output in which case the file does not exist.

       <u>$PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/SaveLogs</u>
             if  this  directory exists, then the log file from the <b>-l</b> argument for <b>pmlogger_daily</b> will be saved
             in  this   directory   with   the   name   of   the   format   &lt;date&gt;-<b>pmlogger_daily</b>.<b>log</b>.&lt;pid&gt;   or
             &lt;date&gt;-<b>pmlogger_daily-K</b>.<b>log</b>.&lt;pid&gt; This allows the log file to be inspected at a later time, even if
             several  <b>pmlogger_daily</b>  executions  have  been  launched  in the interim.  Because the PCP archive
             management tools run under the $PCP_USER account ``pcp'', <u>$PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/SaveLogs</u> typically needs
             to be owned by the user ``pcp''.

       <u>$PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/&lt;hostname&gt;/SaveLogs</u>
              if this directory exists, then the log file from the <b>-l</b> argument of a newly  launched  <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger</a></b>(1)
              for  <u>hostname</u>  will  be  saved  in  this  directory with the name <u>archive</u><b>.log</b> where <u>archive</u> is the
              basename of the associated <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger</a></b>(1) PCP  archive  files.   This  allows  the  log  file  to  be
              inspected  at  a later time, even if several <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger</a></b>(1) instances for <u>hostname</u> have been launched
              in the interim.  Because the PCP archive management tools run under the uid of the  user  ``pcp'',
              <u>$PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/&lt;hostname&gt;/SaveLogs</u> typically needs to be owned by the user ``pcp''.

       <u>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/.NeedRewrite</u>
               if  this  file exists, then this is treated as equivalent to using <b>-R</b> on the command line and the
               file will be removed once all rewriting has been done.

</pre><h4><b>PCP</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_</b> are used to parameterize the file and directory names used  by
       PCP.   On  each  installation, the file <u>/etc/pcp.conf</u> contains the local values for these variables.  The
       <b>$PCP_CONF</b> variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration file, as described in <b><a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf</a></b>(5).

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       Earlier versions of <b>pmlogger_daily</b> used <b><a href="../man1/find.1.html">find</a></b>(1) to locate files for compressing or culling and the <b>-k</b> and
       <b>-x</b> options took only integer values to mean ``days''.  The semantics of this was quite loose  given  that
       <b><a href="../man1/find.1.html">find</a></b>(1) offers different precision and semantics across platforms.

       The  current implementation of <b>pmlogger_daily</b> uses <b><a href="../man1/find-filter.1.html">find-filter</a></b>(1) which provides high precision intervals
       and semantics that are relative to the time of execution and are consistent across platforms.
