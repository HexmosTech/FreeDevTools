       <b>pmdashping</b> - "shell-ping" performance metrics domain agent

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/shping/pmdashping</b>  [<b>-C</b>]  [<b>-d</b> <u>domain</u>] [<b>-l</b> <u>logfile</u>] [<b>-I</b> <u>interval</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>timeout</u>] [<b>-U</b> <u>username</u>]
       <u>configfile</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pmdashping</b> is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which exports quality  of  service  and  response
       time measurements for arbitrary commands as might be run from a shell such as <b><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></b>(1).

       These measurements are intended to be used to quantify service quality and service availability for those
       services that are either mission critical or act as early indicators of adverse system performance.

       The  sample  configuration  monitors  simple  shell  commands (<b>exit</b> and <b><a href="../man1/date.1.html">date</a></b>(1)), a short computationally
       intensive task using <b><a href="../man1/sum.1.html">sum</a></b>(1), a short C compilation, DNS lookup via <b><a href="../man1/nslookup.1.html">nslookup</a></b>(1), YP lookup  via  <b><a href="../man1/ypcat.1.html">ypcat</a></b>(1),
       bind/portmapper  service  using  <b><a href="../man1/rpcbind.1.html">rpcbind</a></b>(1),  SMTP  by connecting to telnet port 25 and sending an ``expn
       root'' request, and NNTP by connecting to telnet port 119 and running a ``listgroup'' command.

       It is expected that other commands would follow the examples in the sample configuration file,  and  most
       deployments of the <b>pmdashping</b> PMDA are expected to use a customized configuration file.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdashping</b> command line options follows:

       <b>-C</b>   Parse  <u>configfile</u>,  reporting  any  errors  and  exiting  with  non-zero status if the file contains
            syntactical errors.

       <b>-d</b>   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <u>domain</u> number specified  here  is  unique  and
            consistent.  That is, <u>domain</u> should be different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same <u>domain</u>
            number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.

       <b>-l</b>   Location  of  the  log  file.   By  default,  a  log file named <u>shping.log</u> is written in the current
            directory of <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1) when <b>pmdashping</b> is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If the log file cannot be
            created or is not writable, output is written to the standard error instead.

       <b>-I</b>   Amount of time (in seconds) between subsequent executions of the list of commands provided  via  the
            configuration file <u>configfile</u>.  The default is 2 minutes.

       <b>-t</b>   Amount  of  time  (in  seconds)  to  wait  before  timing out awaiting a response for a command from
            <u>configfile</u>.  The default is 20 seconds.

       <b>-U</b>   User account under which to run the agent and all commands.  The default is the  unprivileged  "pcp"
            account in current versions of PCP, but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was used by
            default.

       The  required  <u>configfile</u>  specifies  ``tag'' and ``command'' pairs, each on a separate line.  All of the
       commands are run one after another, with the whole group rescheduled to be run once  per  <u>interval</u>.   For
       each  command  that  is  run,  <b>pmdashping</b>  records  information related to the success (or timeout), exit
       status, elapsed time and CPU time (system and user), and this information is exported by the  PMDA.   The
       tags  are  used to identify the individual commands amongst the values exported by the PMDA, and form the
       external instance domain identifiers for the <b>pmdashping</b> metrics which relate to each command.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       In order for a host to export the names, help text and values for the shping performance metrics, do  the
       following as root:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/shping
            # ./Install

       The  set  of ``tag'' and ``command'' pairs may be specified from a default (sample) configuration file, a
       customized file or entered interactively as part of the <b>Install</b> script.

       If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/shping
            # ./Remove

       <b>pmdashping</b> is launched by <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1) and should never be executed directly.  The Install and Remove  scripts
       notify <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1) when the agent is installed or removed.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>$PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH</b>
                 command line options used to launch <b>pmdashping</b>
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/shping/help</b>
                 default help text file for the shping metrics
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/shping/sample.conf</b>
                 example configuration file with a number of common commands
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/shping/Install</b>
                 installation script for the <b>pmdashping</b> agent
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/shping/Remove</b>
                 undo installation script for <b>pmdashping</b>
       <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/shping.log</b>
                 default log file for error messages and other information from <b>pmdashping</b>

</pre><h4><b>PCP</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Environment  variables with the prefix <b>PCP_</b> are used to parameterize the file and directory names used by
       PCP.  On each installation, the file <b>/etc/pcp.conf</b> contains the local values for  these  variables.   The
       <b>$PCP_CONF</b> variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration file, as described in <b><a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf</a></b>(5).
