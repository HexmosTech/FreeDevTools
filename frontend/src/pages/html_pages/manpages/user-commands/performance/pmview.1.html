</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pmview</b> is a generalized 3D performance metrics visualization tool for the Performance Co-Pilot (<b><a href="../man1/PCP.1.html">PCP</a></b>(1)).

       <b>pmview</b>  is  the  base  utility behind performance metrics visualization tools such as <b><a href="../man1/dkvis.1.html">dkvis</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/mpvis.1.html">mpvis</a></b>(1),
       <b><a href="../man1/osvis.1.html">osvis</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/nfsvis.1.html">nfsvis</a></b>(1), It is also used by a range  of  related  tools  that  are  specific  to  optional
       Performance  Domain  Agents  (PMDA)  and/or  PCP  add-on  products.  <b>pmview</b> may also be used to construct
       customized 3D performance displays.

       <b>pmview</b> displays performance metrics as colored blocks and cylinders arranged on monochrome  base  planes.
       Each  object may represent a single performance metric, or a stack of several performance metrics.  Since
       the objects are modulated by the value of the metric  they  represent,  only  numerical  metrics  may  be
       visualized.   Objects  representing a single metric may be modulated in terms of height, color, or height
       and color.  Objects in a stack may only be height modulated, but the  stack  can  be  normalized  to  the
       maximum height.  Labels may be added to the scene to help identify groups of metrics.

       A  configuration file (as specified by the <b>-c</b> option, or read from standard input) is used to specify the
       position, color, maximum value and labels of metrics and metric instances  in  the  scene.   The  maximum
       value acts as a normalization factor and is used to scale the object height and/or color in proportion to
       the  metric values.  Metric values which exceed the associated maximum value are displayed as solid white
       objects.  If a metric is unavailable, the object will have minimum height and will be colored grey.

       The full syntax of the scene description language is provided in <b><a href="../man5/pmview.5.html">pmview</a></b>(5).

       Normally, the tool operates in ``live'' mode where performance metrics are  fetched  in  real-time.   The
       user  can  view  metrics  from  any host running <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1).  <b>pmview</b> can also replay archives of performance
       metrics (see <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger</a></b>(1)) and allow the user to interactively control the current replay  time  and  rate
       using  the  VCR  paradigm.   This is particularly useful for retrospective comparisons and for postmortem
       analysis of performance problems where a remote system is not accessible or a performance analyst is  not
       available on-site.

       All  metrics in the Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS) with numeric value semantics from any number of
       hosts or archives may be visualized.  <b>pmview</b> examines the semantics of the metrics  and  where  sensible,
       converts metric values to a rate before scaling.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>-S</b>, <b>-T</b>, <b>-O</b> and <b>-A</b> options may be used to define a time window to restrict the samples retrieved, set
       an initial origin within the time window, or specify a ``natural'' alignment of the sample  times;  refer
       to <b><a href="../man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro</a>(1)</b> for a complete description of these options.

       The other available options are:

       <b>-a</b> <u>archive</u>[<b>,</b><u>archive</u><b>,</b>...]]
              Specify  an  <u>archive</u>  from  which  metrics  can be obtained for a particular host.  <u>archive</u> is the
              basename of an archive, or the name of a directory  containing  archives,  previously  created  by
              <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger</a></b>(1).   Multiple  sets  of  archives  (separated by commas or in different <b>-a</b> options) from
              different hosts may be given, but an error will occur if there is more than one  set  of  archives
              from  the  same  host.  Any metrics that are not associated with a specific host or archive in the
              configuration file will use the first set of archives as their source.

       <b>-C</b>     Parse the configuration file and exit before displaying the <b>pmview</b>  window.   Any  errors  in  the
              configuration file are displayed.

       <b>-c</b> <u>configfile</u>
              Load the configuration from <u>configfile</u> rather than standard input.

       <b>-h</b> <u>host</u>
              Fetch  performance  metrics from <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1) on <u>host</u>, rather than the default localhost.  Implies that
              <b>pmview</b> will run in live mode, so no archives can be specified  on  the  command  line  or  in  the
              configuration file.  Only one <b>-h</b> option may be given.

       <b>-n</b> <u>pmnsfile</u>
              Normally  <b>pmview</b> operates on the distributed Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS), however if the
              <b>-n</b> option is specified an alternative local PMNS is loaded from the file <u>pmnsfile</u>.

       <b>-p</b> <u>port</u>
              Connect to the time controls (see <b><a href="../man1/pmtime.1.html">pmtime</a></b>(1)) on this <b>port</b>.  Used when a tool launches another tool
              so that they can connect to the same time controls.

       <b>-R</b> <u>logconfig</u>
              Use <u>logconfig</u> as the <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger</a></b>(1) config when recording.

       <b>-r</b> <u>addconfig</u>
              Append <u>addconfig</u> onto the <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger</a></b>(1) config generated by <b>pmview</b> when recording.

       <b>-t</b> <u>interval</u>
              The update <u>interval</u> used to fetch metrics from the live or archive sources.  The <u>interval</u> argument
              follows the syntax described in <b><a href="../man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro</a></b>(1), and in the simplest form may be an  unsigned  integer
              (the implied units in this case are seconds).  The default is 2.0 seconds.

       <b>-x</b> <u>version</u>
              Use  the specified <u>version</u> of the <b><a href="../man5/pmlaunch.5.html">pmlaunch</a></b>(5) specification.  The versions currently supported are
              ``1.0'' and the default version ``2.0''.

       <b>-Z</b> <u>timezone</u>
              By default, <b>pmview</b> reports the time of day according to the local timezone  on  the  system  where
              <b>pmview</b>  is  run.   The  <b>-Z</b>  option changes the default timezone to <u>timezone</u> which should be in the
              format of the environment variable <b>TZ</b> as described in <b><a href="../man7/environ.7.html">environ</a></b>(7).

       <b>-z</b>     Change the reporting timezone to the local timezone  at  the  host  that  is  the  source  of  the
              performance metrics, as identified via either the <b>-h</b> option, or the first <b>-a</b> option.

       <b>-geometry</b> <u>geometry</u>
       <b>-display</b> <u>display</u>
       <b>-name</b> <u>name</u>
       <b>-title</b> <u>title</u>

</pre><h4><b>WINDOW</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>pmview</b>  window  is  comprised of a menu bar, time and scale controls, metric and time values, and an
       ``examiner'' viewer.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMINER</b> <b>VIEWER</b></h4><pre>
       The left, right and bottom edges of the examiner viewer contain a variety of  thumb  wheels  and  buttons
       that  can  be used to adjust the visualization of the 3D scene.  The <u>Rotx</u> and <u>Roty</u> thumb wheels allow the
       user to rotate the scene about the x and y axes, respectively.  The <u>dolly</u> thumb wheel moves  the  virtual
       camera  closer  and  further from the scene allowing the user to examine specific parts in detail or view
       the entire scene.  On the right edge of the viewer are eight buttons which affect the way  the  user  can
       interact with the scene.

       <u>Pointer</u>
           Changes  the  cursor  to  a  pointer which allows blocks to be selected in the scene.  See the Metric
           Selection section below.

       <u>Hand</u>
           Changes the cursor to a hand which allows the scene to be rotated, translated  and  dollied  using  a
           combination of mouse buttons.  The left mouse button can be used to rotate the scene in the direction
           of  the  mouse.   Releasing  the left mouse button before the mouse has stopped moving will cause the
           scene to continue to rotate, which can be stopped by pressing  the  left  mouse  button  again.   The
           middle  mouse  button  will  ``pan'' the scene, and both mouse buttons act as a dolly for the virtual
           camera.

       <u>Question</u> <u>Mark</u>
           Displays the SGI Help information for the examiner viewer.

       <u>Home</u>
           Changes the scene back to its original position, unless the home position has  been  changed  by  the
           home pointer button.

       <u>Home</u> <u>Pointer</u>
           Changes the home position of the scene to be the scene currently in view.

       <u>Eye</u> Resizes the scene so that it completely fits into the 3D viewing area.

       <u>Cross-hairs</u>
           Moves  the  object  under  the  cursor to the center of the viewing area, if the hand cursor has been
           selected.  Pressing the ``s'' key while the cursor is over an object has the same effect.

       <u>Perspective</u> <u>Box</u>
           Switches the display between perspective and orthogonal projections.

       Pressing the right mouse button within the scene window will bring up a menu of options which affect  how
       the  3D  scene  is  drawn.   The options include drawing the blocks as wire frames, and turning on stereo
       viewing.

</pre><h4><b>METRIC</b> <b>SELECTION</b></h4><pre>
       When the pointer cursor is active, more information about the 3D scene can be obtained.  Text  describing
       the  metric represented by the block under the cursor will be displayed in the top text box of the <b>pmview</b>
       window.  The text contains the source and name of the metric, current value and units, and the percentage
       of the expected maximum (or normalization) value.  The text box is updated whenever the scene is  updated
       with  the  latest  metric values or when the cursor is moved over another block in the scene.  Moving the
       cursor over a base plane block, text or the surrounding space will clear the text box.

       Clicking the left mouse button on a block will bind the text box on that  metric  instance  so  that  the
       metric  can  be  monitored  while performing other actions with the mouse.  The block will be highlighted
       with a red wire frame.  Clicking the left mouse button on text or the space surrounding  the  scene  will
       unselect  the  object,  causing  the  text  box  to revert to the original behavior of showing the metric
       underneath the cursor.

       Selecting a base plane instead of a modulated block will cause all the blocks on that base  plane  to  be
       selected.   When more than one object is selected, the text box behaves as if nothing is selected, so the
       metric displayed is the metric currently under the cursor.  Multiple  selections  are  also  possible  by
       pressing the SHIFT key while selecting an object with the left mouse button.

</pre><h4><b>MENUS</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  four  menus  in  <b>pmview</b>'s user interface which allow scenes to be recorded, saved and printed
       (<b>File</b>), access to the time controls (<b>Options</b>), launching other tools (<b>Launch</b>) and online help (<b>Help</b>).

       <b>File/Record</b>
           When in ``live'' mode, this option will launch <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger</a></b>(1) processes to record the current scene into
           an archive folio (see <b><a href="../man1/pmafm.1.html">pmafm</a>(1))</b> so that it may be replayed at a  later  time.   This  option  is  not
           available in ``replay'' mode.

           When  <b>File/Record</b>  is  selected,  a  file  chooser dialog will prompt for the name of the new archive
           folio.  If the directory to the folio does not exist, <b>pmview</b>  will  attempt  to  create  it.   It  is
           usually  convenient  to keep each folio within its own directory as there will be several other files
           associated with the folio, including the generated archives.

           Once a valid folio has been created, <b>pmview</b> will launch  a  <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger</a></b>(1)  process  for  each  host  to
           collect  the  metrics  required  from  that host in the current scene.  The current selections do not
           affect the set of metrics that are recorded.

           While recording is in progress, a red dot will appear in the time controls button in  the  top  left-
           hand  corner of the <b>pmview</b> window.  The <b>File/Record</b> option will also change to <b>File/Stop</b> <b>Recording</b> as
           only one recording session is possible at any one time.  Selecting blocks or  launching  other  tools
           will have no affect on the recording session.

           The record session may be terminated by selecting <b>File/Stop</b> <b>Recording</b>.  This will display dialogs for
           each  <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger</a></b>(1)  instance  describing the size and location of the archive files before terminating
           each process.  When all <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger</a></b>(1) processes have been terminated, the red dot is removed  from  the
           time  controls button, and the menu reverts back to <b>File/Record</b> to allow another recording session to
           take place.

           If the application exists while recording, a dialog  will  appear  allowing  you  to  terminate  each
           <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger</a></b>(1) process, or leave it running unattached.

           An  archive  folio  may be replayed using the command: ``<b>pmafm</b> <u>folio</u> <b>replay</b>''.  See <b><a href="../man1/pmafm.1.html">pmafm</a></b>(1) for more
           details.

           It is not uncommon for a front-end script which generates a <b>pmview</b> scene to use metrics that are  not
           contained  in  the  scene.  For example, <b><a href="../man1/osvis.1.html">osvis</a></b>(1) uses several <u>hinv</u> metrics to determine the size and
           layout of some objects.  As these metrics are also needed when replaying the generated  archive  with
           the  front-end  script, a complete <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger</a></b>(1) config can be specified (<b>-R</b>) that overrides the <b>pmview</b>
           generated config, or an additional config can be appended (<b>-r</b>) to the <b>pmview</b> generated config.

       <b>File/Save</b>
           Saves the current scene to a human-readable Open Inventor file (see <b><a href="../man1/inventor.1.html">inventor</a></b>(1)).  A file dialog will
           prompt for the location of the file.  The default file extension is ``.iv'' which  is  recognized  by
           <b><a href="../man1/ivview.1.html">ivview</a></b>(1) and some Web browsers.

       <b>File/Print</b>
           Outputs the current scene to a printer.  A print dialog will be displayed allowing a specific printer
           to be selected.

       <b>File/Quit</b>
           <b>pmview</b>  immediately  exits.   If recording was active, dialogs will be displayed for each <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger</a></b>(1)
           process so that they may be terminated.

       <b>Options/Show</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Control</b>
           Displays the time controls (see <b><a href="../man1/pmtime.1.html">pmtime</a></b>(1)) that are  driving  this  instance  of  <b>pmview</b>.   The  time
           controls  may  be  shared  by  other  tools,  including  <b><a href="../man1/pmchart.1.html">pmchart</a></b>(1), that have been launched by other
           instances of <b>pmview</b> and <b><a href="../man1/oview.1.html">oview</a></b>(1).  Therefore, this menu item may appear to have no affect if the time
           controls are already visible.

       <b>Options/New</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Control</b>
           Disconnect with the current time controls (which may be shared by other tools, see <b><a href="../man1/pmtime.1.html">pmtime</a></b>(1)) and use
           a new time control that is not  connected  to  any  other  tools.   The  new  time  control  will  be
           immediately displayed.

       <b>Launch</b>
           The  launch  menu  is  generated from a menu specification file (see <b><a href="../man5/pmlaunch.5.html">pmlaunch</a></b>(5)).  The menu contains
           tools that may be launched based on the sources and names of the selected metrics in the scene.   For
           example,  if  the selected metrics are from three different hosts, then three copies of a tool may be
           launched, one for each host.  The behavior of a launch depends on the selected metrics and the  tools
           being launched.

           On  selection  of  a  <b>Launch</b>  menu item <b>pmview</b> generates state information in the <b><a href="../man5/pmlaunch.5.html">pmlaunch</a></b>(5) metrics
           specification format.  This provides a description of the  selected  metrics  (or  if  there  are  no
           selections, all the metrics) in the scene without any geometry information.

           Tools which can monitor multiple hosts and user specified metrics may be launched only once for those
           metrics  (eg  <b><a href="../man1/pmdumptext.1.html">pmdumptext</a></b>(1)).  Other tools which have a fixed view for one host (eg <b><a href="../man1/mpvis.1.html">mpvis</a></b>(1)), may be
           launched multiple times, once for each host in the selected metric list.  If the launched tools  have
           time controls, they will share the time controls with the launching <b>pmview</b>.

           The  set  of  launched  tools  is  configurable,  and  may  include  IRIX and user applications.  See
           <b><a href="../man5/pmlaunch.5.html">pmlaunch</a></b>(5) for more details.

       <b>Help/...</b>
           If <u>pcp.books.help</u> has been installed, then the <b><a href="../man1/insight.1.html">insight</a></b>(1) books for <b>pmview</b> are displayed.

</pre><h4><b>TIME</b> <b>CONTROLS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the menu options for time controls, the  current  direction  of  the  time  controls  (see
       <b><a href="../man1/pmtime.1.html">pmtime</a></b>(1))  is  shown in a button in the top-left corner of the <b>pmview</b> window.  Pressing this button will
       display the time control and is identical in behavior to <b>Options/Show</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Control</b>.

</pre><h4><b>SCALE</b> <b>CONTROLS</b></h4><pre>
       Above the examiner window is a thumb wheel and an editable text box which  allow  the  user  to  apply  a
       multiplier to all values represented in the scene.  Spinning the wheel to the right and/or increasing the
       text  value  for  the  scale will increase the height of the bars.  Spinning the wheel to the left and/or
       lowering the text value will decrease the height of the bars.  The button to the right of the thumb wheel
       will reset the scale so that the bars appear at the original height for their current value.

</pre><h4><b>TIME</b> <b>INFORMATION</b></h4><pre>
       Beside the scale controls is another text box which displays the time of the fetched metrics.   The  time
       will change with the time controller (see <b><a href="../man1/pmtime.1.html">pmtime</a></b>(1)).

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Are  intended  to  be  self-explanatory.   The  environment  variable <b>PCP_STDERR</b> can be set to force most
       startup warnings and errors to be sent to the standard error stream rather than posted in a dialog.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/*</u>
            default PMNS specification files

       <u>$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlaunch/pmlaunchrc</u>
            menu specification file - provides a mapping between menu item and launched program

       <u>$HOME/.pcp/pmlaunch/pmlaunchrc</u>
            individual users menu specification

       <u>/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/PmView</u>
            application resources

       <u>/usr/lib/images/PmView.icon</u>
            icon for <b>pmview</b>

       <u>$PCP_SHARE_DIR/lib/pmview-args</u>
            shell procedures for parsing <b>pmview</b> command line options in front end scripts

       <u>/usr/lib/DPS/outline/base/</u>
            directory where Inventor normally looks for the outlines of Type1 fonts.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The default face of the 3D font in the <b>pmview</b> window can be altered via <u>PMVIEW_FONT</u> environment  variable
       which can be set to the base name of a Type1 font file in the default Inventor fonts directory.

</pre><h4><b>PCP</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Environment  variables with the prefix <b>PCP_</b> are used to parameterize the file and directory names used by
       PCP.  On each installation, the file <u>/etc/pcp.conf</u> contains the local values for  these  variables.   The
