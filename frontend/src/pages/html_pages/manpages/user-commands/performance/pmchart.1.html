</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pmchart</b>  is a graphical utility that plots performance metrics values available through the facilities of
       the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP).  Multiple charts can be displayed simultaneously, either aligned  on  the
       unified time axis (X-axis), and through the use of multiple interface Tabs.

       Metric  values  can  be sourced from one or more live hosts (simultaneously).  Alternatively, one or more
       sets of PCP archives can be used as a source  of  historical  data.   See  <b><a href="../man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro</a></b>(1)  for  an  in-depth
       discussion of the capabilities of the PCP framework, many of which are used by <b>pmchart.</b>

       Many aspects of the behaviour of <b>pmchart</b> can be customised through the interface.  In particular, the use
       of  "views"  (refer  to  the  section  describing VIEWS later in this document) allows predefined sets of
       metrics and charting parameters like colors, scaling, titles, legends, and so on to be stored  for  later
       use,  or  use  with  different  hosts  and  sets of archives.  In addition, the Preferences dialog allows
       customisations to the rest of the <b>pmchart</b> user interface to  be  saved  and  restored  between  different
       invocations  of  the  tool.   This  allows  the  default  background color, highlight color, contents and
       location of the toolbar, and many other aspects to be configured.

       <b>pmchart</b> makes extensive use of the <b><a href="../man1/pmtime.1.html">pmtime</a></b>(1) utility for time control, refer to the  <b>pmtime</b>  manual  page
       for further details of its operation.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The available command line options are:

       <b>-a</b> <u>archive</u>, <b>--archive</b>=<u>archive</u>
            Performance  metric  values  are  retrieved  from  the  set  of  Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archives
            identified by this option, by default.  The argument is a comma-separated list  of  names,  each  of
            which may be the base name of an archive or the name of a directory containing one or more archives.
            The  resulting  set  of  archives  will  be  the source of the performance metrics.  The initial Tab
            created will be an archive mode Tab.  Multiple <b>-a</b> options can be presented, and the  resulting  list
            of  sets of archives is used for sourcing metric values.  Any <u>sources</u> listed on the command line are
            assumed to be sets of archives if this option is used.

       <b>-A</b> <u>align</u>, <b>--align</b>=<u>align</u>
            Force the initial sample to be aligned on the boundary of a  natural  time  unit  <u>align</u>.   Refer  to
            <b><a href="../man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro</a></b>(1) for a complete description of the syntax for <u>align</u>.

       <b>--archive-folio</b>=<u>folio</u>
            Read metric source archives from the PCP archive <u>folio</u>.

       <b>-c</b> <u>configfile</u>, <b>--view</b>=<u>configfile</u>
            <u>configfile</u>  specifies  an  initial  view  to load, using the default source of metrics.  Multiple <b>-c</b>
            views can be specified, and they will all be opened in the default Tab with the  default  source  of
            metrics.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--check</b>
            Used  with  <b>-c</b>,  the  view(s)  are  parsed,  any  errors  are reported, and the tool exits.  This is
            primarily intended for testing purposes.  If a second <b>-C</b> option is presented, <b>pmchart</b> also  connects
            to <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1) to check the semantics of metrics.

       <b>-f</b> <u>family</u>, <b>--font-family</b>=<u>family</u>
            Specify  the  default  font  <u>family</u> to be used in several chart components, such as the chart title,
            legend, and Y-axis label.  The default value is "Sans Serif".  This setting does not affect the rest
            of the user interface, where the value is inherited from the environment in which <b>pmchart</b>  operates,
            and differs according to the look-and-feel of each platform.

       <b>-F</b> <u>point</u>, <b>--font-size</b>=<u>point</u>
            Specify the default font <u>point</u> size to be used in several chart components, such as the chart title,
            legend, and Y-axis label.  The default is platform dependent, but is either 7, 8 or 9.  This setting
            does not affect the rest of the user interface.

       <b>-g</b> <u>geometry</u>, <b>--geometry</b>=<u>geometry</u>
            Generate image with the specified <u>geometry</u> (width and height).  This option is only useful when used
            in  conjunction  with the <b>-o</b> option for generating an output image.  The <u>geometry</u> argument takes the
            form "WxH" (e.g. 240x120).  When NOT using the <b>-o</b> flag, to specify the display window geometry,  use
            <b>-geometry</b> <u>geometry</u> where <u>geometry</u> specifies the desired window width, height and optional placement.

       <b>-h</b> <u>host</u>, <b>--host</b>=<u>host</u>
            Current  performance  metric  values  are  retrieved  from  the  nominated  <u>host</u> machine by default.
            Multiple <b>-h</b> options can be presented, and the list of hosts is used for sourcing metric values.  Any
            <u>sources</u> listed on the command line are assumed to be hosts if this option is used.

       <b>-H</b> <u>path</u>, <b>--hostsfile</b>=<u>path</u>
            Specify the <u>path</u> to a file containing a set of hostnames where <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1)  is  running  ,  rather  than
            using the default localhost.

       <b>-K</b> <u>spec</u>, <b>--spec-local</b>=<u>spec</u>
            When  fetching  metrics  from a local context (see <b>-L</b>), the <b>-K</b> option may be used to control the DSO
            PMDAs that should be made accessible.  The  <u>spec</u>  argument  conforms  to  the  syntax  described  in
            <b><a href="../man3/pmSpecLocalPMDA.3.html">pmSpecLocalPMDA</a></b>(3).  More than one <b>-K</b> option may be used.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--local-PMDA</b>
            Use a local context to collect metrics from DSO PMDAs on the local host without PMCD.  See also <b>-K</b>.

       <b>-n</b> <u>pmnsfile</u>, <b>--namespace</b>=<u>pmnsfile</u>
            Load an alternative Performance Metrics Name Space (<b><a href="../man5/PMNS.5.html">PMNS</a></b>(5)) from the file <u>pmnsfile</u>.

       <b>-o</b> <u>outfile</u>, <b>--output</b>=<u>outfile</u>
            Generate  an  image  file  named <u>outfile</u>, and then exit.  This is most useful when run with a set of
            archives and one or more views.  The generated image will be in the format  specified  as  the  file
            extension  (automatically determined from <u>outfile</u>).  If no extension can be determined, then the GIF
            format is used and the generated file is named  with  this  extension.   The  supported  image  file
            formats include: bmp, jpeg, jpg, png, ppm, tif, tiff, xbm, and xpm.

       <b>-O</b> <u>origin</u>, <b>--origin</b>=<u>origin</u>
            When  reporting  archived metrics, start reporting at <u>origin</u> within the time window (see <b>-S</b> and <b>-T</b>).
            Refer to <b><a href="../man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro</a></b>(1) for a complete description of the syntax for <u>origin</u>.

       <b>-p</b> <u>port</u>, <b>--guiport</b>=<u>port</u>
            <u>port</u> number for connection to an existing <b>pmtime</b> time control process.

       <b>-s</b> <u>samples</u>, <b>--samples</b>=<u>samples</u>
            Specifies the number of <u>samples</u> that will be retained before discarding old data  (replaced  by  new
            values  at the current time position).  This value can subsequently be modified through the Edit Tab
            dialog.

       <b>-S</b> <u>starttime</u>, <b>--start</b>=<u>starttime</u>
            When reporting archived metrics, the report will be restricted to those records logged at  or  after
            <u>starttime</u>.  Refer to <b><a href="../man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro</a></b>(1) for a complete description of the syntax for <u>starttime</u>.

       <b>-t</b> <u>interval</u>, <b>--interval</b>=<u>interval</u>
            Sets  the  initial  update  <u>interval</u>  to  something  other  than the default 1 second.  The <u>interval</u>
            argument follows the syntax described in <b><a href="../man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro</a></b>(1), and in the simplest form may  be  an  unsigned
            integer (the implied units in this case are seconds).

       <b>-T</b> <u>endtime</u>, <b>--finish</b>=<u>endtime</u>
            When  reporting archived metrics, the report will be restricted to those records logged before or at
            <u>endtime</u>.  Refer to <b><a href="../man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro</a></b>(1) for a complete description of the syntax for <u>endtime</u>.

       <b>-v</b> <u>samples</u>, <b>--visible</b>=<u>samples</u>
            Sets the initial visible <u>samples</u> that will be displayed in all charts  in  the  default  Tab.   This
            value must be less than or equal to the total number of samples retained (the <b>-s</b> value).

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
            Display pmchart version number and exit

       <b>-W</b>, <b>--white</b>
            Export images using an opaque(white) background

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--hostzone</b>
            Change  the  reporting  timezone  to  the  local  timezone  at  the  host  that is the source of the
            performance metrics, as identified via either the <b>-h</b> or <b>-a</b> options.

       <b>-Z</b> <u>timezone</u>, <b>--timezone</b>=<u>timezone</u>
            By default, <b>pmtime</b> reports the time of day according to the  local  timezone  on  the  system  where
            <b>pmchart</b>  is  run.   The  <b>-Z</b> option changes the timezone to <u>timezone</u> in the format of the environment
            variable TZ as described in <b><a href="../man7/environ.7.html">environ</a></b>(7).

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
            Display usage message and exit.

</pre><h4><b>VIEWS</b></h4><pre>
       The primary <b>pmchart</b> configuration file is the "view", which allows the metadata associated  with  one  or
       more  charts to be saved in the filesystem.  This metadata describes all aspects of the charts, including
       which PCP metrics and instances are to be used, which hosts, which colors, the chart titles, use of chart
       legends, and much more.

       From a conceptual point of view, there are two classes of view.  These views share the same configuration
       file format - refer to a later section for a complete description of this format.  The differences lie in
       where they are installed and how they are manipulated.

       The first class, the "system" view, is simply any view that is installed as part of the <b>pmchart</b>  package.
       These  are  stored  in  <u>$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmchart.</u>   When the <u>File→Open</u> <u>View</u> dialog is displayed, it is
       these views that are initially listed.  The system views cannot be modified by a normal user, and  should
       not be modified even by a user with suitable privileges, as they will be overwritten during an upgrade.

       The second class of view is the "user" view.  These views are created on-the-fly using the <u>File→Save</u> <u>View</u>
       dialog.   This  is  a  mechanism for individual users to save their commonly used views.  Access to these
       views is achieved through the <u>File→Open</u> <u>View</u> dialog, as with  the  system  views.   Once  the  dialog  is
       opened,  the  list  of  views  can be toggled between user and system views by clicking on the two toggle
       buttons in the top right corner.  User views are stored in <u>$HOME/.pcp/pmchart.</u>

</pre><h4><b>TABS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pmchart</b> provides the common user interface concept of the Tab, which is  most  prevalent  in  modern  web
       browsers.  Tabs allow <b>pmchart</b> to update many more charts than the available screen real estate allows, by
       providing  a  user  interface  mechanism to stack (and switch between) different vertical sets of charts.
       Switching between Tabs is achieved by clicking on the Tab labels, which are located along the top of  the
       display beneath the Menu and Tool bars).

       Each  Tab  has  a  mode  of  operation  (either  live  or  archive  -  <b>pmchart</b>  can  support  both  modes
       simultaneously), the total number of samples and currently visible points, and a label describing the Tab
       which is displayed at the top of the <b>pmchart</b> window.  New Tabs can be  created  using  the  <u>File→Add</u>  <u>Tab</u>
       dialog.

       In  order  to  save  on  vertical  screen  real estate, note that the user interface element for changing
       between different Tabs (and its label) are only displayed when more than one Tab exists.  A  Tab  can  be
       dismissed using the <u>File→Close</u> <u>Tab</u> menu, which removes the current Tab and any charts it contained.

</pre><h4><b>IMAGES</b> <b>and</b> <b>PRINTING</b></h4><pre>
       A static copy of the currently displayed vertical series of charts can be captured in two ways.

       When  the intended display device is the screen, the <u>File→Export</u> menu option should be used.  This allows
       exporting the charts in a variety of image formats, including PNG, JPEG, GIF, and BMP.   The  image  size
       can be scaled up or down in any dimension.

       Alternatively,  when  the intended display device is paper, the <u>File→Print</u> menu option can be used.  This
       supports the usual set of printing  options  (choice  of  printer,  grayscale/color,  landscape/portrait,
       scaling  to  different  paper  sizes,  etc),  and in addition allows printing to the intermediate printer
       formats of PostScript and Portable Document Format (PDF).

</pre><h4><b>RECORDING</b></h4><pre>
       It is possible to make a recording of a set of displayed charts, for later playback  through  <b>pmchart</b>  or
       any  of  the  other  Performance  Co-Pilot  tools.  The <u>Record→Start</u> functionality is simple to configure
       through the user interface, and allows fine-tuning of the recording process (including record frequencies
       that differ to the <b>pmchart</b> update interval, alternate file locations, etc).

       <b>pmchart</b> produces recordings that are compatible  with  the  PCP  <b><a href="../man1/pmafm.1.html">pmafm</a></b>(1)  replay  mechanism,  for  later
       playback  via a new instance of <b>pmchart</b>.  In addition, when recording through <b>pmchart</b> one can also replay
       the recording immediately, as on termination of the recording (through the  <u>Record→Stop</u>  menu  item),  an
       archive mode Tab will be created with the captured view.

       Once  recording  is active in a Live Tab, the Time Control status button in the bottom left corner of the
       <b>pmchart</b> window is displayed with a distinctive red dot.  At any time during a <b>pmchart</b> recording  session,
       the amount of space used in the filesystem by that recording can be displayed using the <u>Record→Query</u> menu
       item.

       Finally,  the  <u>Record→Detach</u>  menu  option  provides  a  mechanism  whereby  the recording process can be
       completely divorced from the running <b>pmchart</b> process, and allowed to continue on when <b>pmchart</b>  exits.   A
       dialog  displaying  the current size and estimated rate of growth for the recording is presented.  On the
       other hand, if <b>pmchart</b> is terminated while recording is in  process,  then  the  recording  process  will
       prompt the user to choose immediate cessation of recording or for it to continue on independently.

       All  of  the  record mode services available from <b>pmchart</b> are implemented with the assistance of the base
       Performance Co-Pilot logging services - refer to <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/pmafm.1.html">pmafm</a></b>(1) for an extensive description of
       the capabilities of these tools.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pmchart</b> loads predefined chart configurations (or "views")  from  external  files  that  conform  to  the
       following  rules.  In the descriptions below keywords (shown in <b>bold</b>) may appear in upper, lower or mixed
       case, elements shown in [stuff] are optional, and user-supplied elements are shown as &lt;other  stuff&gt;.   A
       vertical  bar  (|)  is used where syntactic elements are alternatives.  Quotes (") may be used to enclose
       lexical elements that may contain white space, such as titles, labels and instance names.

       1. The first line defines the configuration file type and should be
               <b>#kmchart</b>
          although <b>pmchart</b> provides backwards compatibility for the older <b>pmchart</b> view formats with  an  initial
          line of
               <b>#pmchart</b>

       2. After  the  first line, lines beginning with "#" as the first non-white space character are treated as
          comments and skipped.  Similarly blank lines are skipped.

       3. The next line should be
               <b>version</b> &lt;n&gt; &lt;host-clause&gt;
          where &lt;n&gt; depends on the configuration file type, and is <b>1</b> for  <b>pmchart</b>  else  <b>1.1</b>,  <b>1.2</b>  or  <b>2.0</b>  for
          <b>pmchart</b>.
          The &lt;host-clause&gt; part is optional (and ignored) for <b>pmchart</b> configuration files, but required for the
          <b>pmchart</b> configuration files, and is of the form
               <b>host</b> <b>literal</b>
          or
               <b>host</b> <b>dynamic</b>

       4. A configuration contains one or more charts defined as follows:
               <b>chart</b> [<b>title</b> &lt;title&gt;] <b>style</b> &lt;style&gt; &lt;options&gt;
          If  specified,  the  title  will appear centred and above the graph area of the chart.  The &lt;title&gt; is
          usually enclosed in quotes (") and if it contains the sequence "%h" this will be replaced by the short
          form of the hostname  for  the  default  source  of  metrics  at  the  time  this  chart  was  loaded.
          Alternatively,  "%H"  can be used to insert the full host name.  If the hostname appears to be an inet
          or IPv6 address, no shortening will be attempted; it will be used as-is  in  both  replacement  cases.
          After  the  view  is loaded, the title visibility and setting can be manipulated using the <u>Chart</u> <u>Title</u>
          text box in the <u>Edit→Chart</u> dialog.

          The &lt;style&gt; controls the initial plotting style of the chart, and should be one of the  keywords  <b>plot</b>
          (line  graph),  <b>bar</b>,  <b>stacking</b>  (stacked  bar),  <b>area</b>  or  <b>utilization</b>.  After the view is loaded, the
          plotting style can be changed using the <u>Edit→Chart</u> Style drop-down list.

          The &lt;options&gt; are zero or more of the optional elements:
               [<b>scale</b> [from] &lt;ymin&gt; [to] &lt;ymax&gt;] [<b>legend</b> &lt;onoff&gt;]
          If <b>scale</b> is specified, the vertical scaling is set for all plots in the chart to a y-range defined  by
          &lt;ymin&gt; and &lt;ymax&gt;.  Otherwise the vertical axis will be autoscaled based on the values currently being
          plotted.

          &lt;onoff&gt; is one of the keywords <b>on</b> or <b>off</b> and the <b>legend</b> clause controls the presence or absence of the
          plot  legend  below  the  graph  area.   The default is for the legend to be shown.  After the view is
          loaded, the legend visibility can be toggled using the <u>Show</u> <u>Legend</u> button in the <u>Edit→Chart</u> dialog.

       5. <b>pmchart</b> supports a <b>global</b> clause to specify the dimensions of the top-level window  (using  the  <b>width</b>
          and  <b>height</b>  keywords),  the  number  of visible points (<b>points</b> keyword) and the starting X and Y axis
          positions on the screen (<b>xpos</b> and <b>ypos</b> keywords).  Each of these <b>global</b> attributes  takes  an  integer
          value as the sole qualifier.

       6. Each  <b>chart</b>  has  one  or  more  plots  associated  with  it,  as  defined  by  one  of  the following
          specifications:
               <b>plot</b>
                   [<b>legend</b> &lt;title&gt;] [<b>color</b> &lt;colorspec&gt;] [<b>host</b> &lt;hostspec&gt;]
                   <b>metric</b> &lt;metricname&gt;
                   [ <b>instance</b> &lt;inst&gt; | <b>matching</b> &lt;pat&gt; | <b>not-matching</b> &lt;pat&gt; ]

          The keyword <b>plot</b> may be replaced with the keyword <b>optional-plot</b>,  in  which  case  if  the  source  of
          performance  data does not include the specified performance metric and/or instance, then this plot is
          silently dropped from the chart.

          If specified, the title will appear in the chart legend.  The &lt;title&gt; is usually  enclosed  in  quotes
          (")  and  it  may  contain  one  or more wildcard characters which will be expanded using metric name,
          instance name, and host name for the plot.  The wildcards are "%i" (short unique instance name, up  to
          the  first  whitespace),  "%I"  (full  instance name), "%h" (short host name, up to the first dot), %H
          (full host name), "%m" (metric name shortened to the final two PMNS components), and "%M" (full metric
          name).

          For older <b>pmchart</b> configuration files, the keyword <b>title</b> must be used  instead  of  <b>legend</b>.   Nowadays
          <b>pmchart</b> supports either keyword.

          The  <b>color</b>  clause  is  optional  for  newer  <b>pmchart</b> configuration files, but it was mandatory in the
          original <b>pmchart</b> configuration file format.  &lt;colorspec&gt; may be one of the following:
               <b>#-cycle</b>
               <b>rgbi:</b>rr<b>:</b>gg<b>:</b>bb
               <b>#</b>rgb
               <b>#</b>rrggbb
               <b>#</b>rrrgggbbb
               <b>#</b>rrrrggggbbbb
               &lt;Xcolor&gt;
          where each of r, g and b are hexadecimal digits (0-9 and A-F) representing respectively the red, green
          and blue color components.  &lt;Xcolor&gt; is one of the color names from the X color database, e.g. <b>red</b>  or
          <b>steelblue</b>, see also the output from <b><a href="../man1/showrgb.1.html">showrgb</a></b>(1).

          The  "color"  <b>#-cycle</b>  specifies  that  <b>pmchart</b> should use the next in a pallet of colors that it uses
          cyclically for each chart.  This is the default if the <b>color</b> clause is omitted.

          The &lt;hostspec&gt; in the <b>host</b> clause may be a hostname, an IP address or an asterisk (*); the  latter  is
          used  to  mean  the default source of performance metrics.  For older <b>pmchart</b> configuration files, the
          <b>host</b> clause must be present, for new <b>pmchart</b> configuration files it is optional, and  if  missing  the
          default source of performance metrics will be used.

          The optional instance specification,

          (a)
             is omitted in which case one plot will be created for every instance of the &lt;metricname&gt; metric

          (b)
             starts with <b>instance</b>, in which case only the instance named &lt;inst&gt; will be plotted

          (c)
             starts  with  <b>matching</b>,  in  which  case  all instances whose names match the pattern &lt;pat&gt; will be
             plotted; the pattern uses extended regular expression notation in the style of <b><a href="../man1/egrep.1.html">egrep</a></b>(1)  (refer  to
             the PMCD view for an example)

          (d)
             starts  with <b>not-matching</b>, in which case all instances whose names <b>do</b>   <b>not</b> match the pattern &lt;pat&gt;
             will be plotted; the pattern uses extended regular expression notation in  the  style  of  <b><a href="../man1/egrep.1.html">egrep</a></b>(1)
             (refer to the Netbytes view for an example)

          <b>pmchart</b> uses a bizarre syntactic notation where &lt;inst&gt; and &lt;pat&gt; extend from the first non-white space
          character  to  the  end  of the input line.  For <b>pmchart</b> configuration files these elements are either
          delimited by white space, or enclosed in quotes (").

       7. The optional <b>tab</b> directive can be used to create views with multiple charts which span multiple  Tabs.
          The syntax is as follows:
               <b>tab</b> &lt;label&gt; [<b>host</b> &lt;host&gt;] [<b>points</b> &lt;points&gt; [<b>samples</b> &lt;samples&gt;]]

          All chart specifications following this keyword will be created
          on the new Tab, until the end of the configuration file or until
          another <b>tab</b> keyword is encountered.

</pre><h4><b>PCP</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Environment  variables with the prefix <b>PCP_</b> are used to parameterize the file and directory names used by
       PCP.  On each installation, the file <u>/etc/pcp.conf</u> contains the local values for  these  variables.   The
       <b>$PCP_CONF</b> variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration file, as described in <b><a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf</a></b>(5).

       Of  particular  note,  the  <b>$PCP_XCONFIRM_PROG</b>  setting  is  explicitly and unconditionally overridden by
       <b>pmchart</b>.  This is set to the <b><a href="../man1/pmconfirm.1.html">pmconfirm</a></b>(1), utility, in order that some popup dialogs (particularly in the
       area of Recording) maintain a consistent look-and-feel with the rest of the <b>pmchart</b> application.
