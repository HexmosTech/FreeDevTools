       Only the most useful options are given above; see below for a more complete list of preprocessor-specific
       options.  In addition, <b>cpp</b> accepts most <b>gcc</b> driver options, which are not listed here.  Refer to the GCC
       documentation for details.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C preprocessor, often known as <u>cpp</u>, is a <u>macro</u> <u>processor</u> that is used automatically by the C compiler
       to transform your program before compilation.  It is called a macro processor because it allows you to
       define <u>macros</u>, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs.

       The C preprocessor is intended to be used only with C, C++, and Objective-C source code.  In the past, it
       has been abused as a general text processor.  It will choke on input which does not obey C's lexical
       rules.  For example, apostrophes will be interpreted as the beginning of character constants, and cause
       errors.  Also, you cannot rely on it preserving characteristics of the input which are not significant to
       C-family languages.  If a Makefile is preprocessed, all the hard tabs will be removed, and the Makefile
       will not work.

       Having said that, you can often get away with using cpp on things which are not C.  Other Algol-ish
       programming languages are often safe (Ada, etc.) So is assembly, with caution.  <b>-traditional-cpp</b> mode
       preserves more white space, and is otherwise more permissive.  Many of the problems can be avoided by
       writing C or C++ style comments instead of native language comments, and keeping macros simple.

       Wherever possible, you should use a preprocessor geared to the language you are writing in.  Modern
       versions of the GNU assembler have macro facilities.  Most high level programming languages have their
       own conditional compilation and inclusion mechanism.  If all else fails, try a true general text
       processor, such as GNU M4.

       C preprocessors vary in some details.  This manual discusses the GNU C preprocessor, which provides a
       small superset of the features of ISO Standard C.  In its default mode, the GNU C preprocessor does not
       do a few things required by the standard.  These are features which are rarely, if ever, used, and may
       cause surprising changes to the meaning of a program which does not expect them.  To get strict ISO
       Standard C, you should use the <b>-std=c90</b>, <b>-std=c99</b>, <b>-std=c11</b> or <b>-std=c17</b> options, depending on which
       version of the standard you want.  To get all the mandatory diagnostics, you must also use <b>-pedantic</b>.

       This manual describes the behavior of the ISO preprocessor.  To minimize gratuitous differences, where
       the ISO preprocessor's behavior does not conflict with traditional semantics, the traditional
       preprocessor should behave the same way.  The various differences that do exist are detailed in the
       section <b>Traditional</b> <b>Mode</b>.

       For clarity, unless noted otherwise, references to <b>CPP</b> in this manual refer to GNU CPP.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>cpp</b> command expects two file names as arguments, <u>infile</u> and <u>outfile</u>.  The preprocessor reads <u>infile</u>
       together with any other files it specifies with <b>#include</b>.  All the output generated by the combined input
       files is written in <u>outfile</u>.

       Either <u>infile</u> or <u>outfile</u> may be <b>-</b>, which as <u>infile</u> means to read from standard input and as <u>outfile</u> means
       to write to standard output.  If either file is omitted, it means the same as if <b>-</b> had been specified for
       that file.  You can also use the <b>-o</b> <u>outfile</u> option to specify the output file.

       Unless otherwise noted, or the option ends in <b>=</b>, all options which take an argument may have that
       argument appear either immediately after the option, or with a space between option and argument: <b>-Ifoo</b>
       and <b>-I</b> <b>foo</b> have the same effect.

       Many options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter options may <u>not</u> be grouped: <b>-dM</b> is
       very different from <b>-d</b> <b>-M</b>.

       <b>-D</b> <u>name</u>
           Predefine <u>name</u> as a macro, with definition 1.

       <b>-D</b> <u>name</u><b>=</b><u>definition</u>
           The  contents  of <u>definition</u> are tokenized and processed as if they appeared during translation phase
           three in a <b>#define</b> directive.  In  particular,  the  definition  is  truncated  by  embedded  newline
           characters.

           If  you  are  invoking  the  preprocessor  from a shell or shell-like program you may need to use the
           shell's quoting syntax to protect characters such as spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax.

           If you wish to define a function-like macro on  the  command  line,  write  its  argument  list  with
           surrounding  parentheses before the equals sign (if any).  Parentheses are meaningful to most shells,
           so you should quote the option.  With <b>sh</b> and <b>csh</b>, <b>-D'</b><u>name</u><b>(</b><u>args...</u><b>)=</b><u>definition</u><b>'</b> works.

           <b>-D</b> and <b>-U</b> options are processed in the order they are given on the command line.  All  <b>-imacros</b>  <u>file</u>
           and <b>-include</b> <u>file</u> options are processed after all <b>-D</b> and <b>-U</b> options.

       <b>-U</b> <u>name</u>
           Cancel any previous definition of <u>name</u>, either built in or provided with a <b>-D</b> option.

       <b>-include</b> <u>file</u>
           Process <u>file</u> as if "#include "file"" appeared as the first line of the primary source file.  However,
           the  first  directory  searched  for  <u>file</u>  is  the  preprocessor's  working directory <u>instead</u> <u>of</u> the
           directory containing the main source file.  If not found there, it is searched for in  the  remainder
           of the "#include "..."" search chain as normal.

           If  multiple  <b>-include</b>  options  are  given,  the  files are included in the order they appear on the
           command line.

       <b>-imacros</b> <u>file</u>
           Exactly like <b>-include</b>, except that any output produced by scanning <u>file</u> is thrown  away.   Macros  it
           defines  remain  defined.   This  allows  you  to  acquire  all the macros from a header without also
           processing its declarations.

           All files specified by <b>-imacros</b> are processed before all files specified by <b>-include</b>.

       <b>-undef</b>
           Do not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros.  The standard predefined  macros  remain
           defined.

       <b>-pthread</b>
           Define  additional  macros  required for using the POSIX threads library.  You should use this option
           consistently for both compilation and linking.  This option is supported on GNU/Linux  targets,  most
           other Unix derivatives, and also on x86 Cygwin and MinGW targets.

       <b>-M</b>  Instead  of  outputting  the  result of preprocessing, output a rule suitable for <b>make</b> describing the
           dependencies of the main source file.  The preprocessor outputs one <b>make</b> rule containing  the  object
           file  name  for  that  source file, a colon, and the names of all the included files, including those
           coming from <b>-include</b> or <b>-imacros</b> command-line options.

           Unless specified explicitly (with <b>-MT</b> or <b>-MQ</b>), the object file name  consists  of  the  name  of  the
           source  file  with  any  suffix replaced with object file suffix and with any leading directory parts
           removed.  If there are many included files then the rule is split into several lines using <b>\</b>-newline.
           The rule has no commands.

           This option does not suppress the preprocessor's debug output, such as <b>-dM</b>.   To  avoid  mixing  such
           debug  output with the dependency rules you should explicitly specify the dependency output file with
           <b>-MF</b>, or use an environment variable like <b>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</b>.  Debug output  is  still  sent  to  the
           regular output stream as normal.

           Passing <b>-M</b> to the driver implies <b>-E</b>, and suppresses warnings with an implicit <b>-w</b>.

       <b>-MM</b> Like <b>-M</b> but do not mention header files that are found in system header directories, nor header files
           that are included, directly or indirectly, from such a header.

           This  implies that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in an <b>#include</b> directive does not in
           itself determine whether that header appears in <b>-MM</b> dependency output.

       <b>-MF</b> <u>file</u>
           When used with <b>-M</b> or <b>-MM</b>, specifies a file to write the dependencies to.  If no <b>-MF</b> switch  is  given
           the preprocessor sends the rules to the same place it would send preprocessed output.

           When used with the driver options <b>-MD</b> or <b>-MMD</b>, <b>-MF</b> overrides the default dependency output file.

           If <u>file</u> is <u>-</u>, then the dependencies are written to <u>stdout</u>.

       <b>-MG</b> In conjunction with an option such as <b>-M</b> requesting dependency generation, <b>-MG</b> assumes missing header
           files  are  generated  files  and  adds  them  to  the dependency list without raising an error.  The
           dependency filename is taken directly from the "#include" directive without prepending any path.  <b>-MG</b>
           also suppresses preprocessed output, as a missing header file renders this useless.

           This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.

       <b>-Mno-modules</b>
           Disable dependency generation for compiled module interfaces.

       <b>-MP</b> This option instructs CPP to add a phony target for each dependency other than the main file, causing
           each to depend on nothing.  These dummy rules work around errors <b>make</b>  gives  if  you  remove  header
           files without updating the <u>Makefile</u> to match.

           This is typical output:

                   test.o: test.c test.h

                   test.h:

       <b>-MT</b> <u>target</u>
           Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency generation.  By default CPP takes the name of the
           main  input  file,  deletes  any directory components and any file suffix such as <b>.c</b>, and appends the
           platform's usual object suffix.  The result is the target.

           An <b>-MT</b> option sets the target to be exactly the string you specify.  If you  want  multiple  targets,
           you can specify them as a single argument to <b>-MT</b>, or use multiple <b>-MT</b> options.

           For example, <b>-MT</b> <b>'$(objpfx)foo.o'</b> might give

                   $(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c

       <b>-MQ</b> <u>target</u>
           Same as <b>-MT</b>, but it quotes any characters which are special to Make.  <b>-MQ</b> <b>'$(objpfx)foo.o'</b> gives

                   $$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c

           The default target is automatically quoted, as if it were given with <b>-MQ</b>.

       <b>-MD</b> <b>-MD</b> is equivalent to <b>-M</b> <b>-MF</b> <u>file</u>, except that <b>-E</b> is not implied.  The driver determines <u>file</u> based on
           whether  an  <b>-o</b>  option  is  given.   If it is, the driver uses its argument but with a suffix of <u>.d</u>,
           otherwise it takes the name of the input file, removes  any  directory  components  and  suffix,  and
           applies a <u>.d</u> suffix.

           If  <b>-MD</b>  is used in conjunction with <b>-E</b>, any <b>-o</b> switch is understood to specify the dependency output
           file, but if used without <b>-E</b>, each <b>-o</b> is understood to specify a target object file.

           Since <b>-E</b> is not implied, <b>-MD</b> can be used to generate a dependency output file as a side effect of the
           compilation process.

       <b>-MMD</b>
           Like <b>-MD</b> except mention only user header files, not system header files.

       <b>-fpreprocessed</b>
           Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has  already  been  preprocessed.   This  suppresses
           things  like  macro  expansion, trigraph conversion, escaped newline splicing, and processing of most
           directives.  The preprocessor still recognizes and removes comments, so that  you  can  pass  a  file
           preprocessed  with  <b>-C</b> to the compiler without problems.  In this mode the integrated preprocessor is
           little more than a tokenizer for the front ends.

           <b>-fpreprocessed</b> is implicit if the input file has one of the extensions <b>.i</b>, <b>.ii</b> or <b>.mi</b>.  These are the
           extensions that GCC uses for preprocessed files created by <b>-save-temps</b>.

       <b>-fdirectives-only</b>
           When preprocessing, handle directives, but do not expand macros.

           The option's behavior depends on the <b>-E</b> and <b>-fpreprocessed</b> options.

           With <b>-E</b>, preprocessing is limited to the handling of directives  such  as  "#define",  "#ifdef",  and
           "#error".   Other  preprocessor  operations,  such as macro expansion and trigraph conversion are not
           performed.  In addition, the <b>-dD</b> option is implicitly enabled.

           With <b>-fpreprocessed</b>, predefinition of command line and most builtin macros is disabled.  Macros  such
           as  "__LINE__",  which are contextually dependent, are handled normally.  This enables compilation of
           files previously preprocessed with "-E -fdirectives-only".

           With both <b>-E</b> and <b>-fpreprocessed</b>, the rules for <b>-fpreprocessed</b> take  precedence.   This  enables  full
           preprocessing of files previously preprocessed with "-E -fdirectives-only".

       <b>-fdollars-in-identifiers</b>
           Accept <b>$</b> in identifiers.

       <b>-fextended-identifiers</b>
           Accept  universal  character names and extended characters in identifiers.  This option is enabled by
           default for C99 (and later C standard versions) and C++.

       <b>-fno-canonical-system-headers</b>
           When preprocessing, do not shorten system header paths with canonicalization.

       <b>-fmax-include-depth=</b><u>depth</u>
           Set the maximum depth of the nested #include. The default is 200.

       <b>-ftabstop=</b><u>width</u>
           Set the distance between tab stops.  This helps the preprocessor report  correct  column  numbers  in
           warnings  or  errors,  even  if tabs appear on the line.  If the value is less than 1 or greater than
           100, the option is ignored.  The default is 8.

       <b>-ftrack-macro-expansion</b>[<b>=</b><u>level</u>]
           Track locations of tokens across macro expansions. This allows the compiler to emit diagnostic  about
           the  current  macro  expansion stack when a compilation error occurs in a macro expansion. Using this
           option makes the preprocessor and the compiler consume more memory. The <u>level</u> parameter can  be  used
           to choose the level of precision of token location tracking thus decreasing the memory consumption if
           necessary.  Value  <b>0</b> of <u>level</u> de-activates this option. Value <b>1</b> tracks tokens locations in a degraded
           mode for the sake of minimal memory overhead. In this mode all tokens resulting from the expansion of
           an argument of a function-like macro  have  the  same  location.  Value  <b>2</b>  tracks  tokens  locations
           completely. This value is the most memory hungry.  When this option is given no argument, the default
           parameter value is <b>2</b>.

           Note that "-ftrack-macro-expansion=2" is activated by default.

       <b>-fmacro-prefix-map=</b><u>old</u><b>=</b><u>new</u>
           When  preprocessing files residing in directory <u>old</u>, expand the "__FILE__" and "__BASE_FILE__" macros
           as if the files resided in directory <u>new</u> instead.  This can be used to change an absolute path  to  a
           relative  path  by  using  <u>.</u>  for  <u>new</u> which can result in more reproducible builds that are location
           independent.   This  option  also  affects   "__builtin_FILE()"   during   compilation.    See   also
           <b>-ffile-prefix-map</b>.

       <b>-fexec-charset=</b><u>charset</u>
           Set  the  execution  character  set,  used for string and character constants.  The default is UTF-8.
           <u>charset</u> can be any encoding supported by the system's "iconv" library routine.

       <b>-fwide-exec-charset=</b><u>charset</u>
           Set the wide execution character set, used for wide string and character constants.  The  default  is
           one of UTF-32BE, UTF-32LE, UTF-16BE, or UTF-16LE, whichever corresponds to the width of "wchar_t" and
           the  big-endian  or little-endian byte order being used for code generation.  As with <b>-fexec-charset</b>,
           <u>charset</u> can be any encoding supported by the system's "iconv" library routine; however, you will have
           problems with encodings that do not fit exactly in "wchar_t".

       <b>-finput-charset=</b><u>charset</u>
           Set the input character set, used for translation from the character set of the  input  file  to  the
           source character set used by GCC.  If the locale does not specify, or GCC cannot get this information
           from  the locale, the default is UTF-8.  This can be overridden by either the locale or this command-
           line option.  Currently the command-line option takes precedence if there's a conflict.  <u>charset</u>  can
           be any encoding supported by the system's "iconv" library routine.

       <b>-fworking-directory</b>
           Enable  generation  of  linemarkers in the preprocessor output that let the compiler know the current
           working directory at the time of preprocessing.  When this option is enabled, the preprocessor emits,
           after the initial linemarker, a second linemarker with the current working directory followed by  two
           slashes.   GCC  uses  this  directory,  when it's present in the preprocessed input, as the directory
           emitted as the current working directory in some  debugging  information  formats.   This  option  is
           implicitly  enabled  if  debugging information is enabled, but this can be inhibited with the negated
           form <b>-fno-working-directory</b>.  If the <b>-P</b> flag is present in the  command  line,  this  option  has  no
           effect, since no "#line" directives are emitted whatsoever.

       <b>-A</b> <u>predicate</u><b>=</b><u>answer</u>
           Make  an  assertion  with  the  predicate <u>predicate</u> and answer <u>answer</u>.  This form is preferred to the
           older form <b>-A</b> <u>predicate</u><b>(</b><u>answer</u><b>)</b>, which is still supported, because it  does  not  use  shell  special
           characters.

       <b>-A</b> <b>-</b><u>predicate</u><b>=</b><u>answer</u>
           Cancel an assertion with the predicate <u>predicate</u> and answer <u>answer</u>.

       <b>-C</b>  Do  not discard comments.  All comments are passed through to the output file, except for comments in
           processed directives, which are deleted along with the directive.

           You should be prepared for side effects when using <b>-C</b>; it causes the preprocessor to  treat  comments
           as  tokens  in  their  own  right.   For  example, comments appearing at the start of what would be a
           directive line have the effect of turning that line into an ordinary source  line,  since  the  first
           token on the line is no longer a <b>#</b>.

       <b>-CC</b> Do  not  discard  comments,  including during macro expansion.  This is like <b>-C</b>, except that comments
           contained within macros are also passed through to the output file where the macro is expanded.

           In addition to the side effects of the <b>-C</b> option, the <b>-CC</b> option causes all C++-style comments inside
           a macro to be converted to C-style comments.  This is  to  prevent  later  use  of  that  macro  from
           inadvertently commenting out the remainder of the source line.

           The <b>-CC</b> option is generally used to support lint comments.

       <b>-P</b>  Inhibit  generation  of  linemarkers  in the output from the preprocessor.  This might be useful when
           running the preprocessor on something that is not C code, and will be sent to a program  which  might
           be confused by the linemarkers.

       <b>-traditional</b>
       <b>-traditional-cpp</b>
           Try to imitate the behavior of pre-standard C preprocessors, as opposed to ISO C preprocessors.

           Note  that GCC does not otherwise attempt to emulate a pre-standard C compiler, and these options are
           only supported with the <b>-E</b> switch, or when invoking CPP explicitly.

       <b>-trigraphs</b>
           Support ISO C trigraphs.  These are three-character sequences, all starting with <b>??</b>, that are defined
           by ISO C to stand for single characters.  For example, <b>??/</b> stands for <b>\</b>, so  <b>'??/n'</b>  is  a  character
           constant for a newline.

           By  default,  GCC ignores trigraphs, but in standard-conforming modes it converts them.  See the <b>-std</b>
           and <b>-ansi</b> options.

       <b>-remap</b>
           Enable special code to work around file systems which only permit very short file names, such as  MS-
           DOS.

       <b>-H</b>  Print  the  name  of  each  header  file  used, in addition to other normal activities.  Each name is
           indented to show how deep in the <b>#include</b> stack it is.  Precompiled header files  are  also  printed,
           even  if  they are found to be invalid; an invalid precompiled header file is printed with <b>...x</b> and a
           valid one with <b>...!</b> .

       <b>-d</b><u>letters</u>
           Says to make debugging dumps during compilation as specified by <u>letters</u>.  The flags  documented  here
           are  those  relevant  to  the preprocessor.  Other <u>letters</u> are interpreted by the compiler proper, or
           reserved for future versions of GCC, and so are silently  ignored.   If  you  specify  <u>letters</u>  whose
           behavior conflicts, the result is undefined.

           <b>-dM</b> Instead  of  the  normal output, generate a list of <b>#define</b> directives for all the macros defined
               during the execution of the preprocessor, including predefined macros.  This gives you a  way  of
               finding  out  what  is predefined in your version of the preprocessor.  Assuming you have no file
               <u>foo.h</u>, the command

                       touch foo.h; cpp -dM foo.h

               shows all the predefined macros.

           <b>-dD</b> Like <b>-dM</b> except in two respects: it does <u>not</u> include the predefined macros, and it  outputs  <u>both</u>
               the  <b>#define</b> directives and the result of preprocessing.  Both kinds of output go to the standard
               output file.

           <b>-dN</b> Like <b>-dD</b>, but emit only the macro names, not their expansions.

           <b>-dI</b> Output <b>#include</b> directives in addition to the result of preprocessing.

           <b>-dU</b> Like <b>-dD</b> except  that  only  macros  that  are  expanded,  or  whose  definedness  is  tested  in
               preprocessor  directives,  are  output; the output is delayed until the use or test of the macro;
               and <b>#undef</b> directives are also output for macros tested but undefined at the time.

       <b>-fdebug-cpp</b>
           This option is only useful for debugging GCC.  When used from CPP or  with  <b>-E</b>,  it  dumps  debugging
           information  about  location  maps.  Every token in the output is preceded by the dump of the map its
           location belongs to.

           When used from GCC without <b>-E</b>, this option has no effect.

       <b>-I</b> <u>dir</u>
       <b>-iquote</b> <u>dir</u>
       <b>-isystem</b> <u>dir</u>
       <b>-idirafter</b> <u>dir</u>
           Add the  directory  <u>dir</u>  to  the  list  of  directories  to  be  searched  for  header  files  during
           preprocessing.

           If  <u>dir</u>  begins  with  <b>=</b>  or  $SYSROOT, then the <b>=</b> or $SYSROOT is replaced by the sysroot prefix; see
           <b>--sysroot</b> and <b>-isysroot</b>.

           Directories specified with <b>-iquote</b> apply only to the quote form of the directive,  "#include "<u>file</u>"".
           Directories specified with <b>-I</b>, <b>-isystem</b>, or <b>-idirafter</b> apply to lookup for both the "#include "<u>file</u>""
           and "#include &lt;<u>file</u>&gt;" directives.

           You  can  specify any number or combination of these options on the command line to search for header
           files in several directories.  The lookup order is as follows:

           1.  For the quote form of the include directive, the directory of the current file is searched first.

           2.  For the quote form of the include directive, the directories specified  by  <b>-iquote</b>  options  are
               searched in left-to-right order, as they appear on the command line.

           3.  Directories specified with <b>-I</b> options are scanned in left-to-right order.

           4.  Directories specified with <b>-isystem</b> options are scanned in left-to-right order.

           5.  Standard system directories are scanned.

           6.  Directories specified with <b>-idirafter</b> options are scanned in left-to-right order.

           You  can  use  <b>-I</b>  to  override  a  system  header  file,  substituting your own version, since these
           directories are searched before the standard system header file directories.  However, you should not
           use this option to add directories that contain vendor-supplied system header files; use <b>-isystem</b> for
           that.

           The <b>-isystem</b> and <b>-idirafter</b> options also mark the directory as a system directory, so  that  it  gets
           the same special treatment that is applied to the standard system directories.

           If  a  standard  system  include directory, or a directory specified with <b>-isystem</b>, is also specified
           with <b>-I</b>, the <b>-I</b> option is ignored.  The directory is still searched but as a system directory at  its
           normal  position  in  the  system include chain.  This is to ensure that GCC's procedure to fix buggy
           system headers and the ordering for the "#include_next" directive are not inadvertently changed.   If
           you  really need to change the search order for system directories, use the <b>-nostdinc</b> and/or <b>-isystem</b>
           options.

       <b>-I-</b> Split the include path.  This option  has  been  deprecated.   Please  use  <b>-iquote</b>  instead  for  <b>-I</b>
           directories before the <b>-I-</b> and remove the <b>-I-</b> option.

           Any  directories  specified  with  <b>-I</b> options before <b>-I-</b> are searched only for headers requested with
           "#include "<u>file</u>""; they are not  searched  for  "#include &lt;<u>file</u>&gt;".   If  additional  directories  are
           specified with <b>-I</b> options after the <b>-I-</b>, those directories are searched for all <b>#include</b> directives.

           In  addition, <b>-I-</b> inhibits the use of the directory of the current file directory as the first search
           directory for "#include "<u>file</u>"".  There is no way to override this effect of <b>-I-</b>.

       <b>-iprefix</b> <u>prefix</u>
           Specify <u>prefix</u> as the prefix for  subsequent  <b>-iwithprefix</b>  options.   If  the  prefix  represents  a
           directory, you should include the final <b>/</b>.

       <b>-iwithprefix</b> <u>dir</u>
       <b>-iwithprefixbefore</b> <u>dir</u>
           Append  <u>dir</u>  to the prefix specified previously with <b>-iprefix</b>, and add the resulting directory to the
           include search path.  <b>-iwithprefixbefore</b> puts it in the same place <b>-I</b>  would;  <b>-iwithprefix</b>  puts  it
           where <b>-idirafter</b> would.

       <b>-isysroot</b> <u>dir</u>
           This  option  is  like  the  <b>--sysroot</b>  option,  but  applies only to header files (except for Darwin
           targets, where it applies to both header files and libraries).  See the  <b>--sysroot</b>  option  for  more
           information.

       <b>-imultilib</b> <u>dir</u>
           Use <u>dir</u> as a subdirectory of the directory containing target-specific C++ headers.

       <b>-nostdinc</b>
           Do  not  search  the  standard  system directories for header files.  Only the directories explicitly
           specified with <b>-I</b>, <b>-iquote</b>, <b>-isystem</b>, and/or <b>-idirafter</b> options (and the  directory  of  the  current
           file, if appropriate) are searched.

       <b>-nostdinc++</b>
           Do  not  search  for  header  files in the C++-specific standard directories, but do still search the
           other standard directories.  (This option is used when building the C++ library.)

       <b>-Wcomment</b>
       <b>-Wcomments</b>
           Warn whenever a comment-start sequence <b>/*</b> appears in a <b>/*</b> comment, or  whenever  a  backslash-newline
           appears in a <b>//</b> comment.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wtrigraphs</b>
           Warn if any trigraphs are encountered that might change the meaning of the program.  Trigraphs within
           comments are not warned about, except those that would form escaped newlines.

           This  option  is  implied  by  <b>-Wall</b>.   If  <b>-Wall</b>  is  not given, this option is still enabled unless
           trigraphs are enabled.  To get  trigraph  conversion  without  warnings,  but  get  the  other  <b>-Wall</b>
           warnings, use <b>-trigraphs</b> <b>-Wall</b> <b>-Wno-trigraphs</b>.

       <b>-Wundef</b>
           Warn  if  an  undefined identifier is evaluated in an "#if" directive.  Such identifiers are replaced
           with zero.

       <b>-Wexpansion-to-defined</b>
           Warn whenever <b>defined</b> is encountered in the expansion of a macro (including the case where the  macro
           is  expanded  by  an  <b>#if</b>  directive).   Such usage is not portable.  This warning is also enabled by
           <b>-Wpedantic</b> and <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-Wunused-macros</b>
           Warn about macros defined in the main file that are unused.  A macro is <u>used</u> if  it  is  expanded  or
           tested  for  existence  at least once.  The preprocessor also warns if the macro has not been used at
           the time it is redefined or undefined.

           Built-in macros, macros defined on the command line, and macros defined  in  include  files  are  not
           warned about.

           <u>Note:</u> If a macro is actually used, but only used in skipped conditional blocks, then the preprocessor
           reports  it  as  unused.   To  avoid  the  warning in such a case, you might improve the scope of the
           macro's definition by, for example, moving it into the first skipped block.  Alternatively, you could
           provide a dummy use with something like:

                   #if defined the_macro_causing_the_warning
                   #endif

       <b>-Wno-endif-labels</b>
           Do not warn whenever an "#else" or an "#endif" are followed by text.  This sometimes happens in older
           programs with code of the form

                   #if FOO
                   ...
                   #else FOO
                   ...
                   #endif FOO

           The second and third "FOO" should be in comments.  This warning is on by default.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       This section describes the environment variables that affect how CPP  operates.   You  can  use  them  to
       specify directories or prefixes to use when searching for include files, or to control dependency output.

       Note  that  you can also specify places to search using options such as <b>-I</b>, and control dependency output
       with options like <b>-M</b>.  These take precedence over environment variables, which in  turn  take  precedence
       over the configuration of GCC.

       <b>CPATH</b>
       <b>C_INCLUDE_PATH</b>
       <b>CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH</b>
       <b>OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH</b>
           Each  variable's  value is a list of directories separated by a special character, much like <b>PATH</b>, in
           which to look for header files.  The special character,  "PATH_SEPARATOR",  is  target-dependent  and
           determined  at GCC build time.  For Microsoft Windows-based targets it is a semicolon, and for almost
           all other targets it is a colon.

           <b>CPATH</b> specifies a list of directories to be searched as if specified with <b>-I</b>,  but  after  any  paths
           given  with  <b>-I</b>  options  on the command line.  This environment variable is used regardless of which
           language is being preprocessed.

           The remaining environment variables apply only when preprocessing the particular language  indicated.
           Each  specifies  a  list  of  directories to be searched as if specified with <b>-isystem</b>, but after any
           paths given with <b>-isystem</b> options on the command line.

           In all these variables, an empty element  instructs  the  compiler  to  search  its  current  working
           directory.   Empty elements can appear at the beginning or end of a path.  For instance, if the value
           of <b>CPATH</b> is ":/special/include", that has the same effect as <b>-I.</b> <b>-I/special/include</b>.

       <b>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</b>
           If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output dependencies for Make based  on  the  non-
           system  header  files  processed  by the compiler.  System header files are ignored in the dependency
           output.

           The value of <b>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</b> can be just a file name, in which case the Make rules are written to
           that file, guessing the target name from the source file name.  Or the value can have the  form  <u>file</u>
           <u>target</u>, in which case the rules are written to file <u>file</u> using <u>target</u> as the target name.

           In other words, this environment variable is equivalent to combining the options <b>-MM</b> and <b>-MF</b>, with an
           optional <b>-MT</b> switch too.

       <b>SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES</b>
           This variable is the same as <b>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</b> (see above), except that system header files are not
           ignored,  so  it  implies  <b>-M</b>  rather  than  <b>-MM</b>.   However, the dependence on the main input file is
           omitted.

       <b>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</b>
           If this variable is set, its value specifies a UNIX timestamp  to  be  used  in  replacement  of  the
           current date and time in the "__DATE__" and "__TIME__" macros, so that the embedded timestamps become
           reproducible.

           The  value of <b>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</b> must be a UNIX timestamp, defined as the number of seconds (excluding
           leap seconds) since 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 represented in ASCII; identical to the output of "date  +%s"
           on GNU/Linux and other systems that support the %s extension in the "date" command.

           The value should be a known timestamp such as the last modification time of the source or package and
           it should be set by the build process.
