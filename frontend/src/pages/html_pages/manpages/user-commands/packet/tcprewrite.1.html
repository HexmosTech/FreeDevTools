</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tcprewrite</b> - Rewrite the packets in a pcap file.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tcprewrite</b> [<b>-flags</b>] [<b>-flag</b> [<u>value</u>]] [<b>--option-name</b>[[=| ]<u>value</u>]]

       All arguments must be options.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Tcprewrite  is  a tool to rewrite packets stored in <u><a href="../man3/pcap.3.html">pcap</a>(3)</u> file format, such as created by tools such as
       <u><a href="../man1/tcpdump.1.html">tcpdump</a>(1)</u> and <u><a href="../man1/wireshark.1.html">wireshark</a>(1)</u>.  Once a pcap file has had it's packets rewritten, they can be replayed  back
       out on the network using <u><a href="../man1/tcpreplay.1.html">tcpreplay</a>(1)</u>.

       tcprewrite currently supports reading the following DLT types:

       <b>DLT_C_HDLC</b> aka Cisco HDLC

       <b>DLT_EN10MB</b> aka Ethernet

       <b>DLT_LINUX_SLL</b> aka Linux Cooked Socket

       <b>DLT_LINUX_SLL2</b> aka Linux Cooked Socket v2

       <b>DLT_RAW</b> aka RAW IP

       <b>DLT_NULL</b> aka BSD Loopback

       <b>DLT_LOOP</b> aka OpenBSD Loopback

       <b>DLT_IEEE802_11</b> aka 802.11a/b/g

       <b>DLT_IEEE802_11_RADIO</b> aka 802.11a/b/g with Radiotap headers

       <b>DLT_JUNIPER_ETHER</b> aka Juniper Encapsulated Ethernet

       <b>DLT_PPP_SERIAL</b> aka PPP over Serial

       Please see the --dlt option for supported DLT types for writing.

       The  packet  editing  features  of  tcprewrite  which  distinguish  between "client" and "server" traffic
       requires a <a href="../man1/tcpprep.1.html">tcpprep</a>(1) cache file.

       For more details, please see the Tcpreplay Manual at: <a href="http://tcpreplay.appneta.com">http://tcpreplay.appneta.com</a>

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>-r</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--portmap</b>=<u>string</u> Rewrite TCP/UDP ports.  This option may appear up to 9999 times.

       Specify a list of comma delimited port mappings consisting of colon delimited port number pairs.  Each
       colon delimited port pair consists of the port to match followed by the port number to rewrite.

       Examples:
           --portmap=80:8000 --portmap=8080:80    # 80-&gt;8000 and 8080-&gt;80
           --portmap=8000,8080,88888:80           # 3 different ports become 80
           --portmap=8000-8999:80                 # ports 8000 to 8999 become 80

       <b>-s</b> <u>number</u>, <b>--seed</b>=<u>number</u> Randomize src/dst IPv4/v6 addresses w/ given seed.  This option may appear up to
       1 times.  This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options: fuzz-seed.  This
       option takes an integer number as its argument.

       Causes the source and destination IPv4/v6 addresses to be pseudo randomized but still maintain
       client/server relationships.  Since the randomization is deterministic based on the seed, you can reuse
       the same seed value to recreate the traffic.

       <b>-N</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--pnat</b>=<u>string</u> Rewrite IPv4/v6 addresses using pseudo-NAT.  This option may appear up to 2
       times.  This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options: srcipmap.

       Takes a comma delimited series of colon delimited CIDR netblock pairs.  Each netblock pair is evaluated
       in order against the IP addresses.  If the IP address in the packet matches the first netblock, it is
       rewritten using the second netblock as a mask against the high order bits.

       IPv4 Example:
           --pnat=192.168.0.0/16:10.77.0.0/16,172.16.0.0/12:10.1.0.0/24
       IPv6 Example:
           --pnat=[2001:db8::/32]:[dead::/16],[2001:db8::/32]:[::ffff:0:0/96]

       <b>-S</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--srcipmap</b>=<u>string</u> Rewrite source IPv4/v6 addresses using pseudo-NAT.  This option may appear
       up to 1 times.  This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options: pnat.

       Works just like the --pnat option, but only affects the source IP addresses in the IPv4/v6 header.

       <b>-D</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--dstipmap</b>=<u>string</u> Rewrite destination IPv4/v6 addresses using pseudo-NAT.  This option may
       appear up to 1 times.  This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
       pnat.

       Works just like the --pnat option, but only affects the destination IP addresses in the IPv4/v6 header.

       <b>-e</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--endpoints</b>=<u>string</u> Rewrite IP addresses to be between two endpoints.  This option may appear
       up to 1 times.  This option must appear in combination with the following options: cachefile.

       Takes a pair of colon delimited IPv4/v6 addresses which will be used to rewrite all traffic to appear to
       be between the two IP addresses.

       IPv4 Example:
           --endpoints=172.16.0.1:172.16.0.2
       IPv6 Example:
           --endpoints=[2001:db8::dead:beef]:[::ffff:0:0:ac:f:0:2]

       <b>--tcp-sequence</b>=<u>number</u> Change TCP Sequence (and ACK) numbers /w given seed.  This option takes an integer
       number as its argument.  The value of <u>number</u> is constrained to being:
           greater than or equal to 1
       The default <u>number</u> for this option is:
            0

       Change all TCP sequence numbers, and related sequence-acknowledgement numbers.  They will be shifted by a
       random amount based on the provided seed.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--skipbroadcast</b> Skip rewriting broadcast/multicast IPv4/v6 addresses.

       By default --seed, --pnat and --endpoints will rewrite broadcast and multicast IPv4/v6 and MAC
       addresses.     Setting this flag will keep broadcast/multicast IPv4/v6 and MAC addresses from being
       rewritten.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--fixcsum</b> Force recalculation of IPv4/TCP/UDP header checksums.

       Causes each IPv4/v6 packet to have their checksums recalculated and fixed.  Automatically enabled for
       packets modified with <b>--seed</b>, <b>--pnat</b>, <b>--endpoints</b> or <b>--fixlen</b>.

       <b>--fixhdrlen</b> Alter IP/TCP header len to match packet length.

       By default, tcpreplay will send packets with the original packet length, However, you may want the packet
       length revised to minimum packet size.  Using this option, tcpreplay will rewrite (fix) the packet
       length, and recalculate checksums when packet length changes.  Caution: undesired packet changes may
       occur when this option is specified.

       <b>-m</b> <u>number</u>, <b>--mtu</b>=<u>number</u> Override default MTU length (1500 bytes).  This option may appear up to 1 times.
       This option takes an integer number as its argument.  The value of <u>number</u> is constrained to being:
           in the range  1 through MAX_SNAPLEN

       Override the default 1500 byte MTU size for determining the maximum padding length (--fixlen=pad) or when
       truncating (--mtu-trunc).

       <b>--mtu-trunc</b> Truncate packets larger then specified MTU.  This option may appear up to 1 times.

       Similar to --fixlen, this option will truncate data in packets from Layer 3 and above to be no larger
       then the MTU.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--efcs</b> Remove Ethernet checksums (FCS) from end of frames.

       Note, this option is pretty dangerous!  We do not actually check to see if a FCS actually exists in the
       frame, we just blindly delete the last 4 bytes.  Hence, you should only use this if you know know that
       your OS provides the FCS when reading raw packets.

       <b>--ttl</b>=<u>string</u> Modify the IPv4/v6 TTL/Hop Limit.

       Allows you to modify the TTL/Hop Limit of all the IPv4/v6 packets.  Specify a number to hard-code the
       value or +/-value to increase or decrease by the value provided (limited to 1-255).

       Examples:
           --ttl=10
           --ttl=+7
           --ttl=-64

       <b>--tos</b>=<u>number</u> Set the IPv4 TOS/DiffServ/ECN byte.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This option
       takes an integer number as its argument.  The value of <u>number</u> is constrained to being:
           in the range  0 through 255

       Allows you to override the TOS (also known as DiffServ/ECN) value in IPv4.

       <b>--tclass</b>=<u>number</u> Set the IPv6 Traffic Class byte.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This option
       takes an integer number as its argument.  The value of <u>number</u> is constrained to being:
           in the range  0 through 255

       Allows you to override the IPv6 Traffic Class field.

       <b>--flowlabel</b>=<u>number</u> Set the IPv6 Flow Label.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This option takes an
       integer number as its argument.  The value of <u>number</u> is constrained to being:
           in the range  0 through 1048575

       Allows you to override the 20bit IPv6 Flow Label field.  Has no effect on IPv4 packets.

       <b>-F</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--fixlen</b>=<u>string</u> Pad or truncate packet data to match header length.  This option may appear up
       to 1 times.

       Packets may be truncated during capture if the snaplen is smaller then the packet.  This option allows
       you to modify the packet to pad the packet back out to the size stored in the IPv4/v6 header or rewrite
       the IP header total length to reflect the stored packet length.

       <b>pad</b> Truncated packets will be padded out so that the packet length matches the IPv4 total length

       <b>trunc</b> Truncated packets will have their IPv4 total length field rewritten to match the actual packet
       length

       <b>del</b> Delete the packet

       <b>--fuzz-seed</b>=<u>number</u> Fuzz 1 in X packets. Edit bytes, length, or emulate packet drop.  This option takes an
       integer number as its argument.  The value of <u>number</u> is constrained to being:
           greater than or equal to 0
       The default <u>number</u> for this option is:
            0

       This fuzzing was designed as to test layer 7 protocols such as voip protocols.  It modifies randomly 1
       out of X packets (where X = <b>--fuzz-factor</b>) in order for stateful protocols to cover more of their code.
       The random fuzzing actions focus on data start and end because it often is the part of the data
       application protocols base their decisions on.

       Possible fuzzing actions list:
        * drop packet
        * reduce packet size
        * edit packet Bytes:
          * Not all Bytes have the same probability of appearance in real life.
            Replace with 0x00, 0xFF, or a random byte with equal likelihood.
          * Not all Bytes have the same significance in a packet.
            Replace the start, the end, or the middle of the packet with equal likelihood.
        * do nothing (7 out of 8 packets)

       <b>--fuzz-factor</b>=<u>number</u> Set the Fuzz 1 in X packet ratio (default 1 in 8 packets).  This option must appear
       in combination with the following options: fuzz-seed.  This option takes an integer number as its
       argument.  The value of <u>number</u> is constrained to being:
           greater than or equal to 1
       The default <u>number</u> for this option is:
            8

       Sets the ratio of for <b>--fuzz-seed</b> option. By default this value is 8, which means 1 in 8 packets are
       modified by fuzzing. Note that this ratio is based on the random number generated by the supplied fuzz
       seed. Therefore by default you cannot expect that exactly every eighth packet will be modified.

       <b>--skipl2broadcast</b> Skip rewriting broadcast/multicast Layer 2 addresses.

       By default, editing Layer 2 addresses will rewrite broadcast and multicast MAC addresses.  Setting this
       flag will keep broadcast/multicast MAC addresses from being rewritten.

       <b>--dlt</b>=<u>string</u> Override output DLT encapsulation.  This option may appear up to 1 times.

       By default, no DLT (data link type) conversion will be made.  To change the DLT type of the output pcap,
       select one of the following values:

       <b>enet</b> Ethernet aka DLT_EN10MB

       <b>hdlc</b> Cisco HDLC aka DLT_C_HDLC

       <b>jnpr_eth</b> Juniper Ethernet DLT_C_JNPR_ETHER

       <b>pppserial</b> PPP Serial aka DLT_PPP_SERIAL

       <b>user</b> User specified Layer 2 header and DLT type

       <b>--enet-dmac</b>=<u>string</u> Override destination ethernet MAC addresses.  This option may appear up to 1 times.

       Takes a pair of comma deliminated ethernet MAC addresses which will replace the destination MAC address
       of outbound packets.  The first MAC address will be used for the server to client traffic and the
       optional second MAC address will be used for the client to server traffic.

       Example:
           --enet-dmac=00:12:13:14:15:16,00:22:33:44:55:66

       <b>--enet-smac</b>=<u>string</u> Override source ethernet MAC addresses.  This option may appear up to 1 times.

       Takes a pair of comma deliminated ethernet MAC addresses which will replace the source MAC address of
       outbound packets.  The first MAC address will be used for the server to client traffic and the optional
       second MAC address will be used for the client to server traffic.

       Example:
           --enet-smac=00:12:13:14:15:16,00:22:33:44:55:66

       <b>--enet-subsmac</b>=<u>string</u> Substitute MAC addresses.  This option may appear up to 9999 times.

       Allows you to rewrite ethernet MAC addresses of packets. It takes comma delimited pair or MACs address
       and rewrites all occurrences of the first MAC with the value of the second MAC.  Example:
           --enet-subsmac=00:12:13:14:15:16,00:22:33:44:55:66

       <b>--enet-mac-seed</b>=<u>number</u> Randomize MAC addresses.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This option must
       not appear in combination with any of the following options: enet-smac, enet-dmac, enet-subsmac.  This
       option takes an integer number as its argument.

       Allows you to randomize ethernet MAC addresses of packets, mostly like what <b>--seed</b> option does for
       IPv4/IPv6 addresses.

       <b>--enet-mac-seed-keep-bytes</b>=<u>number</u> Randomize MAC addresses.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This
       option must appear in combination with the following options: enet-mac-seed.  This option takes an
       integer number as its argument.  The value of <u>number</u> is constrained to being:
           in the range  1 through 6

       Keep some bytes untouched when usinging <b>--enet-mac-seed</b> option.

       <b>--enet-vlan</b>=<u>string</u> Specify ethernet 802.1q VLAN tag mode.  This option may appear up to 1 times.

       Allows you to rewrite ethernet frames to add a 802.1q header to standard 802.3 ethernet headers or remove
       the 802.1q VLAN tag information.

       <b>add</b> Adds an 802.1q VLAN header to the existing 802.3 ethernet header. If a VLAN header already exists, a
       new VLAN header is added outside of the existing header.

       Note that you will be allowed to run this option multiple times to create more than 2 VLAN headers,
       however those packets will be valid. At most you should have 2 X 802.1q VLAN tags, or outer an 802.1ad
       and an inner 802.1q VLAN tag.

       <b>del</b> Rewrites the existing 802.1q VLAN header as an 802.3 ethernet header

       <b>--enet-vlan-tag</b>=<u>number</u> Specify the new ethernet 802.1q VLAN tag value.  This option may appear up to 1
       times.  This option must appear in combination with the following options: enet-vlan.  This option takes
       an integer number as its argument.  The value of <u>number</u> is constrained to being:
           in the range  0 through 4095

       <b>--enet-vlan-cfi</b>=<u>number</u> Specify the ethernet 802.1q VLAN CFI value.  This option may appear up to 1 times.
       This option must appear in combination with the following options: enet-vlan.  This option takes an
       integer number as its argument.  The value of <u>number</u> is constrained to being:
           in the range  0 through 1

           in the range  0 through 7

       <b>--enet-vlan-proto</b>=<u>string</u> Specify VLAN tag protocol 802.1q or 802.1ad.  This option may appear up to 1
       times.

       Allows you to specify the protocol of the added VLAN tags.

       <b>802.1q</b> Specifies that 802.1q VLAN headers are to be added. This is the default.

       <b>802.1ad</b> Specifies that 802.1ad Q-in-Q VLAN headers are to be added. To make valid packets, input packets
       must already have 802.1q VLAN headers.

       <b>--hdlc-control</b>=<u>number</u> Specify HDLC control value.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This option
       takes an integer number as its argument.

       The Cisco HDLC header has a 1 byte "control" field.  Apparently this should always be 0, but if you can
       use any 1 byte value.

       <b>--hdlc-address</b>=<u>number</u> Specify HDLC address.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This option takes an
       integer number as its argument.

       The Cisco HDLC header has a 1 byte "address" field which has two valid values:

       <b>0x0F</b> Unicast

       <b>0xBF</b> Broadcast
       You can however specify any single byte value.

       <b>--user-dlt</b>=<u>number</u> Set output file DLT type.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This option takes an

       <b>--user-dlink</b>=<u>string</u> Rewrite Data-Link layer with user specified data.  This option may appear up to 2
       times.

       Provide a series of comma deliminated hex values which will be used to rewrite or create the Layer 2
       header of the packets.  The first instance of this argument will rewrite both server and client traffic,
       but if this argument is specified a second time, it will be used for the client traffic.

       Example:
           --user-dlink=01,02,03,04,05,06,00,1A,2B,3C,4D,5E,6F,08,00

       <b>-d</b> <u>number</u>, <b>--dbug</b>=<u>number</u> Enable debugging output.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This option
       takes an integer number as its argument.  The value of <u>number</u> is constrained to being:
           in the range  0 through 5
       The default <u>number</u> for this option is:
            0

       If configured with --enable-debug, then you can specify a verbosity level for debugging output.  Higher
       numbers increase verbosity.

       <b>-i</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--infile</b>=<u>string</u> Input pcap file to be processed.  This option may appear up to 1 times.

       <b>-o</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--outfile</b>=<u>string</u> Output pcap file.  This option may appear up to 1 times.

       <b>-c</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--cachefile</b>=<u>string</u> Split traffic via tcpprep cache file.  This option may appear up to 1
       times.

       Use tcpprep cache file to split traffic based upon client/server relationships.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b> Print decoded packets via tcpdump to STDOUT.  This option may appear up to 1 times.

       <b>-A</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--decode</b>=<u>string</u> Arguments passed to tcpdump decoder.  This option may appear up to 1 times.
       This option must appear in combination with the following options: verbose.

       When enabling verbose mode (<b>-v</b>) you may also specify one or more additional arguments to pass to <b>tcpdump</b>
       to modify the way packets are decoded.  By default, -n and -l are used.  Be sure to quote the arguments
       so that they are not interpreted by tcprewrite.   Please see the <a href="../man1/tcpdump.1.html">tcpdump</a>(1) man page for a complete list
       of options.

       <b>--fragroute</b>=<u>string</u> Parse fragroute configuration file.  This option may appear up to 1 times.

       Enable advanced evasion techniques using the built-in <a href="../man8/fragroute.8.html">fragroute</a>(8) engine.  See the <a href="../man8/fragroute.8.html">fragroute</a>(8) man page
       for more details.  Important: tcprewrite does not support the delay, echo or print commands.

       <b>--fragdir</b>=<u>string</u> Which flows to apply fragroute to: c2s, s2c, both.  This option may appear up to 1
       times.  This option must appear in combination with the following options: cachefile.

       Apply the fragroute engine to packets going c2s, s2c or both when using a cache file.

       <b>--skip-soft-errors</b> Skip writing packets with soft errors.  This option may appear up to 1 times.

       In some cases, packets can not be decoded or the requested editing is not possible.  Normally these
       packets are written to the output file unedited so that tcpprep cache files can still be used, but if you
       wish, these packets can be suppressed.

       One example of this is 802.11 management frames which contain no data.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b> Print version information.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--less-help</b> Display less usage information and exit.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--suppress-warnings</b> suppress printing warning messages.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--help</b> Display usage information and exit.

       <b>-!</b>, <b>--more-help</b> Pass the extended usage information through a pager.

       <b>--save-opts</b> [=<u>cfgfile</u>] Save the option state to <u>cfgfile</u>.  The default is the <u>last</u> configuration file

       <b>--load-opts</b>=<u>cfgfile</u>, <b>--no-load-opts</b> Load options from <u>cfgfile</u>.  The <u>no-load-opts</u> form will disable the
       loading of earlier config/rc/ini files.  <u>--no-load-opts</u> is handled early, out of order.

       <b>OPTION</b> <b>PRESETS</b>
              Any option that  is  not  marked  as  <u>not</u>  <u>presettable</u>  may  be  preset  by  loading  values  from
              configuration ("RC" or ".INI") file(s).  The <u>homerc</u> file is "<u>$$/</u>", unless that is a directory.  In
              that case, the file "<u>.tcprewriterc</u>" is searched for within that directory.
