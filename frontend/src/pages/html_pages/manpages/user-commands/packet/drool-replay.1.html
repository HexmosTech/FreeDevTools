</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       drool - DNS Replay Tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>drool</b> <b>replay</b> [ <u>options</u> ] <b>file</b> <b>host</b> <b>port</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>drool</b>  can  replay  DNS  traffic from packet capture (PCAP) files and send it to a specified server, with
       options such as to manipulate the timing between packets, as well as loop packets infinitely or for a set
       number of iterations.  This tool's goal is to be able to produce a high amount of UDP packets per  second
       and TCP sessions per second on common hardware.

       The purpose can be to simulate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on the DNS and measure normal
       DNS  querying.  For example, the tool could enable you to take a snapshot of a DDoS and be able to replay
       it later to test if new code or hardening techniques are useful, safe &amp; effective.  Another example is to
       be able to replay a packet stream for a bug that is sequence- and/or timing-related in order to  validate
       the efficacy of subsequent bug fixes.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These options are specific for the <b>replay</b> command, see <u><a href="../man1/drool.1.html">drool</a></u>(1) for generic options.

       <b>-D</b>     Show DNS queries and responses as processing goes.

       <b>-n</b> <b>--no-responses</b>
              Do not wait for responses before sending next request.

       <b>--no-tcp</b>
              Do not use TCP.

       <b>--no-udp</b>
              Do not use UDP.

       <b>-T</b> <b>--threads</b>
              Use threads.

       <b>--tcp-threads</b> <b>N</b>
              Set the number of TCP threads to use, default 2.

       <b>--udp-threads</b> <b>N</b>
              Set the number of UDP threads to use, default 4.

       <b>--timeout</b> <b>N.N</b>
              Set timeout for waiting on responses [seconds.nanoseconds], default 10.0.

       <b>-t</b> <b>--timing</b> <b>mode[=option]</b>
              Set the timing mode, see TIMING MODES.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>drool</b> <b>replay</b> <b>--timing</b> <b>multiply=0.5</b> <b>--no-tcp</b> <b>file.pcap</b> <b>127.0.0.1</b> <b>53</b>

              Send all DNS queries twice as fast as found in the PCAP file to localhost using UDP.

       <b>drool</b> <b>replay</b> <b>--timing</b> <b>keep</b> <b>--no-udp</b> <b>file.pcap</b> <b>127.0.0.1</b> <b>53</b>

              Send all DNS queries over TCP to localhost as they were recorded.

       <b>drool</b> <b>replay</b> <b>--no-tcp</b> <b>--no-responses</b> <b>--threads</b> <b>--udp-threads</b> <b>3</b> <b>file.pcap</b> <b>127.0.0.1</b> <b>53</b>

              Take  all  DNS  queries  found  in  the  PCAP  file  and send them as fast as possible over UDP to
              localhost by ignoring both timings, replies and starting 3 threads that will  simultaneously  send
              queries.

</pre><h4><b>TIMING</b> <b>MODES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ignore</b> Set the timing mode to ignore all timings and try to send traffic as fast as possible (default).

       <b>keep</b>   Set the timing mode to try and keep up with interval between the traffic received.

       <b>add=&lt;nanoseconds&gt;</b>
              Set the timing mode to add the given nanoseconds to the interval between the traffic received.

       <b>reduce=&lt;nanoseconds&gt;</b>
              Set  the  timing  mode  to  reduce  the  interval  between  the  traffic  received  with the given
              nanoseconds.

       <b>multiply=&lt;float&gt;</b>
              Set the timing mode to multiply the interval between the traffic received, this can be thought  as
              percent with 1.00 being 100% of the interval, 2.00 being 200%, 0.10 being 10% and so on.

       <b>fixed=&lt;nanoseconds&gt;</b>
              Set the timing between packets to the given nanoseconds.
