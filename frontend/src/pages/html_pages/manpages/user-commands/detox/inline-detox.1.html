</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       inline-detox — clean up filenames (stream-based)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>inline-detox</b> [<b>-hnLrv</b>] [<b>-s</b> <u>sequence</u>] [<b>-f</b> <u>configfile</u>] <u>file</u> <u>...</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>inline-detox</b> utility can remove spaces and other such annoyances from streams.  It'll also translate
       or cleanup Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1) characters encoded in 8-bit ASCII, Unicode characters encoded  in  UTF-8,
       and CGI escaped characters.  Basically it's detox, but does not operate on files.

   <b>Sequences</b>
       <b>inline-detox</b>  is driven by a configurable series of filters, called a sequence.  Sequences are covered in
       more detail in <u><a href="../man5/detoxrc.5.html">detoxrc</a></u>(5) and are discoverable with the <b>-L</b> option.  Some examples  of  default  sequences
       are <b>iso8859_1</b> and <b>utf_8</b>.

   <b>Options</b>
       The main options:

       <b>-f</b> <u>configfile</u>
                   Use  <u>configfile</u> instead of the default configuration files for loading translation sequences.
                   No other config file will be parsed.

       <b>-h</b> <b>--help</b>   Display helpful information.

       <b>-L</b>          List the currently available sequences.  When paired with <b>-v</b> this option shows  what  filters
                   are used in each sequence and any properties applied to the filters.

       <b>-r</b>          Recurse into subdirectories.

       <b>-s</b> <u>sequence</u>
                   Use <u>sequence</u> instead of default.

       <b>-v</b>          Be verbose about which files are being renamed.

       <b>-V</b>          Show the current version of <b>inline-detox</b>.

   <b>Deprecated</b> <b>Options</b>
       Deprecated  Options  are  options  that  were available in earlier versions of <b>inline-detox</b> but have lost
       their meaning and are being phased out.

       <b>--remove-trailing</b>
                   Removes _ and - after .'s in filenames.  This  was  first  provided  in  the  0.9  series  of
                   <b>inline-detox</b>.   After  the  introduction  of sequences, it lost its meaning, as you could now
                   determine the properties  of  wipeup  through  a  particular  sequence's  configuration.   It
                   presently  forces  all  instances  of the wipeup filter to use remove trailing, regardless of
                   what's actually in the config files.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>detoxrc</u>        The system-wide detoxrc file.
       <u><a href="file:~/.detoxrc">~/.detoxrc</a></u>     A user's personal detoxrc.  Normally it extends the system-wide  detoxrc,  unless  <b>-f</b>  has
                      been specified, in which case, it is ignored.
       <u>iso8859_1.tbl</u>  The default ISO 8859-1 translation table.
       <u>unicode.tbl</u>    The default Unicode (UTF-8) translation table.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       echo Foo Bar | <b>inline-detox</b> <b>-s</b> <u>iso8859_1</u> <b>-v</b>
                   Will run the sequence <u>iso8859_1</u> listing any changes and returning the result to STDOUT.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       detox  was  originally designed to clean up files that I had received from friends which had been created
       using other operating systems.  It's trivial to create a filename with spaces, parenthesis, brackets, and
       ampersands under some operating systems.  These have special meaning within FreeBSD and Linux, and  cause
       problems when you go to access them.  I created <b>inline-detox</b> to clean up these files.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>inline-detox</b> was written by Doug Harple.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Long options don't work under Solaris or Darwin.

       An  error  in  the config file will cause a segfault as it's going to print the offending word within the
       config file.
