       hpavkey - HomePlug AV Key Generator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hpavkey</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>phrase</u> [<u>phrase</u>] [...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Convert  one  or more phrases to encrypted <b>HomePlug</b> <b>AV</b> keys.  Phrases are read as command line arguments,
       converted to either Device Access Keys, Network  Membership  Keys  or  Network  Identification  Keys  and
       printed on stdout.  By default, only keys are printed, one key per line, but keys and phrases can both be
       printed, one pair per line.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the <b>AMP</b> man page for an overview and
       installation instructions.

</pre><h4><b>BACKGROUND</b></h4><pre>
       HomePlug  AV  technology  makes use of special 16-byte binary values, called "keys", for various purposes
       such as identity and security.  Three keys of interest to users are the  Device  Access  Key  (DAK),  the
       Network  Memership  Key  (NMK)  and  Network Identification Key (NID).  Their purpose is described in the
       HomePlug AV Specification.

       The HomePlug AV Specification explains how to generate 16-byte binary DAK, NMK and NID values  using  the
       SHA-256  algorithm  to  hash  user-supplied  ASCII  strings,  called "pass phrases" in the specification.
       HomePlug AV compliant pass phrases have from 12 to 64 7-bit ASCII character values in the range  0x20  to
       0x7F.   In  some  cases, a specified 8-byte salt is added to the pass phrase before computing the 32-byte
       hash value.  In all cases, the computed hash is then rehashed a specified number of times to produce  the
       final 32-byte value.  The HomePlug AV key is the lower 16-bytes of that value.

       Keys  can  be  any  16-byte  binary  value  but  binary  values  are  difficult to remember.  HomePlug AV
       applications, such as the Qualcomm Atheros Windows Device Manager, will ask users for a pass phrase  that
       is  converted  to  a  16-byte binary value using a known hashing algorithm.  In principle, no two phrases
       will product the same key and it would be computationally expensive to derive the pass phrase  given  the
       key.  Although HomePlug AV software deals directly with the key, users need only remember the pass phrase
       in order to reproduce the key.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -<b>D</b>     Uses  HomePlug  AV  rules  to compute Device Access Keys (DAK) from pass phrases read from file or
              stdin.  A DAK is 16 bytes expressed as 32 hexadecimal digits.  This option over-rides any  <b>-M</b>  and
              <b>-N</b> options previously specified on the command line.

       -<b>e</b>     Enforce  HomePlug AV length and content rules for phrases.  Non-compliant phrases are reported and
              ignored.  Compliant phrases are 12 to 64 7-bit ASCII characters in the  range  0x20  (SP)  through
              0x7F  (DEL).   Essentially,  this  includes any character that can be typed on a standard US or UK
              keyboard, excluding horizontal tab (HT).  Be aware that some command shells intercept and  act  on
              special  characters  instead  of  passing them to the application.  In such cases, you may need to
              include meta characters.

       -<b>L</b> <u>level</u>
              Set security level.  The security level is encoded into  the  NID.   Level  <b>0</b>  enables  pushbutton
              pairing.  Level <b>1</b> disables it.  This option has no effect unless a NID is computed.

       -<b>M</b>     Uses  HomePlug  AV rules to compute Network Membership Keys (NMK) from pass phrases read from file
              or stdin.  An NMK is 16 bytes expressed as 32 hexadecimal digits.  This option over-rides  any  <b>-D</b>
              or <b>-N</b> options previously specified on the command line.

       -<b>N</b>     Uses  HomePlug  AV  rules to compute Network Identification Keys (NID) from pass phrases read from
              file or stdin.  A NID is 7 bytes expressed as 14 hexadecimal digits.  This option  over-rides  any
              <b>-D</b> or <b>-M</b> options previously specified on the command line.

       -<b>q</b>     Enable quiet mode which, for this application, has no effect.

       -<b>v</b>     Enable verbose mode which, for this application, prints the pass phrase after each key.

       -<b>?</b>,--<b>help</b>
              Print  program  help  summary  on  stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the
              command line.

       -<b>!</b>,--<b>version</b>
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other  options  on
              the  command line.  Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that
              they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>phrase</b> A pass phrase to be converted to a DAK, NMK or NID.  More than one pass phrase can be  entered  on
              the  command line.  Each phrase will be converted to the same type of key and printed in the order
              specified.  Phrases that contain quotes or special delimiters should  be  enclosed  in  quotes  or
              apostrophes.   By  default,  phrases can be any length and contain any ASCII chracter except ASCII
              NUL.  Use option <b>-e</b> to enforce HomePlug AV password character and length rules.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following example prints the ordinary SHA256 key for the phrase,  "HomePlugAV0123",  entered  on  the
       command  line.   An  SHA key is 256 bits or 32 bytes expressed as 64 hexadecimal characters.  SHA256 keys
       are the default output when no key type is specified.  SHA256 is a public domain standard, not a HomePlug
       AV standard.

          # hpavkey HomePlugAV0123
          EA41A2383355FA7CA3B467DF0848A8EB9C41591BE53696C5F45DDAF621784F07

       The following example prints the DAK for the phrase, "HomePlugAV0123", entered on the command line.

          # hpavkey -D HomePlugAV0123
          F084B4E8F6069FF1300C9BDB812367FF

       The following command prints the NMK, instead of the DAK, for the phrase entered  on  the  command  line.
       The ouput is different because the DAK and NMK are computed differently given the same pass phrase.

          # hpavkey -M HomePlugAV0123
          B59319D7E8157BA001B018669CCEE30D

       The following command prints the NMK for each phrase entered on the command line.  Notice that spaces are
       legal and significant.  Phrases containing spaces must be enclosed in quotes.

          # hpavkey -M HomePlugAV0123 "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog."
          B59319D7E8157BA001B018669CCEE30D
          56F3C7F539D4F8F5EEC00E63F11A8DEC

       The  following  command  prints  the NMK and pass phrase for each pass phrase entered on the command line
       because the verbose option is specified.

          # hpavkey -v -M HomePlugAV0123 "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog."
          B59319D7E8157BA001B018669CCEE30D HomePlugAV0123
          56F3C7F539D4F8F5EEC00E63F11A8DEC The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.

       <b>hpavkey</b> can be used to compute a key and pass it to another program as an argument.  The  <b>modpib</b>  command
       shown  below will edit file <b>example.pib</b> by replacing the DAK.  The <b>-D</b> option expects a hexadecimal key so
       we can supply one from the phrase "HomePlugAV0123".

          # modpid -D $(<b>hpavkey</b> <b>-D</b> <b>HomePlugAV0123</b>) example.pib

</pre><h4><b>TIPS&amp;TRICKS</b></h4><pre>
       The following example illustrates an unusual case where the passwords start with dash ("<b>-</b>").  The program
       assumes that the dash is an option prefix which is incorrect in  this  case.   An  error  occurs  because
       option <b>-H</b> is illegal.

          # hpavkey -vM -HomePlugAV -HomePlugAV123
          hpavkey: Operation canceled: Option 'H' has no meaning

       one  solution  is  to insert a double-dash ("<b>--</b>") on the command line to indicate that no further options
       appear on the command line.  We include option <b>-v</b> to display the passwords on output.

          # hpavkey -vM -- -HomePlugAV -HomePlugAV123
          80B74B14E92A739AD41ACDC377451D1B -HomePlugAV
          1A46BDE6F75209292FDFC4CCE4D19B4E -HomePlugAV123

       See the <b>hpavkeys</b> man page for yet another solution to this problem.
