</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       antiword - show the text and images of MS Word documents

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>antiword</b> [ <u>options</u> ] <u>wordfiles</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Antiword</u> is an application that displays the text and the images of Microsoft Word documents.
       A wordfile named - stands for a Word document read from the standard input.
       Only the binary format documents made by MS Word version 2, 6, 7, 97, 2000 and 2003 are supported.  Newer
       Word  versions  default to using a completely different format consisting of XML files in a ZIP container
       (usually with a ".docx" file extension) which antiword doesn't support.   It  also  doesn't  support  the
       "flat" XML format which MS Word 2003 supported.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b> <u>papersize</u>
              Output  in  Adobe  PDF  form. Printable on paper of the specified size: 10x14, a3, a4, a5, b4, b5,
              executive, folio, legal, letter, note, quarto, statement or tabloid.

       <b>-f</b>     Output in formatted text form. That means that bold text is  printed  like  *bold*,  italics  like
              /italics/ and underlined text as _underlined_.

       <b>-h</b>     Give a help message.

       <b>-i</b> <u>image</u> <u>level</u>
              The image level determines how images will be shown.

              0: Use  non-standard  extensions  from  Ghostscript.  This  output may not print on any PostScript
                 printer, but is useful in case no hard copy is needed. It is also useful  when  Ghostscript  is
                 used as a filter to print a PostScript file to a non-PostScript printer.

              1: Show no images.

              2: PostScript level 2 compatible. (default)

              3: PostScript  level  3  compatible. (EXPERIMENTAL, Portable Network Graphics (PNG) images are not
                 printed correctly)

       <b>-m</b> <u>mapping</u> <u>file</u>
              This file is used to map Unicode characters to your local character set.  The default mapping file
              depends on the locale.

       <b>-p</b> <u>papersize</u>
              Output in PostScript form. Printable on paper of the specified size: 10x14, a3, a4,  a5,  b4,  b5,
              executive, folio, legal, letter, note, quarto, statement or tabloid.

       <b>-r</b>     Include text removed by the revisioning system.

       <b>-s</b>     Include text with the so-called "hidden text" attribute.

       <b>-t</b>     Output in text form. (default)

       <b>-w</b> <u>width</u>
              In  text  mode this is the line width in characters. A value of zero puts an entire paragraph on a
              line, useful when the text is to used as input for another wordprocessor. This value is ignored in
              PostScript mode.

       <b>-x</b> <u>document</u> <u>type</u> <u>definition</u>
              Output in XML form. Currently the only document type definition is db (for DocBook).

       <b>-L</b>     In PostScript mode: use landscape mode.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Mapping files like 8859-1.txt
              Antiword looks for its mapping files in three directories, in the order given:
              (1) The directory specified by $ANTIWORDHOME
              (2) The directory specified by $HOME/.antiword
              (3) Directory /usr/share/antiword

       The fontnames file
              Antiword will look for its fontname file in the same directories as used for the mapping files.
              The fontnames file contains the translation table from font names used by MS Word  to  font  names
              used by PostScript.

       NOTE:
              Antiword  cannot  tell the difference between a file that does not exist and a file that cannot be
              opened for reading.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Antiword uses the environment variable ``ANTIWORDHOME'' as the first directory to  look  for  its  files.
       Antiword  uses  the environment variable ``HOME'' to find the user's home directory. When in text mode it
       uses the variable ``COLUMNS'' to set the width of the output (unless overridden by the -w option).

       Antiword uses the environment variables ``LC_ALL'', ``LC_CTYPE'' and ``LANG'' (in that order) to get  the
       current locale and uses this information to select the default mapping file.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Antiword  is  far  from complete. Many features are still missing. Many images are not shown yet. Some of
       the images that are shown, are shown in the wrong place.  PostScript output  is  only  available  in  ISO
       8859-1 and ISO 8859-2.
