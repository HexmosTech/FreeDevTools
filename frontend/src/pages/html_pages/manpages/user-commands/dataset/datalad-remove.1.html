       <b>datalad</b> <b>remove</b> - remove components from datasets

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>datalad</b>          <b>remove</b>         [-h]         [-d         DATASET]         [--drop         {datasets|all}]
              [--reckless  {modification|availability|undead|kill}]  [-m  MESSAGE]  [-J   NJOBS]   [--recursive]
              [--nocheck] [--nosave] [--if-dirty IF_DIRTY] [--version] [PATH ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Removing  "unlinks" a dataset component, such as a file or subdataset, from a dataset. Such a removal ad‐
       vances the state of a dataset, just like adding new content. A remove operation can be undone, by restor‐
       ing a previous dataset state, but might require re-obtaining file content and subdatasets from remote lo‐
       cations.

       This command relies on the 'drop' command for safe operation. By default, only file content from datasets
       which will be uninstalled as part of a removal will be dropped. Otherwise file content is retained,  such
       that  restoring  a previous version also immediately restores file content access, just as it is the case
       for files directly committed to Git. This default behavior can be changed to always  drop  content  prior
       removal, for cases where a minimal storage footprint for local datasets installations is desirable.

       Removing  a  dataset component is always a recursive operation. Removing a directory, removes all content
       underneath the directory too. If subdatasets are located under a to-be-removed path, they will  be  unin‐
       stalled entirely, and all their content dropped. If any subdataset can not be uninstalled safely, the re‐
       move operation will fail and halt.

       Changed in version 0.16
        More in-depth and comprehensive safety-checks are now performed by
        default.
        The ``--if-dirty`` argument is ignored, will be removed in
        a future release, and can be removed for a safe-by-default behavior. For
        other cases consider the ``--reckless`` argument.
        The ``--save`` argument is ignored and will be removed in a future
        release, a dataset modification is now always saved. Consider save's
        ``--amend`` argument for post-remove fix-ups.
        The ``--recursive`` argument is ignored, and will be removed
        in a future release. Removal operations are always recursive, and the
        parameter can be stripped from calls for a safe-by-default behavior.

       Deprecated in version 0.16
        The ``--check`` argument will be removed in a future release.
        It needs to be replaced with ``--reckless``.

   <b>Examples</b>
       Permanently remove a subdataset (and all further subdatasets contained in it) from a dataset::

        % datalad remove -d &lt;path/to/dataset&gt; &lt;path/to/subds&gt;

       Permanently remove a superdataset (with all subdatasets) from the filesystem::

        % datalad remove -d &lt;path/to/dataset&gt;

       DANGER-ZONE: Fast wipe-out a dataset and all its subdataset, bypassing all safety checks::

        % datalad remove -d &lt;path/to/dataset&gt; --reckless kill

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       PATH   path of a dataset or dataset component to be removed. Constraints: value must be a string or value
              must be NONE

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>, <b>--help-np</b>
              show  this  help message. --help-np forcefully disables the use of a pager for displaying the help
              message

       <b>-d</b> DATASET, <b>--dataset</b> DATASET
              specify the dataset to perform remove from. If no dataset is given, the current working  directory
              is  used  as  operation  context.  Constraints: Value must be a Dataset or a valid identifier of a
              Dataset (e.g. a path) or value must be NONE

       <b>--drop</b> {datasets|all}
              which dataset components to drop prior removal. This parameter is passed on to the underlying drop
              operation as its 'what' argument. Constraints: value must be one of ('datasets', 'all')  [Default:
              'datasets']

       <b>--reckless</b> {modification|availability|undead|kill}
              disable  individual  or  all  data  safety  measures that would normally prevent potentially irre‐
              versible data-loss. With 'modification', unsaved modifications in a dataset will not be  detected.
              This improves performance at the cost of permitting potential loss of unsaved or untracked dataset
              components. With 'availability', detection of dataset/branch-states that are only available in the
              local  dataset,  and  detection of an insufficient number of file-content copies will be disabled.
              Especially the latter is a potentially expensive check which might involve numerous network trans‐
              actions. With 'undead', detection of whether a to-be-removed local annex is still known  to  exist
              in  the  network  of  dataset-clones  is disabled. This could cause zombie-records of invalid file
              availability. With 'kill', all safety-checks are disabled.  Constraints:  value  must  be  one  of
              ('modification', 'availability', 'undead', 'kill')

       <b>-m</b> MESSAGE, <b>--message</b> MESSAGE
              a  description  of the state or the changes made to a dataset. Constraints: value must be a string
              or value must be NONE

       <b>-J</b> NJOBS, <b>--jobs</b> NJOBS
              how many parallel jobs (where possible) to use. "auto" corresponds to the number defined by 'data‐
              lad.runtime.max-annex-jobs' configuration item. Constraints: value must  be  convertible  to  type
              'int' or value must be NONE or value must be one of ('auto',)

       <b>--recursive</b>, <b>-r</b>
              DEPRECATED and IGNORED: removal is always a recursive operation.

       <b>--nocheck</b>
              DEPRECATED: use '--reckless availability'.

       <b>--nosave</b>
              DEPRECATED and IGNORED; use `save --amend` instead.

       <b>--if-dirty</b> <u>IF_DIRTY</u>
              DEPRECATED and IGNORED: use --reckless instead.

       <b>--version</b>
              show the module and its version which provides the command
