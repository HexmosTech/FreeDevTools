       h5tovtk - convert datasets in HDF5 files to VTK format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>h5tovtk</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]... [<u>HDF5FILE</u>]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       h5tovtk  is  a program to generate VTK data files from multidimensional datasets in HDF5 files.  VTK, the
       Visualization ToolKit, is an open-source, freely available software  system  for  3D  computer  graphics,
       image processing, and visualization.  VTK itself is a programming library, but it is also the basis for a
       number of end-user graphical visualization programs.

       HDF5  is  a  free,  portable  binary  format  and supporting library developed by the National Center for
       Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign.   A  single  <u>h5</u>  file  can
       contain  multiple  datasets; by default, <u>h5tovtk</u> takes the first dataset, but this can be changed via the
       <b>-d</b> option, or by using the syntax <u>HDF5FILE:DATASET</u>.

       1d/2d/3d datasets are converted into 3d VTK datasets.  Normally, a single scalar VTK dataset  is  output,
       but vectors and fields can be output via the <b>-o</b> option below.

       A  typical invocation is of the form 'h5tovtk foo.h5', which will output a VTK data file foo.vtk from the
       data in foo.h5.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>     Display help on the command-line options and usage.

       <b>-V</b>     Print the version number and copyright info for h5tovtk.

       <b>-v</b>     Verbose output.

       <b>-o</b> <u>file</u>
              Save all the input datasets to a single VTK <u>file</u>.  If there is only one dataset, it is output to a
              VTK scalar dataset; if there are three datasets, they are output as  a  VTK  vector  dataset;  all
              other numbers of datasets are combined into a VTK field dataset.

              Otherwise,  the  default  behavior  is  to  save each dataset to a separate VTK file, with the .h5
              suffix of the input filename replaced by .vtk in the output filename.

              Only three-dimensional datasets may be written to the VTK file.  If you  have  a  four  (or  more)
              dimensional  data  set,  then  you  must take a three-dimensional "slice" of the multi-dimensional
              data.  To do this, you specify coordinates in one (or more)  slice  dimension(s),  via  the  <b>-xyzt</b>
              options.

       <b>-1</b>, <b>-2</b>, <b>-4</b>
              Use  1  ,  2,  or  4  bytes to store each data point in the output file.  Fewer bytes require less
              storage and memory, but will decrease the resolution in the values.  <b>-1</b> will  break  up  the  data
              values into one of 256 possible values (on a linear scale from the minimum to the maximum value in
              your  data),  <b>-2</b>  will allow 65536 possible values, and <b>-4</b> (the default) will use 4-byte floating-
              point numbers for an "exact" representation.

       <b>-a</b>     Output in ASCII format; otherwise, VTK's  more  compact,  but  less  readable  and  somewhat  less
              portable binary format is used.

       <b>-n</b>     For binary output (see <b>-a</b> above), by default the data is written in bigendian byte order, which is
              normally  the  order that VTK expects.  However, some external tools and a few VTK classes use the
              native byte ordering instead (which may not be bigendian), and the <b>-n</b>  option  causes  <u>h5tovtk</u>  to
              output binary data in the native ordering.

       <b>-m</b> <u>min</u>, <b>-M</b> <u>max</u>
              When  <b>-1</b>  or  <b>-2</b>  are used, the input data are converted to a linear integer scale.  Normally, the
              bottom and top of this scale correspond to the minimum and maximum values in the data.  Using  the
              <b>-m</b> and <b>-M</b> options, you can make the bottom and top of the scale correspond to <u>min</u> and <u>max</u> instead,
              respectively.   Data  values  below or above this range will be treated as if they were <u>min</u> or <u>max</u>
              respectively.  See also the <b>-Z</b> option.

       <b>-Z</b>     For <b>-1</b> or <b>-2</b> output, center the linear integer scale on the value zero in the data.

       <b>-r</b>     Invert the output values (map the minimum to the maximum and vice versa).

       <b>-x</b> <u>ix</u>, <b>-y</b> <u>iy</u>, <b>-z</b> <u>iz</u>, <b>-t</b> <u>it</u>
              This tells <u>h5tovtk</u> to use a particular slice of a multi-dimensional dataset.  e.g.   <b>-x</b>  uses  the
              subset  (with one less dimension) at an x index of <u>ix</u> (where the indices run from zero to one less
              than the maximum index in that direction).   Here,  x/y/z  correspond  to  the  first/second/third
              dimensions  of  the HDF5 dataset. The <b>-t</b> option specifies a slice in the last dimension, whichever
              that might be.  See also the <b>-0</b> option to shift the origin of the x/y/z slice coordinates  to  the
              dataset center.

       <b>-0</b>     Shift  the  origin  of the x/y/z slice coordinates to the dataset center, so that e.g. -0 -x 0 (or
              more compactly -0x0) returns the central x plane of the dataset instead of the edge x plane.   (<b>-t</b>
              coordinates are not affected.)

       <b>-d</b> <u>name</u>
              Use  dataset  <u>name</u>  from  the  input  files;  otherwise, the first dataset from each file is used.
              Alternatively, use the syntax <u>HDF5FILE:DATASET</u>, which allows you to specify  a  different  dataset
              for  each  file.   You can use the <u>h5ls</u> command (included with hdf5) to find the names of datasets
              within a file.
