</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>datalad</b> <b>get</b> - get any dataset content (files/directories/subdatasets).

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>datalad</b>   <b>get</b>   [-h]   [-s   LABEL]  [-d  PATH]  [-r]  [-R  LEVELS]  [-n]  [-D  DESCRIPTION]  [--reckless
              [auto|ephemeral|shared-...]] [-J NJOBS] [--version] [PATH ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This command only operates on dataset content. To obtain a new independent dataset from some  source  use
       the CLONE command.

       By default this command operates recursively within a dataset, but not across potential subdatasets, i.e.
       if  a  directory is provided, all files in the directory are obtained. Recursion into subdatasets is sup‐
       ported too. If enabled, relevant subdatasets are detected and installed in order to fulfill a request.

       Known data locations for each requested file are evaluated and data are obtained from some available  lo‐
       cation  (according to git-annex configuration and possibly assigned remote priorities), unless a specific
       source is specified.

   <b>Getting</b> <b>subdatasets</b>
       Just as DataLad supports getting file content from more than one location, the same is supported for sub‐
       datasets, including a ranking of individual sources for prioritization.

       The following location candidates are considered. For each candidate a  cost  is  given  in  parenthesis,
       higher values indicate higher cost, and thus lower priority:

       - A datalad URL recorded in `.gitmodules` (cost 590). This allows for datalad URLs that require addition‐
       al handling/resolution by datalad, like ria-schemes (ria+http, ria+ssh, etc.)

       - A URL or absolute path recorded for git in `.gitmodules` (cost 600).

       -  URL of any configured superdataset remote that is known to have the desired submodule commit, with the
       submodule path appended to it.  There can be more than one candidate (cost 650).

       - In case `.gitmodules` contains a relative path instead of a URL, the URL of any configured superdataset
       remote that is known to have the desired submodule commit, with this relative path appended to it.  There
       can be more than one candidate (cost 650).

       - In case `.gitmodules` contains a relative path as a URL, the absolute path of the superdataset, append‐
       ed with this relative path (cost 900).

       Additional candidate URLs can be generated based on templates specified as configuration  variables  with
       the pattern

       `datalad.get.subdataset-source-candidate-&lt;name&gt;`

       where NAME is an arbitrary identifier. If `name` starts with three digits (e.g. '400myserver') these will
       be  interpreted  as a cost, and the respective candidate will be sorted into the generated candidate list
       according to this cost. If no cost is given, a default of 700 is used.

       A template string assigned to such a variable can utilize the Python format mini language and may  refer‐
       ence  a  number of properties that are inferred from the parent dataset's knowledge about the target sub‐
       dataset. Properties include any submodule property specified in the respective `.gitmodules` record.  For
       convenience, an existing `datalad-id` record is made available under the shortened name ID.

       Additionally, the URL of any configured remote that contains the respective submodule commit is available
       as `remoteurl-&lt;name&gt;` property, where NAME is the configured remote name.

       Hence,    such    a    template    could    be    `<a href="http://example.org/datasets/">http://example.org/datasets/</a>{id}`   or   `<a href="http://exam">http://exam</a>‐
       ple.org/datasets/{path}`, where `{id}` and `{path}` would be replaced by the `datalad-id` or  PATH  entry
       in the `.gitmodules` record.

       If  this  config is committed in `.datalad/config`, a clone of a dataset can look up any subdataset's URL
       according to such scheme(s) irrespective of what URL is recorded in `.gitmodules`.

       Lastly, all candidates are sorted according to their cost (lower values first), and  duplicate  URLs  are
       stripped, while preserving the first item in the candidate list.

       NOTE   Power-user info: This command uses git annex get to fulfill file handles.

   <b>Examples</b>
       Get a single file::

        % datalad get &lt;path/to/file&gt;

       Get contents of a directory::

        % datalad get &lt;path/to/dir/&gt;

       Get all contents of the current dataset and its subdatasets::

        % datalad get . -r

       Get (clone) a registered subdataset, but don't retrieve data::

        % datalad get -n &lt;path/to/subds&gt;

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       PATH   path/name of the requested dataset component. The component must already be known to a dataset. To
              add  new components to a dataset use the ADD command. Constraints: value must be a string or value
              must be NONE

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>, <b>--help-np</b>
              show this help message. --help-np forcefully disables the use of a pager for displaying  the  help
              message

       <b>-s</b> LABEL, <b>--source</b> LABEL
              label of the data source to be used to fulfill requests. This can be the name of a dataset sibling
              or another known source. Constraints: value must be a string or value must be NONE

       <b>-d</b> PATH, <b>--dataset</b> PATH
              specify  the dataset to perform the add operation on, in which case PATH arguments are interpreted
              as being relative to this dataset. If no dataset is given,  an  attempt  is  made  to  identify  a
              dataset  for  each  input  `path`. Constraints: Value must be a Dataset or a valid identifier of a
              Dataset (e.g. a path) or value must be NONE

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--recursive</b>
              if set, recurse into potential subdatasets.

       <b>-R</b> LEVELS, <b>--recursion-limit</b> LEVELS
              limit recursion into subdataset to the given number of levels. Alternatively, 'existing' will lim‐
              it recursion to subdatasets that already existed on the filesystem at the start of processing, and
              prevent new subdatasets from being obtained recursively. Constraints: value must be convertible to
              type 'int' or value must be one of ('existing',) or value must be NONE

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--no-data</b>
              whether to obtain data for all file handles. If disabled, GET operations are  limited  to  dataset
              handles. This option prevents data for file handles from being obtained.

       <b>-D</b> <u>DESCRIPTION</u>, <b>--description</b> <u>DESCRIPTION</u>
              short description to use for a dataset location. Its primary purpose is to help humans to identify
              a dataset copy (e.g., "mike's dataset on lab server"). Note that when a dataset is published, this
              information  becomes  available  on  the remote side. Constraints: value must be a string or value
              must be NONE

       <b>--reckless</b> [auto|ephemeral|shared-...]
              Obtain a dataset or subdatset and set it up in a potentially unsafe way for performance, or access
              reasons. Use with care, any dataset is marked as 'untrusted'. The reckless mode  is  stored  in  a
              dataset's  local configuration under 'datalad.clone.reckless', and will be inherited to any of its
              subdatasets. Supported modes are: ['auto']: hard-link files between local clones. In-place modifi‐
              cation in any clone will alter original annex content. ['ephemeral']: symlink  annex  to  origin's
              annex  and  discard local availability info via git-annex-dead 'here' and declares this annex pri‐
              vate. Shares an annex between origin and clone w/o git-annex being aware  of  it.  In  case  of  a
              change  in origin you need to update the clone before you're able to save new content on your end.
              Alternative to 'auto' when hardlinks are not an option, or number of consumed inodes needs  to  be
              minimized.  Note  that  this mode can only be used with clones from non-bare repositories or a RIA
              store! Otherwise two different annex object tree structures (dirhashmixed vs dirhashlower) will be
              used simultaneously, and annex keys using the respective other  structure  will  be  inaccessible.
              ['shared-&lt;mode&gt;']:  set  up repository and annex permission to enable multi-user access. This dis‐
              ables the standard write protection of annex'ed files. &lt;mode&gt; can be any  value  support  by  'git
              init  --shared=',  such as 'group', or 'all'. Constraints: value must be one of (True, False, 'au‐
              to', 'ephemeral') or value must start with 'shared-'

       <b>-J</b> NJOBS, <b>--jobs</b> NJOBS
              how many parallel jobs (where possible) to use. "auto" corresponds to the number defined by 'data‐
              lad.runtime.max-annex-jobs' configuration item NOTE: This option can only  parallelize  input  re‐
              trieval (get) and output recording (save). DataLad does NOT parallelize your scripts for you. Con‐
              straints:  value  must  be convertible to type 'int' or value must be NONE or value must be one of
              ('auto',) [Default: 'auto']

       <b>--version</b>
              show the module and its version which provides the command
