       <b>datalad</b> <b>status</b> - report on the state of dataset content.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>datalad</b>  <b>status</b> [-h] [-d DATASET] [--annex [{basic|availability|all}]] [--untracked {no|normal|all}] [-r]
              [-R LEVELS] [-e {no|commit|full}] [-t {raw|eval}] [--version] [PATH ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is an analog to `git status` that is simultaneously crippled and more powerful. It is crippled,  be‐
       cause  it only supports a fraction of the functionality of its counter part and only distinguishes a sub‐
       set of the states that Git knows about. But it is also more powerful as it can handle status reports  for
       a whole hierarchy of datasets, with the ability to report on a subset of the content (selection of paths)
       across any number of datasets in the hierarchy.

   <b>Path</b> <b>conventions</b>
       All  reports  are  guaranteed  to  use absolute paths that are underneath the given or detected reference
       dataset, regardless of whether query paths are given as absolute or relative paths (with respect  to  the
       working  directory,  or  to  the  reference dataset, when such a dataset is given explicitly).  Moreover,
       so-called "explicit relative paths" (i.e. paths that start with respect to the current working  directory
       regardless of whether a reference dataset with specified.

       When  it is necessary to address a subdataset record in a superdataset without causing a status query for
       the state _within_ the subdataset itself, this can  be  achieved  by  explicitly  providing  a  reference
       dataset and the path to the root of the subdataset like so::

       datalad status --dataset . subdspath

       In contrast, when the state of the subdataset within the superdataset is not relevant, a status query for
       the  content  of  the  subdataset  can  be obtained by adding a trailing path separator to the query path
       (rsync-like syntax)::

       datalad status --dataset . subdspath/

       When both aspects are relevant (the state of the subdataset content and the state of the subdataset with‐
       in the superdataset), both queries can be combined::

       datalad status --dataset . subdspath subdspath/

       When performing a recursive status query, both status aspects of subdataset are always  included  in  the
       report.

   <b>Content</b> <b>types</b>
       The following content types are distinguished:

       -  'dataset'  --  any  top-level dataset, or any subdataset that is properly registered in superdataset -
       'directory' -- any directory that does not qualify for type 'dataset' - 'file' -- any file, or  any  sym‐
       link  that  is  placeholder  to an annexed file when annex-status reporting is enabled - 'symlink' -- any
       symlink that is not used as a placeholder for an annexed

       <u>file</u>

   <b>Content</b> <b>states</b>
       The following content states are distinguished:

       - 'clean' - 'added' - 'modified' - 'deleted' - 'untracked'

   <b>Examples</b>
       Report on the state of a dataset::

        % datalad status

       Report on the state of a dataset and all subdatasets::

        % datalad status -r

       Address a subdataset record in a superdataset without causing a status query for the state  _within_  the
       subdataset itself::

        % datalad status -d . mysubdataset

       Get  a  status  query  for  the state within the subdataset without causing a status query for the super‐
       dataset (using trailing path separator in the query path):::

        % datalad status -d . mysubdataset/

       Report on the state of a subdataset in a superdataset and on the state within the subdataset::

        % datalad status -d . mysubdataset mysubdataset/

       Report the file size of annexed content in a dataset::

        % datalad status --annex

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       PATH   path to be evaluated. Constraints: value must be a string or value must be NONE

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>, <b>--help-np</b>
              show this help message. --help-np forcefully disables the use of a pager for displaying  the  help
              message

       <b>-d</b> <u>DATASET</u>, <b>--dataset</b> <u>DATASET</u>
              specify  the  dataset to query. If no dataset is given, an attempt is made to identify the dataset
              based on the current working directory. Constraints: Value must be a Dataset or a valid identifier
              of a Dataset (e.g. a path) or value must be NONE

       <b>--annex</b> [{basic|availability|all}]
              Switch whether to include information on the annex content of individual files in the  status  re‐
              port,  such as recorded file size. By default no annex information is reported (faster). Three re‐
              port modes are available: basic information like file size and key  name  ('basic');  additionally
              test whether file content is present in the local annex ('availability'; requires one or two addi‐
              tional  file  system stat calls, but does not call git-annex), this will add the result properties
              'has_content' (boolean flag) and 'objloc' (absolute path to an existing  annex  object  file);  or
              'all'  which  will  report  all available information (presently identical to 'availability'). The
              'basic' mode will be assumed when this option is given, but no  mode  is  specified.  Constraints:
              value must be one of ('basic', 'availability', 'all')

       <b>--untracked</b> {no|normal|all}
              If  and  how  untracked  content is reported when comparing a revision to the state of the working
              tree. 'no': no untracked content is reported; 'normal': untracked files and entire  untracked  di‐
              rectories  are  reported  as such; 'all': report individual files even in fully untracked directo‐
              ries. Constraints: value must be one of ('no', 'normal', 'all') [Default: 'normal']

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--recursive</b>
              if set, recurse into potential subdatasets.

       <b>-R</b> LEVELS, <b>--recursion-limit</b> LEVELS
              limit recursion into subdatasets to the given number of levels. Constraints: value  must  be  con‐
              vertible to type 'int' or value must be NONE

       <b>-e</b> {no|commit|full}, <b>--eval-subdataset-state</b> {no|commit|full}
              Evaluation  of subdataset state (clean vs. modified) can be expensive for deep dataset hierarchies
              as subdataset have to be tested recursively for uncommitted modifications. Setting this option  to
              'no'  or  'commit' can substantially boost performance by limiting what is being tested. With 'no'
              no state is evaluated and subdataset result records typically do not contain a  'state'  property.
              With 'commit' only a discrepancy of the HEAD commit shasum of a subdataset and the shasum recorded
              in  the superdataset's record is evaluated, and the 'state' result property only reflects this as‐
              pect. With 'full' any other modification is considered too (see the 'untracked' option for further
              tailoring modification testing). Constraints: value must be one of ('no', 'commit',  'full')  [De‐
              fault: 'full']

       <b>-t</b> {raw|eval}, <b>--report-filetype</b> {raw|eval}
              THIS OPTION IS IGNORED. It will be removed in a future release. Dataset component types are always
              reported  as-is  (previous 'raw' mode), unless annex-reporting is enabled with the --annex option,
              in which case symlinks that represent annexed files will be reported as type='file'.  Constraints:
              value must be one of ('raw', 'eval')

       <b>--version</b>
              show the module and its version which provides the command
