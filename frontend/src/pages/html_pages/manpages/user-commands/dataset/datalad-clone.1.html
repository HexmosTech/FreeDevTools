       <b>datalad</b> <b>clone</b> - obtain a dataset (copy) from a URL or local directory

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>datalad</b>  <b>clone</b>  [-h]  [-d  DATASET] [-D DESCRIPTION] [--reckless [auto|ephemeral|shared-...]] [--version]
              SOURCE [PATH] ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The purpose of this command is to obtain a new clone (copy) of a dataset and place it into a  not-yet-ex‐
       isting  or  empty  directory. As such CLONE provides a strict subset of the functionality offered by `in‐
       stall`. Only a single dataset can be obtained, and immediate recursive installation of subdatasets is not
       supported. However, once a (super)dataset is installed via CLONE, any content, including subdatasets  can
       be obtained by a subsequent `get` command.

       Primary differences over a direct `git clone` call are 1) the automatic initialization of a dataset annex
       (pure Git repositories are equally supported); 2) automatic registration of the newly obtained dataset as
       a  subdataset  (submodule),  if a parent dataset is specified; 3) support for additional resource identi‐
       fiers (DataLad resource identifiers as used on datasets.datalad.org, and  RIA  store  URLs  as  used  for
       store.datalad.org  -  optionally  in specific versions as identified by a branch or a tag; see examples);
       and 4) automatic configurable generation of alternative access URL for common cases  (such  as  appending
       '.git' to the URL in case the accessing the base URL failed).

       In  case  the clone is registered as a subdataset, the original URL passed to CLONE is recorded in `.git‐
       modules` of the parent dataset in addition to the resolved URL used internally for git-clone. This allows
       to preserve datalad specific URLs like ria+ssh://... for subsequent calls to GET if  the  subdataset  was
       locally removed later on.

       URL mapping configuration

       specifications.   A   substitution   specification   is   defined  as  a  configuration  setting  'datal‐
       ad.clone.url-substition.&lt;seriesID&gt;' with a string containing a match and  substitution  expression,  each
       following  Python's  regular expression syntax. Both expressions are concatenated to a single string with
       an arbitrary delimiter character. The delimiter is defined by prefixing the string  with  the  delimiter.
       Prefix  and delimiter are stripped from the expressions (Example: ",^http://(.*)$,https://1").  This set‐
       ting can be defined multiple times, using the same '&lt;seriesID&gt;'.  Substitutions in a series will  be  ap‐
       plied  incrementally,  in order of their definition.  The first substitution in such a series must match,
       otherwise no further substitutions in a series will be considered. However, following the first match all
       further substitutions in a series are processed, regardless whether  intermediate  expressions  match  or
       not.  Substitution series themselves have no particular order, each matching series will result in a can‐
       didate clone URL. Consequently, the initial match specification in a series should be as precise as  pos‐
       sible to prevent inflation of candidate URLs.

   <b>Examples</b>
       Install a dataset from GitHub into the current directory::

        % datalad clone https://github.com/datalad-datasets/longnow-podcasts.git

       Install a dataset into a specific directory::

        % datalad clone https://github.com/datalad-datasets/longnow-podcasts.git    myfavpodcasts

       Install a dataset as a subdataset into the current dataset::

        % datalad clone -d . https://github.com/datalad-datasets/longnow-podcasts.git

       Install the main superdataset from datasets.datalad.org::

        % datalad clone ///

       Install a dataset identified by a literal alias from store.datalad.org::

        % datalad clone ria+<a href="http://store.datalad.org">http://store.datalad.org</a>#~hcp-openaccess

       Install a dataset in a specific version as identified by a branch or tag name from store.datalad.org::

        % datalad clone ria+<a href="http://store.datalad.org">http://store.datalad.org</a>#76b6ca66-36b1-11ea-a2e6-f0d5bf7b5561@myidentifier

       Install a dataset with group-write access permissions::

        % datalad clone <a href="http://example.com/dataset">http://example.com/dataset</a> --reckless shared-group

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       SOURCE URL,  DataLad  resource  identifier,  local path or instance of dataset to be cloned. Constraints:
              value must be a string

       PATH   path to clone into. If no PATH is provided a destination path will be derived from  a  source  URL
              similar to git clone.

       GIT CLONE OPTIONS
              Options  to  pass  to git clone. Any argument specified after SOURCE and the optional PATH will be
              passed to git-clone. Note that not all options will lead to viable results. For example '--single-
              branch' will not result in a functional annex repository because both a  regular  branch  and  the
              git-annex branch are required. Note that a version in a RIA URL takes precedence over '--branch'.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>, <b>--help-np</b>
              show  this  help message. --help-np forcefully disables the use of a pager for displaying the help
              message

       <b>-d</b> <u>DATASET</u>, <b>--dataset</b> <u>DATASET</u>
              (parent) dataset to clone into. If given, the newly cloned dataset is registered as  a  subdataset
              of  the  parent.  Also,  if  given, relative paths are interpreted as being relative to the parent
              dataset, and not relative to the working directory. Constraints: Value must  be  a  Dataset  or  a
              valid identifier of a Dataset (e.g. a path) or value must be NONE

       <b>-D</b> <u>DESCRIPTION</u>, <b>--description</b> <u>DESCRIPTION</u>
              short description to use for a dataset location. Its primary purpose is to help humans to identify
              a dataset copy (e.g., "mike's dataset on lab server"). Note that when a dataset is published, this
              information  becomes  available  on  the remote side. Constraints: value must be a string or value
              must be NONE

       <b>--reckless</b> [auto|ephemeral|shared-...]
              Obtain a dataset or subdatset and set it up in a potentially unsafe way for performance, or access
              reasons. Use with care, any dataset is marked as 'untrusted'. The reckless mode  is  stored  in  a
              dataset's  local configuration under 'datalad.clone.reckless', and will be inherited to any of its
              subdatasets. Supported modes are: ['auto']: hard-link files between local clones. In-place modifi‐
              cation in any clone will alter original annex content. ['ephemeral']: symlink  annex  to  origin's
              annex  and  discard local availability info via git-annex-dead 'here' and declares this annex pri‐
              vate. Shares an annex between origin and clone w/o git-annex being aware  of  it.  In  case  of  a
              change  in origin you need to update the clone before you're able to save new content on your end.
              Alternative to 'auto' when hardlinks are not an option, or number of consumed inodes needs  to  be
              minimized.  Note  that  this mode can only be used with clones from non-bare repositories or a RIA
              store! Otherwise two different annex object tree structures (dirhashmixed vs dirhashlower) will be
              used simultaneously, and annex keys using the respective other  structure  will  be  inaccessible.
              ['shared-&lt;mode&gt;']:  set  up repository and annex permission to enable multi-user access. This dis‐
              ables the standard write protection of annex'ed files. &lt;mode&gt; can be any  value  support  by  'git
              init  --shared=',  such as 'group', or 'all'. Constraints: value must be one of (True, False, 'au‐
              to', 'ephemeral') or value must start with 'shared-'
