</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>datalad</b> <b>install</b> - install one or many datasets from remote URL(s) or local PATH source(s).

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>datalad</b>  <b>install</b>  [-h]  [-s  URL-OR-PATH] [-d DATASET] [-g] [-D DESCRIPTION] [-r] [-R LEVELS] [--reckless
              [auto|ephemeral|shared-...]] [-J NJOBS] [--branch BRANCH] [--version] [URL-OR-PATH ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This command creates local sibling(s) of existing dataset(s) from (remote) locations specified as  URL(s)
       or  path(s).  Optional  recursion into potential subdatasets, and download of all referenced data is sup‐
       ported.  The new dataset(s) can be optionally registered in an existing superdataset  by  identifying  it
       via the DATASET argument (the new dataset's path needs to be located within the superdataset for that).

       If  no explicit -s|--source option is specified, then all positional URL-OR-PATH arguments are considered
       to be "sources" if they are URLs or target locations if they are paths. If a target location path  corre‐
       sponds to a submodule, the source location for it is figured out from its record in the `.gitmodules`. If
       -s|--source  is  specified, then a single optional positional PATH would be taken as the destination path
       for that dataset.

       It is possible to provide a brief  description  to  label  the  dataset's  nature  *and*  location,  e.g.
       "Michael's music on black laptop". This helps humans to identify data locations in distributed scenarios.
       By default an identifier comprised of user and machine name, plus path will be generated.

       When  only  partial  dataset content shall be obtained, it is recommended to use this command without the
       `get-data` flag, followed by a `get` operation to obtain the desired data.

       NOTE   Power-user info: This command uses git clone, and git annex init to prepare the dataset. Register‐
              ing to a superdataset is performed via a git submodule add  operation  in  the  discovered  super‐
              dataset.

   <b>Examples</b>
       Install a dataset from GitHub into the current directory::

        % datalad install https://github.com/datalad-datasets/longnow-podcasts.git

       Install a dataset as a subdataset into the current dataset::

        % datalad install -d .    --source='https://github.com/datalad-datasets/longnow-podcasts.git'

       Install a dataset into 'podcasts' (not 'longnow-podcasts') directory, and get all content right away::

        % datalad install --get-data    -s https://github.com/datalad-datasets/longnow-podcasts.git podcasts

       Install a dataset with all its subdatasets::

        % datalad install -r    https://github.com/datalad-datasets/longnow-podcasts.git

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       URL-OR-PATH
              path/name  of  the  installation target. If no PATH is provided a destination path will be derived
              from a source URL similar to git clone.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>, <b>--help-np</b>
              show this help message. --help-np forcefully disables the use of a pager for displaying  the  help
              message

       <b>-s</b> URL-OR-PATH, <b>--source</b> URL-OR-PATH
              URL or local path of the installation source. Constraints: value must be a string or value must be
              NONE

       <b>-d</b> <u>DATASET</u>, <b>--dataset</b> <u>DATASET</u>
              specify  the  dataset  to  perform the install operation on. If no dataset is given, an attempt is
              made to identify the dataset in a parent directory of the current  working  directory  and/or  the
              PATH  given. Constraints: Value must be a Dataset or a valid identifier of a Dataset (e.g. a path)
              or value must be NONE

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--get-data</b>
              if given, obtain all data content too.

       <b>-D</b> <u>DESCRIPTION</u>, <b>--description</b> <u>DESCRIPTION</u>
              short description to use for a dataset location. Its primary purpose is to help humans to identify
              a dataset copy (e.g., "mike's dataset on lab server"). Note that when a dataset is published, this
              information becomes available on the remote side. Constraints: value must be  a  string  or  value
              must be NONE

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--recursive</b>
              if set, recurse into potential subdatasets.

       <b>-R</b> LEVELS, <b>--recursion-limit</b> LEVELS
              limit  recursion  into  subdatasets to the given number of levels. Constraints: value must be con‐
              vertible to type 'int' or value must be NONE

       <b>--reckless</b> [auto|ephemeral|shared-...]
              Obtain a dataset or subdatset and set it up in a potentially unsafe way for performance, or access
              reasons. Use with care, any dataset is marked as 'untrusted'. The reckless mode  is  stored  in  a
              dataset's  local configuration under 'datalad.clone.reckless', and will be inherited to any of its
              subdatasets. Supported modes are: ['auto']: hard-link files between local clones. In-place modifi‐
              cation in any clone will alter original annex content. ['ephemeral']: symlink  annex  to  origin's
              annex  and  discard local availability info via git-annex-dead 'here' and declares this annex pri‐
              vate. Shares an annex between origin and clone w/o git-annex being aware  of  it.  In  case  of  a
              change  in origin you need to update the clone before you're able to save new content on your end.
              Alternative to 'auto' when hardlinks are not an option, or number of consumed inodes needs  to  be
              minimized.  Note  that  this mode can only be used with clones from non-bare repositories or a RIA
              store! Otherwise two different annex object tree structures (dirhashmixed vs dirhashlower) will be
              used simultaneously, and annex keys using the respective other  structure  will  be  inaccessible.
              ['shared-&lt;mode&gt;']:  set  up repository and annex permission to enable multi-user access. This dis‐
              ables the standard write protection of annex'ed files. &lt;mode&gt; can be any  value  support  by  'git
              init  --shared=',  such as 'group', or 'all'. Constraints: value must be one of (True, False, 'au‐
              to', 'ephemeral') or value must start with 'shared-'

       <b>-J</b> NJOBS, <b>--jobs</b> NJOBS
              how many parallel jobs (where possible) to use. "auto" corresponds to the number defined by 'data‐
              lad.runtime.max-annex-jobs' configuration item NOTE: This option can only  parallelize  input  re‐
              trieval (get) and output recording (save). DataLad does NOT parallelize your scripts for you. Con‐
              straints:  value  must  be convertible to type 'int' or value must be NONE or value must be one of
              ('auto',) [Default: 'auto']

       <b>--branch</b> <u>BRANCH</u>
              Clone source at this branch or tag. This option applies only to the top-level dataset not any sub‐
              datasets that may be cloned when installing recursively. Note that if the source is a RIA URL with
              a version, it takes precedence over this option. Constraints: value must be a string or value must
              be NONE

       <b>--version</b>
              show the module and its version which provides the command
