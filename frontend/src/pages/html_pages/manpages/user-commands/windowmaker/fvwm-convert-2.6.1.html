       fvwm-convert-2.6 - convert fvwm 2.4.x configuration file to fvwm 2.6 style

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fvwm-convert-2.6</b> [<u>--follow-read</u>|<u>-f</u>] [<u>--help</u>|<u>-h</u>] source [<u>dest</u>]

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are supported:

       <b>--help</b> | <b>-h</b>
              Prints a usage message to the screen.

       <b>--follow-read</b> | <b>-f</b>
              Follows files found along with the <b>Read</b> command.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fvwm-convert-2.6</b>  converts  an fvwm 2.4.x configuration file into a fvwm 2.6 file with compatible syntax.
       It is not suitable to convert older 2.x configuration files.   Please  use  <b>fvwm-convert-2.2</b>  to  convert
       these to the 2.2.x format first, and then if necessary <b>fvwm-convert-2.4</b>

       By  default,  <b>fvwm-convert-2.6</b>  won't  look for a given config file.  This must be specified as the first
       parameter to <b>fvwm-convert-2.6.</b>  Different source and destination files may be given.  If the  destination
       file  already exists, this program exits.  If no destination file is given, then the filename is the same
       name as the source file with the suffix ".converted" added.   Without  an  absolute  path  given  as  the
       destination path to the destination file, the program will create the destination file in the CWD.

       <b>fvwm-convert-2.6</b> makes the following changes:

       <b>Style</b> <b>lines</b>
           In  fvwm  2.4,  most  style  options  could  be  negated from their counterparts using NoFoo -- fvwm-
           convert-2.6 corrects this by now using !Foo.

       <b>ModulePath</b>
           In fvwm 2.4 and beyond, the ModulePath is compiled into  fvwm.   <b>fvwm-convert-2.6</b>  comments  out  any
           ModulePath commands it finds.  If you are using your own modules, (not the ones that come with fvwm),
           you will have to fix your configuration file after using <b>fvwm-convert-2.6</b>.

       <b>Conditional</b> <b>command</b> <b>syntax</b>
           In  fvwm  2.4, the conditional command options were whitespace-separated -- they should now be comma-
           separated instead.  In addition, the older syntax to Next and Prev of using [*] to denote all windows
           has been removed entirely.  Both  these  checks  and  conversions  are  done  on  function  commands,
           key/mouse bindings.

       <b>WindowShadeSteps</b>
           In  fvwm  2.4,  the WindowShadeSteps command is replaced by the WindowShadeSteps Style option.  <b>fvwm-</b>
           <b>convert-2.6</b> makes this change.

       <b>FvwmTheme</b>
           In fvwm 2.6, the FvwmTheme module is replaced  by  a  series  of  Colorset  commands.   Whilst  <b>fvwm-</b>
           <b>convert-2.6</b>  will  try  and  make  this  change,  it  is still recommended that this is checked after
           conversion.

       <b>EdgeResistance</b>
           In fvwm 2.6, the EdgeResistance command is has been split to include an additional style  option  for
           EdgeMoveResistance.  <b>fvwm-convert-2.6</b> makes any changes necessary.

       <b>StartFunction</b> <b>/</b> <b>RestartFunction</b> <b>/</b> <b>InitFunction</b>
           In  fvwm  2.6, the need for using InitFunction and/or RestartFunction is redundant when StartFunction
           is read at both of these times.  <b>fvwm-convert-2.6</b> attempts to convert this.

       <b>Read</b>
           If <b>-f</b> or <b>--follow-read</b> is given, any files <b>fvwm-convert-2.6</b> can detect and  open  will  be  converted
           automatically, else a list of files that can be followed are printed to the screen.

       <b>BUGS</b>

              <u>InitFunction</u>  and  <u>RestartFunction</u>  and hence <u>StartFunction</u> are printed at the end of the files --
              this slight reordering might put some comments before in an odd spot.

              When converting over FvwmTheme lines, the colorset definitions might well  be  broken,  but  these
              cannot easily be converted.

              Bug reports can be sent to the fvwm-workers mailing list (see the <u>FAQ</u>).
