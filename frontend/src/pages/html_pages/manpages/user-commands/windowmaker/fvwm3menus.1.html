</pre><h4><b>MENUS</b></h4><pre>
       Before a menu can be opened, it has to be populated with menu items using the <b>AddToMenu</b> command and bound
       to a key or mouse button with the <b>Key</b>, <b>PointerKey</b> or <b>Mouse</b> command (there are many other ways to invoke a
       menu too). This is usually done in the configuration file.

       Fvwm menus are extremely configurable in look and feel. Even the slightest nuances can be changed to the
       userâ€™s liking, including the menu item fonts, the background, delays before popping up sub menus,
       generating menus dynamically and many other features. Please refer to the <b>MenuStyle</b> command to learn
       more.

       <b>Types</b> <b>of</b> <b>Menus</b>
           There are four slightly different types of menus:

           Popup menus can appear everywhere on the screen on their own or attached to a part of a window. The
           <b>Popup</b> command opens popup menus. If the popup menu was invoked with a mouse button held down, it is
           closed when the button is released. The item under the pointer is then activated and the associated
           action is executed.

           Normal menus are very similar command, but slightly transient. When invoked by clicking a mouse
           button, they stay open and can be navigated with no button held. But if invoked by a button press
           followed by mouse motion, it behaves exactly like a popup menu. The <b>Menu</b> command creates normal
           menus.

           "Sub menus" are menus inside other menus. When a menu item that has the <b>Popup</b> command as its action
           is selected, the named menu is opened as a sub menu to the parent. Any type of menu can have sub
           menus.

           "Tear off menus" are menus that have been "torn off" their original context on the desktop like a
           normal window. They are created from other menus by certain key presses or mouse sequences or with
           the <b>TearMenuOff</b> command from inside a menu.

       <b>Menu</b> <b>Anatomy</b>
           Menus consist of any number of titles which are inactive menu items that usually appear at the top of
           the menu, normal items triggering various actions when selected, separator lines between the items,
           tear off bars (a horizontal broken line) that tear off the menu when selected, and sub menu items
           indicated with a triangle pointing left or right, depending on the direction in which the sub menu
           appears. All the above menu items are optional.

           Additionally, if the menu is too long to fit on the screen, the excess menu items are put in a
           continuation menu and a sub menu with the string "More..." is placed at the bottom of the menu. The
           "More..." string honors the locale settings.

           Finally, there may be a picture running up either side of the menu (a "side bar").

       <b>Menu</b> <b>Navigation</b>
           Menus are navigated with the keyboard and the mouse. Many people prefer to use the mouse, but it can
           be tedious. Keyboard navigation can be much faster. While fvwm displays a menu, it can do nothing
           else. For example, new windows do not appear before the menu is closed. However, this is not exactly
           true for tear off menus. See the <b>Tear</b> <b>Off</b> <b>Menus</b> section for details.

       <b>Mouse</b> <b>Navigation</b>
           Moving the pointer over a menu selects the item below it. Normally this is indicated by a 3d border
           around the item, but not all parts of a menu can be selected. Pressing any mouse button while a menu
           is open by default activates the item below it. Items of a popup menu are also activated by releasing
           a held mouse button. In case of an item that hides a sub menu, the sub menu is displayed if the
           pointer hovers over the item long enough or moves close to the triangle indicating the sub menu. This
           behaviour can be tuned with menu styles.

           Scrolling a mouse wheel over a menu either wraps the pointer along the menu (default), scrolls the
           menu under the pointer or act as if the menu was clicked depending on the <u>MouseWheel</u> menu style.

           Clicking on a selected item activates it - what happens exactly depends on the type of the item.

           Clicking on a title, a separator, the side bar, or outside the menu closes the menu (exception: tear
           off menus can not be closed this way). Pressing mouse button 2 over a menu title or activating a tear
           off bar creates a tear off menu from the current menu. Clicking on a normal menu item invokes the
           command that is bound to it, and clicking on a sub menu item either closes all open menus and
           replaces them with the sub menu or posts the menu (default).

           Posting menus is meant to ease mouse navigation. Once a sub menu is posted, only items from that sub
           menu can be selected. This can be very useful to navigate the menu if the pointer tends to stray off
           the menu. To unpost the menu and revert back to normal operation, either click on the same sub menu
           item or press any key.

       <b>Keyboard</b> <b>Navigation</b>
           Just like with mouse navigation, the item below the pointer is selected. This is achieved by warping
           the pointer to the menu items when necessary. While a menu is open, all key presses are intercepted
           by the menu. No other application can get keyboard input (although this is not the case for tear off
           menus).

           Items can be selected directly by pressing a hotkey that can be configured individually for each menu
           item. The hotkey is indicated by underlining it in the menu item label. With the <u>AutomaticHotkeys</u>
           menu style fvwm automatically assigns hotkeys to all menu items.

           The most basic keys to navigate through menus are the cursor keys (move up or down one item, enter or
           leave a sub menu),

           (activate item) and

           (close menu). Numerous other keys can be used to navigate through menus by default:

           <u>Enter</u>, <u>Return</u>, <u>Space</u> activate the current item.

           <u>Escape</u>, <u>Delete</u>, <u>Ctrl-G</u> exit the current sequence of menus or destroy a tear off menu.

           <u>J</u>, <u>N</u>, <u>Cursor-Down</u>, <u>Tab</u>, <u>Meta-Tab</u>, <u>Ctrl-F</u>, move to the next item.

           <u>K</u>, <u>P</u>, <u>Cursor-Up</u>, <u>Shift-Tab</u>, <u>Shift-Meta-Tab</u>, <u>Ctrl-B</u>, move to the prior item.

           <u>L</u>, <u>Cursor-Right</u>, <u>F</u> enter a sub menu.

           <u>H</u>, <u>Cursor-Left</u>, <u>B</u> return to the prior menu.

           <u>Ctrl-Cursor-Up</u>, <u>Ctrl-K</u> <u>Ctrl-P</u>, <u>Shift-Ctrl-Meta-Tab</u>, <u>Page-Up</u> move up five items.

           <u>Ctrl-Cursor-Down</u>, <u>Ctrl-J</u> <u>Ctrl-N</u>, <u>Ctrl-Meta-Tab</u> <u>Page-Down</u> move down five items.

           <u>Shift-P</u>, <u>Home</u>, <u>Shift-Cursor-Up</u>, <u>Ctrl-A</u> move to the first item.

           <u>Shift-N</u>, <u>End</u>, <u>Shift-Cursor-Down</u>, <u>Ctrl-E</u> move to the last item.

           <u>Meta-P</u>, <u>Meta-Cursor-Up</u>, <u>Ctrl-Cursor-Left</u>, <u>Shift-Ctrl-Tab</u>, move up just below the next separator.

           <u>Meta-N</u>, <u>Meta-Cursor-Down</u>, <u>Ctrl-Cursor-Right</u>, <u>Ctrl-Tab</u>, move down just below the next separator.

           <u>Insert</u> opens the "More..." sub menu if any.

           <u>Backspace</u> tears off the menu.

       <b>Menu</b> <b>Bindings</b>
           The keys and mouse buttons used to navigate the menu can be configured using the <b>Key</b> and <b>Mouse</b>
           commands with the special context 'M', possible combined with 'T' for the menu title, 'I' for other
           menu items, 'S' for any border or sidepic, '[' for left border including a left sidepic, ']' for
           right border including a right sidepic, '-' for top border, '_' for bottom border. The menu context
           uses its own set of actions that can be bound to keys and mouse buttons. These are _MenuClose_,
           <u>MenuCloseAndExec</u>, <u>MenuEnterContinuation</u>, <u>MenuEnterSubmenu</u>, <u>MenuLeaveSubmenu</u>, <u>MenuMoveCursor</u>,
           <u>MenuCursorLeft</u>, <u>MenuCursorRight</u>, <u>MenuSelectItem</u>, <u>MenuScroll</u> and <u>MenuTearOff</u>.

           It is not possible to override the key Escape with no modifiers for closing the menu. Neither is it
           possible to undefine mouse button 1, the arrow keys or the enter key for minimal navigation.

           <b>MenuClose</b> exits from the current sequence of menus or destroys a tear off menu.

           <b>MenuCloseAndExec</b> exits from the current sequence of menus or destroys a tear off menu and executes
           the rest of the line as a command.

           <b>MenuEnterContinuation</b> opens the "More..." sub menu if any.

           <b>MenuEnterSubmenu</b> enters a sub menu.

           <b>MenuLeaveSubmenu</b> returns to the prior menu.

           <b>MenuMoveCursor</b> <u>n</u> [<u>m</u>] moves the selection to another item. If the first argument is zero the second
           argument specifies an absolute item in the menu to move the pointer to. Negative items are counted
           from the end of the menu. If the first argument is non-zero, the second argument must be omitted, and
           the first argument specifies a relative change in the selected item. The positions may be suffixed
           with a 's' to indicate that the items should refer only to the first items after separators.

           <b>MenuCursorLeft</b> enters a sub menu with the <u>SubmenusLeft</u> menu style, and returns to the prior menu with
           the <u>SubmenusRight</u> menu style.

           <b>MenuCursorRight</b> enters a sub menu with the <u>SubmenusRight</u> menu style, and returns to the prior menu
           with the <u>SubmenusLeft</u> menu style.

           <b>MenuSelectItem</b> triggers the action for the menu item.

           <b>MenuScroll</b> <u>n</u> performs menu scrolling according to the <u>MouseWheel</u> menu style with <u>n</u> items. The
           distance can be suffixed with an 's' to indicate the items should refer only to the first items after
           separators.

           <b>MenuTearOff</b> turns a normal menu into a "torn off" menu. See <b>Tear</b> <b>Off</b> <b>Menus</b> for details.

       <b>Tear</b> <b>Off</b> <b>Menus</b>
           A tear off menu is any menu that has been "torn off" the window it was attached to and pinned to the
           root window. There are three ways to tear off a menu: click on the menu title with mouse button 2,
           press

           in the menu or activate its tear off bar (a horizontal bar with a broken line). Tear off bars must be
           added to the menu as any other item by assigning them the command <b>TearMenuOff</b>.

           The builtin tear off actions can be overridden by undefining the builtin menu actions bound to tear
           off. To remove the builtin mouse button 2 binding, use:

               Mouse 2 MT A -

           and to remove the builtin backspace binding, use:

               Key Backspace M A -

           See the section <b>Menu</b> <b>Bindings</b> for details on how to assign other bindings for tear off.

           Note that prior to fvwm 2.5.20 the tear off mouse bindings were redefined in different way, which no
           longer work.

           The window containing the menu is placed as any other window would be. If you find it confusing to
           have your tear off menus appear at random positions on the screen, put this line in your
           configuration file:

               Style fvwm_menu UsePPosition

           To remove borders and buttons from a tear-off menu but keep the menu title, you can use

               Style fvwm_menu !Button 0, !Button 1
               Style fvwm_menu !Button 2, !Button 3
               Style fvwm_menu !Button 4, !Button 5
               Style fvwm_menu !Button 6, !Button 7
               Style fvwm_menu !Button 8, !Button 9
               Style fvwm_menu Title, HandleWidth 0

           A tear off menu is a cross breeding between a window and a menu. The menu is swallowed by a window
           and its title is stripped off and displayed in the window title. The main advantage is that the menu
           becomes permanent - activating an item does not close the menu. Therefore, it can be used multiple
           times without reopening it. To destroy such a menu, close its window or press the Escape key.

           Tear off menus behave somewhat differently than normal menus and windows. They do not take the
           keyboard focus, but while the pointer is over one of them, all key presses are sent to the menu.
           Other fvwm key bindings are disabled as long as the pointer is inside the tear off menu or one of its
           sub menus. When the pointer leaves this area, all sub menus are closed immediately. Note that the
           window containing a tear off menu is never hilighted as if it had the focus.

           A tear off menu is an independent copy of the menu it originated from. As such, it is not affected by
           adding items to that menu or changing its menu style.

           To create a tear off menu without opening the normal menu first, the option <u>TearOffImmediately</u> can be
           added to the <b>Menu</b> or <b>Popup</b> command.

   <b>Building</b> <b>menu</b> <b>contents</b>
       <b>AddToMenu</b> <u>menu-name</u> [<u>menu-label</u> <u>action</u>]
           Begins or adds to a menu definition. Typically a menu definition looks like this:

               AddToMenu Utilities Utilities Title
                + Xterm           Exec  exec xterm -e tcsh
                + Rxvt            Exec  exec rxvt
                + "Remote Logins" Popup Remote-Logins
                + Top             Exec  exec rxvt -T Top -n Top -e top
                + Calculator      Exec  exec xcalc
                + Xman            Exec  exec xman
                + Xmag            Exec  exec xmag
                + emacs           Exec  exec xemacs
                + Mail            MailFunction xmh "-font fixed"
                + ""              Nop
                + Modules         Popup Module-Popup
                + ""              Nop
                + Exit Fvwm       Popup Quit-Verify

           The menu could be invoked via

               Mouse 1 R A Menu Utilities Nop

           or

               Mouse 1 R A Popup Utilities

           There is no end-of-menu symbol. Menus do not have to be defined in a contiguous region of the <u>config</u>
           file. The quoted (or first word) portion in the above examples is the menu label, which appears in
           the menu when the user pops it up. The remaining portion is an fvwm command which is executed if the
           user selects that menu item. An empty menu-label ("") and the <b>Nop</b> function are used to insert a
           separator into the menu.

           The keywords <u>DynamicPopUpAction</u> and <u>DynamicPopDownAction</u> have a special meaning when used as the name
           of a menu item. The action following the keyword is executed whenever the menu is popped up or down.
           This way you can implement dynamic menus. It is even possible to destroy itself with <b>DestroyMenu</b> and
           the rebuild from scratch. When the menu has been destroyed (unless you used the <u>recreate</u> option when
           destroying the menu), do not forget to add the dynamic action again.

           Note: Do not trigger actions that require user interaction. They may fail and may screw up your
           menus. See the <b>Silent</b> command.

           <b>Warning</b> Do not issue <b>MenuStyle</b> commands as dynamic menu actions. Chances are good that this crashes
           fvwm.

           The keyword <u>Greyed</u> will still render the menu item, but will grey it out making the option
           unselectable.

           There are several configurable scripts installed together with fvwm for automatic menu generation.
           They have their own man pages. Some of them, specifically <b>fvwm-menu-directory</b> and <b>fvwm-menu-desktop</b>,
           may be used with <u>DynamicPopupAction</u> to create a directory listing or GNOME/KDE application listing.

           Example (File browser):

               # You can find the shell script fvwm_make_browse_menu.sh
               # in the utils/ directory of the distribution.
               AddToMenu BrowseMenu
               + DynamicPopupAction PipeRead \
               'fvwm_make_browse_menu.sh BrowseMenu'

           Example (Picture menu):

               # Build a menu of all .jpg files in
               # $HOME/Pictures
               AddToMenu JpgMenu foo title
               + DynamicPopupAction Function MakeJpgMenu

               AddToFunc MakeJpgMenu
               + I DestroyMenu recreate JpgMenu
               + I AddToMenu JpgMenu Pictures Title
               + I PipeRead 'for i in $HOME/Pictures/*.jpg; \
               do echo AddToMenu JpgMenu "`basename $i`" Exec xv $i; done'

           The keyword <u>MissingSubmenuFunction</u> has a similar meaning. It is executed whenever you try to pop up a
           sub menu that does not exist. With this function you can define and destroy menus on the fly. You can
           use any command after the keyword, but if the name of an item (that is a submenu) defined with
           <b>AddToFunc</b> follows it, fvwm executes this command:

               Function &lt;function-name&gt; &lt;submenu-name&gt;

           i.e. the name is passed to the function as its first argument and can be referred to with "$0".

           The <b>fvwm-menu-directory</b> script mentioned above may be used with <u>MissingSubmenuFunction</u> to create an
           up to date recursive directory listing.

           Example:

               # There is another shell script fvwm_make_directory_menu.sh
               # in the utils/ directory of the distribution. To use it,
               # define this function in your configuration file:

               DestroyFunc MakeMissingDirectoryMenu
               AddToFunc MakeMissingDirectoryMenu
               + I PipeRead fvwm_make_directory_menu.sh $0

               DestroyMenu SomeMenu
               AddToMenu SomeMenu
               + MissingSubmenuFunction MakeMissingDirectoryMenu
               + "Root directory" Popup /

           This is another implementation of the file browser that uses sub menus for subdirectories.

           Titles can be used within the menu. If you add the option <u>top</u> behind the keyword <b>Title</b>, the title is
           added to the top of the menu. If there was a title already, it is overwritten.

               AddToMenu Utilities Tools Title top

           All text up to the first Tab in the menu label is aligned to the left side of t the menu, all text
           right of the first is aligned to the left in a second column and all text thereafter is placed right
           aligned in the third column. All other s are replaced by spaces. Note that you can change this format
           with the <u>ItemFormat</u> option of the <b>MenuStyle</b> command.

           If the menu-label contains an ampersand ('&amp;'), the next character is taken as a hot-key for the menu
           item. Hot-keys are underlined in the label. To get a literal '&amp;', insert "&amp;&amp;". Pressing the hot-key
           moves through the list of menu items with this hot-key or selects an item that is the only one with
           this hot-key.

           If the menu-label contains a sub-string which is set off by stars, then the text between the stars is
           expected to be the name of an image file to insert in the menu. To get a literal '<b>',</b> <b>insert</b> <b>"</b>*". For
           example

               + Calculator*xcalc.xpm* Exec exec xcalc

           inserts a menu item labeled "Calculator" with a picture of a calculator above it. The following:

               + *xcalc.xpm*           Exec exec xcalc

           Omits the "Calculator" label, but leaves the picture.

           If the menu-label contains a sub-string which is set off by percent signs, then the text between the
           percent signs is expected to be the name of image file (a so called mini icon to insert to the left
           of the menu label. A second mini icon that is drawn at the right side of the menu can be given in the
           same way. To get a literal '%', insert "%%". For example

               + Calculator%xcalc.xpm% Exec exec xcalc

           inserts a menu item labeled "Calculator" with a picture of a calculator to the left. The following:

               + %xcalc.xpm%           Exec exec xcalc

           Omits the "Calculator" label, but leaves the picture. The pictures used with this feature should be
           small (perhaps 16x16).

           If the menu-name (not the label) contains a sub-string which is set off by at signs ('@'), then the
           text between them is expected to be the name of an image file to draw along the left side of the menu
           (a side pixmap). You may want to use the <u>SidePic</u> option of the <b>MenuStyle</b> command instead. To get a
           literal '@', insert "@@". For example

               AddToMenu <a href="mailto:StartMenu@linux-menu.xpm">StartMenu@linux-menu.xpm</a>@

           creates a menu with a picture in its bottom left corner.

           If the menu-name also contains a sub-string surrounded by '^'s, then the text between '^'s is
           expected to be the name of an X11 color and the column containing the side picture is colored with
           that color. You can set this color for a menu style using the <u>SideColor</u> option of the <b>MenuStyle</b>
           command. To get a literal '^', insert "^^". Example:

               AddToMenu <a href="mailto:StartMenu@linux-menu.xpm">StartMenu@linux-menu.xpm</a>@^blue^

           creates a menu with a picture in its bottom left corner and colors with blue the region of the menu
           containing the picture.

           In all the above cases, the name of the resulting menu is name specified, stripped of the substrings
           between the various delimiters.

       <b>DestroyMenu</b> [recreate] <u>menu</u>
           Deletes a menu, so that subsequent references to it are no longer valid. You can use this to change
           the contents of a menu during an fvwm session. The menu can be rebuilt using <b>AddToMenu</b>. The optional
           parameter <u>recreate</u> tells fvwm not to throw away the menu completely but to throw away all the menu
           items (including the title).

               DestroyMenu Utilities

       <b>Title</b>
           Does nothing. It is used to insert a title line in a popup or menu.

   <b>Commands</b> <b>that</b> <b>open</b> <b>menus</b>
       <b>Menu</b> <u>menu-name</u> [<u>position</u>] [<u>double-click-action</u>]
           Causes a previously defined menu to be popped up in a sticky manner. That is, if the user invokes the
           menu with a click action instead of a drag action, the menu stays up. The command <u>double-click-action</u>
           is invoked if the user double-clicks a button (or hits the key rapidly twice if the menu is bound to
           a key) when bringing up the menu. If the double click action is not specified, double clicking on the
           menu does nothing. However, if the menu begins with a menu item (i.e. not with a title or a
           separator) and the double click action is not given, double clicking invokes the first item of the
           menu (but only if the pointer really was over the item).

           The pointer is warped to where it was when the menu was invoked if it was both invoked and closed
           with a keystroke.

           The <u>position</u> arguments allow placement of the menu somewhere on the screen, for example centered on
           the visible screen or above a title bar. Basically it works like this: you specify a
           <u>context-rectangle</u> and an offset to this rectangle by which the upper left corner of the menu is moved
           from the upper left corner of the rectangle. The <u>position</u> arguments consist of several parts:

           [<u>context-rectangle</u>] <u>x</u> <u>y</u> [<u>special</u> <u>options</u>]

           The <u>context-rectangle</u> can be one of:

           <u>Root</u>
               the root window of the current screen.

           <u>Monitor</u>
               the area of the current RandR screen.

           <u>Mouse</u>
               a 1x1 rectangle at the mouse position.

           <u>Window</u>
               the frame of the context window.

           <u>Interior</u>
               the inside of the context window.

           <u>Title</u>
               the title of the context window or icon.

           <u>Button&lt;n&gt;</u>
               button &lt;n&gt; of the context window.

           <u>Icon</u>
               the icon of the context window.

           <u>Menu</u>
               the current menu.

           <u>Item</u>
               the current menu item.

           <u>Context</u>
               the current window, menu or icon.

           <u>This</u>
               whatever widget the pointer is on (e.g. a corner of a window or the root window).

           <u>Rectangle</u> &lt;_geometry_&gt;
               the rectangle defined by &lt;_geometry_&gt; in X geometry format. Width and height default to 1 if
               omitted.

               If the context-rectangle is omitted or invalid (e.g. "item" on a window), "Mouse" is the default.
               Note that not all of these make sense under all circumstances (e.g. "Icon" if the pointer is on a
               menu).

               The offset values <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> specify how far the menu is moved from its default position. By
               default, the numeric value given is interpreted as a percentage of the context rectangleâ€™s width
               (height), but with a trailing '<u>m</u>' the menuâ€™s width (height) is used instead. Furthermore a
               trailing '<u>p</u>' changes the interpretation to mean pixels.

               Instead of a single value you can use a list of values. All additional numbers after the first
               one are separated from their predecessor by their sign. Do not use any other separators.

               If <u>x</u> or <u>y</u> are prefixed with "'<u>o</u>&lt;number&gt;" where &lt;number&gt; is an integer, the menu and the rectangle
               are moved to overlap at the specified position before any other offsets are applied. The menu and
               the rectangle are placed so that the pixel at &lt;number&gt; percent of the rectangleâ€™s width/height is
               right over the pixel at &lt;number&gt; percent of the menuâ€™s width/height. So "o0" means that the
               top/left borders of the menu and the rectangle overlap, with "o100" itâ€™s the bottom/right borders
               and if you use "o50" they are centered upon each other (try it and you will see it is much
               simpler than this description). The default is "o0". The prefix "o&lt;number&gt;" is an abbreviation
               for "+&lt;number&gt;-&lt;number&gt;m".

               A prefix of '<u>c</u>' is equivalent to "o50". Examples:

                   # window list in the middle of the screen
                   WindowList Root c c

                   # menu to the left of a window
                   Menu name window -100m c+0

                   # popup menu 8 pixels above the mouse pointer
                   Popup name mouse c -100m-8p

                   # somewhere on the screen
                   Menu name rectangle 512x384+1+1 +0 +0

                   # centered vertically around a menu item
                   AddToMenu foobar-menu
                    + "first item" Nop
                    + "special item" Popup "another menu" item +100 c
                    + "last item" Nop

                   # above the first menu item
                   AddToMenu foobar-menu
                    + "first item" Popup "another menu" item +0 -100m

               Note that you can put a sub menu far off the current menu so you could not reach it with the
               mouse without leaving the menu. If the pointer leaves the current menu in the general direction
               of the sub menu the menu stays up.

           <u>Special</u> <u>options</u>

               To create a tear off menu without opening the normal menu, add the option <u>TearOffImmediately</u>.
               Normally the menu opens in normal state for a split second before being torn off. As tearing off
               places the menu like any other window, a position should be specified explicitly:

                   # Forbid fvwm to place the menu window
                   Style &lt;name of menu&gt; UsePPosition
                   # Menu at top left corner of screen
                   Menu Root 0p 0p TearOffImmediately

               The <u>Animated</u> and <u>Mwm</u> or <u>Win</u> menu styles may move a menu somewhere else on the screen. If you do
               not want this you can add <u>Fixed</u> as an option. This might happen for example if you want the menu
               always in the top right corner of the screen.

               Where do you want a menu to appear when you click on its menu item? The default is to place the
               title under the cursor, but if you want it where the position arguments say, use the
               <u>SelectInPlace</u> option. If you want the pointer on the title of the menu, use <u>SelectWarp</u> too. Note
               that these options apply only if the <u>PopupAsRootMenu</u> <b>MenuStyle</b> option is used.

               The pointer is warped to the title of a sub menu whenever the pointer would be on an item when
               the sub menu is popped up (<u>fvwm</u> menu style) or never warped to the title at all (<u>Mwm</u> or <u>Win</u> menu
               styles). You can force (forbid) warping whenever the sub menu is opened with the <u>WarpTitle</u>
               (<u>NoWarp</u>) option.

               Note that the <u>special-options</u> do work with a normal menu that has no other position arguments.

       <b>Popup</b> <u>PopupName</u> [<u>position</u>] [<u>default-action</u>]
           This command has two purposes: to bind a menu to a key or mouse button, and to bind a sub menu into a
           menu. The formats for the two purposes differ slightly. The <u>position</u> arguments are the same as for
           <b>Menu</b>. The command <u>default-action</u> is invoked if the user clicks a button to invoke the menu and
           releases it immediately again (or hits the key rapidly twice if the menu is bound to a key). If the
           default action is not specified, double clicking on the menu does nothing. However, if the menu
           begins with a menu item (i.e. not with a title or a separator) and the default action is not given,
           double clicking invokes the first item of the menu (but only if the pointer really was over the
           item).

           To bind a previously defined pop-up menu to a key or mouse button:

           The following example binds mouse buttons 2 and 3 to a pop-up called "Window Ops". The menu pops up
           if the buttons 2 or 3 are pressed in the window frame, side-bar, or title-bar, with no modifiers
           (none of shift, control, or meta).

               Mouse 2 FST N Popup "Window Ops"
               Mouse 3 FST N Popup "Window Ops"

           Pop-ups can be bound to keys through the use of the <b>Key</b> command. Pop-ups can be operated without
           using the mouse by binding to keys and operating via the up arrow, down arrow, and enter keys.

           To bind a previously defined pop-up menu to another menu, for use as a sub menu:

           The following example defines a sub menu "Quit-Verify" and binds it into a main menu, called
           "RootMenu":

               AddToMenu Quit-Verify
                + "Really Quit Fvwm?" Title
                + "Yes, Really Quit"  Quit
                + "Restart Fvwm"      Restart
                + ""                  Nop
                + "No, Don't Quit"    Nop

               AddToMenu RootMenu "Root Menu" Title
                + "Open XTerm Window" Popup NewWindowMenu
                + "Login as Root"     Exec exec xterm -T Root -n Root -e su -
                + "Login as Anyone"   Popup AnyoneMenu
                + "Remote Hosts"      Popup HostMenu
                + ""                  Nop
                + "X utilities"       Popup Xutils
                + ""                  Nop
                + "Fvwm Modules"      Popup Module-Popup
                + "Fvwm Window Ops"   Popup Window-Ops
                + ""                  Nop
                + "Previous Focus"    Prev (AcceptsFocus) Focus
                + "Next Focus"        Next (AcceptsFocus) Focus
                + ""                  Nop
                + "Refresh screen"    Refresh
                + ""                  Nop
                + "Reset X defaults"  Exec xrdb -load \
                                $HOME/.Xdefaults
                + ""                  Nop
                + ""                  Nop
                + Quit                Popup Quit-Verify

           Popup differs from <b>Menu</b> in that pop-ups do not stay up if the user simply clicks. These are
           popup-menus, which are a little hard on the wrist. <b>Menu</b> menus stay up on a click action. See the <b>Menu</b>
           command for an explanation of the interactive behavior of menus. A menu can be open up to ten times
           at once, so a menu may even use itself or any of its predecessors as a sub menu.

       <b>TearMenuOff</b>
           When assigned to a menu item, it inserts a tear off bar into the menu (a horizontal broken line).
           Activating that item tears off the menu. If the menu item has a label, it is shown instead of the
           broken line. If used outside menus, this command does nothing. Examples:

               AddToMenu WindowMenu
               + I "" TearMenuOff

               AddToMenu RootMenu
               + I "click here to tear me off" TearMenuOff

   <b>Menu</b> <b>style</b> <b>commands</b>
       Menu styles describe the looks and behaviour like normal styles do for windows. Menu styles are assigned
       to individual or all menus, and changing the menu style immediately affects all menus that use it. (If a
       menu style is used from within a menu, the changes are applied the next time an affected menu is opened.)

       <b>ChangeMenuStyle</b> <u>menustyle</u> <u>menu</u> ...
           Changes the menu style of <u>menu</u> to <u>menustyle</u>. You may specify more than one menu in each call of
           <b>ChangeMenuStyle</b>.

       <b>CopyMenuStyle</b> <u>orig-menustyle</u> <u>dest-menustyle</u>
           Copy <u>orig-menustyle</u> to <u>dest-menustyle</u>, where <u>orig-menustyle</u> is an existing menu style. If the menu
           style <u>dest_menustyle</u> does not exist, then it is created.

       <b>DestroyMenuStyle</b> <u>menustyle</u>
           Deletes the menu style named <u>menustyle</u> and changes all menus using this style to the default style,
           you cannot destroy the default menu style.

               DestroyMenuStyle pixmap1

       <b>MenuStyle</b> <u>stylename</u> [<u>options</u>]
           Sets a new menu style or changes a previously defined style. The <u>stylename</u> is the style name; if it
           contains spaces or tabs it has to be quoted. The name "<b>"</b> <b>is</b> <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>default</b> <b>menu</b> <b>style.</b> <b>The</b>
           <b>default</b> <b>menu</b> <b>style</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>menu-like</b> <b>object</b> <b>(e.g.</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>*WindowList</b>
           command) that had not be assigned a style using the <b>ChangeMenuStyle</b>. See also <b>DestroyMenuStyle</b>. When
           using monochrome color options are ignored.

           <u>options</u> is a comma separated list containing some of the keywords Fvwm / Mwm / Win, BorderWidth,

           !TrianglesUseFore, Translucent / !Translucent.

           In the above list some options are listed as option pairs or triples with a '/' in between. These
           options exclude each other. All paired options can be negated to have the effect of the counterpart
           option by prefixing ! to the option.

           <u>Fvwm</u>, <u>Mwm</u>, <u>Win</u> reset all options to the style with the same name in former versions of fvwm. The
           default for new menu styles is <u>Fvwm</u> style. These options override all others except <u>HilightBack</u>,
           <u>ActiveFore</u> and <u>PopupDelay</u>, so they should be used only as the first option specified for a menu style
           or to reset the style to defined behavior. The same effect can be created by setting all the other
           options one by one.

           <u>Mwm</u> and <u>Win</u> style menus popup sub menus automatically. <u>Win</u> menus indicate the current menu item by
           changing the background to dark. <u>Fvwm</u> sub menus overlap the parent menu, <u>Mwm</u> and <u>Win</u> style menus
           never overlap the parent menu.

           <u>BorderWidth</u> takes the thickness of the border around the menus in pixels. It may be zero to 50
           pixels. The default is 2. Using an invalid value reverts the border width to the default.

           <u>HilightBack</u> and <u>!HilightBack</u> switch hilighting the background of the selected menu item on and off.
           The <u>ActiveColorset</u> background color is used for the hilighting.

           <u>HilightTitleBack</u> switches hilighting the background of menu titles on. The <u>TitleColorset</u> background
           color is used for the hilighting.

           <u>ActiveFore</u> and <u>!ActiveFore</u> switch hilighting the foreground of the selected menu item on and off. The
           <u>ActiveColorset</u> foreground color is used for the hilighting.

           <u>MenuColorset</u> controls the colorset used to color the menu. If the colorset has a pixmap or gradient
           defined, this is used as the background of the menu. The shape mask from the colorset is used to
           shape the menu. Please refer to the <b>Colorsets</b> section for details about colorsets.

           <u>ActiveColorset</u> controls the color of the active menu item, provided the <u>HilightBack</u> or <u>ActiveFore</u>
           menu styles are used. If specified, the hilight and shadow colors from the colorset are used too. The
           pixmap and shape mask from the colorset are not used. Hilighting the background or foreground can be
           turned off individually with the <u>!ActiveFore</u> or <u>!HilightBack</u> menu styles.

           <u>GreyedColorset</u> works exactly like <u>MenuColorset</u>, but the foreground from the colorset replaces the
           color given with the <u>Greyed</u> menu style. No other parts of the colorset are used.

           <u>TitleColorset</u> works exactly like <u>MenuColorset</u>, but is used only for menu titles.

           <u>Translucent</u> controls a pseudo transparent effect that uses a image of the desktop under the menu as
           its background image. This option takes one value that is a number between 0 (fully translucent) and
           100 (not translucent), which is the percent of the translucency. Use <u>!Translucent</u> (or no additional
           value) to turn the effect off. The translucent effect only applies to normal menus and does not apply
           to "torn off" menus. Note, only the menu background is translucent, the <u>HilightBack</u> of the active
           item and <u>HilightTitleBack</u> of the title are not. To have a fully translucent menu use the following.

               MenuStyle * Translucent 60, !HilightBack, !HilightTitleBack, ActiveFore

           <u>Hilight3DThick</u>, <u>Hilight3DThin</u> and <u>Hilight3DOff</u> determine if the selected menu item is hilighted with
           a 3D relief. Thick reliefs are two pixels wide, thin reliefs are one pixel wide.

           <u>Hilight3DThickness</u> takes one numeric argument that may be between -50 and +50 pixels. With negative
           values the menu item gets a pressed in look. The above three commands are equivalent to a thickness
           of 2, 1 and 0.

           <u>Animation</u> and <u>!Animation</u> turn menu animation on or off. When animation is on, sub menus that do not
           fit on the screen cause the parent menu to be shifted to the left so the sub menu can be seen.

           <u>Font</u> and <u>TitleFont</u> take a font name as an argument. If a font by this name exists it is used for the
           text of all menu items. If it does not exist or if the name is left blank the built-in default is
           used. If a <u>TitleFont</u> is given, it is used for all menu titles instead of the normal font.

           <u>PopupDelay</u> requires one numeric argument. This value is the delay in milliseconds before a sub menu
           is popped up when the pointer moves over a menu item that has a sub menu. If the value is zero no
           automatic pop up is done. If the argument is omitted the built-in default is used. Note that the
           popup delay has no effect if the <u>PopupImmediately</u> option is used since sub menus pop up immediately
           then.

           <u>PopupImmediately</u> makes menu items with sub menus pop up it up as soon as the pointer enters the item.
           The <u>PopupDelay</u> <u>option</u> is ignored then. If <u>PopupDelayed</u> is used fvwm looks at the <u>PopupDelay</u> option if
           or when this automatic popup happens.

           <u>PopdownDelay</u> works exactly like <u>PopupDelay</u> but determines the timeout of the <u>PopupDelayed</u> style.

           <u>PopdownImmediately</u> makes sub menus vanish as soon as the pointer leaves the sub menu and the
           correspondent item in the parent menu. With the opposite option <u>PopdownDelayed</u> the sub menu only pops
           down after the time specified with the <u>PopdownDelay</u> option. This comes handy when the pointer often
           strays off the menu item when trying to move into the sub menu. Whenever there is a conflict between
           the <u>PopupImmediately</u>, <u>PopupDelayed</u>, <u>PopupDelay</u> styles and the <u>PopdownImmediately</u>, <u>PopdownDelayed</u>,
           <u>PopdownDelay</u> styles, the <u>Popup...</u> styles win when using mouse navigation and the <u>Popdown...</u> styles
           win when navigating with the keyboard.

           <u>PopupOffset</u> requires two integer arguments. Both values affect where sub menus are placed relative to
           the parent menu. If both values are zero, the left edge of the sub menu overlaps the left edge of the
           parent menu. If the first value is non-zero the sub menu is shifted that many pixels to the right (or
           left if negative). If the second value is non-zero the menu is moved by that many percent of the
           parent menuâ€™s width to the right or left.

           <u>PopupActiveArea</u> requires an integer value between 51 and 100. Normally, when the pointer is over a
           menu item with a sub menu and the pointer enters the area that starts at 75% of the menu width, the
           sub menu is shown immediately. This percentage can be changed with <u>PopupActiveArea</u>. Setting this
           value to 100 disables this kind of automatic popups altogether. The default value is restored if no
           or an invalid value is given.

           <u>TitleWarp</u> and <u>!TitleWarp</u> affect if the pointer warps to the menu title when a sub menu is opened or
           not. Note that regardless of this setting the pointer is not warped if the menu does not pop up under
           the pointer.

           <u>TitleUnderlines0</u>, <u>TitleUnderlines1</u> and <u>TitleUnderlines2</u> specify how many lines are drawn below a menu
           title.

           <u>SeparatorsLong</u> and <u>SeparatorsShort</u> set the length of menu separators. Long separators run from the
           left edge all the way to the right edge. Short separators leave a few pixels to the edges of the
           menu.

           <u>TrianglesSolid</u> and <u>TrianglesRelief</u> affect how the small triangles for sub menus is drawn. Solid
           triangles are filled with a color while relief triangles are hollow.

           <u>DoubleClickTime</u> requires one numeric argument. This value is the time in milliseconds between two
           mouse clicks in a menu to be considered as a double click. The default is 450 milliseconds. If the
           argument is omitted the double click time is reset to this default.

           <u>SidePic</u> takes the name of an image file as an argument. The picture is drawn along the left side of
           the menu. The <u>SidePic</u> option can be overridden by a menu specific side pixmap (see <b>AddToMenu</b>). If the
           file name is omitted an existing side pixmap is removed from the menu style.

           <u>SideColor</u> takes the name of an X11 color as an argument. This color is used to color the column
           containing the side picture (see above). The SideColor option can be overridden by a menu specific
           side color (see <b>AddToMenu</b>). If the color name is omitted the side color option is switched off.

           <u>PopupAsRootMenu</u>, <u>PopupAsSubmenu</u>, <u>PopupIgnore</u> and <u>PopupClose</u> change the behavior when you click on a
           menu item that opens a sub menu. With <u>PopupAsRootMenu</u> the original menu is closed before the sub menu
           appears, with <u>PopupAsSubmenu</u> it is not, so you can navigate back into the parent menu. Furthermore,
           with <u>PopupAsSubmenu</u> the sub menu is held open (posted) regardless of where you move the mouse.
           Depending on your menu style this may simplify navigating through the menu. <b>Any</b> keystroke while a
           menu is posted reverts the menu back to the normal behavior. With <u>PopupClose</u> the menu is closed when
           a sub menu item is activated, and the menu stays open if <u>PopupIgnore</u> is used (even if the menu was
           invoked with the <b>Popup</b> command). <u>PopupAsSubmenu</u> is the default.

           <u>RemoveSubmenus</u> instructs fvwm to remove sub menu when you move back into the parent menu. With
           <u>HoldSubmenus</u> the sub menu remains visible. You probably want to use <u>HoldSubmenus</u> if you are using the
           <u>PopupDelayed</u> style. <u>RemoveSubmenus</u> affects menu navigation with the keyboard.

           <u>SelectOnRelease</u> takes an optional key name as an argument. If the given key is released in a menu
           using this style, the current menu item is selected. This is intended for <b>WindowList</b> navigation. The
           key name is a standard X11 key name as defined in <u>/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h</u>, (without the <u>XK</u><b>_</b>
           prefix), or the keysym database <u>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XKeysymDB</u>. To disable this behavior, omit the key
           name.

           Note: Some X servers do not support KeyRelease events. <u>SelectOnRelease</u> does not work on such a
           machine.

           <u>ItemFormat</u> takes a special string as its argument that determines the layout of the menu items. Think
           of the format string as if it were a menu item. All you have to do is tell fvwm where to place the
           different parts of the menu item (i.e. the labels, the triangle denoting a sub menu, the mini icons
           and the side pic) in the blank area. The string consists of spaces,

           characters and formatting directives beginning with '%'. Any invalid characters and formatting
           directives are silently ignored:

           <b>%l</b>, <b>%c</b> and <b>%r</b>
               Insert the next item label. Up to three labels can be used. The item column is left-aligned (<b>%l</b>),
               centered (<b>%c</b>) or right-aligned (<b>%r</b>).

           <b>%i</b>
               Inserts the mini icon.

           <b>%&gt;</b> and <b>%&lt;</b>
               Insert the sub menu triangle pointing either to the right (<b>%&gt;</b>) or to the left (<b>%&lt;</b>).

           <b>%|</b>
               The first <b>%|</b> denotes the beginning of the area that is highlighted either with a background color
               or a relief (or both). The second <b>%|</b> marks the end of this area. <b>%|</b> can be used up to twice in
               the string. If you do not add one or both of them, fvwm sets the margins to the margins of the
               whole item (not counting the side picture).

           <b>%s</b>
               Places the side picture either at the beginning or the end of the menu. This directive may be
               used only once and only as the first or last in the format string. If the <b>%s</b> is not at the
               beginning of the string, menus are not drawn properly.

           <b>Space</b>, <b>Tab</b>, <b>%Space</b> and <b>%Tab</b>
               Add gap of one space, or a tab, using the width of the menu font. When using a tab, the size of
               the gap can be one to 8 spaces since the tab position is a multiple of 8 from the edge of the
               menu. The whole string must be quoted if spaces or tabs are used.

           <b>%p</b>
               Like Space and Tab <b>%p</b> inserts an empty area into the item, but with better control of its size
               (see below).

           You can define an additional space before and after each of the objects like this

               %left.rightp

           This means: if the object is defined in the menu (e.g. if it is <b>%s</b> and you use a side picture, or it
           is <b>%l</b> for the third column and there are items defined that actually have a third column), then add
           <u>left</u> pixels before the object and <u>right</u> pixels after it. You may leave out the <u>left</u> or the <u>.right</u>
           parts if you do not need them. All values up to the screen width are allowed. Even negative values
           can be used with care. The <b>p</b> may be replaced with any other formatting directives described above.

           Note: Only items defined in the format string are visible in the menus. So if you do not put a <b>%s</b> in
           there you do not see a side picture, even if one is specified.

           Note: The <u>SubmenusLeft</u> style changes the default <u>ItemFormat</u> string, but if it was set manually it is
           not modified.

           Note: If any unformatted title of the menu is wider than the widest menu item, the spaces between the
           different parts of the menu items are enlarged to match the width of the title. Leading left aligned
           objects in the format string (<b>%l</b>, <b>%i</b>, <b>%&lt;</b>, first <b>%|</b>) stick to the left edge of the menu and trailing
           right aligned objects (<b>%r</b>, <b>%i</b>, <b>%&gt;</b>, second <b>%|</b>) stick to the right edge. The gaps between the remaining
           items are enlarged equally.

           Examples:

               MenuStyle * ItemFormat "%.4s%.1|%.5i%.5l%.5l%.5r%.5i%2.3&gt;%1|"

           Is the default string used by fvwm: (side picture + 4 pixels gap) (beginning of the hilighted area +
           1 pixel gap) (mini icon + 5p) (first column left aligned + 5p) (second column left aligned + 5p)
           (third column right aligned + 5p) (second mini icon + 5p) (2p + sub menu triangle + 3p) (1p + end of
           hilighted area).

               MenuStyle * ItemFormat "%.1|%3.2&lt;%5i%5l%5l%5r%5i%1|%4s"

           Is used by fvwm with the <u>SubmenusLeft</u> option below.

           <u>VerticalItemSpacing</u> and <u>VerticalTitleSpacing</u> control the vertical spacing of menu items and titles
           like <u>ItemFormat</u> controls the horizontal spacing. Both take two numeric arguments that may range from
           -100 to +100. The first is the gap in pixels above a normal menu item (or a menu title), the second
           is the gap in pixels below it. Negative numbers do not make much sense and may screw up the menu
           completely. If no arguments are given or the given arguments are invalid, the built-in defaults are
           used: one pixel above the item or title and two below.

           <u>VerticalMargins</u> can be used to add some padding at the top and bottom of menus. It takes two numeric
           arguments that must be positive integers (or zero). If the number of arguments or its values are
           incorrect, fvwm defaults both to 0, which means no padding at all. If the values are correct, the
           first one is used for the top margin, and the second one is used for the bottom margin.

           <u>SubmenusLeft</u> mirrors the menu layout and behavior. Sub menus pop up to the left, the sub menu
           triangle is drawn left and the mini icon and side picture are drawn at the right side of the menu.
           The default is <u>SubmenusRight</u>. The position hints of a menu are also affected by this setting,
           i.e. position hints using <u>item</u> or <u>menu</u> as context rectangle and position hints using <u>m</u> offsets.

           <u>AutomaticHotkeys</u> and <u>!AutomaticHotkeys</u> control the menuâ€™s ability to automatically provide hot-keys
           on the first character of each menu itemâ€™s label. This behavior is always overridden if an explicit
           hot-key is assigned in the <b>AddToMenu</b> command.

           <u>UniqueHotkeyActivatesImmediate</u> and <u>!UniqueHotkeyActivatesImmediate</u> controls how menu items are
           invoked when used with hotkeys. By default, if a given menu entry only has one completeable match for
           a given hotkey, the action for that menu entry is invoked and the menu is closed. This is due to the
           <u>UniqueHotkeyActivatesImmediate</u> option. However, the menu can be told to remain open, waiting for the
           user to invoke the selected item instead when there is only one matched item for a given hotkey, by
           using the <u>!UniqueHotkeyActivatesImmediate</u> option.

           <u>MouseWheel</u> controls the ability to scroll the menu using a mouse wheel. It takes one argument, that
           can be one of ScrollsPointer, ScrollsMenu, ScrollsMenuBackwards or ActivatesItem. ScrollsPointer
           makes the mouse wheel scroll the pointer over a menu. This is the default. ScrollsMenu and
           ScrollsMenuBackwards scroll the menu beneath the pointer. ActivatesItem disables scrolling by mouse
           wheel and makes the use of a mouse wheel act as if the menu was clicked. If no argument is supplied
           the default setting is restored.

           <u>ScrollOffPage</u> allows a menu to be scrolled out of the visible area if <u>MouseWheel</u> is set to
           ScrollsMenu or ScrollsMenuBackwards. This is the default. The opposite, <u>!ScrollOffPage</u> disables this
           behaviour.

           <u>TrianglesUseFore</u> draws sub menu triangles with the foreground color of the menu colorset (normally
           drawn with the hilight color). <u>!TrianglesUseFore</u> disables this behaviour.

                                                   2025-02-22                                      <u><a href="../man1/FVWM3MENUS.1.html">FVWM3MENUS</a></u>(1)
