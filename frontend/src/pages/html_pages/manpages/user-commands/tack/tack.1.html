</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tack</b> - <u>terminfo</u> action checker

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tack</b> [-diltV] [term]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>tack</b> program has three purposes:

       (1) to help you build a new terminfo entry describing an unknown terminal,

       (2) to test the correctness of an existing entry, and

       (3) to  develop  the  correct  pad  timings  needed  to ensure that screen updates do not fall behind the
           incoming data stream.

       <b>Tack</b> presents a series of screen-painting and interactive tests in ways which are intended  to  make  any
       mismatches  between  the  terminfo entry and reality visually obvious.  <b>Tack</b> also provides tools that can
       help in understanding how the terminal operates.

   <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <u>-d</u>     Start <b>tack</b> with the debug-file “debug.log” opened.

       <u>-i</u>     Usually <b>tack</b> will send the reset and init strings to the terminal when the program starts up.  The
              <u>-i</u> option will inhibit the terminal initialization.

       <u>-l</u>     Start <b>tack</b> with the log-file “tack.log” opened.  This is also a menu item.

       <u>-t</u>     Tell <b>tack</b> to override the terminfo settings for basic terminal functions.   When  this  option  is
              set, <b>tack</b> will translate

              (cr) to \r,
              (cud1) to \n,
              (ind) to \n,
              (nel) to \r\n,
              (cub1) to \b,
              (bel) to \007,
              (ff) to \f and
              (ht) to \t.

       <u>-V</u>     Display the version information and exit.

       <u>term</u>   Terminfo  terminal name to be tested.  If not present, then the $TERM environment variable will be
              used.

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       Since <b>tack</b> is designed to test terminfo entries it is not possible to rely  on  the  correctness  of  the
       terminfo  data  base.  Because of this, the menuing system used with <b>tack</b> is very primitive.  When a menu
       is printed, it will scroll the entire screen.  To compensate for this verbose menu system,  <b>tack</b>  permits
       menu  selection  type ahead.  If you already know what action you would like <b>tack</b> to perform then you can
       enter that value immediately and avoid the menu display.  When in doubt the question mark (?) is  a  good
       character  to  type.   A  carriage  return  will  execute  the default action.  These default actions are
       designed to run all the standard tests.

       When <b>tack</b> first comes up it will display some basic information about the terminal.  Take  some  time  to
       verify this information.  If it is wrong many of the subsequent tests will fail.  The most important item
       is  the  screen  size.  If the screen size is wrong, there is no point in proceeding.  (home) and (clear)
       are also critical to the success of subsequent tests.  The values of  (cr)  (ind)  (cub1)  and  (ht)  may
       effect the tests if they are defined incorrectly.  If they are undefined <b>tack</b> will set them to reasonable
       defaults.   The  last  two entries on the display are the enquire and acknowledge strings.  These strings
       are taken from the user strings (u9) and (u8).

       By now you must be wondering why the terminfo names are enclosed in parenthesis.  This  has  no  profound
       meaning other than it makes them stand out.  The <b>tack</b> program uses this convention any time it displays a
       terminfo name.  Remember that <b>tack</b> is designed to rely on as little of the terminfo entry as possible.

</pre><h4><b>CREATING</b> <b>NEW</b> <b>ENTRIES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Tack</b>  has  a  number  of tools that are designed to help gather information about the terminal.  Although
       these functions are not dependent on terminal type, you may wish to execute <b>tack</b> with options <u>-it</u>.   This
       will turn off initialization and default the standard entries.

       These tools may be reached from the main menu by selecting the “tools” entry.

       <b>Echo</b> <b>tool</b>:  All data typed from the keyboard will be echoed back to the terminal.  Control characters are
       not  translated  to  the  up arrow format but are sent as control characters.  This allows you to test an
       escape sequence and see what it actually does.  You may also elect to <b>enable</b> <b>hex</b> <b>output</b> <b>on</b> <b>echo</b> <b>tool</b> this
       will echo the characters in hexadecimal.  Once the test is running you may enter the “lines” or “columns”
       keywords which will display a pattern that will help you determine your screen size.  A complete list  of
       keywords  will  be  displayed  when  the  test  starts.   Type  “help” to redisplay the list of available
       commands.

       <b>Reply</b> <b>tool</b>:  This tool acts much like the echo tool, but  control  characters  that  are  sent  from  the
       terminal  more  than  one character after a carriage return will be expanded to the up arrow format.  For
       example on a standard ANSI terminal you may type:

                 CR ESC [ c

       and the response will be echoed as something like:

                 ^[ [ ? 6 c

       <b>ANSI</b> <b>sgr</b> <b>display</b>:  This test assumes you have an ANSI terminal.  It goes through attribute numbers  0  to
       79, displaying each in turn and using that SGR number to write the text.  This shows you which of the SGR
       modes  are  actually implemented by the terminal.  Note: some terminals (such as Tektronix color) use the
       private use characters to augment the functionality of the SGR command.  These private use characters may
       be interjected into the escape sequence by typing the character ( &lt;, =, &gt;, ? ) after the original display
       has been shown.

       <b>ANSI</b> <b>status</b> <b>reports</b>:  This test queries the terminal in standard ANSI/VT-100  fashion.   The  results  of
       this test may help determine what options are supported by your terminal.

       <b>ANSI</b>  <b>character</b>  <b>sets</b>:   This test displays the character sets available on a ANSI/VT-100 style terminal.
       Character sets on a real VT-100 terminal are usually defined with smacs=\E(0 and rmacs=\E(B.   The  first
       character  after the escape defines the font bank.  The second character defines the character set.  This
       test allows you to view any of the possible combinations.  Private use character sets are defined by  the
       digits.  Standard character sets are located in the alphabetic range.

</pre><h4><b>VERIFYING</b> <b>AN</b> <b>EXISTING</b> <b>ENTRY</b></h4><pre>
       You  can verify the correctness of an entry with the “begin testing” function.  This entry is the default
       action and will be chosen if you hit carriage return (or enter).  This will bring  up  a  secondary  menu
       that allows you to select more specific tests.

       The general philosophy of the program is, for each capability, to send an appropriate test pattern to the
       terminal  then  send  a  description  of  what  the  user  should expect.  Occasionally (as when checking
       function-key capabilities) the program will ask you to enter input for it to check.

       If the test fails then you have the option of dynamically changing the terminfo entry and re-running  the
       test.   This  is  done  with  the  “edit  terminfo” menu item.  The edit submenu allows you to change the
       offending terminfo entry and immediately retest the capability.  The edit menu lets you do  other  things
       with  the  terminfo,  such as; display the entire terminfo entry, display which caps have been tested and
       display which caps cannot be tested.  This menu also allows you to write the newly modified  terminfo  to
       disc.   If you have made any modifications to the terminfo <b>tack</b> will ask you if you want to save the file
       to disc before it exits.  The filename will be the same as the terminal name.  After  the  program  exits
       you can run the <a href="../man1M/tic.1M.html">tic</a>(1M) compiler on the new terminfo to install it in the terminfo data base.

</pre><h4><b>CORRECTING</b> <b>PAD</b> <b>TIMINGS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>Overruns</b> <b>and</b> <b>Padding</b>
       Some  terminals  require  significant  amounts  of  time  (that  is,  more than one transmitted-character
       interval) to do screen updates that change large portions of the screen,  such  as  screen  clears,  line
       insertions,  line  deletions,  and  scrolls  (including scrolls triggered by line feeds or a write to the
       lowest, right-hand-most cell of the screen).

       If the computer continues to send characters to the terminal while one of these time-consuming operations
       is going on, the screen may be garbled.  Since  the  length  of  a  character  transmission  time  varies
       inversely  with  transmission  speed  in  cps, entries which function at lower speeds may break at higher
       speeds.

       Similar problems result if the host machine is simply sending characters at a sustained rate faster  than
       the  terminal  can  buffer  and  process them.  In either case, when the terminal cannot process them and
       cannot tell the host to stop soon enough, it will just drop them.  The dropped characters could be  text,
       escape sequences or the escape character itself, causing some really strange-looking displays.  This kind
       of glitch is called an <u>overrun</u>.

       In terminfo entries, you can attach a <u>pad</u> <u>time</u> to each string capability that is a number of milliseconds
       to delay after sending it.  This will give the terminal time to catch up and avoid overruns.

       If you are running a software terminal emulator, or you are on an X pseudo-tty, or your terminal is on an
       RS-232C line which correctly handles RTS/CTS hardware flow control, then pads are not strictly necessary.
       However,  some  display packages (such as <b><a href="../man3X/ncurses.3X.html">ncurses</a></b>(3X)) use the pad counts to calculate the fastest way to
       implement certain functions.  For example: scrolling the screen may be faster than deleting the top line.

       One common way to avoid overruns is with XON/XOFF handshaking.  But even this handshake may have problems
       at high baud rates.  This is a result of the way XON/XOFF works.  The terminal tells  the  host  to  stop
       with  an XOFF.  When the host gets this character, it stops sending.  However, there is a small amount of
       time between the stop request and the actual stop.  During this window, the  terminal  must  continue  to
       accept  characters  even though it has told the host to stop.  If the terminal sends the stop request too
       late, then its internal buffer will overflow.  If it  sends  the  stop  character  too  early,  then  the
       terminal  is  not  getting  the most efficient use out of its internal buffers.  In a real application at
       high baud rates, a terminal could get a  dozen  or  more  characters  before  the  host  gets  around  to
       suspending transmission.  Connecting the terminal over a network will make the problem much worse.

       (RTS/CTS  handshaking  does  not  have  this problem because the UARTs are signal-connected and the "stop
       flow" is done at the lowest level, without software intervention).

   <b>Timing</b> <b>your</b> <b>terminal</b>
       In order to get accurate timings from your terminal <b>tack</b> needs to know when  the  terminal  has  finished
       processing  all  the  characters  that were sent.  This requires a different type of handshaking than the
       XON/XOFF that is supported by most terminals.  <b>Tack</b> needs to send a request to the terminal and wait  for
       its  reply.   Many  terminals  will  respond with an ACK when they receive an ENQ.  This is the preferred
       method since the sequence is short.  ANSI/VT-100 style terminals can mimic this handshake with the escape
       sequence that requests “primary device attributes”.

          ESC [ c

       The terminal will respond with a sequence like:

          ESC [ ? 1 ; 0 c

       <b>Tack</b> assumes that (u9) is the enquire sequence and that (u8) is the acknowledge string.  A  VT-100  style
       terminal could set u9=\E[c and u8=\E[?1;0c.  Acknowledge strings fall into two categories.

       1)  Strings with a unique terminating character and,

       2)  strings of fixed length.

       The  acknowledge  string  for  the  VT-100 is of the first type since it always ends with the letter “c”.
       Some Tektronix terminals have fixed length acknowledge strings.  <b>Tack</b> supports both types of  strings  by
       scanning  for  the terminating character until the length of the expected acknowledge string has arrived.
       (u8) should be set to some typical acknowledge that will be returned when (u9) is sent.

       <b>Tack</b> will test this sequence before running any of the pad tests or the function key  tests.   <b>Tack</b>  will
       ask you the following:

           Hit lower case g to start testing...

       After  it  sends  this  message  it  will send the enquire string.  It will then read characters from the
       terminal until it sees the letter g.

   <b>Testing</b> <b>and</b> <b>Repairing</b> <b>Pad</b> <b>Timings</b>
       The pad timings in distributed terminfo entries are often  incorrect.   One  major  motivation  for  this
       program is to make it relatively easy to tune these timings.

       You can verify and edit the pad timings for a terminal with the “test string capabilities” function (this
       is also part of the “normal test sequence” function).

       The  key  to determining pad times is to find out the effective baud rate of the terminal.  The effective
       baud rate determines the number of characters per second that the  terminal  can  accept  without  either
       handshaking or losing data.  This rate is frequently less than the nominal cps rate on the RS-232 line.

       <b>Tack</b>  uses  the  effective  baud  rate to judge the duration of the test and how much a particular escape
       sequence will perturb the terminal.

       Each pad test has two associated variables that can be tweaked to help verify the correctness of the  pad
       timings.   One  is the pad test length.  The other is the pad multiplier, which is used if the pad prefix
       includes “*”.  In curses use, it is often the first parameter of the capability (if there is one).  For a
       capability like (dch) or (il) this  will  be  the  number  of  character  positions  or  lines  affected,
       respectively.

       <b>Tack</b>  will  run  the  pad  tests  and  display  the  results  to the terminal.  On capabilities that have
       multipliers <b>tack</b> will not tell you if the pad needs the multiplier or not.  You must make  this  decision
       yourself  by rerunning the test with a different multiplier.  If the padding changes in proportion to the
       multiplier than the multiplier is required.  If the multiplier has little or no effect on  the  suggested
       padding  then  the multiplier is not needed.  Some capabilities will take several runs to get a good feel
       for the correct values.  You may wish to make the test longer to get more accurate results.  System  load
       will  also  effect  the  results  (a heavily loaded system will not stress the terminal as much, possibly
       leading to pad timings that are too short).

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b></h4><pre>
       The tests done at the beginning of the program  are  assumed  to  be  correct  later  in  the  code.   In
       particular,  <b>tack</b> displays the number of lines and columns indicated in the terminfo entry as part of its
       initial output.  If these values are wrong a large number of tests will fail or give incorrect results.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       tack.log    If logging is enabled then all characters written to the terminal will also be written to the
                   log file.  This gives you the ability to see how the tests were performed.  This  feature  is
                   disabled by default.

       <u>term</u>        If  you  make  changes  to the terminfo entry <b>tack</b> will save the new terminfo to a file.  The
                   file will have the same name as the terminal name.
