       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pr — print files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       pr <b>[</b>+<u>page</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b>-<u>column</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b>-adFmrt<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-e<b>[</b><u>char</u><b>][</b><u>gap</u><b>]]</b> <b>[</b>-h <u>header</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b>-i<b>[</b><u>char</u><b>][</b><u>gap</u><b>]]</b>

           <b>[</b><u>file</u>...<b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>pr</u> utility is a printing and pagination filter. If multiple input files are specified, each shall be
       read, formatted, and written to standard output. By default, the input shall be  separated  into  66-line
       pages, each with:

        *  A 5-line header that includes the page number, date, time, and the pathname of the file

        *  A 5-line trailer consisting of blank lines

       If  standard  output  is  associated  with a terminal, diagnostic messages shall be deferred until the <u>pr</u>
       utility has completed processing.

       When options specifying multi-column output are specified, output text columns shall be of  equal  width;
       input  lines  that  do  not  fit into a text column shall be truncated. By default, text columns shall be
       separated with at least one &lt;blank&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>pr</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>12.2</u>, <u>Utility</u> <u>Syntax</u>
       <u>Guidelines</u>, except that: the <u>page</u> option has a <b>'+'</b> delimiter; <u>page</u> and <u>column</u> can be multi-digit numbers;
       some of the option-arguments are optional; and some  of  the  option-arguments  cannot  be  specified  as
       separate  arguments  from  the  preceding  option letter. In particular, the <b>-s</b> option does not allow the
       option letter to be separated from its argument, and the  options  <b>-e</b>,  <b>-i</b>,  and  <b>-n</b>  require  that  both
       arguments, if present, not be separated from the option letter.

       The  following  options  shall be supported. In the following option descriptions, <u>column</u>, <u>lines</u>, <u>offset</u>,
       <u>page</u>, and <u>width</u> are positive decimal integers; <u>gap</u> is a non-negative decimal integer.

       <b>+</b><u>page</u>     Begin output at page number <u>page</u> of the formatted input.

       <b>-</b><u>column</u>   Produce multi-column output that is arranged in <u>column</u> columns (the default shall be 1) and  is
                 written  down  each column in the order in which the text is received from the input file. This
                 option should not be used with <b>-m</b>.  The options <b>-e</b> and <b>-i</b> shall be assumed for  multiple  text-
                 column  output.  Whether  or  not  text columns are produced with identical vertical lengths is
                 unspecified, but a text column shall never exceed the length of the page (see the  <b>-l</b>  option).
                 When used with <b>-t</b>, use the minimum number of lines to write the output.

       <b>-a</b>        Modify  the  effect  of  the <b>-</b><u>column</u> option so that the columns are filled across the page in a
                 round-robin order (for example, when <u>column</u> is 2, the first input  line  heads  column  1,  the
                 second heads column 2, the third is the second line in column 1, and so on).

       <b>-d</b>        Produce output that is double-spaced; append an extra &lt;newline&gt; following every &lt;newline&gt; found
                 in the input.

       <b>-e[</b><u>char</u><b>][</b><u>gap</u><b>]</b>
                 Expand  each  input &lt;tab&gt; to the next greater column position specified by the formula <u>n</u>*<u>gap</u>+1,
                 where <u>n</u> is an integer &gt; 0. If <u>gap</u> is zero or is omitted, it  shall  default  to  8.  All  &lt;tab&gt;
                 characters in the input shall be expanded into the appropriate number of &lt;space&gt; characters. If
                 any non-digit character, <u>char</u>, is specified, it shall be used as the input &lt;tab&gt;.  If the first
                 character  of the <b>-e</b> option-argument is a digit, the entire option-argument shall be assumed to
                 be <u>gap</u>.

       <b>-f</b>        Use a &lt;form-feed&gt; for new pages, instead of the  default  behavior  that  uses  a  sequence  of
                 &lt;newline&gt;  characters.  Pause  before  beginning  the  first  page  if  the  standard output is
                 associated with a terminal.

       <b>-F</b>        Use a &lt;form-feed&gt; for new pages, instead of the  default  behavior  that  uses  a  sequence  of
                 &lt;newline&gt; characters.

       <b>-h</b> <u>header</u> Use the string <u>header</u> to replace the contents of the <u>file</u> operand in the page header.

       <b>-i[</b><u>char</u><b>][</b><u>gap</u><b>]</b>
                 In  output,  replace  &lt;space&gt;  characters  with  &lt;tab&gt; characters wherever one or more adjacent
                 &lt;space&gt; characters reach column positions <u>gap</u>+1, 2* <u>gap</u>+1, 3* <u>gap</u>+1, and so on. If <u>gap</u> is  zero
                 or  is  omitted,  default tab settings at every eighth column position shall be assumed. If any
                 non-digit character, <u>char</u>, is specified, it shall be used as the output &lt;tab&gt;.   If  the  first
                 character  of the <b>-i</b> option-argument is a digit, the entire option-argument shall be assumed to
                 be <u>gap</u>.

       <b>-l</b> <u>lines</u>  Override the 66-line default and reset the page length to <u>lines</u>.  If <u>lines</u> is not greater  than
                 the  sum  of  both the header and trailer depths (in lines), the <u>pr</u> utility shall suppress both
                 the header and trailer, as if the <b>-t</b> option were in effect.

       <b>-m</b>        Merge files. Standard output shall be formatted so the <u>pr</u> utility writes  one  line  from  each
                 file  specified  by  a  <u>file</u>  operand, side by side into text columns of equal fixed widths, in
                 terms of the number of column positions. Implementations shall support merging of at least nine
                 <u>file</u> operands.

       <b>-n[</b><u>char</u><b>][</b><u>width</u><b>]</b>
                 Provide <u>width</u>-digit line numbering (default for <u>width</u> shall be 5). The number shall occupy  the
                 first  <u>width</u>  column positions of each text column of default output or each line of <b>-m</b> output.
                 If <u>char</u> (any non-digit character) is given, it shall be appended to the line number to separate
                 it from whatever follows (default for <u>char</u> is a &lt;tab&gt;).

       <b>-o</b> <u>offset</u> Each line of output shall be preceded by offset &lt;space&gt; characters. If the  <b>-o</b>  option  is  not
                 specified,  the default offset shall be zero. The space taken is in addition to the output line
                 width (see the <b>-w</b> option below).

       <b>-p</b>        Pause before beginning each page if the standard output is directed to  a  terminal  (<u>pr</u>  shall
                 write an &lt;alert&gt; to standard error and wait for a &lt;carriage-return&gt; to be read on <b>/dev/tty</b>).

       <b>-r</b>        Write no diagnostic reports on failure to open files.

       <b>-s[</b><u>char</u><b>]</b>  Separate  text  columns  by  the  single character <u>char</u> instead of by the appropriate number of
                 &lt;space&gt; characters (default for <u>char</u> shall be &lt;tab&gt;).

       <b>-t</b>        Write neither the five-line identifying header nor the five-line trailer usually  supplied  for
                 each  page.  Quit  writing  after  the last line of each file without spacing to the end of the
                 page.

       <b>-w</b> <u>width</u>  Set the width of the line to <u>width</u> column positions for multiple text-column  output  only.  If
                 the  <b>-w</b>  option is not specified and the <b>-s</b> option is not specified, the default width shall be
                 72. If the <b>-w</b> option is not specified and the <b>-s</b> option is specified, the default  width  shall
                 be 512.

                 For single column output, input lines shall not be truncated.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <u>file</u>      A  pathname of a file to be written. If no <u>file</u> operands are specified, or if a <u>file</u> operand is
                 <b>'-'</b>, the standard input shall be used.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       The standard input shall be used only if no <u>file</u> operands are specified, or if a  <u>file</u>  operand  is  <b>'-'</b>.
       See the INPUT FILES section.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The input files shall be text files.

       The file <b>/dev/tty</b> shall be used to read responses required by the <b>-p</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>pr</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>8.2</u>,  <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files) and
                 which  characters  are  defined as printable (character class <b>print</b>).  Non-printable characters
                 are still written to standard output, but are not counted for the purpose for column-width  and
                 line-length calculations.

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used  to affect the format and contents of diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>LC_TIME</u>   Determine the format of the date and time for use in writing header lines.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

       <u>TZ</u>        Determine the timezone used to calculate date and time strings written in header lines.  If  <u>TZ</u>
                 is unset or null, an unspecified default timezone shall be used.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       If <u>pr</u> receives an interrupt while writing to a terminal, it shall flush all accumulated error messages to
       the screen before terminating.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>pr</u> utility output shall be a paginated version of the original file (or files). This pagination shall
       be  accomplished using either &lt;form-feed&gt; characters or a sequence of &lt;newline&gt; characters, as controlled
       by the <b>-F</b> or <b>-f</b> option. Page headers shall be generated unless the  <b>-t</b>  option  is  specified.  The  page
       headers shall be of the form:

           "\n\n%s %s Page %d\n\n\n", &lt;<u>output</u> <u>of</u> <u>date</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>file</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>page</u> <u>number</u>&gt;

       In  the  POSIX locale, the &lt;<u>output</u> <u>of</u> <u>date</u>&gt; field, representing the date and time of last modification of
       the input file (or the current date and time if the input file is standard input), shall be equivalent to
       the output of the following command as it would appear if executed at the given time:

           date "+%b %e %H:%M %Y"

       without the trailing &lt;newline&gt;, if the page being written is from  standard  input.  If  the  page  being
       written is not from standard input, in the POSIX locale, the same format shall be used, but the time used
       shall  be  the  modification time of the file corresponding to <u>file</u> instead of the current time. When the
       <u>LC_TIME</u> locale category is not set to the POSIX locale, a different format and order of  presentation  of
       this field may be used.

       If  the  standard  input  is used instead of a <u>file</u> operand, the &lt;<u>file</u>&gt; field shall be replaced by a null
       string.

       If the <b>-h</b> option is specified, the &lt;<u>file</u>&gt; field shall be replaced by the <u>header</u> argument.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used for diagnostic messages  and  for  alerting  the  terminal  when  <b>-p</b>  is
       specified.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       A conforming application must protect its first operand, if it starts with a &lt;plus-sign&gt;, by preceding it
       with  the <b>"--"</b> argument that denotes the end of the options. For example, <u>pr</u>+<u>x</u> could be interpreted as an
       invalid page number or a <u>file</u> operand.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
        1. Print a numbered list of all files in the current directory:

               ls -a | pr -n -h "Files in $(pwd)."

        2. Print <b>file1</b> and <b>file2</b> as a double-spaced, three-column listing headed by ``file list'':

               pr -3d -h "file list" file1 file2

        3. Write <b>file1</b> on <b>file2</b>, expanding tabs to columns 10, 19, 28, ...:

               pr -e9 -t &lt;file1 &gt;file2

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       This utility is one of those that does not follow the Utility Syntax Guidelines because of its historical
       origins. The standard developers could have added new options that obeyed the guidelines (and marked  the
       old  options  obsolescent) or devised an entirely new utility; there are examples of both actions in this
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017. Because of its widespread use by historical applications, the standard developers
       decided to exempt this version of <u>pr</u> from many of the guidelines.

       Implementations are required to accept option-arguments to  the  <b>-h</b>,  <b>-l</b>,  <b>-o</b>,  and  <b>-w</b>  options  whether
       presented  as  part  of  the  same  argument or as a separate argument to <u>pr</u>, as suggested by the Utility
       Syntax Guidelines. The <b>-n</b> and <b>-s</b> options, however, are specified as in historical practice  because  they
       are  frequently  specified without their optional arguments. If a &lt;blank&gt; were allowed before the option-
       argument in these cases, a <u>file</u>  operand  could  mistakenly  be  interpreted  as  an  option-argument  in
       historical applications.

       The  text  about  the  minimum  number of lines in multi-column output was included to ensure that a best
       effort is made in balancing the length of the columns. There  are  known  historical  implementations  in
       which,  for  example,  60-line  files  are  listed  by <u>pr</u> -2 as one column of 56 lines and a second of 4.
       Although this is not a problem when a full page with headers  and  trailers  is  produced,  it  would  be
       relatively useless when used with <b>-t</b>.

       Historical  implementations  of  the  <u>pr</u> utility have differed in the action taken for the <b>-f</b> option. BSD
       uses it as described here for the <b>-F</b> option; System V uses it to change trailing &lt;newline&gt; characters  on
       each  page  to  a &lt;form-feed&gt; and, if standard output is a TTY device, sends an &lt;alert&gt; to standard error
       and reads a line from <b>/dev/tty</b> before the first page. There were strong arguments from both sides of this
       issue concerning historical practice and as a result the <b>-F</b>  option  was  added.  XSI-conformant  systems
       support the System V historical actions for the <b>-f</b> option.

       The  &lt;<u>output</u> <u>of</u> <u>date</u>&gt; field in the <b>-l</b> format is specified only for the POSIX locale. As noted, the format
       can be different in other locales.  No  mechanism  for  defining  this  is  present  in  this  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017, as the appropriate vehicle is a message catalog; that is, the format should be specified as
       a ``message''.
