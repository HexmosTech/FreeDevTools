</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       whiff - like which, but finds the first of all the given alternatives

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.008

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>which</u> is a useful utility, found on most unix systems.  It gives you the absolute path for the first
       occurrence of a program in your path.  Unfortunately, it does two stupid things:  first, if it can't find
       one, it prints an error message to stdout; secondly, if you give it multiple arguments, it assumes you
       want one line per argument, each like calling which individually.

       <u>whiff</u> assumes that all the arguments form a best-first list of alternatives, and only prints the path to
       the first alternative found in the path.  If none is found, it prints an error (to stderr!) and exits
       with an error code.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl
       released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
