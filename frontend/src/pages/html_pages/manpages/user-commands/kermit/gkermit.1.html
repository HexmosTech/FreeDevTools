</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gkermit - G-Kermit (GNU Kermit) 1.00 file transfer software.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       gkermit [ options ] -s file(s)    Send files
       gkermit [ options ] -g file(s)    Get files
       gkermit [ options ] -r            Receive files

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       G-Kermit  is  a  UNIX  program  for  transferring  files using the Kermit
       protocol.   G-Kermit  is  a  product  of  Kermit  Project   at   Columbia
       University.   It  is free software under the GNU Public License.  See the
       COPYING file for details.

   <b>INVOKING</b> <b>G-KERMIT</b>
       The G-Kermit binary is called "gkermit".  It should be  stored  someplace
       in  your  UNIX  PATH; normally it is available as /usr/local/bin/gkermit.
       To run G-Kermit, just type "gkermit"  followed  by  command-line  options
       that  tell  it  what  to  do.  If no options are given, it prints a usage
       message listing the available options.

       If an option takes an argument, the argument is required;  if  an  option
       does not take an argument, no argument may be given (exception: -d).  The
       action  options are -r, -s, and -g.  Only one action option may be given.
       If no action options are given, G-Kermit does nothing (except possibly to
       print its usage message or create  a  debug.log  file).   Here  are  some
       examples ("$ " is the shell prompt):

         $ gkermit -s hello.c   &lt;-- Send the hello.c file
         $ gkermit -s hello.*   &lt;-- Send all hello.* files
         $ gkermit -r           &lt;-- Wait to receive files
         $ gkermit -g hello.c   &lt;-- Get hello.c file
         $ gkermit -g hello.\*  &lt;-- Get all hello.* files

       Options  that  do not take arguments can be "bundled" with other options.
       An option that takes an argument must always be followed by a  space  and
       then its argument(s).  Examples:

         $ gkermit -is hello.o  &lt;-- Send hello.o in binary mode
         $ gkermit -dr          &lt;-- Receive with debugging

   <b>COMMAND-LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
         -r      RECEIVE.  Wait for incoming files.
         -s fn   SEND.  Send file(s) specified by fn.
         -g fn   GET.  Get specified file(s) from server.
         -a fn   AS-NAME.  Alternative name for file.
         -i      IMAGE.  Binary-mode transfer (default).
         -T      TEXT. Text-mode transfer.
         -P      PATH (filename) conversion disabled.
         -w      WRITEOVER when filenames collide.
         -K      KEEP incompletely received files.
         -p x    PARITY. x = e,o,m,s,n; default = n(one).
         -e n    PACKET LENGTH.  n = 40-9000; default=4000.
         -b n    TIMEOUT.  Per-packet timeout, seconds.
         -x      XON/XOFF.  Set Xon/Xoff in the tty driver.
         --x     Unset Xon/Xoff in the tty driver.
         -S      STREAMING disabled.
         -X      EXTERNAL.  G-Kermit is an external protocol.
         -q      QUIET.  Suppress messages.
         -d      DEBUG.  Write debugging info to ./debug.log.
         -d fn   DEBUG.  Write debugging info to given file.
         -h      HELP.  Display brief usage message.

       You  may  supply  options  to G-Kermit on the command line or through the
       GKERMIT  environment  variable,  which  can  contain  any  valid  gkermit
       command-line options.  These are processed before the actual command-line
       options and so can be overridden by them.  Example for bash or ksh, which
       you  can put in your profile if you want to always keep incomplete files,
       suppress streaming, suppress messages, and use Space parity:

         export GKERMIT="-K -S -q -p s"

   <b>MECHANICS</b> <b>OF</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>TRANSFER</b>
       To transfer files with G-Kermit you must be connected through a  terminal
       emulator  to  the  UNIX system where G-Kermit is running, meaning you are
       online to UNIX and have access to the shell prompt (or to a menu that has
       an option to invoke G-Kermit).  The connection can be serial  (direct  or
       dialed) or network (Telnet, Rlogin, X.25, etc).

       When you tell G-Kermit to SEND a file (or files), e.g. with:

         $ gkermit -Ts oofa.txt

       it  pauses  for  a  second and then sends its first packet.  What happens
       next depends on the capabilities of your terminal emulator:

          • If  your  emulator  supports  Kermit  "autodownloads"  then  it
            receives  the  file  automatically  and  puts  you  back in the
            terminal screen when done.

          • Otherwise, you'll need to take whatever action is  required  by
            your emulator to get its attention: a mouse action, a keystroke
            like  Alt-x,  or  a  character  sequence  like Ctrl-\ or Ctrl-]
            followed by the letter "c" (this is called "escaping back") and
            then tell it  to  receive  the  file.   When  the  transfer  is
            complete,  you  must  instruct  your emulator to go back to its
            terminal screen.

       During file transfer, most terminal emulators put up some kind of running
       display of the file transfer progress.

       When you tell G-Kermit to RECEIVE (with "gkermit -r"), this requires  you
       to  escape  back  to  your  terminal emulator and instruct it to send the
       desired file(s).

       If your terminal emulator supports Kermit autodownloads AND Kermit server
       mode, then you can use GET ("gkermit -g files...")  rather  than  RECEIVE
       ("gkermit  -r"),  and the rest happens automatically, as when G-Kermit is
       sending.

   <b>INTERRUPTING</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>TRANSFER</b>
       G-Kermit  supports  file  and  group  interruption.    The   method   for
       interrupting  a transfer depends on your terminal emulator.  For example,
       while the file-transfer display is active, you might type the letter  'x'
       to  cancel  the  current file and go on to the next one (if any), and the
       letter 'z' to cancel the group.  Or there might be buttons you can  click
       with your mouse.

       When  G-Kermit  is  in  packet  mode and your terminal emulator is in its
       terminal screen, you can also type three (3) Ctrl-C characters in  a  row
       to make G-Kermit exit and restore the normal terminal modes.

   <b>TEXT</b> <b>AND</b> <b>BINARY</b> <b>TRANSFER</b> <b>MODE</b>
       When  sending  files in binary mode, G-Kermit sends every byte exactly as
       it is stored on the disk.  This mode is appropriate for program binaries,
       graphics files, tar archives, compressed files, etc,  and  is  G-Kermit's
       default  file transfer mode when sending.  When receiving files in binary
       mode, G-Kermit simply copies each byte to disk.  (Obviously the bytes are
       encoded for transmission, but the encoding and decoding procedures give a
       replica of the original file after transfer.)

       When sending files in text mode, G-Kermit converts the record  format  to
       the  common  one  that  is  defined for the Kermit protocol, namely lines
       terminated by carriage return and linefeed (CRLF); the receiver  converts
       the CRLFs to whatever line-end or record-format convention is used on its
       platform.   When  receiving  files  in  text mode, G-Kermit simply strips
       carriage returns, leaving only a linefeed at the end of each line,  which
       is the UNIX convention.

       When  receiving  files,  the  sender's  transfer  mode  (text  or binary)
       predominates if the sender gives this information to G-Kermit in a Kermit
       File Attribute packet, which of course depends on whether  your  terminal
       emulator's Kermit protocol has this feature.  Otherwise, if you gave a -i
       or -T option on the gkermit command line, the corresponding mode is used;
       otherwise the default mode (binary) is used.

       Furthermore, when either sending or receiving, G-Kermit and your terminal
       emulator's  Kermit  can  inform  each  other of their OS type (UNIX in G-
       Kermit's case).  If your emulator  supports  this  capability,  which  is
       called  "automatic  peer  recognition",  and  it  tells G-Kermit that its
       platform is also UNIX, G-Kermit and the emulator's  Kermit  automatically
       switch  into  binary mode, since no record-format conversion is necessary
       in this case.  Automatic peer recognition is  disabled  automatically  if
       you include the -i (image) or -T (text) option.

       When  sending, G-Kermit sends all files in the same mode, text or binary.
       There is no automatic per-file mode switching.  When receiving,  however,
       per-file  switching  occurs automatically based on the incoming Attribute
       packets, if any (explained below), that accompany each file.

   <b>PATHNAMES</b>
       When SENDING a file, G-Kermit obtains  the  filenames  from  the  command
       line.   It  depends  on the shell to expand metacharacters (wildcards and
       tilde).

       G-Kermit uses the full pathname given to find and open the file, but then
       strips the pathname  before  sending  the  name  to  the  receiver.   For
       example:

         $ gkermit -s <a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a>

       results  in  the  receiver  getting a file called "HOSTS" or "hosts" (the
       directory part, "<a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a>", is stripped).

       However, if a pathname is included in the -a option, the  directory  part
       is not stripped:

         $ gkermit -s <a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a> -a /tmp/hosts

       This  example  sends  the <a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a> file but tells the receiver that its
       name is "/tmp/hosts".  What the receiver does with the  pathname  is,  of
       course,  up to the receiver, which might have various options for dealing
       with incoming pathnames.

       When RECEIVING a file, G-Kermit does NOT  strip  the  pathname.   If  the
       incoming  filename  includes  a path, G-Kermit tries to store the file in
       the specified place.  If the path does not  exist,  the  transfer  fails.
       The incoming pathname can, of course, be overridden with the -a option.

   <b>FILENAME</b> <b>CONVERSION</b>
       When  sending  a  file,  G-Kermit normally converts outbound filenames to
       common form: uppercase, no more than one period, and no funny characters.
       So, for example, gkermit.tar.gz would be sent as GKERMIT_TAR.GZ.

       When receiving a file, if the name is all uppercase, G-Kermit converts it
       to all lowercase.  If the name contains any lowercase  letters,  G-Kermit
       leaves the name alone.

       If  the  automatic  peer recognition feature is available in the terminal
       emulator, and G-Kermit recognizes the emulator's  platform  as  UNIX,  G-
       Kermit  automatically  disables filename conversion and sends and accepts
       filenames literally.

       You can force literal filenames by including the -P option on the command
       line.

   <b>FILENAME</b> <b>COLLISIONS</b>
       When G-Kermit receives a file whose name  is  the  same  as  that  of  an
       existing  file,  G-Kermit "backs up" the existing file by adding a unique
       suffix to its name.  The suffix is ".~n~", where n  is  a  number.   This
       kind  of  backup  suffix  is  compatible with GNU EMACS and various other
       popular applications.

       To defeat the backup feature and have incoming files  overwrite  existing
       files  of the same name, include the -w (writeover) option on the command
       line.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       G-Kermit resturns an exit status code of 0 if all actions succeeded and 1
       if any actions failed.

</pre><h4><b>IMPLEMENTATION</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       G-Kermit is designed to be small, portable, and stable, and  is  intended
       for  use  only  on  the  "far  end"  of  a  connection;  it does not make
       connections itself, although it can be used as an  external  protocol  by
       other programs that do make connections.  To keep it small and stable, it
       does  not  include  sliding  windows,  a command or scripting language or
       character-set translation.  To keep it portable and stable, it avoids use
       of system services that are not standardized across  all  UNIX  varieties
       and  therefore, in particular, does not support file timestamps, internal
       wildcard  expansion,  and  other  features  that  are   not   implemented
       consistently (or at all) across all UNIXes.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       A  GKERMIT environment variable may be defined (for example in your shell
       profile) to include G-Kermit command-line options; these are processed by
       G-Kermit before any options that are specified on the command  line,  and
       therefore are overriden by command-line options.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       If an error occurs during file transfer G-Kermit sends an error packet to
       your  terminal  emulator  to  cancel  the  transfer; an appropriate error
       message should be displayed on your screen.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       File transfers can fail for a number of reasons:

          • Lack of read access to a source file.
          • Lack of write access to a target directory.
          • Lack of adequate flow control.
          • Use of streaming on an unreliable connection.
          • Excessive unprefixing of control characters.
          • Sending bare 8-bit data on a 7-bit connection.
          • Packets too long for receiver's buffers.
          • Timeout interval too short for connection.

       and many others; these are covered in the references.

</pre><h4><b>REFERENCES</b></h4><pre>
       The Kermit protocol is specified in "Kermit, A File Transfer Protocol" by
       Frank da Cruz, Digital Press (1987).  A correctness proof of  the  Kermit
       protocol  appears  in  "Specification  and Validation Methods", edited by
       Egon Boerger, Oxford University Press (1995).  "Using C-Kermit" by  Frank
       da  Cruz and Christine M. Gianone, Digital Press (1997, or later edition)
       explains many of the terms and techniques referenced here in case you are
       not  familiar  with  them,  and   also   includes   tutorials   on   data
       communications,  extensive  troubleshooting  and  performance  tips, etc.
       Various other books on Kermit are available from Digital  Press.   Online

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The speed of a file transfer depends not only on the  speed  of  the  two
       computers involved and the characteristics of the connection, but also on
       the capabilities and configuration of the two Kermit programs.  Kermit is
       a  fast  and  reliable  protocol,  but  not all implementations of it are
       necessarily fast or reliable.

       Nonstreaming transfers on a TCP/IP connection might be inordinately  slow
       if one or both of the TCP/IP stacks uses the Nagle or Delayed ACK tricks.
       Streaming is used automatically if the other Kermit supports it.

       When  receiving files in text mode, G-Kermit strips all carriage returns,
       even if they aren't followed by linefeed.

       A backups files are not guaranteed to have the highest  number  in  their
       backup suffix.
