</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       vlna - adds tilde after each non-syllabic preposition

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vlna</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>filenames</u>]

</pre><h4><b>PREFACE</b></h4><pre>
       There exists a special Czech and Slovak typographical rule: you cannot leave the non-syllabic preposition
       on  the  end  of  one line and continue writing text on next line. For example, you cannot write down the
       text "v lese" (in a forest) like "v&lt;new-line&gt;lese". The program vlna adds  the  asciitilde  between  such
       preposition  and the next word and removes the space(s) in this place.  It means, the program converts "v
       lese" to "v~lese". You can use this program as a  preporcessor  before  TeXing.  Moreower,  you  can  set
       another sequence to store instead asciitilte (see the <b>-x</b> option).

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The program <b>vlna</b> processes one or more files, searches the non-syllabic prepositions followed by space(s)
       in these files and converts this/these space(s) to asciitilde for each such occurrence.

       In the processed file, the activity of the program can be blocked by <b>%~-</b> sequence and the activity can be
       restored  again  by the <b>%~+</b> sequence. These sequences can include spaces, it means that <b>%</b> <b>~-</b> is a correct
       sequence too.

       The rule to recognize a preposition follows: The arbitrary number of opening parentheses can  be  written
       before  the preposition and before these (optional) parentheses must be the space, tabelator or new-line.
       The preposition itself is one-letter word, the letters have to be from this  set:  {KkSsVvZzOoUuAI}.  See
       the  <b>-v</b>  option  if  you  want  to  change this set of letters. From version 1.2, the TeX sequence can be
       written before preposition and before the brace. Example: "&lt;new-line&gt;([V lese"  is  converted  to  "&lt;new-
       line&gt;([V~lese".  Another example: "\uv{V lese}" is converted to "\uv{V~lese}".

       One  or  more  blank-spaces have to be included after preposition before next word. The blank-space means
       space or tabelator.  One &lt;new-line&gt; can be here too.  All these characters are removed  and  replaced  by
       asciitilde (or by another string, see <b>-x</b> option). If &lt;new-line&gt; is deleted, another &lt;new-line&gt; is created
       before  preposition  (and before optional parentheses) in order to the number of lines is kept unchanged.
       Example: "... V&lt;new-line&gt;&lt;tabelator&gt;lese" is converted to "...&lt;new-line&gt;V~lese".

       The program checks the consintence of TeX's math environments (if <b>-m</b> option isn't used). For example  the
       "$...$$...$"  sequence  (it means the display mode switch inside the text-math mode) generates a warning.
       Empty line inside display mode generates a warning too and the program processes next text like in normal
       (non-math) mode. The existence of the "$" inside display mode are accepted because the constructions like
       $$..\hbox{..$..$}..$$ are allowed and common.

       The consistence of verbatim mode is checked on the end of the file.  If the file ends  but  the  verbatim
       mode does not end the warning is printed.  This behavior can be switched off by <b>-n</b> or <b>-w</b> options.

       The  program  suppresses the tilde changing after letters like prepositions but they are not prepositions
       because the <b>\TeX</b> or <b>\LaTeX</b> sequence precedes. Example: "vlastnosti \TeX  u  jsou"  is  not  converted  to
       "vlastnosti  \TeX  u~jsou",  because  this  text  is printed (after TeX processing) like "vlastnosti TeXu
       jsou". The letter "u" is a suffix here, no preposition.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The options are optional and can be written in arbitrarty order separated by space.

       <b>-f</b>     Filter. The [<u>filenames</u>] are treated as follows:

              <b>vlna</b> <b>-f</b> <u>filename1</u> <u>filename2</u>
                  Input is <u>filename1</u>, output is <u>filename2</u>.

              <b>vlna</b> <b>-f</b> <u>filename1</u>
                  Input is <u>filename1</u>, output is <u>stdout</u>.

              <b>vlna</b> <b>-f</b>
                  Input is <u>stdin</u>, output is <u>stdout</u>.

              <b>vlna</b> <u>filename1</u> [<u>filename2</u> [<u>filename3</u> ...]]
                  If the <b>-f</b> option is omitted then each file is processed independently and it is re-written.

       <b>-s</b>     The silent mode. No messages, warnings, statistics are printed.  Only errors which terminates  the
              program  untimely  are printed.  If this parameter is omitted then banner, warnings and statistics
              are printed to <u>stderr</u>.

       <b>-r</b>     Do not create the backups. The option <b>-r</b> is irrelevant if the <b>-f</b> option is used. If the <b>-f</b> and  <b>-r</b>
              options  aren't  used  then  each re-written file is stored with its original contents to a backup
              file (the name of backup file is the same as filename, only the tilde is used instead of the  last
              character).

       <b>-v</b> <u>characters</u>
              The  set  of  characters treated as non-syllabic prepositions is declared by this option. Default:
              <b>-v</b> <b>KkSsVvZzOoUuAI</b>.  The space between <b>-v</b> and <u>characters</u> is required.

       <b>-x</b> <u>code</u>
              The <u>code</u> is a string written in hexadecimal notation (even hexa digits is required).  This  string
              will  be  saved  after prepositions instead asciitilde which is default.  The example: <b>-x</b> <b>C2A0</b> two
              bytes are stored after each non-syllabic preposition, first byte has C2 code and second  byte  has
              A0  code. This example means that NO-BREAK SPACE in UTF8 encoding will be used after prepositions.
              Another example: <b>-x</b> <b>00A0</b> the NO-BREAK SPACE in UTF16 encoding.  Another example: <b>-x</b> <b>48454C4C4F</b> the
              string HELLO will be used.  The space between <b>-x</b> and <u>code</u> is required.

       <b>-m</b>     The math-modes (<b>$</b>...<b>$</b> and <b>$$</b>...<b>$$</b>) are  ignored.   It  means  that  non-syllabic  prepositions  is
              searched in math-mode too.  Default (without <b>-m</b> option): no changes in math modes are done because
              (for example) "v" is variable in math-mode, no preposition.

       <b>-n</b>     The  verbatim mode (<b>\verb</b><u>&lt;char&gt;</u>...<u>&lt;char&gt;</u>, <b>\begtt</b>...<b>\endtt</b>) is ignored, it means the program can do
              a changes in verbatim environment.  Default (without <b>-n</b> option): no changes in verbatim  mode  are
              done.

       <b>-l</b>     The    LaTeX    mode.    The    following    environments    are    treated   as   display   mode:
              <b>\begin{display}</b>...<b>\end{display}</b>   and   <b>\begin{equation}</b>...<b>\end{equation}</b>   and   the    following
              environment is treated as verbatim mode: <b>\begin{verbatim}</b>...<b>\end{verbatim}</b>.

       <b>-w</b>     The  web  mode  (Knuth's  web,  no  www:-).  The  following sequences are treated as verbatim: <b>@&lt;</b>,
              <b>@d</b>...<b>@*</b>, <b>@</b><u>space</u> or <b>@&gt;|</b>.  It means program code is unchanged in  *.w  or  *.web  files,  only  web-
              comments are processed.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vlna</b> <b>-m</b> <b>-n</b> <b>-s</b> <b>-r</b> <u>file</u>
              The program has a behavior similar to the old <b>vlnka</b> program.

       <b>vlna</b> <b>*.tex</b>
              All files with .tex suffix in current directory will be processed (and possibly changed). (The "*"
              is UNIX-shell feautre).

       <b>vlna</b> <b>-f</b> <b>file</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>/dev/null</b>
              Only the consistence checking of math and verbatim modes is processed.  No changes are done.
