</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       The  GNU  implementation  of  <u>tbl</u>  is part of the <u><a href="../man1/groff.1.html">groff</a></u>(1) document formatting system.  <u>tbl</u> is a <u><a href="../man1/troff.1.html">troff</a></u>(1)
       preprocessor that translates descriptions of tables embedded in <u><a href="../man7/roff.7.html">roff</a></u>(7) input  files  into  the  language
       understood  by  <u>troff</u>.   It  copies  the contents of each <u>file</u> to the standard output stream, except that
       lines between <b>.TS</b> and <b>.TE</b> are interpreted as table descriptions.  While GNU <u>tbl</u>'s input syntax is  highly
       compatible  with AT&amp;T <u>tbl</u>, the output GNU <u>tbl</u> produces cannot be processed by AT&amp;T <u>troff</u>; GNU <u>troff</u> (or a
       <u>troff</u> implementing any GNU extensions employed) must be used.  Normally, <u>tbl</u> is not executed directly  by
       the  user,  but  invoked  by  specifying the <b>-t</b> option to <u><a href="../man1/groff.1.html">groff</a></u>(1).  If no <u>file</u> operands are given on the
       command line, or if <u>file</u> is “<b>-</b>”, <u>tbl</u> reads the standard input stream.

   <b>Overview</b>
       <u>tbl</u> expects to find table descriptions between input lines that begin with  <b>.TS</b>  (table  start)  and  <b>.TE</b>
       (table  end).   Each  such  <u>table</u> <u>region</u> encloses one or more table descriptions.  Within a table region,
       table descriptions beyond the first must each be preceded by an input  line  beginning  with  <b>.T&amp;</b>.   This
       mechanism  does not start a new table region; all table descriptions are treated as part of their <b>.TS</b>/<b>.TE</b>
       enclosure, even if they are boxed or have column headings that repeat on subsequent pages (see below).

       (Experienced <u>roff</u> users should observe that <u>tbl</u> is not a <u>roff</u> language interpreter: the  default  control
       character  must  be used, and no spaces or tabs are permitted between the control character and the macro
       name.  These <u>tbl</u> input tokens remain as-is in the output, where they become ordinary macro calls.   Macro
       packages  often  define  <b>TS</b>,  <b>T&amp;</b>,  and  <b>TE</b>  macros  to handle issues of table placement on the page.  <u>tbl</u>
       produces <u>groff</u> code to define these macros as empty if their definitions do not exist when the  formatter
       encounters a table region.)

       Each  table  region  may  begin with <u>region</u> <u>options,</u> and must contain one or more <u>table</u> <u>definitions;</u> each
       table definition contains a <u>format</u> <u>specification</u> followed by one or more input lines (rows)  of  <u>entries.</u>
       These entries comprise the <u>table</u> <u>data.</u>

   <b>Region</b> <b>options</b>
       The  line  immediately  following  the  <b>.TS</b> token may specify region options, keywords that influence the
       interpretation or rendering of the region as a whole or all table  entries  within  it  indiscriminately.
       They  must  be  separated by commas, spaces, or tabs.  Those that require a parenthesized argument permit
       spaces and tabs between the option's name and the opening parenthesis.  Options accumulate and cannot  be
       unset within a region once declared; if an option that takes a parameter is repeated, the last occurrence
       controls.  If present, the set of region options must be terminated with a semicolon (<b>;</b>).

       Any  of  the  <b>allbox</b>, <b>box</b>, <b>doublebox</b>, <b>frame</b>, and <b>doubleframe</b> region options makes a table “boxed” for the
       purpose of later discussion.

       <b>allbox</b> Enclose each table entry in a box; implies <b>box</b>.

       <b>box</b>    Enclose the entire table region in a box.  As a GNU extension, the alternative option  name  <b>frame</b>
              is also recognized.

       <b>center</b> Center the table region with respect to the current indentation and line length; the default is to
              left-align it.  As a GNU extension, the alternative option name <b>centre</b> is also recognized.

       <b>decimalpoint(</b><u>c</u><b>)</b>
              Recognize  character  <u>c</u>  as the decimal separator in columns using the <b>N</b> (numeric) classifier (see
              subsection “Column classifiers” below).  This is a GNU extension.

       <b>delim(</b><u>xy</u><b>)</b>
              Recognize characters <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> as start and end delimiters,  respectively,  for  <u><a href="../man1/eqn.1.html">eqn</a></u>(1)  input,  and
              ignore input between them.  <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> need not be distinct.

       <b>doublebox</b>
              Enclose the entire table region in a double box; implies <b>box</b>.  As a GNU extension, the alternative
              option name <b>doubleframe</b> is also recognized.

       <b>expand</b> Spread  the  table  horizontally  to  fill  the available space (line length minus indentation) by
              increasing column separation.   Ordinarily,  a  table  is  made  only  as  wide  as  necessary  to
              accommodate  the  widths of its entries and its column separations (whether specified or default).
              When <b>expand</b> applies to a table that exceeds the available horizontal space, column  separation  is
              reduced  as far as necessary (even to zero).  <u>tbl</u> produces <u>groff</u> input that issues a diagnostic if
              such compression occurs.  The column modifier <b>x</b> (see below) overrides this option.

       <b>linesize(</b><u>n</u><b>)</b>
              Draw lines or rules (e.g., from <b>box</b>) with a thickness of <u>n</u> points.  The  default  is  the  current
              type size when the region begins.  This option is ignored on terminal devices.

       <b>nokeep</b> Don't  use  <u>roff</u> diversions to manage page breaks.  Normally, <u>tbl</u> employs them to avoid breaking a
              page within a table row.  This usage can sometimes interact badly with macro packages' own use  of
              diversions—when footnotes, for example, are employed.  This is a GNU extension.

       <b>nospaces</b>
              Ignore leading and trailing spaces in table entries.  This is a GNU extension.

       <b>nowarn</b> Suppress  diagnostic  messages  produced at document formatting time when the line or page lengths
              are inadequate to contain a table row.  This is a GNU extension.

       <b>tab(</b><u>c</u><b>)</b> Use the character <u>c</u> instead of a tab to separate entries in a row of table data.

   <b>Table</b> <b>format</b> <b>specification</b>
       The table format specification is mandatory: it determines the number of columns in the table and directs
       how the entries within it are to be typeset.  The format specification is a series of column <u>descriptors.</u>
       Each descriptor encodes a <u>classifier</u> followed  by  zero  or  more  <u>modifiers.</u>   Classifiers  are  letters
       (recognized  case-insensitively)  or  punctuation  symbols; modifiers consist of or begin with letters or
       numerals.  Spaces, tabs, newlines, and commas separate descriptors.  Newlines  and  commas  are  special;
       they  apply  the  descriptors  following  them  to  a  subsequent row of the table.  (This enables column
       headings to be centered or emboldened while the table entries for the data are not,  for  instance.)   We
       term  the  resulting  group  of column descriptors a <u>row</u> <u>definition.</u>  Within a row definition, separation
       between column descriptors (by spaces or tabs) is often optional; only some modifiers,  described  below,
       make separation necessary.

       Each  column  descriptor begins with a mandatory <u>classifier,</u> a character that selects from one of several
       arrangements.  Some determine the positioning of table entries within a rectangular cell: centered, left-
       aligned, numeric (aligned to a configurable decimal  separator),  and  so  on.   Others  perform  special
       operations  like drawing lines or spanning entries from adjacent cells in the table.  Except for “<b>|</b>”, any
       classifier can be followed by one or more <u>modifiers;</u> some of these accept an argument, which in  GNU  <u>tbl</u>
       can  be  parenthesized.   Modifiers  select  fonts,  set the type size, and perform other tasks described
       below.

       The format specification can occupy multiple input lines, but must conclude with a dot “<b>.</b>” followed by  a
       newline.   Each  row  definition  is applied in turn to one row of the table.  The last row definition is
       applied to rows of table data in excess of the row definitions.

       For clarity in this document's examples, we  shall  write  classifiers  in  uppercase  and  modifiers  in
       lowercase.   Thus,  “<b>CbCb,LR.</b>” defines two rows of two columns.  The first row's entries are centered and
       boldfaced; the second and any further rows'  first  and  second  columns  are  left-  and  right-aligned,
       respectively.

       The  row  definition  with the most column descriptors determines the number of columns in the table; any
       row definition with fewer is implicitly extended on the right-hand side with <b>L</b> classifiers as many  times
       as necessary to make the table rectangular.

   <b>Column</b> <b>classifiers</b>
       The <b>L</b>, <b>R</b>, and <b>C</b> classifiers are the easiest to understand and use.

       <b>A</b>, <b>a</b>   Center  longest  entry  in this column, left-align remaining entries in the column with respect to
              the centered entry, then indent all entries by one en.  Such “alphabetic” entries (hence the  name
              of  the classifier) can be used in the same column as <b>L</b>-classified entries, as in “<b>LL,AR.</b>”.  The <b>A</b>
              entries are often termed “sub-columns” due to their indentation.

       <b>C</b>, <b>c</b>   Center entry within the column.

       <b>L</b>, <b>l</b>   Left-align entry within the column.

       <b>N</b>, <b>n</b>   Numerically align entry in the column.  <u>tbl</u> aligns columns of  numbers  vertically  at  the  units
              place.   If  multiple  decimal  separators  are adjacent to a digit, it uses the rightmost one for
              vertical alignment.  If there is no decimal separator, the rightmost digit is  used  for  vertical
              alignment;  otherwise, <u>tbl</u> centers the entry within the column.  The <u>roff</u> dummy character <b>\&amp;</b> in an
              entry marks the glyph preceding it (if any) as the units place; if multiple instances occur in the
              data, the leftmost is used for alignment.

              If <b>N</b>-classified entries share a column with <b>L</b> or <b>R</b> entries, <u>tbl</u> centers the widest  <b>N</b>  entry  with
              respect  to  the  widest  <b>L</b> or <b>R</b> entry, preserving the alignment of <b>N</b> entries with respect to each
              other.

              The appearance of <u>eqn</u> equations  within  <b>N</b>-classified  columns  can  be  troublesome  due  to  the
              foregoing  textual  scan  for a decimal separator.  Use the <b>delim</b> region option to make <u>tbl</u> ignore
              the data within <u>eqn</u> delimiters for that purpose.

       <b>R</b>, <b>r</b>   Right-align entry within the column.

       <b>S</b>, <b>s</b>   Span previous entry on the left into this column.

       <b>^</b>      Span entry in the same column from the previous row into this row.

       <b>_</b>, <b>-</b>   Replace table entry with a horizontal rule.  An empty table entry is  expected  to  correspond  to
              this classifier; if data are found there, <u>tbl</u> issues a diagnostic message.

       <b>=</b>      Replace table entry with a double horizontal rule.  An empty table entry is expected to correspond
              to this classifier; if data are found there, <u>tbl</u> issues a diagnostic message.

       <b>|</b>      Place  a vertical rule (line) on the corresponding row of the table (if two of these are adjacent,
              a double vertical rule).  This classifier does not contribute to the column  count  and  no  table
              entries  correspond  to it.  A <b>|</b> to the left of the first column descriptor or to the right of the
              last one produces a vertical rule at the edge of the table; these are redundant (and  ignored)  in
              boxed tables.

       To change the table format within a <u>tbl</u> region, use the <b>.T&amp;</b> token at the start of a line.  It is followed
       by a format specification and table data, but <u>not</u> region options.  The quantity of columns in a new table
       format  thus introduced cannot increase relative to the previous table format; in that case, you must end
       the table region and start another.  If that will not serve because the region uses box  options  or  the
       columns align in an undesirable manner, you must design the initial table format specification to include
       the maximum quantity of columns required, and use the <b>S</b> horizontal spanning classifier where necessary to
       achieve the desired columnar alignment.

       Attempting  to  horizontally  span  in  the first column or vertically span on the first row is an error.
       Non-rectangular span areas are also not supported.

   <b>Column</b> <b>modifiers</b>
       Any number of modifiers can follow a column classifier.  Arguments  to  modifiers,  where  accepted,  are
       case-sensitive.   If the same modifier is applied to a column specifier more than once, or if conflicting
       modifiers are applied, only the last occurrence has effect.  The modifier <b>x</b> is mutually exclusive with  <b>e</b>
       and  <b>w</b>,  but <b>e</b> is not mutually exclusive with <b>w</b>; if these are used in combination, <b>x</b> unsets both <b>e</b> and <b>w</b>,
       while either <b>e</b> or <b>w</b> overrides <b>x</b>.

       <b>b</b>, <b>B</b>   Typeset entry in boldface, abbreviating <b>f(B)</b>.

       <b>d</b>, <b>D</b>   Align a vertically spanned table entry to the bottom (“down”),  instead  of  the  center,  of  its
              range.  This is a GNU extension.

       <b>e</b>, <b>E</b>   Equalize  the  widths  of columns with this modifier.  The column with the largest width controls.
              This modifier sets the default line length used in a text block.

       <b>f</b>, <b>F</b>   Select the typeface for the table entry.  This modifier must be followed by a font or  style  name
              (one  or  two characters not starting with a digit), font mounting position (a single digit), or a
              name or mounting position of any length in parentheses.  The last form is a GNU  extension.   (The
              parameter  corresponds to that accepted by the <u>troff</u> <b>ft</b> request.)  A one-character argument not in
              parentheses must be separated by one or more spaces or tabs from what follows.

       <b>i</b>, <b>I</b>   Typeset entry in an oblique or italic face, abbreviating <b>f(I)</b>.

       <b>m</b>, <b>M</b>   Call a <u>groff</u> macro before typesetting a text block (see subsection “Text blocks” below).  This  is
              a  GNU  extension.   This  modifier must be followed by a macro name of one or two characters or a
              name of any length in parentheses.   A  one-character  macro  name  not  in  parentheses  must  be
              separated by one or more spaces or tabs from what follows.  The named macro must be defined before
              the  table  region  containing this column modifier is encountered.  The macro should contain only
              simple <u>groff</u> requests to change text formatting, like adjustment or  hyphenation.   The  macro  is
              called <u>after</u> the column modifiers <b>b</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>p</b>, and <b>v</b> take effect; it can thus override other column
              modifiers.

       <b>p</b>, <b>P</b>   Set  the  type  size  for the table entry.  This modifier must be followed by an integer <u>n</u> with an
              optional leading sign.  If unsigned, the type size is set to <u>n</u> scaled points.  Otherwise, the type
              size is incremented or decremented per the sign by <u>n</u> scaled points.  The use of  a  signed  multi-
              digit  number  is  a  GNU  extension.  (The parameter corresponds to that accepted by the <u>troff</u> <b>ps</b>
              request.)  If a type size modifier is followed by a column separation modifier (see  below),  they
              must be separated by at least one space or tab.

       <b>t</b>, <b>T</b>   Align a vertically spanned table entry to the top, instead of the center, of its range.

       <b>u</b>, <b>U</b>   Move the column up one half-line, “staggering” the rows.  This is a GNU extension.

       <b>v</b>, <b>V</b>   Set  the  vertical  spacing  to  be  used  in  a text block.  This modifier must be followed by an
              integer <u>n</u> with an optional leading sign.  If unsigned, the vertical spacing is set  to  <u>n</u>  points.
              Otherwise,  the  vertical spacing is incremented or decremented per the sign by <u>n</u> points.  The use
              of a signed multi-digit number is a GNU extension.  (This parameter corresponds to  that  accepted
              by  the  <u>troff</u>  <b>vs</b>  request.)   If  a vertical spacing modifier is followed by a column separation
              modifier (see below), they must be separated by at least one space or tab.

       <b>w</b>, <b>W</b>   Set the column's minimum width.  This modifier must be followed by a number,  which  is  either  a
              unitless  integer,  or  a <u>roff</u> horizontal measurement in parentheses.  Parentheses are required if
              the width is to be followed immediately by an explicit column  separation  (alternatively,  follow
              the  width  with  one  or  more  spaces or tabs).  If no unit is specified, ens are assumed.  This
              modifier sets the default line length used in a text block.

       <b>x</b>, <b>X</b>   Expand the column.  After computing the column widths, distribute any remaining line length evenly
              over all columns bearing this modifier.  Applying the <b>x</b> modifier to more than one column is a  GNU
              extension.  This modifier sets the default line length used in a text block.

       <b>z</b>, <b>Z</b>   Ignore  the  table  entries  corresponding to this column for width calculation purposes; that is,
              compute the column's width using only the information in its descriptor.

       <u>n</u>      A numeric suffix on a column descriptor sets the separation distance (in ens) from the  succeeding
              column;  the default separation is <b>3n</b>.  This separation is proportionally multiplied if the <b>expand</b>
              region option is in effect; in the case  of  tables  wider  than  the  output  line  length,  this
              separation  might  be zero.  A negative separation cannot be specified.  A separation amount after
              the last column in a row is nonsensical and provokes a diagnostic from <u>tbl</u>.

   <b>Table</b> <b>data</b>
       The table data come after the format specification.  Each input line corresponds to a table  row,  except
       that  a  backslash  at  the end of a line of table data continues an entry on the next input line.  (Text
       blocks, discussed below, also spread table entries across multiple input lines.)  Table entries within  a
       row  are  separated  in the input by a tab character by default; see the <b>tab</b> region option above.  Excess
       entries in a row of table data (those that have no corresponding column descriptor, not even an  implicit
       one  arising from rectangularization of the table) are discarded with a diagnostic message.  <u>roff</u> control
       lines are accepted between rows of table data and within text blocks.  If you wish  to  visibly  mark  an
       empty  table  entry in the document source, populate it with the <b>\&amp;</b> <u>roff</u> dummy character.  The table data
       are interrupted by a line consisting of the <b>.T&amp;</b> input token, and conclude with the line <b>.TE</b>.

       Ordinarily, a table entry is typeset rigidly.   It  is  not  filled,  broken,  hyphenated,  adjusted,  or
       populated  with additional inter-sentence space.  <u>tbl</u> instructs the formatter to measure each table entry
       as it occurs in the input, updating the width required by its corresponding column.  If  the  <b>z</b>  modifier
       applies  to  the  column,  this measurement is ignored; if <b>w</b> applies and its argument is larger than this
       width, that argument is used instead.  In contrast to conventional <u>roff</u> input (within a paragraph,  say),
       changes to text formatting, such as font selection or vertical spacing, do not persist between entries.

       Several forms of table entry are interpreted specially.

       • If  a table row contains only an underscore or equals sign (<b>_</b> or <b>=</b>), a single or double horizontal rule
         (line), respectively, is drawn across the table at that point.

       • A table entry containing only <b>_</b> or <b>=</b> on an otherwise populated row is replaced by a  single  or  double
         horizontal rule, respectively, joining its neighbors.

       • Prefixing  a  lone  underscore  or  equals  sign  with  a backslash also has meaning.  If a table entry
         consists only of <b>\_</b> or <b>\=</b> on an otherwise  populated  row,  it  is  replaced  by  a  single  or  double
         horizontal rule, respectively, that does <u>not</u> (quite) join its neighbors.

       • A  table  entry  consisting  of  <b>\R</b><u>x</u>, where <u>x</u> is any <u>roff</u> ordinary or special character, is replaced by
         enough repetitions of the glyph corresponding to <u>x</u> to fill  the  column,  albeit  without  joining  its
         neighbors.

       • On  any  row but the first, a table entry of <b>\^</b> causes the entry above it to span down into the current
         one.

       On occasion, these special tokens may be required as literal table data.  To use either <b>_</b> or <b>=</b>  literally
       and  alone  in an entry, prefix or suffix it with the <u>roff</u> dummy character <b>\&amp;</b>.  To express <b>\_</b>, <b>\=</b>, or <b>\R</b>,
       use a <u>roff</u> escape sequence to interpolate the backslash (<b>\e</b> or <b>\[rs]</b>).  A reliable way to emplace the  <b>\^</b>
       glyph  sequence  within  a  table  entry  is  to  use  a pair of <u>groff</u> special character escape sequences
       (<b>\[rs]\[ha]</b>).

       Rows of table entries can be interleaved with <u>groff</u> control lines; these do not count as table data.   On
       such  lines  the  default  control  character  (<b>.</b>)  must  be used (and not changed); the no-break control
       character is not recognized.  To start the first table entry in a row with a dot,  precede  it  with  the
       <u>roff</u> dummy character <b>\&amp;</b>.

   <b>Text</b> <b>blocks</b>
       An  ordinary  table  entry's  contents  can make a column, and therefore the table, excessively wide; the
       table then exceeds the line length of the page, and becomes ugly or  is  exposed  to  truncation  by  the
       output  device.  When a table entry requires more conventional typesetting, breaking across more than one
       output line (and thereby increasing the height of its row), it can be placed within a <u>text</u> <u>block.</u>

       <u>tbl</u> interprets a table entry beginning with “<b>T{</b>” at the end of an input line not as table data, but as  a
       token  starting  a  text block.  Similarly, “<b>T}</b>” at the start of an input line ends a text block; it must
       also end the table entry.  Text block tokens can share an input line with other table data (preceding  <b>T{</b>
       and  following <b>T}</b>).  Input lines between these tokens are formatted in a diversion by <u>troff</u>.  Text blocks
       cannot be nested.  Multiple text blocks can occur in a table row.

       Text blocks are formatted as was the text prior to the table, modified by applicable column  descriptors.
       Specifically,  the  classifiers  <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>R</b>, and <b>S</b> determine a text block's <u>alignment</u> within its cell,
       but not its <u>adjustment.</u>  Add <b>na</b> or <b>ad</b> requests to the beginning of a text block to alter  its  adjustment
       distinctly  from  other  text  in the document.  As with other table entries, when a text block ends, any
       alterations to formatting parameters are discarded.  They do not affect  subsequent  table  entries,  not
       even other text blocks.

       If  <b>w</b>  or <b>x</b> modifiers are not specified for <u>all</u> columns of a text block's span, the default length of the
       text block (more precisely, the line length used to process the text  block  diversion)  is  computed  as
       <u>L</u>×<u>C</u>/(<u>N</u>+1),  where  <u>L</u> is the current line length, <u>C</u> the number of columns spanned by the text block, and <u>N</u>
       the number of columns in the table.  If necessary, you can also control a text block's width by including
       an <b>ll</b> (line length) request in it prior to any text to be formatted.  Because  a  diversion  is  used  to
       format  the  text  block,  its  height  and  width are subsequently available in the registers <b>dn</b> and <b>dl</b>,
       respectively.

   <u><b>roff</b></u> <b>interface</b>
       The register <b>TW</b> stores the width of the table region in basic units; it can't be used within  the  region
       itself,  but is defined before the <b>.TE</b> token is output so that a <u>groff</u> macro named <b>TE</b> can make use of it.
       <b>T.</b> is a Boolean-valued register indicating whether the bottom of the table is being  processed.   The  <b>#T</b>
       register marks the top of the table.  Avoid using these names for any other purpose.

       <u>tbl</u>  also  defines  a  macro  <b>T#</b> to produce the bottom and side lines of a boxed table.  While <u>tbl</u> itself
       arranges for the output to include a call of this macro at the end of such a table, it can also  be  used
       by  macro  packages  to create boxes for multi-page tables by calling it from a page footer macro that is
       itself called by a trap planted near the bottom of the page.  See section “Limitations” below for more on
       multi-page tables.

       GNU <u>tbl</u> internally employs register, string, macro, and diversion names beginning with the numeral <b>3</b>.   A
       document to be preprocessed with GNU <u>tbl</u> should not use any such identifiers.

   <b>Interaction</b> <b>with</b> <u><b>eqn</b></u>
       <u>tbl</u> should always be called before <u><a href="../man1/eqn.1.html">eqn</a></u>(1).  (<u><a href="../man1/groff.1.html">groff</a></u>(1) automatically arranges preprocessors in the correct
       order.)   Don't call the <b>EQ</b> and <b>EN</b> macros within tables; instead, set up delimiters in your <u>eqn</u> input and
       use the <b>delim</b> region option so that <u>tbl</u> will recognize them.

   <b>GNU</b> <u><b>tbl</b></u> <b>enhancements</b>
       In addition to extensions noted above, GNU <u>tbl</u> removes constraints endured by users of AT&amp;T <u>tbl</u>.

       • Region options can be specified in any lettercase.

       • There is no limit on the number of columns in a table, regardless  of  their  classification,  nor  any
         limit on the number of text blocks.

       • All  table  rows  are considered when deciding column widths, not just those occurring in the first 200
         input lines of a region.  Similarly, table continuation (<b>.T&amp;</b>) tokens are recognized outside a  region's
         first 200 input lines.

       • Numeric and alphabetic entries may appear in the same column.

       • Numeric and alphabetic entries may span horizontally.

   <b>Using</b> <b>GNU</b> <u><b>tbl</b></u> <b>within</b> <b>macros</b>
       You  can  embed  a  table  region  inside  a  macro  definition.  However, since <u>tbl</u> writes its own macro
       definitions at the beginning of each table region, it is necessary to call end macros instead  of  ending
       macro definitions with “<b>..</b>”.  Additionally, the escape character must be disabled.

       Not  all  <u>tbl</u>  features can be exercised from such macros because <u>tbl</u> is a <u>roff</u> preprocessor: it sees the
       input earlier than <u>troff</u> does.  For example, vertically aligning decimal separators fails if the  numbers
       containing them occur as macro or string parameters; the alignment is performed by <u>tbl</u> itself, which sees
       only  <b>\$1</b>, <b>\$2</b>, and so on, and therefore can't recognize a decimal separator that only appears later when
       <u>troff</u> interpolates a macro or string definition.

       Using <u>tbl</u> macros within conditional input (that is, contingent upon an <b>if</b>, <b>ie</b>, <b>el</b>, or <b>while</b> request)  can
       result in misleading line numbers in subsequent diagnostics.  <u>tbl</u> unconditionally injects its output into
       the  source document, but the conditional branch containing it may not be taken, and if it is not, the <b>lf</b>
       requests that <u>tbl</u> injects to restore the source line number cannot take  effect.   Consider  copying  the
       input  line  counter  register  <b>c.</b>  and  restoring  its  value  at a convenient location after applicable
       arithmetic.

</pre><h4><b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--help</b> displays a usage message, while <b>-v</b> and <b>--version</b> show version information; all exit afterward.

       <b>-C</b>     Enable AT&amp;T compatibility mode: recognize <b>.TS</b> and <b>.TE</b> even when followed by a character other than
              space or newline.  Furthermore, interpret the uninterpreted leader escape sequence <b>\a</b>.

</pre><h4><b>Limitations</b></h4><pre>
       Multi-page tables, if boxed and/or if you want their column headings repeated after page breaks,  require
       support  at  the  time  the  document  is  formatted.   A convention for such support has arisen in macro
       packages such as <u>ms</u>, <u>mm</u>, and <u>me</u>.  To use it, follow the <b>.TS</b> token with a space and then “<b>H</b>”; this will be
       interpreted by the formatter as a <b>TS</b> macro call with an <b>H</b> argument.  Then, within the  table  data,  call
       the  <b>TH</b>  macro; this informs the macro package where the headings end.  If your table has no such heading
       rows, or you do not desire their repetition, call <b>TH</b> immediately after the  table  format  specification.
       If  a  multi-page  table  is  boxed or has repeating column headings, do not enclose it with keep/release
       macros, or divert it in any other way.  Further, the <b>bp</b> request will not cause a page break in a  “<b>TS</b>  <b>H</b>”
       table.   Define a macro to wrap <b>bp</b>: invoke it normally if there is no current diversion.  Otherwise, pass
       the macro call to the enclosing diversion using the  transparent  line  escape  sequence  <b>\!</b>;  this  will
       “bubble up” the page break to the output device.  See section “Examples” below for a demonstration.

       Double  horizontal  rules  are  not  supported  by <u><a href="../man1/grotty.1.html">grotty</a></u>(1); single rules are used instead.  <u>grotty</u> also
       ignores half-line motions, so the <b>u</b> column modifier has no effect.  On terminal devices  (“<u>nroff</u>  mode”),
       horizontal rules and box borders occupy a full vee of space; this amount is doubled for <b>doublebox</b> tables.
       Tables  using  these features thus require more vertical space in <u>nroff</u> mode than in <u>troff</u> mode: write <b>ne</b>
       requests accordingly.  Vertical rules between columns are drawn in the space  between  columns  in  <u>nroff</u>
       mode;  using  double vertical rules and/or reducing the column separation below the default can make them
       ugly or overstrike them with table data.

       A text block within a table must be able to fit on one page.

       Using <b>\a</b> to put leaders in table entries does not work in GNU <u>tbl</u>, except in compatibility mode.  This is
       correct behavior: <b>\a</b> is an <u>uninterpreted</u> leader.  You can still use the <u>roff</u> leader character (Control+A)
       or define a string to use <b>\a</b> as it was designed: to be interpreted only in copy mode.

       A leading and/or trailing <b>|</b> in a format specification, such as “<b>|LCR|.</b>”, produces an en space between the
       vertical rules and the content of the adjacent columns.  If no such space is desired (so  that  the  rule
       abuts  the content), you can introduce “dummy” columns with zero separation and empty corresponding table
       entries before and/or after.

              .TS

              #levulose#glucose#dextrose#
              _
              .TE

       These dummy columns have zero width and are therefore invisible; unfortunately they usually don't work as
       intended on terminal devices.
