</pre><h4><b>Intent</b></h4><pre>
       The goal of Tippecanoe is to enable making a scale-independent view of your data, so that  at  any  level
       from the entire world to a single building, you can see the density and texture of the data rather than a
       simplification from dropping supposedly unimportant features or clustering or aggregating them.

       If  you give it all of OpenStreetMap and zoom out, it should give you back something that looks like "All
       Streets ⟨<a href="http://benfry.com/allstreets/map5.html">http://benfry.com/allstreets/map5.html</a>⟩" rather than something that  looks  like  an  Interstate
       road atlas.

       If  you  give  it all the building footprints in Los Angeles and zoom out far enough that most individual
       buildings are no longer discernable, you  should  still  be  able  to  see  the  extent  and  variety  of
       development in every neighborhood, not just the largest downtown buildings.

       If you give it a collection of years of tweet locations, you should be able to see the shape and relative
       popularity of every point of interest and every significant travel corridor.

</pre><h4><b>Installation</b></h4><pre>
       The easiest way to install tippecanoe on OSX is with Homebrew ⟨<a href="http://brew.sh/">http://brew.sh/</a>⟩:

              $ brew install tippecanoe

       On Ubuntu it will usually be easiest to build from the source repository:

              $ git clone https://github.com/felt/tippecanoe.git
              $ cd tippecanoe
              $ make -j
              $ make install

       See  Development  ⟨#development⟩  below  for  how  to  upgrade  your C++ compiler or install prerequisite
       packages if you get compiler errors.

</pre><h4><b>Usage</b></h4><pre>
              $ tippecanoe -o file.mbtiles [options] [file.json file.json.gz file.fgb ...]

       If no files are specified, it reads GeoJSON from the standard input.  If multiple  files  are  specified,
       each is placed in its own layer ⟨#input-files-and-layer-names⟩.

       The  GeoJSON  features  need not be wrapped in a FeatureCollection.  You can concatenate multiple GeoJSON
       features or files together, and it will parse out the features  and  ignore  whatever  other  objects  it
       encounters.

</pre><h4><b>Try</b> <b>this</b> <b>first</b></h4><pre>
       If you aren't sure what options to use, try this:

              $ tippecanoe -zg -o out.mbtiles --drop-densest-as-needed in.geojson

       The <b>-zg</b> option will make Tippecanoe choose a maximum zoom level that should be high enough to reflect the
       precision of the original data. (If it turns out still not to be as detailed as you want, use <b>-z</b> manually
       with a higher number.)

       If the tiles come out too big, the <b>--drop-densest-as-needed</b> option will make Tippecanoe try dropping what
       should be the least visible features at each zoom level.  (If it drops too many features, use <b>-x</b> to leave
       out some feature attributes that you didn't really need.)

</pre><h4><b>Examples</b></h4><pre>
       Create  a  tileset  of  TIGER  roads  for  Alameda County, to zoom level 13, with a custom layer name and
       description:

              $ tippecanoe -o alameda.mbtiles -l alameda -n "Alameda County from TIGER" -z13 tl_2014_06001_roads.json

       Create a tileset of all TIGER roads, at only zoom level 12, but with higher detail than  normal,  with  a
       custom layer name and description, and leaving out the <b>LINEARID</b> and <b>RTTYP</b> attributes:

              $ cat tiger/tl_2014_*_roads.json | tippecanoe -o tiger.mbtiles -l roads -n "All TIGER roads, one zoom" -z12 -Z12 -d14 -x LINEARID -x RTTYP

       The <b>-z11</b> option explicitly specifies the maxzoom, to make sure both the old and  new  tilesets  have  the

       The  <b>-j</b>  option  to <b>tile-join</b> specifies a filter, so that only the desired features will be copied to the
       new tileset.  This filter excludes (using <b>none</b>) any features whose FIPS code (<b>COUNTYFP00</b>) is the code for
       Alameda County (<b>001</b>).

</pre><h4><b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       There are a lot of options. A lot of the  time  you  won't  want  to  use  any  of  them  other  than  <b>-o</b>
       <u>output</u><b>.mbtiles</b>  to name the output file, and probably <b>-f</b> to delete the file that already exists with that
       name.

       If you aren't sure what the right maxzoom is for your data, <b>-zg</b> will guess  one  for  you  based  on  the
       density of features.

       Tippecanoe  will  normally  drop  a  fraction  of  point features at zooms below the maxzoom, to keep the
       low-zoom tiles from getting too big. If you have a smaller data  set  where  all  the  points  would  fit
       without  dropping  any  of  them, use <b>-r1</b> to keep them all.  If you do want point dropping, but you still
       want the tiles to be denser than <b>-zg</b> thinks they should be, use <b>-B</b> to  set  a  basezoom  lower  than  the
       maxzoom.

       If  some  of your tiles are coming out too big in spite of the settings above, you will often want to use
       <b>--drop-densest-as-needed</b> to drop whatever fraction of the features is necessary at  each  zoom  level  to
       make that zoom level's tiles work.

       If your features have a lot of attributes, use <b>-y</b> to keep only the ones you really need.

       If your input is formatted as newline-delimited GeoJSON, use <b>-P</b> to make input parsing a lot faster.

              • <u>name</u><b>.fgb</b>: Read the named FlatGeobuf input file into a layer called <u>name</u>.

              • <u>name</u><b>.csv</b>: Read the named CSV input file into a layer called <u>name</u>.

              • <b>-l</b>  <u>name</u> or <b>--layer=</b><u>name</u>: Use the specified layer name instead of deriving a name from the input
                filename or output tileset. If there are multiple input  files  specified,  the  files  are  all
                merged into the single named layer, even if they try to specify individual names with <b>-L</b>.

              • <b>-L</b>  <u>name</u><b>:</b><u>file.json</u> or <b>--named-layer=</b><u>name</u><b>:</b><u>file.json</u>: Specify layer names for individual files. If
                your shell supports it, you can use a  subshell  redirect  like  <b>-L</b>  <u>name</u><b>:&lt;(cat</b>  <b>dir/*.json)</b>  to
                specify a layer name for the output of streamed input.

              • <b>-L{</b><u>layer-json</u><b>}</b>  or <b>--named-layer={</b><u>layer-json</u><b>}</b>: Specify an input file and layer options by a JSON
                object. The JSON object must contain a <b>"file"</b> key to specify the filename to read from. (If  the
                <b>"file"</b>  key  is  an  empty string, it means to read from the standard input stream.) It may also
                contain a <b>"layer"</b> field to specify the name of  the  layer,  and/or  a  <b>"description"</b>  field  to
                specify  the layer's description in the tileset metadata, and/or a <b>"format"</b> field to specify <b>csv</b>
                or <b>fgb</b> file format if it is not obvious from the <b>name</b>. Example:

              tippecanoe -z5 -o world.mbtiles -L'{"file":"ne_10m_admin_0_countries.json", "layer":"countries", "description":"Natural Earth countries"}'

       CSV input files currently support only Point geometries, from columns  named  <b>latitude</b>,  <b>longitude</b>,  <b>lat</b>,
       <b>lon</b>, <b>long</b>, <b>lng</b>, <b>x</b>, or <b>y</b>.

   <b>Parallel</b> <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> <b>input</b>
              • <b>-P</b>  or  <b>--read-parallel</b>: Use multiple threads to read different parts of each GeoJSON input file
                at once.  This will only work if the input is line-delimited JSON with each Feature on  its  own
                line,  because  it  knows nothing of the top-level structure around the Features. Spurious "EOF"
                error messages may result otherwise.  Performance will be better if the input is  a  named  file
                that can be mapped into memory rather than a stream that can only be read sequentially.

       If  the  input  file  begins  with  the  RFC 8142 ⟨https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8142⟩ record separator,
       parallel processing of input will be invoked automatically, splitting at record separators rather than at
       all newlines.

       Parallel processing will also be automatic if the input file is in FlatGeobuf format.

   <b>Projection</b> <b>of</b> <b>input</b>
              • <b>-s</b> <u>projection</u> or <b>--projection=</b><u>projection</u>: Specify the projection of the  input  data.  Currently
                supported are <b>EPSG:4326</b> (WGS84, the default) and <b>EPSG:3857</b> (Web Mercator). In general you should
                use WGS84 for your input files if at all possible.

   <b>Zoom</b> <b>levels</b>
              • <b>-z</b>  <u>zoom</u>  or  <b>--maximum-zoom=</b><u>zoom</u>: Maxzoom: the highest zoom level for which tiles are generated
                (default 14)

              • <b>-zg</b> or <b>--maximum-zoom=g</b>: Guess what is probably a reasonable maxzoom based  on  the  spacing  of
                features.

              • <b>--smallest-maximum-zoom-guess=</b><u>zoom</u>:  Guess  what  is  probably a reasonable maxzoom based on the
                spacing of features, but using the specified <u>zoom</u> if a lower maxzoom is guessed. If <b>-Bg</b> is  also
                set,  the base zoom will be set to the guessed maxzoom, with all the points carried forward into
                additional zooms through the one specified.

              • <b>-Z</b> <u>zoom</u> or <b>--minimum-zoom=</b><u>zoom</u>: Minzoom: the lowest zoom level for  which  tiles  are  generated
                (default 0)

              • <b>-ae</b>  or  <b>--extend-zooms-if-still-dropping</b>:  Increase  the  maxzoom  if  features are still being
                dropped at that zoom level.  The detail and simplification options that ordinarily apply only to
                the maximum zoom level will apply both to the originally  specified  maximum  zoom  and  to  any
                levels added beyond that.

              • <b>--extend-zooms-if-still-dropping-maximum=</b><u>count</u>: Increase the maxzoom if features are still being
                dropped at that zoom level by up to <u>count</u> zoom levels.

              • <b>-R</b>  <u>zoom</u><b>/</b><u>x</u><b>/</b><u>y</u>  or  <b>--one-tile=</b><u>zoom</u><b>/</b><u>x</u><b>/</b><u>y</u>:  Set the minzoom and maxzoom to <u>zoom</u> and produce only the
                single specified tile at that zoom level.

       If you know the precision to which you want  your  data  to  be  represented,  or  the  map  scale  of  a
       corresponding  printed map, this table shows the approximate precision and scale corresponding to various
       <b>-z</b> options if you use the default <b>-d</b> detail of 12:

   <b>Tile</b> <b>resolution</b>
              • <b>-d</b> <u>detail</u> or <b>--full-detail=</b><u>detail</u>: Detail at max zoom level (default 12, for tile resolution  of
                2

              • <b>-D</b>  <u>detail</u>  or <b>--low-detail=</b><u>detail</u>: Detail at lower zoom levels (default 12, for tile resolution
                of 2

              • <b>-m</b> <u>detail</u> or <b>--minimum-detail=</b><u>detail</u>: Minimum detail that it will try if tiles are  too  big  at
                regular detail (default 7)

              • <b>--extra-detail=</b><u>detail</u>:  Generate  tiles  with even more detail than the "full" detail at the max
                zoom level, to maximize location precision.  These  tiles  may  not  work  with  some  rendering
                software  that internally limits detail to 12 or 13. The extra detail does not affect the choice
                of maxzoom  guessing,  the  amount  of  simplification,  or  the  "tiny  polygon"  threshold  as
                <b>--full-detail</b> does. The tiles should look the same as they did without it, except that they will
                be more precise when overzoomed.

       All  internal  math is done in terms of a 32-bit tile coordinate system, so 1/(2 of the size of Earth, or
       about 1cm, is the smallest distinguishable distance. If <u>maxzoom</u> + <u>detail</u> &gt; 32, no  additional  resolution
       is  obtained  than  by  using a smaller <u>maxzoom</u> or <u>detail</u>, and the <u>detail</u> of tiles will be reduced to the
       maximum that can be used with the specified <u>maxzoom</u>.

   <b>Filtering</b> <b>feature</b> <b>attributes</b>
              • <b>-x</b> <u>name</u> or <b>--exclude=</b><u>name</u>: Exclude the named attributes  from  all  features.  You  can  specify
                multiple  <b>-x</b>  options to exclude several attributes. (Don't comma-separate names within a single
                <b>-x</b>.)

              • <b>-y</b> <u>name</u> or <b>--include=</b><u>name</u>: Include the named attributes in all features, excluding all those not
                explicitly named. You can specify multiple <b>-y</b> options to explicitly include several  attributes.
                (Don't comma-separate names within a single <b>-y</b>.)

              • <b>-X</b> or <b>--exclude-all</b>: Exclude all attributes and encode only geometries

   <b>Modifying</b> <b>feature</b> <b>attributes</b>
              • <b>-T</b><u>attribute</u><b>:</b><u>type</u> or <b>--attribute-type=</b><u>attribute</u><b>:</b><u>type</u>: Coerce the named feature <u>attribute</u> to be of
                the  specified  <u>type</u>.   The  <u>type</u> may be <b>string</b>, <b>float</b>, <b>int</b>, or <b>bool</b>.  If the type is <b>bool</b>, then
                original attributes of <b>0</b> (or, if numeric, <b>0.0</b>, etc.), <b>false</b>, <b>null</b>, or the  empty  string  become
                <b>false</b>,  and  otherwise  become <b>true</b>.  If the type is <b>float</b> or <b>int</b> and the original attribute was
                non-numeric, it becomes <b>0</b>.  If the type is <b>int</b> and the original attribute was floating-point, it
                is rounded to the nearest integer.

              • <b>-Y</b><u>attribute</u><b>:</b><u>description</u> or <b>--attribute-description=</b><u>attribute</u><b>:</b><u>description</u>:  Set  the  <b>description</b>
                for  the specified attribute in the tileset metadata to <u>description</u> instead of the usual <b>String</b>,
                <b>Number</b>, or <b>Boolean</b>.

              • <b>-E</b><u>attribute</u><b>:</b><u>operation</u>  or   <b>--accumulate-attribute=</b><u>attribute</u><b>:</b><u>operation</u>:   Preserve   the   named
                <u>attribute</u>  from  features that are dropped, coalesced-as-needed, or clustered. The <u>operation</u> may
                be <b>sum</b>, <b>product</b>, <b>mean</b>, <b>max</b>, <b>min</b>, <b>concat</b>,  or  <b>comma</b>  to  specify  how  the  named  <u>attribute</u>  is
                accumulated  onto the attribute of the same name in a feature that does survive.  The attributes
                and operations may also be specified as JSON keys and  values:  <b>--accumulate-attribute='{"attr":</b>
                <b>"operation",</b> <b>"attr2",</b> <b>"operation2"}'</b>.

              • <b>--set-attribute</b> <u>attribute</u><b>:</b><u>value</u>: Set the value of the specified <u>attribute</u> in each feature to the
                specified <u>value</u>. This is mostly useful to give an attribute in each feature an initial value for
                <b>--accumulate-attribute</b>.   The  attributes  and  values  may  also  be specified as JSON keys and
                values: <b>--set-attribute='{"attr":</b> <b>value,</b> <b>"attr2",</b> <b>value}'</b>.

              • <b>-pe</b> or <b>--empty-csv-columns-are-null</b>: Treat empty CSV columns  as  nulls  rather  than  as  empty
                strings.

              • <b>-aI</b>  or  <b>--convert-stringified-ids-to-numbers</b>: If a feature ID is the string representation of a
                number, convert it to a plain number to use as the feature ID.

              • <b>--use-attribute-for-id=</b><u>name</u>: Use the attribute with the specified <u>name</u> as if it  were  specified
                as  the feature ID. (If this attribute is a stringified number, you must also use <b>-aI</b> to convert
                it to a number.)

              • <b>-pN</b>  or  <b>--single-precision</b>:  Write  double-precision  numeric  attribute  values  to  tiles  as
                single-precision to reduce tile size.

   <b>Filtering</b> <b>features</b> <b>by</b> <b>attributes</b>
              • <b>-j</b>  <u>filter</u>  or <b>--feature-filter</b>=<u>filter</u>: Check features against a per-layer filter (as defined in
                the  Mapbox  GL  Style  Specification   ⟨https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/#other-
                filter⟩  or  in  a  Felt filter specification still to be finalized) and only include those that
                match. Any features in layers that have no filter specified will be passed through. Filters  for
                the layer <b>"*"</b> apply to all layers. The special variable <b>$zoom</b> refers to the current zoom level.

              • <b>-J</b> <u>filter-file</u> or <b>--feature-filter-file</b>=<u>filter-file</u>: Like <b>-j</b>, but read the filter from a file.

       Example: to find the Natural Earth countries with low <b>scalerank</b> but high <b>LABELRANK</b>:

              tippecanoe -z5 -o filtered.mbtiles -j '{ "ne_10m_admin_0_countries": [ "all", [ "&lt;", "scalerank", 3 ], [ "&gt;", "LABELRANK", 5 ] ] }' ne_10m_admin_0_countries.geojson

       Example: to retain only major TIGER roads at low zoom levels:

              tippecanoe -o roads.mbtiles -j '{ "*": [ "any", [ "&gt;=", "$zoom", 11 ], [ "in", "MTFCC", "S1100", "S1200" ] ] }' tl_2015_06001_roads.json

       Tippecanoe  also  accepts  expressions  of  the  form <b>[</b> <b>"attribute-filter",</b> <b>name,</b> <b>expression</b> <b>]</b>, to filter
       individual feature attributes instead of entire features. For example, you can exclude the road names  at
       low zoom levels by doing

              tippecanoe -o roads.mbtiles -j '{ "*": [ "attribute-filter", "FULLNAME", [ "&gt;=", "$zoom", 9 ] ] }' tl_2015_06001_roads.json

       An <b>attribute-filter</b> expression itself is always considered to evaluate to <b>true</b> (in other words, to retain
       the  feature instead of dropping it). If you want to use multiple <b>attribute-filter</b> expressions, or to use
       other expressions to remove features from the same layer, enclose them in an <b>all</b> expression so they  will
       all be evaluated.

   <b>Dropping</b> <b>a</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>features</b> <b>by</b> <b>zoom</b> <b>level</b>
              • <b>-r</b>  <u>rate</u>  or  <b>--drop-rate=</b><u>rate</u>:  Rate  at  which  dots are dropped at zoom levels below basezoom
                (default 2.5).  If you use <b>-rg</b>, it will guess a drop rate that will keep at most 50,000 features
                in the densest tile.  You can also specify a marker-width with <b>-rg</b><u>width</u> to allow fewer  features
                in  the  densest  tile to compensate for the larger marker, or <b>-rf</b><u>number</u> to allow at most <u>number</u>
                features in the densest tile.  If you use <b>-rp</b> with <b>-zg</b> or <b>--smallest-maximum-zoom-guess</b> it  will
                choose  a  drop  rate  from the same distance-between-features metrics as are used to choose the
                maxzoom.

              • <b>-B</b> <u>zoom</u> or <b>--base-zoom=</b><u>zoom</u>: Base zoom, the level at and above which all points are included  in
                the  tiles (default maxzoom).  If you use <b>-Bg</b>, it will guess a zoom level that will keep at most
                50,000 features in the densest tile.  You can also specify a marker-width with <b>-Bg</b><u>width</u> to allow
                fewer features in the densest tile to compensate for the larger marker, or <b>-Bf</b><u>number</u> to allow at
                most <u>number</u> features in the densest tile.

              • <b>--retain-points-multiplier=</b><u>multiple</u>: Retain the specified multiple of points instead of just the
                number of points that would ordinarily be retained by the drop rate. These can  be  thinned  out
                later  with  the  <b>-m</b>  option  to <b>tippecanoe-overzoom</b>. The start of each cluster is marked in the
                feature   sequence   by    the    <b>tippecanoe:retain_points_multiplier_first</b>    attribute.    The
                <b>--tile-size-limit</b> will also be extended at low zoom levels to allow for the multiplied features.

              • <b>--drop-denser=</b><u>percentage</u>:  When  dropping  dots  at  zoom  levels  below the base zoom, give the
                specified <u>percentage</u> preference to retaining points in sparse areas and dropping points in dense
                areas.

              • <b>--limit-base-zoom-to-maximum-zoom</b> or <b>-Pb</b>: Limit the guessed base zoom not to exceed the maxzoom,
                even if this would put more than the requested number of features in a base zoom tile.

              • <b>-al</b> or <b>--drop-lines</b>: Let "dot" dropping at lower zooms apply to lines too

              • <b>-ap</b> or <b>--drop-polygons</b>: Let "dot" dropping at lower zooms apply to polygons too

              • <b>-K</b> <u>distance</u> or <b>--cluster-distance=</b><u>distance</u>: Cluster points (as with <b>--cluster-densest-as-needed</b>,
                but without the experimental discovery process) that are approximately within <u>distance</u>  of  each
                other. The units are tile coordinates within a nominally 256-pixel tile, so the maximum value of
                255  allows  only  one  feature  per tile. Values around 10 are probably appropriate for typical
                marker sizes. See <b>--cluster-densest-as-needed</b> below for behavior.

              • <b>-k</b> <u>zoom</u> or <b>--cluster-maxzoom=</b><u>zoom</u>: Max zoom on which to cluster points if clustering is enabled.

              • <b>-kg</b> or <b>--cluster-maxzoom=g</b>: Set <b>--cluster-maxzoom=</b> to <b>maxzoom</b> <b>-</b>  <b>1</b>  so  that  all  features  are
                visible at the maximum zoom level.

              • <b>--preserve-point-density-threshold=</b><u>level</u>:  At  the  low zoom levels, do not reduce point density
                below the specified <u>level</u>, even if the specfied drop rate would normally call for  it,  so  that
                low-density  areas  of  the  map do not appear blank. The unit is the distance between preserved
                points, as a fraction of the size of a tile. Values of 32 or 64  are  probably  appropriate  for
                typical marker sizes.

   <b>Dropping</b> <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>features</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>under</b> <b>tile</b> <b>size</b> <b>limits</b>
              • <b>-as</b>  or  <b>--drop-densest-as-needed</b>:  If  a  tile  is too large, try to reduce it to under 500K by
                increasing the minimum spacing between features. The discovered spacing applies  to  the  entire
                zoom level.

              • <b>-ad</b>  or  <b>--drop-fraction-as-needed</b>:  Dynamically  drop  some fraction of features from each zoom
                level to keep large tiles under the 500K size limit. (This is like <b>-pd</b> but applies to the entire
                zoom level, not to each tile.)

              • <b>-an</b> or <b>--drop-smallest-as-needed</b>: Dynamically drop the smallest features  (physically  smallest:
                the  shortest lines or the smallest polygons) from each zoom level to keep large tiles under the
                500K size limit.

              • <b>-aN</b> or <b>--coalesce-smallest-as-needed</b>: Dynamically  combine  the  smallest  features  (physically
                smallest:  the  shortest  lines  or  the smallest polygons or the densest points) from each zoom
                level into other nearby features to keep large tiles under the 500K size limit. This option will
                probably not help very much with LineStrings. It is mostly intended for  polygons,  to  maintain
                the  full  original area covered by polygons while still reducing the feature count somehow. The
                attributes of the small polygons are <u>not</u> preserved into the combined  features  (except  through
                <b>--accumulate-attribute</b>), only their geometry. Furthermore, the polygons to which nested polygons
                are coalesced may not necessarily be the immediately enclosing features.

              • <b>-aD</b>  or  <b>--coalesce-densest-as-needed</b>:  Dynamically  combine the densest features from each zoom
                level into other nearby features to keep large tiles under the 500K size limit.  (Again,  mostly
                useful for polygons.)

              • <b>-aS</b>  or <b>--coalesce-fraction-as-needed</b>: Dynamically combine a fraction of features from each zoom
                level into other nearby features to keep large tiles under the 500K size limit.  (Again,  mostly
                useful for polygons.)

              • <b>-pd</b>  or  <b>--force-feature-limit</b>:  Dynamically  drop some fraction of features from large tiles to
                keep them under the 500K size limit. It will probably look ugly at the tile boundaries. (This is
                like <b>-ad</b> but applies to each tile individually, not to the  entire  zoom  level.)  You  probably
                don't want to use this.

              • <b>-aC</b> or <b>--cluster-densest-as-needed</b>: If a tile is too large, try to reduce its size by increasing
                the  minimum spacing between features, and leaving one placeholder feature from each group.  The
                remaining feature will be given a <b>"clustered":</b> <b>true</b> attribute to indicate that it  represents  a
                cluster,  a  <b>"point_count"</b> attribute to indicate the number of features that were clustered into
                it, and a <b>"sqrt_point_count"</b> attribute to indicate the relative width of a feature to  represent
                the  cluster.  If  the  features  being clustered are points, the representative feature will be
                located at the average of the  original  points'  locations;  otherwise,  one  of  the  original
                features will be left as the representative.

   <b>Dropping</b> <b>tightly</b> <b>overlapping</b> <b>features</b>
              • <b>-g</b>  <u>gamma</u> or <b>--gamma=_gamma</b>_: Rate at which especially dense dots are dropped (default 0, for no
                effect). A gamma of 2 reduces the number of dots less than a pixel apart to the square  root  of
                their original number.

              • <b>-aG</b>  or  <b>--increase-gamma-as-needed</b>:  If  a tile is too large, try to reduce it to under 500K by
                increasing the <b>-g</b> gamma. The discovered gamma applies to the entire  zoom  level.  You  probably
                want to use <b>--drop-densest-as-needed</b> instead.

   <b>Line</b> <b>and</b> <b>polygon</b> <b>simplification</b>
              • <b>-S</b>  <u>scale</u>  or <b>--simplification=</b><u>scale</u>: Multiply the tolerance for line and polygon simplification
                by <u>scale</u>. The standard tolerance tries to keep the line or polygon within one tile unit  of  its
                proper location. You can probably go up to about 10 without too much visible difference.

              • <b>-ps</b> or <b>--no-line-simplification</b>: Don't simplify lines and polygons

              • <b>-pS</b>  or <b>--simplify-only-low-zooms</b>: Don't simplify lines and polygons at maxzoom (but do simplify
                at lower zooms)

              • <b>--simplification-at-maximum-zoom=</b><u>scale</u>: Use the  specified  <u>scale</u>  at  maxzoom  instead  of  the
                standard simplification scale (which still applies at lower zooms)

              • <b>-pn</b>  or  <b>--no-simplification-of-shared-nodes</b>:  Don't simplify away nodes at which LineStrings or
                Polygon rings converge, diverge, or  cross.  (This  will  not  be  effective  if  you  also  use
                <b>--coalesce</b>.)  In  between  intersection  nodes,  LineString  segments  or  polygon edges will be
                simplified identically in each feature if possible. Use this instead of <b>--detect-shared-borders</b>.

              • <b>-pt</b> or <b>--no-tiny-polygon-reduction</b>: Don't combine the area of very  small  polygons  into  small
                squares that represent their combined area.

              • <b>-pT</b> or <b>--no-tiny-polygon-reduction-at-maximum-zoom</b>: Combine the area of very small polygons into
                small squares that represent their combined area only at zoom levels below the maximum.

              • <b>--tiny-polygon-size=</b><u>size</u>:  Use  the  specified  <u>size</u> for tiny polygons instead of the default 2.
                Anything above 6 or so will lead to visible artifacts with the default tile detail.

              • <b>-av</b> or <b>--visvalingam</b>: Use Visvalingam's simplification algorithm rather than Douglas-Peucker's.

   <b>Attempts</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>shared</b> <b>polygon</b> <b>boundaries</b>
              • <b>-ab</b>    or    <b>--detect-shared-borders</b>:    DEPRECATED.    In    the     manner     of     TopoJSON
                ⟨https://github.com/mbostock/topojson/wiki/Introduction⟩, detect borders that are shared between
                multiple polygons and simplify them identically in each polygon. This takes more time and memory
                than considering each polygon individually. Use <b>no-simplification-of-shared-nodes</b> instead, which
                is faster and more correct.

              • <b>-aL</b>  or  <b>--grid-low-zooms</b>:  At  all  zoom levels below <u>maxzoom</u>, snap all lines and polygons to a
                stairstep grid instead of allowing diagonals. You will also want to specify a  tile  resolution,
                probably  <b>-D8</b>.  This option provides a way to display continuous parcel, gridded, or binned data
                at low zooms without overwhelming the tiles with tiny polygons, since features will  either  get
                stretched out to the grid unit or lost entirely, depending on how they happened to be aligned in
                the original data. You probably don't want to use this.

   <b>Controlling</b> <b>clipping</b> <b>to</b> <b>tile</b> <b>boundaries</b>
              • <b>-b</b>  <u>pixels</u>  or  <b>--buffer=</b><u>pixels</u>:  Buffer size where features are duplicated from adjacent tiles.
                Units are "screen pixels"—1/256th of the tile width or height. (default 5)

              • <b>-pc</b> or <b>--no-clipping</b>: Don't clip features to the size of the tile. If  a  feature  overlaps  the
                tile's  bounds  or  buffer  at all, it is included completely. Be careful: this can produce very
                large tilesets, especially with large polygons.

              • <b>-pD</b> or <b>--no-duplication</b>: As with <b>--no-clipping</b>, each feature is included intact instead  of  cut
                to tile boundaries. In addition, it is included only in a single tile per zoom level rather than
                potentially  in multiple copies. Clients of the tileset must check adjacent tiles (possibly some
                distance away) to ensure they have all features.

   <b>Reordering</b> <b>features</b> <b>within</b> <b>each</b> <b>tile</b>
              • <b>-pi</b> or <b>--preserve-input-order</b>: Preserve the original input order  of  features  as  the  drawing
                order  instead of ordering geographically. (This is implemented as a restoration of the original
                order at the end, so that dot-dropping is still geographic, which means it also undoes <b>-ao</b>).

              • <b>-ac</b> or <b>--coalesce</b>: Coalesce consecutive features that have the  same  attributes.  This  can  be
                useful  if you have lots of small polygons with identical attributes and you would like to merge
                them together.

              • <b>-ao</b> or <b>--reorder</b>: Reorder features to put ones with the same attributes in sequence (instead  of
                ones  that  are  approximately spatially adjacent), to try to get them to coalesce. You probably
                want to use this if you use <b>--coalesce</b>.

              • <b>-ar</b> or <b>--reverse</b>: Try reversing the directions of lines  to  make  them  coalesce  and  compress
                better. You probably don't want to use this.

              • <b>-ah</b>  or  <b>--hilbert</b>:  Put  features  in  Hilbert  Curve  order instead of the usual Z-Order. This
                improves the odds that spatially adjacent features will be  sequentially  adjacent,  and  should
                improve density calculations and spatial coalescing. It should be the default eventually.

              • <b>--order-by=</b><u>attribute</u>:  Order  features  by the specified <u>attribute</u>, in alphabetical or numerical
                order. Multiple <b>--order-by</b> and <b>--order-descending-by</b> options may be specified, the  first  being
                the primary sort key.

              • <b>--order-descending-by=</b><u>attribute</u>:   Order   features  by  the  specified  <u>attribute</u>,  in  reverse
                alphabetical or numerical order. Multiple <b>--order-by</b> and <b>--order-descending-by</b>  options  may  be
                specified, the first being the primary sort key.

              • <b>--order-smallest-first</b>:  Order  features  so  the  smallest  geometry  comes first in each tile.
                Multiple <b>--order-by</b> and <b>--order-descending-by</b> options may be  specified,  the  first  being  the
                primary sort key.

              • <b>--order-largest-first</b>: Order features so the largest geometry comes first in each tile. Multiple
                <b>--order-by</b>  and <b>--order-descending-by</b> options may be specified, the first being the primary sort
                key.

   <b>Adding</b> <b>calculated</b> <b>attributes</b>
              • <b>-ag</b> or <b>--calculate-feature-density</b>: Add a new  attribute,  <b>tippecanoe_feature_density</b>,  to  each
                feature,  to  record  how densely features are spaced in that area of the tile. You can use this
                attribute in the style to produce a glowing effect where points are densely packed. It can range
                from 0 in the sparsest areas to 255 in the densest.

              • <b>-ai</b> or <b>--generate-ids</b>: Add an <b>id</b> (a feature ID, not an attribute named <b>id</b>) to each feature  that
                does  not  already  have  one.  There is currently no guarantee that the <b>id</b> added will be stable
                between runs or that it will not conflict with manually-assigned feature IDs. Future versions of
                Tippecanoe may change the mechanism for allocating IDs.

   <b>Trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>correct</b> <b>bad</b> <b>source</b> <b>geometry</b>
              • <b>-aw</b> or <b>--detect-longitude-wraparound</b>: Detect when consecutive points within a  feature  jump  to
                the other side of the world, and try to fix the geometry.

              • <b>-pw</b>  or  <b>--use-source-polygon-winding</b>: Instead of respecting GeoJSON polygon ring order, use the
                original polygon winding  in  the  source  data  to  distinguish  inner  (clockwise)  and  outer
                (counterclockwise) polygon rings.

              • <b>-pW</b>  or  <b>--reverse-source-polygon-winding</b>: Instead of respecting GeoJSON polygon ring order, use
                the opposite  of  the  original  polygon  winding  in  the  source  data  to  distinguish  inner
                (counterclockwise) and outer (clockwise) polygon rings.

              • <b>--clip-bounding-box=</b><u>minlon</u><b>,</b><u>minlat</u><b>,</b><u>maxlon</u><b>,</b><u>maxlat</u>:  Clip  all  features  to the specified bounding
                box.

              • <b>-aP</b> or <b>--convert-polygons-to-label-points</b>: Replace polygon geometries  with  a  label  point  or
                points for the polygon in each tile it intersects.

   <b>Setting</b> <b>or</b> <b>disabling</b> <b>tile</b> <b>size</b> <b>limits</b>
              • <b>-M</b>  <u>bytes</u>  or  <b>--maximum-tile-bytes=</b><u>bytes</u>:  Use  the  specified  number  of <u>bytes</u> as the maximum
                compressed tile size instead of 500K.

              • <b>-O</b> <u>features</u> or <b>--maximum-tile-features=</b><u>features</u>: Use the specified number  of  <u>features</u>  as  the
                maximum in a tile instead of 200,000.

              • <b>--limit-tile-feature-count=</b><u>features</u>:  Abruptly  limit  each  tile  to  the  specified  number of
                <u>features</u>, after ordering them if specified.

              • <b>--limit-tile-feature-count-at-maximum-zoom=</b><u>features</u>: Abruptly limit each  tile  at  the  maximum
                zoom level to the specified number of <u>features</u>, after ordering them if specified.

              • <b>-pf</b> or <b>--no-feature-limit</b>: Don't limit tiles to 200,000 features

              • <b>-pk</b> or <b>--no-tile-size-limit</b>: Don't limit tiles to 500K bytes

              • <b>-pC</b>  or  <b>--no-tile-compression</b>:  Don't  compress  the  PBF  vector tile data. If you are getting
                "Unimplemented type 3" error messages from  a  renderer,  it  is  probably  because  it  expects
                uncompressed tiles using this option rather than the normal gzip-compressed tiles.

              • <b>-pg</b>  or  <b>--no-tile-stats</b>:  Don't  generate  the  <b>tilestats</b>  row in the tileset metadata. Uploads
                without tilestats ⟨https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-geostats⟩ will take longer to process.

              • <b>--tile-stats-attributes-limit=</b><u>count</u>:  Include  <b>tilestats</b>  information  about   at   most   <u>count</u>
                attributes instead of the default 1000.

              • <b>--tile-stats-sample-values-limit=</b><u>count</u>:  Calculate <b>tilestats</b> attribute statistics based on <u>count</u>
                values instead of the default 1000.

              • <b>--tile-stats-values-limit=</b><u>count</u>: Report <u>count</u> unique attribute values in  <b>tilestats</b>  instead  of
                the default 100.

   <b>Temporary</b> <b>storage</b>
              • <b>-t</b>  <u>directory</u>  or <b>--temporary-directory=</b><u>directory</u>: Put the temporary files in <u>directory</u>.  If you
                don't specify, it will use <b><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></b>.

   <b>Progress</b> <b>indicator</b>
              • <b>-q</b> or <b>--quiet</b>: Work quietly instead of reporting progress or warning messages

              • <b>-Q</b> or <b>--no-progress-indicator</b>: Don't report progress, but still give warnings

              • <b>-U</b> <u>seconds</u> or <b>--progress-interval=</b><u>seconds</u>: Don't report progress more often than  the  specified
                number of <u>seconds</u>.

              • <b>-u</b>  or  <b>--json-progress</b>: like <b>-quiet</b> but logs progress as a JSON object. Use in combination with
                <b>-U</b>.

              • <b>-v</b> or <b>--version</b>: Report Tippecanoe's version number

   <b>Filters</b>
              • <b>-C</b> <u>command</u> or <b>--prefilter=</b><u>command</u>: Specify a shell filter command to be  run  at  the  start  of
                assembling each tile

              • <b>-c</b>  <u>command</u>  or  <b>--postfilter=</b><u>command</u>:  Specify  a  shell filter command to be run at the end of
                assembling each tile

       The pre- and post-filter commands allow you to do optional filtering or transformation on the features of
       each tile as it is created. They are shell commands, run with the zoom level, X, and Y as the <b>$1</b>, <b>$2</b>, and
       <b>$3</b> arguments.  Future versions of Tippecanoe may add additional arguments for more context.

       The features are provided to the filter as a series of newline-delimited GeoJSON objects on the  standard
       input, and <b>tippecanoe</b> expects to read another set of GeoJSON features from the filter's standard output.

       The  prefilter  receives  the  features  at the highest available resolution, before line simplification,
       polygon topology repair, gamma calculation, dynamic feature dropping, or other internal processing.   The
       postfilter receives the features at tile resolution, after simplification, cleaning, and dropping.

       The layer name is provided as part of the <b>tippecanoe</b> element of the feature and must be passed through to
       keep  the  feature  in  its  correct layer. In the case of the prefilter, the <b>tippecanoe</b> element may also
       contain <b>index</b>, <b>sequence</b>, <b>extent</b>, and <b>dropped</b>,  elements,  which  must  be  passed  through  for  internal
       operations like <b>--drop-densest-as-needed</b>, <b>--drop-smallest-as-needed</b>, and <b>--preserve-input-order</b> to work.

   <b>Examples:</b>
              • Make  a  tileset  of  the  Natural  Earth  countries  to zoom level 5, and also copy the GeoJSON
                features to files in a <b>tiles/z/x/y.geojson</b> directory hierarchy.

</pre><h4><b>Environment</b></h4><pre>
       Tippecanoe ordinarily uses as many parallel  threads  as  the  operating  system  claims  that  CPUs  are
       available.  You can override this number by setting the <b>TIPPECANOE_MAX_THREADS</b> environmental variable.

</pre><h4><b>GeoJSON</b> <b>extension</b></h4><pre>
       Tippecanoe  defines a GeoJSON extension that you can use to specify the minimum and/or maximum zoom level
       at which an individual feature will be included in the vector tileset being  produced.   If  you  have  a
       feature like this:

              {
                  "type" : "Feature",
                  "tippecanoe" : { "maxzoom" : 9, "minzoom" : 4 },
                  "properties" : { "FULLNAME" : "N Vasco Rd" },
                  "geometry" : {
                      "type" : "LineString",
                      "coordinates" : [ [ -121.733350, 37.767671 ], [ -121.733600, 37.767483 ], [ -121.733131, 37.766952 ] ]
                  }
              }

       with  a  <b>tippecanoe</b> object specifiying a <b>maxzoom</b> of 9 and a <b>minzoom</b> of 4, the feature will only appear in
       the vector tiles for zoom levels 4 through 9. Note that the <b>tippecanoe</b> object belongs to the Feature, not
       to its <b>properties</b>. If you specify a <b>minzoom</b> for a feature, it will be preserved down to that  zoom  level
       even if dot-dropping with <b>-r</b> would otherwise have dropped it.

       You  can also specify a layer name in the <b>tippecanoe</b> object, which will take precedence over the filename
       or name specified using <b>--layer</b>, like this:

              {
                  "type" : "Feature",
                  "tippecanoe" : { "layer" : "streets" },
                  "properties" : { "FULLNAME" : "N Vasco Rd" },
                  "geometry" : {
                      "type" : "LineString",
                      "coordinates" : [ [ -121.733350, 37.767671 ], [ -121.733600, 37.767483 ], [ -121.733131, 37.766952 ] ]
                  }
              }

       If your source GeoJSON only has <b>minzoom</b>, <b>maxzoom</b> and/or <b>layer</b> within <b>properties</b> you  can  use  ndjson-cli
       ⟨https://github.com/mbostock/ndjson-cli/blob/master/README.md⟩  to move them into the required <b>tippecanoe</b>
       object by piping the GeoJSON like this:

              ndjson-map 'd.tippecanoe = { minzoom: d.properties.minzoom, maxzoom: d.properties.maxzoom, layer: d.properties.layer }, delete d.properties.minzoom, delete d.properties.maxzoom, delete d.properties.layer, d'

</pre><h4><b>Geometric</b> <b>simplifications</b></h4><pre>
       At every zoom level, line and polygon features are subjected to  Douglas-Peucker  simplification  to  the
       resolution of the tile.

       For  point  features,  it drops 1/2.5 of the dots for each zoom level above the point base zoom (which is
       normally the same as the <b>-z</b> max zoom, but can be a different zoom specified with <b>-B</b> if you  have  precise
       but  sparse  data).   I don't know why 2.5 is the appropriate number, but the densities of many different
       data sets fall off at about this same rate. You can use -r to specify a different rate.

       You can use the gamma option to thin out especially dense clusters of points.  For any  area  where  dots
       are closer than one pixel together (at whatever zoom level), a gamma of 3, for example, will reduce these
       clusters to the cube root of their original density.

       For  line features, it drops any features that are too small to draw at all.  This still leaves the lower
       zooms too dark (and too dense for the 500K tile limit, in some places),  so  I  need  to  figure  out  an
       equitable way to throw features away.

       Unless  you  specify  <b>--no-tiny-polygon-reduction</b>,  any  polygons  that  are  smaller than a minimum area
       (currently 4 square subpixels) will have their probability diffused, so that some of them will  be  drawn
       as  a square of this minimum size and others will not be drawn at all, preserving the total area that all
       of them should have had together.

       Features in the same tile that share the same type and attributes are coalesced together  into  a  single
       geometry  if  you  use  <b>--coalesce</b>.  You  are  strongly  encouraged  to use <b>-x</b> to exclude any unnecessary
       attributes to reduce wasted file size.

       If a tile is larger than 500K, it will try encoding that tile at progressively lower  resolutions  before
       failing if it still doesn't fit.

</pre><h4><b>Development</b></h4><pre>
       Requires sqlite3 and zlib (should already be installed on MacOS). Rebuilding the manpage uses md2man (<b>gem</b>
       <b>install</b> <b>md2man</b>).

       Linux:

              sudo apt-get install build-essential libsqlite3-dev zlib1g-dev

       Then build:

              make

       and perhaps

              make install

       Tippecanoe  now  requires  features  from the 2011 C++ standard. If your compiler is older than that, you
       will need to install a newer one. On MacOS, updating to the lastest XCode should get  you  a  new  enough
       version of <b>clang++</b>. On Linux, you should be able to upgrade <b>g++</b> with

              sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
              sudo apt-get update -y
              sudo apt-get install -y g++-5
              export CXX=g++-5

</pre><h4><b>Docker</b> <b>Image</b></h4><pre>
       A  tippecanoe  Docker  image  can  be  built  from source and executed as a task to automatically install
       dependencies and allow tippecanoe to run on any system supported by Docker.

              $ docker build -t tippecanoe:latest .
              $ docker run -it --rm \
                -v /tiledata:/data \
                tippecanoe:latest \
                tippecanoe --output=/data/output.mbtiles /data/example.geojson

       The commands above will build a Docker image from the source and compile the latest  version.  The  image
       supports all tippecanoe flags and options.

</pre><h4><b>Examples</b></h4><pre>
       Check out some examples of maps made with tippecanoe ⟨MADE_WITH.md⟩

</pre><h4><b>Name</b></h4><pre>
       The  name  is a joking reference ⟨<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tippecanoe_and_Tyler_Too">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tippecanoe_and_Tyler_Too</a>⟩ to a "tiler" for
       making map tiles.

</pre><h4><b>tile-join</b></h4><pre>
       Tile-join is a tool for copying and merging vector mbtiles files and for joining new  attributes  from  a
       CSV file to existing features in them.

       It  reads  the tiles from an existing .mbtiles file, .pmtiles file, or a directory of tiles, matches them
       against the records of the CSV (if one is specified), and writes out a new tileset.

       If you specify multiple source mbtiles files or source directories of tiles, all the sources are read and
       their combined contents are written to the new mbtiles output. If they define the same layers or the same
       tiles, the layers or tiles are merged.

       The options are:

   <b>Output</b> <b>tileset</b>
              • <b>-o</b> <u>out.mbtiles</u>, <u>out.pmtiles</u> or <b>--output=</b><u>out.mbtiles</u>:  Write  the  new  tiles  to  the  specified
                .mbtiles file.

              • <b>-e</b>  <u>directory</u> or <b>--output-to-directory=</b><u>directory</u>: Write the new tiles to the specified directory
                instead of to an mbtiles file.

              • <b>-f</b> or <b>--force</b>: Remove <u>out.mbtiles</u> if it already exists.

              • <b>-r</b> or <b>--read-from</b>: list of input mbtiles to read from.

   <b>Overzooming</b>
              • <b>--overzoom</b>: If one of the source tilesets has a larger maxzoom than the others, scale  up  tiles
                from  the  tilesets with the lower maxzooms so they will all have the same maxzoom in the output
                tileset.

              • <b>--buffer=</b><u>pixels</u> or <b>-b</b> <u>pixels</u>: Set the size of the tile buffer in the overzoomed tiles.

   <b>Tileset</b> <b>description</b> <b>and</b> <b>attribution</b>
              • <b>-A</b> <u>attribution</u> or <b>--attribution=</b><u>attribution</u>: Set the attribution string.

              • <b>-n</b> <u>name</u> or <b>--name=</b><u>name</u>: Set the tileset name.

              • <b>-N</b> <u>description</u> or <b>--description=</b><u>description</u>: Set the tileset description.

   <b>Layer</b> <b>filtering</b> <b>and</b> <b>naming</b>
              • <b>-l</b> <u>layer</u> or <b>--layer=</b><u>layer</u>: Include the named layer in the output. You can  specify  multiple  <b>-l</b>
                options to keep multiple layers. If you don't specify, they will all be retained.

              • <b>-L</b>  <u>layer</u>  or  <b>--exclude-layer=</b><u>layer</u>:  Remove  the  named layer from the output. You can specify
                multiple <b>-L</b> options to remove multiple layers.

              • <b>-R</b><u>old</u><b>:</b><u>new</u> or <b>--rename-layer=</b><u>old</u><b>:</b><u>new</u>: Rename the layer named <u>old</u> to be named <u>new</u> instead. You can
                specify multiple <b>-R</b> options to rename multiple layers. Renaming happens before filtering.

   <b>Zoom</b> <b>levels</b>
              • <b>-z</b> <u>zoom</u> or <b>--maximum-zoom=</b><u>zoom</u>: Don't copy tiles from higher zoom levels than the specified zoom

              • <b>-Z</b> <u>zoom</u> or <b>--minimum-zoom=</b><u>zoom</u>: Don't copy tiles from lower zoom levels than the specified zoom

   <b>Merging</b> <b>attributes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>CSV</b> <b>file</b>
              • <b>-c</b> <u>match</u><b>.csv</b> or <b>--csv=</b><u>match</u><b>.csv</b>: Use <u>match</u><b>.csv</b> as the source for new attributes to join  to  the
                features.  The  first  line of the file should be the key names; the other lines are values. The
                first column is the one to match against the existing features; the other columns  are  the  new
                data to add.

   <b>Filtering</b> <b>features</b> <b>and</b> <b>feature</b> <b>attributes</b>
              • <b>-x</b> <u>key</u> or <b>--exclude=</b><u>key</u>: Remove attributes named <u>key</u> from the output. You can use this to remove
                the  field  you  are  matching  against if you no longer need it after joining, or to remove any
                other attributes you don't want. You can use multiple <b>-x</b> options to remove multiple attributes.

              • <b>-X</b> or <b>--exclude-all</b>: Remove all attributes from the output.

              • <b>-y</b> <u>key</u> or <b>--include=</b><u>key</u>: Remove all attributes except for those named <u>key</u> from the  output.  You
                can use multiple <b>-y</b> options to retain multiple attributes.

              • <b>-i</b> or <b>--if-matched</b>: Only include features that matched the CSV.

              • <b>-j</b>  <u>filter</u>  or <b>--feature-filter</b>=<u>filter</u>: Check features against a per-layer filter (as defined in
                the  Mapbox  GL  Style  Specification   ⟨https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/#other-
                filter⟩) and only include those that match. Any features in layers that have no filter specified
                will be passed through. Filters for the layer <b>"*"</b> apply to all layers.

              • <b>-J</b> <u>filter-file</u> or <b>--feature-filter-file</b>=<u>filter-file</u>: Like <b>-j</b>, but read the filter from a file.

              • <b>-pe</b>  or  <b>--empty-csv-columns-are-null</b>:  Treat  empty  CSV  columns as nulls rather than as empty
                strings.

   <b>Setting</b> <b>or</b> <b>disabling</b> <b>tile</b> <b>size</b> <b>limits</b>
              • <b>-pk</b> or <b>--no-tile-size-limit</b>: Don't skip tiles larger than 500K.

              • <b>-pC</b> or <b>--no-tile-compression</b>: Don't compress the PBF vector tile data.

              • <b>-pg</b> or <b>--no-tile-stats</b>: Don't generate the  <b>tilestats</b>  row  in  the  tileset  metadata.  Uploads
                without tilestats ⟨https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-geostats⟩ will take longer to process.

              • <b>--tile-stats-attributes-limit=</b><u>count</u>:   Include   <b>tilestats</b>   information  about  at  most  <u>count</u>
                attributes instead of the default 1000.

              • <b>--tile-stats-sample-values-limit=</b><u>count</u>: Calculate <b>tilestats</b> attribute statistics based on  <u>count</u>
                values instead of the default 1000.

              • <b>--tile-stats-values-limit=</b><u>count</u>:  Report  <u>count</u>  unique attribute values in <b>tilestats</b> instead of
                the default 100.

       Because tile-join just copies the geometries to the new  .mbtiles  without  processing  them  (except  to
       rescale  the  extents  if  necessary), it doesn't have any of tippecanoe's recourses if the new tiles are
       bigger than the 500K tile limit.  If a tile is too big and you haven't specified <b>-pk</b>, it is just left out
       of the new tileset.

</pre><h4><b>Example</b></h4><pre>
       Imagine you have a tileset of census blocks:

              curl -L -O <a href="http://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2010/TABBLOCK/2010/tl_2010_06001_tabblock10.zip">http://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2010/TABBLOCK/2010/tl_2010_06001_tabblock10.zip</a>
              unzip tl_2010_06001_tabblock10.zip
              ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON tl_2010_06001_tabblock10.json tl_2010_06001_tabblock10.shp
              ./tippecanoe -o tl_2010_06001_tabblock10.mbtiles tl_2010_06001_tabblock10.json

       and a CSV of their populations:

              curl -L -O <a href="http://www2.census.gov/census_2010/01-Redistricting_File--PL_94-171/California/ca2010.pl.zip">http://www2.census.gov/census_2010/01-Redistricting_File--PL_94-171/California/ca2010.pl.zip</a>
              unzip -p ca2010.pl.zip cageo2010.pl |
              awk 'BEGIN {
                  print "GEOID10,population"
              }
              (substr($0, 9, 3) == "750") {
                  print "\"" substr($0, 28, 2) substr($0, 30, 3) substr($0, 55, 6) substr($0, 62, 4) "\"," (0 + substr($0, 328, 9))
              }' &gt; population.csv

       which looks like this:

              GEOID10,population
              "060014277003018",0
              "060014283014046",0
              "060014284001020",0
              ...
              "060014507501001",202
              "060014507501002",119
              "060014507501003",193
              "060014507501004",85
              ...

       Then you can join those populations to the geometries and discard the no-longer-needed ID field:

              ./tile-join -o population.mbtiles -x GEOID10 -c population.csv tl_2010_06001_tabblock10.mbtiles

</pre><h4><b>tippecanoe-enumerate</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>tippecanoe-enumerate</b> utility lists the tiles that an <b>mbtiles</b> file defines.  Each line of  the  output
       lists  the  name  of  the  <b>mbtiles</b>  file  and the zoom, x, and y coordinates of one of the tiles. It does
       basically the same thing as

              select zoom_level, tile_column, (1 &lt;&lt; zoom_level) - 1 - tile_row from tiles;

       on the file in sqlite3.

</pre><h4><b>tippecanoe-decode</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>tippecanoe-decode</b> utility turns vector mbtiles back to GeoJSON. You can use it either  on  an  entire
       file:

              tippecanoe-decode file.mbtiles
              tippecanoe-decode file.pmtiles

       or on an individual tile:

              tippecanoe-decode file.mbtiles zoom x y
              tippecanoe-decode file.vector.pbf zoom x y

       Unless  you  use  <b>-c</b>,  the  output  is a set of nested FeatureCollections identifying each tile and layer
       separately. Note that the same features generally appear at all zooms, so the output for  the  file  will
       have many copies of the same features at different resolutions.

   <b>Options</b>
              • <b>-s</b>  <u>projection</u>  or <b>--projection=</b><u>projection</u>: Specify the projection of the output data. Currently
                supported are EPSG:4326 (WGS84, the default) and EPSG:3857 (Web Mercator).

              • <b>-z</b> <u>maxzoom</u> or <b>--maximum-zoom=</b><u>maxzoom</u>: Specify the highest zoom level to decode from the tileset

              • <b>-Z</b> <u>minzoom</u> or <b>--minimum-zoom=</b><u>minzoom</u>: Specify the lowest zoom level to decode from the tileset

              • <b>-l</b> <u>layer</u> or <b>--layer=</b><u>layer</u>: Decode only layers with the specified names. (Multiple <b>-l</b> options can
                be specified.)

              • <b>-c</b> or <b>--tag-layer-and-zoom</b>: Include  each  feature's  layer  and  zoom  level  as  part  of  its
                <b>tippecanoe</b> object rather than as a FeatureCollection wrapper

              • <b>-S</b>  or  <b>--stats</b>: Just report statistics about each tile's size and the number of features in it,
                as a JSON structure.

              • <b>-f</b> or <b>--force</b>: Decode tiles even if polygon ring order or closure problems are detected

              • <b>-I</b> or <b>--integer</b>: Report coordinates in integer tile coordinates

              • <b>-F</b> or <b>--fraction</b>: Report coordinates as a fraction of the tile extent

</pre><h4><b>tippecanoe-json-tool</b></h4><pre>
       Extracts GeoJSON features or standalone geometries as line-delimited JSON  objects  from  a  larger  JSON
       file, following the same extraction rules that Tippecanoe uses when parsing JSON.

              tippecanoe-json-tool file.json [... file.json]

       Optionally also wraps them in a FeatureCollection or GeometryCollection as appropriate.

       Optionally extracts an attribute from the GeoJSON <b>properties</b> for sorting.

       Optionally joins a sorted CSV of new attributes to a sorted GeoJSON file.

       The  reason  for  requiring  sorting  is so that it is possible to work on CSV and GeoJSON files that are
       larger than can comfortably fit in memory by streaming through them in parallel, in the same way that the
       Unix <b>join</b> command does. The Unix <b>sort</b> command can be used  to  sort  large  files  to  prepare  them  for
       joining.

       The sorting interface is weird, and future version of <b>tippecanoe-json-tool</b> will replace it with something
       better.

   <b>Options</b>
              • <b>-w</b> or <b>--wrap</b>: Add the FeatureCollection or GeometryCollection wrapper.

              • <b>-e</b>  <u>attribute</u>  or  <b>--extract=</b><u>attribute</u>: Extract the named attribute as a prefix to each feature.
                The formatting makes excessive use of <b>\u</b> quoting so that it follows JSON string rules  but  will
                still be sorted correctly by tools that just do ASCII comparisons.

              • <b>-c</b>  <u>file.csv</u>  or <b>--csv=</b><u>file.csv</u>: Join attributes from the named sorted CSV file, using its first
                column as the join key. Geometries will be passed through even if they do not match the CSV; CSV
                lines that do not match a geometry will be discarded.

              • <b>-pe</b> or <b>--empty-csv-columns-are-null</b>: Treat empty CSV columns  as  nulls  rather  than  as  empty
                strings.

   <b>Example</b>
       Join  Census  LEHD  (Longitudinal  Employer-Household Dynamics ⟨https://lehd.ces.census.gov/⟩) employment
       data to a file of Census block geography for Tippecanoe County, Indiana.

       Download Census block geometry, and convert to GeoJSON:

              $ curl -L -O https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2010/TABBLOCK/2010/tl_2010_18157_tabblock10.zip
              $ unzip tl_2010_18157_tabblock10.zip
              $ ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON tl_2010_18157_tabblock10.json tl_2010_18157_tabblock10.shp

       Download Indiana employment data, and fix name of join key in header

              $ curl -L -O https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/lodes/LODES7/in/wac/in_wac_S000_JT00_2015.csv.gz
              $ gzip -dc in_wac_S000_JT00_2015.csv.gz | sed '1s/w_geocode/GEOID10/' &gt; in_wac_S000_JT00_2015.csv

       Sort GeoJSON block geometry so it is ordered by block ID. If you don't do this, you will get  a  "GeoJSON
       file is out of sort" error.

              $ tippecanoe-json-tool -e GEOID10 tl_2010_18157_tabblock10.json | LC_ALL=C sort &gt; tl_2010_18157_tabblock10.sort.json

       Join block geometries to employment attributes:

              $ tippecanoe-json-tool -c in_wac_S000_JT00_2015.csv tl_2010_18157_tabblock10.sort.json &gt; blocks-wac.json

</pre><h4><b>tippecanoe-overzoom</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>tippecanoe-overzoom</b> utility creates a vector tile from one of its parent tiles, clipping and scaling
       the geometry from the parent tile and excluding features that are clipped away. The idea is that  if  you
       create  very  high  resolution  tiles  (using  <b>--extra-detail</b>)  at  a  moderate  zoom  level, you can use
       <b>tippecanoe-overzoom</b> to turn those into moderate detail tiles at high zoom  levels,  for  the  benefit  of
       renderers  that  cannot  internally  overzoom high-resolution tiles without losing some of the precision.
       Running:

              tippecanoe-overzoom -o out.mvt.gz inz/inx/iny outz/outx/outy in.mvt.gz

       reads tile <b>inz/inx/iny</b> of <b>in.mvt.gz</b> and produces tile <b>outz/outx/outy</b> of <b>out.mvt.gz</b>.

   <b>Options</b>
              • <b>-b</b> <u>buffer</u>: Set the tile buffer in the output tile (default 5)

              • <b>-d</b> <u>detail</u>: Set the detail of the output tile (default 12)

              • <b>-y</b> <u>attribute</u>: Retain the specified <u>attribute</u> in the output features. All attributes that are not
                named in a <b>-y</b> option will be removed.

              • <b>-j</b> <u>filter</u>: Filter features using the same expression syntax as in tippecanoe.

              • <b>-m</b>: If a tile was created with the <b>--retain-points-multiplier</b> option, thin the tile back down to
                its normal feature count during overzooming.  The  first  feature  from  each  cluster  will  be
                retained,  unless  <b>-j</b>  is used to specify a filter, in which case the first matching filter from
                each cluster will be retained instead.

              • <b>--preserve-input-order</b>: Restore a set of filtered features to its original input order

              • <b>--accumulate-attribute</b>: Behaves as in <b>tippecanoe</b> to  sum  attributes  from  the  features  of  a
                multiplier  cluster that are not included in the final output. The attributes from features that
                are filtered away with <b>-j</b> are <u>not</u> accumulated onto the output feature.

                                                                                                    <u>tippecanoe</u>()
