</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dtn2adminep - administrative endpoint task for the "dtn" scheme

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dtn2adminep</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dtn2adminep</b> is a background "daemon" task that receives and processes administrative bundles (all custody
       signals and, nominally, all bundle status reports) that are sent to the "dtn"-scheme administrative
       endpoint on the local ION node, if and only if such an endpoint was established by <b>bpadmin</b>.  It is
       spawned automatically by <b>bpadmin</b> in response to the 's' (START) command that starts operation of Bundle
       Protocol on the local ION node, and it is terminated by <b>bpadmin</b> in response to an 'x' (STOP) command.
       <b>dtn2adminep</b> can also be spawned and terminated in response to START and STOP commands that pertain
       specifically to the "dtn" scheme.

       <b>dtn2adminep</b> responds to custody signals as specified in the Bundle Protocol specification, RFC 5050.  It
       responds to bundle status reports by logging ASCII text messages describing the reported activity.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       "0" <b>dtn2adminep</b>  terminated,  for  reasons  noted  in  the  <b>ion.log</b>  file.   If  this termination was not
           commanded, investigate and solve the problem identified in the log file and use  <b>bpadmin</b>  to  restart
           <b>dtn2adminep</b>.

       "1" <b>dtn2adminep</b> was unable to attach to Bundle Protocol operations or was unable to load the "dtn" scheme
           database, probably because <b>bpadmin</b> has not yet been run.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       No configuration files are needed.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       No environment variables apply.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       The following diagnostics may be issued to the <b>ion.log</b> log file:

       dtn2adminep can't attach to BP.
           <b>bpadmin</b> has not yet initialized BP operations.

       dtn2adminep can't load routing database.
           <b>dtn2admin</b> has not yet initialized the "dtn" scheme.

       dtn2adminep can't get admin EID.
           <b>dtn2admin</b> has not yet initialized the "dtn" scheme.

       dtn2adminep crashed.
           An unrecoverable database error was encountered.  <b>dtn2adminep</b> terminates.
