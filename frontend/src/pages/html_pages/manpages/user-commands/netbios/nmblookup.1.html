</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This tool is part of the <b><a href="../man7/samba.7.html">samba</a></b>(7) suite.

       nmblookup is used to query NetBIOS names and map them to IP addresses in a network using NetBIOS over
       TCP/IP queries. The options allow the name queries to be directed at a particular IP broadcast area or to
       a particular machine. All queries are done over UDP.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -M|--master-browser
           Searches for a master browser by looking up the NetBIOS <u>name</u> with a type of <b>0x1d</b>. If
            <u>name</u> is "-" then it does a lookup on the special name <b>__MSBROWSE__</b>. Please note that in order to use
           the name "-", you need to make sure "-" isn't parsed as an argument, e.g. use : <b>nmblookup</b> <b>-M</b> <b>--</b> <b>-</b>.

       --recursion
           Set the recursion desired bit in the packet to do a recursive lookup. This is used when sending a
           name query to a machine running a WINS server and the user wishes to query the names in the WINS
           server. If this bit is unset the normal (broadcast responding) NetBIOS processing code on a machine
           is used instead. See RFC1001, RFC1002 for details.

       -S|--status
           Once the name query has returned an IP address then do a node status query as well. A node status
           query returns the NetBIOS names registered by a host.

       -r|--root-port
           Try and bind to UDP port 137 to send and receive UDP datagrams. The reason for this option is a bug
           in Windows 95 where it ignores the source port of the requesting packet and only replies to UDP port
           137. Unfortunately, on most UNIX systems root privilege is needed to bind to this port, and in
           addition, if the <b><a href="../man8/nmbd.8.html">nmbd</a></b>(8) daemon is running on this machine it also binds to this port.

       -A|--lookup-by-ip
           Interpret <u>name</u> as an IP Address and do a node status query on this address.

       -B|--broadcast &lt;broadcast address&gt;
           Send the query to the given broadcast address. Without this option the default behavior of nmblookup
           is to send the query to the broadcast address of the network interfaces as either auto-detected or
           defined in the <u>interfaces</u> parameter of the <b><a href="../man5/smb.conf.5.html">smb.conf</a></b>(5) file.

       -U|--unicast &lt;unicast address&gt;
           Do a unicast query to the specified address or host <u>unicast</u> <u>address</u>. This option (along with the <u>-R</u>
           option) is needed to query a WINS server.

       -T|--translate
           This causes any IP addresses found in the lookup to be looked up via a reverse DNS lookup into a DNS
           name, and printed out before each

           <u>IP</u> <u>address</u> <u>....</u> <u>NetBIOS</u> <u>name</u>

           pair that is the normal output.

       -f|--flags
           Show which flags apply to the name that has been looked up. Possible answers are zero or more of:
           Response, Authoritative, Truncated, Recursion_Desired, Recursion_Available, Broadcast.

       name
           This is the NetBIOS name being queried. Depending upon the previous options this may be a NetBIOS
           name or IP address. If a NetBIOS name then the different name types may be specified by appending
           '#&lt;type&gt;' to the name. This name may also be '*', which will return all registered names within a
           broadcast area.

       -d|--debuglevel=DEBUGLEVEL
           <u>level</u> is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this parameter is not specified is 1 for
           client applications.

           The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files about the activities of the
           server. At level 0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a reasonable
           level for day-to-day running - it generates a small amount of information about operations carried
           out.

           Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and should only be used when
           investigating a problem. Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE
           amounts of log data, most of which is extremely cryptic.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the <b>log</b> <b>level</b> parameter in the
           /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

       --debug-stdout
           This will redirect debug output to STDOUT. By default all clients are logging to STDERR.

       --configfile=&lt;configuration file&gt;
           The file specified contains the configuration details required by the client. The information in this
           file can be general for client and server or only provide client specific like options such as <b>client</b>
           <b>smb</b> <b>encrypt</b>. See /etc/samba/smb.conf for more information. The default configuration file name is
           determined at compile time.

       --option=&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;
           Set the <b><a href="../man5/smb.conf.5.html">smb.conf</a></b>(5) option "&lt;name&gt;" to value "&lt;value&gt;" from the command line. This overrides
           compiled-in defaults and options read from the configuration file. If a name or a value includes a
           space, wrap whole --option=name=value into quotes.

       -l|--log-basename=logdirectory
           Base directory name for log/debug files. The extension <b>".progname"</b> will be appended (e.g.
           log.smbclient, log.smbd, etc...). The log file is never removed by the client.

       --leak-report
           Enable talloc leak reporting on exit.

       --leak-report-full
           Enable full talloc leak reporting on exit.

       -V|--version
           Prints the program version number.

       -R|--name-resolve=NAME-RESOLVE-ORDER
           This option is used to determine what naming services and in what order to resolve host names to IP
           addresses. The option takes a space-separated string of different name resolution options. The best
           is to wrap the whole --name-resolve=NAME-RESOLVE-ORDER into quotes.

           The options are: "lmhosts", "host", "wins" and "bcast". They cause names to be resolved as follows:

                  •   <b>lmhosts</b>: Lookup an IP address in the Samba lmhosts file. If the line in lmhosts has no
                      name type attached to the NetBIOS name (see the <b><a href="../man5/lmhosts.5.html">lmhosts</a></b>(5) for details) then any name type
                      matches for lookup.

                  •   <b>host</b>: Do a standard host name to IP address resolution, using the system <a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a>, NIS,
                      or DNS lookups. This method of name resolution is operating system dependent, for instance
                      on IRIX or Solaris this may be controlled by the <a href="file:/etc/nsswitch.conf">/etc/nsswitch.conf</a> file). Note that this
                      method is only used if the NetBIOS name type being queried is the 0x20 (server) name type,
                      otherwise it is ignored.

                  •   <b>wins</b>: Query a name with the IP address listed in the <u>wins</u> <u>server</u> parameter. If no WINS
                      server has been specified this method will be ignored.

                  •   <b>bcast</b>: Do a broadcast on each of the known local interfaces listed in the <u>interfaces</u>
                      parameter. This is the least reliable of the name resolution methods as it depends on the
                      target host being on a locally connected subnet.

           If this parameter is not set then the name resolve order defined in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file
           parameter (<b>name</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>order</b>) will be used.

           The default order is lmhosts, host, wins, bcast. Without this parameter or any entry in the <b>name</b>
           <b>resolve</b> <b>order</b> parameter of the /etc/samba/smb.conf file, the name resolution methods will be
           attempted in this order.

       -O|--socket-options=SOCKETOPTIONS
           TCP socket options to set on the client socket. See the socket options parameter in the
           /etc/samba/smb.conf manual page for the list of valid options.

       -m|--max-protocol=MAXPROTOCOL
           The value of the parameter (a string) is the highest protocol level that will be supported by the
           client.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the <b>client</b> <b>max</b> <b>protocol</b> parameter in the
           /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

       -n|--netbiosname=NETBIOSNAME
           This option allows you to override the NetBIOS name that Samba uses for itself. This is identical to
           setting the <b>netbios</b> <b>name</b> parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file. However, a command line setting
           will take precedence over settings in /etc/samba/smb.conf.

       --netbios-scope=SCOPE
           This specifies a NetBIOS scope that nmblookup will use to communicate with when generating NetBIOS
           names. For details on the use of NetBIOS scopes, see rfc1001.txt and rfc1002.txt. NetBIOS scopes are
           <u>very</u> rarely used, only set this parameter if you are the system administrator in charge of all the
           NetBIOS systems you communicate with.

       -W|--workgroup=WORKGROUP
           Set the SMB domain of the username. This overrides the default domain which is the domain defined in
           smb.conf. If the domain specified is the same as the servers NetBIOS name, it causes the client to
           log on using the servers local SAM (as opposed to the Domain SAM).

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the <b>workgroup</b> parameter in the
           /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

       -r|--realm=REALM
           Set the realm for the domain.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the <b>realm</b> parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf
           file.

       -?|--help
           Print a summary of command line options.

       --usage
           Display brief usage message.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       nmblookup can be used to query a WINS server (in the same way nslookup is used to query DNS servers). To
       query a WINS server, nmblookup must be called like this:

       nmblookup -U server -R 'name'

       For example, running :

       nmblookup -U samba.org -R 'IRIX#1B'

       would query the WINS server samba.org for the domain master browser (1B name type) for the IRIX
       workgroup.
