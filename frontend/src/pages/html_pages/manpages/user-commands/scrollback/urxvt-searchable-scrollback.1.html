       searchable-scrollback - incremental scrollback search

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Adds regex search functionality to the scrollback buffer, triggered by the "searchable-scrollback:start"
       action (bound to "M-s" by default). While in search mode, normal terminal input/output is suspended and a
       regex is displayed at the bottom of the screen.

       Inputting characters appends them to the regex and continues incremental search. In addition, the
       following bindings are recognized:

       "BackSpace"
           Remove a character from the regex.

       "Insert"
           Append the value of the PRIMARY selection to the regex.

       "Up"
           Search for a match upwards.

       "Down"
           Search for a match downwards.

       "Prior"
           Scroll up.

       "Next"
           Scroll down.

       "End"
           Scroll to the bottom.

       "Escape"
           Leave the mode and return to the point where search was started.

       "Enter" or "Return"
           Leave  the  mode  maintaining  the  current position in the scrollback.  Additionally, if the "Shift"
           modifier is active, store the first match in the current line into the primary selection.

       The regex defaults to "(?i)", resulting in a case-insensitive search. To get a case-sensitive search  you
       can  delete  this  prefix using "BackSpace" or simply use an uppercase character which removes the "(?i)"
       prefix.

       See perlre for more info about perl regular expression syntax.
