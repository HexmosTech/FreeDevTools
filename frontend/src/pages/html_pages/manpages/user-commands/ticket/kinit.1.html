       kinit - obtain and cache Kerberos ticket-granting ticket

       [<b>-R</b>]  [<b>-k</b>  [<b>-i</b>  |  -<b>t</b>  <u>keytab_file</u>]]  [<b>-c</b>  <u>cache_name</u>]  [<b>-n</b>]  [<b>-S</b>  <u>service_name</u>]  [<b>-I</b>  <u>input_ccache</u>]  [<b>-T</b>
       <u>armor_ccache</u>] [<b>-X</b> <u>attribute</u>[=<u>value</u>]] [<b>--request-pac</b> | <b>--no-request-pac</b>] [<u>principal</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       kinit obtains and caches an initial ticket-granting ticket for <u>principal</u>.  If <u>principal</u> is absent,  kinit
       chooses  an  appropriate principal name based on existing credential cache contents or the local username
       of the user invoking kinit.  Some options modify the choice of principal name.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-V</b>     display verbose output.

       <b>-l</b> <u>lifetime</u>
              (duration string.)  Requests a ticket with the lifetime <u>lifetime</u>.

              For example, <b>kinit</b> <b>-l</b> <b>5:30</b> or <b>kinit</b> <b>-l</b> <b>5h30m</b>.

              If the <b>-l</b> option is not specified, the default ticket lifetime (configured by each site) is  used.
              Specifying  a  ticket  lifetime  longer than the maximum ticket lifetime (configured by each site)
              will not override the configured maximum ticket lifetime.

       <b>-s</b> <u>start_time</u>
              (duration string.)  Requests a postdated ticket.  Postdated tickets are issued  with  the  <b>invalid</b>
              flag set, and need to be resubmitted to the KDC for validation before use.

              <u>start_time</u> specifies the duration of the delay before the ticket can become valid.

       <b>-r</b> <u>renewable_life</u>
              (duration string.)  Requests renewable tickets, with a total lifetime of <u>renewable_life</u>.

       <b>-f</b>     requests forwardable tickets.

       <b>-F</b>     requests non-forwardable tickets.

       <b>-p</b>     requests proxiable tickets.

       <b>-P</b>     requests non-proxiable tickets.

       <b>-a</b>     requests tickets restricted to the host's local address[es].

       <b>-A</b>     requests tickets not restricted by address.

       <b>-C</b>     requests  canonicalization  of  the  principal  name, and allows the KDC to reply with a different
              client principal from the one requested.

       <b>-E</b>     treats the principal name as an enterprise name.

       <b>-v</b>     requests that the ticket-granting ticket in the cache (with the <b>invalid</b> flag set) be passed to the
              KDC for validation.  If the ticket is within its requested time range, the cache is replaced  with
              the validated ticket.

       <b>-R</b>     requests  renewal  of  the ticket-granting ticket.  Note that an expired ticket cannot be renewed,
              even if the ticket is still within its renewable life.

              Note that renewable tickets that have expired as reported by <a href="../man1/klist.1.html">klist</a>(1)  may  sometimes  be  renewed
              using  this  option,  because the KDC applies a grace period to account for client-KDC clock skew.
              See <a href="../man5/krb5.conf.5.html">krb5.conf</a>(5) <b>clockskew</b> setting.

       <b>-k</b> [<b>-i</b> | <b>-t</b> <u>keytab_file</u>]
              requests a ticket, obtained from a key in the local host's keytab.  The location of the keytab may
              be specified with the <b>-t</b> <u>keytab_file</u> option, or with the <b>-i</b> option  to  specify  the  use  of  the
              default  client  keytab; otherwise the default keytab will be used.  By default, a host ticket for
              the local host is requested, but any principal may be specified.  On a  KDC,  the  special  keytab
              location  <b>KDB:</b> can be used to indicate that kinit should open the KDC database and look up the key
              directly.  This permits an  administrator  to  obtain  tickets  as  any  principal  that  supports
              authentication based on the key.

       <b>-n</b>     Requests anonymous processing.  Two types of anonymous principals are supported.

              For  fully  anonymous  Kerberos,  configure  pkinit on the KDC and configure <b>pkinit_anchors</b> in the
              client's <a href="../man5/krb5.conf.5.html">krb5.conf</a>(5).  Then use the <b>-n</b> option with a principal  of  the  form  <b>@REALM</b>  (an  empty
              principal  name  followed by the at-sign and a realm name).  If permitted by the KDC, an anonymous
              ticket will be returned.

              A second form of anonymous tickets is supported; these realm-exposed tickets hide the identity  of
              the  client but not the client's realm.  For this mode, use <b>kinit</b> <b>-n</b> with a normal principal name.
              If supported by the KDC, the  principal  (but  not  realm)  will  be  replaced  by  the  anonymous
              principal.

              As of release 1.8, the MIT Kerberos KDC only supports fully anonymous operation.

       <b>-I</b> <u>input_ccache</u>
          Specifies the name of a credentials cache that already contains a ticket.  When obtaining that ticket,
          if  information about how that ticket was obtained was also stored to the cache, that information will
          be used to affect how new credentials  are  obtained,  including  preselecting  the  same  methods  of
          authenticating to the KDC.

       <b>-T</b> <u>armor_ccache</u>
              Specifies  the  name  of  a credentials cache that already contains a ticket.  If supported by the
              KDC, this cache will be used to armor the  request,  preventing  offline  dictionary  attacks  and
              allowing  the  use  of additional preauthentication mechanisms.  Armoring also makes sure that the
              response from the KDC is not modified in transit.

       <b>-c</b> <u>cache_name</u>
              use <u>cache_name</u> as the Kerberos 5 credentials (ticket) cache location.  If this option is not used,
              the default cache location is used.

              The default cache location may vary between systems.  If the <b>KRB5CCNAME</b>  environment  variable  is
              set, its value is used to locate the default cache.  If a principal name is specified and the type
              of  the  default  cache supports a collection (such as the DIR type), an existing cache containing
              credentials for the principal is selected or a new one is created  and  becomes  the  new  primary
              cache.  Otherwise, any existing contents of the default cache are destroyed by kinit.

       <b>-S</b> <u>service_name</u>
              specify an alternate service name to use when getting initial tickets.

       <b>-X</b> <u>attribute</u>[=<u>value</u>]
              specify  a pre-authentication <u>attribute</u> and <u>value</u> to be interpreted by pre-authentication modules.
              The acceptable attribute and value values  vary  from  module  to  module.   This  option  may  be
              specified  multiple times to specify multiple attributes.  If no value is specified, it is assumed
              to be "yes".

              The following attributes are recognized by the PKINIT pre-authentication mechanism:

              <b>X509_user_identity</b>=<u>value</u>
                     specify where to find user's X509 identity information

              <b>X509_anchors</b>=<u>value</u>
                     specify where to find trusted X509 anchor information

              <b>flag_RSA_PROTOCOL</b>[<b>=yes</b>]
                     specify use of RSA, rather than the default Diffie-Hellman protocol

              <b>disable_freshness</b>[<b>=yes</b>]
                     disable sending freshness tokens (for testing purposes only)

       <b>--request-pac</b> | <b>--no-request-pac</b>
              mutually exclusive.  If <b>--request-pac</b> is set, ask the  KDC  to  include  a  PAC  in  authdata;  if
              <b>--no-request-pac</b>  is  set,  ask  the  KDC  not to include a PAC; if neither are set,  the KDC will
              follow its default, which is typically is to include a PAC if doing so is supported.
