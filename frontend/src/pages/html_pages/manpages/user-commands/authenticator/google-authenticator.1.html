</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       google-authenticator - initialize one-time passcodes for the current user

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       google-authenticator [<u>options</u>]

       If no option is provided on the command line, <a href="../man1/google-authenticator.1.html">google-authenticator</a>(1) will ask interactively the user for
       the more important options.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <a href="../man1/google-authenticator.1.html">google-authenticator</a>(1)  command  creates a new secret key in the current user's home directory.  By
       default, this secret key and all settings will be stored in <a href="file:~/.google_authenticator.">~/.google_authenticator.</a>

       If the system supports the libqrencode library, a QRCode will be shown, that can be scanned using the An‐
       droid Google Authenticator application.  If the system does not  have  this  library,  google-authentica‐
       <a href="../man1/tor.1.html">tor</a>(1)  outputs  an URL that can be followed using a web browser.  Alternatively, the alphanumeric secret
       key is also outputted and thus can be manually entered into the Android Google Authenticator application.

       In either case, after the key has been added, the verification value should be checked.  To do that,  the
       user  must  click-and-hold the added entry on its Android system until the context menu shows.  Then, the
       user checks that the displayed key's verification value matches the one  provided  by  google-authentica‐
       <a href="../man1/tor.1.html">tor</a>(1).  Please note that this feature might not be available in all builds of the Android application.

       Each  time  the  user  logs  into  the  system,  he  will  now  be prompted for the TOTP code (time based
       one-time-password) or HOTP (counter-based one-time-password), depending on options  given  to  google-au‐
       <a href="../man1/thenticator.1.html">thenticator</a>(1), after having entered its normal user id and its normal UNIX account password.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The main option consists of choosing the authentication token type: either time based or counter-based.

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--counter-based</b>
              Set up counter-based verification.

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--time-based</b>
              Set up time-based verification.

       From this choice depends the available options.

   <b>Counter-based</b> <b>specific</b> <b>options</b>
       Those settings are only relevant for counter-based one-time-password (HOTP):

       <b>-w,</b> <b>--window-size=</b><u>W</u>
              Set window of concurrently valid codes.

              By  default, three tokens are valid at any one time.  This accounts for generated-but-not-used to‐
              kens and failed login attempts.  In order to decrease the likelihood of synchronization  problems,
              this window can be increased from its default size of 3.

              The window size must be between 1 and 21.

       <b>-W,</b> <b>--minimal-window</b>
              Disable window of concurrently valid codes.

   <b>Time-based</b> <b>specific</b> <b>options</b>
       Those settings are only relevant for time-based one-time-password (TOTP):

       <b>-D,</b> <b>--allow-reuse,</b> <b>-d,</b> <b>--disallow-reuse</b>
              (Dis)allow multiple uses of the same authentication token.

              This  restricts  the user to one login about every 30 seconds, but it increases the chances to no‐
              tice or even prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

       <b>-w,</b> <b>--window-size=</b><u>W</u>
              Set window of concurrently valid codes.

              By default, a new token is generated every 30 seconds by the mobile application.  In order to com‐
              pensate for possible time-skew between the client and the server, an extra token before and  after
              the  current time is allowed.  This allows for a time skew of up to 30 seconds between authentica‐
              tion server and client.

              For example, if problems with poor time synchronization are experienced, the  window  can  be  in‐
              creased  from its default size of 3 permitted codes (one previous code, the current code, the next
              code) to 17 permitted codes (the 8 previous codes, the current code, and the 8 next codes).   This
              will permit for a time skew of up to 4 minutes between client and server.

              The window size must be between 1 and 21.

       <b>-W,</b> <b>--minimal-window</b>
              Disable window of concurrently valid codes.

       <b>-S,</b> <b>--step-size=</b><u>S</u>
              Set interval between token refreshes to <u>S</u> seconds.

              By default, time-based tokens are generated every 30 seconds.  A non-standard value can be config‐
              ured in case a different time-step value must be used.

              The time interval must be between 1 and 60 seconds.

   <b>General</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-s,</b> <b>--secret=</b><u>FILE</u>
              Specify a non-standard file location for the secret key and settings.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--force</b>
              Write secret key and settings without first confirming with user.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--label=</b><u>LABEL</u>
              Override the default label in otpauth:// URL.

       <b>-i,</b> <b>--issuer=</b><u>ISSUER</u>
              Override the default issuer in otpauth:// URL.

       <b>-Q,</b> <b>--qr-mode=</b><u>none|ansi|utf8</u>
              QRCode output mode.

              Suppress  the  QRCode  output (<u>none</u>), or output QRCode using either ANSI colors (<u>ansi</u>), or Unicode
              block elements (<u>utf8</u>).

              Unicode block elements makes the QRCode much smaller, which is often easier to scan.  Unfortunate‐
              ly, many terminal emulators do not display these Unicode characters properly.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--rate-limit=</b><u>N</u><b>,</b> <b>-R,</b> <b>--rate-time=</b><u>M</u><b>,</b> <b>-u,</b> <b>--no-rate-limit</b>
              Disable rate-limiting, or limit logins to N per every M seconds.

              If the system isn't hardened against brute-force login attempts, rate-limiting can be enabled  for
              the authentication module: no more than <u>N</u> login attempts every <u>M</u> seconds.

              The  rate  limit must be between 1 and 10 attempts.  The rate time must be between 15 and 600 sec‐
              onds.

       <b>-e,</b> <b>--emergency-codes=</b><u>N</u>
              Generate <u>N</u> emergency codes.

              A maximum of 10 emergency codes can be generated.

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b>
              Quiet mode.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Print the help message.
