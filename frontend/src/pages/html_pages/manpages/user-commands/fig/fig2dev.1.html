</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fig2dev - translates Fig code to various graphics languages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>fig2dev</b> [<b>-L</b> <u>language</u>] [<b>-m</b> <u>mag</u>] [<b>-s</b> <u>fsize</u>] [<b>-Z</b> <u>maxdimension</u>
               |  <u>&lt;width&gt;</u>w  |  <u>&lt;height&gt;</u>h ] [<b>-D</b> <u>+/-rangelist</u> [<b>-K</b>]]
               [<u>other</u> <u>options</u>] [<u>fig-file</u> [<u>out-file</u>]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fig2dev</b> translates fig code in the named <u>fig-file</u> into the specified graphics <u>language</u> and puts  them  in
       <u>out-file.</u>  The graphics language is inferred from the suffix of <u>out-file,</u> or it must be given with the <b>-L</b>
       option.  The default <u>fig-file</u> and <u>out-file</u> are standard input and standard output, respectively.  A minus
       (-) in place of <u>fig-file</u> or <u>out-file</u> also denotes either standard input or standard output.

       Xfig  (Facility  for  Interactive Generation of figures) is a screen-oriented tool which runs under the X
       Window System, and allows the user to draw and manipulate objects interactively.  This version of fig2dev
       is compatible with xfig versions 1.3, 1.4, 2.0, 2.1, 3.0, 3.1 and 3.2.

       Xfig version 3.2.3 and later saves and allows the user to edit  comments  for  each  Fig  object.   These
       comments  are output with several of the output languages, such as PostScript, CGM, EMF, LaTeX, MetaFont,
       PicTeX, (as % comments), tk (as # comments), and pic (as .\" comments).

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> <b>(all</b> <b>drivers)</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-L</b> <b>language</b>
              Set the output graphics language.  Valid languages are <b>box,</b> <b>cgm,</b> <b>dxf,</b> <b>epic,</b> <b>eepic,</b> <b>eepicemu,</b>  <b>emf,</b>
              <b>eps,</b>  <b>gbx</b>  <b>(Gerber</b>  <b>beta</b> <b>driver),</b> <b>gif,</b> <b>ibmgl,</b> <b>jpeg,</b> <b>latex,</b> <b>map</b> <b>(HTML</b> <b>image</b> <b>map),</b> <b>mf</b> <b>(MetaFont),</b> <b>mp</b>
              <b>(MetaPost),</b> <b>pcx,</b> <b>pdf,</b> <b>pdftex,</b> <b>pdftex_t,</b>  <b>pic,</b>  <b>pict2e,</b>  <b>pictex,</b>  <b>png,</b>  <b>ppm,</b>  <b>ps,</b>  <b>pstex,</b>  <b>pstex_t,</b>
              <b>pstricks,</b> <b>ptk</b> <b>(Perl/tk),</b> <b>shape</b> <b>(LaTeX</b> <b>shaped</b> <b>paragraphs),</b> <b>sld</b> <b>(AutoCad</b> <b>slide</b> <b>format),</b> <b>svg,</b> <b>textyl,</b>
              <b>tiff,</b> <b>tikz,</b> <b>tk</b> <b>(tcl/tk),</b> <b>tpic,</b> <b>xbm</b> <b>and</b> <b>xpm</b>.

              Notes:
              You  must  have  ghostscript  installed  to  get  the pdf output, and ghostscript and one from the
              netpbm, the ImageMagick or the GraphicsMagick packages to  get  the  bitmap  formats  (png,  jpeg,
              etc.).

       <b>-h</b>     Print help message with all options for all output languages then exit.

       <b>-V</b>     Print the program version number and exit.

       <b>-D</b> <b>+/-rangelist</b>
              With  <u>+rangelist</u>,  keep  only  those  depths in the list.  With <u>-rangelist</u>, keep all depths except
              those in the list.  The rangelist may be a list of comma-separated numbers or ranges separated  by
              colon (:). For example, <b>-D</b> <b>+10,40,55:70,80</b> means keep only layers 10, 40, 55 through 70, and 80.

       <b>-K</b>     The  selection  of  the  depths  with  the  <b>-D</b>  <u>+/-rangelist</u>  option  does normally not affect the
              calculation of the bounding box.  Thus the generated document might have a  much  larger  bounding
              box than necessary. If <b>-K</b> is given then the bounding box is adjusted to include only those objects
              in the selected depths.

       <b>-E</b> <b>encoding</b>
              Specify  the  character  encoding  of the input file.  Must be one of the strings listed by `iconv
              --list`, e.g., ISO-8859-1 or UTF-8.  Defaults to the encoding of the current locale.   It  may  be
              necessary  to  set  this  option  if  the input file was produced on a different computer, or in a
              different language environment.

       <b>-G</b> <b>minor[:major][:unit]</b>
              Draws a grid on the page.  Specify thin, or thin and thick line spacing in one of  several  units.
              For  example,  <b>-G</b> <b>.25:1cm</b> draws a thin, gray line every .25 cm and a thicker gray line every 1 cm.
              Specifying <b>-G</b> <b>1in</b> draws a thin line every 1 inch.  Fractions may be used, e.g. <b>-G</b> <b>:1/2in</b> will draw
              a thick line every 1/2 inch.
              Allowable units are: i, in, inch, f, ft, feet, c, cm, mm, and m.
              <b>Only</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> <b>PostScript,</b> <b>EPS,</b> <b>PDF,</b> <b>pstricks,</b> <b>tikz</b> <b>and</b> <b>bitmap</b> <b>(GIF,</b> <b>JPEG,</b> <b>etc)</b> <b>drivers.</b>

       <b>-m</b> <b>mag</b> Set the magnification at which the figure is rendered to <u>mag.</u>  The default is 1.0.  This  may  not
              be used with the maxdimension option (<b>-Z</b>).

       <b>-s</b> <b>fsize</b>
              Set  the  default  font  size  (in  points,  1/72 inch) for text objects to <u>fsize.</u>  The default is
              11*mag, and thus is scaled by the <b>-m</b> option.  If there is no scaling, the default font  is  eleven
              point Roman.

       <b>-Z</b> <b>maxdimension|&lt;width&gt;w|&lt;height&gt;h|&lt;width&gt;:|:&lt;height&gt;</b>
              Scale  the  figure  so  that the maximum dimension (width or height) is <u>maxdimension</u> inches or cm,
              depending on whether the figure was saved with imperial or metric units.  Scale the figure to  the
              given  width  by  appending  a  'w'  or  a  colon, scale to the given height by appending a 'h' or
              prepending a colon.  This may not be used with the magnification option (<b>-m</b>).

       <u>other</u> <u>options</u>
              The other options are specific to the choice of graphics <u>language,</u> as described below.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>COMMON</b> <b>TO</b> <b>ALL</b> <b>BITMAP</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-b</b> <b>borderwidth</b>
              Make blank border around figure of width <u>borderwidth</u> (1/72 inch).

       <b>-F</b>     Use correct font sizes (points, 1/72 inch) instead of the traditional size that xfig/fig2dev uses,
              which is 1/80 inch.  The corresponding xfig command-line option is -correct_font_size.

       <b>-g</b> <b>color</b>
              Use <u>color</u> for the background.

       <b>-N</b>     Convert all colors to grayscale.

       <b>-S</b> <b>smoothfactor</b>
              This will smooth the output by passing <u>smoothfactor</u> to  ghostscript  in  the  <u>-dTextAlphaBits</u>  and
              <u>-dGraphicsAlphaBits</u>  options  to  improve  font rendering and graphic smoothing.  A value of 2 for
              <u>smoothfactor</u> provides some smoothing and 4 provides more.

</pre><h4><b>GIF</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-t</b> <b>color</b>
              Use <u>color</u> for the transparent color in the GIF file.  This must be specified in  the  same  format
              that  <a href="../man1/ppmmake.1.html">ppmmake</a>(1)  allows.   It  may  allow an X11 color name, but at least you may use a six-digit
              hexadecimal RGBvalue using the # sign, e.g. #ff0000 (Red).

</pre><h4><b>JPEG</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-q</b> <b>image_quality</b>
              use the integer value <u>image_quality</u> for the JPEG "Quality" factor.  Valid values are 0 - 100, with
              the default being 75.

</pre><h4><b>CGM</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       CGM is Computer Graphics Metafile, developed by ISO and ANSI and is a vector-based plus bitmap  language.
       Microsoft  WORD,  PowerPoint  and  probably  other  products can import this format <u>and</u> <u>display</u> <u>it</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u>
       <u>screen,</u> something that they won't do with EPS files that have an ASCII preview.

       <b>-a</b>     Generate binary output.

       <b>-r</b>     Position arrowheads for CGM viewers that display rounded  arrowheads.   Normally,  arrowheads  are
              pointed, so fig2dev compensates for this by moving the endpoint of the line back so the tip of the
              arrowhead  ends  where  the  original  endpoint  of  the  line was.  If the <b>-r</b> option is used, the
              position of arrows will <u>NOT</u> be corrected for compensating line width effects, because the  rounded
              arrowhead doesn't extend beyond the endpoint of the line.

</pre><h4><b>DXF</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       DXF is the Drawing Interchange File Format.  The output to DXF is experimental.

       <b>-P</b>     Rotate the figure to portrait mode. The default is landscape mode.

</pre><h4><b>EMF</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       EMF  is  Enhanced Metafile, developed by Microsoft and is a vector-based plus bitmap language.  Microsoft
       WORD, PowerPoint and probably other products can import  this  format  <u>and</u>  <u>display</u>  <u>it</u>  <u>on</u>  <u>the</u>  <u>screen,</u>
       something that they won't do with EPS files that have an ASCII preview.

       <b>-l</b> <b>lang</b>
              Set  the  compatibility level to <u>lang</u>, where <u>lang</u> is one of <u>win95,</u> <u>win98</u> or <u>winnt.</u>  The default is
              <u>winnt</u>.

       <b>-r</b>     Position arrowheads for EMF viewers that display rounded arrowheads.  See the discussion of the <b>-r</b>
              option for the CGM output driver above.

</pre><h4><b>EPIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       EPIC is an enhancement to LaTeX picture drawing environment.

       EEPIC is an extension to EPIC and LaTeX picture  drawing  environment  which  uses  tpic  specials  as  a
       graphics  mechanism.   It  was  written  by  Conrad Kwok of Division of Computer Science at University of
       California, Davis.  Conrad Kwok has also written the EEPIC driver of fig2dev.

       EEPIC-EMU is an EEPIC emulation package which does not use tpic specials.

       When including EPIC/EEPIC output in a LaTeX file, use "<b>\usepackage{epic,eepic}</b>" in the preamble.

       <b>-d</b> <b>factor</b>
              Scale arrowheads by <u>factor.</u>  The width and height of arrowheads is <u>divided</u> by this  factor.   This
              is because EPIC arrowheads are normally about double the size of TeX arrowheads.

       <b>-F</b>     Don't  set  the font face, series, and style; only set it's size and the baselineskip. By default,
              fig2dev sets all 5 font parameters when it puts some text. The disadvantage is that you can't  set
              the  font  from  your  LaTeX  document.  With this option on, you can set the font from your LaTeX
              document.

              If any of the pictures included in your LaTeX document  has  been  generated  with  <b>-F</b>,  then  all
              pictures must be generated with this option.

       <b>-f</b> <b>font</b>
              Set  the  default  font  used for text objects to <u>font</u>, where <u>font</u> is one of <u>rm</u>, <u>bf</u>, <u>it</u>, <u>sf</u> or <u>tt</u>.
              The default is <u>rm</u>.

       <b>-l</b> <b>lwidth</b>
              Use "<b>\thicklines</b>" when the width of the line is equal or wider than <u>lwidth.</u>  The default is 2.

       <b>-P</b>     Generate a complete LaTeX file. In other words, the output file can be formatted without requiring
              any changes.

       <b>-R</b> <b>dummyarg</b>
              Allow rotated text. Rotated text will be set using the \rotatebox command.  So, you will  need  to
              include  "<b>\usepackage{graphics}</b>"  in  the  preamble  of  your LaTeX document.  A dummy argument is
              required after the <b>-R</b>.

              If this option is not set, then rotated text will be set horizontally.

       <b>-S</b> <b>scale</b>
              Set the scale to which the figure is rendered.  This option automatically sets  the  <u>magnification</u>
              and <u>fsize</u> to <u>scale</u>/12 and <u>scale</u> respectively.  <u>Scale</u> must be between 8 and 12, inclusively.

       <b>-t</b> <b>stretch</b>
              Set the stretch factor of dashed lines to <u>stretch.</u>  The default is 30.

       <b>-v</b>     Include comments in the output file.

       <b>-W</b>     Enable variable line width.  By default, only two line widths are available: The normal line width
              ("<b>\thinlines</b>"), and thick lines ("<b>\thicklines</b>"). See also the <b>-l</b> option above.

       <b>-w</b>     Disable  variable line width. Only "<b>\thicklines</b>" and/or "<b>\thinlines</b>" commands will be generated in
              the output file.

              When variable line width option is enabled, the "<b>\thinlines</b>" command is still used when  the  line
              width is less than <u>LineThick</u>. One potential problem is that the width of "<b>\thinlines</b>" is 0.4pt but
              the  resolution  of Fig is 1/80 inch (approx. 1pt). If <u>LineThick</u> is set to 2, normal lines will be
              drawn in 0.4pt wide lines but the next line width is already 2pt. One possible solution is to  set
              <u>LineThick</u> to 1 and set the width of those lines you want to be drawn in "<b>\thinlines</b>"  to 0.

              Due to this problem, variable line width is disabled by default (<b>-w</b>).

</pre><h4><b>IBM-GL</b> <b>(HP/GL)</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       IBM-GL (IBM Graphics Language) is compatible with HP-GL (Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language).

       <b>-a</b>     Select ANSI A paper size instead of the default ISO A4.

       <b>-c</b>     Generate  instructions for an IBM 6180 Color Plotter without an IBM Graphics Enhancement Cartridge
              (IBM-GEC).

       <b>-d</b> <b>xll,yll,xur,yur</b>
              Restrict plotting to a rectangular area of the plotter paper which has a lower left hand corner at
              <u>(xll,yll)</u> and a upper right hand corner at <u>(xur,yur).</u>  All four numbers are in inches  and  follow
              <b>-d</b> in a comma-separated list - <u>xll,yll,xur,yur</u> - with no spaces between them.

       <b>-f</b> <b>fontfile</b>
              Load  text  character  specifications from the table in the file <u>fontfile</u>.  The table must have 36
              entries - one for each font plus a default.  Each entry consists of 5 numbers which specify the
              1.) standard character set (0 - 4, 6 - 9, 30 - 39),
              2.) alternate character set (0 - 4, 6 - 9, 30 - 39),
              3.) character slant angle (degrees),
              4.) character width scale factor and
              5.) character height scale factor.

       <b>-k</b>     Precede output with PCL command to use HP/GL.

       <b>-l</b> <b>pattfile</b>
              Load area fill line patterns from the table in the <u>pattfile</u> file.  The table must have 21  entries
              - one for each of the area fill patterns.  Each entry consists of 5 numbers which specify the
              1.) pattern number (-1 - 6),
              2.) pattern length (inches),
              3.) fill type (1 - 5),
              4.) fill spacing (inches) and
              5.) fill angle (degrees).

       <b>-P</b>     Rotate the figure to portrait mode. The default is landscape mode.

       <b>-p</b> <b>penfile</b>
              Load plotter pen specifications from the table in the <u>penfile</u> file.  The table must have 9 entries
              - one for each color plus a default.  Each entry consists of 2 numbers which specify the
              1.) pen number (1 - 8) and
              2.) pen thickness (millimeters).

       <b>-S</b> <b>speed</b>
              Set the pen speed to <u>speed</u> (centimeters/second).

       <b>-v</b>     Plot  the  figure upside-down in portrait mode or backwards in landscape mode.  This allows you to
              write on the top surface of overhead transparencies without disturbing  the  plotter  ink  on  the
              bottom surface.

       <b>-x</b> <b>offset</b>
              Shift figure left by <u>offset</u> inches.

       <b>-y</b> <b>offset</b>
              Shift figure up by <u>offset</u> inches.

       Fig2dev  may  be  installed  with  either ANSI A or ISO A4 default paper size.  The <b>-a</b> option selects the
       alternate paper size.  Fig2dev does not fill closed splines.  The  IBM-GEC  is  required  to  fill  other
       polygons.   Fig2dev may be installed for plotters with or without the IBM-GEC.  The <b>-c</b> option selects the
       alternate instruction set.

</pre><h4><b>LATEX</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       LaTeX cannot accurately represent all the graphics objects which can be described by Fig.   For  example,
       the  possible  slopes  which  lines may have are limited.  Some objects, such as spline curves, cannot be
       drawn at all.  Fig2latex chooses the closest possible line slope, and prints error messages when  objects
       cannot be drawn accurately.

       <b>-b</b> <b>borderwidth</b>
              Make blank border around figure of width <u>borderwidth</u> (1/72 inch).

       <b>-d</b> <b>dmag</b>
              Set a separate magnification for the length of line dashes to <u>dmag</u>.

       <b>-F</b>     Don't  set  the font face, series, and style; only set it's size and the baselineskip. By default,
              fig2dev sets all 5 font parameters when it puts some text. The disadvantage is that you can't  set
              the  font  from  your  LaTeX  document.  With this option on, you can set the font from your LaTeX
              document.

              If any of the pictures included in your LaTeX document  has  been  generated  with  <b>-F</b>,  then  all
              pictures must be generated with this option.

       <b>-f</b> <b>font</b>
              Set  the  default  font  used for text objects to <u>font</u>, where <u>font</u> is one of <u>rm</u>, <u>bf</u>, <u>it</u>, <u>sf</u> or <u>tt</u>.
              The default is <u>rm</u>.

       <b>-l</b> <b>lwidth</b>
              Sets the threshold between LaTeX thin and thick lines to <u>lwidth</u> pixels.  LaTeX supports  only  two
              different  line widths: \thinlines and \thicklines.  Lines of width greater than <u>lwidth</u> pixels are
              drawn as \thicklines.  Also affects the size of dots in dotted line style.  The default is 1.

       <b>-v</b>     Verbose mode. Include comments in the otput file.

</pre><h4><b>MAP</b> <b>(HTML</b> <b>image</b> <b>map)</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Xfig version 3.2.3 and later saves and allows the user to edit comments for each Fig object.  The fig2dev
       map output language will produce an HTML image map using Fig objects that have href="some_html_reference"
       in their comments.  Any Fig object except compound objects  may  be  used  for  this.   Usually,  besides
       generating the map file, you would also generate a PNG file, which is the image to which the map refers.

       For example, you may have an xfig drawing with an imported image that has the comment href="go_here.html"
       and  a  box object with a comment href="go_away.html".  This will produce an image map file such the user
       may click on the image and the browser will load the "go_here.html" page, or click on  the  box  and  the
       browser will load the "go_away.html" page.

       After  the  map  file  is  generated  by  <u>fig2dev</u>  you  will  need  to edit it to fill out any additional
       information it may need.

       <b>-b</b> <b>borderwidth</b>
              Make blank border around figure of width <u>borderwidth</u> (1/72 inch).

</pre><h4><b>METAFONT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Fig2dev</u> scales the figure by 1/8 before generating METAFONT  code.   The  magnification  can  be  further
       changed with the <b>-m</b> option or by giving magnification options to <b>mf</b>.

       In  order  to  process  the generated METAFONT code, the mfpic macros must be installed where <b>mf</b> can find
       them. The mfpic macro package is available at any CTAN cite under the subdirectory: graphics/mfpic

       <b>-C</b> <b>code</b>
              Specify the starting METAFONT font code. The default is 32.

       <b>-n</b> <b>name</b>
              Specify the name to use in the output file.

       <b>-p</b> <b>pen_magnification</b>
              Specify how much the line width should be magnified compared to the original figure.  The  default
              is 1.

       <b>-t</b> <b>top</b> Specify the top of the whole coordinate system.  The default is <b>ypos</b>.

       <b>-x</b> <b>xmin</b>
              Specify the minimum x coordinate value of the figure (inches). The default is 0.

       <b>-y</b> <b>ymin</b>
              Specify the minimum y coordinate value of the figure (inches). The default is 0.

       <b>-X</b> <b>xmax</b>
              Specify the maximum x coordinate value of the figure (inches). The default is 8.

       <b>-Y</b> <b>ymax</b>
              Specify the maximum y coordinate value of the figure (inches). The default is 8.

</pre><h4><b>METAPOST</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b> <b>file</b>
              Include file content as additional header.

       <b>-i</b> <b>file</b>
              Include file content via \input-command.

       <b>-M</b>     Multipage mode, generate one figure for each depth.

       <b>-o</b>     Old mode (no latex).

       <b>-p</b> <b>number</b>
              Adds the line "prologues:=number" to the output.

</pre><h4><b>PIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-f</b> <b>font</b>
              Set  the  default  font used for text objects to <u>font</u>, where <u>font</u> is one of <u>R</u> (roman), <u>B</u> (bold), <u>I</u>
              (italic), <u>H</u> (sans serif) or <u>C</u> (typewriter).  The default is <u>R</u>.

       <b>-p</b> <b>ext</b> Enables the use of certain PIC extensions  which  are  known  to  work  with  the  groff  package;
              compatibility with DWB PIC is unknown.  The extensions enabled by each option are:

           <b>arc</b>     Allow ARC_BOX i.e. use rounded corners
           <b>line</b>    Use the 'line_thickness' value
           <b>fill</b>    Allow ellipses to be filled
           <b>all</b>     Use all of the above
           <b>psfont</b>  Don't convert PostScript fonts generic type
                   (useful for files going to be Ditroff'ed for
                   and printed on PS printer). DWB-compatible.
           <b>allps</b>   Use all of the above (i.e. "all" + "psfont")

</pre><h4><b>PICT2E</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       PICT2E   is   an   enhancement   to   the   LaTeX   picture  environment.  It  is  enabled  by  inserting
       "<b>\usepackage{pict2e}</b>" in the document preamble. Depending on  the  content  of  the  figure,  it  may  be
       necessary  to  also  include  "<b>\usepackage{color}</b>" and "<b>\usepackage{graphics}</b>". Figures produced with the
       PICT2E driver can be processed with any LaTeX engine, e.g., LaTeX + dvips,  LaTeX  +  dvipdfm,  pdflatex,
       xelatex,  ConTeX,  etc.  Pattern fills are not supported by the PICT2E output language. The PICT2E driver
       renders patterns by filling the respective area with the pen-color at 25% intensity, i.e., a 75% tint  of
       the  pen-color.  The PICT2E driver allows one to choose any font available to the LaTeX engine, including
       PostScript fonts.  TeX an PostScript fonts may appear together in the same document.

       <b>-b</b> <b>borderwidth</b>
              Make blank border around figure of width <u>borderwidth</u>*(1/72) inches.

       <b>-C</b> <b>num</b> Do not emit a \color-command for the color number <b>num</b>. (0 = black, 1 = blue, 2 = green -  see  the
              color  chooser  widget  in Xfig).  By default, <u>fig2dev</u> does not issue a \color-command for objects
              which have the color set to "Default" in xfig.  With this option,  the  "\color"-command  is  also
              omitted  for objects having the color <b>num</b>.  The color of these objects, as well as of those having
              the color set to "Default", is picked up from the including LaTeX-document.

              The option <b>-C</b> <b>0</b> is particularly useful.  By default, xfig starts with  the  color  set  to  black.
              Then,  <u>fig2dev</u>  emits  "\color{black}"  commands,  and  the  color-package must be included in the
              document preamble.  For black text and black-and-white drawings, this is superfluous.

       <b>-e</b>     Do not try to be compatible with epic/eepic.  By default,  you  can  include  "<b>\usepackage{pict2e,</b>
              <b>epic,</b>  <b>eepic}</b>"  (in  this  order!)  in  the  document  preamble  and  mix LaTeX pictures using the
              epic/eepic command set and pictures produced with the PICT2E output language within one  document.
              With this option on, epic or eepic pictures can not be mixed with PICT2E-pictures.

              By  default,  <u>fig2dev</u>  avoids  the use of the "\circle" and "\oval"-commands, which are defined by
              epic, in lieu of the "\circlearc"-command exclusive to pict2e. In addition, line  widths  are  not
              only  set  using  "\linethickness",  but  also with the eepic-command "\allinethickness" (if it is
              defined).

       <b>-F</b>     Do not set the font family, series or shape.  By default, <u>fig2dev</u> sets the  font  family,  series,
              shape,  font  size  and  baselineskip.   With  this  option  on, the text font can be set from the
              including LaTeX-document, e.g., "<b>\itshape</b> <b>\input{fig1.pict2e}</b>".  See also <b>-o</b> (no font size).

       <b>-f</b> <b>font</b>
              Set the default font used for text objects to <u>font</u>.  The string <u>font</u> may be one of <u>rm</u>, <u>bf,</u> <u>it</u>, <u>sf</u>,
              <u>tt</u>, <u>\rmfamily</u>, <u>\bfseries</u>, <u>\itshape</u>, <u>\sffamily</u>, <u>\ttfamily</u>, or one of  the  35  standard  PostScript
              font names.  The default is <u>\rmfamily</u>.

       <b>-i</b> <b>dir</b> Prepend  the  string  <u>dir</u>  to graphics files included in the pict2e-picture.  For instance, having
              imported     "image.jpg"     in     xfig,     with     <b>-i</b>      <b>'$HOME/Figures/'</b>      the      code
              "\incudegraphics{$HOME/Figures/image.jpg}" will be generated.

       <b>-o</b>     Do not set the font size or baselineskip. Text will be rendered at the size that is in force where
              the pict2e-code is inserted into the LaTeX-document, e.g., "<b>\small</b> <b>\input{fig1.pict2e}</b>".  See also
              <b>-F</b> (no font properties).

       <b>-O</b>     Do  not  quote  characters special to TeX/LaTeX.  Useful to get, e.g., an italic <u>x</u>, not $x$, if it
              was forgotten to set the text flag "TeX" in xfig.  This option effectively sets the "TeX" flag for
              all text.

       <b>-P</b>     Pagemode, generate a stand-alone LaTeX-file as <u>out-file</u>. The document produced from the LaTeX-file
              will have the paper size equal to the figure's bounding box (but  see  the  <b>-b</b>  option  to  add  a
              margin).  The generated LaTeX-file calls the package "geometry.sty" to set the paper size.

       <b>-R</b> <b>num</b> Replace  arrowheads  <u>num</u>  by LaTeX-arrows ("\vector"). The number of an arrowhead ("Arrow Type" in
              xfig) can be found by opening the arrow chooser widget in xfig and counting the  arrows,  starting
              from  1.   For  instance,  to  replace filled triangle arrowheads with LaTeX \vector-commands, use
              <b>-R</b> <b>3</b>.

       <b>-r</b>     Replace all arrows by LaTeX-arrows.

       <b>-T</b>     Only use TeX fonts, even where PostScript-fonts are specified.

       <b>-v</b>     Verbose mode. Write comment lines into the output file, usually naming the type of the object that
              is drawn.

       <b>-w</b>     Remove the suffix from included graphics-files.  With this option on, <u>fig2dev</u> generates code  that
              contains, e.g., "<b>\includegraphics{fig1}</b>", instead of "<b>\includegraphics{fig1.eps}</b>".

</pre><h4><b>PICTEX</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In order to include PiCTeX pictures into a document, it is necessary to load the PiCTeX macros.

       PiCTeX  uses  TeX  integer  register arithmetic to generate curves, and so it is very slow.  PiCTeX draws
       curves by <b>\put</b>-ing the <u>psymbol</u> repeatedly, and so requires a large amount of TeX's internal  memory,  and
       generates  large DVI files.  The size of TeX's memory limits the number of plot symbols in a picture.  As
       a result, it is best to use PiCTeX to generate small pictures.

       <b>-f</b> <b>font</b>
              Set the default font used for text objects to <u>font</u>, where <u>font</u> is one of <u>rm</u>, <u>bf</u>,  <u>it</u>,  <u>sf</u>  or  <u>tt</u>.
              The default is <u>rm</u>.

       <b>-l</b> <b>dimen</b>
              Set line thickness to <u>dimen</u>. Default "1pt".

       <b>-p</b> <b>psymbol</b>
              Set the <u>psymbol</u>.  Default "\makebox(0,0)[l]{\tencirc\symbol{'160}}".

       <b>-r</b>     Do  not  allow  rotated  text.  Otherwise,  files  with  PiCTeX macros and rotated text need to be
              processed with <u>dvips</u>.

</pre><h4><b>GBX</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> <b>(Gerber,</b> <b>RS-247-X)</b></h4><pre>
       Typically you will wish to set the y scale to -1.  See <b>-g</b> for more information.

       <b>-d</b> <b>[mm|in]</b>
              Output dimensions should be assumed to be  millimeters  (mm)  or  inches  (in).   The  default  is
              millimeters.

       <b>-p</b> <b>[pos|neg]</b>
              Select the image polarity.  For positive images lines drawn in the fig file will generate lines of
              material.   For  negative  images  lines  drawn  in  the fig file will result in removed material.
              Consider etching a chrome on glass transmission mask.  Drawing lines in the fig file and  choosing
              'neg' will result in these lines being etched through the chrome, leaving transparent lines.

       <b>-g</b> <b>&lt;x</b> <b>scale&gt;x&lt;y</b> <b>scale&gt;+&lt;x</b> <b>offset&gt;+&lt;y</b> <b>offset&gt;</b>
              This  controls  the geometry of the output, scaling the dimensions as shown and applying the given
              offset.  Typically you will wish to set the y scale to -1, mirroring about the x  axis.   This  is
              because Gerber assumes the origin to be bottom left, while xfig selects top left.

       <b>-f</b> <b>&lt;n</b> <b>digits&gt;.&lt;n</b> <b>digits&gt;</b>
              This  controls the number of digits of precision before and after the implied decimal point.  With
              <b>-f</b> <b>5.3</b> the following number 12345678 corresponds to 12345.678.  Whereas with <b>-f</b> <b>3.5</b> it corresponds
              to 123.45678.  The default  is  for  3  places  before  the  decimal  point  and  5  after.   This
              corresponds, to a range of 0 to 1m in 10 micron increments.

       <b>-v</b>     Output  comments  describing  the  type  of  objects  being  output.  The text appears as comments
              starting with ## on each line in the output file.

</pre><h4><b>POSTSCRIPT,</b> <b>ENCAPSULATED</b> <b>POSTSCRIPT</b> <b>(EPS),</b> <b>and</b> <b>PDF</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       With PostScript, xfig can be used to create multiple page figures.  Specify the <b>-M</b> option  to  produce  a
       multi-page  output.   For  posters, add <b>-O</b> to overlap the pages slightly to get around the problem of the
       unprintable area in most printers, then cut and paste the pages together.  Great for text with  very  big
       letters.

       The EPS driver has the following differences from PostScript:
           o  No  showpage  is  generated  because  the  output  is meant to be imported into another program or
           document and not printed
           o The landscape/portrait options are ignored
           o The centering option is ignored
           o The multiple-page option is ignored
           o The paper size option is ignored
           o The x/y offset options are ignored

       The EPS driver has the following two special options:

       <b>-B</b> <b>'Wx</b> <b>[Wy</b> <b>X0</b> <b>Y0]'</b>
              This specifies that the bounding box of the EPS file should have the width <u>Wx</u> and the  height  <u>Wy</u>.
              Note  that  it doesn't scale the figure to this size, it merely sets the bounding box.  If a value
              less than or equal to 0 is specified for <u>Wx</u> or <u>Wy</u>, these are set to the width/height  respectively
              of  the  figure.   Origin  is  relative  to  screen  (0,0)  (upper-left).   <u>Wx</u>,  <u>Wy</u>, <u>X0</u> and <u>Y0</u> are
              interpreted in centimeters or inches depending on the measure given in the fig-file.  Remember  to
              put either quotes (") or apostrophes (') to group the arguments to <b>-B</b>.

       <b>-R</b> <b>'Wx</b> <b>[Wy</b> <b>X0</b> <b>Y0]'</b>
              Same  as  the  <b>-B</b> option except that <u>X0</u> and <u>Y0</u> is relative to the lower left corner of the <b>figure.</b>
              Remember to put either quotes (") or apostrophes (') to group the arguments to <b>-R</b>.

       The PDF driver accepts all of the PostScript options, if the <b>-P</b> (pagemode)  option  is  given.   In  this
       case,  the  size  of  the  PDF  is the pagesize given in the file or set from the command line via the <b>-z</b>
       option.  Otherwise, if <b>-P</b> is not given, the PDF is cropped to the bounding box of the figure  (optionally
       with a blank border margin set by the <b>-b</b> option), and all of the EPS options are supported.

       Text  can  now  include  various  ISO-character  codes  above 0x7f, which is useful for language specific
       characters to be printed directly.  Not all ISO-characters are implemented.

       Color support: Colored objects created by Fig can be printed on a color postscript printer. There are  32
       standard  colors:  black,  yellow, white, gold, five shades of blue, four shades of green, four shades of
       cyan, four shades of red, five shades of magenta, four shades of brown, and  four  shades  of  pink.   In
       addition there may be user-defined colors in the file.  See the xfig FORMAT3.2 file for the definition of
       these  colors.   On a monochrome printer, colored objects will be mapped into different grayscales by the
       printer.  Filled objects are printed using the given area fill and color.  There are  21  "shades"  going
       from  black  to full saturation of the fill color, and 21 more "tints" from full saturation + 1 to white.
       In addition, there are 16 patterns such as bricks, diagonal lines, crosshatch, etc.

       <b>-A</b>     Add an ASCII (EPSI) preview.  Not for PDF.

       <b>-b</b> <b>borderwidth</b>
              Make blank border around figure of width <u>borderwidth</u> (1/72 inch).

       <b>-C</b> <b>dummy_arg</b>
              Add a color *binary* TIFF preview for Microsoft products that need a binary preview.  See also  -T
              (monochrome  preview).   A  dummy  argument  must be supplied for historical reasons.  Not for PDF
              output.

       <b>-c</b>     Center the figure on the page.  The centering may not be  accurate  if  there  are  texts  in  the
              <u>fig_file</u> that extends too far to the right of other objects.

       <b>-e</b>     Put the figure against the edge (not centered) of the page.  Not available in EPS.

       <b>-F</b>     Use correct font sizes (points, 1/72 inch) instead of the traditional size that xfig/fig2dev uses,
              which is 1/80 inch.  The corresponding xfig command-line option is -correct_font_size.

       <b>-f</b> <b>font</b>
              Set  the  default  font  used  for  text  objects  to  <u>font</u>,  where <u>font</u> is one of the 35 standard
              PostScript font names.  The default is <u>Times-Roman</u>.

       <b>-g</b> <b>color</b>
              Use <u>color</u> for the background.

       <b>-j</b>     Enable composite fonts for text objects containing japanese or korean texts.  With this option  on
              and  if  your  environment  variable  LC_CTYPE  is  set  to  one of ja_JP.eucJP, ja_JP.EUC, ja_JP,
              ja_JP.ujis, ja, japanese, ko_KR.eucKR, ko_KR.EUC, ko_KR, ko, or  korean,  fig2dev  will  insert  a
              postscript  preamble  taken  from  the  fig2dev/i18n  directory  into  the  output file.  Japanese
              characters written with the Times-Roman font will then be taken from the fonts  Ryumin-Light-EUC-H
              or  HeiseiMin-W3-EUC-H,  japanese characters written with Times-Bold will be taken from GothicBBB-
              Medium-EUC-H.  For the korean locales, korean characters  appearing  in  text  objects  for  which
              Times-Roman  is  selected  will be taken from Munhwa-Regular-KSC-EUC-H or HLaTeX-Myoungjo-Regular-
              KSC-EUC-H. Korean characters in Times-Bold text will be taken from MunhwaGothic-Bold-KSC-EUC-H  or
              HLaTeX-Gothic-Regular-KSC-EUC-H.  Ghostscript must be able to find these fonts.

       <b>-l</b> <b>dummy_arg</b>
              Generate  figure in landscape mode.  The dummy argument is ignored, but must appear on the command
              line for reasons of compatibility.  This option will override the orientation specification in the
              file (for file versions 3.0 and higher).  Not available in EPS.

       <b>-M</b>     Generate multiple pages if figure exceeds paper size.  Not available in EPS.

       <b>-N</b>     Convert all colors to grayscale.

       <b>-n</b> <b>name</b>
              Set the Title part of the PostScript output to <u>name.</u>  This is useful when  the  input  to  <u>fig2dev</u>
              comes from standard input.

       <b>-O</b>     When  used  with <b>-M</b>, overlaps the pages slightly to get around the problem of the unprintable area
              in most printers.  Not available in EPS.

       <b>-p</b> <b>dummy_arg</b>
              Generate figure in portrait mode.  The dummy argument is ignored, but must appear on  the  command
              line for reasons of compatibility.  This option will override the orientation specification in the
              file  (for  file  versions  3.0  and higher).  This is the default for Fig files of version 2.1 or
              lower.  Not available in EPS.

       <b>-T</b>     Add a monochrome *binary* TIFF preview for Microsoft products that need  a  binary  preview.   See
              also <b>-C</b> (color preview).  Not available for PDF output.

       <b>-x</b> <b>offset</b>
              Shift  the  figure  in  the X direction by <u>offset</u> PostScript points (1/72 inch).  A negative value
              shifts the figure to the left and a positive value to the right.  Not available in EPS.

       <b>-y</b> <b>offset</b>
              Shift the figure in the Y direction by <u>offset</u> points (1/72 inch).  A  negative  value  shifts  the
              figure up and a positive value down.  Not available in EPS.

       <b>-z</b> <b>papersize</b>
              Set the papersize.  Not available in EPS.
              Available paper sizes are:
                  <u>Letter</u>    (8.5" x 11" also <u>A</u>),
                  <u>Legal</u>     ( 11" x 14")
                  <u>Ledger</u>    ( 11" x 17"),
                  <u>Tabloid</u>   ( 17" x 11", really <u>Ledger</u> in Landscape mode),
                  <u>A</u>         (8.5" x 11" also <u>Letter</u>),
                  <u>B</u>         ( 11" x 17" also <u>Ledger</u>),

</pre><h4><b>PSTEX</b> <b>and</b> <b>PDFTEX</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>pstex</b> and <b>pdftex</b> languages are a variant of <b>ps</b> which suppress text that has the text flag "TeX Text"
       set.  The <b>pstex_t</b> and <b>pdftex_t</b> languages have the complementary behavior: they  generate  only  the  text
       that has the "Tex Text" flag set and the commands necessary to position this text. They also generate the
       commands necessary to overlay the PostScript or PDF file generated using <b>pstex</b>/<b>pdftex</b>.  These two drivers
       can  be  used  to generate a figure which combines the flexibility of PostScript graphics with LaTeX text
       formatting of text flagged as "TeX Text".

       The pstex and pdftex drivers accept the same options that the EPS driver accepts.

       <b>-n</b> <b>name</b>
              Set the Title part of the PostScript output to <u>name.</u>  This is useful when  the  input  to  <u>fig2dev</u>
              comes from standard input.

</pre><h4><b>PSTEX_T</b> <b>and</b> <b>PDFTEX_T</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>pstex_t</b>  and <b>pdftex_t</b> languages produce only the text flagged with the "TeX Text" flag, the commands
       necessary to position this text, and the commands  necessary  to  overlay  the  PostScript  or  PDF  file
       generated using <b>pstex</b> or <b>pdftex</b> (see above).

       <b>-F</b>     Don't  set  the font face, series, and style; only set it's size and the baselineskip. By default,
              fig2dev sets all 5 font parameters when it puts some text. The disadvantage is that you can't  set
              the  font  from  your  LaTeX  document.  With this option on, you can set the font from your LaTeX
              document (like "<b>\sfshape</b> <b>\input</b> <b>picture.eepic</b>").

       <b>-p</b> <b>file</b>
              specifies the name of the PostScript file to be overlaid.  If not set or its value is null then no
              PS file will be inserted.

</pre><h4><b>PSTricks</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>PSTricks</b> driver provides full <b>LaTeX</b> text and math formatting for  XFig  drawings  without  overlaying
       separate  outputs  as  in  the <b>PSTEX</b> methods.  The output matches the quality of output of the PostScript
       driver except for text, where the <b>Latex</b> font selection mechanism is  used  as  for  other  <u>fig2dev</u>  LaTeX
       drivers.  In addition, text is rendered black, although font color-changing <b>LaTex</b> code can be embedded in
       the drawing.  The generated PSTricks code is meant to  be  readable.   Each  command  stands  alone,  not
       relying  on  global  option  state  variables.  Thus the user can easily use XFig to rough out a PSTricks
       drawing, then finish by hand editing.

       To use the driver's output, give the command "<b>\usepackage{pstricks}</b>"  in  your  document  preamble.   The
       <b>graphicx</b>  and <b>pstricks-add</b> packages may also be required.  The former is used for bitmap graphics and the
       second for complex line styles and/or hollow PSTricks arrows (with the -R 1  option).   The  driver  will
       tell  you  which  packages  are  needed.  In the document body, include the figure with "<b>\input{pstfile}</b>"
       where <b>pstfile.tex</b> is the output file.  Use the <b>XFig</b> <b>TeX</b> <b>text</b> flag to have text  passed  as-is  to  LaTeX.
       For  non-TeX text, the same mechanism as the LaTeX and epic driver mechanism is used to match font specs,
       but this is imprecise.

       <b>Known</b> <b>bugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>limitations.</b>
              PSTricks support for join styles is version dependent. Raw postscript is inserted with  "<b>\pstVerb</b>"
              for  old  versions  when other than angle joins are needed.  The <b>-t</b> option controls this behavior.
              PSTricks does not support rotated ellipses directly, so a <b>rput</b> command is emitted that rotates and
              locates a horizontal ellipse.  This makes a problem with  hatch  patterns,  which  are  moved  and
              rotated  along with the ellipse.  Hatch rotation is fixed by a counter-rotation, but the origin is
              not adjusted, so registration with adjacent hatch patterns  will  be  incorrect.   Flipped  bitmap
              graphics  use  an  undocumented feature of the <b>graphicx</b> package: a negative height flips the image
              vertically.  This appears to work reliably.  However, you may want to flip graphics  with  another
              program  before  including  them in <b>Xfig</b> drawings just to be sure.  With the <b>-p</b> option, the driver
              attempts to convert non-EPS pictures to EPS with the TeX distribution's <b>bmeps</b> program,  but  <b>bmeps</b>
              does not know about very many file formats including <b>gif</b>.

       <b>-f</b> <b>font</b>
              Set  the  default  font  used for text objects to <u>font</u>, where <u>font</u> is one of <u>rm</u>, <u>bf</u>, <u>it</u>, <u>sf</u> or <u>tt</u>.
              The default is <u>rm</u>.

       <b>-G</b> <b>dummy_arg</b>
              Draws a standard PSTricks grid in light gray, ignoring the size parameters, numbered  in  PSTricks
              units.

       <b>-l</b> <b>weight</b>
              Sets  a line weight factor that is multiplied by the actual Fig line width.  The default value 0.5
              roughly matches the output of the PS driver.

       <b>-n</b> <b>0|1|2|3</b>
              Sets environment type.  Default 0  creates  a  <b>\picture</b>  environment  with  bounding  box  exactly
              enclosing  the picture (but see <b>-x</b> and <b>-y</b> ).  A 1 emits bare PSTricks commands with no environment
              at all, which can be used with <b>\input{commands}</b> inside  an  existing  <b>\pspicture</b>.   A  2  emits  a
              complete  LaTeX  document.   A  3  also  emits  a  complete LaTeX document but attempts to set the
              PSTricks unit to fit a 7.5 by 10 inch (portrait aspect) box.

       <b>-P</b>     Shorthand for <b>-n</b> <b>3</b>.

       <b>-p</b> <b>dir</b> Attempts to run the <b>bmeps</b> program to  translate  picture  files  to  EPS,  which  is  required  by
              PSTricks.   The  translated files go in <u>dir</u> , which must already exist (the driver will not create
              it). Moreover, (BIG CAVEAT HERE) the driver overwrites files  with  impunity  in  this  directory!
              Don't  put  your  stuff  here.   The  <b>includegraphics</b>  commands  in  the output file refer to this
              directory.  Even if the -p option is not used, <b>includegraphics</b>  commands  follow  this  convention
              with  the default directory <u>./eps</u> <u>.</u>  In this case, the user must do the conversions independently.
              The <b>bmeps</b> program is part of the standard TeX distribution. It converts the following  formats  to
              EPS: <b>png</b> <b>jpg</b> <b>pnm</b> <b>tif.</b>  You can see the bmeps command with the <b>-v</b> option.

       <b>-R</b> <b>0|1|2</b>
              Sets arrow style.  With the default style 0, Fig arrows are converted to lines and polygons.  With
              style  1, the Fig arrowhead dimensions are converted to PSTricks arrowhead dimensions and PSTricks
              arrowhead options are emitted.  Hollow arrows will require the  additional  package  <b>pstricks-add</b>.
              With style 2, PSTricks arrowhead options are emitted with no dimensions at all, and arrowhead size
              may be controlled globally with <b>psset</b>.

       <b>-S</b> <b>scale</b>
              Scales the image according to the same convention as the EPIC driver, i.e., to size <u>scale</u>/12.

       <b>-t</b> <b>version</b>
              Provides the driver with PSTricks version number so output can match expected LaTeX input.

       <b>-v</b>     Print  verbose warnings and extra comments in the output file.  Information provided includes font
              substitution details, the <b>bmeps</b> commands used for picture conversion, if any, and one comment  per
              Fig object in the output.

       <b>-x</b> <b>marginsize</b>
              Adds  <u>marginsize</u>  on the left and right of the <b>PStricks</b> bounding box.  By default, the box exactly
              encloses the image.

       <b>-y</b> <b>marginsize</b>
              Adds <u>marginsize</u> on the top and bottom of the <b>PStricks</b> bounding box.  By default, the  box  exactly
              encloses the image.

       <b>-z</b> <b>0|1|2</b>
              Sets  font  handling option.  Default option 0 attempts to honor Fig font names and sizes, finding
              the best match with a standard LaTeX font.  Option 1 sets LaTeX font size only.  Option  2  issues
              no font commands at all.

</pre><h4><b>TEXTYL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-f</b> <b>font</b>
              Set  the  default  font  used for text objects to <u>font</u>, where <u>font</u> is one of <u>rm</u>, <u>bf</u>, <u>it</u>, <u>sf</u> or <u>tt</u>.
              The default is <u>rm</u>.

       <b>-l</b> <b>lwidth</b>
              Set the line thickness. <u>lwidth</u> must be a value between 1 and 12.

</pre><h4><b>TIKZ</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       TIKZ is a powerful frontend to the Portable Graphics Format (PGF) for TeX/LaTeX.  To use figures  created
       by  the  TIKZ  driver in a LaTeX document, use "<b>\usepackage{tikz}</b>" and, depending on the contents of your
       figure, "<b>\usetikzlibrary{arrows.meta,</b> <b>bending}</b>" and "<b>\usetikzlibrary{patterns}</b>" in the document preamble.
       Simply \input or copy the output file into the TeX-document.  TIKZ  files  produced  by  <u>fig2dev</u>  may  be
       included  into  a  plain TeX document.  However, the stand-alone file produced with the <b>-P</b> option must be
       processed with a LaTeX-engine.  In addition, font-commands may require a LaTeX engine.

       <b>-b</b> <b>borderwidth</b>
              Make blank border around figure of width <u>borderwidth</u>*(1/72) inches.

       <b>-C</b> <b>num</b> Do not emit a \color-command for the color number <b>num</b>. (0 = black, 1 = blue, 2 = green -  see  the
              color  chooser  widget  in Xfig).  By default, <u>fig2dev</u> does not issue a \color-command for objects
              which have the color set to "Default" in xfig.  With this option,  the  "\color"-command  is  also
              omitted  for objects having the color <b>num</b>.  The color of these objects, as well as of those having
              the color set to "Default", is picked up from the including document.

       <b>-F</b>     Do not set the font family, series or shape.  By default, <u>fig2dev</u> sets the  font  family,  series,
              shape,  font size and baselineskip.  As a side effect, this requires the New Font Selection Scheme
              (NFSS) of LaTeX.  With this option on, the text font can be set from the including document, which
              may be TeX or LaTeX.  See also <b>-o</b> (no font size).

       <b>-f</b> <b>font</b>
              Set the default font used for text objects to <u>font</u>.  The string <u>font</u> may be one of <u>rm</u>, <u>bf,</u> <u>it</u>, <u>sf</u>,
              <u>tt</u>, <u>\rmfamily</u>, <u>\bfseries</u>, <u>\itshape</u>, <u>\sffamily</u>, <u>\ttfamily</u>, or one of  the  35  standard  PostScript
              font names.  The default is <u>\rmfamily</u>.

       <b>-i</b> <b>dir</b> Prepend  the  string  <u>dir</u>  to  graphics  files included in the tikz-picture.  For instance, having
              imported  "image.jpg"  in  xfig,  with  <b>-</b>  <b>i</b>  <b>'$HOME/Figures/'</b>  the   code   "\pgfimage[width=...,
              height=...]{$HOME/Figures/image.jpg}" will be generated.

       <b>-O</b>     Do  not  quote  characters special to TeX/LaTeX.  Useful to get, e.g., an italic <u>x</u>, not $x$, if it
              was forgotten to set the text-flag "TeX" in xfig.  This option effectively sets the "TeX" flag for
              all text.

       <b>-o</b>     Do not set the font size or baselineskip. Text will be rendered at the size that is in force where
              the tikz-code is inserted into the document, e.g., "<b>\small\input</b> <b>fig1.tikz</b>".  See also <b>-F</b> (no font
              properties).

       <b>-P</b>     Pagemode, generate a stand-alone LaTeX-file as <u>out-file</u>.  Run <u>out-file</u> through LaTeX to generate a
              pdf or eps of the figure.  The document produced from <u>out-file</u> will have the paper size  equal  to
              the  figure's bounding box (but see the <b>-b</b> option to add a margin).  The package "geometry.sty" is
              used in <u>out-file</u> to set the paper size.

       <b>-T</b>     Only use TeX fonts, even where PostScript-fonts are specified.

       <b>-v</b>     Verbose mode. Write comment lines into the output file, usually naming the type of the object that
              is drawn.

       <b>-W</b>     Do not emit code at the beginning of the file that allows one to set the figure  width  or  height
              from  the  including  TeX  document.   Otherwise, e.g., "<b>\newdimen\XFigwidth\XFigwidth=\linewidth</b>"
              would scale the following figures to the line width.

       <b>-w</b>     Remove the suffix from included graphics-files.  With this option on, <u>fig2dev</u> generates code  that
              contains, e.g., "<b>\pgfimage{fig1}</b>" instead of "<b>\pgfimage{fig1.pdf}</b>".

</pre><h4><b>TK</b> <b>and</b> <b>PTK</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> <b>(tcl/tk</b> <b>and</b> <b>Perl/tk)</b></h4><pre>
       Arc-boxes  are not supported for the tk output language, and only X bitmap pictures are supported because
       of the canvas limitation in tk.
       Picture objects are not scaled with the magnification factor for tk output.
       Because tk scales canvas items according to the X display resolution, polygons, lines, etc. may be scaled
       differently than imported pictures (bitmaps) which aren't scaled at all.

       <b>-g</b> <b>color</b>
              Use <u>color</u> for the background.

       <b>-l</b> <b>dummy_arg</b>
              Generate figure in landscape mode.  The dummy argument is ignored, but must appear on the  command
              line for reasons of compatibility.  This option will override the orientation specification in the
              file (for file versions 3.0 and higher).

       <b>-p</b> <b>dummy_arg</b>
              Generate  figure  in portrait mode.  The dummy argument is ignored, but must appear on the command
              line for reasons of compatibility.  This option will override the orientation specification in the
              file (for file versions 3.0 and higher).  This is the default for Fig  files  of  version  2.1  or
              lower.

       <b>-P</b>     Generate  canvas  of full page size instead of using the bounding box of the figure's objects. The
              default is to use only the bounding box.

       <b>-w</b>     Wrap the figure with code in order to generate a complete perl file.  That is, you can do  <b>fig2dev</b>
              <b>-L</b>  <b>ptk</b>  <b>-w</b>  <b>f.fig</b> <b>f.pl;</b> <b>perl</b> <b>f.pl</b> and a widget pops up that shows the graphics contained in f.pl.
              Only available for ptk output.

       <b>-z</b> <b>papersize</b>
              Set the paper size.  See the POSTSCRIPT OPTIONS for available paper sizes.  This is only used when
              the <b>-P</b> option (use full page) is used.

</pre><h4><b>TPIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-f</b> <b>font</b>
              Set the default font used for text objects to <u>font</u>.  The default is <u>rm</u>.  The string  <u>font</u>  can  be
              one  of  <u>rm</u>,  <u>bf</u>,  <u>it</u>,  <u>sf</u>,  <u>tt</u>,  <u>avant</u>,  <u>avantcsc</u>, <u>avantd</u>, <u>avantdi</u>, <u>avanti</u>, <u>bookd</u>, <u>bookdi</u>, <u>bookl</u>,
