</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fig2ps,  fig2eps,fig2pdf  -  Convert xfig files in ps|pdf, processing all the text marked as special with
       LaTeX.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fig2ps</b> [<b>-h</b>|<b>--help</b>]

       <b>fig2ps</b> [ <u>options</u> ] <u>file1.fig</u> [<u>file2.fig</u> <u>...</u>]

       <b>fig2pdf</b> [ <u>options</u> ] <u>file1.fig</u> [<u>file2.fig</u> <u>...</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fig2ps</b> converts figures produced by XFig into postscript or PDF, processing the text with LaTeX. It takes
       advantage of the <u>pstex</u> and <u>pstext_t</u> export formats of <b>fig2dev</b>.

       <b>fig2ps</b> converts successively all the files given as arguments. It's behaviour is governed by quite a  few
       options. In all the options, the <b>=</b> sign is optional, so that

       <u>fig2ps</u> <u>--bbox=dvips</u> <u>file.fig</u>

       and

       <u>fig2ps</u> <u>--bbox</u> <u>dvips</u> <u>file.fig</u>

       are equivalent.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To convert <u>file.fig</u> to PS:

       <u>fig2ps</u> <u>file.fig</u>

       To convert it to PDF:

       <u>fig2pdf</u> <u>file.fig</u>

       or

       <u>fig2ps</u> <u>--pdf</u> <u>file.fig</u>

       If the XFig file you want to convert to PDF contains included images, you might want to try:

       <u>fig2pdf</u> <u>--manual-ps2pdf</u> <u>file.fig</u>

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--gv,</b> <b>--nogv</b>
           If  on,  <b>fig2ps</b> runs <b>gv</b> on every file just after they are produced. On by default if <b>fig2ps</b> thinks it
           is talking to a terminal (ie not from a pipe). You might want to switch that off when processing lots
           of files.

       <b>--xpdf</b>
           Views produced files with <b>xpdf</b> rather than <b>gv</b>.  Obviously, that won't be really  useful  if  you  are
           producing PS files, you've been warned.

       <b>--viewer</b><u>=command</u>
           Runs <u>command</u> rather than <b>gv</b> on the produced files.

       <b>--keep</b>
           Tells  <b>fig2ps</b>  to  keep  the  temporary  directory  in  which temporary files are created. Useful for
           debugging. If this option is on, <b>fig2ps</b> prints the name of the directory when  it  has  finished  its
           job, so you know where to look.

       <b>--packages</b><u>=pack1,pack2,...</u>
           Sets  the package list to be used to <u>pack1,pack2,...</u>.  Resets any package given by the <b>--add</b> command-
           line option. For more information about packages, see the section <b>PREAMBLE</b> below.

       <b>--add</b><u>=pack1,pack2,...</u>
           Adds <u>pack1,pack2,...</u>  to the existing list of packages. See the section <b>PREAMBLE</b> below.  This  option
           is cumulative.

       <b>--bbox</b><u>=dvips|gs|a,b,c,d</u>
           Chooses the method to determine the bounding box of the files. See the section <b>BOUNDING</b> <b>BOX</b> below for
           more information.

       <b>--input</b><u>=file</u>
           Uses  file  as a template for the LaTeX file. More information about that can be found in the section
           <b>PREAMBLE</b> below. This option was written for a private use, though you can of course profit  from  it.
           However,  most  of  the  times,  what  you  really want is <u>--add=file</u>.  <u>file</u> will be looked for using
           <b>kpsewhich</b>.

       <b>--pdf,</b> <b>--nopdf</b>
           Whether the final output of <b>fig2ps</b> will be PDF or  postscript.  This  option  is  automatically  when
           called  as  <b>fig2pdf</b>.   Note that in any case, <b>fig2ps</b> has to go through Postscript output to produce a
           PDF file.

       <b>--eps</b>
           Change the output default extension from <u>.ps</u> to <u>.eps</u>.  This is on by  default  when  the  program  is
           called as <b>fig2eps</b>.  It has no other effects.

       <b>--manual-ps2pdf</b>
           When  producing  PDF  files,  <b>fig2ps</b>  uses  <b>epstopdf</b>  to perform the conversion. This may lead to bad
           quality output with embedded pictures. The use of this option disables PDF production by <b>epstopdf</b> and
           lets <b>ps2pdf</b> produce the final output PDF (but  after  tweaking  the  PS  file  using  <b>epstopdf</b>).   In
           general, this produces much better results.

       <b>--ps2pdf-options</b>
           When  <u>--manual-ps2pdf</u>  does not produce output of decent quality, you can use this option to manually
           feed options to <b>ps2pdf</b>.  The use of this option implies <u>--manual-ps2pdf</u>.

       <b>--keepps</b>
           When producing a PDF file, asks <b>fig2ps</b> to keep the intermediary Postscript file.

       <b>--forcespecial,</b> <b>--noforcespecial</b>
           <b>fig2ps</b> only processes with LaTeX text which is marked as <u>special</u> in the Fig file. When this option is
           on, all text is treated as if it was marked with the <u>special</u> flag.

       <b>--dvips</b><u>=string</u>
           Passes <u>string</u> as options for <b>dvips</b>.

       <b>--fig2dev</b><u>=string</u>
           Passes <u>string</u> as options for <b>fig2dev</b>.

       <b>--preamble</b><u>=string</u>
           Adds <u>string</u> in the preamble of the LaTeX file generated, just  before  the  <u>\begin{document}</u>  stanza.
           Effects are cumulative.

       <b>-V</b>,  <b>--version</b>
           Prints the version of <b>fig2ps</b> and exits.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Many of the command-line options can be set in either the system-wide (in <u><a href="file:/etc">/etc</a></u>) or the user configuration
       file  (in  the  user's  home  directory). Some more details can be configured in the configuration files.
       Global configuration is overridden by users' configuration which in turn is  overridden  by  the  command
       line options.  Here is a list of the variables you can define:

       <b>PACKAGES</b><u>=pack1,pack2...</u>
           Defines the basic list of packages. See the <b>PREAMBLE</b> section.

       <b>ADD</b><u>=pack1,pack2</u>
           Has  the  same  effect  as  the <b>--add</b> command-line option. Does not make too much sense in the global
           configuration file, but you might want to use it in a personal one.

       <b>DOC_CLASS</b><u>=class</u>
           Sets the document class used by LaTeX.

       <b>DOC_OPTIONS</b><u>=Ioptions</u>
           Sets the options for the document class.

       <b>FORCE_SPECIAL</b><u>=0</u>|<u>1</u>
           Sets the default for option <b>--forcespecial</b>.

       <b>GV</b><u>=0</u>|<u>1</u>
           Sets the default for option <b>--gv</b>.

       <b>GV</b><u>=file</u>
           Has the same effect as the <b>--input</b> command-line option.

       <b>PREAMBLE</b><u>=string</u>
           Identical to the <b>--preamble</b> option, with the slight difference that the in configuration files, it is
           not cumulative: the last assignment seen is the only taken into account.

       <b>KEEP_PS</b><u>=0</u>|<u>1</u>
           Sets the default for option <b>--keepps</b>.

</pre><h4><b>PREAMBLE</b></h4><pre>
       The preamble of the LaTeX file is built as such:

       <b>*</b> if a <b>--input</b> file is specified, it will be used directly with  a  <u>\input</u>  statement.  A  <u>\documentclass</u>
         statement will be added if the input file does not contain any.

       <b>*</b> else,  a  preamble  is  made based on the values of <b>DOC_CLASS</b>, <b>DOC_OPTIONS</b>, and <b>PACKAGES</b> (the latter is
         overridden by the <b>--packages</b> command-line option). See below for the format of the package variables.

       Then, the packages specified using the <b>ADD</b> variable and the <b>--add</b> command-line options are added  to  the
       preamble,  followed  by  the <u>geometry</u> package that deals with setting the size of the output (tweaked for
       <b>fig2ps</b>'s purposes) and finally the contents of the <b>PREAMBLE</b>  variable  and  the  <b>--preamble</b>  command-line
       options.

       The  <b>--packages</b>  and  <b>--add</b>  options,  and  the  corresponding  variables, take a comma separated list of
       packages. Options for the packages can be specified in two ways:

       <u>[option]package</u>
           in which you can only specify one option;

       <u>option1:option2:...:package</u>
           in which you can specify an arbitrary number of options, as long as you don't need a comma inside  an
           option. Should the need arise, use <b>--preamble</b>.

</pre><h4><b>BOUNDING</b> <b>BOX</b></h4><pre>
       One of the delicate jobs of <b>fig2ps</b> is to set the bounding box of the produced file, that is the rectangle
       that holds the figure. There are basically three ways for <b>fig2ps</b> to get them:

       <u>dvips</u>
           In this mode, <b>fig2ps</b> runs <b>dvips</b> with the <u>-E</u> option. It works reasonably fine most of the time, but it
           will produce incorrect results if you have rotated text near the edge of the graph.

       <u>gs</u>  Asks  <b>gs</b>  to  tell the bounding box of the figure. It used to produce systematically perfect results,
           but the quality has degraded somehow recently. It still works in most of the cases, and that  is  why
           it is the default. It fails on very large pictures.

       <u>a,b,c,d</u>
           Specify your bounding box by hand.

       The  benefits  of  using  the  last  two  methods  is  that  <b>fig2ps</b>  tells you how big the picture is (in
       centimeters).

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/fig2ps/fig2ps.rc</u>, <u>$HOME/.fig2ps.rc</u>

       The <u>examples/</u> directory in the source tarball contains some examples. Check <b>fig2ps</b> on them to see  if  it
       works fine, but keep in mind that <b>fig2ps</b> will choke on <u>examples/Large-example.fig</u> !

       This  script  was  written by Vincent Fourmond, from an original idea of Seb Desreux (the first script is
       for private use, and used the eepic export of xfig, which is  severely  limitated),  improved  by  a  few
       others...
