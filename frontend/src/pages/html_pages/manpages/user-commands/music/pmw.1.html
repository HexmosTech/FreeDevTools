</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pmw - a program for typesetting music

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pmw</b> <b>[options]</b> <b>[input</b> <b>file]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>

       PMW  (Philip's  Music  Writer)  is  a  program  for  typesetting music. It is not an interactive program;
       instead, it reads a description of the music from a textual input file, which can be prepared by any text
       editor. The output from PMW is a PostScript file of page images of typeset music. This  output  uses  the
       PMW-Music  PostScript font, which must therefore be available for viewing, printing, or converting to PDF
       by an application such as GhostScript. A secondary output in the form of a MIDI file can be requested.

       A full description of PMW and its markup language is given in the reference manual. This  man  page  just
       summarizes the command line options.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>-a4ona3</b>   The pages are A4-sized; print them 2-up, assuming A3 paper.

       <b>-a5ona4</b>   The pages are A5-sized; print them 2-up, assuming A4 paper.

       <b>-a4sideways</b>
                 The paper is A4, but the printer feeds it sideways, so rotate the page images before printing.

       <b>-C</b> <u>&lt;arg&gt;</u>  Show a compile-time option; exit with its value (0 or 1). Possible arguments are:

                   b2pf      suport for B2PF processing
                   musicxml  support for MusicXML input

       <b>-c</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
                 Arrange to print <u>&lt;number&gt;</u> copies. This number is honoured by PostScript printers. It may not be
                 honoured by other programs that interpret PostScript.

       <b>-d&lt;</b><u>options</u>&gt;
                 Write  general  debugging  information  to  stderr.  This  option is of use only to the program
                 maintainer.

       <b>-dbd</b> [[<u>&lt;movement&gt;</u>,]<u>&lt;stave&gt;</u>,]<u>&lt;bar&gt;</u>
                 Write debugging data for the bar to  stderr.  This  option  is  of  use  only  to  the  program
                 maintainer.

       <b>-drawbarlines</b>
                 Instead of using characters from the music font to print bar lines, generate PostScript drawing
                 instructions.  Some  PostScript  interpreters  do  not  display  the  font  bar line characters
                 correctly on the screen when several of them are used to generate a long vertical line; drawing
                 them instead may give a better result. <b>-dbl</b> is an abbreviation for <b>-drawbarlines</b>.

       <b>-drawstavelines</b> [<u>&lt;thickness&gt;</u>]
                 Instead of using characters from the music font  to  print  stave  lines,  generate  PostScript
                 drawing  instructions.  Some  PostScript  interpreters do not display the font stave characters
                 correctly on the screen; drawing them instead may give a better result. The  default  thickness
                 of  drawn  stave  lines  is  0.3  points,  scaled  according to relative stave size and overall
                 magnification. An integer number given with this option specifies the thickness in tenths of  a
                 point.  <b>-dsl</b> is an abbreviation for <b>-drawstavelines</b>.

       <b>-dtp</b> <u>&lt;bar&gt;</u>
                 Write debugging positioning data for the bar to stderr. If there is more than one movement (not
                 likely  while debugging at this level), the data is output for every bar with the given number.
                 If the number is -1, data is output for all bars. This option is of use  only  to  the  program
                 maintainer.

       <b>-duplex</b>   This option sets the PostScript option for duplex printing (see also <b>-tumble</b>).

       <b>-eps</b>      Write the output as encapsulated PostScript (useful if this is an illustration that is going to
                 be included in some other document).

       <b>-errormaximum</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
                 Set the maximum number of errors before the program gives up. The default is 40. This option is
                 provided  mainly  so  that  an  error  test  can  generate  a large number of errors. <b>-em</b> is an
                 abbreviation for <b>-errormaximum</b>.

       <b>-F</b> <u>&lt;directory-list&gt;</u>
                 Search the given colon-separated list of directories for fontmetrics  files,  before  searching
                 the  default directory that was set up when PMW was built.  These directories are also searched
                 for optional Unicode translation (.utr)  files  for  fonts  that  do  not  use  Adobe  standard
                 encoding,  and for any special text fonts (.pfa files) that are requested to be included in the
                 output.

       <b>-f</b> <u>&lt;name&gt;</u> Specifies a format name, used when the input file is set up  to  output  in  several  different
                 formats.

       <b>-H</b> <u>&lt;file&gt;</u> Use  the  given file as the PostScript header file, instead of the default that was set up when
                 PMW was built.

       <b>-help</b> or <b>--help</b>
                 Output a list of options, then stop. No file is read.

       <b>-incPMWfont</b> or <b>-incpmwfont</b> or <b>-ipf</b>
                 This option causes PMW to  include  the  music  font  within  the  PostScript  output  that  it
                 generates.  (If  the  PMW-Alpha  font  is used, that is also included.) If you use this option,
                 there is no need to install the PMW  music  font(s)  for  GhostScript  (or  any  other  display
                 program) to find.

       <b>-MF</b> <u>&lt;directory&gt;</u>
                 Search  the  given  colon-separated list of directories for PMW's music fonts, before searching
                 the default directory that was set up when PMW was built.

       <b>-MP</b> <u>&lt;file&gt;</u>
                 Use the given file as the MIDIperc file, instead of the default that was set up  when  PMW  was
                 built. This file translates between names and "pitches" for untuned percussion voices.

       <b>-MV</b> <u>&lt;file&gt;</u>
                 Use  the given file as the MIDIvoices file, instead of the default that was set up when PMW was
                 built. This file translates voice names to MIDI voice numbers.

       <b>-manualfeed</b>
                 Set the `manualfeed' option in the generated PostScript.  Most  PostScript  printers  interpret
                 this  to  mean  that  the paper should be taken from an alternate input tray or slot. Some also
                 require the user to push a button before each page is printed.

       <b>-midi</b> <u>&lt;file&gt;</u>
                 Write MIDI output to the given file (in addition to the normal PostScript  output).  The  stave
                 selection (see <b>-s</b> below) also applies to MIDI output.

       <b>-midibars</b> <u>&lt;range&gt;</u>
                 If  <b>-midi</b>  is given, write only the given bars to the MIDI output. The range can be two numbers
                 separated by a hyphen or a single number for just one bar. A single number followed by a hyphen
                 plays from that bar to the end of the movement. <b>-mb</b> is an abbreviation for <b>-midibars</b>.

       <b>-midimovement</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
                 For a multi-movement input file, this specifies the movement that is to be output as MIDI  when
                 <b>-midi</b> is given. The default is the first movement.  <b>-mm</b> is an abbreviation for <b>-midimovement</b>.

       <b>-noid</b>     Do  not  show  version  number  for error output. This is useful to a maintainer when comparing
                 output from different versions.

       <b>-norc</b> or <b>-nopmwrc</b>
                 Do not read the caller's <u>.pmwrc</u> file. This must be the first option given.

       <b>-norepeats</b>
                 When generating a MIDI output file, do not repeat repeated sections of the  music.  <b>-nr</b>  is  an
                 abbreviation for <b>-norepeats</b>.

       <b>-nowidechars</b>
                 This  option  stops  PMW  from  using the 100-point wide stave characters when printing staves.
                 Instead, staves are constructed entirely from the 10-point  wide  characters.  This  option  is
                 provided because it seems that some PostScript interpreters cannot deal correctly with the very
                 wide  characters. <b>-nw</b> is an abbreviation for <b>-nowidechars</b>. The <b>-drawstavelines</b> option overrides
                 this option.

       <b>-o</b> <u>&lt;file&gt;</u> Send the output to the given file, or, if "-" is given, to stdout. The default file name is the
                 input file with the extension ".ps" replacing any existing extension, or being added  if  there
                 is no extension. If there is no input file (input from stdin) the default output is to stdout.

       <b>-p</b> <u>&lt;list&gt;</u> Output  only  the  specified  pages.  These can be individual page numbers, or pairs of numbers
                 separated by a hyphen, to specify a range. Use commas to separate items in the list.

       <b>-pamphlet</b> Output pages in pamphlet order. This is usually used in conjunction with <b>-a5ona4</b> or <b>-a4ona3</b>.

       <b>-printadjust</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> <u>&lt;y&gt;</u>
                 Move the image on the page by (<u>x,y</u>) points.

       <b>-printgutter</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
                 This option specifies a distance by which righthand (recto) page images are moved to the right,
                 and lefthand (verso) page images are moved to the left, thus creating a  "gutter"  for  binding
                 when  the images are printed doublesided.  The <b>-printgutter</b> setting applies only when pages are
                 being printed 1-up.  It is ignored for any of the 2-up printing styles.

       <b>-printscale</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
                 Scale the output image by <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>.

       <b>-printside</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
                 Output only odd or only even pages; <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> must either be 1 or 2.

       <b>-reverse</b>  Output the pages in reverse order.

       <b>-SM</b> <u>&lt;directory&gt;</u>
                 Search the given directory  for  "standard  macro"  files  instead  of  searching  the  default
                 directory that was set up when PMW was built.

       <b>-s</b> <u>&lt;list&gt;</u> Output  only  the  specified  staves. These can be individual stave numbers, or pair of numbers
                 separated by a hyphen, to specify a range. Use commas to separate items in the list.

       <b>-t</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
                 Specify a transposition, in semitones.

       <b>-tumble</b>   When <b>-duplex</b> is set, <b>-tumble</b> causes the PostScript option for "tumbled" duplex printing.

       <b>-V</b> or <b>--version</b>
                 Output the PMW version number to stdout, then stop. No file is read.

       <b>-v</b>        Output verification information about the typesetting to stderr.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>RETURN</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>

       Error messages are written to  the  standard  error  stream.  The  return  code  is  the  C  return  code
       EXIT_SUCCESS  (usually  0)  for  success,  even if there were some warnings, and EXIT_FAILURE (usually 1)
       otherwise.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>

         pmw -format A5 -a5ona4 -pamphlet myscore
         pmw -s 3 -o quartet-viola.ps quartet.pmw
