</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       syslinux - install the SYSLINUX bootloader on a FAT filesystem

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>syslinux</b> [<b>OPTIONS</b>] <u>device</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Syslinux</b>  is  a  boot  loader  for  the  Linux  operating system which operates off an MS-DOS/Windows FAT
       filesystem. It is intended to simplify first-time installation of Linux, and for creation of  rescue  and
       other special-purpose boot disks.

       In order to create a bootable Linux floppy using <b>Syslinux</b>, prepare a normal MS-DOS formatted floppy. Copy
       one or more Linux kernel files to it, then execute the command:

              <b>syslinux</b> <b>--install</b> <b>/dev/fd0</b>

       This will alter the boot sector on the disk and copy a file named <u>ldlinux.sys</u> into its root directory.

       On  boot time, by default, the kernel will be loaded from the image named LINUX on the boot floppy.  This
       default can be changed, see the section on the <b>syslinux</b> configuration file.

       If the Shift or Alt keys are held down during boot, or the Caps or Scroll locks are  set,  <b>syslinux</b>  will
       display a <b><a href="../man8/lilo.8.html">lilo</a></b>(8) -style "boot:" prompt. The user can then type a kernel file name followed by any kernel
       parameters.  The  SYSLINUX bootloader does not need to know about the kernel file in advance; all that is
       required is that it is a file located in the root directory on the disk.

       <b>Syslinux</b> supports the loading of initial ramdisks (initrd) and the bzImage kernel format.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-i</b>, <b>--install</b>
              Install SYSLINUX on a new medium, overwriting any previously installed bootloader.

       <b>-U</b>, <b>--update</b>
              Install SYSLINUX on a new medium if and only if a version of SYSLINUX is already installed.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--stupid</b>
              Install a "safe, slow and stupid" version of SYSLINUX. This version may work on  some  very  buggy
              BIOSes  on  which  SYSLINUX would otherwise fail.  If you find a machine on which the -s option is
              required to make it boot reliably, please send as much info about your machine  as  you  can,  and
              include the failure mode.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--force</b>
              Force install even if it appears unsafe.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--raid</b>
              RAID mode.  If boot fails, tell the BIOS to boot the next device in the boot sequence (usually the
              next hard disk) instead of stopping with an error message.  This is useful for RAID-1 booting.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--directory</b> <u>subdirectory</u>
              Install the SYSLINUX control files in a subdirectory with the specified name (relative to the root
              directory on the device).

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--offset</b> <u>offset</u>
              Indicates that the filesystem is at an offset from the base of the device or file.

       <b>--once</b> <u>command</u>
              Declare a boot command to be tried on the first boot only.

       <b>-O</b>, <b>--clear-once</b>
              Clear the boot-once command.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--heads</b> <u>head-count</u>
              Override the detected number of heads for the geometry.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--sectors</b> <u>sector-count</u>
              Override the detected number of sectors for the geometry.

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--zipdrive</b>
              Assume zipdrive geometry (<u>--heads</u> <u>64</u> <u>--sectors</u> <u>32).</u>

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Configuration</b> <b>file</b>
       All  the  configurable  defaults  in SYSLINUX can be changed by putting a file called <b>syslinux.cfg</b> in the
       install directory of the boot disk. This is a text file in either UNIX or DOS format, containing  one  or
       more of the following items (case is insensitive for keywords).

       This list is out of date.

       In the configuration file blank lines and comment lines beginning with a hash mark (#) are ignored.

       <b>default</b> <u>kernel</u> [ <u>options</u> <u>...</u> ]
              Sets the default command line. If <b>syslinux</b> boots automatically, it will act just as if the entries
              after "default" had been typed in at the "boot:" prompt.

              If  no  DEFAULT  or UI statement is found, or the configuration file is missing entirely, SYSLINUX
              drops to the boot: prompt with an error message (if NOESCAPE is set, it stops with a "boot failed"
              message; this is also the case for PXELINUX if the configuration file is not found.)

       NOTE: Until SYSLINUX 3.85, if no configuration file is present, or no
              "default" entry is present in the configuration file, the default is "linux auto".

       Even earlier versions of SYSLINUX used to automatically
              append the string "auto" to whatever the user specified using the DEFAULT command.  As of  version
              1.54, this is no longer true, as it caused problems when using a shell as a substitute for "init."
              You may want to include this option manually.

       <b>append</b> <u>options</u> <u>...</u>
              Add  one or more <u>options</u> to the kernel command line. These are added both for automatic and manual
              boots. The options are added at the very beginning of the kernel command line, usually  permitting
              explicitly entered kernel options to override them. This is the equivalent of the <b><a href="../man8/lilo.8.html">lilo</a></b>(8)
               "append" option.

       <b>label</b> <u>label</u>
         <b>kernel</b> <u>image</u>
         <b>append</b> <u>options</u> <u>...</u>
              Indicates  that if <u>label</u> is entered as the kernel to boot, <b>syslinux</b> should instead boot <u>image</u>, and
              the specified "append" options should be used instead of the ones specified in the global  section
              of the file (before the first "label" command.) The default for <u>image</u> is the same as <u>label</u>, and if
              no  "append"  is  given the default is to use the global entry (if any).  Use "append -" to use no
              options at all.  Up to 128 "label" entries are permitted.

                     The "image" doesn't have to be a Linux kernel; it can be a boot sector (see below.)

       <b>implicit</b> <u>flag_val</u>
              If <u>flag_val</u> is 0, do not load a kernel image unless it has been  explicitly  named  in  a  "label"
              statement.  The default is 1.

       <b>timeout</b> <u>timeout</u>
              Indicates  how long to wait at the "boot:" prompt until booting automatically, in units of 1/10 s.
              The timeout is cancelled as soon as the user types anything on the keyboard, the assumption  being
              that  the  user  will  complete the command line already begun. A timeout of zero will disable the
              timeout completely, this is also the  default.  The  maximum  possible  timeout  value  is  35996;
              corresponding to just below one hour.

       <b>serial</b> <u>port</u> [ <u>baudrate</u> ]
              Enables  a serial port to act as the console. "port" is a number (0 = /dev/ttyS0 = COM1, etc.); if
              "baudrate" is omitted, the baud rate defaults to 9600 bps.  The serial parameters are hardcoded to
              be 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit.

              For this directive to be guaranteed to work properly, it should be  the  first  directive  in  the
              configuration file.

       <b>font</b> <u>filename</u>
              Load  a  font  in  .psf  format  before displaying any output (except the copyright line, which is
              output as ldlinux.sys itself is loaded.) <b>syslinux</b> only loads the font onto the video card; if  the
              .psf file contains a Unicode table it is ignored.  This only works on EGA and VGA cards; hopefully
              it should do nothing on others.

       <b>kbdmap</b> <u>keymap</u>
              Install a simple keyboard map. The keyboard remapper used is <u>very</u> simplistic (it simply remaps the
              keycodes  received  from  the  BIOS,  which  means  that only the key combinations relevant in the
              default layout - usually U.S.  English - can be mapped) but  should  at  least  help  people  with
              AZERTY  keyboard  layout  and the locations of = and , (two special characters used heavily on the
              Linux kernel command line.)

              The included program <b><a href="../man8/keytab-lilo.pl.8.html">keytab-lilo.pl</a></b>(8) from the <b><a href="../man8/lilo.8.html">lilo</a></b>(8)
               distribution can be used to create such keymaps.

       <b>display</b> <u>filename</u>
              Displays the indicated file on the screen at boot time (before the boot:  prompt,  if  displayed).
              Please  see  the  section  below  on  DISPLAY files. If the file is missing, this option is simply
              ignored.

       <b>prompt</b> <u>flag_val</u>
              If <u>flag_val</u> is 0, display the "boot:" prompt only if the Shift or Alt key is pressed, or Caps Lock
              or Scroll lock is set (this is the default).  If <u>flag_val</u> is 1, always display the "boot:" prompt.

       <b>f1</b> <u>filename</u>
       <b>f2</b> <u>filename</u>
       <u>...</u>
       <b>f9</b> <u>filename</u>
       <b>f10</b> <u>filename</u>
       <b>f11</b> <u>filename</u>
       <b>f12</b> <u>filename</u>
              Displays the indicated file on the screen when a function key is pressed at  the  "boot:"  prompt.
              This  can  be  used  to  implement  pre-boot  online  help (presumably for the kernel command line
              options.)

              When using the serial console, press <u>&lt;Ctrl-F&gt;&lt;digit&gt;</u> to get to the help screens, e.g. <u>&lt;Ctrl-F&gt;2</u> to
              get to the f2 screen.  For f10-f12, hit <u>&lt;Ctrl-F&gt;A</u>, <u>&lt;Ctrl-F&gt;B</u>, <u>&lt;Ctrl-F&gt;C</u>.   For  compatiblity  with
              earlier versions, f10 can also be entered as <u>&lt;Ctrl-F&gt;0</u>.

   <b>Display</b> <b>file</b> <b>format</b>
       DISPLAY  and  function-key help files are text files in either DOS or UNIX format (with or without <u>&lt;CR&gt;</u>).
       In addition, the following special codes are interpreted:

       <u>&lt;FF&gt;</u> = <u>&lt;Ctrl-L&gt;</u> = ASCII 12
              Clear the screen, home the cursor.  Note that the screen is filled with the current display color.

       <u>&lt;SI&gt;&lt;bg&gt;&lt;fg&gt;</u>, <u>&lt;SI&gt;</u> = <u>&lt;Ctrl-O&gt;</u> = ASCII 15
              Set the display colors to the specified background and foreground colors, where <u>&lt;bg&gt;</u> and <u>&lt;fg&gt;</u>  are
              hex digits, corresponding to the standard PC display attributes:

              0 = black          8 = dark grey
              1 = dark blue      9 = bright blue
              2 = dark green     a = bright green
              3 = dark cyan      b = bright cyan
              4 = dark red       c = bright red
              5 = dark purple    d = bright purple
              6 = brown          e = yellow
              7 = light grey     f = white

              Picking  a  bright  color  (8-f) for the background results in the corresponding dark color (0-7),
              with the foreground flashing.

              colors are not visible over the serial console.

       <u>&lt;CAN&gt;</u>filename<u>&lt;newline&gt;</u>, <u>&lt;CAN&gt;</u> = <u>&lt;Ctrl-X&gt;</u> = ASCII 24
              If a VGA display is present, enter graphics mode and display the graphic included in the specified
              file.  The file format is an ad hoc format called LSS16; the included  Perl  program  "ppmtolss16"
              can  be  used  to  produce  these  images.   This  Perl  program  also  includes  the  file format
              specification.

              The image is displayed in 640x480 16-color mode.  Once in graphics mode,  the  display  attributes
              (set  by  <u>&lt;SI&gt;</u> code sequences) work slightly differently: the background color is ignored, and the
              foreground colors are the 16 colors specified in the image  file.   For  that  reason,  ppmtolss16
              allows you to specify that certain colors should be assigned to specific color indicies.

              Color  indicies 0 and 7, in particular, should be chosen with care: 0 is the background color, and
              7 is the color used for the text printed by SYSLINUX itself.

       <u>&lt;EM&gt;</u>, <u>&lt;EM&gt;</u> = <u>&lt;Ctrl-U&gt;</u> = ASCII 25
              If we are currently in graphics mode, return to text mode.

       <u>&lt;DLE&gt;</u>..<u>&lt;ETB&gt;</u><b>,</b> <u>&lt;Ctrl-P&gt;</u><b>..</b><u>&lt;Ctrl-W&gt;</u> <b>=</b> <b>ASCII</b> <b>16-23</b>
              These codes can be used to select which modes to print a certain part  of  the  message  file  in.
              Each  of  these  control  characters select a specific set of modes (text screen, graphics screen,
              serial port) for which the output is actually displayed:

              Character                       Text    Graph   Serial
              ------------------------------------------------------
              &lt;DLE&gt; = &lt;Ctrl-P&gt; = ASCII 16     No      No      No
              &lt;DC1&gt; = &lt;Ctrl-Q&gt; = ASCII 17     Yes     No      No
              &lt;DC2&gt; = &lt;Ctrl-R&gt; = ASCII 18     No      Yes     No
              &lt;DC3&gt; = &lt;Ctrl-S&gt; = ASCII 19     Yes     Yes     No
              &lt;DC4&gt; = &lt;Ctrl-T&gt; = ASCII 20     No      No      Yes
              &lt;NAK&gt; = &lt;Ctrl-U&gt; = ASCII 21     Yes     No      Yes
              &lt;SYN&gt; = &lt;Ctrl-V&gt; = ASCII 22     No      Yes     Yes
              &lt;ETB&gt; = &lt;Ctrl-W&gt; = ASCII 23     Yes     Yes     Yes

              For example:
              &lt;DC1&gt;Text mode&lt;DC2&gt;Graphics mode&lt;DC4&gt;Serial port&lt;ETB&gt;
               ... will actually print out which mode the console is in!

       <u>&lt;SUB&gt;</u> = <u>&lt;Ctrl-Z&gt;</u> = ASCII 26
              End of file (DOS convention).

   <b>Other</b> <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b>
       This version of <b>syslinux</b> supports chain loading of other  operating  systems  (such  as  MS-DOS  and  its
       derivatives, including Windows 95/98).

       Chain loading requires the boot sector of the foreign operating system to be stored in a file in the root
       directory  of  the filesystem.  Because neither Linux kernels, nor boot sector images have reliable magic
       numbers, <b>syslinux</b> will look at the file extension. The following extensions are recognised:

       none or other    Linux kernel image
       BSS              Boot sector (DOS superblock will be patched in)
       BS               Boot sector

       For filenames given on the command line, <b>syslinux</b> will search for the file by adding  extensions  in  the
       order  listed  above  if  the  plain  filename is not found. Filenames in KERNEL statements must be fully
       qualified.

   <b>Novice</b> <b>protection</b>
       <b>Syslinux</b> will attempt to detect if the user is trying to boot on a 286  or  lower  class  machine,  or  a
       machine with less than 608K of low ("DOS") RAM (which means the Linux boot sequence cannot complete).  If
       so,  a  message  is  displayed  and  the  boot sequence aborted.  Holding down the Ctrl key while booting
       disables this feature.

       The compile time and date of a specific <b>syslinux</b> version  can  be  obtained  by  the  DOS  command  "type
       ldlinux.sys".  This  is  also  used  as the signature for the LDLINUX.SYS file, which must match the boot
       sector

       Any file that <b>syslinux</b> uses can be marked hidden, system  or  readonly  if  so  is  convenient;  <b>syslinux</b>
       ignores  all  file  attributes.   The  SYSLINUX  installed  automatically  sets the readonly attribute on
       LDLINUX.SYS.

   <b>Bootable</b> <b>CD-ROMs</b>
       SYSLINUX can be used to create bootdisk images for El Torito-compatible  bootable  CD-ROMs.  However,  it
       appears  that  many BIOSes are very buggy when it comes to booting CD-ROMs. Some users have reported that
       the following steps are helpful in making a CD-ROM that is bootable on the  largest  possible  number  of
       machines:

       •      Use the -s (safe, slow and stupid) option to SYSLINUX

       •      Put the boot image as close to the beginning of the ISO 9660 filesystem as possible.

       A CD-ROM is so much faster than a floppy that the -s option shouldn't matter from a speed perspective.

       Of course, you probably want to use ISOLINUX instead.  See the documentation file <b>isolinux.doc</b>.

   <b>Booting</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>FAT</b> <b>partition</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b>
       SYSLINUX  can  boot  from  a  FAT filesystem partition on a hard disk (including FAT32). The installation
       procedure is identical to the procedure for installing it on a floppy, and should work under  either  DOS
       or  Linux.  To  boot from a partition, SYSLINUX needs to be launched from a Master Boot Record or another
       boot loader, just like DOS itself would. A sample master boot sector (<b>mbr.bin</b>) is included with SYSLINUX.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       I would appreciate hearing of any problems you have with SYSLINUX.  I would also like to hear from you if
       you have successfully used SYSLINUX, especially if you are using it for a distribution.

       If you are reporting problems, please include all possible information about your system and  your  BIOS;
       the  vast  majority  of  all  problems  reported turn out to be BIOS or hardware bugs, and I need as much
       information as possible in order to diagnose the problems.

       There is a mailing list for discussion among SYSLINUX  users  and  for  announcements  of  new  and  test
       versions. To join, send a message to <a href="mailto:majordomo@linux.kernel.org">majordomo@linux.kernel.org</a> with the line:
