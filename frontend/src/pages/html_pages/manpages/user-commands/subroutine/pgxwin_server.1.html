       pgxwin_server - X-window sever for pgplot plotting subroutine library

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  documents  briefly  the  <b>pgxwin_server</b> command.  This manual page was written for the
       Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       <b>pgplot</b> is a large collection of plotting routines callable from C, as well as  FORTRAN  (also  perl,  see
       below).   Many  drivers  are  included  to  render the plots on devices.  To use PGPLOT, you must set the
       environment variable, PGPLOT_DIR to "/usr/lib/pgplot".   That is ,  under  csh,  type  setenv  PGPLOT_DIR
       /usr/lib/pgplot .  Under bash, type PGPLOT_DIR="/usr/lib/pgplot";export PGPLOT_DIR;

       The default device to be used for the plots can be specified by the PGPLOT_DEV environment variable.

       <b>pgxwin_server</b>  is  the  server program for the /xwindow and /xserve devices for pgplot.  <b>pgxwin_server</b> is
       automatically started by the /xw and /xs driver when first called upon. pgxwin_server then  continues  to
       serve  windows  to  subsequent  PGPLOT  programs  and  remains  running indefinitely. In order that it be
       possible to kill the server, an icon window for it is displayed. Window  managers generally provide a way
       to interactively kill windows, and if this is applied to the server window, then the  server  will  close
       any  inactive  /xserve  windows,  and  if  no active /xw or /xs windows remain, then the server will shut
       itself down cleanly. Note that inactive windows are distinguishable from active windows by the appearance
       of a  skull-and-crossbones cursor.

       If your default display is correctly set then simply typing:

       pgxwin_server

       with no arguments should start the server, and the server icon  should  appear  on  the  display.  If  an
       alternate display is desired then the default display can be overridden with the -display argument. Other
       options to override selected X resources from the command-line are also available. To see them type:

       pgxwin_server -help

       Documentation  on the library can be found in the directory, <b>/usr/share/doc/pgplot</b> <b>.</b>  There exists a perl
       interface to pgplot, pgperl, also available for Debian.  Extensive documentation can be found at
