</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gphotofs - filesystem to mount digital cameras

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       GPhotoFS is a filesystem client based on libgphoto2 that exposes supported cameras as filesystems; while
       some cameras implement the USB Mass Storage class and already appear as filesystems (making this program
       redundant), many use the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) or some other custom protocol. But as long as
       the camera is supported by libgphoto2, it can be mounted as a filesystem using this program.

       As libgphoto2 is a userspace library for interacting with cameras, it is natural that if one to build a
       filesystem ontop of it, one should use FUSE, and that is what I have done.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       mounting
           gphotofs &lt;mountpoint&gt;

       unmounting
           fusermount -u &lt;mountpoint&gt;

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       You  must have permission to read and write the device.  By default, devices recognized by libgphoto2 are
       created with read/write access for group "plugdev", so users must be added to this group to use GPhotoFS.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       GPhotoFS currently can't add or remove directories, rename files or directories, add or modify files  and
       get space information.
