</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       9mount, 9bind, 9umount - mount/unmount 9p filesystems

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>9mount</b> [ insuvx ] [ -a SPEC ] [ -c CACHE ] [ -d DEBUG ] [ -m MSIZE ] DIAL MOUNTPT

       <b>9bind</b> OLD NEW

       <b>9umount</b> MOUNTPT

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>9mount</b>  mounts a 9p filesystem served at DIAL on MOUNTPT. MOUNTPT must be writable by you and not sticky.
       DIAL is a dial string assuming one of the forms:

       unix!SOCKET
       tcp!HOST[!PORT]
       virtio!CHANNEL
       -

       where SOCKET is the name of a file representing a socket, HOST is a hostname, PORT is a  port  number  or
       service  name,  and  CHANNEL  is  a virtio channel name (currently ignored). - indicates that 9p messages
       should be read/written on stdin/stdout.  <b>9mount</b> has several options:

       -i     mount the file system with your uid/gid

       -n     dry-run, print mount command to stderr but don't actually mount anything

       -s     single attach mode - all users accessing the mount point  see  the  same  filesystem  (by  default
              they'll each see a unique attach)

       -u     use the 9P2000.u extensions

       -v     use device mapping

       -x     exclusive access - other users cannot access the mount point

       -a SPEC
              SPEC determines which file tree to mount when attaching to file servers that export multiple trees

       -c CACHE
              turns  on  caching  using  CACHE mode. Supported modes are <u>loose</u> (suitable for exclusive read-only
              mounts), <u>fscache</u>, and <u>mmap</u>.

       -d DEBUG
              comma seperated list of channels for which to enable debug output. Possible channels include: err,
              devel, 9p, vfs, conv, mux, trans, alloc, fcall.

       -m MSIZE
              specifies the maximum length of a single 9p message in bytes. Must be less than or equal  to  8192
              for non-root users.

       <b>9bind</b> performs a bind mount, making the tree visible at directory OLD also visible at mount point NEW.

       <b>9umount</b> unmounts a 9p filesystem previously mounted by you.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       $USER  the uname to provide to the server.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       9mount -i 'unix!/tmp/ns.'$USER'.:0/factotum' $HOME/n/factotum
              mount p9p's factotum interface

       9mount 'tcp!sources.cs.bell-labs.com' $HOME/n/sources
              import plan 9's "sources"

       9mount -u -a/home/sqweek/mail 'tcp!wren!5640' $HOME/mail
              import my maildir from my server(wren), being served by ufs

       9mount -i 'tcp!wren' $HOME/n/wren; 9bind $HOME/n/wren/home/sqweek/mail $HOME/mail
              again importing my maildir, this time serving via u9fs

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>9mount</b> truncates user names and SPECs to 249 characters.  <b>9umount</b> doesn't know this, so you won't be able
       to  unmount  anything outside your home directory. But you probably never bother logging out if your user
       name is that long.

       <b>9mount</b> doesn't update /etc/mtab.

       <b>9bind</b> only does a "shallow", non-recursive bind - any mounted filesystems under the  OLD  tree  will  not
       appear mounted in the NEW tree.

       If you <b>9bind</b> a non-9p filesystem outside your home directory, <b>9umount</b> won't let you unmount it.
