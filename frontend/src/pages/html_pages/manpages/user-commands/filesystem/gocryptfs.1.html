</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       gocryptfs is an encrypted overlay filesystem written in Go.  Encrypted files are stored in CIPHERDIR, and
       a plain-text view can be presented by mounting the filesystem at MOUNTPOINT.

       gocryptfs  was  inspired  by <a href="../man1/encfs.1.html">encfs</a>(1) and strives to fix its security issues while providing good perfor‐
       mance.

</pre><h4><b>ACTION</b> <b>FLAGS</b></h4><pre>
       Unless one of the following <u>action</u> <u>flags</u> is passed, the default action is to mount a filesystem (see SYN‐
       OPSIS).

   <b>-fsck</b>
       Check CIPHERDIR for consistency.  If corruption is found, the exit code is 26.

   <b>-h,</b> <b>-help</b>
       Print a short help text that shows the more-often used options.

   <b>-hh</b>
       Long help text, shows all available options.

   <b>-info</b>
       Pretty-print the contents of the config file in CIPHERDIR for human consumption, stripping out  sensitive
       data.

       Example:

              $ gocryptfs -info my_cipherdir
              Creator:      gocryptfs v2.0-beta2
              FeatureFlags: GCMIV128 HKDF DirIV EMENames LongNames Raw64
              EncryptedKey: 64B
              ScryptObject: Salt=32B N=65536 R=8 P=1 KeyLen=32

   <b>-init</b>
       Initialize encrypted directory.

   <b>-passwd</b>
       Change the password.  Will ask for the old password, check if it is correct, and ask for a new one.

       This  can be used together with <b>-masterkey</b> if you forgot the password but know the master key.  Note that
       without the old password, gocryptfs cannot tell if the master key is correct and will overwrite  the  old
       one  without mercy.  It will, however, create a backup copy of the old config file as <b>gocryptfs.conf.bak</b>.
       Delete it after you have verified that you can access your files with the new password.

   <b>-speed</b>
       Run crypto speed test.  Benchmark Go’s built-in GCM against OpenSSL (if  available).   The  library  that
       will be selected on “-openssl=auto” (the default) is marked as such.

   <b>-version</b>
       Print  version  and  exit.   The  output  contains  three  fields  separated by “;”.  Example: “gocryptfs
       v1.1.1-5-g75b776c; go-fuse 6b801d3; 2016-11-01 go1.7.3”.  Field 1 is the gocryptfs version,  field  2  is
       the version of the go-fuse library, field 3 is the compile date and the Go version that was used.

</pre><h4><b>INIT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Available options for <b>-init</b> are listed below.  Usually, you don’t need any.  Defaults are fine.

   <b>-aessiv</b>
       Use  the AES-SIV encryption mode.  This is slower than AES-GCM but is secure with deterministic nonces as
       used in “-reverse” mode.

       Run <b>gocryptfs</b> <b>-speed</b> to find out if and how much slower.

   <b>-deterministic-names</b>
       Disable file name randomisation and creation of <b>gocryptfs.diriv</b> files.  This can prevent  sync  conflicts
       conflicts  when  synchronising files, but leaks information about identical file names across directories
       (“Identical names leak” in https://nuetzlich.net/gocryptfs/comparison/#file-names ).

       The resulting <b>gocryptfs.conf</b> has “DirIV” missing from “FeatureFlags”.

   <b>-devrandom</b>
       Obsolete and ignored on gocryptfs v2.2 and later.

       See       https://github.com/rfjakob/gocryptfs/commit/f3c777d5eaa682d878c638192311e52f9c204294        and
       https://github.com/rfjakob/gocryptfs/issues/596 for background info.

   <b>-hkdf</b>
       Use HKDF to derive separate keys for content and name encryption from the master key.  Default true.

   <b>-longnamemax</b>
              integer value, allowed range 62...255

       Hash  file  names that (in encrypted form) exceed this length.  The default is 255, which aligns with the
       usual name length limit on Linux and provides best performance.

       However, online storage may impose lower limits on file name and/or path length.  In this  case,  setting
       -longnamemax to a lower value can be helpful.

       The lower the value, the more extra <b>.name</b> files must be created, which slows down directory listings.

       Values below 62 are not allowed as then the hashed name would be longer than the original name.

       Example:

              -longnamemax 100

   <b>-plaintextnames</b>
       Do not encrypt file names and symlink targets.

   <b>-raw64</b>
       Use unpadded base64 encoding for file names.  This gets rid of the trailing “\=\=”.  A filesystem created
       with this option can only be mounted using gocryptfs v1.2 and higher.  Default true.

   <b>-reverse</b>
       Reverse mode shows a read-only encrypted view of a plaintext directory.  Implies “-aessiv”.

   <b>-xchacha</b>
       Use  XChaCha20-Poly1305  file  content  encryption.  This should be much faster than AES-GCM on CPUs that
       lack AES acceleration.

       Run <b>gocryptfs</b> <b>-speed</b> to find out if and how much faster.

</pre><h4><b>MOUNT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Available options for mounting are listed below.  Usually, you don’t need any.  Defaults are fine.

   <b>-acl</b>
       Enable ACL enforcement.  When you want to use ACLs, you must enable this option.

   <b>-allow_other</b>
       By default, the Linux kernel prevents any other user (even root) to access  a  mounted  FUSE  filesystem.
       Settings  this  option allows access for other users, subject to file permission checking.  Only works if
       user_allow_other is set in /etc/fuse.conf.  This option is equivalent to “allow_other” plus “default_per‐
       missions” described in <a href="../man8/fuse.8.html">fuse</a>(8).

   <b>-badname</b> <b>string</b>
       When gocryptfs encounters a “bad” file name (cannot be decrypted or decrypts to garbage),  a  warning  is
       logged and the file is hidden from the plaintext view.

       With  the  <b>-badname</b>  option,  you can select “bad” file names that should still be shown in the plaintext
       view instead of hiding them.  Bad files will get <b>GOCRYPTFS_BAD_NAME</b> appended to their name.

       Glob pattern.  Can be passed multiple times for multiple patterns.

       Examples:

       Dropbox sync conflicts:

              -badname '*conflicted copy*'

       Syncthing sync conflicts:

              -badname '*.sync-conflict*'

       Show all invalid filenames:

              -badname '*'

   <b>-ctlsock</b> <b>string</b>
       Create a control socket at the specified location.  The socket can be used to decrypt and  encrypt  paths
       inside  the  filesystem.  When using this option, make sure that the directory you place the socket in is
       not world-accessible.  For example, <b>/run/user/UID/my.socket</b> would be suitable.

   <b>-dev,</b> <b>-nodev</b>
       Enable (<b>-dev</b>) or disable (<b>-nodev</b>) device files in a gocryptfs mount (default: <b>-nodev</b>).  If both are spec‐
       ified, <b>-nodev</b> takes precedence.  You need root permissions to use <b>-dev</b>.

   <b>-e</b> <b>PATH,</b> <b>-exclude</b> <b>PATH</b>
       Only for reverse mode: exclude relative plaintext path from the encrypted view, matching only  from  root
       of mounted filesystem.  Can be passed multiple times.

       Example that excludes the directories “Music” and “Movies” from the root directory:

              gocryptfs -reverse -exclude Music -exclude Movies /home/user /mnt/user.encrypted

       See also <b>-exclude-wildcard</b>, <b>-exclude-from</b> and the EXCLUDING FILES section.

   <b>-ew</b> <b>GITIGNORE-PATTERN,</b> <b>-exclude-wildcard</b> <b>GITIGNORE-PATTERN</b>
       Only for reverse mode: exclude paths from the encrypted view in <a href="../man5/gitignore.5.html">gitignore</a>(5) syntax, wildcards supported.
       Pass multiple times for multiple patterns.

       Example to exclude all <b>.mp3</b> files in any directory:

              gocryptfs -reverse -exclude-wildcard '*.mp3' /home/user /mnt/user.encrypted

       Example to to exclude everything but the directory `important' in the root dir:

              gocryptfs -reverse -exclude-wildcard '*' -exclude-wildcard '!/important' /home/user /mnt/user.encrypted

       See also <b>-exclude-from</b> and the EXCLUDING FILES section.

   <b>-exclude-from</b> <b>FILE</b>
       Only for reverse mode: reads gitignore patterns from a file.  Can be passed multiple times.  Example:

              gocryptfs -reverse -exclude-from <a href="file:~/crypt-exclusions">~/crypt-exclusions</a> /home/user /mnt/user.encrypted

       See also <b>-exclude</b>, <b>-exclude-wildcard</b> and the EXCLUDING FILES section.

   <b>-exec,</b> <b>-noexec</b>
       Enable (<b>-exec</b>) or disable (<b>-noexec</b>) executables in a gocryptfs mount (default: <b>-exec</b>).  If both are spec‐
       ified, <b>-noexec</b> takes precedence.

   <b>-fg,</b> <b>-f</b>
       Stay  in  the foreground instead of forking away.  For compatibility, “-f” is also accepted, but “-fg” is
       preferred.

       Unless <b>-notifypid</b> is also passed, the logs go to stdout and stderr instead of syslog.

   <b>-force_owner</b> <b>string</b>
       If given a string of the form “uid:gid” (where both “uid” and “gid” are substituted with  positive  inte‐
       gers),  presents  all files as owned by the given uid and gid, regardless of their actual ownership.  Im‐
       plies “allow_other”.

       This is rarely desired behavior: One should <u>usually</u> run gocryptfs as the account which owns the  backing-
       store  files,  which should <u>usually</u> be one and the same with the account intended to access the decrypted
       content.  An example of a case where this may be useful is a situation  where  content  is  stored  on  a
       filesystem that doesn’t properly support UNIX ownership and permissions.

   <b>-forcedecode</b>
       Obsolete and ignored on gocryptfs v2.2 and later.

       See  https://github.com/rfjakob/gocryptfs/commit/d023cd6c95fcbc6b5056ba1f425d2ac3df4abc5a for what it was
       and why it was dropped.

   <b>-fsname</b> <b>string</b>
       Override the filesystem name (first column in df -T).  Can also be passed as “-o fsname=” and is  equiva‐
       lent to libfuse’s option of the same name.  By default, CIPHERDIR is used.

   <b>-fusedebug</b>
       Enable fuse library debug output.

   <b>-i</b> <b>duration,</b> <b>-idle</b> <b>duration</b>
       Only  for  forward mode: automatically unmount the filesystem if it has been idle for the specified dura‐
       tion.  Durations can be specified like “500s” or “2h45m”.  0 (the default) means stay mounted indefinite‐
       ly.

       When a process has open files or its working directory in the mount, this will keep it not  idle  indefi‐
       nitely.

   <b>-kernel_cache</b>
       Enable the kernel_cache option of the FUSE filesystem, see <a href="../man8/fuse.8.html">fuse</a>(8) for details.

   <b>-ko</b>
       Pass  additional  mount  options to the kernel (comma-separated list).  FUSE filesystems are mounted with
       “nodev,nosuid” by default.  If gocryptfs runs as root, you can enable device files by passing  the  oppo‐
       site  mount  option,  “dev”,  and  if you want to enable suid-binaries, pass “suid”.  “ro” (equivalent to
       passing the “-ro” option) and “noexec” may also be interesting.  For a  complete  list  see  the  section
       <b>FILESYSTEM-INDEPENDENT</b>  <b>MOUNT</b>  <b>OPTIONS</b>  in <a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a>(8).  On MacOS, “local” enables volume-based trash if you
       have <b>.Trashes</b> folder in the root of your volume (might need to be manually created)  note,  though,  that
       “local” is marked as “experimental” in osxfuse (https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/wiki/Mount-options#lo‐
       cal); “noapplexattr”, “noappledouble” may also be interesting.

       Note that unlike “-o”, “-ko” is a regular option and must be passed BEFORE the directories.  Example:

              gocryptfs -ko noexec /tmp/foo /tmp/bar

   <b>-longnames</b>
       Store names that are longer than 175 bytes in extra files (default true).

       This  flag is only useful when recovering very old gocryptfs filesystems (gocryptfs v0.8 and earlier) us‐
       ing “-masterkey”.  It is ignored (stays at the default) otherwise.

   <b>-nodev</b>
       See <b>-dev,</b> <b>-nodev</b>.

   <b>-noexec</b>
       See <b>-exec,</b> <b>-noexec</b>.

   <b>-nofail</b>
       Having the <b>nofail</b> option in <b><a href="file:/etc/fstab">/etc/fstab</a></b> instructs <b>systemd</b> to continue booting normally even if  the  mount
       fails (see <b>man</b> <b>systemd.fstab</b>).

       The option is ignored by <b>gocryptfs</b> itself and has no effect outside <b><a href="file:/etc/fstab">/etc/fstab</a></b>.

   <b>-nonempty</b>
       Allow  mounting over non-empty directories.  FUSE by default disallows this to prevent accidental shadow‐
       ing of files.

   <b>-noprealloc</b>
       Disable preallocation before writing.  By default, gocryptfs preallocates the space the next  write  will
       take  using  <a href="../man2/fallocate.2.html">fallocate</a>(2) in mode FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE.  The preallocation makes sure it cannot run out of
       space in the middle of the write, which would cause the last 4kB block to be corrupt and unreadable.

       On ext4, preallocation is fast and does not cause a noticeable performance hit.  Unfortunately, on Btrfs,
       preallocation is very slow, especially on rotational HDDs.  The  “-noprealloc”  option  gives  users  the
       choice to trade robustness against out-of-space errors for a massive speedup.

       For benchmarks and more details of the issue see https://github.com/rfjakob/gocryptfs/issues/63 .

   <b>-nosuid</b>
       See <b>-suid,</b> <b>-nosuid</b>.

   <b>-nosyslog</b>
       Diagnostic  messages  are  normally redirected to syslog once gocryptfs daemonizes.  This option disables
       the redirection and messages will continue be printed to stdout and stderr.

   <b>-notifypid</b> <b>int</b>
       Send USR1 to the specified process after successful mount.  This is used internally for daemonization.

   <b>-one-file-system</b>
       Don’t cross filesystem boundaries (like rsync’s <b>--one-file-system</b>).  Mountpoints will appear as empty di‐
       rectories.

       Only applicable to reverse mode.

       Limitation: Mounted single files (yes this is possible) are NOT hidden.

   <b>-rw,</b> <b>-ro</b>
       Mount the filesystem read-write (<b>-rw</b>, default) or read-only (<b>-ro</b>).  If  both  are  specified,  <b>-ro</b>  takes
       precedence.

   <b>-reverse</b>
       See  the  <b>-reverse</b>  section  in INIT FLAGS.  You need to specify the <b>-reverse</b> option both at <b>-init</b> and at
       mount.

   <b>-serialize_reads</b>
       The kernel usually submits multiple concurrent reads to service userspace requests and kernel  readahead.
       gocryptfs  serves  them concurrently and in arbitrary order.  On backing storage that performs poorly for
       concurrent or out-of-order reads (like Amazon Cloud Drive),  this  behavior  can  cause  very  slow  read
       speeds.

       The  <b>-serialize_reads</b> option does two things: (1) reads will be submitted one-by-one (no concurrency) and
       (2) gocryptfs tries to order the reads by file offset order.

       The ordering requires gocryptfs to wait a certain time before submitting a read.  The  serialization  in‐
       troduces extra locking.  These factors will limit throughput to below 70MB/s.

       For more details visit https://github.com/rfjakob/gocryptfs/issues/92 .

   <b>-sharedstorage</b>
       Enable work-arounds so gocryptfs works better when the backing storage directory is concurrently accessed
       by multiple gocryptfs instances.

       At the moment, it does two things:

       1. Disable stat() caching so changes to the backing storage show up immediately.

       2. Disable  hard link tracking, as the inode numbers on the backing storage are not stable when files are
          deleted and re-created behind our back.  This would otherwise produce strange “file  does  not  exist”
          and other errors.

       When “-sharedstorage” is active, performance is reduced and hard links cannot be created.

       Even  with  this flag set, you may hit occasional problems.  Running gocryptfs on shared storage does not
       receive as much testing as the usual (exclusive) use-case.  Please test your workload in advance and  re‐
       port any problems you may hit.

       More info: https://github.com/rfjakob/gocryptfs/issues/156

   <b>-suid,</b> <b>-nosuid</b>
       Enable  (<b>-suid</b>)  or  disable (<b>-nosuid</b>) suid and sgid executables in a gocryptfs mount (default: <b>-nosuid</b>).
       If both are specified, <b>-nosuid</b> takes precedence.  You need root permissions to use <b>-suid</b>.

   <b>-zerokey</b>
       Use all-zero dummy master key.  This options is only intended for automated testing as it does  not  pro‐
       vide any security.

</pre><h4><b>COMMON</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options  that apply to more than one action are listed below.  Each options lists where it is applicable.
       Again, usually you don’t need any.

   <b>-config</b> <b>string</b>
       Use specified config file instead of <b>CIPHERDIR/gocryptfs.conf</b>.

       Applies to: all actions that use a config file: mount, <b>-fsck</b>, <b>-passwd</b>, <b>-info</b>, <b>-init</b>.

   <b>-cpuprofile</b> <b>string</b>
       Write cpu profile to specified file.

       Applies to: all actions.

   <b>-d,</b> <b>-debug</b>
       Enable debug output.

       Applies to: all actions.

   <b>-extpass</b> <b>CMD</b> <b>[-extpass</b> <b>ARG1</b> <b>...]</b>
       Use an external program (like ssh-askpass) for the password prompt.  The program should return the  pass‐
       word  on  stdout,  a trailing newline is stripped by gocryptfs.  If you just want to read from a password
       file, see <b>-passfile</b>.

       When <b>-extpass</b> is specified once, the string argument will be split  on  spaces.   For  example,  <b>-extpass</b>
       <b>"md5sum</b> <b>my</b> <b>password.txt"</b> will be executed as <b>"md5sum"</b> <b>"my"</b> <b>"password.txt"</b>, which is NOT what you want.

       Specify  <b>-extpass</b>  twice  or  more  to  use the string arguments as-is.  For example, you DO want to call
       <b>md5sum</b> like this: <b>-extpass</b> <b>"md5sum"</b> <b>-extpass</b> <b>"my</b> <b>password.txt"</b>.

       If you want to prevent splitting on spaces but don’t want to pass arguments to your  program,  use  <b>"--"</b>,
       which is accepted by most programs: <b>-extpass</b> <b>"my</b> <b>program"</b> <b>-extpass</b> <b>"--"</b>

       Applies to: all actions that ask for a password.

       BUG:  In  <b>-extpass</b>  <b>-X</b>,  the <b>-X</b> will be interpreted as <b>--X</b>.  Please use <b>-extpass=-X</b> to prevent that.  See
       <b>Dash</b> <b>duplication</b> in the <b>BUGS</b> section for details.

   <b>-fido2</b> <b>DEVICE_PATH</b>
       Use a FIDO2 token to initialize and unlock the filesystem.  Use “fido2-token -L” to obtain the FIDO2  to‐
       ken device path.  For linux, “fido2-tools” package is needed.

       Applies to: all actions that ask for a password.

   <b>-masterkey</b> <b>string</b>
       Use  an  explicit master key specified on the command line or, if the special value “stdin” is used, read
       the masterkey from stdin, instead of reading the config file and asking for the decryption password.

       Note that the command line, and with it the master key, is visible to anybody on the machine who can exe‐
       cute “ps -auxwww”.  Use “-masterkey=stdin” to avoid that risk.

       The masterkey option is meant as a recovery option for emergencies, such as if  you  have  forgotten  the
       password or lost the config file.

       Even  if  a  config file exists, it will not be used.  All non-standard settings have to be passed on the
       command line: <b>-aessiv</b> when you mount a filesystem that was created using reverse mode, or <b>-plaintextnames</b>
       for a filesystem that was created with that option.

       Examples:

              -masterkey=6f717d8b-6b5f8e8a-fd0aa206-778ec093-62c5669b-abd229cd-241e00cd-b4d6713d
              -masterkey=stdin

       Applies to: all actions that ask for a password.

   <b>-memprofile</b> <b>string</b>
       Write memory profile to the specified file.  This is useful when debugging memory usage of gocryptfs.

       Applies to: all actions.

   <b>-o</b> <b>COMMA-SEPARATED-OPTIONS</b>
       For compatibility with <a href="../man1/mount.1.html">mount</a>(1), options are also accepted as “-o COMMA-SEPARATED-OPTIONS” at the end  of
       the command line.  For example, “-o q,zerokey” is equivalent to passing “-q -zerokey”.

       Note  that you can only use options that are understood by gocryptfs with “-o”.  If you want to pass spe‐
       cial flags to the kernel, you should use “-ko” (<u>k</u>ernel  <u>o</u>ption).   This  is  different  in  libfuse-based
       filesystems, that automatically pass any “-o” options they do not understand along to the kernel.

       Example:

              gocryptfs /tmp/foo /tmp/bar -o q,zerokey

       Applies to: all actions.

   <b>-openssl</b> <b>bool/“auto”</b>
       Use  OpenSSL  instead  of built-in Go crypto (default “auto”).  Using built-in crypto is 4x slower unless
       your CPU has AES instructions and you are using Go 1.6+.  In mode “auto”, gocrypts chooses the faster op‐
       tion.

       Applies to: all actions.

   <b>-passfile</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>[-passfile</b> <b>FILE2</b> <b>...]</b>
       Read password from the specified plain text file.  The file should contain exactly one line (do  not  use
       binary  files!).   A warning will be printed if there is more than one line, and only the first line will
       be used.  A single trailing newline is allowed and does not cause a warning.

       Pass this option multiple times to read the first line from multiple files.  They  are  concatenated  for
       the effective password.

       Example:

              echo hello &gt; hello.txt
              echo word &gt; world.txt
              gocryptfs -passfile hello.txt -passfile world.txt

       The effective password will be “helloworld”.

       Applies to: all actions that ask for a password.

   <b>-q,</b> <b>-quiet</b>
       Quiet - silence informational messages.

       Applies to: all actions.

   <b>-scryptn</b> <b>int</b>
       gocryptfs uses <u>scrypt</u> for hashing the password when mounting, which protects from brute-force attacks.

       <b>-scryptn</b>  controls  the  <u>scrypt</u>  cost  parameter  “N”  expressed as scryptn=log2(N).  Possible values are
       <b>-scryptn=10</b> to <b>-scryptn=28</b>, representing N=2^10 to N=2^28.

       Setting this to a lower value speeds up mounting and reduces its memory needs,  but  makes  the  password
       susceptible to brute-force attacks.  The default is 16.

       The memory usage for <u>scrypt</u> during mounting is as follows:

</pre><h4><b>EXCLUDING</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       In  reverse  mode, it is possible to exclude files from the encrypted view, using the <b>-exclude</b>, <b>-exclude-</b>
       <b>wildcard</b> and <b>-exclude-from</b> options.

       <b>-exclude</b> matches complete paths, so <b>-exclude</b> <b>file.txt</b> only excludes a file named <b>file.txt</b> in the root  of
       the mounted filesystem; files named <b>file.txt</b> in subdirectories are still visible.  Wildcards are NOT sup‐
       ported.   This  option is kept for compatibility with the behavior up to version 1.6.x.  New users should
       use <b>-exclude-wildcard</b> instead.

       <b>-exclude-wildcard</b> uses gitignore syntax and matches files anywhere,  so  <b>-exclude-wildcard</b>  <b>file.txt</b>  ex‐
       cludes  files  named  <b>file.txt</b> in any directory.  If you want to match complete paths, you can prefix the
       filename with a <b>/</b>: <b>-exclude-wildcard</b> <b>/file.txt</b> excludes only <b>file.txt</b> in the root of the mounted filesys‐
       tem.

       If there are many exclusions, you can use <b>-exclude-from</b> to read gitignore patterns from a file.  As  with
       <b>-exclude-wildcard</b>, use a leading <b>/</b> to match complete paths.

       The  rules  for exclusion are that of gitignore (https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format).  In
       short:

       1. A blank line matches no files, so it can serve as a separator for readability.

       2. A line starting with <b>#</b> serves as a comment.  Put a backslash (<b>\</b>) in front of the first hash  for  pat‐
          terns that begin with a hash.

       3. Trailing spaces are ignored unless they are quoted with backslash (<b>\</b>).

       4. An optional prefix <b>!</b> negates the pattern; any matching file excluded by a previous pattern will become
          included again.  It is not possible to re-include a file if a parent directory of that file is exclud‐
          ed.   Put  a backslash (<b>\</b>) in front of the first <b>!</b> for patterns that begin with a literal <b>!</b>, for exam‐
          ple, <b>\!important!.txt</b>.

       5. If the pattern ends with a slash, it is removed for the purpose of the following description,  but  it
          would  only  find a match with a directory.  In other words, <b>foo/</b> will match a directory foo and paths
          underneath it, but will not match a regular file or a symbolic link foo.

       6. If the pattern does not contain a slash <b>/</b>, it is treated as a shell glob pattern  and  checked  for  a
          match against the pathname relative to the root of the mounted filesystem.

       7. Otherwise,  the  pattern  is  treated  as a shell glob suitable for consumption by <a href="../man3/fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch</a>(3) with the
          FNM_PATHNAME flag: wildcards in the pattern will not match a <b>/</b> in the pathname.  For example, <b>Documen‐</b>
          <b>tation/*.html</b> matches <b>Documentation/git.html</b> but not <b>Documentation/ppc/ppc.html</b> or <b>tools/perf/Documen‐</b>
          <b>tation/perf.html</b>.

       8. A leading slash matches the beginning of the pathname.  For example, <b>/*.c</b> matches <b>cat-file.c</b>  but  not
          <b>mozilla-sha1/sha1.c</b>.

       9. Two consecutive asterisks (<b>**</b>) in patterns matched against full pathname may have special meaning:

             i. A  leading  <b>**</b>  followed by a slash means match in all directories.  For example, <b>**/foo</b> matches
                file or directory <b>foo</b> anywhere, the same as pattern <b>foo</b>.  <b>**/foo/bar</b> matches file  or  directory
                <b>bar</b> anywhere that is directly under directory <b>foo</b>.

            ii. A trailing <b>/**</b> matches everything inside.  For example, <b>abc/**</b> matches all files inside directo‐
                ry <b>abc</b>, with infinite depth.

           iii. A  slash  followed  by  two consecutive asterisks then a slash matches zero or more directories.
                For example, <b>a/**/b</b> matches <b>a/b</b>, <b>a/x/b</b>, <b>a/x/y/b</b> and so on.

            iv. Other consecutive asterisks are considered invalid.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Init</b>
       Create an encrypted filesystem in directory “mydir.crypt”, mount it on “mydir”:

              mkdir mydir.crypt mydir
              gocryptfs -init mydir.crypt
              gocryptfs mydir.crypt mydir

   <b>Mount</b>
       Mount an encrypted view of joe’s home directory using reverse mode:

              mkdir /home/joe.crypt
              gocryptfs -init -reverse /home/joe
              gocryptfs -reverse /home/joe /home/joe.crypt

   <b>fstab</b>
       Adding this line to <b><a href="file:/etc/fstab">/etc/fstab</a></b> will mount <b>/tmp/cipher</b> to  <b>/tmp/plain</b>  on  boot,  using  the  password  in
       <b>/tmp/passfile</b>.   Use <b>sudo</b> <b>mount</b> <b>-av</b> to test the line without having to reboot.  Adjust the gocryptfs path
       acc.  to the output of the command <b>which</b> <b>gocryptfs</b>.  Do use the <b>nofail</b> option to  prevent  an  unbootable
       system if the gocryptfs mount fails (see the <b>-nofail</b> option for details).

              /tmp/cipher /tmp/plain fuse./usr/local/bin/gocryptfs nofail,allow_other,passfile=/tmp/password 0 0

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>NO_COLOR</b>
       If <b>NO_COLOR</b> is set (regardless of value), colored output is disabled (see https://no-color.org/).

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       0: success
       6: CIPHERDIR is not an empty directory (on “-init”)
       10: MOUNTPOINT is not an empty directory
       12: password incorrect
       22: password is empty (on “-init”)
       23: could not read gocryptfs.conf
       24: could not write gocryptfs.conf (on “-init” or “-password”)
       26: fsck found errors
       other: please check the error message

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Dash</b> <b>duplication</b>
       gocryptfs v2.1 switched to the <b>pflag</b> library for command-line parsing to support flags and positional ar‐
       guments  in  any order.  To stay compatible with single-dash long options like <b>-extpass</b>, an ugly hack was
       added: The command line is preprocessed, and all single-dash options are converted to double-dash.

       Unfortunately, this means that in

              gocryptfs -extpass myapp -extpass -X

       gocryptfs transforms the <b>-X</b> to <b>--X</b>, and it will call <b>myapp</b> <b>--X</b> as the extpass program.

       Please use

              gocryptfs -extpass myapp -extpass=-X

       to work around this bug.
