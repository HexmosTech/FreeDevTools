       nbdkit-ondemand-plugin - create filesystems on demand

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        nbdkit ondemand dir=EXPORTSDIR [size=]SIZE [wait=true] [share=true]
                        { [type=ext4|xfs|vfat|...] [label=LABEL]
                          | command=COMMAND [VAR=VALUE ...] }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a plugin for <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit.1.html">nbdkit</a></b>(1) which creates persistent filesystems on demand.  Clients may simply
       connect to the server, requesting a particular export name, and a new filesystem is created if it does
       not exist already.  Clients can also disconnect and reconnect with the same export name and the same
       filesystem will still be available.  Filesystems are stored in a directory on the server, so they persist
       over server restarts.

       By default each export is locked while it is in use by a client, preventing two clients from accessing
       the same filesystem (which would cause corruption).

       Similar plugins include <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-file-plugin.1.html">nbdkit-file-plugin</a></b>(1) which can serve a predefined set of exports (clients cannot
       create more), <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-tmpdisk-plugin.1.html">nbdkit-tmpdisk-plugin</a></b>(1) which creates a fresh temporary filesystem for each client, and
       <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-linuxdisk-plugin.1.html">nbdkit-linuxdisk-plugin</a></b>(1) which exports a single filesystem from a local directory on the server.

   <b>Export</b> <b>names</b>
       When a new export name is requested by a client, a sparse file of the same name is created in
       "dir=EXPORTSDIR" on the server.  The file will be formatted with <b><a href="../man8/mkfs.8.html">mkfs</a></b>(8).  The size of the file is
       currently fixed by the "size=SIZE" parameter, but we intend to make this client-configurable in future.
       The filesystem type and label may also be specified, otherwise "ext4" and no label is used.

       Export names must be â‰¤ "NAME_MAX" (usually 255) bytes in length and must not contain certain characters
       including "." at the start, and "/".  There may be other limitations added in future.  Client requests
       which do not obey these restrictions are rejected.  As a special case, export name "" is mapped to the
       file name <u>default</u>.

   <b>Security</b> <b>considerations</b>
       You should <b>only</b> use this in an environment where you trust all your clients, since clients can use this
       plugin to consume arbitrary amounts of disk space by creating unlimited exports.  It is therefore best to
       take steps to limit where clients can connect from using <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-ip-filter.1.html">nbdkit-ip-filter</a></b>(1), firewalls, or TLS client
       certificates.

   <b>The</b> <b>command</b> <b>parameter</b>
       Instead of running mkfs you can run an arbitrary command or shell script to create the disk.

       The other parameters to the plugin are turned into shell variables passed to the command.  For example
       "type" becomes the shell variable $type, etc.  Any parameters you want can be passed to the plugin and
       will be turned into shell variables (not only "type" and "label") making this a very flexible method to
       create filesystems and disks of all kinds.

       Two special variables are also passed to the shell script fragment:

       $disk
           The  absolute  path of the disk file.  This is partially controlled by the client so you should quote
           it carefully.  This file is not pre-created, the command must create it for example using:

            truncate -s $size "$disk"

       $size
           The virtual size in bytes.  This is the "size" parameter, converted to bytes.  Note  the  final  size
           served to the client is whatever disk size "command" creates.

   <b>Dead</b> <b>client</b> <b>detection</b>
       Clients  which "go away" without disconnecting (such as clients which reboot) may cause exports to remain
       locked when they are no longer used.  Practically this can cause problems such as the same  client  being
       unable  to  reconnect after a reboot.  To avoid this you should enable keepalives to detect dead clients.
       Use the nbdkit <u>--keepalive</u> option, or for more fine-grained control see the discussion of  keepalives  in
       <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit-service.1.html">nbdkit-service</a></b>(1).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Run the server like this:

        mkdir /var/tmp/exports
        nbdkit ondemand dir=/var/tmp/exports 1G

       Clients  can  connect  and  create  1G  ext4 filesystems on demand using commands such as these (note the
       different export names):

        nbd-client server /dev/nbd0 -N export1
        mount /dev/nbd0 <a href="file:/mnt">/mnt</a>

        guestfish --format=raw -a nbd://localhost/export2 -m /dev/sda

        qemu-img info nbd:localhost:10809:exportname=export2

       On the server you would see two filesystems created:

        $ ls -l /var/tmp/exports
        -rw-rw-r--. 1 rjones rjones 1073741824 Aug 13 21:40 export1
        -rw-rw-r--. 1 rjones rjones 1073741824 Aug 13 21:40 export2

       The plugin does not clean these up.  If they are no longer needed then the  server  admin  should  delete
       them (or use a tmp cleaner).

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>command='</b>COMMAND<b>'</b>
           Instead  of  running <b><a href="../man8/mkfs.8.html">mkfs</a></b>(8) to create the initial filesystem, run "COMMAND" (a shell script fragment
           which usually must be quoted to protect it from the shell).  See "The command parameter" above.

       <b>dir=</b>EXPORTSDIR
           The directory where filesystems are saved.  When first using this plugin you should point this to  an
           empty directory.  When clients connect, filesystems are created here.

           This parameter is required.

       <b>label=</b>LABEL
           Select the filesystem label.  The default is not set.

       <b>share=true</b>
           If  set, the export is not locked.  Two or more clients may connect to the same export.  This usually
           results in filesystem corruption (if using a regular filesystem like ext4), so you have to  use  some
           other means to guarantee exclusive access or to ensure sharing is safe.

       [<b>size=</b>]SIZE
           Specify the virtual size of all of the filesystems.

           If using "command", this is only a suggested size.  The actual size of the resulting disk will be the
           size of the disk created by "command".

           This parameter is required.

           "size=" is a magic config key and may be omitted in most cases.  See "Magic parameters" in <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit.1.html">nbdkit</a></b>(1).

       <b>type=</b>FS
           Select the filesystem type.  The default is "ext4".  Most non-networked, non-cluster filesystem types
           supported by the <b><a href="../man8/mkfs.8.html">mkfs</a></b>(8) command can be used here.

       <b>wait=true</b>
           If set, if two clients try to connect at the same time to the same export then the second client will
           wait  for  the  first  to  disconnect.  The default behaviour is to reject the second client with the
           error message:

            filesystem is locked by another client

           This setting is sometimes useful if you are making repeated connections and at the network level  the
           first  connection  does not fully disconnect before the next connection starts.  This can also happen
           as a side-effect of using "guestfish --ro" which opens two NBD connections in quick succession.

           If "share=true" then locking is not used and the "wait" parameter has no effect.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
