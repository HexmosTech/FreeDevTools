</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       inotifywait, fsnotifywait - wait for changes to files using inotify or fanotify

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>inotifywait</b> [<b>-hcmrPq</b>] [<b>-e</b> &lt;event&gt; ] [<b>-t</b> &lt;seconds&gt; ] [<b>--format</b> &lt;fmt&gt; ] [<b>--timefmt</b> &lt;fmt&gt; ] &lt;file&gt; [ ... ]

       <b>fsnotifywait</b> [<b>-hcmrPqIFS</b>] [<b>-e</b> &lt;event&gt; ] [<b>-t</b> &lt;seconds&gt; ] [<b>--format</b> &lt;fmt&gt; ] [<b>--timefmt</b> &lt;fmt&gt; ] &lt;file&gt; [ ...
       ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>inotifywait</b>  efficiently  waits  for changes to files using Linux's <b><a href="../man7/inotify.7.html">inotify</a>(7)</b> interface.  It is suitable
       for waiting for changes to files from shell scripts.  It  can  either  exit  once  an  event  occurs,  or
       continually execute and output events as they occur.

       <b>fsnotifywait</b>  is  similar  to  <b>inotifywait</b>  but  it is using Linux's <b><a href="../man7/fanotify.7.html">fanotify</a>(7)</b> interface by default. If
       explicitly specified, it uses the <b><a href="../man7/inotify.7.html">inotify</a>(7)</b> interface.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>inotifywait</b> and <b>fsnotifywait</b> will output diagnostic information on standard error and  event  information
       on  standard  output.   The  event  output  can be configured, but by default it consists of lines of the
       following form:

       <b>watched_filename</b> <b>EVENT_NAMES</b> <b>event_filename</b>

       <b>watched_filename</b>
              is the name of the file on which the event occurred.  If the file is a directory, a trailing slash
              is output.

       <b>EVENT_NAMES</b>
              are the names of the inotify events which occurred, separated by commas.

       <b>event_filename</b>
              is output only when the event occurred on a directory, and in this  case  the  name  of  the  file
              within the directory which caused this event is output.

              By  default,  any  special  characters in filenames are not escaped in any way.  This can make the
              output of inotifywait difficult to parse in awk  scripts  or  similar.   The  <b>--csv</b>  and  <b>--format</b>
              options will be helpful in this case.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Output some helpful usage information.

       <b>@&lt;file&gt;</b>
              When  watching  a  directory tree recursively, exclude the specified file from being watched.  The
              file must be specified with a relative or  absolute  path  according  to  whether  a  relative  or
              absolute  path  is  given for watched directories.  If a specific path is explicitly both included
              and excluded, it will always be watched.

              <b>Note:</b> If you need to watch a directory or file whose name starts with @, give the absolute path.

       <b>--fromfile</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Read filenames to watch or exclude from a file, one filename per line.  If filenames begin with  @
              they  are  excluded as described above.  If &lt;file&gt; is `-', filenames are read from standard input.
              Use this option if you need to watch too many files to pass in as command line arguments.

       <b>-m,</b> <b>--monitor</b>
              Instead of exiting after receiving a single event, execute indefinitely.  The default behaviour is
              to exit after the first event occurs.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--daemon</b>
              Same as --monitor, except run in the background logging events to a file that must be specified by
              --outfile. Implies --syslog.

       <b>-o,</b> <b>--outfile</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Output events to &lt;file&gt; rather than stdout.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--syslog</b>
              Output errors to <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a>(3)</b> system log module rather than stderr.

       <b>-P,</b> <b>--no-dereference</b>
              Do not follow symlinks.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--recursive</b>
              Watch all subdirectories of  any  directories  passed  as  arguments.   Watches  will  be  set  up
              recursively   to   an   unlimited  depth.   Symbolic  links  are  not  traversed.   Newly  created
              subdirectories will also be watched.

              <b>Warning:</b> If you use this option while watching the root directory of a large  tree,  it  may  take
              quite  a  while until all inotify watches are established, and events will not be received in this
              time.  Also, since one inotify watch will be established per subdirectory, it is possible that the
              maximum amount of inotify watches per user will be reached.  The default maximum is 8192;  it  can
              be increased by writing to <b><a href="file:/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches">/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches</a></b>.

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b>
              If  specified once, the program will be less verbose.  Specifically, it will not state when it has
              completed establishing all inotify watches.

              If specified twice, the program will output nothing at all, except in the case of fatal errors.

       <b>--exclude</b> <b>&lt;pattern&gt;</b>
              Do not process any events for the subset of  files  whose  filenames  match  the  specified  POSIX
              regular expression, case sensitive.

       <b>--excludei</b> <b>&lt;pattern&gt;</b>
              Do  not  process  any  events  for  the  subset of files whose filenames match the specified POSIX
              regular expression, case insensitive.

       <b>--include</b> <b>&lt;pattern&gt;</b>
              Process events only for the subset of files whose filenames  match  the  specified  POSIX  regular
              expression, case sensitive.

       <b>--includei</b> <b>&lt;pattern&gt;</b>
              Process  events  only  for  the  subset of files whose filenames match the specified POSIX regular
              expression, case insensitive.

       <b>-t</b> <b>&lt;seconds&gt;,</b> <b>--timeout</b> <b>&lt;seconds&gt;</b>
              Exit if an appropriate event has not occurred within &lt;seconds&gt; seconds. If &lt;seconds&gt; is zero  (the
              default), wait indefinitely for an event.

       <b>-e</b> <b>&lt;event&gt;,</b> <b>--event</b> <b>&lt;event&gt;</b>
              Listen  for specific event(s) only.  The events which can be listened for are listed in the <b>EVENTS</b>
              section.  This option can be specified more than once.  If omitted, all events are listened for.

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--csv</b>
              Output in CSV (comma-separated values) format.  This is useful when filenames may contain  spaces,
              since in this case it is not safe to simply split the output at each space character.

       <b>--timefmt</b> <b>&lt;fmt&gt;</b>
              Set  a  time  format  string  as  accepted  by <a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a>(3) for use with the `%T' conversion in the
              --format option.

       <b>--no-newline</b>
              Don't print newline symbol after user-specified format in the --format option.

       <b>--format</b> <b>&lt;fmt&gt;</b>
              Output in a user-specified format, using printf-like syntax.  The event strings output are limited
              to around 4000 characters and will be truncated to this length.   The  following  conversions  are
              supported:

       %w     This will be replaced with the name of the Watched file on which an event occurred.  When an event
              occurs  within  a Watched directory or when watching with fanotify, this will be replaced with the
              name of the Directory in which the event occurred.

       %f     When an event occurs within a Watched directory or when  watching  with  fanotify,  this  will  be
              replaced  with  the  name  of  the  File which caused the event to occur.  Otherwise, this will be
              replaced with an empty string.

       %e     Replaced with the Event(s) which occurred, comma-separated.

       %Xe    Replaced with the Event(s) which occurred, separated by whichever character is  in  the  place  of
              `X'.

       %T     Replaced  with the current Time in the format specified by the --timefmt option, which should be a
              format string suitable for passing to <a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a>(3).

       %0     Replaced with NUL.

       %n     Replaced with Line Feed.

   <b>fsnotifywait</b>
       The following additional options are available:

       <b>-I,</b> <b>--inotify</b>
              Watch using inotify.

       <b>-F,</b> <b>--fanotify</b>
              Watch using fanotify (default).  fanotify support for reporting  events  with  inotify  compatible
              information  was  added  in  kernel v5.9.  With older kernels the command will fail.  As of kernel
              v5.12, fanotify requires admin privileges.

       <b>-S,</b> <b>--filesystem</b>
              Watch entire filesystem of any directories passed as arguments using fanotify.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>0</b>      The program executed successfully, and an event occurred which was being listened for.

       <b>1</b>      An error occurred in execution of the program, or an event occurred which was not  being  listened
              for.   The  latter generally occurs if something happens which forcibly removes the inotify watch,
              such as a watched file being deleted or the filesystem containing a watched file being unmounted.

       <b>2</b>      The <b>-t</b> option was used and an event did not occur in the specified interval of time.

</pre><h4><b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       The following events are valid for use with the <b>-e</b> option:

       <b>access</b> A watched file or a file within a watched directory was read from.

       <b>modify</b> A watched file or a file within a watched directory was written to.

       <b>attrib</b> The metadata of a watched file or a file within a watched directory was modified.   This  includes
              timestamps, file permissions, extended attributes etc.

       <b>close_write</b>
              A  watched  file  or  a file within a watched directory was closed, after being opened in writable
              mode.  This does not necessarily imply the file was written to.

       <b>close_nowrite</b>
              A watched file or a file within a watched directory was closed, after being  opened  in  read-only
              mode.

       <b>close</b>  A  watched  file or a file within a watched directory was closed, regardless of how it was opened.
              Note that this is actually implemented simply by listening for both <b>close_write</b> and <b>close_nowrite,</b>
              hence all close events received will be output as one of these, not <b>CLOSE.</b>

       <b>open</b>   A watched file or a file within a watched directory was opened.

       <b>moved_to</b>
              A file or directory was moved into a watched directory.  This event occurs even  if  the  file  is
              simply moved from and to the same directory.

       <b>moved_from</b>
              A  file  or  directory  was moved from a watched directory.  This event occurs even if the file is
              simply moved from and to the same directory.

       <b>move</b>   A file or directory was moved from or  to  a  watched  directory.   Note  that  this  is  actually
              implemented  simply  by listening for both <b>moved_to</b> and <b>moved_from,</b> hence all move events received
              will be output as one or both of these, not <b>MOVE.</b>

       <b>move_self</b>
              A watched file or directory was moved. After this event, the file or directory is no longer  being
              watched.

       <b>create</b> A file or directory was created within a watched directory.

       <b>delete</b> A file or directory within a watched directory was deleted.

       <b>delete_self</b>
              A  watched  file  or  directory  was deleted.  After this event the file or directory is no longer
              being watched.  Note that this event can occur even if it is not explicitly being listened for.

       <b>unmount</b>
              The filesystem on which a watched file or directory resides was unmounted.  After this  event  the
              file  or  directory  is no longer being watched.  Note that this event can occur even if it is not
              explicitly being listened to.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Example</b> <b>1</b>
       Running inotifywait at the command-line to wait for any file in the  `test'  directory  to  be  accessed.
       After running inotifywait, `cat test/foo' is run in a separate console.

       % inotifywait test
       Setting up watches.
       Watches established.
       test/ ACCESS foo

   <b>Example</b> <b>2</b>
       A short shell script to efficiently wait for httpd-related log messages and do something appropriate.

       #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
       while ! inotifywait -e modify /var/log/messages; do
         if tail -n1 /var/log/messages | grep httpd; then
           kdialog --msgbox "Apache needs love!"
         fi
       done

   <b>Example</b> <b>3</b>
       A  custom  output format is used to watch `<a href="file:~/test">~/test</a>'.  Meanwhile, someone runs `touch <a href="file:~/test/badfile">~/test/badfile</a>; touch
       <a href="file:~/test/goodfile">~/test/goodfile</a>; rm <a href="file:~/test/badfile">~/test/badfile</a>' in another console.

       % inotifywait -m -r --format '%:e %f' <a href="file:~/test">~/test</a>
       Setting up watches.  Beware: since -r was given, this may take a while!
       Watches established.
       CREATE badfile
       OPEN badfile
       ATTRIB badfile
       CLOSE_WRITE:CLOSE badfile
       CREATE goodfile
       OPEN goodfile
       ATTRIB goodfile
       CLOSE_WRITE:CLOSE goodfile
       DELETE badfile

   <b>Example</b> <b>4</b>
       Enforce file permissions in directory `<a href="file:~/test">~/test</a>'

       inotifywait -qmr -e 'moved_to,create' --format '%w%f%0' --no-newline <a href="file:~/test">~/test</a> |\
           while IFS= read -r -d '' file
           do
              chmod -v a+rX "$file"
           done

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       When using inotifywait, the filename that is outputted is not guaranteed to be up to date  after  a  move
       because  it  is  the  inode  that  is  being monitored. Additionally, none of the observed operations are
       guaranteed to have been performed on the filename inotifywait was instructed to monitor in cases when the
       file is known by several names in the filesystem.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       There are race conditions in the recursive directory watching code which can cause events to be missed if
       they occur in a directory immediately after that directory is created.  This is probably not fixable.

       It is assumed the inotify event queue will never overflow.
