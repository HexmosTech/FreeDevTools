</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       party - set OS responses mode

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>party</b> <b>ON|OFF|WHEREIS</b> <b>[</b> <b>-</b> <b>]</b> <b>dnv</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Operating   systems  being  what they are,  the admin people can easily  grow tired of  command responses
       that resemble dyslexic eugene-speak   filtered   through   Kernighan   and   Ritchie's collective   back-
       brains.   To  alleviate this, we have included a slightly  more  `casual'  mode,  in  which the responses
       to all commands  are  first filtered  through  a  customising  routine <b>(DUDE)</b> , which  makes them   sound
       a  little  more   friendly while retaining their  full  information   content  (usually).   The rooted(c)
       system prompt is  changed to  `What now,  dude?' and output  from  each  command  is  terminated  by  `No
       problem, dude.'

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-v</b>     Verbose  mode   (ALL  commands   have   a  `verbose'  mode).  When  this  option is  present,  all
              filtered responses are  preceded  by a message: `This response has been parsed by the <b>DUDE</b>  filter
              and is not intended to be some sort of sleazy come-on.'

       <b>-d</b>     Don't   restart   all   processes   after   recompiling  the <b>/uselss/libs/eugene</b> file (see below).
              This allows any important tasks to complete beforehand.

       <b>-n</b>     Notify  all  users  that  they  are about to be force-logged out and force-logged in again.

       <b>ON</b>     Activates the <b>DUDE</b> filter.

       <b>OFF</b>    De-activates the <b>DUDE</b> filter.

       <b>WHEREIS</b>
              Doesn't do anything, but we couldn't resist it.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       %-)  party on

       What now, dude?

       To compare  the differing responses, here is output provided by the ispi -s command, with party  OFF  and
       party ON:

       party OFF

       line     who       why                         how long
       ==========================================================
       000      rooted    that's you, dweeb!          epoch
       ----------------------------------------------------------
       00F      wp        she's supposed to be        0:44:12
                          typing up the end of
                          financial year report,
                          but she's been doing her
                          resume when she thinks
                          no-one is watching
       ----------------------------------------------------------
       014      maint     playing games, as usual     0:51:16

       party ON

       Well,   let's  see  who's on, eh?  There's you, of course, on line 000 (Imagine that!  Hahaha!)  Oh look,
       on serIOus line 00F,  it's that cute little secretary - looks  like  she's  lost  her  keyboard  template
       again,  she's been hitting the escape key for the past five minutes!  AND  OF  COURSE, the  guys  down in
       maintenance are playing `cosmic ballcrushers'.   As  usual.    Well,   who   else,   um,   no-one  really
       interesting  like,  ya know, oh hang on,  DTR is toggling on serIOus line 03D.. oh, no problem, it's that
       stuffed modem again.  You want maybe I should send  some AMail to maintenance  and get 'em to look at it?
       No problem, dude.

       What now, dude?

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/uselss/libs/bill&amp;ted/DUDE</b>
              This  is  the pipe process,  usually
              started  at system shoe,  which lies
              idle until party ON is issued.

       <b>/uselss/libs/eugene</b>
              Contains all of the ordinary, ho-hum
              confusing   computer   -   jargonese
              responses  which commands ordinarily
              issue.  Text file.

       <b>/uselss/libs/eugene.spoo</b>
              compiled version of the eugene file.

       <b>/ephemeral/eugene.chex</b>
              Checksum  for  the  compiled  eugene file.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>-n</b> option can be slow.

       If  the n option is issued,  some users in a wi editing session may not  receive the   `warning,  restart
       imminent' message until after the restart.

       There is no way selectively to follow symbolic links.
