       stda -  Simple Tools for Data Analysis (STDA)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       STDA  includes  some  primary  tools  for  data  analysis.  You  can  evaluate sums, averages, integrals,
       derivatives, histograms or probability distribution functions  of  1-d  data,  and  eventually  plot  the
       results.  The  programs  are  stand-alone tools (supporting the standard UNIX input and output pipelines)
       intended for data processing from the command line. It should be noted that all but one  of  the  scripts
       use  awk  and  core  system utilities. For plotting you have to install Gnuplot (see <a href="http://gnuplot.info">http://gnuplot.info</a>)
       since 'muplot' is a wrapper around it. In summary, the package  provides  utilities  for  straightforward
       analysis of data series where a complex analytical approach is not needed and where an ultimate numerical
       precision with floating-point numbers is not critical. Some general examples of application cases include
       evaluating  usage statistics from server logfiles, determining a response time distribution from a series
       of queries to a [remote] service, producing a plot from multiple data files, etc.

       This software should be considered as an open  project  to  be  extended  with  new  command-line  driven
       utilities  helpful  for  performing  common  data  analysis  tasks. Any contributions and suggestions are
       welcome.

       Following programs are included in the distribution:

       * maphimbu   - histogram builder for 1-d numerical and text data

       * mintegrate - average/sum/integral/derivative of 1-d numerical data

       * mmval      - find minimum and maximum value in a dataset

       * muplot     - plot a multi-curve figure from multiple dataset using Gnuplot

       * nnum       - produce a series of equally separated integers or floats

       * prefield   - prepare input file for 'muplot' to plot 2-d fields by arrows

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       - Evaluate the  current  apache2  logfile  and  make  an  unique  list  of  the  hostnames  (respectively
       ip-addresses) sorted by the total number of their http requests:

              maphimbu -rs2 /var/log/apache2/access.log

       -  On  a  X terminal plot the probability function and the cumulative distribution function of a 'sin(x)'
       data sample:

              nnum -3.14159 3.14159 0.00001 "sin(x)" "%.17f %.7f" | maphimbu -d0.01 -x1 -ns1 | mintegrate -d0.01
              -x1 -y3 -S | muplot lp - 1:3,4
