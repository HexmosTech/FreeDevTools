       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              show this help message and exit

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--ifile</b> IFILE
              MACS score in bedGraph. REQUIRED

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--cutoff</b> CUTOFF
              Cutoff depends on which method you used for score track. If the file contains pvalue  scores  from
              MACS3,  score  5 means pvalue 1e-5. Regions with signals lower than cutoff will not be considerred
              as enriched regions. DEFAULT: 5

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--min-length</b> MINLEN
              minimum length of peak, better to set it as d value.  DEFAULT: 200

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--max-gap</b> MAXGAP
              maximum gap between significant points in a peak, better to set it as tag size. DEFAULT: 30

       <b>--cutoff-analysis</b>
              While set, bdgpeakcall will analyze number or  total  length  of  peaks  that  can  be  called  by
              different cutoff then output a summary table to help user decide a better cutoff. Note, minlen and
              maxgap may affect the results. DEFAULT: False

       <b>--cutoff-analysis-max</b> CUTOFF_ANALYSIS_MAX
              The  maximum  cutoff  score for performing cutoff analysis. Together with <b>--cutoff-analysis-steps</b>,
              the resolution  in  the  final  report  can  be  controlled.   Please  check  the  description  in
              <b>--cutoff-analysissteps</b> for detail. DEFAULT: 100

       <b>--cutoff-analysis-steps</b> CUTOFF_ANALYSIS_STEPS
              Steps  for  performing  cutoff  analysis.  It  will be used to decide which cutoff value should be
              included in the final report. Larger the value, higher resolution the cutoff analysis can be.  The
              cutoff  analysis function will first find the smallest (at least 0) and the largest (controlled by
              <b>--cutoff-analysis-max</b>)   score   in   the   data,   then   break   the   range   of   score   into
              `CUTOFF_ANALYSIS_STEPS`  intervals.  It  will  then  use  each  score  as cutoff to call peaks and
              calculate the total number of candidate peaks, the total  basepairs  of  peaks,  and  the  average
              length  of  peak  in  basepair.   Please  note  that  the  final  report  ideally  should  include
              `CUTOFF_ANALYSIS_STEPS` rows, but in practice, if the cutoff yield zero peak,  the  row  for  that
              value won't be included. DEFAULT: 100

       <b>--no-trackline</b>
              Tells  MACS  not  to  include trackline with bedGraph files. The trackline is used by UCSC for the
              options for display.

       <b>--verbose</b> VERBOSE
              Set verbose level of runtime message. 0: only show critical message, 1:  show  additional  warning
              message, 2: show process information, 3: show debug messages.  DEFAULT:2

       <b>--outdir</b> OUTDIR
              If  specified  all  output  files  will be written to that directory. Default: the current working
              directory

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--ofile</b> OFILE
              Output file name. Mutually exclusive with <b>--o-prefix</b>.

       <b>--o-prefix</b> OPREFIX
              Output file prefix. Mutually exclusive with <b>-o</b>/--ofile.
