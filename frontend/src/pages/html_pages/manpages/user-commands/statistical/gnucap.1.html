</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gnucap - GNU Circuit Analysis Package

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gnucap</b> [<b>-b</b> filename] [<b>-i</b> filename] [filename]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Gnucap</b>  is a general purpose circuit simulator.  It performs nonlinear dc and transient analyses, fourier
       analysis, and ac analysis linearized at an operating point.  It is fully interactive and command  driven.
       It  can  also  be  run  in  batch  mode  or  as a server.  The output is produced as it simulates.  Spice
       compatible models for the MOSFET (level 1,2,3) and diode are included in this release.

       Since it is fully interactive, it is possible to make changes and re-simulate quickly.   The  interactive
       design  makes it well suited to the typical iterative design process used it optimizing a circuit design.
       It is also well suited to undergraduate teaching where Spice in batch mode  can  be  quite  intimidating.
       This  version,  while  still  officially  in  beta  test, should be stable enough for basic undergraduate
       teaching and courses in MOS design, but not for bipolar design.

       In batch mode it is mostly Spice compatible, so it is often possible to use the same file for both Gnucap
       and Spice.

       The analog simulation is based on traditional nodal analysis with iteration by  Newton's  method  and  LU
       decomposition.  An event queue and incremental matrix update speed up the solution for large circuits (at
       some expense for small circuits).

       It  also  has  digital  devices  for  mixed signal simulation.  The digital devices may be implemented as
       either analog subcircuits or as true digital models.  The simulator will automatically determine which to
       use.  Networks of digital devices are simulated as digital, with no conversions to analog between  gates.
       This  results  in  digital  circuits being simulated faster than on a typical analog simulator, even with
       behavioral models.  The digital  mode  is  experimental  and  needs  work.   There  will  be  substantial
       improvements in future releases.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Two  command-line  options are available. Only one of these may be specified. If no parameters are given,
       gnucap will start in interactive mode.

       <u>-b</u> <u>filename</u>
              execute the commands in the named file then exit (batch mode)

       <u>-i</u> <u>filename</u>
              execute the commands in the named file then go into interactive mode

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       See <b>/usr/share/doc/gnucap/bugs</b> for a list of known bugs in this release.

       Gnucap is an ongoing research project.  It is being released in a preliminary phase in hopes that it will
       be useful and that others will use it as a thrust or base for their  research.   I  also  hope  for  some
       comments that may help me direct my research.
