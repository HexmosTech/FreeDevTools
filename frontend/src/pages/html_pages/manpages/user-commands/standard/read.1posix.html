</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       read — read from standard input into shell variables

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       read <b>[</b>-r<b>]</b> <u>var</u>...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>read</u> utility shall read a single logical line from standard input into one or more shell variables.

       By default, unless the <b>-r</b> option is specified, &lt;backslash&gt; shall act as an escape character. An unescaped
       &lt;backslash&gt;  shall  preserve  the  literal  value  of  the  following  character, with the exception of a
       &lt;newline&gt;.  If a &lt;newline&gt; follows the &lt;backslash&gt;,  the  <u>read</u>  utility  shall  interpret  this  as  line
       continuation.  The &lt;backslash&gt; and &lt;newline&gt; shall be removed before splitting the input into fields. All
       other unescaped &lt;backslash&gt; characters shall be removed after splitting the input into fields.

       If standard input is a terminal device and the invoking shell is interactive, <u>read</u>  shall  prompt  for  a
       continuation  line  when it reads an input line ending with a &lt;backslash&gt; &lt;newline&gt;, unless the <b>-r</b> option
       is specified.

       The terminating &lt;newline&gt; (if any) shall be removed from the input and the results shall  be  split  into
       fields  as  in the shell for the results of parameter expansion (see <u>Section</u> <u>2.6.5</u>, <u>Field</u> <u>Splitting</u>); the
       first field shall be assigned to the first variable <u>var</u>, the second field to the second variable <u>var</u>, and
       so on. If there are fewer fields than there are <u>var</u> operands, the remaining <u>var</u>s shall be  set  to  empty
       strings.  If  there  are  fewer  <u>var</u>s  than  fields,  the last <u>var</u> shall be set to a value comprising the
       following elements:

        *  The field that corresponds to the last <u>var</u> in the normal assignment sequence described above

        *  The delimiter(s) that follow the field corresponding to the last <u>var</u>

        *  The remaining fields and their delimiters, with trailing <u>IFS</u> white space ignored

       The setting of variables specified  by  the  <u>var</u>  operands  shall  affect  the  current  shell  execution
       environment;  see  <u>Section</u>  <u>2.12</u>, <u>Shell</u> <u>Execution</u> <u>Environment</u>.  If it is called in a subshell or separate
       utility execution environment, such as one of the following:

           (read foo)
           nohup read ...
           find . -exec read ... \;

       it shall not affect the shell variables in the caller's environment.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>read</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>12.2</u>,  <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The following option is supported:

       <b>-r</b>        Do  not  treat a &lt;backslash&gt; character in any special way. Consider each &lt;backslash&gt; to be part
                 of the input line.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <u>var</u>       The name of an existing or nonexisting shell variable.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       The standard input shall be a text file.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>read</u>:

       <u>IFS</u>       Determine the internal field separators used  to  delimit  fields;  see  <u>Section</u>  <u>2.5.3</u>,  <u>Shell</u>
                 <u>Variables</u>.

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> for the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used  to affect the format and contents of diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

       <u>PS2</u>       Provide the prompt string that an interactive shell shall write to standard error when  a  line
                 ending with a &lt;backslash&gt; &lt;newline&gt; is read and the <b>-r</b> option was not specified.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used for diagnostic messages and prompts for continued input.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    End-of-file was detected or an error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>-r</b>  option  is  included  to  enable  <u>read</u>  to subsume the purpose of the <u>line</u> utility, which is not
       included in POSIX.1‐2008.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following command:

           while read -r xx yy
           do
               printf "%s %s\n$yy$xx"
           done &lt; <u>input_file</u>

       prints a file with the first field of each line moved to the end of the line.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>read</u> utility historically has been a shell built-in. It was separated off into  its  own  utility  to
       take advantage of the richer description of functionality introduced by this volume of POSIX.1‐2017.

       Since  <u>read</u>  affects the current shell execution environment, it is generally provided as a shell regular
       built-in. If it is called in a subshell or separate utility execution environment, such  as  one  of  the
       following:

           (read foo)
           nohup read ...
           find . -exec read ... \;

       it does not affect the shell variables in the environment of the caller.

       Although the standard input is required to be a text file, and therefore will always end with a &lt;newline&gt;
       (unless  it  is  an  empty file), the processing of continuation lines when the <b>-r</b> option is not used can
       result in the input not ending with a &lt;newline&gt;.  This occurs if the last line of  the  input  file  ends
       with  a  &lt;backslash&gt;  &lt;newline&gt;.   It  is  for  this  reason that ``if any'' is used in ``The terminating
       &lt;newline&gt; (if any) shall be removed from the input'' in the description.  It is not a relaxation  of  the
       requirement for standard input to be a text file.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
