</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cue2toc - convert CUE to TOC format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cue2toc</b> [<b>-dhqv</b>] [<b>-o</b> <u>tocfile</u>] [<u>cuefile</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Cue2toc</b>  converts  <u>cuefile</u> from CUE to TOC format and writes the result to <u>tocfile</u>.  If either <u>cuefile</u> or
       <u>tocfile</u> is omitted or a single dash "-" <b>cue2toc</b> reads from standard input and writes  to  standard  ouput
       respectively.

       CUE files are text files describing the layout of a CD-Rom and typically carry the extension ".cue".

       Cdrdao  is  a  CD-burning  application  which  has its own native TOC format to describe the disc layout.
       Although cdrdao has direct support for reading CUE files, it is currently limited to data tracks only. So
       <b>cue2toc</b>'s main usefulness lies in converting CUE files containing audio tracks.

       CUE files for audio discs often come with data files in compressed audio formats like MP3 or Ogg  Vorbis.
       To burn such a disc with cdrdao these files must be converted to WAVE or raw format.  <b>Cue2toc</b> can do this
       automatically if configured properly (see section <b>CONFIGURATION</b> below for more information).

       <b>Cue2toc</b>  normally  displays  warning messages for unsupported commands and constructs as well as for each
       data file converted. The <b>-q</b> option disables these messages.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b>     print debugging information

       <b>-h</b>     print a short help message

       <b>-o</b> <u>tocfile</u>
              write result to <u>tocfile</u> instead of standard ouput

       <b>-q</b>     quiet mode; do not print warnings

       <b>-v</b>     display version information

</pre><h4><b>CUE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       What follows is a description of the CUE format expected by  <b>cue2toc</b>.   For  information  about  the  TOC
       format please consult the <b><a href="../man1/cdrdao.1.html">cdrdao</a></b>(1) manual page.

       CUE  files  consist of commands and their arguments which must be separated from each other by any number
       of whitespace characters.  Space, horizontal tabulator, newline and carriage  return  are  recognized  as
       whitespace  characters  except  inside  strings  surrounded  by double quotes, where they are part of the
       string. Commands are not case sensitive. CD-Text data can be at most 80 characters per item.

       Timecode values are accepted in the forms "X:X:X", "X:X" and "X" where each "X" must consist of  at  most
       two  digits  and  may  be  zero  padded  to  the  left.  They  are  interpreted as "M:S:F", "S:F" and "F"
       respectively where "M" means "minutes" and must be in the range 0 &lt;= M &lt;= 99,  "S"  means  "seconds"  and
       must be in the range 0 &lt;= S &lt;= 59, and "F" means "frames" and must be in the range 0 &lt;= F &lt;= 74.

       CUE files are logically divided into a global section and one to 99 track sections. Inside these sections
       the following commands are allowed:

   <b>Global</b> <b>Section</b>
       <b>REM</b> <u>anything_to_newline</u>
       <b>CATALOG</b> <u>string</u>
       <b>CDTEXTFILE</b> <u>string</u>
       <b>TITLE</b> <u>string</u>
       <b>PERFORMER</b> <u>string</u>
       <b>SONGWRITER</b> <u>string</u>
       <b>FILE</b> <u>string</u> <b>BINARY</b>|<b>MOTOROLA</b>|<b>AIFF</b>|<b>WAVE</b>|<b>MP3</b>

       <b>REM</b>    Optional.   Introduces  a  comment.  Anything  from  there on up to and including the next newline
              character is ignored. Comments can appear anywhere in the file but not between a command  and  its
              arguments.

       <b>CATALOG</b>
              Optional.  The Media Catalog Number of the disc. Must be exactly 13 characters.

       <b>CDTEXTFILE</b>
              Optional.  Specifies an external file containing CD-Text data. Ignored.

       <b>TITLE</b>  Optional.  The CD-Text title of the disc.

       <b>PERFORMER</b>
              Optional.  The CD-Text performer of the disc.

       <b>SONGWRITER</b>
              Optional.  The CD-Text songwriter of the disc.

       <b>FILE</b>   Required.  The name and type of the file to be used for all following tracks.  The <u>string</u> contains
              the name of the file followed by one of <b>BINARY</b>, <b>MOTOROLA</b>, <b>AIFF</b>, <b>WAVE</b> or <b>MP3</b>.  As far as <b>cue2toc</b> is
              concerned  the  type of the file is effectively ignored.  Nonetheless <b>MOTOROLA</b>, <b>AIFF</b> and <b>MP3</b> cause
              printing of a warning message since these file types can not be used directly with cdrdao.

       The first appearance of a <b>TRACK</b> command causes leaving of the  global  section  and  entering  the  track
       section.

   <b>Track</b> <b>Section</b>
       <b>TRACK</b> <u>number</u> <u>mode</u>
       <b>REM</b> <u>anything_to_newline</u>
       <b>FLAGS</b> [<b>DCP</b>] [<b>4CH</b>] [<b>PRE</b>] [<b>SCMS</b>]
       <b>ISRC</b> <u>string</u>
       <b>TITLE</b> <u>string</u>
       <b>PERFORMER</b> <u>string</u>
       <b>SONGWRITER</b> <u>string</u>
       <b>PREGAP</b> <u>timecode</u>
       <b>INDEX</b> <u>number</u> <u>timecode</u>
       <b>POSTGAP</b> <u>timecode</u>
       <b>FILE</b> <u>string</u> <b>BINARY</b>|<b>MOTOROLA</b>|<b>AIFF</b>|<b>WAVE</b>|<b>MP3</b>

       <b>TRACK</b>  Required.   Starts  a  new track definition. The <u>number</u> is ignored. The <u>mode</u> must be one of <b>AUDIO</b>,
              <b>MODE1/2048</b>, <b>MODE1/2352</b>, <b>MODE2/2336</b> or <b>MODE2/2352</b>.

       <b>FLAGS</b>  Optional.  Defines the flags for this track. Must be followed by one  or  more  of  the  following
              commands:  <b>DCP</b>  (digital copy permitted), <b>4CH</b> (four channel audio), <b>PRE</b> (pre-emphasis enabled) and
              <b>SCMS</b> (serial copy management system).  <b>SCMS</b> is ignored because there is no corresponding option in
              the TOC format.

       <b>ISRC</b>   Optional.  The International Standard Recording Code for this track. Must be exactly 12 characters
              long.

       <b>TITLE</b>  Optional.  The CD-Text title of this track.

       <b>PERFORMER</b>
              Optional.  The CD-Text performer of this track.

       <b>SONWRITER</b>
              Optional.  The CD-Text songwriter of this track.

       <b>PREGAP</b> Optional.  The length of the track pregap to be filled with zero data.   Mutually  exclusive  with
              <b>INDEX</b> <b>0</b>.

       <b>POSTGAP</b>
              Optional.  The length of the track postgap to be filled with zero data.

       <b>INDEX</b>  Optional.   The  <u>number</u> must be in the range 0 &lt;= <u>number</u> &lt;= 99. Index number 1 specifies the start
              of the track. Index number 0 is the start of the track pregap filled with data from the file, i.e.
              the difference between index 0 and index 1 is the length  of  the  pregap.  Index  0  is  mutually
              exclusive with <b>PREGAP</b>.  Index numbers greater than 1 specify subindexes for this track and must be
              sequential.

       <b>FILE</b>   Optional  in  track  section. The syntax is the same as described above and if it appears inside a
              track specification it takes effect on the next <b>TRACK</b> command.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Cue2toc</b> can be configured by specifying options in the file <a href="file:~/.cue2tocrc.">~/.cue2tocrc.</a> The syntax  of  this  file  and
       allowed configuration options follow.

       Comments  are  introduced  by  the  hash  character  '#' and extend to the end of the line. Configuration
       options take the form

       OPTION = value

       The value must be quoted if it contains whitespace characters.  To include a double quote character in  a
       quoted  string,  precede it with a backslash. Option values can either be of boolean type or string type.
       For boolean types any one of "yes", "y", "true" or "1" means true and  anything  else  means  false.  The
       "default value"  in  the  descriptions of the individual options below is the value assumed by <b>cue2toc</b> in
       the absence of the option from the configuration file.

       <b>CONVERTER</b> <b>=</b> <u>ext_from</u> <u>ext_to</u> <u>command</u>
              This option takes three string arguments and specifies a converter for files  with  the  extension
              ext_from. They are converted by the given command and the extension is replaced with ext_to in the
              TOC  file.  When  the  command  is run the environment will contain the two variables C2T_FROM and
              C2T_TO which contain the original and new file name respectively. For example

              CONVERTER = .mp3 .wav
                   "lame --decode \"$C2T_FROM\" \"$C2T_TO\""

              will convert all MP3 files to WAVE format using lame. It is a good  idea  to  quote  the  varibles
              $C2T_FROM  and  $C2T_TO  because  they  could  contain whitespace or other funny characters with a
              special meaning to the shell.

              This option can be specified multiple  times  and  each  file  is  checked  against  the  list  of
              converters  to  see  if it matches any of them. If multiple converters match a given file only the
              first match is used.

              If a file with the name that results from replacing  ext_from  with  ext_to  already  exists,  the
              conversion command will not be executed.

              This option has no default value.

       <b>CONVERT</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              This  option enables or disables the conversion of data files as described above for the CONVERTER
              option.  If this option is false, no conversion will take place.  The default value is "yes".

       <b>QUIET</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              If this option is true it has the same effect as if <b>cue2toc</b> was invoked with the <b>-q</b>  command  line
              option. The default value is "no".

       <b>CDTEXT</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              This  option  enables  or disables the writing of CD-Text data to the TOC file if it is present in
              the CUE file.  The default value is "yes".

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The command <b>CDTEXTFILE</b> and the flag <b>SCMS</b> have no equivalent in the TOC format and are ignored.

       CUE files containing data tracks which specify a starting time greater than zero cannot be  converted  by
       <b>cue2toc</b>  because the TOC format does not provide a way to specify a starting time at all for data tracks.
       However if the CUE file does not contain any audio tracks you can try to use the CUE file  directly  with
       cdrdao.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="file:~/.cue2tocrc">~/.cue2tocrc</a>
              The configuration file. The format of this file is described in the section <b>CONFIGURATION</b> above.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="../man1/cdrdao.1.html">cdrdao</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/lame.1.html">lame</a></b>(1)

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Since  <b>cue2toc</b>'s  definition  of  the CUE format is entirely based on a number of different CUE files the
       author came across there is a very high probability that it will not work correctly with  all  the  other
       CUE  files  you  might  encounter. If this is the case for you please send the problematic CUE file along
       with the version number of <b>cue2toc</b> to &lt;<a href="mailto:dermatsch@gmx.de">dermatsch@gmx.de</a>&gt;.
