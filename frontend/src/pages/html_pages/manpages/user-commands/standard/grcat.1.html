</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       grcat - read from standard input, colourise it and write to standard output

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>grcat</b> <u>configuration</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>configuration</u>   is   a   name  of  a  configuration  file.  Directories  <a href="file:~/.grc/">~/.grc/</a>,  /usr/local/share/grc/,
       /usr/share/grc/ are searched for the file (in this order).

       If the file is not found, it is assumed to be an absolute path of a configuration file located elsewhere.

       Configuration file consists of entries, one per regexp, entries  are  separated  with  lines  with  first
       character non-alphanumeric (except #).  Lines beginning with # or empty lines are ignored.

       Each entry consists of several lines.  Each line has form: <u>keyword=value</u> where keyword is one of: <b>regexp</b>,
       <b>colours</b>,  <b>command</b>,  <b>concat</b>,  <b>skip</b>,  <b>count</b>.   Only <b>regexp</b> is mandatory, but it does not have much sense by
       itself unless you specify at least a <b>colour</b> or <b>command</b> keyword as well.

       <u>regexp</u> is the regular expression to match

       <u>colours</u> is the list of colours, separated by commas (you can specify only one colour),  each  colour  per
       one regexp group specified in regexp.

       <u>command</u>  is  command to be executed when regexp matches. Its output will be mixed with normal stdout, use
       redirectors ( &gt;/dev/null) if you want to supress it.

       <u>replace</u> means the regular expression match will be replaced by the  value,  all  the  preceeding  regular
       expressions  will  be  evaluated against the original text, all the following regular expressions will be
       evaluated against the replaced text

       <u>skip</u> can be either <b>yes</b>, or <b>no</b>, if yes, the matched line will be skipped  and  not  displayed  in  output.
       Default is no.

       <u>count</u> is one of words: <b>once</b>, <b>more</b>, or <b>stop</b>.

       <b>once</b>  means that if the regexp is matched, its first occurrence is coloured and the program will continue
       with other regexp's.

       <b>more</b> means that if there are multiple matches of the regexp in one line, all of them will be coloured.

       <b>stop</b> means that the regexp will be coloured and program will move to the next line (i.e.  ignoring  other
       regexp's)

       Regular  expressions  are  evaluated  from  top to bottom, this allows nested and overlapped expressions.
       (e.g. you colour everything inside parentheses with one colour, and if a following expression matches the
       text inside parentheses, it will be also coloured)
