</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cups - a standards-based, open source printing system

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>CUPS</b>  is  the  software  you  use  to  print from applications like word processors, email readers, photo
       editors, and web browsers. It converts  the  page  descriptions  produced  by  your  application  (put  a
       paragraph  here,  draw  a  line  there, and so forth) into something your printer can understand and then
       sends the information to the printer for printing.

       Now, since every printer manufacturer does things differently, printing can be  very  complicated.   <b>CUPS</b>
       does its best to hide this from you and your application so that you can concentrate on printing and less
       on how to print. Generally, the only time you need to know anything about your printer is when you use it
       for the first time, and even then <b>CUPS</b> can often figure things out on its own.

   <b>HOW</b> <b>DOES</b> <b>IT</b> <b>WORK?</b>
       The  first  time  you print to a printer, <b>CUPS</b> creates a queue to keep track of the current status of the
       printer (everything OK, out of paper, etc.) and any pages you have printed. Most of the  time  the  queue
       points  to  a  printer connected directly to your computer via a USB port, however it can also point to a
       printer on your network, a printer on the Internet, or multiple printers depending on the  configuration.
       Regardless of where the queue points, it will look like any other printer to you and your applications.

       Every time you print something, <b>CUPS</b> creates a job which contains the queue you are sending the print to,
       the name of the document you are printing, and the page descriptions. Job are numbered (queue-1, queue-2,
       and  so  forth)  so you can monitor the job as it is printed or cancel it if you see a mistake. When <b>CUPS</b>
       gets a job for printing, it determines the best programs (filters, printer drivers,  port  monitors,  and
       backends) to convert the pages into a printable format and then runs them to actually print the job.

       When  the  print job is completely printed, <b>CUPS</b> removes the job from the queue and moves on to any other
       jobs you have submitted. You can also be notified when the job is finished, or if there  are  any  errors
       during printing, in several different ways.

   <b>WHERE</b> <b>DO</b> <b>I</b> <b>BEGIN?</b>
       The   easiest   way  to  start  is  by  using  the  web  interface  to  configure  your  printer.  Go  to
       "<a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:631" and choose the Administration tab at the top of the page. Click/press on  the  Add
       Printer button and follow the prompts.

       When  you  are  asked  for  a username and password, enter your login username and password or the "root"
       username and password.

       After the printer is added you will be asked to set the default printer options (paper size, output mode,
       etc.) for the printer. Make any changes as needed and then click/press on the Set Default Options  button
       to  save  them.  Some  printers  also  support  auto-configuration - click/press on the Query Printer for
       Default Options button to update the options automatically.

       Once you have added the printer, you can print to it from any application. You can also choose Print Test
       Page from the maintenance menu to print a  simple  test  page  and  verify  that  everything  is  working
       properly.

       You  can  also  use  the  <b><a href="../man8/lpadmin.8.html">lpadmin</a></b>(8)  and <b><a href="../man8/lpinfo.8.html">lpinfo</a></b>(8) commands to add printers to <b>CUPS</b>.  Additionally, your
       operating system may include graphical user interfaces or automatically create printer  queues  when  you
       connect a printer to your computer.

   <b>HOW</b> <b>DO</b> <b>I</b> <b>GET</b> <b>HELP?</b>
       The <b>OpenPrinting</b> <b>CUPS</b> website (https://openprinting.github.io/cups) provides access to the <u>cups</u> and <u>cups-</u>
       <u>devel</u> mailing lists, additional documentation and resources, and a bug report database. Most vendors also
       provide online discussion forums to ask printing questions for your operating system of choice.
