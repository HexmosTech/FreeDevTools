</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       more — display files on a page-by-page basis

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       more <b>[</b>-ceisu<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-n <u>number</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b>-p <u>command</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b>-t <u>tagstring</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>file</u>...<b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>more</u> utility shall read files and either write them to the terminal on a page-by-page basis or filter
       them  to standard output. If standard output is not a terminal device, all input files shall be copied to
       standard output in their entirety, without modification, except  as  specified  for  the  <b>-s</b>  option.  If
       standard  output  is a terminal device, the files shall be written a number of lines (one screenful) at a
       time under the control of user commands. See the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.

       Certain block-mode terminals do not have all the capabilities necessary  to  support  the  complete  <u>more</u>
       definition;  they  are  incapable  of  accepting  commands  that  are  not  terminated  with a &lt;newline&gt;.
       Implementations that support such terminals shall provide an operating mode to <u>more</u> in which all commands
       can be terminated with a &lt;newline&gt; on those terminals. This mode:

        *  Shall be documented in the system documentation

        *  Shall, at invocation, inform the user of the terminal deficiency that requires  the  &lt;newline&gt;  usage
           and provide instructions on how this warning can be suppressed in future invocations

        *  Shall not be required for implementations supporting only fully capable terminals

        *  Shall not affect commands already requiring &lt;newline&gt; characters

        *  Shall  not  affect  users  on  the  capable  terminals from using <u>more</u> as described in this volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>more</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>12.2</u>,  <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>, except that <b>'+'</b> may be recognized as an option delimiter as well as <b>'-'</b>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-c</b>        If  a  screen  is to be written that has no lines in common with the current screen, or <u>more</u> is
                 writing its first screen, <u>more</u> shall not scroll the screen, but instead shall redraw each  line
                 of  the  screen  in  turn,  from  the  top of the screen to the bottom. In addition, if <u>more</u> is
                 writing its first screen, the screen shall be cleared. This option may be silently  ignored  on
                 devices with insufficient terminal capabilities.

       <b>-e</b>        Exit  immediately  after  writing  the last line of the last file in the argument list; see the
                 EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.

       <b>-i</b>        Perform pattern matching in searches without regard to case; see the Base Definitions volume of
                 POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>9.2</u>, <u>Regular</u> <u>Expression</u> <u>General</u> <u>Requirements</u>.

       <b>-n</b> <u>number</u> Specify the number of lines per screenful. The <u>number</u> argument is a positive  decimal  integer.
                 The <b>-n</b> option shall override any values obtained from any other source.

       <b>-p</b> <u>command</u>
                 Each  time  a screen from a new file is displayed or redisplayed (including as a result of <u>more</u>
                 commands; for example, <b>:p</b>), execute the <u>more</u> command(s) in the command arguments in  the  order
                 specified, as if entered by the user after the first screen has been displayed. No intermediate
                 results  shall  be  displayed (that is, if the command is a movement to a screen different from
                 the normal first screen, only the screen resulting from the command shall be displayed.) If any
                 of the commands fail for any reason, an informational message to this effect shall be  written,
                 and no further commands specified using the <b>-p</b> option shall be executed for this file.

       <b>-s</b>        Behave as if consecutive empty lines were a single empty line.

       <b>-t</b> <u>tagstring</u>
                 Write  the  screenful  of  the file containing the tag named by the <u>tagstring</u> argument. See the
                 <u>ctags</u> utility. The tags feature represented by <b>-t</b> <u>tagstring</u> and the <b>:t</b> command is optional.  It
                 shall  be  provided  on  any  system  that  also provides a conforming implementation of <u>ctags</u>;
                 otherwise, the use of <b>-t</b> produces undefined results.

                 The filename resulting from the <b>-t</b> option shall be logically added as a prefix to the  list  of
                 command  line files, as if specified by the user. If the tag named by the <u>tagstring</u> argument is
                 not found, it shall be an error, and <u>more</u> shall take no further action.

                 If the tag specifies a line number, the first line of the display shall contain  the  beginning
                 of  that  line. If the tag specifies a pattern, the first line of the display shall contain the
                 beginning of the matching text from the first line of the file that contains that  pattern.  If
                 the  line does not exist in the file or matching text is not found, an informational message to
                 this effect shall be displayed, and <u>more</u> shall display the default screen as if <b>-t</b> had not been
                 specified.

                 If both the <b>-t</b> <u>tagstring</u> and <b>-p</b> <u>command</u> options are given, the <b>-t</b> <u>tagstring</u> shall be  processed
                 first;  that  is,  the  file and starting line for the display shall be as specified by <b>-t</b>, and
                 then the <b>-p</b> <u>more</u> command shall be executed. If the line (matching text)  specified  by  the  <b>-t</b>
                 command  does  not  exist (is not found), no <b>-p</b> <u>more</u> command shall be executed for this file at
                 any time.

       <b>-u</b>        Treat a &lt;backspace&gt; as a printable control character, displayed  as  an  implementation-defined
                 character  sequence  (see  the  EXTENDED  DESCRIPTION section), suppressing backspacing and the
                 special handling that produces underlined or standout mode text on some terminal types.   Also,
                 do not ignore a &lt;carriage-return&gt; at the end of a line.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <u>file</u>      A  pathname  of  an  input file. If no <u>file</u> operands are specified, the standard input shall be
                 used. If a <u>file</u> is <b>'-'</b>, the standard input shall be read at that point in the sequence.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       The standard input shall be used only if no <u>file</u> operands are specified, or if a <u>file</u> operand is <b>'-'</b>.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The input files being examined shall be text files. If standard output  is  a  terminal,  standard  error
       shall  be  used  to  read commands from the user. If standard output is a terminal, standard error is not
       readable, and command input is needed, <u>more</u> may attempt to obtain  user  commands  from  the  controlling
       terminal  (for  example,  <b>/dev/tty</b>); otherwise, <u>more</u> shall terminate with an error indicating that it was
       unable to read user commands. If standard output is not a terminal, no error  shall  result  if  standard
       error cannot be opened for reading.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>more</u>:

       <u>COLUMNS</u>   Override  the  system-selected horizontal display line size. See the Base Definitions volume of
                 POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Chapter</u> <u>8</u>, <u>Environment</u> <u>Variables</u> for valid values and results when it is unset or
                 null.

       <u>EDITOR</u>    Used by the <b>v</b> command to select an editor. See the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u>  <u>Variables</u>  for  the
                 precedence   of   internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values  of  locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the  other  internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_COLLATE</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  for  the  behavior  of ranges, equivalence classes, and multi-character
                 collating elements within regular expressions.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files) and
                 the behavior of character classes within regular expressions.

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used  to affect the format and contents of diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error and informative messages written to standard output.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

       <u>LINES</u>     Override the system-selected vertical screen size, used as the number of lines in a  screenful.
                 See  the  Base  Definitions  volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Chapter</u> <u>8</u>, <u>Environment</u> <u>Variables</u> for valid
                 values and results when it is unset or null. The <b>-n</b> option shall take precedence over the <u>LINES</u>
                 variable for determining the number of lines in a screenful.

       <u>MORE</u>      Determine a string containing options described in the OPTIONS section preceded  with  &lt;hyphen-
                 minus&gt;  characters and &lt;blank&gt;-separated as on the command line. Any command line options shall
                 be processed after those in the <u>MORE</u> variable, as if the command line were:

                     more $MORE <u>options</u> <u>operands</u>

                 The <u>MORE</u> variable shall take precedence over the <u>TERM</u> and <u>LINES</u> variables for  determining  the
                 number of lines in a screenful.

       <u>TERM</u>      Determine  the  name  of  the  terminal type. If this variable is unset or null, an unspecified
                 default terminal type is used.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       The standard output shall be used to write the contents of the input files.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used for diagnostic messages and user commands (see the INPUT FILES section),
       and, if standard output is a terminal device, to write a prompting string.  The  prompting  string  shall
       appear  on the screen line below the last line of the file displayed in the current screenful. The prompt
       shall contain the name of the file currently being examined and shall contain an  end-of-file  indication
       and  the  name  of the next file, if any, when prompting at the end-of-file. If an error or informational
       message is displayed, it is unspecified whether it is contained in the prompt. If it is not contained  in
       the  prompt,  it  shall be displayed and then the user shall be prompted for a continuation character, at
       which point another message or the user prompt may be displayed. The prompt is otherwise unspecified.  It
       is unspecified whether informational messages are written for other user commands.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  section  describes the behavior of <u>more</u> when the standard output is a terminal device. If
       the standard output is not a terminal device, no options other than <b>-s</b> shall have  any  effect,  and  all
       input  files  shall  be  copied  to  standard  output otherwise unmodified, at which time <u>more</u> shall exit
       without further action.

       The number of lines available per screen shall be  determined  by  the  <b>-n</b>  option,  if  present,  or  by
       examining  values  in the environment (see the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section). If neither method yields a
       number, an unspecified number of lines shall be used.

       The maximum number of lines written shall be one less than this number, because the screen line after the
       last line written shall be used to write a user prompt and user input. If the  number  of  lines  in  the
       screen  is less than two, the results are undefined. It is unspecified whether user input is permitted to
       be longer than the remainder of the single line where the prompt has been written.

       The number of columns available per line shall be determined by examining values in the environment  (see
       the  ENVIRONMENT  VARIABLES section), with a default value as described in the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Chapter</u> <u>8</u>, <u>Environment</u> <u>Variables</u>.

       Lines that are longer than  the  display  shall  be  folded;  the  length  at  which  folding  occurs  is
       unspecified,  but should be appropriate for the output device. Folding may occur between glyphs of single
       characters that take up multiple display columns.

       When standard output is a terminal and <b>-u</b> is not specified, <u>more</u> shall treat &lt;backspace&gt;  and  &lt;carriage-
       return&gt; characters specially:

        *  A  character,  followed  first  by a sequence of <u>n</u> &lt;backspace&gt; characters (where <u>n</u> is the same as the
           number of column positions that the character occupies), then by  <u>n</u>  &lt;underscore&gt;  characters  (<b>'_'</b>),
           shall  cause that character to be written as underlined text, if the terminal type supports that. The
           <u>n</u> &lt;underscore&gt; characters, followed first by <u>n</u> &lt;backspace&gt; characters,  then  any  character  with  <u>n</u>
           column  positions,  shall also cause that character to be written as underlined text, if the terminal
           type supports that.

        *  A sequence of <u>n</u> &lt;backspace&gt; characters (where <u>n</u> is the same as the number of  column  positions  that
           the  previous character occupies) that appears between two identical printable characters shall cause
           the first of those two characters to be written as  emboldened  text  (that  is,  visually  brighter,
           standout  mode,  or  inverse-video  mode),  if  the terminal type supports that, and the second to be
           discarded. Immediately subsequent occurrences of &lt;backspace&gt;/character pairs for that same  character
           shall  also  be  discarded.  (For  example,  the  sequence  <b>"a\ba\ba\ba"</b>  is  interpreted as a single
           emboldened <b>'a'</b>.)

        *  The <u>more</u> utility shall logically discard all other &lt;backspace&gt; characters from the line  as  well  as
           the character which precedes them, if any.

        *  A  &lt;carriage-return&gt;  at  the  end  of  a  line shall be ignored, rather than being written as a non-
           printable character, as described in the next paragraph.

       It is implementation-defined how other non-printable characters are written. Implementations  should  use
       the same format that they use for the <u>ex</u> <b>print</b> command; see the OPTIONS section within the <u>ed</u> utility. It
       is unspecified whether a multi-column character shall be separated if it crosses a display line boundary;
       it  shall  not  be discarded. The behavior is unspecified if the number of columns on the display is less
       than the number of columns any single character in the line being displayed would occupy.

       When each new file is displayed (or redisplayed), <u>more</u> shall write the first screen of the file. Once the
       initial screen has been written, <u>more</u> shall prompt for a user command.  If  the  execution  of  the  user
       command  results  in  a  screen  that  has  lines  in  common with the current screen, and the device has
       sufficient terminal capabilities, <u>more</u> shall scroll the screen; otherwise, it is unspecified whether  the
       screen is scrolled or redrawn.

       For  all  files but the last (including standard input if no file was specified, and for the last file as
       well, if the <b>-e</b> option was not specified), when <u>more</u> has written the last line in the  file,  <u>more</u>  shall
       prompt  for  a user command. This prompt shall contain the name of the next file as well as an indication
       that <u>more</u> has reached end-of-file. If the user command is  <b>f</b>,  &lt;control&gt;‐F,  &lt;space&gt;,  <b>j</b>,  &lt;newline&gt;,  <b>d</b>,
       &lt;control&gt;‐D,  or  <b>s</b>, <u>more</u> shall display the next file. Otherwise, if displaying the last file, <u>more</u> shall
       exit. Otherwise, <u>more</u> shall execute the user command specified.

       Several of the commands described in this section display a previous screen from the input stream. In the
       case that text is being taken from a non-rewindable stream, such as a pipe, it is  implementation-defined
       how  much  backwards  motion  is  supported.  If  a command cannot be executed because of a limitation on
       backwards motion, an error message to this effect shall  be  displayed,  the  current  screen  shall  not
       change, and the user shall be prompted for another command.

       If  a  command  cannot be performed because there are insufficient lines to display, <u>more</u> shall alert the
       terminal. If a command cannot be performed because there are insufficient lines to display or a <b>/</b> command
       fails: if the input is the standard input, the last screen in the file may be displayed;  otherwise,  the
       current file and screen shall not change, and the user shall be prompted for another command.

       The  interactive commands in the following sections shall be supported.  Some commands can be preceded by
       a decimal integer, called <u>count</u> in the following descriptions. If not specified with the  command,  <u>count</u>
       shall default to 1. In the following descriptions, <u>pattern</u> is a basic regular expression, as described in
       the  Base  Definitions  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>9.3</u>,  <u>Basic</u>  <u>Regular</u>  <u>Expressions</u>.   The term
       ``examine'' is historical usage meaning ``open the file for viewing''; for example,  <u>more</u>  <b>foo</b>  would  be
       expressed as examining file <b>foo</b>.

       In the following descriptions, unless otherwise specified, <u>line</u> is a line in the <u>more</u> display, not a line
       from the file being examined.

       In the following descriptions, the <u>current</u> <u>position</u> refers to two things:

        1. The position of the current line on the screen

        2. The line number (in the file) of the current line on the screen

       Usually, the line on the screen corresponding to the current position is the third line on the screen. If
       this  is not possible (there are fewer than three lines to display or this is the first page of the file,
       or it is the last page of the file), then the current position is either the first or last  line  on  the
       screen as described later.

   <b>Help</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     h

       Write  a summary of these commands and other implementation-defined commands. The behavior shall be as if
       the <u>more</u> utility were executed with the <b>-e</b> option on a file that contained the summary  information.  The
       user  shall  be  prompted  as  described earlier in this section when end-of-file is reached. If the user
       command is one of those specified to continue to the next file, <u>more</u> shall return to the file and  screen
       state from which the <b>h</b> command was executed.

   <b>Examine</b> <b>New</b> <b>File</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     :e <b>[</b><u>filename</u><b>]</b>&lt;newline&gt;

       Examine  a  new  file.  If  the  <u>filename</u>  argument is not specified, the current file (see the <b>:n</b> and <b>:p</b>
       commands below) shall be re-examined. The <u>filename</u> shall be  subjected  to  the  process  of  shell  word
       expansions  (see  <u>Section</u>  <u>2.6</u>, <u>Word</u> <u>Expansions</u>); if more than a single pathname results, the effects are
       unspecified.  If <u>filename</u> is a &lt;number-sign&gt; (<b>'#'</b>), the previously examined file shall be re-examined. If
       <u>filename</u> is not accessible for any reason (including that it is a non-seekable file), an error message to
       this effect shall be displayed and the current file and screen shall not change.

   <b>Examine</b> <b>Next</b> <b>File</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     <b>[</b><u>count</u><b>]</b>:n

       Examine the next file. If a number <u>count</u> is specified, the  <u>count</u>th  next  file  shall  be  examined.  If
       <u>filename</u> refers to a non-seekable file, the results are unspecified.

   <b>Examine</b> <b>Previous</b> <b>File</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     <b>[</b><u>count</u><b>]</b>:p

       Examine  the  previous file. If a number <u>count</u> is specified, the <u>count</u>th previous file shall be examined.
       If <u>filename</u> refers to a non-seekable file, the results are unspecified.

   <b>Go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tag</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     :t <u>tagstring</u>&lt;newline&gt;

       If the file containing the tag named by the <u>tagstring</u> argument is not the current file, examine the file,
       as if the <b>:e</b> command was executed with that file as the argument. Otherwise, or in addition, display  the
       screenful  beginning with the tag, as described for the <b>-t</b> option (see the OPTIONS section). If the <u>ctags</u>
       utility is not supported by the system, the use of <b>:t</b> produces undefined results.

   <b>Invoke</b> <b>Editor</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     v

       Invoke an editor to edit the current file being examined.  If  standard  input  is  being  examined,  the
       results  are  unspecified. The name of the editor shall be taken from the environment variable <u>EDITOR</u>, or
       shall default to <u>vi</u>.  If the last pathname component in <u>EDITOR</u> is either <u>vi</u> or <u>ex</u>, the  editor  shall  be
       invoked  with a <b>-c</b> <u>linenumber</u> command line argument, where <u>linenumber</u> is the line number of the file line
       containing the display line currently displayed as the first line of the screen.  It  is  implementation-
       defined whether line-setting options are passed to editors other than <u>vi</u> and <u>ex</u>.

       When the editor exits, <u>more</u> shall resume with the same file and screen as when the editor was invoked.

   <b>Display</b> <b>Position</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     =
                     &lt;control&gt;-G

       Write  a  message  for which the information references the first byte of the line after the last line of
       the file on the screen. This message shall include the name of the file  currently  being  examined,  its
       number  relative to the total number of files there are to examine, the line number in the file, the byte
       number and the total bytes in the file, and what percentage of the file precedes the current position. If
       <u>more</u> is reading from standard input, or the file is shorter than a single screen, the  line  number,  the
       byte number, the total bytes, and the percentage need not be written.

   <b>Quit</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     q
                     :q
                     ZZ

       Exit <u>more</u>.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       If  an error is encountered accessing a file when using the <b>:n</b> command, <u>more</u> shall attempt to examine the
       next file in the argument list, but the final exit status shall be affected. If an error  is  encountered
       accessing  a  file  via  the  <b>:p</b> command, <u>more</u> shall attempt to examine the previous file in the argument
       list, but the final exit status shall be affected. If an error is encountered accessing a file via the <b>:e</b>
       command, <u>more</u> shall remain in the current file and the final exit status shall not be affected.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       When the standard output is not a terminal, only the <b>-s</b> filter-modification option is effective. This  is
       based  on historical practice. For example, a typical implementation of <u>man</u> pipes its output through <u>more</u>
       <b>-s</b> to squeeze excess white space for terminal users. When <u>man</u> is piped to <u>lp</u>, however, it is  undesirable
       for this squeezing to happen.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>-p</b> allows arbitrary commands to be executed at the start of each file.  Examples are:

       <u>more</u> <b>-p</b> <b>G</b> <u>file1</u> <u>file2</u>
             Examine each file starting with its last screenful.

       <u>more</u> <b>-p</b> 100 <u>file1</u> <u>file2</u>
             Examine  each  file starting with line 100 in the current position (usually the third line, so line
             98 would be the first line written).

       <u>more</u> <b>-p</b> /100 <u>file1</u> <u>file2</u>
             Examine each file starting with the first line containing the string <b>"100"</b> in the current position

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>more</u> utility, available in BSD and BSD-derived systems, was chosen as the  prototype  for  the  POSIX
       file display program since it is more widely available than either the public-domain program <u>less</u> or than
       <u>pg</u>,  a  pager provided in System V. The 4.4 BSD <u>more</u> is the model for the features selected; it is almost
       fully upwards-compatible from the 4.3 BSD version in wide use and has become more amenable for <u>vi</u>  users.
       Several features originally derived from various file editors, found in both <u>less</u> and <u>pg</u>, have been added
       to this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 as they have proved extremely popular with users.

       There  are  inconsistencies  between  <u>more</u>  and <u>vi</u> that result from historical practice. For example, the
       single-character commands <b>h</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>b</b>, and &lt;space&gt; are screen movers in <u>more</u>, but cursor movers in <u>vi</u>.  These
       inconsistencies were maintained because the cursor movements are not applicable to <u>more</u> and the  powerful
       functionality achieved without the use of the control key justifies the differences.

       The  tags  interface has been included in a program that is not a text editor because it promotes another
       degree of consistent operation with <u>vi</u>.  It is conceivable that the paging environment of <u>more</u>  would  be
       superior for browsing source code files in some circumstances.

       The  operating  mode  referred  to for block-mode terminals effectively adds a &lt;newline&gt; to each Synopsis
       line that currently has none. So, for example, <b>d</b>&lt;newline&gt; would page one screenful.  The  mode  could  be
       triggered  by  a  command  line  option,  environment variable, or some other method. The details are not
       imposed by this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 because there are so few systems known to support such  terminals.
       Nevertheless, it was considered that all systems should be able to support <u>more</u> given the exception cited
       for  this small community of terminals because, in comparison to <u>vi</u>, the cursor movements are few and the
       command set relatively amenable to the optional &lt;newline&gt; characters.

       Some versions of <u>more</u> provide a shell escaping mechanism similar to  the  <u>ex</u>  <b>!</b>   command.  The  standard
       developers  did  not  consider  that  this  was  necessary  in  a  paginator, particularly given the wide
       acceptance of multiple window terminals and job control features. (They chose to retain such features  in
       the  editors  and  <u>mailx</u>  because  the  shell interaction also gives an opportunity to modify the editing
       buffer, which is not applicable to <u>more</u>.)

       The <b>-p</b> (position) option replaces the <b>+</b> command because of the Utility Syntax  Guidelines.  The  <b>+</b><u>command</u>
       option  is  no  longer  specified  by  POSIX.1‐2008  but may be present in some implementations. In early
       proposals, it took a <u>pattern</u> argument, but historical <u>less</u>  provided  the  <u>more</u>  general  facility  of  a
       command. It would have been desirable to use the same <b>-c</b> as <u>ex</u> and <u>vi</u>, but the letter was already in use.

       The  text  stating  ``from  a non-rewindable stream ... implementations may limit the amount of backwards
       motion supported'' would allow an implementation that permitted no backwards motion beyond  text  already
       on  the  screen.  It  was  not  possible  to  require  a minimum amount of backwards motion that would be
       effective for all conceivable device types. The implementation should allow the user to back up as far as
       possible, within device and reasonable memory allocation constraints.

       Historically, non-printable characters were displayed using the ARPA  standard  mappings,  which  are  as
       follows:

        1. Printable characters are left alone.

        2. Control  characters  less  than \177 are represented as followed by the character offset from the <b>'@'</b>
           character in the ASCII map; for example, \007 is represented as <b>'G'</b>.

        3. \177 is represented as followed by <b>'?'</b>.

       The display of characters having their eighth bit set was less standard. Existing implementations use hex
       (0x00), octal (\000), and a meta-bit display. (The latter displayed characters with their eighth bit  set
       as  the  two  characters  <b>"M-"</b>,  followed  by  the seven-bit display as described previously.) The latter
       probably has the best claim to historical practice because it was used with the <b>-v</b> option of 4 BSD and  4
       BSD-derived versions of the <u>cat</u> utility since 1980.

       No  specific  display  format  is  required by POSIX.1‐2008. Implementations are encouraged to conform to
       historic practice in the absence of any strong reason to diverge.
