</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       c99 — compile standard C programs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       c99 <b>[</b><u>options</u>...<b>]</b> <u>pathname</u> <b>[[</b><u>pathname</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b>-I <u>directory</u><b>]</b>
           <b>[</b>-L <u>directory</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b>-l <u>library</u><b>]]</b>...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>c99</u>  utility  is  an  interface  to  the  standard C compilation system; it shall accept source code
       conforming to the ISO C standard. The system conceptually consists of a compiler  and  link  editor.  The
       input  files  referenced  by  <u>pathname</u>  operands  and <b>-l</b> option-arguments shall be compiled and linked to
       produce an executable file. (It is unspecified whether the linking occurs entirely within  the  operation
       of <u>c99</u>; some implementations may produce objects that are not fully resolved until the file is executed.)

       If the <b>-c</b> option is specified, for all pathname operands of the form <u>file</u><b>.c</b>, the files:

           $(basename <u>pathname</u> .c).o

       shall  be  created  as  the  result  of  successful compilation. If the <b>-c</b> option is not specified, it is
       unspecified whether such <b>.o</b> files are created or deleted for the <u>file</u><b>.c</b> operands.

       If there are no options that prevent link editing (such as <b>-c</b> or <b>-E</b>), and all  input  files  compile  and
       link without error, the resulting executable file shall be written according to the <b>-o</b> <u>outfile</u> option (if
       present) or to the file <b>a.out</b>.

       The  executable  file  shall  be created as specified in <u>Section</u> <u>1.1.1.4</u>, <u>File</u> <u>Read</u>, <u>Write</u>, <u>and</u> <u>Creation</u>,
       except that the file permission bits shall be set to: S_IRWXO | S_IRWXG | S_IRWXU

       and the bits specified by the <u>umask</u> of the process shall be cleared.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>c99</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>12.2</u>,  <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>, except that:

        *  Options can be interspersed with operands.

        *  The order of specifying the <b>-L</b> and <b>-l</b> options, and the order of specifying <b>-l</b> options with respect to
           <u>pathname</u> operands is significant.

        *  Conforming  applications  shall specify each option separately; that is, grouping option letters (for
           example, <b>-cO</b>) need not be recognized by all implementations.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-c</b>        Suppress the link-edit phase of the compilation, and do not remove any object  files  that  are
                 produced.

       <b>-D</b> <u>name</u><b>[=</b><u>value</u><b>]</b>
                 Define  <u>name</u> as if by a C-language <b>#define</b> directive. If no =<u>value</u> is given, a value of 1 shall
                 be used. The <b>-D</b> option has lower precedence than the <b>-U</b> option. That is, if  <u>name</u>  is  used  in
                 both  a  <b>-U</b>  and  a  <b>-D</b> option, <u>name</u> shall be undefined regardless of the order of the options.
                 Additional implementation-defined <u>name</u>s may be provided by the compiler. Implementations  shall
                 support at least 2048 bytes of <b>-D</b> definitions and 256 <u>names</u>.

       <b>-E</b>        Copy  C-language  source  files  to  standard output, executing all preprocessor directives; no
                 compilation shall be performed. If any operand is not a text file, the effects are unspecified.

       <b>-g</b>        Produce symbolic information in the object or executable files; the nature of this  information
                 is unspecified, and may be modified by implementation-defined interactions with other options.

       <b>-I</b> <u>directory</u>
                 Change  the  algorithm for searching for headers whose names are not absolute pathnames to look
                 in the directory named by the <u>directory</u> pathname before looking  in  the  usual  places.  Thus,
                 headers  whose  names  are  enclosed  in  double-quotes (<b>""</b>) shall be searched for first in the
                 directory of the file with the <b>#include</b> line, then in directories named in <b>-I</b> options, and last
                 in the usual places. For headers whose names are enclosed in angle brackets (<b>"&lt;&gt;"</b>), the  header
                 shall  be  searched  for  only in directories named in <b>-I</b> options and then in the usual places.
                 Directories named in <b>-I</b> options shall be searched in the order specified. If the <b>-I</b>  option  is
                 used  to  specify  a directory that is one of the usual places searched by default, the results
                 are unspecified. Implementations shall support at least ten  instances  of  this  option  in  a
                 single <u>c99</u> command invocation.

       <b>-L</b> <u>directory</u>
                 Change  the  algorithm  of  searching  for the libraries named in the <b>-l</b> objects to look in the
                 directory named by the <u>directory</u> pathname before looking in the usual places. Directories named
                 in <b>-L</b> options shall be searched in the order specified. If the <b>-L</b> option is used to  specify  a
                 directory  that  is  one  of the usual places searched by default, the results are unspecified.
                 Implementations shall support at least ten instances of this option in  a  single  <u>c99</u>  command
                 invocation. If a directory specified by a <b>-L</b> option contains files with names starting with any
                 of  the strings <b>"libc."</b>, <b>"libl."</b>, <b>"libpthread."</b>, <b>"libm."</b>, <b>"librt."</b>, <b>"libtrace."</b>, <b>"libxnet."</b>, or
                 <b>"liby."</b>, the results are unspecified.

       <b>-l</b> <u>library</u>
                 Search the library  named  <b>liblibrary.a</b>.   A  library  shall  be  searched  when  its  name  is
                 encountered,  so the placement of a <b>-l</b> option is significant. Several standard libraries can be
                 specified in this manner, as described in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section. Implementations may
                 recognize implementation-defined suffixes other than <b>.a</b> as denoting libraries.

       <b>-O</b> <u>optlevel</u>
                 Specify the level of code optimization. If the <u>optlevel</u> option-argument is the digit  <b>'0'</b>,  all
                 special  code  optimizations  shall  be  disabled.  If  it  is the digit <b>'1'</b>, the nature of the
                 optimization is unspecified. If the <b>-O</b> option is omitted, the nature of  the  system's  default
                 optimization is unspecified. It is unspecified whether code generated in the presence of the <b>-O</b>
                 0  option  is  the  same  as  that  generated  when <b>-O</b> is omitted. Other <u>optlevel</u> values may be
                 supported.

       <b>-o</b> <u>outfile</u>
                 Use the pathname <u>outfile</u>, instead of the default <b>a.out</b>, for the executable  file  produced.  If
                 the <b>-o</b> option is present with <b>-c</b> or <b>-E</b>, the result is unspecified.

       <b>-s</b>        Produce  object  or  executable  files,  or both, from which symbolic and other information not
                 required for proper execution using the <u>exec</u> family defined in the System Interfaces volume  of
                 POSIX.1‐2017  has  been  removed  (stripped). If both <b>-g</b> and <b>-s</b> options are present, the action
                 taken is unspecified.

       <b>-U</b> <u>name</u>   Remove any initial definition of <u>name</u>.

       Multiple instances of the <b>-D</b>, <b>-I</b>, <b>-L</b>, <b>-l</b>, and <b>-U</b> options can be specified.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The application shall ensure that at least one <u>pathname</u> operand is specified.  The  following  forms  for
       <u>pathname</u> operands shall be supported:

       <u>file.</u><b>c</b>    A  C-language  source  file  to be compiled and optionally linked. The application shall ensure
                 that the operand is of this form if the <b>-c</b> option is used.

       <u>file.</u><b>a</b>    A library of object files typically produced by the <u>ar</u> utility, and passed directly to the link
                 editor. Implementations may recognize implementation-defined suffixes other than <b>.a</b> as denoting
                 object file libraries.

       <u>file.</u><b>o</b>    An object file produced by <u>c99</u> <b>-c</b> and passed directly to the link editor.  Implementations  may
                 recognize implementation-defined suffixes other than <b>.o</b> as denoting object files.

       The processing of other files is implementation-defined.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Each  input  file  shall  be one of the following: a text file containing a C-language source program, an
       object file in the format produced by <u>c99</u> <b>-c</b>, or a library of object files, in  the  format  produced  by
       archiving  zero  or  more  object  files, using <u>ar</u>.  Implementations may supply additional utilities that
       produce files in these formats. Additional input file formats are implementation-defined.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>c99</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u>  <u>Variables</u>  for  the
                 precedence   of   internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values  of  locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the  other  internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine  the  locale  for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to  affect  the  format  and  contents  of  diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

       <u>TMPDIR</u>    Provide  a pathname that should override the default directory for temporary files, if any.  On
                 XSI-conforming systems, provide a pathname  that  shall  override  the  default  directory  for
                 temporary files, if any.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       If  more  than  one  <u>pathname</u> operand ending in <b>.c</b> (or possibly other unspecified suffixes) is given, for
       each such file:

           "%s:\n", &lt;<u>pathname</u>&gt;

       may be written. These messages, if written, shall precede the processing of each input file;  they  shall
       not  be  written  to  the  standard output if they are written to the standard error, as described in the
       STDERR section.

       If the <b>-E</b> option is specified, the standard output shall be a text file that represents  the  results  of
       the  preprocessing  stage  of  the  language; it may contain extra information appropriate for subsequent
       compilation passes.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.  If more than one <u>pathname</u> operand  ending
       in <b>.c</b> (or possibly other unspecified suffixes) is given, for each such file:

           "%s:\n", &lt;<u>pathname</u>&gt;

       may  be written to allow identification of the diagnostic and warning messages with the appropriate input
       file. These messages, if written, shall precede the processing of each input  file;  they  shall  not  be
       written  to  the  standard  error  if they are written to the standard output, as described in the STDOUT
       section.

       This utility may produce warning messages about certain conditions that do not warrant returning an error
       (non-zero) exit value.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Object files or executable files or both are produced in unspecified  formats.  If  the  pathname  of  an
       object  file  or  executable file to be created by <u>c99</u> resolves to an existing directory entry for a file
       that is not a regular file, it is unspecified whether <u>c99</u> shall attempt to create the file or shall issue
       a diagnostic and exit with a non-zero exit status.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Standard</b> <b>Libraries</b>
       The <u>c99</u> utility shall recognize the following <b>-l</b> options for standard libraries:

       <b>-l</b> <b>c</b>      This option shall make available all interfaces referenced in the System Interfaces  volume  of
                 POSIX.1‐2017,  with  the  possible exception of those interfaces listed as residing in <u>&lt;aio.h&gt;</u>,
                 <u>&lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;</u>,   <u>&lt;complex.h&gt;</u>,   <u>&lt;fenv.h&gt;</u>,   <u>&lt;math.h&gt;</u>,   <u>&lt;mqueue.h&gt;</u>,   <u>&lt;netdb.h&gt;</u>,    <u>&lt;net/if.h&gt;</u>,
                 <u>&lt;netinet/in.h&gt;</u>,    <u>&lt;pthread.h&gt;</u>,    <u>&lt;sched.h&gt;</u>,    <u>&lt;semaphore.h&gt;</u>,    <u>&lt;spawn.h&gt;</u>,   <u>&lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</u>,
                 <u>pthread_kill</u>(), and <u>pthread_sigmask</u>() in <u>&lt;signal.h&gt;</u>, <u>&lt;trace.h&gt;</u>, interfaces marked  as  optional
                 in  <u>&lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</u>,  interfaces marked as ADV (Advisory Information) in <u>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</u>, and interfaces
                 beginning with the prefix clock_ or timer_ in <u>&lt;time.h&gt;</u>.  This option shall not be  required  to
                 be present to cause a search of this library.

       <b>-l</b> <b>l</b>      This  option  shall make available all interfaces required by the C-language output of <u>lex</u> that
                 are not made available through the <b>-l</b> <b>c</b> option.

       <b>-l</b> <b>pthread</b>
                 This option shall make available all interfaces referenced in  <u>&lt;pthread.h&gt;</u>  and  <u>pthread_kill</u>()
                 and  <u>pthread_sigmask</u>()  referenced in <u>&lt;signal.h&gt;</u>.  An implementation may search this library in
                 the absence of this option.

       <b>-l</b> <b>m</b>      This option shall make available  all  interfaces  referenced  in  <u>&lt;math.h&gt;</u>,  <u>&lt;complex.h&gt;</u>,  and
                 <u>&lt;fenv.h&gt;</u>.  An implementation may search this library in the absence of this option.

       <b>-l</b> <b>rt</b>     This  option  shall make available all interfaces referenced in <u>&lt;aio.h&gt;</u>, <u>&lt;mqueue.h&gt;</u>, <u>&lt;sched.h&gt;</u>,
                 <u>&lt;semaphore.h&gt;</u>, and <u>&lt;spawn.h&gt;</u>, interfaces marked as optional in <u>&lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</u>, interfaces  marked
                 as ADV (Advisory Information) in <u>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</u>, and interfaces beginning with the prefix clock_ and
                 timer_ in <u>&lt;time.h&gt;</u>.  An implementation may search this library in the absence of this option.

       <b>-l</b> <b>trace</b>  This option shall make available all interfaces referenced in <u>&lt;trace.h&gt;</u>.  An implementation may
                 search this library in the absence of this option.

       <b>-l</b> <b>xnet</b>   This  option  shall  make  available  all  interfaces  referenced  in <u>&lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;</u>, <u>&lt;netdb.h&gt;</u>,
                 <u>&lt;net/if.h&gt;</u>, <u>&lt;netinet/in.h&gt;</u>, and <u>&lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</u>.  An implementation may search this  library  in
                 the absence of this option.

       <b>-l</b> <b>y</b>      This  option shall make available all interfaces required by the C-language output of <u>yacc</u> that
                 are not made available through the <b>-l</b> <b>c</b> option.

       In the absence of options that inhibit invocation of the link editor, such as <b>-c</b> or <b>-E</b>, the  <u>c99</u>  utility
       shall  cause  the  equivalent  of  a  <b>-l</b> <b>c</b> option to be passed to the link editor after the last <u>pathname</u>
       operand or <b>-l</b> option, causing it to be searched after all other object files and libraries are loaded.

       It is unspecified whether the  libraries  <b>libc.a</b>,  <b>libl.a</b>,  <b>libm.a</b>,  <b>libpthread.a</b>,  <b>librt.a</b>,  <b>libtrace.a</b>,
       <b>libxnet.a</b>,  or  <b>liby.a</b> exist as regular files. The implementation may accept as <b>-l</b> option-arguments names
       of objects that do not exist as regular files.

   <b>External</b> <b>Symbols</b>
       The C compiler and link editor shall support the significance of external symbols up to a  length  of  at
       least  31  bytes; the action taken upon encountering symbols exceeding the implementation-defined maximum
       symbol length is unspecified.

       The compiler and link editor shall support a minimum of 511 external symbols per source or  object  file,
       and  a  minimum  of 4095 external symbols in total. A diagnostic message shall be written to the standard
       output if the implementation-defined limit is exceeded; other actions are unspecified.

   <b>Header</b> <b>Search</b>
       If a file with the same name as one of the standard headers defined in the  Base  Definitions  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Chapter</u>  <u>13</u>,  <u>Headers</u>, not provided as part of the implementation, is placed in any of the
       usual places that are searched by default for headers, the results are unspecified.

   <b>Programming</b> <b>Environments</b>
       All  implementations  shall  support  one  of  the  following  programming  environments  as  a  default.
       Implementations may support more than one of the following programming environments. Applications can use
       <u>sysconf</u>() or <u>getconf</u> to determine which programming environments are supported.

       The  executable  files  created  when  these  environments  are  selected shall be in a proper format for
       execution by the <u>exec</u> family of functions. Each environment  may  be  one  of  the  ones  in  <u>Table</u>  <u>4-4,</u>
       <u>Programming</u>  <u>Environments:</u>  <u>Type</u>  <u>Sizes</u>, or it may be another environment. The names for the environments
       that meet this requirement shall be output by a <u>getconf</u> command using the  POSIX_V7_WIDTH_RESTRICTED_ENVS
       argument,  as  a  &lt;newline&gt;-separated  list of names suitable for use with the <u>getconf</u> <b>-v</b> option. If more
       than one environment meets the requirement, the names  of  all  such  environments  shall  be  output  on
       separate  lines.  Any of these names can then be used in a subsequent <u>getconf</u> command to obtain the flags
       specific to that environment with the following suffixes added as appropriate:

       _CFLAGS   To get the C compiler flags.

       _LDFLAGS  To get the linker/loader flags.

       _LIBS     To get the libraries.

       This requirement may be removed in a future version.

       When this utility processes a file containing a function called <u>main</u>(), it shall be defined with a return
       type equivalent to <b>int</b>.  Using return from the initial call to <u>main</u>() shall  be  equivalent  (other  than
       with respect to language scope issues) to calling <u>exit</u>() with the returned value. Reaching the end of the
       initial  call  to  <u>main</u>() shall be equivalent to calling <u><a href="../man0/exit.0.html">exit</a></u>(0).  The implementation shall not declare a
       prototype for this function.

       Implementations provide configuration strings for C compiler flags, linker/loader  flags,  and  libraries
       for  each  supported  environment.   When  an application needs to use a specific programming environment
       rather than the implementation default programming environment while  compiling,  the  application  shall
       first  verify  that  the  implementation  supports  the  desired  environment. If the desired programming
       environment is supported, the application shall then invoke <u>c99</u> with the appropriate C compiler flags  as
       the  first options for the compile, the appropriate linker/loader flags after any other options except <b>-l</b>
       but before any operands or <b>-l</b> options, and the appropriate libraries at the end of the  operands  and  <b>-l</b>
       options.

       Conforming  applications  shall  not  attempt  to  link  together  object  files  compiled  for different
       programming models. Applications shall also be aware that binary data placed in shared memory or in files
       might not be recognized by applications built for other programming models.

       In addition to the type size programming environments above, all implementations also  support  a  multi-
       threaded  programming environment that is orthogonal to all of the programming environments listed above.

       These  programming  environment  flags  may  be used in conjunction with any of the type size programming
       environments supported by the implementation.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful compilation or link edit.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       When <u>c99</u> encounters a compilation error that causes an object file not to be created, it  shall  write  a
       diagnostic to standard error and continue to compile other source code operands, but it shall not perform
       the link phase and it shall return a non-zero exit status. If the link edit is unsuccessful, a diagnostic
       message shall be written to standard error and <u>c99</u> exits with a non-zero status. A conforming application
       shall rely on the exit status of <u>c99</u>, rather than on the existence or mode of the executable file.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Since  the  <u>c99</u> utility usually creates files in the current directory during the compilation process, it
       is typically necessary to run the <u>c99</u> utility in a directory in which a file can be created.

       On systems providing POSIX Conformance (see the Base  Definitions  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Chapter</u>  <u>2</u>,
       <u>Conformance</u>),  <u>c99</u> is required only with the C-Language Development option; XSI-conformant systems always
       provide <u>c99</u>.

       Some historical implementations have created <b>.o</b> files when <b>-c</b> is not specified and more than  one  source
       file  is  given.  Since  this  area  is  left  unspecified, the application cannot rely on <b>.o</b> files being
       created, but it also must be prepared for any related <b>.o</b> files that already exist being  deleted  at  the
       completion of the link edit.

       There is the possible implication that if a user supplies versions of the standard functions (before they
       would be encountered by an implicit <b>-l</b> <b>c</b> or explicit <b>-l</b> <b>m</b>), that those versions would be used in place of
       the  standard  versions.   There are various reasons this might not be true (functions defined as macros,
       manipulations for clean name space, and so on), so the existence of files named in the same manner as the
       standard libraries within the <b>-L</b> directories is explicitly stated to produce unspecified behavior.

       All of the functions specified in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 may  be  made  visible  by
       implementations  when the Standard C Library is searched. Conforming applications must explicitly request
       searching the other standard libraries when functions made visible by those libraries are used.

       In the ISO C standard the mapping from physical source characters  to  the  C  source  character  set  is
       implementation-defined. Implementations may strip white-space characters before the terminating &lt;newline&gt;
       of  a  (physical)  line  as  part  of this mapping and, as a consequence of this, one or more white-space
       characters (and no other characters) between a &lt;backslash&gt; character and  the  &lt;newline&gt;  character  that
       terminates  the  line  produces implementation-defined results. Portable applications should not use such
       constructs.

       Some <u>c99</u> compilers not conforming to POSIX.1‐2008 do not support trigraphs by default.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
        1. The following usage example compiles <b>foo.c</b> and creates the executable file <b>foo</b>:

               c99 -o foo foo.c

           The following usage example compiles <b>foo.c</b> and creates the object file <b>foo.o</b>:

               c99 -c foo.c

           The following usage example compiles <b>foo.c</b> and creates the executable file <b>a.out</b>:

               c99 foo.c

           The following usage example compiles <b>foo.c</b>, links it with <b>bar.o</b>,  and  creates  the  executable  file
           <b>a.out</b>.  It may also create and leave <b>foo.o</b>:

               c99 foo.c bar.o

        2. The  following  example shows how an application using threads interfaces can test for support of and
           use a programming environment supporting 32-bit <b>int</b>, <b>long</b>, and <b>pointer</b> types and an <b>off_t</b> type  using
           at least 64 bits:

               offbig_env=$(getconf _POSIX_V7_ILP32_OFFBIG)
               if [ $offbig_env != "-1" ] &amp;&amp; [ $offbig_env != "undefined" ]
               then
                   c99 $(getconf POSIX_V7_ILP32_OFFBIG_CFLAGS) \
                   $(getconf POSIX_V7_THREADS_CFLAGS) -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=700 \
                   $(getconf POSIX_V7_ILP32_OFFBIG_LDFLAGS) \
                   $(getconf POSIX_V7_THREADS_LDFLAGS) foo.c -o foo \
                   $(getconf POSIX_V7_ILP32_OFFBIG_LIBS) \
                   -l pthread
               else
                   echo ILP32_OFFBIG programming environment not supported
                   exit 1
               fi

        3. The following examples clarify the use and interactions of <b>-L</b> and <b>-l</b> options.

           Consider  the  case  in  which  module <b>a.c</b> calls function <u>f</u>() in library <b>libQ.a</b>, and module <b>b.c</b> calls
           function <u>g</u>() in library <b>libp.a</b>.  Assume that both libraries reside in <b>/a/b/c</b>.  The  command  line  to
           compile and link in the desired way is:

               c99 -L /a/b/c main.o a.c -l Q b.c -l p

           In this case the <b>-L</b> option need only precede the first <b>-l</b> option, since both <b>libQ.a</b> and <b>libp.a</b> reside
           in the same directory.

           Multiple <b>-L</b> options can be used when library name collisions occur. Building on the previous example,
           suppose that the user wants to use a new <b>libp.a</b>, in <b>/a/a/a</b>, but still wants <u>f</u>() from <b>/a/b/c/libQ.a</b>:

               c99 -L /a/a/a -L /a/b/c main.o a.c -l Q b.c -l p

           In  this  example, the linker searches the <b>-L</b> options in the order specified, and finds <b>/a/a/a/libp.a</b>
           before <b>/a/b/c/libp.a</b> when resolving references for <b>b.c</b>.   The  order  of  the  <b>-l</b>  options  is  still
           important, however.

        4. The  following example shows how an application can use a programming environment where the widths of
           the following types: <b>blksize_t</b>, <b>cc_t</b>, <b>mode_t</b>, <b>nfds_t</b>, <b>pid_t</b>,  <b>ptrdiff_t</b>,  <b>size_t</b>,  <b>speed_t</b>,  <b>ssize_t</b>,
           <b>suseconds_t</b>, <b>tcflag_t</b>, <b>wchar_t</b>, <b>wint_t</b>

           are no greater than the width of type <b>long</b>:

               # First choose one of the listed environments ...

               # ... if there are no additional constraints, the first one will do:
               CENV=$(getconf POSIX_V7_WIDTH_RESTRICTED_ENVS | head -n l)

               # ... or, if an environment that supports large files is preferred,
               # look for names that contain "OFF64" or "OFFBIG". (This chooses
               # the last one in the list if none match.)
               for CENV in $(getconf POSIX_V7_WIDTH_RESTRICTED_ENVS)
               do
                   case $CENV in
                   *OFF64*|*OFFBIG*) break ;;
                   esac
               done

               # The chosen environment name can now be used like this:

               c99 $(getconf ${CENV}_CFLAGS) -D _POSIX_C_SOURCE=200809L \
               $(getconf ${CENV}_LDFLAGS) foo.c -o foo \
               $(getconf ${CENV}_LIBS)

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>c99</u> utility is based on the <u>c89</u> utility originally introduced in the ISO POSIX‐2:1993 standard.

       Some  of  the  changes  from  <u>c89</u> include the ability to intersperse options and operands (which many <u>c89</u>
       implementations allowed despite it not being specified), the description of <b>-l</b> as an option instead of an
       operand, and the modification to the contents of the  Standard  Libraries  section  to  account  for  new
       headers and options; for example, <u>&lt;spawn.h&gt;</u> added to the description of <b>-l</b> <b>rt</b>, and <b>-l</b> <b>trace</b> added for the
       Tracing option.

       POSIX.1‐2008 specifies that the <u>c99</u> utility must be able to use regular files for <b>*.o</b> files and for <b>a.out</b>
       files.  Implementations  are  free  to  overwrite existing files of other types when attempting to create
       object files and executable files, but are not required to do so. If something other than a regular  file
       is  specified  and  using it fails for any reason, <u>c99</u> is required to issue a diagnostic message and exit
       with a non-zero exit status. But for some file types, the problem may not be noticed for a long time. For
       example, if a FIFO named <b>a.out</b> exists in the current directory, <u>c99</u> may attempt to open  <b>a.out</b>  and  will
       hang  in the <u>open</u>() call until another process opens the FIFO for reading. Then <u>c99</u> may write most of the
       <b>a.out</b> to the FIFO and fail when it tries to seek back close  to  the  start  of  the  file  to  insert  a
       timestamp  (FIFOs  are  not  seekable  files).  The  <u>c99</u>  utility  is  also allowed to issue a diagnostic
       immediately if it encounters an <b>a.out</b> or <b>*.o</b>  file  that  is  not  a  regular  file.  For  portable  use,
       applications  should  ensure  that  any  <b>a.out</b>, <b>-o</b> option-argument, or <b>*.o</b> files corresponding to any <b>*.c</b>
       files do not conflict with names already in use that are not regular files or symbolic links  that  point
       to regular files.

       On  many systems, multi-threaded applications run in a programming environment that is distinct from that
       used by single-threaded applications. This multi-threaded programming environment (in addition to needing
       to specify <b>-l</b> <b>pthread</b> at link time) may require additional flags to be set when headers are processed  at
       compile  time  (<b>-D_REENTRANT</b>  being  common). This programming environment is orthogonal to the type size
       programming environments discussed above and listed in <u>Table</u> <u>4-4,</u> <u>Programming</u> <u>Environments:</u>  <u>Type</u>  <u>Sizes</u>.
       This version of the standard adds <u>getconf</u> utility calls to provide the C compiler flags and linker/loader
       flags  needed  to  support  multi-threaded  applications.  Note  that  on  a system where single-threaded
       applications are a special case of a multi-threaded application, both of these <u>getconf</u> calls  may  return
       NULL strings; on other implementations both of these strings may be non-NULL strings.

       The  C  standardization  committee invented trigraphs (e.g., <b>"??!"</b> to represent <b>'|'</b>) to address character
       portability problems in development environments based on national variants of the 7-bit ISO/IEC 646:1991
       standard character set. However, these environments were already obsolete by the  time  the  first  ISO C
       standard  was  published,  and  in  practice trigraphs have not been used for their intended purpose, and
       usually are intended to have their original meaning in K&amp;R C.  For  example,  in  practice  a  C-language
       source  string  like  <b>"What??!"</b>  is  usually  intended  to  end  in two &lt;question-mark&gt; characters and an
       &lt;exclamation-mark&gt;, not in <b>'|'</b>.

       When the <b>-E</b> option is used, execution of some <b>#pragma</b> preprocessor directives may simply result in a copy
       of the directive being included in the output as part of the allowed extra information used by subsequent
       compilation passes (see STDOUT).

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Unlike all of the other non-OB-shaded utilities in this standard, a utility by this  name  probably  will
       not  appear in the next version of this standard.  This utility's name is tied to the current revision of
       the ISO C standard at the time this standard is approved. Since the ISO C standard and this standard  are
       maintained by different organizations on different schedules, we cannot predict what the compiler will be
       named in the next version of the standard.
