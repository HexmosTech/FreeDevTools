       xargs - build and execute command lines from standard input

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xargs</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>command</u> [<u>initial-arguments</u>]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents the GNU version of <b>xargs</b>.  <b>xargs</b> reads items from the standard input, delimit‐
       ed  by  blanks (which can be protected with double or single quotes or a backslash) or newlines, and exe‐
       cutes the <u>command</u> (default is <u>echo</u>) one or more times with any <u>initial-arguments</u> followed by  items  read
       from standard input.  Blank lines on the standard input are ignored.

       The  command  line  for <u>command</u> is built up until it reaches a system-defined limit (unless the <b>-n</b> and <b>-L</b>
       options are used).  The specified <u>command</u> will be invoked as many times as necessary to use up  the  list
       of input items.  In general, there will be many fewer invocations of <u>command</u> than there were items in the
       input.  This will normally have significant performance benefits.  Some commands can usefully be executed
       in parallel too; see the <b>-P</b> option.

       Because  Unix  filenames  can  contain  blanks and newlines, this default behaviour is often problematic;
       filenames containing blanks and/or newlines are incorrectly processed by <b>xargs</b>.  In these  situations  it
       is  better  to  use the <b>-0</b> option, which prevents such problems.  When using this option you will need to
       ensure that the program which produces the input for <b>xargs</b> also uses a null character as a separator.  If
       that program is GNU <b>find</b> for example, the <b>-print0</b> option does this for you.

       If any invocation of the command exits with a status of 255, <b>xargs</b> will stop immediately without  reading
       any further input.  An error message is issued on stderr when this happens.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-0,</b> <b>--null</b>
              Input  items are terminated by a null character instead of by whitespace, and the quotes and back‐
              slash are not special (every character is taken  literally).   Disables  the  end-of-file  string,
              which  is  treated  like  any  other argument.  Useful when input items might contain white space,
              quote marks, or backslashes.  The GNU find -print0 option produces input suitable for this mode.

       <b>-a</b> <u>file</u><b>,</b> <b>--arg-file=</b><u>file</u>
              Read items from <u>file</u> instead of standard input.  If you use this option, stdin  remains  unchanged
              when commands are run.  Otherwise, stdin is redirected from <u>/dev/null</u>.

       <b>--delimiter=</b><u>delim</u><b>,</b> <b>-d</b> <u>delim</u>
              Input  items  are  terminated by the specified character.  The specified delimiter may be a single
              character, a C-style character escape such as <b>\n</b>, or an octal or hexadecimal escape  code.   Octal
              and  hexadecimal  escape codes are understood as for the <b>printf</b> command.  Multibyte characters are
              not supported.  When processing the input, quotes and backslash are not special;  every  character
              in  the input is taken literally.  The <b>-d</b> option disables any end-of-file string, which is treated
              like any other argument.  You can use this option when the input consists of simply  newline-sepa‐
              rated  items,  although it is almost always better to design your program to use <b>--null</b> where this
              is possible.

       <b>-E</b> <u>eof-str</u>
              Set the end-of-file string to <u>eof-str</u>.  If the end-of-file string occurs as a line of  input,  the
              rest of the input is ignored.  If neither <b>-E</b> nor <b>-e</b> is used, no end-of-file string is used.

       <b>-e</b>[<u>eof-str</u>], <b>--eof</b>[<u>=eof-str</u>]
              This  option  is a synonym for the <b>-E</b> option.  Use <b>-E</b> instead, because it is POSIX compliant while
              this option is not.  If <u>eof-str</u> is omitted, there is no end-of-file string.  If neither <b>-E</b> nor  <b>-e</b>
              is used, no end-of-file string is used.

       <b>-I</b> <u>replace-str</u>
              Replace  occurrences  of <u>replace-str</u> in the initial-arguments with names read from standard input.
              Also, unquoted blanks do not terminate input items; instead the separator is the  newline  charac‐
              ter.  Implies <b>-x</b> and <b>-L</b> 1.

       <b>-i</b>[<u>replace-str</u>], <b>--replace</b>[<u>=replace-str</u>]
              This  option is a synonym for <b>-I</b><u>replace-str</u> if <u>replace-str</u> is specified.  If the <u>replace-str</u> argu‐
              ment is missing, the effect is the same as <b>-I</b>{}.  The <b>-i</b> option is deprecated; use <b>-I</b> instead.

       <b>-L</b> <u>max-lines</u>
              Use at most <u>max-lines</u> nonblank input lines per command line.  Trailing blanks cause an input  line
              to be logically continued on the next input line.  Implies <b>-x</b>.

       <b>-l</b>[<u>max-lines</u>], <b>--max-lines</b>[=<u>max-lines</u>]
              Synonym  for  the  <b>-L</b> option.  Unlike <b>-L</b>, the <u>max-lines</u> argument is optional.  If <u>max-lines</u> is not
              specified, it defaults to one.  The <b>-l</b> option is deprecated since the POSIX standard specifies  <b>-L</b>
              instead.

       <b>-n</b> <u>max-args</u>, <b>--max-args</b>=<u>max-args</u>
              Use  at  most  <u>max-args</u> arguments per command line.  Fewer than <u>max-args</u> arguments will be used if
              the size (see the <b>-s</b> option) is exceeded, unless the <b>-x</b> option is given, in which case <b>xargs</b>  will
              exit.

       <b>-P</b> <u>max-procs</u>, <b>--max-procs</b>=<u>max-procs</u>
              Run  up  to <u>max-procs</u> processes at a time; the default is 1.  If <u>max-procs</u> is 0, <b>xargs</b> will run as
              many processes as possible at a time.  Use the <b>-n</b> option or  the  <b>-L</b>  option  with  <b>-P</b>;  otherwise
              chances  are  that only one exec will be done.  While <b>xargs</b> is running, you can send its process a
              SIGUSR1 signal to increase the number of commands to run simultaneously, or a SIGUSR2 to  decrease
              the  number.   You  cannot  increase it above an implementation-defined limit (which is shown with
              --show-limits).  You cannot decrease it below 1.  <b>xargs</b> never terminates its commands; when  asked
              to  decrease,  it merely waits for more than one existing command to terminate before starting an‐
              other.  <b>xargs</b> always waits for all child processes to exit before exiting itself (but see BUGS).

              If you do not use the <b>-P</b> option, <b>xargs</b> will not handle the SIGUSR1 and  SIGUSR2  signals,  meaning
              that  they will terminate the program (unless they were blocked in the parent process before <b>xargs</b>
              was started).

              <b>Please</b> <b>note</b> that it is up to the called processes to properly manage parallel access to shared re‐
              sources.  For example, if more than one of them tries to print to stdout, the output will be  pro‐
              duced  in  an  indeterminate  order (and very likely mixed up) unless the processes collaborate in
              some way to prevent this.  Using some kind of locking scheme is one way to prevent such  problems.
              In general, using a locking scheme will help ensure correct output but reduce performance.  If you
              don't  want  to  tolerate the performance difference, simply arrange for each process to produce a
              separate output file (or otherwise use separate resources).

       <b>-o,</b> <b>--open-tty</b>
              Reopen stdin as <u>/dev/tty</u> in the child process before executing the command.  This is useful if you
              want <b>xargs</b> to run an interactive application.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--interactive</b>
              Prompt the user about whether to run each command line and read a line from  the  terminal.   Only
              run the command line if the response starts with `y' or `Y'.  Implies <b>-t</b>.

       <b>--process-slot-var</b>=<u>name</u>
              Set  the  environment  variable  <u>name</u> to a unique value in each running child process.  Values are
              reused once child processes exit.  This can be used in a rudimentary load distribution scheme, for
              example.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--no-run-if-empty</b>
              If the standard input does not contain any nonblanks, do not run the command.  Normally, the  com‐
              mand is run once even if there is no input.  This option is a GNU extension.

       <b>-s</b> <u>max-chars</u>, <b>--max-chars</b><u>=max-chars</u>
              Use at most <u>max-chars</u> characters per command line, including the command and initial-arguments and
              the  terminating  nulls at the ends of the argument strings.  The largest allowed value is system-
              dependent, and is calculated as the argument length limit for exec, less the size of your environ‐
              ment, less 2048 bytes of headroom.  If this value is more than 128 KiB, 128 KiB is used as the de‐
              fault value; otherwise, the default value is the maximum.  1 KiB is 1024 bytes.   <b>xargs</b>  automati‐
              cally adapts to tighter constraints.

       <b>--show-limits</b>
              Display  the  limits  on the command-line length which are imposed by the operating system, <b>xargs</b>'
              choice of buffer size and the <b>-s</b> option.  Pipe the input from <u>/dev/null</u> (and perhaps specify <b>--no-</b>
              <b>run-if-empty</b>) if you don't want <b>xargs</b> to do anything.

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Print the command line on the standard error output before executing it.

       <b>-x,</b> <b>--exit</b>
              Exit if the size (see the <b>-s</b> option) is exceeded.

       <b>--</b>     Delimit the option list.  Later arguments, if any, are treated as operands even if they begin with
              <u>-</u>.  For example, <b>xargs</b> <b>--</b> <b>--help</b> runs the command <u>--help</u> (found in <u>PATH</u>) instead of  printing  the
              usage text, and <b>xargs</b> <b>--</b> <b>--mycommand</b> runs the command <u>--mycommand</u> instead of rejecting this as un‐
              recognized option.

       <b>--help</b> Print a summary of the options to <b>xargs</b> and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
              Print the version number of <b>xargs</b> and exit.

       The options <b>--max-lines</b> (<b>-L</b>, <b>-l</b>), <b>--replace</b> (<b>-I</b>, <b>-i</b>) and <b>--max-args</b> (<b>-n</b>) are mutually exclusive.  If some
       of  them  are  specified at the same time, then <b>xargs</b> will generally use the option specified last on the
       command line, i.e., it will reset the value of the offending option (given before) to its default  value.
       Additionally,  <b>xargs</b>  will  issue a warning diagnostic on <u>stderr</u>.  The exception to this rule is that the
       special <u>max-args</u> value <u>1</u> ('<b>-n</b><u>1</u>') is ignored after the <b>--replace</b> option and its aliases <b>-I</b> and <b>-i</b>, because
       it would not actually conflict.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>find</b> <b><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></b> <b>-name</b> <b>core</b> <b>-type</b> <b>f</b> <b>-print</b> <b>|</b> <b>xargs</b> <b><a href="file:/bin/rm">/bin/rm</a></b> <b>-f</b>

       Find files named <b>core</b> in or below the directory <b><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></b> and delete them.  Note that this  will  work  incor‐
       rectly if there are any filenames containing newlines or spaces.

       <b>find</b> <b><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></b> <b>-name</b> <b>core</b> <b>-type</b> <b>f</b> <b>-print0</b> <b>|</b> <b>xargs</b> <b>-0</b> <b><a href="file:/bin/rm">/bin/rm</a></b> <b>-f</b>

       Find  files named <b>core</b> in or below the directory <b><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></b> and delete them, processing filenames in such a way
       that file or directory names containing spaces or newlines are correctly handled.

       <b>find</b> <b><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></b> <b>-depth</b> <b>-name</b> <b>core</b> <b>-type</b> <b>f</b> <b>-delete</b>

       Find files named <b>core</b> in or below the directory <b><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></b> and delete them, but more efficiently  than  in  the
       previous example (because we avoid the need to use <b><a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</a></b>(2) and <b><a href="../man2/exec.2.html">exec</a></b>(2) to launch <b>rm</b> and we don't need the
       extra <b>xargs</b> process).

       <b>cut</b> <b>-d:</b> <b>-f1</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b><a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a></b> <b>|</b> <b>sort</b> <b>|</b> <b>xargs</b> <b>echo</b>

       Generates a compact listing of all the users on the system.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xargs</b> exits with the following status:

              0      if it succeeds

              123    if any invocation of the command exited with status 1–125

              124    if the command exited with status 255

              125    if the command is killed by a signal

              126    if the command cannot be run

              127    if the command is not found

              1      if some other error occurred.

       Exit codes greater than 128 are used by the shell to indicate that a program died due to a fatal signal.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b> <b>CONFORMANCE</b></h4><pre>
       As  of GNU xargs version 4.2.9, the default behaviour of <b>xargs</b> is not to have a logical end-of-file mark‐
       er.  POSIX (IEEE Std 1003.1, 2004 Edition) allows this.

       The -l and -i options appear in the 1997 version of the POSIX standard, but do not  appear  in  the  2004
       version of the standard.  Therefore you should use -L and -I instead, respectively.

       The -o option is an extension to the POSIX standard for better compatibility with BSD.

       The POSIX standard allows implementations to have a limit on the size of arguments to the <b>exec</b> functions.
       This  limit  could  be  as  low  as  4096 bytes including the size of the environment.  For scripts to be
       portable, they must not rely on a larger value.  However, I know of no implementation whose actual  limit
       is  that  small.  The <b>--show-limits</b> option can be used to discover the actual limits in force on the cur‐
       rent system.

       In versions of <b>xargs</b> up to and including version 4.9.0, SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 would not cause <b>xargs</b> to ter‐
       minate even if the <b>-P</b> option was not used.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>xargs</b> program was invented by Herb Gellis at Bell Labs.  See the Texinfo manual for findutils,  <u>Find‐</u>
       <u>ing</u> <u>Files</u>, for more information.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       It  is not possible for <b>xargs</b> to be used securely, since there will always be a time gap between the pro‐
       duction of the list of input files and their use in the commands that <b>xargs</b> issues.  If other users  have
       access  to  the system, they can manipulate the filesystem during this time window to force the action of
       the commands <b>xargs</b> runs to apply to files that you didn't intend.  For a more detailed discussion of this
       and related problems, please refer to the ``Security Considerations'' chapter in  the  findutils  Texinfo
       documentation.  The <b>-execdir</b> option of <b>find</b> can often be used as a more secure alternative.

       When  you use the <b>-I</b> option, each line read from the input is buffered internally.  This means that there
       is an upper limit on the length of input line that <b>xargs</b> will accept when used with the  <b>-I</b>  option.   To
       work  around this limitation, you can use the <b>-s</b> option to increase the amount of buffer space that <b>xargs</b>
       uses, and you can also use an extra invocation of <b>xargs</b> to ensure that very long lines do not occur.  For
       example:

       <b>somecommand</b> <b>|</b> <b>xargs</b> <b>-s</b> <b>50000</b> <b>echo</b> <b>|</b> <b>xargs</b> <b>-I</b> <b>'{}'</b> <b>-s</b> <b>100000</b> <b>rm</b> <b>'{}'</b>

       Here, the first invocation of <b>xargs</b> has no input line length limit because it doesn't use the <b>-i</b>  option.
       The  second  invocation  of  <b>xargs</b> does have such a limit, but we have ensured that it never encounters a
       line which is longer than it can handle.  This is not an ideal solution.  Instead, the <b>-i</b>  option  should
       not  impose  a  line length limit, which is why this discussion appears in the BUGS section.  The problem
       doesn't occur with the output of <b><a href="../man1/find.1.html">find</a></b>(1) because it emits just one filename per line.

       In versions of <b>xargs</b> up to and including version 4.9.0, <b>xargs</b> <b>-P</b> would exit while some  of  its  children
       were still running, if one of them exited with status 255.
