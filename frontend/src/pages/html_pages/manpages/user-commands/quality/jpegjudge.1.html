</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <u>jpegjudge</u> - guess jpeg picture quality

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>jpegjudge</b> [ <b>-V</b> ]

       <b>jpegjudge</b> [ <b>-b</b> ] file ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Jpegjudge</u>  reads each argument and attempts to guess the quality with which it was saved. Currently, only
       a rough indicator is calculcated, ranging from 0 (lowest quality) to 1000 (highest quality), an extension
       to other formats would be straightforward, but isn't planned.

       It can read all pictures the <b>IJG</b> <b>jpeg</b> <b>library</b> can read, i.e. normal and progressive jpeg's.

   <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-b</b>     Display only quality indicator, suppress other information (filenames).

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Display short summary of options.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Display version number and exit.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       It should be possible to judge pictures stored in non-lossy formats, too, since conversion  to  jpeg  may
       influence the measurement.

       The quality indicator is non-linear, and could be much better.

       The algorithm to calculate the quality was made up in 10 minutes, after staring at various histograms.

</pre><h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       This program contains code from the <b>IJG</b> <b>jpeg</b> <b>software.</b>
