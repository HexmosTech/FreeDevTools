</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Zero  Install  is a decentralised cross-distribution software installation system. Programs and libraries
       are identified by URIs, and there is no need for a central repository. Zero Install ensures that packages
       cannot conflict with each other and that programs can be shared between mutually  untrusting  users.  See
       the web-site for more information:

       <a href="http://0install.net/">http://0install.net/</a>

       The simplest case is to ask 0install to run a program, given its URI. For example:

       <b>0install</b> <b>run</b> <b><a href="http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit">http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit</a></b>

       The  first  time  you do this, details about available versions of the program are downloaded and cached,
       along with details about any libraries it depends on.

       Zero Install will run a solver to select the best version of each component to use. For example, it  will
       select  binaries  that are compatible with your CPU and operating system, in your preferred language, and
       marked "stable" (by default).

       If $DISPLAY is set, 0install will display a window  where  you  can  confirm  (or  change)  the  selected
       versions.

       It will then download the corresponding archives for those versions and store them in the cache too. Each
       package unpacks to its own directory.

       Finally, 0install will launch the program, setting environment variables to let it locate its libraries.

</pre><h4><b>GLOBAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  first  non-option  argument to 0install is the particular sub-command you want to perform; these are
       described in detail in the next section.

       However, there are some options that apply to all operations. These are:

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--console</b>
              Never use the GUI. Normally, 0install switches to graphical mode if it needs to download  anything
              from the network (unless DISPLAY is not set).

       <b>--dry-run</b>
              Do  not save any changes to disk, and do not actually run the program. Instead, just print out the
              changes that would have been made. Note that,  as  0install  is  a  very  safe  system,  there  is
              generally no need to use this option. However, it can be useful as a learning aid or for testing.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Show the built-in help text.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--offline</b>
              Run  in  off-line  mode,  overriding the default setting. This prevents 0install from checking for
              updates, and from downloading updates even if it knows about them.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              More verbose output. Use twice for even more verbose output.

       <b>--with-store=DIR</b>
              Append a directory to the list of implementation caches. Each sub-directory of  DIR  contains  the
              contents of one version of a program or library.

</pre><h4><b>SUB-COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>0install</b> <b>select</b> <b>[OPTIONS]</b> <b>URI</b>
       Select  a  version  of the program identified by URI, and compatible versions of all of its dependencies.
       The information about available versions is downloaded if it's not yet in the cache.

       The  URI  can  be  an  HTTP  URL,  such  as  `<a href="http://site/program.xml">http://site/program.xml</a>'  or  a  local   path   name   like
       `file:///path/to/program.xml'.

       For HTTP URLs, the remote file is a signed XML document. If the key is not known and trusted, you will be
       prompted to accept it first. Local feed files are not signed (any signature will be ignored).

       You  can  also  specify a local selections document, as created previously using the <b>--xml</b> option, rather
       than a feed. In that case, 0install simply uses those versions without running the solver.

       After selecting (but not downloading) a set of versions, the selection is displayed in  a  human-readable
       format. Use <b>--xml</b> to get machine-readable output.

       If  a  set  of  versions cannot be selected using the cached information, 0install will check for updates
       first.

       If a set of versions can be selected based on the currently-cached information, but that  information  is
       getting  stale,  0install  will immediately return the current selection and will also start a background
       process to check for updates.  The `freshness' configuration setting controls when cached information  is
       considered to be stale.

       Options for select:

       <b>--before=VERSION</b>
              Select  a  version earlier than VERSION (i.e. force the use of an old version of the program). You
              can only restrict the version of the program itself using this option,  not  the  version  of  any
              dependencies.

       <b>--command=COMMAND</b>
              Some  programs provide multiple commands. This selects which one you want. Common values are `run'
              (the default), `test' (used by  0test)  and  `compile'  (used  by  0compile).  You  can  also  use
              <b>--command=""</b>  if  you  don't  want  to  run any command (for example, if the package contains data
              rather than a program).

       <b>--may-compile</b>
              Treat every source implementation as a potential binary.  This can be used to find what  needs  to
              be compiled to run a program.  Currently this is only available for "0install select".

       <b>--message=MESSAGE</b>
              If  we show a dialog box for the download, display MESSAGE to the user to explain why the download
              is needed.

       <b>--not-before=VERSION</b>
              The selected version must not be earlier than VERSION.  e.g. if you want to  run  version  2.0  or
              later, use <b>--not-before=2.0</b>.

       <b>--refresh</b>
              Download  a fresh copy of all used feeds before selecting. Normally, cached copies will be used if
              available (checking for updates later, in the background).

       <b>--source</b>
              Select source code rather than a binary. This is used internally by `0compile'.

       <b>--version=RANGE</b>
              Require a version of the main program within the given range. This can be a  simple  number  (e.g.
              <b>--version=2.3</b>)  or a range (e.g. <b>--version=2.3..!2.7</b>).  For ranges, either end may be omitted. The
              "!" indicates that the range excludes the final value. Alternatives can be separated by "|",  e.g.
              "2.6..!3 | 3.2.." (allows 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, etc, but not 2.5 or 3.0).

              You can also force a particular implementation by its ID, using the syntax "=FEED/ID".  ID must be
              escaped:  Letters,  digits, '-', '.', and characters &gt; 127 stay as they are; "/" becomes "__"; and
              other characters become "_code_", where code is the lowercase hex value of the byte.

       <b>--version-for=URI</b> <b>RANGE</b>
              Specifies the range (as for <b>--version</b>) for any library or sub-component. If <b>URI</b> is the URI of  the
              main program then this is equivalent to using <b>--version</b>.

       <b>--xml</b>  Print  the set of chosen implementations as an XML document to stdout. This can be used later with
              the `download' and `run' sub-commands.

       `select' returns an exit status of zero if it selected a set of versions, and a status of 1 if  it  could
       not find a consistent set.

   <b>0install</b> <b>download</b> <b>[OPTIONS]</b> <b>URI</b>
       This  behaves similarly to `0install select', except that it also downloads the selected versions if they
       are not already cached. Unlike `select', it does not print the selected versions by default.

       All options for `select' can also be used for `download'. In addition, these options are available:

       <b>--show</b> Print the selected versions in a human-readable format to stdout.

       `download' returns an exit status of zero if it selected a suitable set of versions and they are now  all
       downloaded and in the cache. It returns a status of 1 otherwise.

   <b>0install</b> <b>run</b> <b>[OPTIONS]</b> <b>URI</b> <b>[ARGS]</b>
       This  behaves similarly to `0install download', except that it also runs the program after ensuring it is
       in the cache.

       To avoid having to keep typing the full URI, use the `0install add' command to create  shortcuts  to  run
       your programs.

       All  options  for  `select'  can  also be used for `run' except for <b>--xml</b>. In addition, these options are
       available:

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--main=MAIN</b>
              Run the specified executable instead of the default. If MAIN starts with  '/'  then  the  path  is
              relative  to  the  implementation's  top-level  directory, whereas otherwise it is relative to the
              directory containing the default MAIN program. For example, if the default MAIN  is  <b>bin/svn</b>  then
              using  <b>--main=svnadmin</b> will run <b>.../bin/svnadmin</b> instead.  This option has been largely superseded
              by the newer <b>--command</b> option.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--wrapper=WRAPPER</b>
              Instead of executing the chosen program directly, run <b>WRAPPER</b> <b>PROGRAM</b> <b>ARGS</b>.  This  is  useful  for
              running  debuggers  and  tracing  tools  on  the program (rather than on 0install!). Note that the
              wrapper is executed in the environment selected by the program; hence, this  mechanism  cannot  be
              used for sandboxing. See the DEBUGGING section below.

       Note  that  any options after `URI' will be passed to the program being run rather than being interpreted
       by 0install.

       `run' returns an exit status of 1 if the download step failed. Otherwise, the exit  status  will  be  the
       exit status of the program being run.

   <b>0install</b> <b>update</b> <b>[OPTIONS]</b> <b>URI</b>
       Check  for  updates  to  the  program  and  download  them if found. This is similar to <b>0install</b> <b>download</b>
       <b>--refresh</b>, except that it prints information about whether any changes were found.

       The options are the same as for `select'.

   <b>0install</b> <b>import</b> <b>FEED</b>
       Import a feed from a local file, as if it had been downloaded from the  network.   This  is  useful  when
       testing  a  feed  file,  to avoid uploading it to a remote server in order to download it again. The file
       must have a trusted digital signature, as when fetching from the network.

       It is also useful when installing a feed from a CD or  similar.  Note:  to  create  a  full  bundle,  for
       archiving or distribution on CD, see <a href="../man1/0export.1.html">0export</a>(1).

   <b>0install</b> <b>add-feed</b> <b>[INTERFACE]</b> <b>FEED</b>
       Register an additional source of implementations (versions) of a program.

       For example, when you check out a developer version of a project, it may contain an XML feed file. To add
       this  version  to the list of available versions, use `add-feed' on the XML file. The file is not copied,
       so you don't need to re-add the feed each time it is updated. You will probably  also  want  to  set  the
       `help_with_testing' configuration option to ensure that testing versions are selected by default.

       Note that if you just want to run the program, you can invoke 0install on the feed file directly (without
       using `add-feed'). This will force the it to use that version, but won't affect what happens when you run
       it using the URI as normal. Use `add-feed' when you want to use the developer version even when using the
       URI, or if the program is a library (and thus referenced by URI by other programs).

   <b>0install</b> <b>remove-feed</b> <b>[INTERFACE]</b> <b>FEED</b>
       Un-register  a  feed, reversing the effect of `add-feed'. If INTERFACE is not given, you will be prompted
       to choose which INTERFACE to remove it from.

   <b>0install</b> <b>list-feeds</b> <b>URI</b>
       List all extra feeds added to URI using `add-feed'.

   <b>0install</b> <b>list</b> <b>[PATTERN]</b>
       List all locally-cached interface (program) URIs. If a search term is given, only  URIs  containing  that
       string are shown (case insensitive).

   <b>0install</b> <b>search</b> <b>QUERY</b>
       Send  the query string to the mirror server and display any interfaces it returns.  Note that the default
       mirror server indexes all known feeds, regardless of quality;  you  must  decide  whether  to  trust  the
       programs before running them.

   <b>0install</b> <b>config</b> <b>[NAME</b> <b>[VALUE]]</b>
       View or change configuration settings.

       With no arguments, `0install config' displays all configuration settings.  With one argument, it displays
       the current value of the named setting.  With two arguments, it sets the setting to the given value.

   <b>0install</b> <b>man</b> <b>COMMAND</b>
       Show  the  man-page of the given command. If the single argument <b>COMMAND</b> is a launcher script (created by
       "0install add") then the man-page is searched for by 0install, otherwise the arguments are passed through
       directly to the system's man command. This allows you to do:

       <b>alias</b> <b>man="0install</b> <b>man</b> <b>--"</b>

   <b>0install</b> <b>digest</b> <b>DIRECTORY</b> <b>|</b> <b>ARCHIVE</b> <b>[EXTRACT]</b>
       Calculate the secure hash of an implementation. This is a unique "fingerprint" of a directory and all the
       files and subdirectories it contains. When publishing a program using 0install, this value must be placed
       in the XML file.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--algorithm=HASH</b>
              Select the secure hash function to be used. Supported values are "sha1new" (the default), "sha256"
              and "sha256new".

       If an archive is given then the hash is for the directory that would  be  created  if  the  archive  were
       unpacked (or the EXTRACT subdirectory of it, if one is specified).

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--manifest</b>

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--digest</b>

       These options control whether to display the manifest itself (one line for each file or directory) or the
       manifest's digest (or both). If neither option is given, the digest is displayed.

   <b>0install</b> <b>--version</b>
       This can be used (without any command) the get version of 0install itself.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       An application provides an easy way to run a program without typing the full URL each time.

   <b>0install</b> <b>add</b> <b>NAME</b> <b>URI</b>
       Creates  a  new  application  called  <b>NAME</b>  (which  can  be  whatever you want) to run the program <b>URI</b>. A
       directory (by default, <a href="file:~/.config/0install.net/apps/NAME">~/.config/0install.net/apps/NAME</a>) is created to record the current selections,  as
       would be produced by "0install select --xml URI".

       A  launcher  command  (also  called  <b>NAME</b>)  will  be  created  in $PATH to provide an easy way to run the
       application. For example, to add and run ROX-Filer:

       <b>$</b> <b>0install</b> <b>add</b> <b>rox</b> <b><a href="http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/ROX-Filer">http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/ROX-Filer</a></b>

       <b>$</b> <b>rox</b>

       If additional requirements are given (as for "0install select", e.g. --before), they are stored with  the
       application and apply to all updates.

   <b>0install</b> <b>show</b> <b>NAME</b> <b>|</b> <b>SELECTIONS</b>
       Show  the  current  selections  for  this  application (or the contents of the given selections file). By
       default, the output is in the same format as for "0install select", and the --xml  option  has  the  same
       effect.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--root-uri</b>
              Just  display  the root interface URI (e.g. the URI passed to "0install add" when this application
              was created).

   <b>0install</b> <b>update</b> <b>NAME</b>
       The feeds used to make the selections are updated and a new set of selections is generated and saved into
       the application's directory. Even if you don't run this  command  explicitly,  0install  will  check  for
       updates if you run the program and it hasn't been updated for a while. This happens in the background and
       does not delay starting the program.

       If  additional  requirements  are  given  (as  for  "0install  select",  e.g.  --before), they update the
       requirements stored with the application and apply to this and future updates.

   <b>0install</b> <b>whatchanged</b> <b>NAME</b>
       Show the differences between the current and previous selections for this application. Various times  may
       also  be displayed: "Last checked" is the last time we successfully checked for updates (even if none was
       found), "Last attempted update" is the last time we tried to check for updates, and "Last update" is  the
       last time changes were found. If "Last attempted update" is shown, then either the last updated failed or
       an update is currently in progress.

       By  default,  only  changes  that  resulted  in  a different version being selected are shown. To see all
       changes, use --full. Note that at most one set of selections is saved per day.

   <b>0install</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>NAME</b>
       The application <b>NAME</b> is deleted, along with any launchers added for it.

   <b>0install</b> <b>store</b> <b>...</b>
       Provides low-level access to the store of cached implementations. See the <a href="../man1/0store.1.html">0store</a>(1) man-page for details.

   <b>0install</b> <b>slave</b>
       Run 0install in slave mode (currently EXPERIMENTAL and likely to change). You can send JSON  requests  to
       the process's standard input and receive responses from its standard output.

</pre><h4><b>DEBUGGING</b> <b>TIPS</b></h4><pre>
       To debug 0install itself, use the --verbose and --console options. For example:

       <b>$</b> <b>0install</b> <b>-vvc</b> <b>run</b> <b><a href="http://myprog">http://myprog</a></b>

       To trace or debug programs run by 0install, use the --wrapper option.  For example, to run <b>myprog</b> <b>--help</b>,
       displaying all calls to <a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a>(2):

       <b>$</b> <b>0install</b> <b>run</b> <b>--wrapper="strace</b> <b>-e</b> <b>open"</b> <b><a href="http://myprog">http://myprog</a></b> <b>--help</b>

       To run the application under the gdb debugger:

       <b>$</b> <b>0install</b> <b>run</b> <b>--wrapper="gdb</b> <b>--args"</b> <b><a href="http://myprog">http://myprog</a></b> <b>--help</b>

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Configuration files (see freedesktop.org basedir spec):

       <a href="file:~/.config/0install.net/injector/global">~/.config/0install.net/injector/global</a>
              Global configuration settings.

       <a href="file:~/.config/0install.net/injector/trustdb.xml">~/.config/0install.net/injector/trustdb.xml</a>
              List of trusted keys.

       <a href="file:~/.config/0install.net/injector/feeds">~/.config/0install.net/injector/feeds</a>
              Per-feed information (e.g. time of last check).

       <a href="file:~/.config/0install.net/injector/interfaces">~/.config/0install.net/injector/interfaces</a>
              Per-interface settings (preferred stability and any extra feeds that have been registered).

       Cached data (can be re-downloaded if lost):

       <a href="file:~/.cache/0install.net/interfaces">~/.cache/0install.net/interfaces</a>
              Downloaded cached feed files.

       <a href="file:~/.cache/0install.net/implementations">~/.cache/0install.net/implementations</a>
              Downloaded cached implementations, indexed by manifest digest.

       See the <a href="../man1/0store.1.html">0store</a>(1) man page for more information.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       XDG_*  The  configuration  and  cache  directories can be changed using <b>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</b>, <b>XDG_CONFIG_DIRS</b>,
              <b>XDG_CACHE_HOME</b> and <b>XDG_CACHE_DIRS</b>, as usual.

       ZEROINSTALL_PORTABLE_BASE

              If this is set, then the XDG_ variables are ignored and the configuration and cache are stored  in
              <b>$ZEROINSTALL_PORTABLE_BASE/config</b> and <b>$ZEROINSTALL_PORTABLE_BASE/cache</b> instead.

       ZEROINSTALL_EXTERNAL_STORE

              When  0install  wants  to  add  an archive to the cache, it calls this program instead of doing it
