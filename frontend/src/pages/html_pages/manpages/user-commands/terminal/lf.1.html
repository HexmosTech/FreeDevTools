</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       This  section  shows  information about built-in commands.  Modal commands do not take any arguments, but
       instead change the operation mode to read their input conveniently, and so they are meant to be  assigned
       to keybindings.

   <b>quit</b> <b>(default</b> q)
       Quit lf and return to the shell.

   <b>up</b>  <b>(default</b> k and &lt;up&gt;), half-up (default &lt;c-u&gt;), page-up (default &lt;c-b&gt; and &lt;pgup&gt;), scroll-up (default &lt;c-
       y&gt;), down (default j and &lt;down&gt;), half-down  (default  &lt;c-d&gt;),  page-down  (default  &lt;c-f&gt;  and  &lt;pgdn&gt;),
       scroll-down (default &lt;c-e&gt;)
       Move/scroll the current file selection upwards/downwards by one/half a page/full page.

   <b>updir</b> <b>(default</b> h and &lt;left&gt;)
       Change the current working directory to the parent directory.

   <b>open</b> <b>(default</b> l and &lt;right&gt;)
       If  the current file is a directory, then change the current directory to it, otherwise, execute the open
       command.  A default open command is provided to call the default system opener  asynchronously  with  the
       current file as the argument.  A custom open command can be defined to override this default.

   <b>jump-next</b> <b>(default</b> ]), jump-prev (default [)
       Change the current working directory to the next/previous jumplist item.

   <b>top</b> <b>(default</b> gg and &lt;home&gt;), bottom (default G and &lt;end&gt;)
       Move  the current file selection to the top/bottom of the directory.  A count can be specified to move to
       a specific line, for example, use 3G to move to the third line.

   <b>high</b> <b>(default</b> H), middle (default M), low (default L)
       Move the current file selection to the high/middle/low of the screen.

   <b>toggle</b>
       Toggle the selection of the current file or files given as arguments.

   <b>invert</b> <b>(default</b> v)
       Reverse the selection of all files in the current directory (i.e.  toggle all files).  Selections in oth‐
       er directories are not affected by this command.  You can define a new command to select all files in the
       directory by combining invert with unselect (i.e.  cmd select-all :unselect; invert),  though  this  will
       also remove selections in other directories.

   <b>invert-below</b>
       Reverse the selection (i.e.  toggle) of all files at or after the current file in the current directory.

       To select a contiguous block of files, use this command on the first file you want to select.  Then, move
       down to the first file you do <u>not</u> want to select (the one after the end of the desired selection) and use
       this command again.  This achieves an effect similar to the visual mode in Vim.

       This  command  is experimental and may be removed once a better replacement for the visual mode is imple‐
       mented in lf.  If you'd like to experiment with using this command, you should bind it to a key (e.g.  V)
       for a better experience.

   <b>unselect</b> <b>(default</b> u)
       Remove the selection of all files in all directories.

   <b>glob-select,</b> <b>glob-unselect</b>
       Select/unselect files that match the given glob.

   <b>calcdirsize</b>
       Calculate the total size for each of the selected directories.  Option info should include size  and  op‐
       tion dircounts should be disabled to show this size.  If the total size of a directory is not calculated,
       it will be shown as -.

   <b>clearmaps</b>
       Remove  all  keybindings associated with the map command.  This command can be used in the config file to
       remove the default keybindings.  For safety purposes, : is left mapped to the read command, and cmap key‐
       bindings are retained so that it is still possible to exit lf using :quit.

   <b>copy</b> <b>(default</b> y)
       If there are no selections, save the path of the current file to the copy  buffer,  otherwise,  copy  the
       paths of selected files.

   <b>cut</b> <b>(default</b> d)
       If  there  are  no  selections,  save the path of the current file to the cut buffer, otherwise, copy the
       paths of selected files.

   <b>paste</b> <b>(default</b> p)
       Copy/Move files in the copy/cut buffer to the current working directory.  A custom paste command  can  be
       defined to override this default.

   <b>clear</b> <b>(default</b> c)
       Clear file paths in copy/cut buffer.

   <b>sync</b>
       Synchronize copied/cut files with the server.  This command is automatically called when required.

   <b>draw</b>
       Draw the screen.  This command is automatically called when required.

   <b>redraw</b> <b>(default</b> &lt;c-l&gt;)
       Synchronize the terminal and redraw the screen.

   <b>load</b>
       Load modified files and directories.  This command is automatically called when required.

   <b>reload</b> <b>(default</b> &lt;c-r&gt;)
       Flush the cache and reload all files and directories.

   <b>echo</b>
       Print the given arguments to the message line at the bottom.

   <b>echomsg</b>
       Print the given arguments to the message line at the bottom and also to the log file.

   <b>echoerr</b>
       Print given arguments to the message line at the bottom as errorfmt and also to the log file.

   <b>cd</b>
       Change the working directory to the given argument.

   <b>select</b>
       Change the current file selection to the given argument.

   <b>delete</b> <b>(modal)</b>
       Remove the current file or selected file(s).  A custom delete command can be defined to override this de‐
       fault.

   <b>rename</b> <b>(modal)</b> <b>(default</b> r)
       Rename  the  current  file using the built-in method.  A custom rename command can be defined to override
       this default.

   <b>source</b>
       Read the configuration file given in the argument.

   <b>push</b>
       Simulate key pushes given in the argument.

   <b>read</b> <b>(modal)</b> <b>(default</b> :)
       Read a command to evaluate.

   <b>shell</b> <b>(modal)</b> <b>(default</b> $)
       Read a shell command to execute.

   <b>shell-pipe</b> <b>(modal)</b> <b>(default</b> %)
       Read a shell command to execute piping its standard I/O to the bottom statline.

   <b>shell-wait</b> <b>(modal)</b> <b>(default</b> !)
       Read a shell command to execute and wait for a key press in the end.

   <b>shell-async</b> <b>(modal)</b> <b>(default</b> &amp;)
       Read a shell command to execute asynchronously without standard I/O.

   <b>find</b> <b>(modal)</b> <b>(default</b> f), find-back (modal) (default F), find-next (default ;), find-prev (default ,)
       Read key(s) to find the appropriate file name match in the forward/backward direction  and  jump  to  the
       next/previous match.

   <b>search</b> <b>(default</b> /), search-back (default ?), search-next (default n), search-prev (default N)
       Read  a  pattern  to  search  for  a  file  name  match in the forward/backward direction and jump to the
       next/previous match.

   <b>filter</b> <b>(modal),</b> <b>setfilter</b>
       Command filter reads a pattern to filter out and only view files matching the pattern.  Command setfilter
       does the same but uses an argument to set the filter immediately.  You can supply an argument  to  filter
       to use as the starting prompt.

   <b>mark-save</b> <b>(modal)</b> <b>(default</b> m)
       Save the current directory as a bookmark assigned to the given key.

   <b>mark-load</b> <b>(modal)</b> <b>(default</b> ')
       Change  the  current directory to the bookmark assigned to the given key.  A special bookmark ' holds the
       previous directory after a mark-load, cd, or select command.

   <b>mark-remove</b> <b>(modal)</b> <b>(default</b> ")
       Remove a bookmark assigned to the given key.

   <b>tag</b>
       Tag a file with * or a single-width character given in the argument.  You can define a  new  tag-clearing
       command by combining tag with tag-toggle (i.e.  cmd tag-clear :tag; tag-toggle).

   <b>tag-toggle</b> <b>(default</b> t)
       Tag  a  file  with * or a single width character given in the argument if the file is untagged, otherwise
       remove the tag.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The prompt character specifies which of the several command-line modes you are in.  For example, the read
       command takes you to the : mode.

       When the cursor is at the first character in : mode, pressing one of the keys !, $, %, or &amp; takes you  to
       the corresponding mode.  You can go back with cmd-delete-back (&lt;backspace&gt; by default).

       The command line commands should be mostly compatible with readline keybindings.  A character refers to a
       Unicode  code  point,  a  word  consists of letters and digits, and a unix word consists of any non-blank
       characters.

   <b>cmd-escape</b> <b>(default</b> &lt;esc&gt;)
       Quit command line mode and return to normal mode.

   <b>cmd-complete</b> <b>(default</b> &lt;tab&gt;)
       Autocomplete the current word.

   <b>cmd-menu-complete,</b> <b>cmd-menu-complete-back</b>
       Autocomplete the current word with the menu selection.  You need to assign keys to these  commands  (e.g.
       cmap  &lt;tab&gt;  cmd-menu-complete; cmap &lt;backtab&gt; cmd-menu-complete-back).  You can use the assigned keys to
       display the menu and then cycle through completion options.

   <b>cmd-menu-accept</b>
       Accept the currently selected match in menu completion and close the menu.

   <b>cmd-enter</b> <b>(default</b> &lt;c-j&gt; and &lt;enter&gt;)
       Execute the current line.

   <b>cmd-interrupt</b> <b>(default</b> &lt;c-c&gt;)
       Interrupt the current shell-pipe command and return to the normal mode.

   <b>cmd-history-next</b> <b>(default</b> &lt;c-n&gt; and &lt;down&gt;), cmd-history-prev (default &lt;c-p&gt; and &lt;up&gt;)
       Go to the next/previous item in the history.

   <b>cmd-left</b> <b>(default</b> &lt;c-b&gt; and &lt;left&gt;), cmd-right (default &lt;c-f&gt; and &lt;right&gt;)
       Move the cursor to the left/right.

   <b>cmd-home</b> <b>(default</b> &lt;c-a&gt; and &lt;home&gt;), cmd-end (default &lt;c-e&gt; and &lt;end&gt;)
       Move the cursor to the beginning/end of the line.

   <b>cmd-delete</b> <b>(default</b> &lt;c-d&gt; and &lt;delete&gt;)
       Delete the next character.

   <b>cmd-delete-back</b> <b>(default</b> &lt;backspace&gt; and &lt;backspace2&gt;)
       Delete the previous character.  When at the beginning of a prompt, returns either to normal mode or to  :
       mode.

   <b>cmd-delete-home</b> <b>(default</b> &lt;c-u&gt;), cmd-delete-end (default &lt;c-k&gt;)
       Delete everything up to the beginning/end of the line.

   <b>cmd-delete-unix-word</b> <b>(default</b> &lt;c-w&gt;)
       Delete the previous unix word.

   <b>cmd-yank</b> <b>(default</b> &lt;c-y&gt;)
       Paste the buffer content containing the last deleted item.

   <b>cmd-transpose</b> <b>(default</b> &lt;c-t&gt;), cmd-transpose-word (default &lt;a-t&gt;)
       Transpose the positions of the last two characters/words.

   <b>cmd-word</b> <b>(default</b> &lt;a-f&gt;), cmd-word-back (default &lt;a-b&gt;)
       Move the cursor by one word in the forward/backward direction.

   <b>cmd-delete-word</b> <b>(default</b> &lt;a-d&gt;)
       Delete the next word in the forward direction.

   <b>cmd-delete-word-back</b> <b>(default</b> &lt;a-backspace&gt; and &lt;a-backspace2&gt;)
       Delete the previous word in the backward direction.

   <b>cmd-capitalize-word</b> <b>(default</b> &lt;a-c&gt;), cmd-uppercase-word (default &lt;a-u&gt;), cmd-lowercase-word (default &lt;a-l&gt;)
       Capitalize/uppercase/lowercase the current word and jump to the next word.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This section shows information about options to customize the behavior.  Character : is used as the sepa‐
       rator for list options []int and []string.

   <b>anchorfind</b> <b>(bool)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>true)</b>
       When  this option is enabled, the find command starts matching patterns from the beginning of file names,
       otherwise, it can match at an arbitrary position.

   <b>autoquit</b> <b>(bool)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>true)</b>
       Automatically quit the server when there are no clients left connected.

   <b>borderfmt</b> <b>(string)</b> <b>(default</b> \033[0m)
       Format string of the box drawing characters enabled by the drawbox option.

   <b>cleaner</b> <b>(string)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>``)</b> <b>(not</b> <b>called</b> <b>if</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Set the path of a cleaner file.  The file should be executable.  This file is called if previewing is en‐
       abled, the previewer is set, and the previously selected file has its preview cache disabled.   The  fol‐
       lowing arguments are passed to the file, (1) current file name, (2) width, (3) height, (4) horizontal po‐
       sition,  (5) vertical position of preview pane and (6) next file name to be previewed respectively.  Pre‐
       view cleaning is disabled when the value of this option is left empty.

   <b>copyfmt</b> <b>(string)</b> <b>(default</b> \033[7;33m)
       Format string of the indicator for files to be copied.

   <b>cursoractivefmt</b> <b>(string)</b> <b>(default</b> \033[7m), cursorparentfmt string (default \033[7m), cursorpreviewfmt string
       (default \033[4m)
       Format strings for highlighting the cursor.  cursoractivefmt applies in the current directory pane,  cur‐
       sorparentfmt applies in panes that show parents of the current directory, and cursorpreviewfmt applies in
       panes that preview directories.

       The default is to make the active cursor and the parent directory cursor inverted.  The preview cursor is
       underlined.

       Some  other  possibilities  to consider for the preview or parent cursors: an empty string for no cursor,
       \033[7;2m for dimmed inverted text (visibility varies by terminal), \033[7;90m  for  inverted  text  with
       grey (aka "brightblack") background.

       If  the  format  string contains the characters %s, it is interpreted as a format string for fmt.Sprintf.
       Such a string should end with the terminal reset sequence.  For example, \033[4m%s\033[0m  has  the  same
       effect as \033[4m.

   <b>cutfmt</b> <b>(string)</b> <b>(default</b> \033[7;31m)
       Format string of the indicator for files to be cut.

   <b>dircache</b> <b>(bool)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>true)</b>
       Cache directory contents.

   <b>dircounts</b> <b>(bool)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>false)</b>
       When this option is enabled, directory sizes show the number of items inside instead of the total size of
       the directory, which needs to be calculated for each directory using calcdirsize.  This information needs
       to  be calculated by reading the directory and counting the items inside.  Therefore, this option is dis‐
       abled by default for performance reasons.  This option only has an effect when info has a size field  and
       the pane is wide enough to show the information.  999 items are counted per directory at most, and bigger
       directories are shown as 999+.

   <b>dirfirst</b> <b>(bool)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>true)</b>
       Show directories first above regular files.

   <b>dironly</b> <b>(bool)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>false)</b>
       Show only directories.

   <b>dirpreviews</b> <b>(bool)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>false)</b>
       If enabled, directories will also be passed to the previewer script.  This allows custom previews for di‐
       rectories.

   <b>drawbox</b> <b>(bool)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>false)</b>
       Draw boxes around panes with box drawing characters.

   <b>dupfilefmt</b> <b>(string)</b> <b>(default</b> %f.~%n~)
       Format  string  of  file  name  when  creating  duplicate files.  With the default format, copying a file
       abc.txt to the same directory will result in a duplicate file called abc.txt.~1~.  Special expansions are
       provided, %f as the file name, %b for the basename (file name without extension),  %e  as  the  extension
       (including the dot) and %n as the number of duplicates.

   <b>errorfmt</b> <b>(string)</b> <b>(default</b> \033[7;31;47m)
       Format string of error messages shown in the bottom message line.

       If  the  format  string contains the characters %s, it is interpreted as a format string for fmt.Sprintf.
       Such a string should end with the terminal reset sequence.  For example, \033[4m%s\033[0m  has  the  same
       effect as \033[4m.

   <b>filesep</b> <b>(string)</b> <b>(default</b> \n)
       File separator used in environment variables fs and fx.

   <b>findlen</b> <b>(int)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>1)</b>
       Number  of  characters  prompted for the find command.  When this value is set to 0, find command prompts
       until there is only a single match left.

   <b>globfilter</b> <b>(bool)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>false)</b>
       Patterns are treated as globs for the filter command, see globsearch for more details.

   <b>globsearch</b> <b>(bool)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>false)</b>
       When this option is enabled, search command patterns are considered as globs, otherwise, they are  liter‐
       als.  With globbing, * matches any sequence, ? matches any character, and [...] or [^...] matches charac‐
       ter sets or ranges.  Otherwise, these characters are interpreted as they are.

   <b>hidden</b> <b>(bool)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>false)</b>
       Show  hidden  files.   On Unix systems, hidden files are determined by the value of hiddenfiles.  On Win‐
       dows, files with hidden attributes are also considered hidden files.

   <b>hiddenfiles</b> <b>([]string)</b> <b>(default</b> .* for Unix and `` for Windows)
       List of hidden file glob patterns.  Patterns can be given as relative or absolute paths.   Globbing  sup‐
       ports  the  usual  special  characters,  *  to match any sequence, ? to match any character, and [...] or
       [^...] to match character sets or ranges.  In addition, if a pattern starts with !, then its matches  are
       excluded   from   hidden   files.    To   add   multiple  patterns,  use  :  as  a  separator.   Example:
       .*:lost+found:*.bak

   <b>history</b> <b>(bool)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>true)</b>
       Save command history.

   <b>icons</b> <b>(bool)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>false)</b>
       Show icons before each item in the list.

   <b>ifs</b> <b>(string)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>``)</b>
       Sets IFS variable in shell commands.  It works by adding the assignment to the beginning of  the  command
       string  as IFS=...; ....  The reason is that IFS variable is not inherited by the shell for security rea‐
       sons.  This method assumes a POSIX shell syntax so it can fail for non-POSIX shells.  This option has  no
       effect when the value is left empty.  This option does not have any effect on Windows.

   <b>ignorecase</b> <b>(bool)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>true)</b>
       Ignore case in sorting and search patterns.

   <b>ignoredia</b> <b>(bool)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>true)</b>
       Ignore diacritics in sorting and search patterns.

   <b>incsearch</b> <b>(bool)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>false)</b>
       Jump to the first match after each keystroke during searching.

   <b>incfilter</b> <b>(bool)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>false)</b>
       Apply filter pattern after each keystroke during filtering.

   <b>info</b> <b>([]string)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>``)</b>
       A  list  of  information that is shown for directory items at the right side of the pane.  Currently sup‐
       ported information types are size, time, atime, ctime, perm, user and group.  Information is  only  shown
       when the pane width is more than twice the width of information.

   <b>infotimefmtnew</b> <b>(string)</b> <b>(default</b> Jan _2 15:04)
       Format string of the file time shown in the info column when it matches this year.

   <b>infotimefmtold</b> <b>(string)</b> <b>(default</b> Jan _2 2006)
       Format string of the file time shown in the info column when it doesn't match this year.

   <b>locale</b> <b>(string)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>``)</b>
       An IETF BCP 47 language tag (e.g.  zh-CN) for specifying the locale used when using sort type natural and
       name.  An empty string means disable locale ordering, and the special value * is used to indicate reading
       the locale setting from the system environment.  This feature is currently experimental.

   <b>mouse</b> <b>(bool)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>false)</b>
       Send mouse events as input.

   <b>number</b> <b>(bool)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>false)</b>
       Show  the  position number for directory items on the left side of the pane.  When the relativenumber op‐
       tion is enabled, only the current line shows the absolute position and relative positions are  shown  for
       the rest.

   <b>numberfmt</b> <b>(string)</b> <b>(default</b> \033[33m)
       Format string of the position number for each line.

   <b>period</b> <b>(int)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>0)</b>
       Set the interval in seconds for periodic checks of directory updates.  This works by periodically calling
       the  load  command.   Note that directories are already updated automatically in many cases.  This option
       can be useful when there is an external process changing the displayed directory and you  are  not  doing
       anything in lf.  Periodic checks are disabled when the value of this option is set to zero.

   <b>preserve</b> <b>([]string)</b> <b>(default</b> mode)
       List  of attributes that are preserved when copying files.  Currently supported attributes are mode (i.a.
       access mode) and timestamps (i.e.  modification time and access time).  Note that  preserving  other  at‐
       tributes like ownership of change/birth timestamp is desirable, but not portably supported in Go.

   <b>preview</b> <b>(bool)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>true)</b>
       Show  previews  of files and directories at the rightmost pane.  If the file has more lines than the pre‐
       view pane, the rest of the lines are not read.  Files containing the null character (U+0000) in the  read
       portion are considered binary files and displayed as binary.

   <b>previewer</b> <b>(string)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>``)</b> <b>(not</b> <b>filtered</b> <b>if</b> <b>empty)</b>
       Set  the path of a previewer file to filter the content of regular files for previewing.  The file should
       be executable.  The following arguments are passed to the file, (1) current file  name,  (2)  width,  (3)
       height,  (4) horizontal position, and (5) vertical position of preview pane respectively.  SIGPIPE signal
       is sent when enough lines are read.  If the previewer returns a non-zero  exit  code,  then  the  preview
       cache  for  the  given file is disabled.  This means that if the file is selected in the future, the pre‐
       viewer is called once again.  Preview filtering is disabled and files are displayed as they are when  the
       value of this option is left empty.

   <b>promptfmt</b> <b>(string)</b> <b>(default</b> \033[32;1m%u@%h\033[0m:\033[34;1m%d\033[0m\033[1m%f\033[0m)
       Format string of the prompt shown in the top line.  Special expansions are provided, %u as the user name,
       %h as the hostname, %w as the working directory, %d as the working directory with a trailing path separa‐
       tor, %f as the file name, and %F as the current filter.  %S may be used once and will provide a spacer so
       that  the  following parts are right aligned on the screen.  The home folder is shown as ~ in the working
       directory expansion.  Directory names are automatically shortened to a single character starting from the
       leftmost parent when the prompt does not fit the screen.

   <b>ratios</b> <b>([]int)</b> <b>(default</b> 1:2:3)
       List of ratios of pane widths.  Number of items in the list determines the number of  panes  in  the  UI.
       When the preview option is enabled, the rightmost number is used for the width of the preview pane.

   <b>relativenumber</b> <b>(bool)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>false)</b>
       Show  the  position  number relative to the current line.  When number is enabled, the current line shows
       the absolute position, otherwise nothing is shown.

   <b>reverse</b> <b>(bool)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>false)</b>
       Reverse the direction of sort.

   <b>roundbox</b> <b>(bool)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>false)</b>
       Draw rounded outer corners when the drawbox option is enabled.

   <b>rulerfmt</b> <b>(string)</b> <b>(default</b>  %a| %p| \033[7;31m %m \033[0m| \033[7;33m  %c  \033[0m|  \033[7;35m  %s  \033[0m|
       \033[7;34m %f \033[0m| %i/%t)
       Format  string of the ruler shown in the bottom right corner.  Special expansions are provided, %a as the
       pressed keys, %p as the progress of file operations, %m as the number of files to be cut (moved),  %c  as
       the  number  of files to be copied, %s as the number of selected files, %f as the filter, %i as the posi‐
       tion of the cursor, %t as the number of files shown in the current directory, %h as the number  of  files
       hidden  in  the  current directory, and %d as the amount of free disk space remaining.  Additional expan‐
       sions  are  provided  for  environment  variables  exported  by  lf,  in  the  form  %{lf_&lt;name&gt;}   (e.g.
       %{lf_selmode}).   This  is  useful for displaying the current settings.  Expansions are also provided for
       user-defined options, in the form %{lf_user_&lt;name&gt;} (e.g.  %{lf_user_foo}).  The | character  splits  the
       format  string  into  sections.   Any section containing a failed expansion (result is a blank string) is
       discarded and not shown.

   <b>selectfmt</b> <b>(string)</b> <b>(default</b> \033[7;35m)
       Format string of the indicator for files that are selected.

   <b>selmode</b> <b>(string)</b> <b>(default</b> all)
       Selection mode for commands.  When set to all it will use the selected files from all directories.   When
       set to dir it will only use the selected files in the current directory.

   <b>scrolloff</b> <b>(int)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>0)</b>
       Minimum  number  of  offset  lines shown at all times at the top and bottom of the screen when scrolling.
       The current line is kept in the middle when this option is set to a large value that is bigger  than  the
       half of number of lines.  A smaller offset can be used when the current file is close to the beginning or
       end of the list to show the maximum number of items.

   <b>shell</b> <b>(string)</b> <b>(default</b> sh for Unix and cmd for Windows)
       Shell  executable  to  use  for shell commands.  Shell commands are executed as shell shellopts shellflag
       command -- arguments.

   <b>shellflag</b> <b>(string)</b> <b>(default</b> -c for Unix and /c for Windows)
       Command line flag used to pass shell commands.

   <b>shellopts</b> <b>([]string)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>``)</b>
       List of shell options to pass to the shell executable.

   <b>showbinds</b> <b>(bool)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>true)</b>
       Show bindings associated with pressed keys.

   <b>sixel</b> <b>(bool)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>false)</b>
       Render sixel images in preview.

   <b>smartcase</b> <b>(bool)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>true)</b>
       Override ignorecase option when the pattern contains an uppercase character.  This option has  no  effect
       when ignorecase is disabled.

   <b>smartdia</b> <b>(bool)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>false)</b>
       Override  ignoredia  option when the pattern contains a character with diacritic.  This option has no ef‐
       fect when ignoredia is disabled.

   <b>sortby</b> <b>(string)</b> <b>(default</b> natural)
       Sort type for directories.  Currently supported sort types are natural, name, size, time,  ctime,  atime,
       and ext.

   <b>statfmt</b> <b>(string)</b> <b>(default</b> \033[36m%p\033[0m| %c| %u| %g| %S| %t| -&gt; %l)
       Format  string  of the file info shown in the bottom left corner.  Special expansions are provided, %p as
       the file permissions, %c as the link count, %u as the user, %g as the group, %s as the file size,  %S  as
       the  file  size but with a fixed width of four characters (left-padded with spaces), %t as the last modi‐
       fied time, and %l as the link target.  The | character splits the format string into sections.  Any  sec‐
       tion containing a failed expansion (result is a blank string) is discarded and not shown.

   <b>tabstop</b> <b>(int)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>8)</b>
       Number of space characters to show for horizontal tabulation (U+0009) character.

   <b>tagfmt</b> <b>(string)</b> <b>(default</b> \033[31m)
       Format string of the tags.

       If  the  format  string contains the characters %s, it is interpreted as a format string for fmt.Sprintf.
       Such a string should end with the terminal reset sequence.  For example, \033[4m%s\033[0m  has  the  same
       effect as \033[4m.

   <b>tempmarks</b> <b>(string)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>``)</b>
       Marks  to be considered temporary (e.g.  abc refers to marks a, b, and c).  These marks are not synced to
       other clients and they are not saved in the bookmarks file.  Note that the special bookmark `  is  always
       treated as temporary and it does not need to be specified.

   <b>timefmt</b> <b>(string)</b> <b>(default</b> Mon Jan _2 15:04:05 2006)
       Format string of the file modification time shown in the bottom line.

   <b>truncatechar</b> <b>(string)</b> <b>(default</b> ~)
       The truncate character that is shown at the end when the file name does not fit into the pane.

   <b>truncatepct</b> <b>(int)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>100)</b>
       When  a  filename is too long to be shown completely, the available space is partitioned into two pieces.
       truncatepct defines a fraction (in percent between 0 and 100) for the size of the first piece, which will
       show the beginning of the filename.  The second piece will show the end of the filename and will use  the
       rest  of  the  available space.  Both pieces are separated by the truncation character (truncatechar).  A
       value of 100 will only show the beginning of the filename, while a value of 0 will only show the  end  of
       the filename, e.g.:

       • set truncatepct 100 -&gt; very-long-filename-tr~ (default)

       • set truncatepct 50 -&gt; very-long-f~-truncated

       • set truncatepct 0 -&gt; ~ng-filename-truncated

   <b>waitmsg</b> <b>(string)</b> <b>(default</b> Press any key to continue)
       String shown after commands of shell-wait type.

   <b>watch</b> <b>(bool)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>false)</b>
       Watch  the filesystem for changes using fsnotify to automatically refresh file information.  FUSE is cur‐
       rently not supported due to limitations in fsnotify.

   <b>wrapscan</b> <b>(bool)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>true)</b>
       Searching can wrap around the file list.

   <b>wrapscroll</b> <b>(bool)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>false)</b>
       Scrolling can wrap around the file list.

   <b>user_{option}</b> <b>(string)</b> <b>(default</b> <b>none)</b>
       Any option that is prefixed with user_ is a user-defined option and can be set to any string.   Inside  a
       user-defined command, the value will be provided in the lf_user_{option} environment variable.  These op‐
       tions are not used by lf and are not persisted.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  variables are exported for shell commands: These are referred to with a $ prefix on POSIX
       shells (e.g.  $f), between % characters on Windows cmd (e.g.  %f%), and with a $env:  prefix  on  Windows
       PowerShell (e.g.  $env:f).

   <b>f</b>
       Current file selection as a full path.

   <b>fs</b>
       Selected file(s) separated with the value of filesep option as full path(s).

   <b>fx</b>
       Selected file(s) (i.e.  fs) if there are any selected files, otherwise current file selection (i.e.  f).

   <b>id</b>
       Id of the running client.

   <b>PWD</b>
       Present working directory.

   <b>OLDPWD</b>
       Initial working directory.

   <b>LF_LEVEL</b>
       The  value  of this variable is set to the current nesting level when you run lf from a shell spawned in‐
       side lf.  You can add the value of this variable to your shell prompt to make it clear  that  your  shell
       runs  inside lf.  For example, with POSIX shells, you can use [ -n "$LF_LEVEL" ] &amp;&amp; PS1="$PS1""(lf level:
       $LF_LEVEL) " in your shell configuration file (e.g.  <a href="file:~/.bashrc">~/.bashrc</a>).

   <b>OPENER</b>
       If this variable is set in the environment, use the same value.  Otherwise, this is set to start in  Win‐
       dows, open in MacOS, xdg-open in others.

   <b>EDITOR</b>
       If VISUAL is set in the environment, use its value.  Otherwise, use the value of the environment variable
       EDITOR.  If neither variable is set, this is set to vi on Unix, notepad in Windows.

   <b>PAGER</b>
       If  this variable is set in the environment, use the same value.  Otherwise, this is set to less on Unix,
       more in Windows.

   <b>SHELL</b>
       If this variable is set in the environment, use the same value.  Otherwise, this is set to  sh  on  Unix,
       cmd in Windows.

   <b>lf</b>
       Absolute  path  to  the  currently  running lf binary, if it can be found.  Otherwise, this is set to the
       string lf.

   <b>lf_{option}</b>
       Value of the {option}.

   <b>lf_user_{option}</b>
       Value of the user_{option}.

   <b>lf_width,</b> <b>lf_height</b>
       Width/Height of the terminal.

   <b>lf_count</b>
       Value of the count associated with the current command.

   <b>lf_mode</b>
       Current mode that lf is operating in.  This is useful for customizing keybindings depending on  what  the
       current  mode  is.   Possible values are delete, rename, filter, find, mark, search, command, shell, pipe
       (when running a shell-pipe command), normal, and unknown.

</pre><h4><b>SPECIAL</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       This section shows information about special shell commands.

   <b>open</b>
       This shell command can be defined to override the default open command when the current file is not a di‐
       rectory.

   <b>paste</b>
       This shell command can be defined to override the default paste command.

   <b>rename</b>
       This shell command can be defined to override the default rename command.

   <b>delete</b>
       This shell command can be defined to override the default delete command.

   <b>pre-cd</b>
       This shell command can be defined to be executed before changing a directory.

   <b>on-cd</b>
       This shell command can be defined to be executed after changing a directory.

   <b>on-focus-gained</b>
       This shell command can be defined to be executed when the terminal gains focus.

   <b>on-focus-lost</b>
       This shell command can be defined to be executed when the terminal loses focus.

   <b>on-init</b>
       This shell command can be defined to be executed after initializing and connecting to the server.

   <b>on-select</b>
       This shell command can be defined to be executed after the selection changes.

   <b>on-redraw</b>
       This shell command can be defined to be executed after the screen is redrawn or if the  terminal  is  re‐
       sized.

   <b>on-quit</b>
       This shell command can be defined to be executed before quitting.

</pre><h4><b>PREFIXES</b></h4><pre>
       The following command prefixes are used by lf:

              :  read (default)  builtin/custom command
              $  shell           shell command
              %  shell-pipe      shell command running with the UI
              !  shell-wait      shell command waiting for a key press
              &amp;  shell-async     shell command running asynchronously

       The  same  evaluator  is used for the command line and the configuration file for reading shell commands.
       The difference is that prefixes are not necessary in the command line.  Instead, different modes are pro‐
       vided to read corresponding commands.  These modes are mapped to the prefix keys above by default.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       Characters from # to newline are comments and ignored:

              # comments start with `#`

       There are five special commands (set, setlocal, map, cmap, and cmd) for configuration.

       Command set is used to set an option which can be a boolean, integer, or string:

              set hidden         # boolean enable
              set hidden true    # boolean enable
              set nohidden       # boolean disable
              set hidden false   # boolean disable
              set hidden!        # boolean toggle
              set scrolloff 10   # integer value
              set sortby time    # string value w/o quotes
              set sortby 'time'  # string value with single quotes (whitespaces)
              set sortby "time"  # string value with double quotes (backslash escapes)

       Command setlocal is used to set a local option for a directory which can be a boolean  or  string.   Cur‐
       rently supported local options are dirfirst, dironly, hidden, info, reverse, sortby and locale.  Adding a
       trailing  path  separator  (i.e.   /  for Unix and \ for Windows) sets the option for the given directory
       along with its subdirectories:

              setlocal /foo/bar hidden         # boolean enable
              setlocal /foo/bar hidden true    # boolean enable
              setlocal /foo/bar nohidden       # boolean disable
              setlocal /foo/bar hidden false   # boolean disable
              setlocal /foo/bar hidden!        # boolean toggle
              setlocal /foo/bar sortby time    # string value w/o quotes
              setlocal /foo/bar sortby 'time'  # string value with single quotes (whitespaces)
              setlocal /foo/bar sortby "time"  # string value with double quotes (backslash escapes)
              setlocal /foo/bar  hidden        # for only '/foo/bar' directory
              setlocal /foo/bar/ hidden        # for '/foo/bar' and its subdirectories (e.g. '/foo/bar/baz')

       Command 'map' is used to bind a key to a command which can be a builtin command, custom command, or shell
       command:

              map gh cd ~        # builtin command
              map D trash        # custom command
              map i $less $f     # shell command
              map U !du -csh *   # waiting shell command

       Command 'cmap' is used to bind a key on the command line to a command line command or any other command:

              cmap &lt;c-g&gt; cmd-escape
              cmap &lt;a-i&gt; set incsearch!

       You can delete an existing binding by leaving the expression empty:

              map gh             # deletes 'gh' mapping
              cmap &lt;c-g&gt;         # deletes '&lt;c-g&gt;' mapping

       Command cmd is used to define a custom command:

              cmd usage $du -h -d1 | less

       You can delete an existing command by leaving the expression empty:

              cmd trash          # deletes 'trash' command

       If there is no prefix then : is assumed:

              map zt set info time

       An explicit : can be provided to group statements until a newline which is especially useful for map  and
       cmd commands:

              map st :set sortby time; set info time

       If you need multiline you can wrap statements in {{ and }} after the proper prefix.

              map st :{{
                  set sortby time
                  set info time
              }}

</pre><h4><b>KEY</b> <b>MAPPINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Regular keys are assigned to a command with the usual syntax:

              map a down

       Keys combined with the shift key simply use the uppercase letter:

              map A down

       Special keys are written in between &lt; and &gt; characters and always use lowercase letters:

              map &lt;enter&gt; down

       Angle brackets can be assigned with their special names:

              map &lt;lt&gt; down
              map &lt;gt&gt; down

       Function keys are prefixed with f character:

              map &lt;f-1&gt; down

       Keys combined with the control key are prefixed with a c character:

              map &lt;c-a&gt; down

       Keys  combined with the alt key are assigned in two different ways depending on the behavior of your ter‐
       minal.  Older terminals (e.g.  xterm) may set the 8th bit of a character when the alt key is pressed.  On
       these terminals, you can use the corresponding byte for the mapping:

              map á down

       Newer terminals (e.g.  gnome-terminal) may prefix the key with an escape key when the alt key is pressed.
       lf uses the escape delaying mechanism to recognize alt keys in these  terminals  (delay  is  100ms).   On
       these terminals, keys combined with the alt key are prefixed with an a character:

              map &lt;a-a&gt; down

       It is possible to combine special keys with modifiers:

              map &lt;a-enter&gt; down

       WARNING: Some key combinations will likely be intercepted by your OS, window manager, or terminal.  Other
       key combinations cannot be recognized by lf due to the way terminals work (e.g.  Ctrl+h combination sends
       a  backspace key instead).  The easiest way to find out the name of a key combination and whether it will
       work on your system is to press the key while lf is running and read the name from  the  unknown  mapping
       error.

       Mouse buttons are prefixed with an m character:

              map &lt;m-right&gt; down

</pre><h4><b>PUSH</b> <b>MAPPINGS</b></h4><pre>
       The usual way to map a key sequence is to assign it to a named or unnamed command.  While this provides a
       clean  way  to remap built-in keys as well as other commands, it can be limiting at times.  For this rea‐
       son, the push command is provided by lf.  This command is used to simulate key pushes given as its  argu‐
       ments.  You can map a key to a push command with an argument to create various keybindings.

       This is mainly useful for two purposes.  First, it can be used to map a command with a command count:

              map &lt;c-j&gt; push 10j

       Second, it can be used to avoid typing the name when a command takes arguments:

              map r push :rename&lt;space&gt;

       One  thing to be careful of is that since the push command works with keys instead of commands it is pos‐
       sible to accidentally create recursive bindings:

              map j push 2j

       These types of bindings create a deadlock when executed.

</pre><h4><b>SHELL</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       Regular shell commands are the most basic command type that is useful for many purposes.  For example, we
       can write a shell command to move the selected file(s) to trash.  A first attempt to write such a command
       may look like this:

              cmd trash ${{
                  mkdir -p <a href="file:~/.trash">~/.trash</a>
                  if [ -z "$fs" ]; then
                      mv "$f" <a href="file:~/.trash">~/.trash</a>
                  else
                      IFS="$(printf '\n\t')"; mv $fs <a href="file:~/.trash">~/.trash</a>
                  fi
              }}

       We check $fs to see if there are any selected files.  Otherwise, we just delete the current file.   Since
       this  is such a common pattern, a separate $fx variable is provided.  We can use this variable to get rid
       of the conditional:

              cmd trash ${{
                  mkdir -p <a href="file:~/.trash">~/.trash</a>
                  IFS="$(printf '\n\t')"; mv $fx <a href="file:~/.trash">~/.trash</a>
              }}

       The trash directory is checked each time the command is executed.  We can move it outside of the  command
       so it would only run once at startup:

              ${{ mkdir -p <a href="file:~/.trash">~/.trash</a> }}

              cmd trash ${{ IFS="$(printf '\n\t')"; mv $fx <a href="file:~/.trash">~/.trash</a> }}

       Since these are one-liners, we can drop {{ and }}:

              $mkdir -p <a href="file:~/.trash">~/.trash</a>

              cmd trash $IFS="$(printf '\n\t')"; mv $fx <a href="file:~/.trash">~/.trash</a>

       Finally, note that we set the IFS variable manually in these commands.  Instead, we could use the ifs op‐
       tion  to  set it for all shell commands (i.e.  set ifs "\n").  This can be especially useful for interac‐
       tive use (e.g.  $rm $f or $rm $fs would simply work).  This option is not set by default as it can behave
       unexpectedly for new users.  However, use of this option is highly recommended and it is assumed  in  the
       rest of the documentation.

</pre><h4><b>PIPING</b> <b>SHELL</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       Regular shell commands have some limitations in some cases.  When an output or error message is given and
       the  command exits afterwards, the ui is immediately resumed and there is no way to see the message with‐
       out dropping to shell again.  Also, even when there is no output or error,  the  UI  still  needs  to  be
       paused while the command is running.  This can cause flickering on the screen for short commands and sim‐
       ilar distractions for longer commands.

       Instead  of pausing the UI, piping shell commands connect stdin, stdout, and stderr of the command to the
       statline at the bottom of the UI.  This can be useful for programs following the Unix philosophy to  give
       no output in the success case, and brief error messages or prompts in other cases.

       For  example, following rename command prompts for overwrite in the statline if there is an existing file
       with the given name:

              cmd rename %mv -i $f $1

       You can also output error messages in the command and it will show up in the statline.  For  example,  an
       alternative rename command may look like this:

              cmd rename %[ -e $1 ] &amp;&amp; printf "file exists" || mv $f $1

       Note that input is line buffered and output and error are byte buffered.

</pre><h4><b>WAITING</b> <b>SHELL</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       Waiting  shell  commands are similar to regular shell commands except that they wait for a key press when
       the command is finished.  These can be useful to see the output of a program before the  UI  is  resumed.
       Waiting  shell  commands  are more appropriate than piping shell commands when the command is verbose and
       the output is best displayed as multiline.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>SHELL</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       Asynchronous shell commands are used to start a command in the background and then resume operation with‐
       out waiting for the command to finish.  Stdin, stdout, and stderr of the command are neither connected to
       the terminal nor the UI.

</pre><h4><b>REMOTE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       One of the more advanced features in lf is remote commands.  All clients connect to a server on  startup.
       It  is  possible to send commands to all or any of the connected clients over the common server.  This is
       used internally to notify file selection changes to other clients.

       To use this feature, you need to use a client which supports communicating with  a  Unix  domain  socket.
       OpenBSD implementation of netcat (nc) is one such example.  You can use it to send a command to the sock‐
       et file:

              echo 'send echo hello world' | nc -U ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>}/lf.${USER}.sock

       Since such a client may not be available everywhere, lf comes bundled with a command line flag to be used
       as  such.   When using lf, you do not need to specify the address of the socket file.  This is the recom‐
       mended way of using remote commands since it is shorter and immune to socket file address changes:

              lf -remote 'send echo hello world'

       In this command send is used to send the rest of the string as a command to all connected  clients.   You
       can optionally give it an ID number to send a command to a single client:

              lf -remote 'send 1234 echo hello world'

       All clients have a unique id number but you may not be aware of the id number when you are writing a com‐
       mand.  For this purpose, an $id variable is exported to the environment for shell commands.  The value of
       this  variable  is  set  to the process ID of the client.  You can use it to send a remote command from a
       client to the server which in return sends a command back to itself.  So now you can display a message in
       the current client by calling the following in a shell command:

              lf -remote "send $id echo hello world"

       Since lf does not have control flow syntax, remote commands are used for such needs.   For  example,  you
       can configure the number of columns in the UI with respect to the terminal width as follows:

              cmd recol %{{
                  if [ $lf_width -le 80 ]; then
                      lf -remote "send $id set ratios 1:2"
                  elif [ $lf_width -le 160 ]; then
                      lf -remote "send $id set ratios 1:2:3"
                  else
                      lf -remote "send $id set ratios 1:2:3:5"
                  fi
              }}

       In  addition, the query command can be used to obtain information about a specific lf instance by provid‐
       ing its id:

              lf -remote "query $id maps"

       The following types of information are supported:

              maps     list of mappings created by the 'map' command
              cmaps    list of mappings created by the 'cmap' command
              cmds     list of commands created by the 'cmd' command
              jumps    contents of the jump list, showing previously visited locations
              history  list of previously executed commands on the command line

       This is useful for scripting actions based on the internal state of lf.  For example, to select a  previ‐
       ous command using fzf and execute it:

              map &lt;a-h&gt; ${{
                  clear
                  cmd=$(
                      lf -remote "query $id history" |
                      awk -F'\t' 'NR &gt; 1 { print $NF}' |
                      sort -u |
                      fzf --reverse --prompt='Execute command: '
                  )
                  lf -remote "send $id $cmd"
              }}

       There  is  also  a  quit command to quit the server when there are no connected clients left, and a quit!
       command to force quit the server by closing client connections first:

              lf -remote 'quit'
              lf -remote 'quit!'

       Lastly, there is a conn command to connect the server to a client.  This should not be needed for users.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>OPERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       lf uses its own built-in copy and move operations by default.  These are implemented as asynchronous  op‐
       erations  and  progress  is shown in the bottom ruler.  These commands do not overwrite existing files or
       directories with the same name.  Instead, a suffix that is compatible with the  --backup=numbered  option
       in  GNU  cp  is added to the new files or directories.  Only file modes and (some) timestamps can be pre‐
       served (see preserve option), all other attributes are ignored including ownership, context,  and  xattr.
       Special files such as character and block devices, named pipes, and sockets are skipped and links are not
       followed.  Moving is performed using the rename operation of the underlying OS.  For cross-device moving,
       lf  falls  back  to copying and then deletes the original files if there are no errors.  Operation errors
       are shown in the message line as well as the log file and they do not preemptively finish the correspond‐
       ing file operation.

       File operations can be performed on the currently selected file or on multiple files  by  selecting  them
       first.  When you copy a file, lf doesn't actually copy the file on the disk, but only records its name to
       a file.  The actual file copying takes place when you paste.  Similarly paste after a cut operation moves
       the file.

       You  can  customize copy and move operations by defining a paste command.  This is a special command that
       is called when it is defined instead of the built-in implementation.  You can use the  following  example
       as a starting point:

              cmd paste %{{
                  load=$(cat <a href="file:~/.local/share/lf/files">~/.local/share/lf/files</a>)
                  mode=$(echo "$load" | sed -n '1p')
                  list=$(echo "$load" | sed '1d')
                  if [ $mode = 'copy' ]; then
                      cp -R $list .
                  elif [ $mode = 'move' ]; then
                      mv $list .
                      rm <a href="file:~/.local/share/lf/files">~/.local/share/lf/files</a>
                      lf -remote 'send clear'
                  fi
              }}

       Some  useful things to be considered are to use the backup (--backup) and/or preserve attributes (-a) op‐
       tions with cp and mv commands if they support it (i.e.  GNU implementation), change the command  type  to
       asynchronous,  or  use  rsync  command  with progress bar option for copying and feed the progress to the
       client periodically with remote echo calls.

       By default, lf does not assign delete command to a key to protect new  users.   You  can  customize  file
       deletion  by defining a delete command.  You can also assign a key to this command if you like.  An exam‐
       ple command to move selected files to a trash folder and remove files completely after a prompt  is  pro‐
       vided in the example configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>SEARCHING</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  two mechanisms implemented in lf to search a file in the current directory.  Searching is the
       traditional method to move the selection to a file matching a given pattern.  Finding is  an  alternative
       way to search for a pattern possibly using fewer keystrokes.

       The searching mechanism is implemented with commands search (default /), search-back (default ?), search-
       next  (default  n),  and  search-prev (default N).  You can enable globsearch option to match with a glob
       pattern.  Globbing supports * to match any sequence, ? to match any character, and  [...]  or  [^...]  to
       match  character  sets  or  ranges.  You can enable incsearch option to jump to the current match at each
       keystroke while typing.  In this mode, you can either use cmd-enter to accept the search or  use  cmd-es‐
       cape  to cancel the search.  You can also map some other commands with cmap to accept the search and exe‐
       cute the command immediately afterwards.  For example, you can use the right  arrow  key  to  finish  the
       search and open the selected file with the following mapping:

              cmap &lt;right&gt; :cmd-enter; open

       The  finding  mechanism  is  implemented with commands find (default f), find-back (default F), find-next
       (default ;), find-prev (default ,).  You can disable anchorfind option to match a pattern at an arbitrary
       position in the filename instead of the beginning.  You can set the number of keys to match using findlen
       option.  If you set this value to zero, then the keys are read until there is only a single  match.   The
       default values of these two options are set to jump to the first file with the given initial.

       Some options effect both searching and finding.  You can disable wrapscan option to prevent searches from
       being  wrapped  around  at the end of the file list.  You can disable ignorecase option to match cases in
       the pattern and the filename.  This option is already automatically overridden if  the  pattern  contains
       upper-case  characters.   You can disable smartcase option to disable this behavior.  Two similar options
       ignoredia and smartdia are provided to control matching diacritics in Latin letters.

</pre><h4><b>OPENING</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       You can define an open command (default l and &lt;right&gt;) to configure file opening.  This command  is  only
       called  when  the  current file is not a directory, otherwise, the directory is entered instead.  You can
       define it just as you would define any other command:

              cmd open $vi $fx

       It is possible to use different command types:

              cmd open &amp;xdg-open $f

       You may want to use either file extensions or mime types from file command:

              cmd open ${{
                  case $(file --mime-type -Lb $f) in
                      text/*) vi $fx;;
                      *) for f in $fx; do xdg-open $f &gt; /dev/null 2&gt; /dev/null &amp; done;;
                  esac
              }}

       You may want to use setsid before your opener command to have persistent processes that continue  to  run
       after lf quits.

       Regular shell commands (i.e.  $) drop to the terminal which results in a flicker for commands that finish
       immediately  (e.g.  xdg-open in the above example).  If you want to use asynchronous shell commands (i.e.
       &amp;) but also want to use the terminal when necessary (e.g.  vi in the above example), you can use a remote
       command:

              cmd open &amp;{{
                  case $(file --mime-type -Lb $f) in
                      text/*) lf -remote "send $id \$vi \$fx";;
                      *) for f in $fx; do xdg-open $f &gt; /dev/null 2&gt; /dev/null &amp; done;;
                  esac
              }}

       Note that asynchronous shell commands run in their own process group by default so they  do  not  require
       the manual use of setsid.

       The following command is provided by default:

              cmd open &amp;$OPENER $f

       You may also use any other existing file openers as you like.  Possible options are libfile-mimeinfo-perl
       (executable name is mimeopen), rifle (ranger's default file opener), or mimeo to name a few.

</pre><h4><b>PREVIEWING</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       lf  previews  files  on  the preview pane by printing the file until the end or until the preview pane is
       filled.  This output can be enhanced by providing a custom preview script for  filtering.   This  can  be
       used  to highlight source codes, list contents of archive files or view PDF or image files to name a few.
       For coloring lf recognizes ANSI escape codes.

       To use this feature, you need to set the value of previewer option to the path  of  an  executable  file.
       Five arguments are passed to the file, (1) current file name, (2) width, (3) height, (4) horizontal posi‐
       tion,  and (5) vertical position of preview pane respectively.  The output of the execution is printed in
       the preview pane.  You may also want to use the same script in your pager mapping as well:

              set previewer <a href="file:~/.config/lf/pv.sh">~/.config/lf/pv.sh</a>
              map i $<a href="file:~/.config/lf/pv.sh">~/.config/lf/pv.sh</a> $f | less -R

       For less pager, you may instead utilize LESSOPEN mechanism so that useful information about the file such
       as the full path of the file can still be displayed in the statusline below:

              set previewer <a href="file:~/.config/lf/pv.sh">~/.config/lf/pv.sh</a>
              map i $LESSOPEN='| <a href="file:~/.config/lf/pv.sh">~/.config/lf/pv.sh</a> %s' less -R $f

       Since this script is called for each file selection change it needs to be as efficient  as  possible  and
       this  responsibility is left to the user.  You may use file extensions to determine the type of file more
       efficiently compared to obtaining mime types from file command.  Extensions can then  be  used  to  match
       cleanly within a conditional:

              #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>

              case "$1" in
                  *.tar*) tar tf "$1";;
                  *.zip) unzip -l "$1";;
                  *.rar) unrar l "$1";;
                  *.7z) 7z l "$1";;
                  *.pdf) pdftotext "$1" -;;
                  *) highlight -O ansi "$1";;
              esac

       Another  important  consideration for efficiency is the use of programs with short startup times for pre‐
       view.  For this reason, highlight is recommended over pygmentize for syntax highlighting.  Besides, it is
       also important that the application processes the file on the fly rather than first  reading  it  to  the
       memory and then doing the processing afterwards.  This is especially relevant for big files.  lf automat‐
       ically  closes  the  previewer script output pipe with a SIGPIPE when enough lines are read.  When every‐
       thing else fails, you can make use of the height argument to only feed the first portion of the file to a
       program for preview.  Note that some programs may not respond well to SIGPIPE to exit with a non-zero re‐
       turn code and avoid caching.  You may add a trailing || true command to avoid such errors:

              highlight -O ansi "$1" || true

       You may also use an existing preview filter as you like.  Your system may already  come  with  a  preview
       filter  named  lesspipe.  These filters may have a mechanism to add user customizations as well.  See the
       related documentation for more information.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGING</b> <b>DIRECTORY</b></h4><pre>
       lf changes the working directory of the process to the current directory so that  shell  commands  always
       work  in the displayed directory.  After quitting, it returns to the original directory where it is first
       launched like all shell programs.  If you want to stay in the current directory after quitting,  you  can
       use   one   of   the   example   lfcd   wrapper   shell   scripts   provided   in   the   repository   at
       &lt;https://github.com/gokcehan/lf/tree/master/etc&gt;

       There is a special command on-cd that runs a shell command when  it  is  defined  and  the  directory  is
       changed.  You can define it just as you would define any other command:

              cmd on-cd &amp;{{
                  bash -c '
                  # display git repository status in your prompt
                  source /usr/share/git/completion/git-prompt.sh
                  GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE=auto
                  GIT_PS1_SHOWSTASHSTATE=auto
                  GIT_PS1_SHOWUNTRACKEDFILES=auto
                  GIT_PS1_SHOWUPSTREAM=auto
                  git=$(__git_ps1 " (%s)")
                  fmt="\033[32;1m%u@%h\033[0m:\033[34;1m%d\033[0m\033[1m%f$git\033[0m"
                  lf -remote "send $id set promptfmt \"$fmt\""
                  '
              }}

       If  you want to print escape sequences, you may redirect printf output to /dev/tty.  The following xterm-
       specific escape sequence sets the terminal title to the working directory:

              cmd on-cd &amp;{{
                  printf "\033]0; $PWD\007" &gt; /dev/tty
              }}

       This command runs whenever you change the directory but not on startup.  You can add  an  extra  call  to
       make it run on startup as well:

              cmd on-cd &amp;{{ ... }}
              on-cd

       Note  that  all  shell  commands are possible but % and &amp; are usually more appropriate as $ and !  causes
       flickers and pauses respectively.

       There is also a pre-cd command, that works like on-cd, but  is  run  before  the  directory  is  actually
       changed.

</pre><h4><b>COLORS</b></h4><pre>
       lf tries to automatically adapt its colors to the environment.  It starts with a default color scheme and
       updates  colors  using values of existing environment variables possibly by overwriting its previous val‐
       ues.  Colors are set in the following order:

       1. default

       2. LSCOLORS (Mac/BSD ls)

       3. LS_COLORS (GNU ls)

       4. LF_COLORS (lf specific)

       5. colors file (lf specific)

       Please refer to the corresponding man pages for more information about LSCOLORS and LS_COLORS.  LF_COLORS
       is provided with the same syntax as LS_COLORS in case you want to configure colors only for  lf  but  not
       ls.   This can be useful since there are some differences between ls and lf, though one should expect the
       same  behavior  for  common   cases.    The   colors   file   (refer   to   the   CONFIGURATION   section
       (https://github.com/gokcehan/lf/blob/master/doc.md#configuration))  is  provided for easier configuration
       without environment variables.  This file should consist of whitespace-separated pairs with a # character
       to start comments until the end of the line.

       You can configure lf colors in two different ways.  First, you can only configure 8 basic colors used  by
       your  terminal  and lf should pick up those colors automatically.  Depending on your terminal, you should
       be able to select your colors from a 24-bit palette.  This is the recommended approach as colors used  by
       other programs will also match each other.

       Second,  you  can set the values of environment variables or colors file mentioned above for fine-grained
       customization.  Note that LS_COLORS/LF_COLORS are more powerful than LSCOLORS and they can be  used  even
       when  GNU  programs  are  not installed on the system.  You can combine this second method with the first
       method for the best results.

       Lastly, you may also want to configure the colors of the prompt line to match the  rest  of  the  colors.
       Colors of the prompt line can be configured using the promptfmt option which can include hardcoded colors
       as ANSI escapes.  See the default value of this option to have an idea about how to color this line.

       It is worth noting that lf uses as many colors advertised by your terminal's entry in terminfo or infocmp
       databases  on  your  system.  If an entry is not present, it falls back to an internal database.  If your
       terminal supports 24-bit colors but either does not have a database entry or does not advertise all capa‐
       bilities, you can enable support by setting the $COLORTERM variable to truecolor or ensuring $TERM is set
       to a value that ends with -truecolor.

       Default lf colors are mostly taken from GNU dircolors defaults.  These defaults use 8  basic  colors  and
       bold  attribute.  Default dircolors entries with background colors are simplified to avoid confusion with
       current file selection in lf.  Similarly, there are only file type matchings and extension matchings  are
       left out for simplicity.  Default values are as follows given with their matching order in lf:

              ln  01;36
              or  31;01
              tw  01;34
              ow  01;34
              st  01;34
              di  01;34
              pi  33
              so  01;35
              bd  33;01
              cd  33;01
              su  01;32
              sg  01;32
              ex  01;32
              fi  00

       Note that lf first tries matching file names and then falls back to file types.  The full order of match‐
       ings from most specific to least are as follows:

       1. Full Path (e.g.  <a href="file:~/.config/lf/lfrc">~/.config/lf/lfrc</a>)

       2. Dir Name (e.g.  .git/) (only matches dirs with a trailing slash at the end)

       3. File Type (e.g.  ln) (except fi)

       4. File Name (e.g.  README*)

       5. File Name (e.g.  *README)

       6. Base Name (e.g.  README.*)

       7. Extension (e.g.  *.txt)

       8. Default (i.e.  fi)

       For example, given a regular text file /path/to/README.txt, the following entries are checked in the con‐
       figuration and the first one to match is used:

       1. /path/to/README.txt

       2. (skipped since the file is not a directory)

       3. (skipped since the file is of type fi)

       4. README.txt*

       5. *README.txt

       6. README.*

       7. *.txt

       8. fi

       Given  a regular directory /path/to/example.d, the following entries are checked in the configuration and
       the first one to match is used:

       1. /path/to/example.d

       2. example.d/

       3. di

       4. example.d*

       5. *example.d

       6. example.*

       7. *.d

       8. fi

       Note that glob-like patterns do not perform glob matching for performance reasons.

       For example, you can set a variable as follows:

              export LF_COLORS="<a href="file:~/Documents">~/Documents</a>=01;31:<a href="file:~/Downloads">~/Downloads</a>=01;31:<a href="file:~/.local/share">~/.local/share</a>=01;31:<a href="file:~/.config/lf/lfrc">~/.config/lf/lfrc</a>=31:.git/=01;32:.git*=32:*.gitignore=32:*Makefile=32:README.*=33:*.txt=34:*.md=34:ln=01;36:di=01;34:ex=01;32:"

       Having all entries on a single line can make it hard to read.  You may instead divide  it  into  multiple
       lines in between double quotes by escaping newlines with backslashes as follows:

              export LF_COLORS="\
              <a href="file:~/Documents">~/Documents</a>=01;31:\
              <a href="file:~/Downloads">~/Downloads</a>=01;31:\
              <a href="file:~/.local/share">~/.local/share</a>=01;31:\
              <a href="file:~/.config/lf/lfrc">~/.config/lf/lfrc</a>=31:\
              .git/=01;32:\
              .git*=32:\
              *.gitignore=32:\
              *Makefile=32:\
              README.*=33:\
              *.txt=34:\
              *.md=34:\
              ln=01;36:\
              di=01;34:\
              ex=01;32:\
              "

       The  ln  entry supports the special value target, which will use the link target to select a style.  File
       name rules will still apply based on the link's name -- this mirrors GNU's  ls  and  dircolors  behavior.
       Having  such  a long variable definition in a shell configuration file might be undesirable.  You may in‐
       stead use the colors file (refer to the CONFIGURATION  section  (https://github.com/gokcehan/lf/blob/mas‐
       ter/doc.md#configuration))    for    configuration.    A   sample   colors   file   can   be   found   at
       &lt;https://github.com/gokcehan/lf/blob/master/etc/colors.example&gt; You may also see the wiki page  for  ANSI
       escape codes &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code&gt;

</pre><h4><b>ICONS</b></h4><pre>
       Icons  are  configured  using  LF_ICONS environment variable or an icons file (refer to the CONFIGURATION
       section (https://github.com/gokcehan/lf/blob/master/doc.md#configuration)).  The variable uses  the  same
       syntax  as  LS_COLORS/LF_COLORS.   Instead of colors, you should put a single characters as values of en‐
       tries.  The ln entry supports the special value target, which will use the link target to select a  icon.
       File  name  rules will still apply based on the link's name -- this mirrors GNU's ls and dircolors behav‐
       ior.  The icons  file  (refer  to  the  CONFIGURATION  section  (https://github.com/gokcehan/lf/blob/mas‐
       ter/doc.md#configuration)) should consist of whitespace-separated arrays with a # character to start com‐
       ments until the end of the line.  Each line should contain 1-3 columns, first column is filetype or file‐
       name  pattern,  second  column is the icon, third column is an optional icon color.  If there is only one
       column, means to disable rule for this filetype or pattern.  Do not forget to add set icons true to  your
       lfrc to see the icons.  Default values are as follows given with their matching order in lf:

              ln  l
              or  l
              tw  t
              ow  d
              st  t
              di  d
              pi  p
              so  s
              bd  b
              cd  c
              su  u
              sg  g
              ex  x
              fi  -
