</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       vtprint - print files from UNIX host to printer attached to local terminal

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vtprint</b> [ <b>-bBcCdDeEfFhlnNqQtvw</b> ] [ <b>-L</b> <u>vtprintcap</u> ] [ <b>-T</b> <u>termtype</u> ] [ <b>-V</b> <u>device</u> ] [ <u>filename...</u>  ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vtprint</b>  is  a  simple  filter  that  prints  ASCII text to a printer connected to a terminal or terminal
       emulator.  It uses terminal escape sequences to print, and can substitute  for  <b><a href="../man1/lpr.1.html">lpr</a></b>(1)  in  circumstances
       where the printer is not connected directly to the host or available via TCP/IP.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-b</b>     Causes  <b>vtprint</b> to open the output stream in binary modes, overriding any automatic postprocessing
              done by the host (e.g. CR/LF translations).  This has no effect if the output stream is not a  tty
              device.

       <b>-B</b>     Undoes  the  effect of the <b>-b</b> option.  Note that this does <u>not</u> open the output stream in text mode
              if it would not normally be opened in that mode.

       <b>-c</b>     Causes <b>vtprint</b> to append any linefeeds (ASCII 0xA) with carriage returns  (ASCII  0xD).   This  is
              useful  for  printing  data from a UNIX or similar host to an MS-DOS system's printer that expects
              CR/LF line termination.

       <b>-C</b>     Causes <b>vtprint</b> to pass all carriage returns and linefeeds unmodified.

       <b>-d</b>     Use the tty device file instead of stdout for output.  This is defined as <b>/dev/tty</b> on this system.
              (This is operating system specific and may vary from system to system.) This is useful  for  using
              <b>vtprint</b>  as  a  pipe called by programs that suppress or redirect the stdout stream of the pipe or
              printing process.

       <b>-D</b>     Use the stdout stream for output, rather than a tty device file.

       <b>-e</b>     Forces <b>vtprint</b> to ignore the TERM environment variable and use the builtin control codes instead.

       <b>-E</b>     Undoes the effect of the <b>-e</b>  option,  which  allows  <b>vtprint</b>  to  attempt  to  find  an  entry  in
              <b>/etc/vtprintcap</b> for the TERM value and use the corresponding control codes.

       <b>-f</b>     Requests <b>vtprint</b> to suppress inclusion of formfeeds (ASCII 0xC) between multiple files.  Note that
              this has no affect on any formfeeds that may be present in the input files already.

       <b>-F</b>     Requests  <b>vtprint</b> to include formfeeds between multiple files specified on the command-line and at
              the end of the last file printed.

       <b>-h</b>     Print out a simple usage message.

       <b>-l</b>     Print out the <b>vtprint</b> license agreement.

       <b>-L</b> <u>vtprintcap</u>
              Specifies an alternate file to use instead of <b>/etc/vtprintcap</b>.

       <b>-n</b>     Causes <b>vtprint</b> to strip the CR from any CR/LF sequences.  This will not affect handling of any CRs
              present elsewhere in the file.

       <b>-N</b>     Causes <b>vtprint</b> to pass all carriage returns and linefeeds unmodified.

       <b>-q</b>     Quiet mode.  Suppress various status messages from being displayed,  useful  in  situations  where
              <b>vtprint</b> is used as part of a shell script, for example.

       <b>-Q</b>     Cancels the effect of the <b>-q</b> option, allowing normal progress reporting to occur.

       <b>-t</b>     Force  the  use  of  the TERM variable to perform a look up of the control sequences to be used in
              <b>/etc/vtprintcap</b>.  If an entry in that file can't be found, <b>vtprint</b> will abort with an error.

       <b>-T</b> <u>termtype</u>
              Use the value of <u>termtype</u> instead of the value of the TERM environment  variable  when  performing
              lookups in <b>/etc/vtprintcap</b>.

       <b>-v</b>     Display version information.

       <b>-V</b> <u>device</u>
              Specifies an alternate device file instead of <b>/dev/tty</b> to use.

       <b>-w</b>     Display important warranty waiver information.  NO WARRANTY!

       <b>--</b>     This  option  changes  no  special operational parameters of <b>vtprint.</b>  But it does indicate to the
              program that all of the command-line arguments which follow are to be parsed as filenames, even if
              they begin with a dash.  Hence to process a single file  with  the  name  "file"  you  would  call
              <b>vtprint</b> as " <b>vtprint</b>  --  -file".

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       TERM   the type of the terminal <b>vtprint</b> will assume is being used.

       VTPRINT
              string of options to be used by <b>vtprint.</b>

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vtprint</b>  was  written by Garrett D'Amore, on December 27, 1993 and last modified on October 25, 1994.  It
       is heavily derived from a similar program, called <b>lprint,</b> by the same author.   He  can  be  reached  via
       Internet e-mail at <a href="mailto:garrett@sciences.sdsu.edu">garrett@sciences.sdsu.edu</a>.

</pre><h4><b>DISTRIBUTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  latest  version  of  <b>vtprint</b>  can  be  obtained by anonymous ftp at ftp.sdsu.edu in the <b>/pub/vtprint</b>
       directory.  Please read the <b>INDEX</b> and <b>README</b> files before downloading.

       If you do not have ftp availability, then you can request a uuencoded copy of <b>vtprint</b> be sent to you  via
       e-mail  from the author.  The author is also willing to make other arrangements as needed, within certain
       limitations.

</pre><h4><b>COPYRIGHT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vtprint</b> is copyrighted 1994, by Garrett D'Amore.  It may be freely redistributed or modified, so long  as
       this  and  any other copyright notices are included in their original form with the program.  The user is
       granted the right to use this program without limitation.

</pre><h4><b>DISCLAIMER</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vtprint</b> is provided WITHOUT WARRANTY.  The user agrees to indemnify the author from any claims of  damage
       or loss arising from the use of or inability to use this program.  In other words, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vtprint</b>  cannot  be used to print files containing non-printable characters, as these may cause conflicts
       with the terminal or emulator used.

       When used over a serial (modem) connection, <b>vtprint</b> may not work properly unless hardware (CTS/RTS)  flow
       control is used.  This is due to the fact that most printers are slower than serial connections in common
       use.

       <b>vtprint</b>  uses terminal escape sequences to print, and not all terminal emulators support these sequences,
       and of those that do, some support it differently.  You can find a listing of some of the programs  known
       to  work  and  not  to work with <b>vtprint</b> in the file <b>COMPAT.</b>  The best thing to do is try your particular
       emulator, and find out if it works.  The author would appreciate any reports of success  or  failure,  or
       strange  behavior.   You  can  send those to him via Internet e-mail.  (See the <b>AUTHOR</b> chapter for how to
       reach him.)

       The <b>/etc/vtprintcap</b> file is still largely incomplete.  The  author  would  very  much  appreciate  it  if
       individuals  with  more information different terminals would get in contact with him so that support can
       be added for these terminals in the master archive.

       Do <u>not</u> background this program, as it has no way of knowing when it is in the background and when  it  is
       in  the  foreground.   This  will  result in your foreground process' output being printed as well as the
       output from <b>vtprint.</b>

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/etc/vtprintcap</b>

</pre><h4><b>TODOS</b></h4><pre>
       Fix any bugs present, clean-up the documentation, continue to  build  upon  entries  in  the  <b>COMPAT</b>  and
       <b>/etc/vtprintcap</b> files, and  finally, finish getting a college education!

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vtprint</b>  doesn't handle some signals properly, especially the SIGKILL and SIGSTOP signals, which can't be
       caught anyway.  Also it doesn't check to see  if  you  have  backgrounded  the  process.   The  resulting
       condition may leave all output directed to the printer instead of the screen.  The fix for this condition
       is to run the provided <b>vtprtoff</b> program with no arguments, which will restore normal screen output.  (You
       probably won't be able to see what you're typing while you start <b>vtprtoff</b> from the shell.)
