       tmate — terminal multiplexer with instant terminal sharing

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tmate</b>   [show-messages]  [<b>-2CluvV</b>]  [<b>-c</b>  <u>shell-command</u>]  [<b>-f</b>  <u>file</u>]  [<b>-L</b>  <u>socket-name</u>]  [<b>-S</b>  <u>socket-path</u>]
             [<u>command</u> [<u>flags</u>]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tmate</b> is a terminal multiplexer with instant terminal sharing: it enables a number  of  terminals  to  be
       created,  accessed,  and  controlled from a single screen and be shared with another mates.  <b>tmate</b> may be
       detached from a screen and continue running in the background, then later reattached, like as a daemon.

       <b>tmate</b> provides an instant pairing solution, allowing  you  to  share  a  terminal  with  one  or  several
       teammates.  Together with a voice call, it's almost like pairing in person. The terminal sharing works by
       using SSH connections to backend servers maintained by tmate upstream developers; teammates  need  to  be
       given a randomly-generated token to be able to join a session.

       <b>tmate</b>  is a modified version of tmux, and uses the same configurations such as keybindings, color schemes
       etc.

       When <b>tmate</b> is started it creates a new <u>session</u> with a single <u>window</u> and displays it on screen.  A  status
       line  at  the bottom of the screen shows information on the current session, such as ssh command to share
       with your mate, and is used to enter interactive commands.

       A session is a single collection of <u>pseudo</u> <u>terminals</u> under the management of <b>tmate</b>.  Each session has one
       or more windows linked to it.  A window occupies the entire screen and  may  be  split  into  rectangular
       panes,  each  of  which  is  a  separate  pseudo terminal (the <u><a href="../man4/pty.4.html">pty</a></u>(4) manual page documents the technical
       details of pseudo terminals).  Any number of <b>tmate</b> instances may connect to the  same  session,  and  any
       number of windows may be present in the same session.  Once all sessions are killed, <b>tmate</b> exits.

       Each  session is persistent and will survive accidental disconnection (such as <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) connection timeout)
       or intentional detaching (with the ‘C-b d’ key strokes).  <b>tmate</b> may be reattached using:

             <b>$</b> <b>tmate</b> <b>attach</b>

       In <b>tmate</b>, a session is displayed on screen by a <u>client</u> and all sessions are managed by a  single  <u>server</u>.
       The server and each client are separate processes which communicate through a socket in <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u>.

       The options are as follows:

       <b>-2</b>            Force <b>tmate</b> to assume the terminal supports 256 colours.

       <b>-C</b>            Start in control mode (see the “CONTROL MODE” section).  Given twice (<b>-CC</b>) disables echo.

       <b>-c</b> <u>shell-command</u>
                     Execute  <u>shell-command</u>  using  the  default  shell.  If necessary, the <b>tmate</b> server will be
                     started to retrieve the <b>default-shell</b> option.  This option is for compatibility with  <u><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></u>(1)
                     when <b>tmate</b> is used as a login shell.

       <b>-f</b> <u>file</u>       Specify   an   alternative   configuration  file.   By  default,  <b>tmate</b>  loads  the  system
                     configuration  file  from  <u>@SYSCONFDIR@/tmux.conf</u>,  if  present,  then  looks  for  a  user
                     configuration file at <u><a href="file:~/.tmux.conf">~/.tmux.conf</a></u> and <u><a href="file:~/.tmate.conf">~/.tmate.conf</a></u>.

                     The  configuration  file is a set of <b>tmate</b> commands which are executed in sequence when the
                     server is first started.  <b>tmate</b> loads configuration files once when the server process  has
                     started.  The <b>source-file</b> command may be used to load a file later.

                     <b>tmate</b>  shows  any  error messages from commands in configuration files in the first session
                     created, and continues to process the rest of the configuration file.

       <b>-L</b> <u>socket-name</u>
                     <b>tmate</b> stores the server socket in a directory under TMUX_TMPDIR or <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u>  if  it  is  unset.
                     The  default  socket  is  named  <u>default</u>.  This option allows a different socket name to be
                     specified, allowing several independent <b>tmate</b> servers to be run.  Unlike <b>-S</b> a full path  is
                     not necessary: the sockets are all created in the same directory.

                     If  the  socket is accidentally removed, the SIGUSR1 signal may be sent to the <b>tmate</b> server
                     process to recreate it (note that this will fail if any parent directories are missing).

       <b>-l</b>            Behave as a login shell.  This flag currently has no effect and is for  compatibility  with
                     other shells when using <b>tmate</b> as a login shell.

       <b>-S</b> <u>socket-path</u>
                     Specify  a  full  alternative  path  to the server socket.  If <b>-S</b> is specified, the default
                     socket directory is not used and any <b>-L</b> flag is ignored.

       <b>-u</b>            <b>tmate</b> attempts to guess if the terminal is likely to support UTF-8 by checking the first of
                     the LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE and LANG environment variables to be set for the string "UTF-8".  This
                     is not always correct: the <b>-u</b> flag explicitly informs <b>tmate</b> that UTF-8 is supported.

                     Note that <b>tmate</b> itself always accepts UTF-8; this  controls  whether  it  will  send  UTF-8
                     characters to the terminal it is running (if not, they are replaced by ‘_’).

       <b>-v</b>            Request  verbose  logging.   This  option  may  be  specified multiple times for increasing
                     verbosity.  Log messages will be saved  into  <u>tmux-client-PID.log</u>  and  <u>tmux-server-PID.log</u>
                     files in the current directory, where <u>PID</u> is the PID of the server or client process.

       <b>-V</b>            Report the <b>tmate</b> version.

       <u>command</u> [<u>flags</u>]
                     This  specifies  one  of  a  set  of  commands  used  to control <b>tmate</b>, as described in the
                     following sections.  If no commands are specified, the <b>new-session</b> command is assumed.

</pre><h4><b>KEY</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tmate</b> may be controlled from an attached client by using a key combination of a prefix key, ‘C-b’  (Ctrl-
       b) by default, followed by a command key.

       The default command key bindings are:

             C-b         Send the prefix key (C-b) through to the application.
             C-o         Rotate the panes in the current window forwards.
             C-z         Suspend the <b>tmate</b> client.
             !           Break the current pane out of the window.
             "           Split the current pane into two, top and bottom.
             #           List all paste buffers.
             $           Rename the current session.
             %           Split the current pane into two, left and right.
             &amp;           Kill the current window.
             '           Prompt for a window index to select.
             (           Switch the attached client to the previous session.
             )           Switch the attached client to the next session.
             ,           Rename the current window.
             -           Delete the most recently copied buffer of text.
             .           Prompt for an index to move the current window.
             0 to 9      Select windows 0 to 9.
             :           Enter the <b>tmate</b> command prompt.
             ;           Move to the previously active pane.
             =           Choose which buffer to paste interactively from a list.
             ?           List all key bindings.
             D           Choose a client to detach.
             L           Switch the attached client back to the last session.
             [           Enter copy mode to copy text or view the history.
             ]           Paste the most recently copied buffer of text.
             c           Create a new window.
             d           Detach the current client.
             f           Prompt to search for text in open windows.
             i           Display some information about the current window.
             l           Move to the previously selected window.
             n           Change to the next window.
             o           Select the next pane in the current window.
             p           Change to the previous window.
             q           Briefly display pane indexes.
             r           Force redraw of the attached client.
             m           Mark the current pane (see <b>select-pane</b> <b>-m</b>).
             M           Clear the marked pane.
             s           Select a new session for the attached client interactively.
             t           Show the time.
             w           Choose the current window interactively.
             x           Kill the current pane.
             z           Toggle zoom state of the current pane.
             {           Swap the current pane with the previous pane.
             }           Swap the current pane with the next pane.
             ~           Show previous messages from <b>tmate</b>, if any.
             Page Up     Enter copy mode and scroll one page up.
             Up, Down
             Left, Right
                         Change to the pane above, below, to the left, or to the right of the current pane.
             M-1 to M-5  Arrange  panes in one of the five preset layouts: even-horizontal, even-vertical, main-
                         horizontal, main-vertical, or tiled.
             Space       Arrange the current window in the next preset layout.
             M-n         Move to the next window with a bell or activity marker.
             M-o         Rotate the panes in the current window backwards.
             M-p         Move to the previous window with a bell or activity marker.
             C-Up, C-Down
             C-Left, C-Right
                         Resize the current pane in steps of one cell.
             M-Up, M-Down
             M-Left, M-Right
                         Resize the current pane in steps of five cells.

       Key bindings may be changed with the <b>bind-key</b> and <b>unbind-key</b> commands.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       This section contains a list of the commands supported by <b>tmate</b>.  Most commands accept  the  optional  <b>-t</b>
       (and  sometimes  <b>-s</b>)  argument  with  one of <u>target-client</u>, <u>target-session</u> <u>target-window</u>, or <u>target-pane</u>.
       These specify the client, session, window or pane which a command should affect.

       <u>target-client</u> is the name of the <u><a href="../man4/pty.4.html">pty</a></u>(4) file to which the client is  connected,  for  example  either  of
       <u>/dev/ttyp1</u>  or <u>ttyp1</u> for the client attached to <u>/dev/ttyp1</u>.  If no client is specified, <b>tmate</b> attempts to
       work out the client currently in use; if that fails, an error is reported.  Clients may  be  listed  with
       the <b>list-clients</b> command.

       <u>target-session</u> is tried as, in order:

             1.   A session ID prefixed with a $.

             2.   An exact name of a session (as listed by the <b>list-sessions</b> command).

             3.   The start of a session name, for example ‘mysess’ would match a session named ‘mysession’.

             4.   An <u><a href="../man3/fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch</a></u>(3) pattern which is matched against the session name.

       If  the  session  name  is  prefixed with an ‘=’, only an exact match is accepted (so ‘=mysess’ will only
       match exactly ‘mysess’, not ‘mysession’).

       If a single session is found, it is used as the target session; multiple matches produce an error.  If  a
       session  is  omitted,  the  current session is used if available; if no current session is available, the
       most recently used is chosen.

       <u>target-window</u> (or <u>src-window</u> or <u>dst-window</u>) specifies a  window  in  the  form  <u>session</u>:<u>window</u>.   <u>session</u>
       follows the same rules as for <u>target-session</u>, and <u>window</u> is looked for in order as:

             1.   A special token, listed below.

             2.   A window index, for example ‘mysession:1’ is window 1 in session ‘mysession’.

             3.   A window ID, such as @1.

             4.   An exact window name, such as ‘mysession:mywindow’.

             5.   The start of a window name, such as ‘mysession:mywin’.

             6.   As an <u><a href="../man3/fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch</a></u>(3) pattern matched against the window name.

       Like  sessions, a ‘=’ prefix will do an exact match only.  An empty window name specifies the next unused
       index if appropriate (for example the <b>new-window</b> and <b>link-window</b> commands) otherwise the  current  window
       in <u>session</u> is chosen.

       The  following  special tokens are available to indicate particular windows.  Each has a single-character
       alternative form.

       <b>Token</b>              <b>Meaning</b>
       <b>{start}</b>       ^    The lowest-numbered window
       <b>{end}</b>         $    The highest-numbered window
       <b>{last}</b>        !    The last (previously current) window
       <b>{next}</b>        +    The next window by number
       <b>{previous}</b>    -    The previous window by number

       <u>target-pane</u> (or <u>src-pane</u> or <u>dst-pane</u>) may be a pane ID or takes a similar form to <u>target-window</u> but  with
       the   optional   addition   of   a   period   followed   by  a  pane  index  or  pane  ID,  for  example:
       ‘mysession:mywindow.1’.  If the pane index is omitted, the currently active pane in the specified  window
       is used.  The following special tokens are available for the pane index:

       <b>Token</b>                  <b>Meaning</b>
       <b>{last}</b>            !    The last (previously active) pane
       <b>{next}</b>            +    The next pane by number
       <b>{previous}</b>        -    The previous pane by number
       <b>{top}</b>                  The top pane
       <b>{bottom}</b>               The bottom pane
       <b>{left}</b>                 The leftmost pane
       <b>{right}</b>                The rightmost pane
       <b>{top-left}</b>             The top-left pane
       <b>{top-right}</b>            The top-right pane
       <b>{bottom-left}</b>          The bottom-left pane
       <b>{bottom-right}</b>         The bottom-right pane
       <b>{up-of}</b>                The pane above the active pane
       <b>{down-of}</b>              The pane below the active pane
       <b>{left-of}</b>              The pane to the left of the active pane
       <b>{right-of}</b>             The pane to the right of the active pane

       The tokens ‘+’ and ‘-’ may be followed by an offset, for example:

             select-window -t:+2

       In  addition,  <u>target-session</u>,  <u>target-window</u>  or <u>target-pane</u> may consist entirely of the token ‘{mouse}’
       (alternative form ‘=’) to specify the most recent mouse  event  (see  the  “MOUSE  SUPPORT”  section)  or
       ‘{marked}’ (alternative form ‘~’) to specify the marked pane (see <b>select-pane</b> <b>-m</b>).

       Sessions,  window  and  panes  are  each  numbered with a unique ID; session IDs are prefixed with a ‘$’,
       windows with a ‘@’, and panes with a ‘%’.  These are unique  and  are  unchanged  for  the  life  of  the
       session,  window  or pane in the <b>tmate</b> server.  The pane ID is passed to the child process of the pane in
       the TMUX_PANE environment variable.  IDs  may  be  displayed  using  the  ‘session_id’,  ‘window_id’,  or
       ‘pane_id’  formats  (see  the  “FORMATS” section) and the <b>display-message</b>, <b>list-sessions</b>, <b>list-windows</b> or
       <b>list-panes</b> commands.

       <u>shell-command</u> arguments are <u><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></u>(1) commands.  This may be a single  argument  passed  to  the  shell,  for
       example:

             new-window 'vi <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>'

       Will run:

             <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a> -c 'vi <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>'

       Additionally,  the  <b>new-window</b>, <b>new-session</b>, <b>split-window</b>, <b>respawn-window</b> and <b>respawn-pane</b> commands allow
       <u>shell-command</u> to be given as multiple arguments and executed directly (without ‘sh -c’).  This can  avoid
       issues with shell quoting.  For example:

             $ tmate new-window vi <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>

       Will run <u><a href="../man1/vi.1.html">vi</a></u>(1) directly without invoking the shell.

       <u>command</u>  [<u>arguments</u>]  refers  to  a  <b>tmate</b> command, passed with the command and arguments separately, for
       example:

             bind-key F1 set-window-option force-width 81

       Or if using <u><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></u>(1):

             $ tmate bind-key F1 set-window-option force-width 81

       Multiple commands may be specified together as part of  a  <u>command</u>  <u>sequence</u>.   Each  command  should  be
       separated  by  spaces  and  a  semicolon; commands are executed sequentially from left to right and lines
       ending with a backslash continue on to the next line,  except  when  escaped  by  another  backslash.   A
       literal semicolon may be included by escaping it with a backslash (for example, when specifying a command
       sequence to <b>bind-key</b>).

       Example <b>tmate</b> commands include:

             refresh-client -t/dev/ttyp2

             rename-session -tfirst newname

             set-window-option -t:0 monitor-activity on

             new-window ; split-window -d

             bind-key R source-file <a href="file:~/.tmux.conf">~/.tmux.conf</a> \; \
                     display-message "source-file done"

       Or from <u><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></u>(1):

</pre><h4><b>CLIENTS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SESSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>tmate</b>  server  manages  clients,  sessions,  windows and panes.  Clients are attached to sessions to
       interact with them, either when they are  created  with  the  <b>new-session</b>  command,  or  later  with  the
       <b>attach-session</b>  command.   Each session has one or more windows <u>linked</u> into it.  Windows may be linked to
       multiple sessions and are made up of one or more  panes,  each  of  which  contains  a  pseudo  terminal.
       Commands  for creating, linking and otherwise manipulating windows are covered in the “WINDOWS AND PANES”
       section.

       The following commands are available to manage clients and sessions:

       <b>attach-session</b> [<b>-dEr</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>working-directory</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-session</u>]
                     (alias: <b>attach</b>)
               If run from outside <b>tmate</b>, create a  new  client  in  the  current  terminal  and  attach  it  to
               <u>target-session</u>.   If  used from inside, switch the current client.  If <b>-d</b> is specified, any other
               clients attached to the session are detached.  <b>-r</b> signifies the client is  read-only  (only  keys
               bound to the <b>detach-client</b> or <b>switch-client</b> commands have any effect)

               If  no server is started, <b>attach-session</b> will attempt to start it; this will fail unless sessions
               are created in the configuration file.

               The <u>target-session</u> rules for <b>attach-session</b> are slightly adjusted: if <b>tmate</b> needs to  select  the
               most recently used session, it will prefer the most recently used <u>unattached</u> session.

               <b>-c</b> will set the session working directory (used for new windows) to <u>working-directory</u>.

               If <b>-E</b> is used, the <b>update-environment</b> option will not be applied.

       <b>detach-client</b> [<b>-aP</b>] [<b>-s</b> <u>target-session</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-client</u>]
                     (alias: <b>detach</b>)
               Detach  the  current  client  if  bound  to  a  key, the client specified with <b>-t</b>, or all clients
               currently attached to the session specified by <b>-s</b>.  The <b>-a</b> option kills all but the client  given
               with  <b>-t</b>.   If <b>-P</b> is given, send SIGHUP to the parent process of the client, typically causing it
               to exit.

       <b>has-session</b> [<b>-t</b> <u>target-session</u>]
                     (alias: <b>has</b>)
               Report an error and exit with 1 if the specified session does not exist.  If it does exist,  exit
               with 0.

       <b>kill-server</b>
               Kill the <b>tmate</b> server and clients and destroy all sessions.

       <b>kill-session</b> [<b>-aC</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-session</u>]
               Destroy  the given session, closing any windows linked to it and no other sessions, and detaching
               all clients attached to it.  If <b>-a</b> is given, all sessions but the specified one is  killed.   The
               <b>-C</b> flag clears alerts (bell, activity, or silence) in all windows linked to the session.

       <b>list-clients</b> [<b>-F</b> <u>format</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-session</u>]
                     (alias: <b>lsc</b>)
               List  all  clients  attached  to  the  server.  For the meaning of the <b>-F</b> flag, see the “FORMATS”
               section.  If <u>target-session</u> is specified, list only clients connected to that session.

       <b>list-commands</b>
                     (alias: <b>lscm</b>)
               List the syntax of all commands supported by <b>tmate</b>.

       <b>list-sessions</b> [<b>-F</b> <u>format</u>]
                     (alias: <b>ls</b>)
               List all sessions managed by the server.  For the meaning of  the  <b>-F</b>  flag,  see  the  “FORMATS”
               section.

       <b>lock-client</b> [<b>-t</b> <u>target-client</u>]
                     (alias: <b>lockc</b>)
               Lock <u>target-client</u>, see the <b>lock-server</b> command.

       <b>lock-session</b> [<b>-t</b> <u>target-session</u>]
                     (alias: <b>locks</b>)
               Lock all clients attached to <u>target-session</u>.

       <b>new-session</b>   [<b>-AdDEP</b>]   [<b>-c</b>   <u>start-directory</u>]  [<b>-F</b>  <u>format</u>]  [<b>-n</b>  <u>window-name</u>]  [<b>-s</b>  <u>session-name</u>]  [<b>-t</b>
               <u>target-session</u>] [<b>-x</b> <u>width</u>] [<b>-y</b> <u>height</u>] [<u>shell-command</u>]
                     (alias: <b>new</b>)
               Create a new session with name <u>session-name</u>.

               The new session is attached to  the  current  terminal  unless  <b>-d</b>  is  given.   <u>window-name</u>  and
               <u>shell-command</u> are the name of and shell command to execute in the initial window.  If <b>-d</b> is used,
               <b>-x</b> and <b>-y</b> specify the size of the initial window (80 by 24 if not given).

               If  run  from a terminal, any <u><a href="../man4/termios.4.html">termios</a></u>(4) special characters are saved and used for new windows in
               the new session.

               The <b>-A</b> flag makes <b>new-session</b> behave like <b>attach-session</b> if <u>session-name</u> already exists; in  this
               case, <b>-D</b> behaves like <b>-d</b> to <b>attach-session</b>.

               If  <b>-t</b>  is given, the new session is <u>grouped</u> with <u>target-session</u>.  This means they share the same
               set of windows - all windows from <u>target-session</u> are linked to the new session, any  new  windows
               are  linked  to both sessions and any windows closed removed from both sessions.  The current and
               previous window and any session options remain independent  and  either  session  may  be  killed
               without affecting the other.  <b>-n</b> and <u>shell-command</u> are invalid if <b>-t</b> is used.

               The <b>-P</b> option prints information about the new session after it has been created.  By default, it
               uses the format ‘#{session_name}:’ but a different format may be specified with <b>-F</b>.

               If <b>-E</b> is used, the <b>update-environment</b> option will not be applied.

       <b>refresh-client</b> [<b>-S</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-client</u>]
                     (alias: <b>refresh</b>)
               Refresh  the current client if bound to a key, or a single client if one is given with <b>-t</b>.  If <b>-S</b>
               is specified, only update the client's status bar.

       <b>rename-session</b> [<b>-t</b> <u>target-session</u>] <u>new-name</u>
                     (alias: <b>rename</b>)
               Rename the session to <u>new-name</u>.

       <b>show-messages</b> [<b>-JT</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-client</u>]
                     (alias: <b>showmsgs</b>)
               Show client messages or server information.  Any messages displayed on the status line are  saved
               in a per-client message log, up to a maximum of the limit set by the <u>message-limit</u> server option.
               With  <b>-t</b>, display the log for <u>target-client</u>.  <b>-J</b> and <b>-T</b> show debugging information about jobs and
               terminals.

       <b>source-file</b> <u>path</u>
                     (alias: <b>source</b>)
               Execute commands from <u>path</u>.

       <b>start-server</b>
                     (alias: <b>start</b>)
               Start the <b>tmate</b> server, if not already running, without creating any sessions.

       <b>suspend-client</b> [<b>-t</b> <u>target-client</u>]
                     (alias: <b>suspendc</b>)
               Suspend a client by sending SIGTSTP (tty stop).

       <b>switch-client</b> [<b>-Elnpr</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>target-client</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-session</u>] [<b>-T</b> <u>key-table</u>]
                     (alias: <b>switchc</b>)
               Switch the current session for client <u>target-client</u> to <u>target-session</u>.  If <b>-l</b>, <b>-n</b> or <b>-p</b> is  used,
               the  client  is  moved  to the last, next or previous session respectively.  <b>-r</b> toggles whether a
               client is read-only (see the <b>attach-session</b> command).

               If <b>-E</b> is used, <b>update-environment</b> option will not be applied.

               <b>-T</b> sets the client's key table; the next key from the client will be interpreted from  <u>key-table</u>.
               This  may  be  used  to configure multiple prefix keys, or to bind commands to sequences of keys.
               For example, to make typing ‘abc’ run the <b>list-keys</b> command:

                     bind-key -Ttable2 c list-keys
                     bind-key -Ttable1 b switch-client -Ttable2
                     bind-key -Troot   a switch-client -Ttable1

</pre><h4><b>WINDOWS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>PANES</b></h4><pre>
       A <b>tmate</b> window may be in one of several modes.   The  default  permits  direct  access  to  the  terminal
       attached to the window.  The other is copy mode, which permits a section of a window or its history to be
       copied  to  a  <u>paste</u>  <u>buffer</u>  for  later  insertion  into  another window.  This mode is entered with the
       <b>copy-mode</b> command, bound to ‘[’ by default.  It is also entered when a command that produces output, such
       as <b>list-keys</b>, is executed from a key binding.

       The keys available depend on whether emacs or vi mode  is  selected  (see  the  <b>mode-keys</b>  option).   The
       following keys are supported as appropriate for the mode:

             <b>Function</b>                     <b>vi</b>              <b>emacs</b>
             <b>Append</b> <b>selection</b>             A

             <b>Transpose</b> <b>characters</b>                         C-t

       The  next  and  previous  word  keys  use space and the ‘-’, ‘_’ and ‘@’ characters as word delimiters by
       default, but this can be adjusted by setting the <u>word-separators</u> session option.  Next word moves to  the
       start  of  the next word, next word end to the end of the next word and previous word to the start of the
       previous word.  The three next and previous space keys work similarly but use a space alone as  the  word
       separator.

       The  jump  commands  enable  quick movement within a line.  For instance, typing ‘f’ followed by ‘/’ will
       move the cursor to the next ‘/’ character on the current  line.   A  ‘;’  will  then  jump  to  the  next
       occurrence.

       Commands  in  copy  mode  may be prefaced by an optional repeat count.  With vi key bindings, a prefix is
       entered using the number keys; with emacs, the Alt (meta) key and a  number  begins  prefix  entry.   For
       example, to move the cursor forward by ten words, use ‘M-1 0 M-f’ in emacs mode, and ‘10w’ in vi.

       Mode  key  bindings  are defined in a set of named tables: <u>vi-edit</u> and <u>emacs-edit</u> for keys used when line
       editing at the command prompt; <u>vi-choice</u> and <u>emacs-choice</u> for keys used when choosing from lists (such as
       produced by the <b>choose-window</b> command); and <u>vi-copy</u> and <u>emacs-copy</u> used in copy mode.  The tables may  be
       viewed  with  the  <b>list-keys</b>  command  and  keys  modified  or  removed with <b>bind-key</b> and <b>unbind-key</b>.  If
       <b>append-selection</b>, <b>copy-selection</b>, or <b>start-named-buffer</b> are given the <b>-x</b> flag, <b>tmate</b> will not  exit  copy
       mode after copying.  <b>copy-pipe</b> copies the selection and pipes it to a command.  For example the following
       will  bind ‘C-w’ not to exit after copying and ‘C-q’ to copy the selection into <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u> as well as the paste
       buffer:

             bind-key -temacs-copy C-w copy-selection -x
             bind-key -temacs-copy C-q copy-pipe "cat &gt;/tmp/out"

       The paste buffer key pastes the first line from the top paste buffer on the stack.

       The synopsis for the <b>copy-mode</b> command is:

       <b>copy-mode</b> [<b>-Meu</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>]
               Enter copy mode.  The <b>-u</b> option scrolls one page up.  <b>-M</b> begins a mouse drag (only valid if bound
               to a mouse key binding, see “MOUSE SUPPORT”).  <b>-e</b> specifies that scrolling to the bottom  of  the
               history  (to the visible screen) should exit copy mode.  While in copy mode, pressing a key other
               than those used for scrolling will disable this  behaviour.   This  is  intended  to  allow  fast
               scrolling through a pane's history, for example with:

                     bind PageUp copy-mode -eu

       Each  window displayed by <b>tmate</b> may be split into one or more <u>panes</u>; each pane takes up a certain area of
       the display and is a separate terminal.  A window may be split into panes using the <b>split-window</b> command.
       Windows may be split horizontally (with the <b>-h</b> flag) or  vertically.   Panes  may  be  resized  with  the
       <b>resize-pane</b>  command  (bound to ‘C-up’, ‘C-down’ ‘C-left’ and ‘C-right’ by default), the current pane may
       be changed with the <b>select-pane</b> command and the <b>rotate-window</b> and <b>swap-pane</b> commands may be used to  swap
       panes  without  changing  their  position.   Panes are numbered beginning from zero in the order they are
       created.

       A number of preset <u>layouts</u> are available.  These may be selected with the <b>select-layout</b> command or cycled
       with <b>next-layout</b> (bound to ‘Space’ by default); once a layout is chosen, panes within it may be moved and
       resized as normal.

       The following layouts are supported:

       <b>even-horizontal</b>
               Panes are spread out evenly from left to right across the window.

       <b>even-vertical</b>
               Panes are spread evenly from top to bottom.

       <b>main-horizontal</b>
               A large (main) pane is shown at the top of the window and the remaining  panes  are  spread  from
               left  to  right  in  the leftover space at the bottom.  Use the <u>main-pane-height</u> window option to
               specify the height of the top pane.

       <b>main-vertical</b>
               Similar to <b>main-horizontal</b> but the large pane is placed on the left and the  others  spread  from
               top to bottom along the right.  See the <u>main-pane-width</u> window option.

       <b>tiled</b>   Panes are spread out as evenly as possible over the window in both rows and columns.

       In  addition,  <b>select-layout</b>  may  be  used  to apply a previously used layout - the <b>list-windows</b> command
       displays the layout of each window in a form suitable for use with <b>select-layout</b>.  For example:

             $ tmate list-windows
             0: ksh [159x48]
                 layout: bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}
             $ tmate select-layout bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}

       <b>tmate</b> automatically adjusts the size of the layout for the current  window  size.   Note  that  a  layout
       cannot be applied to a window with more panes than that from which the layout was originally defined.

       Commands related to windows and panes are as follows:

       <b>break-pane</b> [<b>-dP</b>] [<b>-F</b> <u>format</u>] [<b>-s</b> <u>src-pane</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>dst-window</u>]
                     (alias: <b>breakp</b>)
               Break  <u>src-pane</u>  off from its containing window to make it the only pane in <u>dst-window</u>.  If <b>-d</b> is
               given, the new window does not become the current window.  The <b>-P</b> option prints information about
               the  new  window   after   it   has   been   created.    By   default,   it   uses   the   format
               ‘#{session_name}:#{window_index}’ but a different format may be specified with <b>-F</b>.

       <b>capture-pane</b> [<b>-aepPq</b>] [<b>-b</b> <u>buffer-name</u>] [<b>-E</b> <u>end-line</u>] [<b>-S</b> <u>start-line</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>]
                     (alias: <b>capturep</b>)
               Capture  the  contents  of  a  pane.  If <b>-p</b> is given, the output goes to stdout, otherwise to the
               buffer specified with <b>-b</b> or a new buffer if omitted.  If <b>-a</b> is given,  the  alternate  screen  is
               used,  and  the  history  is  not  accessible.   If  no alternate screen exists, an error will be
               returned unless <b>-q</b> is given.  If <b>-e</b> is given, the output includes escape sequences for  text  and
               background attributes.  <b>-C</b> also escapes non-printable characters as octal \xxx.  <b>-J</b> joins wrapped
               lines  and  preserves  trailing  spaces at each line's end.  <b>-P</b> captures only any output that the
               pane has received that is the beginning of an as-yet incomplete escape sequence.

               <b>-S</b> and <b>-E</b> specify the starting and ending line numbers, zero is the first  line  of  the  visible
               pane and negative numbers are lines in the history.  ‘-’ to <b>-S</b> is the start of the history and to
               <b>-E</b> the end of the visible pane.  The default is to capture only the visible contents of the pane.

       <b>choose-client</b> [<b>-F</b> <u>format</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-window</u>] [<u>template</u>]
               Put a window into client choice mode, allowing a client to be selected interactively from a list.
               After  a  client is chosen, ‘%%’ is replaced by the client <u><a href="../man4/pty.4.html">pty</a></u>(4) path in <u>template</u> and the result
               executed as a command.  If <u>template</u> is not given, "detach-client  -t  '%%'"  is  used.   For  the
               meaning  of  the  <b>-F</b>  flag,  see  the “FORMATS” section.  This command works only if at least one
               client is attached.

       <b>choose-session</b> [<b>-F</b> <u>format</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-window</u>] [<u>template</u>]
               Put a window into session choice mode, where a session may be selected interactively from a list.
               When one is chosen, ‘%%’ is replaced by the session name in <u>template</u> and the result executed as a
               command.  If <u>template</u> is not given, "switch-client -t '%%'" is used.  For the meaning of  the  <b>-F</b>
               flag, see the “FORMATS” section.  This command works only if at least one client is attached.

       <b>choose-tree</b> [<b>-suw</b>] [<b>-b</b> <u>session-template</u>] [<b>-c</b> <u>window-template</u>] [<b>-S</b> <u>format</u>] [<b>-W</b> <u>format</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-window</u>]
               Put  a  window  into  tree  choice  mode,  where  either  sessions  or  windows  may  be selected
               interactively from a list.  By default, windows belonging to a session are indented to show their
               relationship to a session.

               Note that the <b>choose-window</b> and <b>choose-session</b> commands are wrappers around <b>choose-tree</b>.

               If <b>-s</b> is given, will show sessions.  If <b>-w</b> is given, will show windows.

               By default, the tree is collapsed and sessions must be expanded to windows with the  right  arrow
               key.  The <b>-u</b> option will start with all sessions expanded instead.

               If  <b>-b</b>  is given, will override the default session command.  Note that ‘%%’ can be used and will
               be replaced with the session name.  The default option if  not  specified  is  "switch-client  -t
               '%%'".   If <b>-c</b> is given, will override the default window command.  Like <b>-b</b>, ‘%%’ can be used and
               will be replaced with the session name and window index.  When a window is chosen from the  list,
               the session command is run before the window command.

               If <b>-S</b> is given will display the specified format instead of the default session format.  If <b>-W</b> is
               given will display the specified format instead of the default window format.  For the meaning of
               the <b>-s</b> and <b>-w</b> options, see the “FORMATS” section.

               This command works only if at least one client is attached.

       <b>choose-window</b> [<b>-F</b> <u>format</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-window</u>] [<u>template</u>]
               Put  a  window  into  window choice mode, where a window may be chosen interactively from a list.
               After a window is selected, ‘%%’ is replaced by the session name and window index in <u>template</u> and
               the result executed as a command.  If <u>template</u> is not given, "select-window  -t  '%%'"  is  used.
               For  the  meaning of the <b>-F</b> flag, see the “FORMATS” section.  This command works only if at least
               one client is attached.

       <b>display-panes</b> [<b>-t</b> <u>target-client</u>]
                     (alias: <b>displayp</b>)
               Display a visible indicator of each pane shown by  <u>target-client</u>.   See  the  <b>display-panes-time</b>,
               <b>display-panes-colour</b>, and <b>display-panes-active-colour</b> session options.  While the indicator is on
               screen, a pane may be selected with the ‘0’ to ‘9’ keys.

       <b>find-window</b> [<b>-CNT</b>] [<b>-F</b> <u>format</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-window</u>] <u>match-string</u>
                     (alias: <b>findw</b>)
               Search  for the <u><a href="../man3/fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch</a></u>(3) pattern <u>match-string</u> in window names, titles, and visible content (but
               not history).  The flags control matching behavior: <b>-C</b> matches only visible window  contents,  <b>-N</b>
               matches only the window name and <b>-T</b> matches only the window title.  The default is <b>-CNT</b>.  If only
               one  window  is  matched, it'll be automatically selected, otherwise a choice list is shown.  For
               the meaning of the <b>-F</b> flag, see the “FORMATS” section.  This command works only if at  least  one
               client is attached.

       <b>join-pane</b> [<b>-bdhv</b>] [<b>-l</b> <u>size</u> | <b>-p</b> <u>percentage</u>] [<b>-s</b> <u>src-pane</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>dst-pane</u>]
                     (alias: <b>joinp</b>)
               Like  <b>split-window</b>,  but instead of splitting <u>dst-pane</u> and creating a new pane, split it and move
               <u>src-pane</u> into the space.  This can be used to reverse <b>break-pane</b>.  The <b>-b</b> option causes  <u>src-pane</u>
               to be joined to left of or above <u>dst-pane</u>.

               If  <b>-s</b>  is  omitted  and  a  marked pane is present (see <b>select-pane</b> <b>-m</b>), the marked pane is used
               rather than the current pane.

       <b>kill-pane</b> [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>]
                     (alias: <b>killp</b>)
               Destroy the given pane.  If no panes remain in the containing window, it is also destroyed.   The
               <b>-a</b> option kills all but the pane given with <b>-t</b>.

       <b>kill-window</b> [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-window</u>]
                     (alias: <b>killw</b>)
               Kill the current window or the window at <u>target-window</u>, removing it from any sessions to which it
               is linked.  The <b>-a</b> option kills all but the window given with <b>-t</b>.

       <b>last-pane</b> [<b>-de</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-window</u>]
                     (alias: <b>lastp</b>)
               Select the last (previously selected) pane.  <b>-e</b> enables or <b>-d</b> disables input to the pane.

       <b>last-window</b> [<b>-t</b> <u>target-session</u>]
                     (alias: <b>last</b>)
               Select the last (previously selected) window.  If no <u>target-session</u> is specified, select the last
               window of the current session.

       <b>link-window</b> [<b>-adk</b>] [<b>-s</b> <u>src-window</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>dst-window</u>]
                     (alias: <b>linkw</b>)
               Link  the  window  at  <u>src-window</u> to the specified <u>dst-window</u>.  If <u>dst-window</u> is specified and no
               such window exists, the <u>src-window</u> is linked there.  With <b>-a</b>, the window is  moved  to  the  next
               index up (following windows are moved if necessary).  If <b>-k</b> is given and <u>dst-window</u> exists, it is
               killed,  otherwise  an  error  is  generated.   If  <b>-d</b>  is  given, the newly linked window is not
               selected.

       <b>list-panes</b> [<b>-as</b>] [<b>-F</b> <u>format</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target</u>]
                     (alias: <b>lsp</b>)
               If <b>-a</b> is given, <u>target</u> is ignored and all panes on the server are listed.  If <b>-s</b> is given, <u>target</u>
               is a session (or the current session).  If neither is given, <u>target</u> is a window (or  the  current
               window).  For the meaning of the <b>-F</b> flag, see the “FORMATS” section.

       <b>list-windows</b> [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-F</b> <u>format</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-session</u>]
                     (alias: <b>lsw</b>)
               If  <b>-a</b>  is given, list all windows on the server.  Otherwise, list windows in the current session
               or in <u>target-session</u>.  For the meaning of the <b>-F</b> flag, see the “FORMATS” section.

       <b>move-pane</b> [<b>-bdhv</b>] [<b>-l</b> <u>size</u> | <b>-p</b> <u>percentage</u>] [<b>-s</b> <u>src-pane</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>dst-pane</u>]
                     (alias: <b>movep</b>)
               Like <b>join-pane</b>, but <u>src-pane</u> and <u>dst-pane</u> may belong to the same window.

       <b>move-window</b> [<b>-ardk</b>] [<b>-s</b> <u>src-window</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>dst-window</u>]
                     (alias: <b>movew</b>)
               This is similar to <b>link-window</b>, except the window at <u>src-window</u> is moved to <u>dst-window</u>.  With <b>-r</b>,
               all windows in the session are renumbered in sequential order, respecting the <b>base-index</b> option.

       <b>new-window</b> [<b>-adkP</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>start-directory</u>] [<b>-F</b> <u>format</u>] [<b>-n</b> <u>window-name</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-window</u>] [<u>shell-command</u>]
                     (alias: <b>neww</b>)
               Create a new window.  With <b>-a</b>, the new window is inserted at the next index up from the specified
               <u>target-window</u>, moving windows  up  if  necessary,  otherwise  <u>target-window</u>  is  the  new  window
               location.

               If  <b>-d</b>  is  given,  the  session  does not make the new window the current window.  <u>target-window</u>
               represents the window to be created; if the target already exists an error is shown,  unless  the
               <b>-k</b>  flag  is  used,  in which case it is destroyed.  <u>shell-command</u> is the command to execute.  If
               <u>shell-command</u> is not specified, the value of the <b>default-command</b> option is  used.   <b>-c</b>  specifies
               the working directory in which the new window is created.

               When  the  shell  command  completes, the window closes.  See the <b>remain-on-exit</b> option to change
               this behaviour.

               The TERM environment variable must be set to “screen” for all programs running <u>inside</u> <b>tmate</b>.  New
               windows will automatically have “TERM=screen” added to their environment, but care must be  taken
               not to reset this in shell start-up files.

               The  <b>-P</b> option prints information about the new window after it has been created.  By default, it
               uses the format ‘#{session_name}:#{window_index}’ but a different format may  be  specified  with
               <b>-F</b>.

       <b>next-layout</b> [<b>-t</b> <u>target-window</u>]
                     (alias: <b>nextl</b>)
               Move a window to the next layout and rearrange the panes to fit.

       <b>next-window</b> [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-session</u>]
                     (alias: <b>next</b>)
               Move to the next window in the session.  If <b>-a</b> is used, move to the next window with an alert.

       <b>pipe-pane</b> [<b>-o</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>] [<u>shell-command</u>]
                     (alias: <b>pipep</b>)
               Pipe  any output sent by the program in <u>target-pane</u> to a shell command.  A pane may only be piped
               to one command at a time, any existing pipe is closed  before  <u>shell-command</u>  is  executed.   The
               <u>shell-command</u>  string  may  contain  the special character sequences supported by the <b>status-left</b>
               option.  If no <u>shell-command</u> is given, the current pipe (if any) is closed.

               The <b>-o</b> option only opens a new pipe if no previous pipe exists, allowing a  pipe  to  be  toggled
               with a single key, for example:

                     bind-key C-p pipe-pane -o 'cat &gt;&gt;<a href="file:~/output.">~/output.</a>#I-#P'

       <b>previous-layout</b> [<b>-t</b> <u>target-window</u>]
                     (alias: <b>prevl</b>)
               Move to the previous layout in the session.

       <b>previous-window</b> [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-session</u>]
                     (alias: <b>prev</b>)
               Move to the previous window in the session.  With <b>-a</b>, move to the previous window with an alert.

       <b>rename-window</b> [<b>-t</b> <u>target-window</u>] <u>new-name</u>
                     (alias: <b>renamew</b>)
               Rename the current window, or the window at <u>target-window</u> if specified, to <u>new-name</u>.

       <b>resize-pane</b> [<b>-DLMRUZ</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>] [<b>-x</b> <u>width</u>] [<b>-y</b> <u>height</u>] [<u>adjustment</u>]
                     (alias: <b>resizep</b>)
               Resize  a  pane,  up,  down, left or right by <u>adjustment</u> with <b>-U</b>, <b>-D</b>, <b>-L</b> or <b>-R</b>, or to an absolute
               size with <b>-x</b> or <b>-y</b>.  The <u>adjustment</u> is given in lines or cells (the default is 1).

               With <b>-Z</b>, the active pane is toggled between zoomed  (occupying  the  whole  of  the  window)  and
               unzoomed (its normal position in the layout).

               <b>-M</b> begins mouse resizing (only valid if bound to a mouse key binding, see “MOUSE SUPPORT”).

       <b>respawn-pane</b> [<b>-k</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>] [<u>shell-command</u>]
                     (alias: <b>respawnp</b>)
               Reactivate  a  pane  in  which the command has exited (see the <b>remain-on-exit</b> window option).  If
               <u>shell-command</u> is not given, the command used when the pane was created  is  executed.   The  pane
               must be already inactive, unless <b>-k</b> is given, in which case any existing command is killed.

       <b>respawn-window</b> [<b>-k</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-window</u>] [<u>shell-command</u>]
                     (alias: <b>respawnw</b>)
               Reactivate  a  window in which the command has exited (see the <b>remain-on-exit</b> window option).  If
               <u>shell-command</u> is not given, the command used when the window was created is executed.  The window
               must be already inactive, unless <b>-k</b> is given, in which case any existing command is killed.

       <b>rotate-window</b> [<b>-DU</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-window</u>]
                     (alias: <b>rotatew</b>)
               Rotate the positions of the panes within a window, either upward (numerically lower) with  <b>-U</b>  or
               downward (numerically higher).

       <b>select-layout</b> [<b>-nop</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-window</u>] [<u>layout-name</u>]
                     (alias: <b>selectl</b>)
               Choose  a specific layout for a window.  If <u>layout-name</u> is not given, the last preset layout used
               (if any) is reapplied.  <b>-n</b> and <b>-p</b> are equivalent to the <b>next-layout</b> and <b>previous-layout</b> commands.
               <b>-o</b> applies the last set layout if possible (undoes the most recent layout change).

       <b>select-pane</b> [<b>-DdegLlMmRU</b>] [<b>-P</b> <u>style</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>]
                     (alias: <b>selectp</b>)
               Make pane <u>target-pane</u> the active pane in window <u>target-window</u>, or set its style  (with  <b>-P</b>).   If
               one  of  <b>-D</b>,  <b>-L</b>,  <b>-R</b>,  or <b>-U</b> is used, respectively the pane below, to the left, to the right, or
               above the target pane is used.  <b>-l</b> is the same as using the <b>last-pane</b> command.  <b>-e</b> enables or  <b>-d</b>
               disables input to the pane.

               <b>-m</b> and <b>-M</b> are used to set and clear the <u>marked</u> <u>pane</u>.  There is one marked pane at a time, setting
               a  new  marked  pane clears the last.  The marked pane is the default target for <b>-s</b> to <b>join-pane</b>,
               <b>swap-pane</b> and <b>swap-window</b>.

               Each pane has a style: by default the <b>window-style</b>  and  <b>window-active-style</b>  options  are  used,
               <b>select-pane</b>  <b>-P</b>  sets  the style for a single pane.  For example, to set the pane 1 background to
               red:

                     select-pane -t:.1 -P 'bg=red'

               <b>-g</b> shows the current pane style.

       <b>select-window</b> [<b>-lnpT</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-window</u>]
                     (alias: <b>selectw</b>)
               Select the window at <u>target-window</u>.  <b>-l</b>, <b>-n</b> and <b>-p</b> are equivalent to the <b>last-window</b>, <b>next-window</b>
               and <b>previous-window</b> commands.  If <b>-T</b> is given and the selected  window  is  already  the  current
               window, the command behaves like <b>last-window</b>.

       <b>split-window</b> [<b>-bdhvP</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>start-directory</u>] [<b>-l</b> <u>size</u> | <b>-p</b> <u>percentage</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>] [<u>shell-command</u>] [<b>-F</b>
               <u>format</u>]
                     (alias: <b>splitw</b>)
               Create  a  new pane by splitting <u>target-pane</u>: <b>-h</b> does a horizontal split and <b>-v</b> a vertical split;
               if neither is specified, <b>-v</b> is assumed.  The <b>-l</b> and <b>-p</b> options specify the size of the  new  pane
               in  lines  (for  vertical  split)  or  in  cells  (for  horizontal  split),  or  as a percentage,
               respectively.  The <b>-b</b> option causes the  new  pane  to  be  created  to  the  left  of  or  above
               <u>target-pane</u>.  All other options have the same meaning as for the <b>new-window</b> command.

       <b>swap-pane</b> [<b>-dDU</b>] [<b>-s</b> <u>src-pane</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>dst-pane</u>]
                     (alias: <b>swapp</b>)
               Swap  two panes.  If <b>-U</b> is used and no source pane is specified with <b>-s</b>, <u>dst-pane</u> is swapped with
               the previous pane (before it numerically); <b>-D</b> swaps with the next pane  (after  it  numerically).
               <b>-d</b> instructs <b>tmate</b> not to change the active pane.

               If  <b>-s</b>  is  omitted  and  a  marked pane is present (see <b>select-pane</b> <b>-m</b>), the marked pane is used
               rather than the current pane.

       <b>swap-window</b> [<b>-d</b>] [<b>-s</b> <u>src-window</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>dst-window</u>]
                     (alias: <b>swapw</b>)
               This is similar to <b>link-window</b>, except the source and destination windows are swapped.  It is  an
               error if no window exists at <u>src-window</u>.

               Like  <b>swap-pane</b>,  if  <b>-s</b> is omitted and a marked pane is present (see <b>select-pane</b> <b>-m</b>), the window
               containing the marked pane is used rather than the current window.

       <b>unlink-window</b> [<b>-k</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-window</u>]
                     (alias: <b>unlinkw</b>)
               Unlink <u>target-window</u>.  Unless <b>-k</b> is given, a window may be unlinked  only  if  it  is  linked  to
               multiple  sessions  - windows may not be linked to no sessions; if <b>-k</b> is specified and the window
               is linked to only one session, it is unlinked and destroyed.

</pre><h4><b>KEY</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tmate</b> allows a command to be bound to most keys, with or without a prefix  key.   When  specifying  keys,
       most  represent themselves (for example ‘A’ to ‘Z’).  Ctrl keys may be prefixed with ‘C-’ or ‘^’, and Alt
       (meta) with ‘M-’.  In addition, the following special key names are  accepted:  <u>Up</u>,  <u>Down</u>,  <u>Left</u>,  <u>Right</u>,
       <u>BSpace</u>,  <u>BTab</u>,  <u>DC</u>  (Delete),  <u>End</u>,  <u>Enter</u>,  <u>Escape</u>,  <u>F1</u>  to <u>F12</u>, <u>Home</u>, <u>IC</u> (Insert), <u>NPage/PageDown/PgDn</u>,
       <u>PPage/PageUp/PgUp</u>, <u>Space</u>, and <u>Tab</u>.  Note that to bind the ‘"’ or ‘'’ keys, quotation marks are necessary,
       for example:

             bind-key '"' split-window
             bind-key "'" new-window

       Commands related to key bindings are as follows:

       <b>bind-key</b> [<b>-cnr</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>mode-table</u>] [<b>-T</b> <u>key-table</u>] <u>key</u> <u>command</u> [<u>arguments</u>]
                     (alias: <b>bind</b>)
               Bind key <u>key</u> to <u>command</u>.  Keys are bound in a key table.  By default (without  -T),  the  key  is
               bound  in  the  <u>prefix</u>  key table.  This table is used for keys pressed after the prefix key (for
               example, by default ‘c’ is bound to <b>new-window</b> in the <u>prefix</u> table, so  ‘C-b  c’  creates  a  new
               window).   The  <u>root</u>  table  is  used  for  keys  pressed  without the prefix key: binding ‘c’ to
               <b>new-window</b> in the <u>root</u> table (not recommended) means a plain ‘c’ will create a new window.  <b>-n</b> is
               an alias for <b>-T</b> <u>root</u>.  Keys may also be bound in custom  key  tables  and  the  <b>switch-client</b>  <b>-T</b>
               command  used  to  switch to them from a key binding.  The <b>-r</b> flag indicates this key may repeat,
               see the <b>repeat-time</b> option.

               If <b>-t</b> is present, <u>key</u> is bound in <u>mode-table</u>: the binding for command mode with <b>-c</b> or for  normal
               mode  without.   See the “WINDOWS AND PANES” section and the <b>list-keys</b> command for information on
               mode key bindings.

               To view the default bindings and possible commands, see the <b>list-keys</b> command.

       <b>list-keys</b> [<b>-t</b> <u>mode-table</u>] [<b>-T</b> <u>key-table</u>]
                     (alias: <b>lsk</b>)
               List all key bindings.  Without <b>-T</b> all key tables are printed.  With <b>-T</b> only <u>key-table</u>.

               With <b>-t</b>, the key bindings in <u>mode-table</u> are listed; this may  be  one  of:  <u>vi-edit</u>,  <u>emacs-edit</u>,
               <u>vi-choice</u>, <u>emacs-choice</u>, <u>vi-copy</u> or <u>emacs-copy</u>.

       <b>send-keys</b> [<b>-lMR</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>] <u>key</u> <u>...</u>
                     (alias: <b>send</b>)
               Send  a  key  or  keys  to  a window.  Each argument <u>key</u> is the name of the key (such as ‘C-a’ or
               ‘npage’ ) to send; if the string is not  recognised  as  a  key,  it  is  sent  as  a  series  of
               characters.   The  <b>-l</b>  flag disables key name lookup and sends the keys literally.  All arguments
               are sent sequentially from first to last.  The <b>-R</b> flag causes the terminal state to be reset.

               <b>-M</b> passes through a mouse event (only  valid  if  bound  to  a  mouse  key  binding,  see  “MOUSE
               SUPPORT”).

       <b>send-prefix</b> [<b>-2</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>]
               Send the prefix key, or with <b>-2</b> the secondary prefix key, to a window as if it was pressed.

       <b>unbind-key</b> [<b>-acn</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>mode-table</u>] [<b>-T</b> <u>key-table</u>] <u>key</u>
                     (alias: <b>unbind</b>)
               Unbind  the  command  bound  to  <u>key</u>.   <b>-c</b>, <b>-n</b>, <b>-T</b> and <b>-t</b> are the same as for <b>bind-key</b>.  If <b>-a</b> is
               present, all key bindings are removed.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The appearance and behaviour of <b>tmate</b> may be modified by changing the value of  various  options.   There
       are three types of option: <u>server</u> <u>options</u>, <u>session</u> <u>options</u> and <u>window</u> <u>options</u>.

       The  <b>tmate</b>  server  has  a  set of global options which do not apply to any particular window or session.
       These are altered with the <b>set-option</b> <b>-s</b> command, or displayed with the <b>show-options</b> <b>-s</b> command.

       In addition, each individual session may have a set of session options, and there is a  separate  set  of
       global session options.  Sessions which do not have a particular option configured inherit the value from
       the  global  session  options.   Session  options are set or unset with the <b>set-option</b> command and may be
       listed with the <b>show-options</b> command.  The available server and session  options  are  listed  under  the
       <b>set-option</b> command.

       Similarly,  a  set  of  window  options  is  attached to each window, and there is a set of global window
       options  from  which  any  unset  options  are  inherited.   Window  options   are   altered   with   the
       <b>set-window-option</b> command and can be listed with the <b>show-window-options</b> command.  All window options are
       documented with the <b>set-window-option</b> command.

       <b>tmate</b>  also supports user options which are prefixed with a ‘@’.  User options may have any name, so long
       as they are prefixed with ‘@’, and be set to any string.  For example:

             $ tmate setw -q @foo "abc123"
             $ tmate showw -v @foo
             abc123

       Commands which set options are as follows:

       <b>set-option</b> [<b>-agoqsuw</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-session</u> | <u>target-window</u>] <u>option</u> <u>value</u>
                     (alias: <b>set</b>)
               Set a window option with <b>-w</b> (equivalent to the <b>set-window-option</b> command), a server  option  with
               <b>-s</b>, otherwise a session option.  If <b>-g</b> is given, the global session or window option is set.  The
               <b>-u</b>  flag  unsets an option, so a session inherits the option from the global options (or with <b>-g</b>,
               restores a global option to the default).

               The <b>-o</b> flag prevents setting an option that is already set and  the  <b>-q</b>  flag  suppresses  errors
               about unknown or ambiguous options.

               With  <b>-a</b>,  and  if  the  option  expects  a  string or a style, <u>value</u> is appended to the existing
               setting.  For example:

                     set -g status-left "foo"
                     set -ag status-left "bar"

               Will result in ‘foobar’.  And:

                     set -g status-style "bg=red"
                     set -ag status-style "fg=blue"

               Will result in a red background <u>and</u> blue foreground.  Without <b>-a</b>, the result would be the default
               background and a blue foreground.

               Available window options are listed under <b>set-window-option</b>.

               <u>value</u> depends on the option and may be a number, a string, or a flag  (on,  off,  or  omitted  to
               toggle).

               Available server options are:

               <b>buffer-limit</b> <u>number</u>
                       Set the number of buffers; as new buffers are added to the top of the stack, old ones are
                       removed from the bottom if necessary to maintain this maximum length.

               <b>default-terminal</b> <u>terminal</u>
                       Set  the  default terminal for new windows created in this session - the default value of
                       the TERM environment variable.  For  <b>tmate</b>  to  work  correctly,  this  <u>must</u>  be  set  to
                       ‘screen’, ‘tmux’, ‘tmate’ or a derivative of them.

               <b>escape-time</b> <u>time</u>
                       Set  the time in milliseconds for which <b>tmate</b> waits after an escape is input to determine
                       if it is part of a function or meta key sequences.  The default is 500 milliseconds.

               <b>exit-unattached</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
                       If enabled, the server will exit when there are no attached clients.

               <b>focus-events</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
                       When enabled, focus events are requested  from  the  terminal  if  supported  and  passed
                       through  to  applications  running  in  <b>tmate</b>.   Attached  clients should be detached and
                       attached again after changing this option.

               <b>history-file</b> <u>path</u>
                       If not empty, a file to which <b>tmate</b> will write command prompt history on exit and load it
                       from on start.

               <b>message-limit</b> <u>number</u>
                       Set the number of error or information messages to save  in  the  message  log  for  each
                       client.  The default is 100.

               <b>set-clipboard</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
                       Attempt  to  set  the  terminal clipboard content using the \e]52;...\007 <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1) escape
                       sequences.  This option is on by default if there is  an  <u>Ms</u>  entry  in  the  <u><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></u>(5)
                       description  for  the  client  terminal.   Note  that this feature needs to be enabled in
                       <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1) by setting the resource:

                             disallowedWindowOps: 20,21,SetXprop

                       Or changing this property from the <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1) interactive menu when required.

               <b>terminal-overrides</b> <u>string</u>
                       Contains a list of entries which override terminal descriptions read  using  <u><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></u>(5).
                       <u>string</u>  is  a  comma-separated  list  of items each a colon-separated string made up of a
                       terminal type pattern (matched using <u><a href="../man3/fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch</a></u>(3)) and a set of <u>name=value</u> entries.

                       For example, to set the ‘clear’ <u><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></u>(5) entry to ‘\e[H\e[2J’ for all  terminal  types
                       and  the  ‘dch1’ entry to ‘\e[P’ for the ‘rxvt’ terminal type, the option could be set to
                       the string:

                             "*:clear=\e[H\e[2J,rxvt:dch1=\e[P"

                       The terminal entry value  is  passed  through  <u><a href="../man3/strunvis.3.html">strunvis</a></u>(3)  before  interpretation.   The
                       default  value  forcibly  corrects  the  ‘colors’  entry  for terminals which support 256
                       colours:

                             "*256col*:colors=256,xterm*:XT"

               Available session options are:

               <b>assume-paste-time</b> <u>milliseconds</u>
                       If keys are entered faster than one in <u>milliseconds</u>, they are assumed to have been pasted
                       rather than typed and  <b>tmate</b>  key  bindings  are  not  processed.   The  default  is  one
                       millisecond and zero disables.

               <b>base-index</b> <u>index</u>
                       Set  the  base  index  from which an unused index should be searched when a new window is
                       created.  The default is zero.

               <b>bell-action</b> [<b>any</b> | <b>none</b> | <b>current</b> | <b>other</b>]
                       Set action on window bell.  <b>any</b> means a bell in any window linked to a session  causes  a
                       bell  in  the  current  window of that session, <b>none</b> means all bells are ignored, <b>current</b>
                       means only bells in windows other than the current window are  ignored  and  <b>other</b>  means
                       bells in the current window are ignored but not those in other windows.

               <b>bell-on-alert</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
                       If on, ring the terminal bell when an alert occurs.

               <b>default-command</b> <u>shell-command</u>
                       Set  the  command  used  for new windows (if not specified when the window is created) to
                       <u>shell-command</u>, which may be any <u><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></u>(1) command.  The default is  an  empty  string,  which
                       instructs <b>tmate</b> to create a login shell using the value of the <b>default-shell</b> option.

               <b>default-shell</b> <u>path</u>
                       Specify  the  default  shell.   This  is used as the login shell for new windows when the
                       <b>default-command</b> option is set to empty, and must be the  full  path  of  the  executable.
                       When  started  <b>tmate</b>  tries  to  set a default value from the first suitable of the SHELL
                       environment variable, the shell returned by <u><a href="../man3/getpwuid.3.html">getpwuid</a></u>(3), or <u><a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a></u>.  This option  should
                       be configured when <b>tmate</b> is used as a login shell.

               <b>destroy-unattached</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
                       If enabled and the session is no longer attached to any clients, it is destroyed.

               <b>detach-on-destroy</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
                       If  on  (the  default),  the  client  is  detached  when the session it is attached to is
                       destroyed.  If off, the client is switched to the most recently active of  the  remaining
                       sessions.

               <b>display-panes-active-colour</b> <u>colour</u>
                       Set  the  colour  used  by the <b>display-panes</b> command to show the indicator for the active
                       pane.

               <b>display-panes-colour</b> <u>colour</u>
                       Set the colour used by the <b>display-panes</b> command to  show  the  indicators  for  inactive
                       panes.

               <b>display-panes-time</b> <u>time</u>
                       Set  the time in milliseconds for which the indicators shown by the <b>display-panes</b> command
                       appear.

               <b>display-time</b> <u>time</u>
                       Set the amount of time for which status line messages and other on-screen indicators  are
                       displayed.   If  set  to 0, messages and indicators are displayed until a key is pressed.
                       <u>time</u> is in milliseconds.

               <b>history-limit</b> <u>lines</u>
                       Set the maximum number of lines held in window history.  This setting applies only to new
                       windows - existing window histories are not resized and retain the  limit  at  the  point
                       they were created.

               <b>key-table</b> <u>key-table</u>
                       Set the default key table to <u>key-table</u> instead of <u>root</u>.

               <b>lock-after-time</b> <u>number</u>
                       Lock the session (like the <b>lock-session</b> command) after <u>number</u> seconds of inactivity.  The
                       default is not to lock (set to 0).

               <b>lock-command</b> <u>shell-command</u>
                       Command to run when locking each client.  The default is to run <u><a href="../man1/lock.1.html">lock</a></u>(1) with <b>-np</b>.

               <b>message-command-style</b> <u>style</u>
                       Set  status  line  message  command  style,  where  <u>style</u>  is  a  comma-separated list of
                       characteristics to be specified.

                       These may be ‘bg=colour’ to set the background colour, ‘fg=colour’ to set the  foreground
                       colour, and a list of attributes as specified below.

                       The  colour  is  one  of:  <b>black</b>, <b>red</b>, <b>green</b>, <b>yellow</b>, <b>blue</b>, <b>magenta</b>, <b>cyan</b>, <b>white</b>, aixterm
                       bright variants (if supported: <b>brightred</b>, <b>brightgreen</b>, and so on), <b>colour0</b>  to  <b>colour255</b>
                       from  the  256-colour  set, <b>default</b>, or a hexadecimal RGB string such as ‘#ffffff’, which
                       chooses the closest match from the default 256-colour set.

                       The attributes is either <b>none</b> or a comma-delimited list of one or  more  of:  <b>bright</b>  (or
                       <b>bold</b>),  <b>dim</b>,  <b>underscore</b>, <b>blink</b>, <b>reverse</b>, <b>hidden</b>, or <b>italics</b>, to turn an attribute on, or
                       an attribute prefixed with ‘no’ to turn one off.

                       Examples are:

                             fg=yellow,bold,underscore,blink
                             bg=black,fg=default,noreverse

                       With the <b>-a</b> flag to the <b>set-option</b> command the new style is added otherwise the  existing
                       style is replaced.

               <b>message-style</b> <u>style</u>
                       Set  status  line message style.  For how to specify <u>style</u>, see the <b>message-command-style</b>
                       option.

               <b>mouse</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
                       If on, <b>tmate</b> captures the mouse and allows mouse events to be bound as key bindings.  See
                       the “MOUSE SUPPORT” section for details.

               <b>prefix</b> <u>key</u>
                       Set the key accepted as a prefix key.  In addition to the standard keys  described  under
                       “KEY BINDINGS”, <b>prefix</b> can be set to the special key ‘None’ to set no prefix.

               <b>prefix2</b> <u>key</u>
                       Set a secondary key accepted as a prefix key.  Like <b>prefix</b>, <b>prefix2</b> can be set to ‘None’.

               <b>renumber-windows</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
                       If  on, when a window is closed in a session, automatically renumber the other windows in
                       numerical order.  This respects the <b>base-index</b> option if it has been set.  If off, do not
                       renumber the windows.

               <b>repeat-time</b> <u>time</u>
                       Allow multiple commands to be entered  without  pressing  the  prefix-key  again  in  the
                       specified  <u>time</u> milliseconds (the default is 500).  Whether a key repeats may be set when
                       it is bound using the <b>-r</b> flag to <b>bind-key</b>.  Repeat is enabled for the default keys  bound
                       to the <b>resize-pane</b> command.

               <b>set-remain-on-exit</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
                       Set the <b>remain-on-exit</b> window option for any windows first created in this session.  When
                       this  option  is  true,  windows  in  which  the running program has exited do not close,
                       instead remaining open but inactivate.  Use the <b>respawn-window</b> command to reactivate such
                       a window, or the <b>kill-window</b> command to destroy it.

               <b>set-titles</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
                       Attempt to set the client terminal title using the <u>tsl</u> and  <u>fsl</u>  <u><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></u>(5)  entries  if
                       they  exist.  <b>tmate</b> automatically sets these to the \e]0;...\007 sequence if the terminal
                       appears to be <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1).  This option is off by default.

               <b>set-titles-string</b> <u>string</u>
                       String used to set the window title if <b>set-titles</b> is on.  Formats are expanded,  see  the
                       “FORMATS” section.

               <b>status</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
                       Show or hide the status line.

               <b>status-interval</b> <u>interval</u>
                       Update  the  status  bar every <u>interval</u> seconds.  By default, updates will occur every 15
                       seconds.  A setting of zero disables redrawing at interval.

               <b>status-justify</b> [<b>left</b> | <b>centre</b> | <b>right</b>]
                       Set the position of the window list component of the status line: left, centre  or  right
                       justified.

               <b>status-keys</b> [<b>vi</b> | <b>emacs</b>]
                       Use vi or emacs-style key bindings in the status line, for example at the command prompt.
                       The  default  is  emacs,  unless  the  VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables are set and
                       contain the string ‘vi’.

               <b>status-left</b> <u>string</u>
                       Display <u>string</u> (by default the session name) to the left of the status bar.  <u>string</u>  will
                       be  passed through <u><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a></u>(3) and formats (see “FORMATS”) will be expanded.  It may also
                       contain any of the following special character sequences:

                             <b>Character</b> <b>pair</b>    <b>Replaced</b> <b>with</b>
                             <b>#[attributes]</b>     Colour or attribute change
                             <b>##</b>                A literal ‘#’

                       For details on how the names and titles can be set see the “NAMES  AND  TITLES”  section.
                       For a list of allowed attributes see the <b>message-command-style</b> option.

                       Examples are:

                             #(sysctl vm.loadavg)
                             #[fg=yellow,bold]#(apm -l)%%#[default] [#S]

                       The default is ‘[#S] ’.

               <b>status-left-length</b> <u>length</u>
                       Set the maximum <u>length</u> of the left component of the status bar.  The default is 10.

               <b>status-left-style</b> <u>style</u>
                       Set  the  style  of  the left part of the status line.  For how to specify <u>style</u>, see the
                       <b>message-command-style</b> option.

               <b>status-position</b> [<b>top</b> | <b>bottom</b>]
                       Set the position of the status line.

               <b>status-right</b> <u>string</u>
                       Display <u>string</u> to the right of the status bar.  By default, the current window  title  in
                       double  quotes,  the  date  and  the time are shown.  As with <b>status-left</b>, <u>string</u> will be
                       passed to <u><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a></u>(3) and character pairs are replaced.

               <b>status-right-length</b> <u>length</u>
                       Set the maximum <u>length</u> of the right component of the status bar.  The default is 40.

               <b>status-right-style</b> <u>style</u>
                       Set the style of the right part of the status line.  For how to specify  <u>style</u>,  see  the
                       <b>message-command-style</b> option.

               <b>status-style</b> <u>style</u>
                       Set status line style.  For how to specify <u>style</u>, see the <b>message-command-style</b> option.

               <b>update-environment</b> <u>variables</u>
                       Set a space-separated string containing a list of environment variables to be copied into
                       the session environment when a new session is created or an existing session is attached.
                       Any  variables that do not exist in the source environment are set to be removed from the
                       session environment (as if <b>-r</b> was given to the <b>set-environment</b> command).  The default  is
                       "DISPLAY SSH_ASKPASS SSH_AUTH_SOCK SSH_AGENT_PID SSH_CONNECTION WINDOWID XAUTHORITY".

               <b>visual-activity</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
                       If  on,  display  a  status  line  message when activity occurs in a window for which the
                       <b>monitor-activity</b> window option is enabled.

               <b>visual-bell</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
                       If this option is on, a message is shown on a bell instead of it being passed through  to
                       the terminal (which normally makes a sound).  Also see the <b>bell-action</b> option.

               <b>visual-silence</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
                       If <b>monitor-silence</b> is enabled, prints a message after the interval has expired on a given
                       window.

               <b>word-separators</b> <u>string</u>
                       Sets  the session's conception of what characters are considered word separators, for the
                       purposes of the next and previous word commands in copy mode.  The default is ‘ -_@’.

       <b>set-window-option</b> [<b>-agoqu</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-window</u>] <u>option</u> <u>value</u>
                     (alias: <b>setw</b>)
               Set a window option.  The <b>-a</b>, <b>-g</b>, <b>-o</b>, <b>-q</b> and <b>-u</b> flags work similarly to the <b>set-option</b> command.

               Supported window options are:

               <b>aggressive-resize</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
                       Aggressively resize the chosen window.  This means that <b>tmate</b> will resize the  window  to
                       the  size  of  the  smallest  session for which it is the current window, rather than the
                       smallest session to which it is attached.  The window may resize when the current  window
                       is  changed  on  another  sessions;  this  option  is good for full-screen programs which
                       support SIGWINCH and poor for interactive programs such as shells.

               <b>allow-rename</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
                       Allow programs to change the window name using a terminal escape  sequence  (\ek...\e\\).
                       The default is on.

               <b>alternate-screen</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
                       This  option  configures  whether  programs  running  inside  <b>tmate</b>  may use the terminal
                       alternate screen feature, which allows the <u>smcup</u> and <u>rmcup</u> <u><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></u>(5) capabilities.  The
                       alternate screen feature preserves  the  contents  of  the  window  when  an  interactive
                       application  starts  and  restores  it  on  exit,  so  that any output visible before the
                       application starts reappears unchanged after it exits.  The default is on.

               <b>automatic-rename</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
                       Control automatic window renaming.  When this setting is enabled, <b>tmate</b> will  rename  the
                       window automatically using the format specified by <b>automatic-rename-format</b>.  This flag is
                       automatically disabled for an individual window when a name is specified at creation with
                       <b>new-window</b>  or  <b>new-session</b>,  or  later  with  <b>rename-window</b>,  or  with a terminal escape
                       sequence.  It may be switched off globally with:

                             set-window-option -g automatic-rename off

               <b>automatic-rename-format</b> <u>format</u>
                       The format (see “FORMATS”) used when the <b>automatic-rename</b> option is enabled.

               <b>clock-mode-colour</b> <u>colour</u>
                       Set clock colour.

               <b>clock-mode-style</b> [<b>12</b> | <b>24</b>]
                       Set clock hour format.

               <b>force-height</b> <u>height</u>
               <b>force-width</b> <u>width</u>
                       Prevent <b>tmate</b> from resizing a window to greater than <u>width</u> or <u>height</u>.  A  value  of  zero
                       restores the default unlimited setting.

               <b>main-pane-height</b> <u>height</u>
               <b>main-pane-width</b> <u>width</u>
                       Set  the  width  or  height  of  the  main  (left  or top) pane in the <b>main-horizontal</b> or
                       <b>main-vertical</b> layouts.

               <b>mode-keys</b> [<b>vi</b> | <b>emacs</b>]
                       Use vi or emacs-style key bindings in copy and choice modes.   As  with  the  <b>status-keys</b>
                       option, the default is emacs, unless VISUAL or EDITOR contains ‘vi’.

               <b>mode-style</b> <u>style</u>
                       Set window modes style.  For how to specify <u>style</u>, see the <b>message-command-style</b> option.

               <b>monitor-activity</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
                       Monitor  for activity in the window.  Windows with activity are highlighted in the status
                       line.

               <b>monitor-silence</b> [<b>interval</b>]
                       Monitor for silence (no activity) in the window within <b>interval</b>  seconds.   Windows  that
                       have  been  silent  for  the interval are highlighted in the status line.  An interval of
                       zero disables the monitoring.

               <b>other-pane-height</b> <u>height</u>
                       Set the height of the other panes (not the main pane) in the <b>main-horizontal</b> layout.   If
                       this  option  is  set  to  0  (the  default),  it  will  have  no  effect.   If  both the
                       <b>main-pane-height</b> and <b>other-pane-height</b> options are set, the main pane will grow taller to
                       make the other panes the specified height, but will never shrink to do so.

               <b>other-pane-width</b> <u>width</u>
                       Like <b>other-pane-height</b>, but set the width of other panes in the <b>main-vertical</b> layout.

               <b>pane-active-border-style</b> <u>style</u>
                       Set the pane border style for the currently active pane.  For how to specify  <u>style</u>,  see
                       the <b>message-command-style</b> option.  Attributes are ignored.

               <b>pane-base-index</b> <u>index</u>
                       Like <b>base-index</b>, but set the starting index for pane numbers.

               <b>pane-border-style</b> <u>style</u>
                       Set  the  pane  border  style  for  panes aside from the active pane.  For how to specify
                       <u>style</u>, see the <b>message-command-style</b> option.  Attributes are ignored.

               <b>remain-on-exit</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
                       A window with this flag set is not destroyed when the program running in it  exits.   The
                       window may be reactivated with the <b>respawn-window</b> command.

               <b>synchronize-panes</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
                       Duplicate  input  to  any pane to all other panes in the same window (only for panes that
                       are not in any special mode).

               <b>window-active-style</b> <u>style</u>
                       Set the style for  the  window's  active  pane.   For  how  to  specify  <u>style</u>,  see  the
                       <b>message-command-style</b> option.

               <b>window-status-activity-style</b> <u>style</u>
                       Set  status line style for windows with an activity alert.  For how to specify <u>style</u>, see
                       the <b>message-command-style</b> option.

               <b>window-status-bell-style</b> <u>style</u>
                       Set status line style for windows with a bell alert.  For how to specify <u>style</u>,  see  the

               <b>xterm-keys</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
                       If  this option is set, <b>tmate</b> will generate <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1) -style function key sequences; these
                       have a number included to indicate modifiers such as Shift, Alt or Ctrl.  The default  is
                       off.

               <b>wrap-search</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
                       If  this  option  is  set,  searches  will wrap around the end of the pane contents.  The
                       default is on.

       <b>show-options</b> [<b>-gqsvw</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-session</u> | <u>target-window</u>] [<u>option</u>]
                     (alias: <b>show</b>)
               Show  the  window  options  (or  a  single  window  option  if  given)  with  <b>-w</b>  (equivalent  to
               <b>show-window-options</b>),  the  server  options  with  <b>-s</b>,  otherwise  the session options for <u>target</u>
               <u>session</u>.  Global session or window options are listed if <b>-g</b> is used.  <b>-v</b> shows  only  the  option
               value, not the name.  If <b>-q</b> is set, no error will be returned if <u>option</u> is unset.

       <b>show-window-options</b> [<b>-gv</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-window</u>] [<u>option</u>]
                     (alias: <b>showw</b>)
               List  the window options or a single option for <u>target-window</u>, or the global window options if <b>-g</b>
               is used.  <b>-v</b> shows only the option value, not the name.

</pre><h4><b>HOOKS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tmate</b> allows commands to run on various triggers, called <u>hooks</u>.  Each hook has  a  <u>name</u>.   The  following
       hooks are available:

       alert-activity    Run when a window has activity.  See <b>monitor-activity</b>.

       alert-bell        Run when a window has received a bell.

       alert-silence     Run when a window has been silent.  See <b>monitor-silence</b>.

       client-attached   Run when a client is attached.

       client-detached   Run when a client is detached

       client-resized    Run when a client is resized.

       pane-died         Run  when the program running in a pane exits, but <b>remain-on-exit</b> is on so the pane has
                         not closed.

       pane-exited       Run when the program running in a pane exits.

       Hooks are managed with these commands:

       <b>set-hook</b> [<b>-g</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-session</u>] <u>hook-name</u> <u>command</u>
               Sets hook <u>hook-name</u> to <u>command</u>.  If <b>-g</b> is given, <u>hook-name</u> is added to the global list of  hooks,
               otherwise  it  is added to the session hooks (for <u>target-session</u> with <b>-t</b>).  Like options, session
               hooks inherit from the global ones.

       <b>show-hooks</b> [<b>-g</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-session</u>]
               Shows the global list of hooks with <b>-g</b>, otherwise the session hooks.

</pre><h4><b>MOUSE</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       If the <b>mouse</b> option is on (the default is off), <b>tmate</b> allows mouse events to be bound as keys.  The  name
       of each key is made up of a mouse event (such as ‘MouseUp1’) and a location suffix (one of ‘Pane’ for the
       contents  of  a  pane,  ‘Border’ for a pane border or ‘Status’ for the status line).  The following mouse
       events are available:

             <b>MouseDown1</b>    MouseUp1      MouseDrag1   MouseDragEnd1
             <b>MouseDown2</b>    MouseUp2      MouseDrag2   MouseDragEnd2
             <b>MouseDown3</b>    MouseUp3      MouseDrag3   MouseDragEnd3
             <b>WheelUp</b>       WheelDown

       Each should be suffixed with a location, for example ‘MouseDown1Status’.

       The special token ‘{mouse}’ or ‘=’ may be used as <u>target-window</u> or <u>target-pane</u> in commands bound to mouse
       key bindings.  It resolves to the window or pane over which the mouse event took place (for example,  the
       window  in  the  status line over which button 1 was released for a ‘MouseUp1Status’ binding, or the pane
       over which the wheel was scrolled for a ‘WheelDownPane’ binding).

       The <b>send-keys</b> <b>-M</b> flag may be used to forward a mouse event to a pane.

       The default key bindings allow the mouse to be used to select and resize  panes,  to  copy  text  and  to
       change window using the status line.  These take effect if the <b>mouse</b> option is turned on.

</pre><h4><b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       Certain  commands  accept the <b>-F</b> flag with a <u>format</u> argument.  This is a string which controls the output
       format  of  the  command.   Replacement  variables  are  enclosed  in   ‘#{’   and   ‘}’,   for   example
       ‘#{session_name}’.   The  possible variables are listed in the table below, or the name of a <b>tmate</b> option
       may be used for an option's value.  Some variables have a  shorter  alias  such  as  ‘#S’,  and  ‘##’  is
       replaced by a single ‘#’.

       Conditionals  are  available  by  prefixing with ‘?’ and separating two alternatives with a comma; if the
       specified variable exists and is not zero, the first alternative is chosen, otherwise the second is used.
       For example ‘#{?session_attached,attached,not attached}’  will  include  the  string  ‘attached’  if  the
       session  is  attached and the string ‘not attached’ if it is unattached, or ‘#{?automatic-rename,yes,no}’
       will include ‘yes’ if <b>automatic-rename</b> is enabled, or ‘no’ if not.

       A limit may be placed on the length of the resultant string by prefixing it by an ‘=’,  a  number  and  a
       colon.    Positive  numbers  count  from  the  start  of  the  string  and  negative  from  the  end,  so
       ‘#{=5:pane_title}’ will include at most the first 5 characters of the pane title, or  ‘#{=-5:pane_title}’
       the  last  5  characters.   Prefixing  a  time  variable  with  ‘t:’  will  convert it to a string, so if
       ‘#{window_activity}’ gives ‘1445765102’, ‘#{t:window_activity}’ gives ‘Sun Oct 25  09:25:02  2015’.   The
       ‘b:’ and ‘d:’ prefixes are <u><a href="../man3/basename.3.html">basename</a></u>(3) and <u><a href="../man3/dirname.3.html">dirname</a></u>(3) of the variable respectively.  A prefix of the form
       ‘s/foo/bar/:’ will substitute ‘foo’ with ‘bar’ throughout.

       In  addition,  the  first  line  of  a  shell command's output may be inserted using ‘#()’.  For example,
       ‘#(uptime)’ will insert the system's uptime.  When constructing formats, <b>tmate</b> does not  wait  for  ‘#()’
       commands  to finish; instead, the previous result from running the same command is used, or a placeholder
       if the command has not been run before.  Commands are executed with the <b>tmate</b> global environment set (see
       the “ENVIRONMENT” section).

       The following variables are available, where appropriate:

       <b>Variable</b> <b>name</b>          <b>Alias</b>    <b>Replaced</b> <b>with</b>
       <b>alternate_on</b>                    If pane is in alternate screen

</pre><h4><b>NAMES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>TITLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tmate</b> distinguishes between names and titles.  Windows and sessions have names,  which  may  be  used  to
       specify  them  in  targets  and are displayed in the status line and various lists: the name is the <b>tmate</b>
       identifier for a window or session.  Only panes have titles.  A pane's title  is  typically  set  by  the
       program  running  inside the pane and is not modified by <b>tmate</b>.  It is the same mechanism used to set for
       example the <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1) window title in an <u><a href="../man7/X.7.html">X</a></u>(7) window manager.  Windows themselves do not have titles  -  a
       window's  title is the title of its active pane.  <b>tmate</b> itself may set the title of the terminal in which
       the client is running, see the <b>set-titles</b> option.

       A session's name is set with the <b>new-session</b> and <b>rename-session</b> commands.  A window's name  is  set  with
       one of:

       1.      A command argument (such as <b>-n</b> for <b>new-window</b> or <b>new-session</b>).

       2.      An escape sequence:

                     $ printf '\033kWINDOW_NAME\033\\'

       3.      Automatic  renaming,  which sets the name to the active command in the window's active pane.  See
               the <b>automatic-rename</b> option.

       When a pane is first created, its title is the hostname.  A pane's title can be set  via  the  OSC  title
       setting sequence, for example:

             $ printf '\033]2;My Title\033\\'

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       When  the  server is started, <b>tmate</b> copies the environment into the <u>global</u> <u>environment</u>; in addition, each
       session has a <u>session</u> <u>environment</u>.  When a window is created, the session  and  global  environments  are
       merged.  If a variable exists in both, the value from the session environment is used.  The result is the
       initial environment passed to the new process.

       The  <b>update-environment</b> session option may be used to update the session environment from the client when
       a new session is created or an old reattached.  <b>tmate</b>  also  initialises  the  TMUX  variable  with  some
       internal information to allow commands to be executed from inside, and the TERM variable with the correct
       terminal setting of ‘screen’.

       Commands to alter and view the environment are:

       <b>set-environment</b> [<b>-gru</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-session</u>] <u>name</u> [<u>value</u>]
                     (alias: <b>setenv</b>)
               Set  or  unset  an  environment  variable.   If  <b>-g</b>  is  used,  the  change is made in the global
               environment; otherwise, it is applied to the session environment for <u>target-session</u>.  The <b>-u</b> flag
               unsets a variable.  <b>-r</b> indicates the variable is  to  be  removed  from  the  environment  before
               starting a new process.

       <b>show-environment</b> [<b>-gs</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-session</u>] [<u>variable</u>]
                     (alias: <b>showenv</b>)
               Display  the  environment  for  <u>target-session</u> or the global environment with <b>-g</b>.  If <u>variable</u> is
               omitted, all variables are shown.  Variables removed from the environment are prefixed with  ‘-’.
               If <b>-s</b> is used, the output is formatted as a set of Bourne shell commands.

</pre><h4><b>STATUS</b> <b>LINE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tmate</b>  includes  an  optional  status  line  which  is displayed in the bottom line of each terminal.  By
       default, the status line is enabled (it may be disabled with the <b>status</b>  session  option)  and  contains,
       from left-to-right: the name of the current session in square brackets; the window list; the title of the
       active pane in double quotes; and the time and date.

       The  status  line is made of three parts: configurable left and right sections (which may contain dynamic
       content such as the time or output  from  a  shell  command,  see  the  <b>status-left</b>,  <b>status-left-length</b>,
       <b>status-right</b>,  and <b>status-right-length</b> options below), and a central window list.  By default, the window
       list shows the index, name and (if any) flag of the windows present in the current session  in  ascending
       numerical  order.   It  may  be customised with the <u>window-status-format</u> and <u>window-status-current-format</u>
       options.  The flag is one of the following symbols appended to the window name:

             <b>Symbol</b>    <b>Meaning</b>
             <b>*</b>         Denotes the current window.
             <b>-</b>         Marks the last window (previously selected).
             <b>#</b>         Window is monitored and activity has been detected.
             !         A bell has occurred in the window.
             <b>~</b>         The window has been silent for the monitor-silence interval.
             <b>M</b>         The window contains the marked pane.
             <b>Z</b>         The window's active pane is zoomed.

       The # symbol relates to the <b>monitor-activity</b> window option.  The  window  name  is  printed  in  inverted
       colours if an alert (bell, activity or silence) is present.

       The  colour  and  attributes  of  the  status  line  may  be configured, the entire status line using the
       <b>status-style</b> session option and individual windows using the <b>window-status-style</b> window option.

       The status line is automatically refreshed at interval if it has changed, the interval may be  controlled
       with the <b>status-interval</b> session option.

       Commands related to the status line are as follows:

       <b>command-prompt</b> [<b>-I</b> <u>inputs</u>] [<b>-p</b> <u>prompts</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-client</u>] [<u>template</u>]
               Open  the  command  prompt  in  a client.  This may be used from inside <b>tmate</b> to execute commands
               interactively.

               If <u>template</u> is specified, it is used as the command.  If present, <b>-I</b> is a comma-separated list of
               the initial text for each prompt.  If <b>-p</b> is given, <u>prompts</u> is a comma-separated list  of  prompts
               which  are  displayed in order; otherwise a single prompt is displayed, constructed from <u>template</u>
               if it is present, or ‘:’ if not.

               Both <u>inputs</u> and <u>prompts</u> may contain the special character sequences supported by the  <b>status-left</b>
               option.

               Before  the  command  is executed, the first occurrence of the string ‘%%’ and all occurrences of
               ‘%1’ are replaced by the response to the first prompt, the second ‘%%’ and all ‘%2’ are  replaced
               with  the  response  to  the  second  prompt,  and  so on for further prompts.  Up to nine prompt
               responses may be replaced (‘%1’ to ‘%9’).

       <b>confirm-before</b> [<b>-p</b> <u>prompt</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-client</u>] <u>command</u>
                     (alias: <b>confirm</b>)
               Ask for confirmation before executing <u>command</u>.  If <b>-p</b> is given, <u>prompt</u> is the prompt to  display;
               otherwise  a  prompt is constructed from <u>command</u>.  It may contain the special character sequences
               supported by the <b>status-left</b> option.

               This command works only from inside <b>tmate</b>.

       <b>display-message</b> [<b>-p</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>target-client</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>] [<u>message</u>]
                     (alias: <b>display</b>)
               Display a message.  If <b>-p</b> is given, the output is printed to stdout, otherwise it is displayed in
               the <u>target-client</u> status line.  The format of <u>message</u> is  described  in  the  “FORMATS”  section;
               information  is  taken from <u>target-pane</u> if <b>-t</b> is given, otherwise the active pane for the session
               attached to <u>target-client</u>.

</pre><h4><b>BUFFERS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tmate</b> maintains a set of named <u>paste</u> <u>buffers</u>.  Each buffer may  be  either  explicitly  or  automatically
       named.   Explicitly  named buffers are named when created with the <b>set-buffer</b> or <b>load-buffer</b> commands, or
       by renaming an automatically named buffer with <b>set-buffer</b> <b>-n</b>.  Automatically named buffers  are  given  a
       name  such  as ‘buffer0001’, ‘buffer0002’ and so on.  When the <b>buffer-limit</b> option is reached, the oldest
       automatically named buffer is deleted.  Explicitly named are not  subject  to  <b>buffer-limit</b>  and  may  be
       deleted with <b>delete-buffer</b> command.

       Buffers may be added using <b>copy-mode</b> or the <b>set-buffer</b> and <b>load-buffer</b> commands, and pasted into a window
       using  the  <b>paste-buffer</b>  command.   If  a  buffer  command  is used and no buffer is specified, the most
       recently added automatically named buffer is assumed.

       A configurable history buffer is also maintained for each window.  By default, up to 2000 lines are kept;
       this can be altered with the <b>history-limit</b> option (see the <b>set-option</b> command above).

       The buffer commands are as follows:

       <b>choose-buffer</b> [<b>-F</b> <u>format</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-window</u>] [<u>template</u>]
               Put a window into buffer choice mode, where a buffer may be chosen  interactively  from  a  list.
               After  a  buffer  is  selected,  ‘%%’  is  replaced by the buffer name in <u>template</u> and the result
               executed as a command.  If <u>template</u> is not given,  "paste-buffer  -b  '%%'"  is  used.   For  the
               meaning  of  the  <b>-F</b>  flag,  see  the “FORMATS” section.  This command works only if at least one
               client is attached.

       <b>clear-history</b> [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>]
                     (alias: <b>clearhist</b>)
               Remove and free the history for the specified pane.

       <b>delete-buffer</b> [<b>-b</b> <u>buffer-name</u>]
                     (alias: <b>deleteb</b>)
               Delete the buffer named <u>buffer-name</u>, or the most recently added automatically named buffer if not
               specified.

       <b>list-buffers</b> [<b>-F</b> <u>format</u>]
                     (alias: <b>lsb</b>)
               List the global buffers.  For the meaning of the <b>-F</b> flag, see the “FORMATS” section.

       <b>load-buffer</b> [<b>-b</b> <u>buffer-name</u>] <u>path</u>
                     (alias: <b>loadb</b>)
               Load the contents of the specified paste buffer from <u>path</u>.

       <b>paste-buffer</b> [<b>-dpr</b>] [<b>-b</b> <u>buffer-name</u>] [<b>-s</b> <u>separator</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>]
                     (alias: <b>pasteb</b>)
               Insert the contents of a paste buffer into the specified pane.  If not specified, paste into  the
               current  one.   With <b>-d</b>, also delete the paste buffer.  When output, any linefeed (LF) characters
               in the paste buffer are replaced with a separator, by default carriage  return  (CR).   A  custom
               separator may be specified using the <b>-s</b> flag.  The <b>-r</b> flag means to do no replacement (equivalent
               to  a  separator of LF).  If <b>-p</b> is specified, paste bracket control codes are inserted around the
               buffer if the application has requested bracketed paste mode.

       <b>save-buffer</b> [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-b</b> <u>buffer-name</u>] <u>path</u>
                     (alias: <b>saveb</b>)
               Save the contents of the specified paste buffer to <u>path</u>.  The <b>-a</b> option appends  to  rather  than
               overwriting the file.

       <b>set-buffer</b> [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-b</b> <u>buffer-name</u>] [<b>-n</b> <u>new-buffer-name</u>] <u>data</u>
                     (alias: <b>setb</b>)
               Set  the  contents  of  the  specified  buffer  to  <u>data</u>.   The  <b>-a</b> option appends to rather than
               overwriting the buffer.  The <b>-n</b> option renames the buffer to <u>new-buffer-name</u>.

       <b>show-buffer</b> [<b>-b</b> <u>buffer-name</u>]
                     (alias: <b>showb</b>)
               Display the contents of the specified buffer.

</pre><h4><b>MISCELLANEOUS</b></h4><pre>
       Miscellaneous commands are as follows:

       <b>clock-mode</b> [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>]
               Display a large clock.

       <b>if-shell</b> [<b>-bF</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>] <u>shell-command</u> <u>command</u> [<u>command</u>]
                     (alias: <b>if</b>)
               Execute the first <u>command</u> if <u>shell-command</u> returns  success  or  the  second  <u>command</u>  otherwise.
               Before  being  executed,  <u>shell-command</u>  is  expanded  using the rules specified in the “FORMATS”
               section, including those  relevant  to  <u>target-pane</u>.   With  <b>-b</b>,  <u>shell-command</u>  is  run  in  the
               background.

               If  <b>-F</b>  is  given, <u>shell-command</u> is not executed but considered success if neither empty nor zero
               (after formats are expanded).

       <b>lock-server</b>
                     (alias: <b>lock</b>)
               Lock each client individually by running the command specified by the <b>lock-command</b> option.

       <b>run-shell</b> [<b>-b</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>] <u>shell-command</u>
                     (alias: <b>run</b>)
               Execute <u>shell-command</u> in the background without creating a window.  Before being executed, shell-
               command is expanded using the rules specified in the “FORMATS” section.  With <b>-b</b>, the command  is
               run in the background.  After it finishes, any output to stdout is displayed in copy mode (in the
               pane specified by <b>-t</b> or the current pane if omitted).  If the command doesn't return success, the
               exit status is also displayed.

       <b>wait-for</b> [<b>-L</b> | <b>-S</b> | <b>-U</b>] <u>channel</u>
                     (alias: <b>wait</b>)
               When  used  without  options, prevents the client from exiting until woken using <b>wait-for</b> <b>-S</b> with
               the same channel.  When <b>-L</b> is used, the channel is locked and any clients that try  to  lock  the
               same  channel are made to wait until the channel is unlocked with <b>wait-for</b> <b>-U</b>.  This command only
               works from outside <b>tmate</b>.

</pre><h4><b>TERMINFO</b> <b>EXTENSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tmate</b> understands some unofficial extensions to <u><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></u>(5):

       <u>Cs</u>, <u>Cr</u>  Set the cursor colour.  The first takes a single string argument and is used to set  the  colour;
               the second takes no arguments and restores the default cursor colour.  If set, a sequence such as
               this may be used to change the cursor colour from inside <b>tmate</b>:

                     $ printf '\033]12;red\033\\'

       <u>Ss</u>, <u>Se</u>  Set  or reset the cursor style.  If set, a sequence such as this may be used to change the cursor
               to an underline:

                     $ printf '\033[4 q'

               If <u>Se</u> is not set, Ss with argument 0 will be used to reset the cursor style instead.

       <u>Tc</u>      Indicate that the terminal supports  the  ‘direct  colour’  RGB  escape  sequence  (for  example,
               \e[38;2;255;255;255m).

       <u>Ms</u>      Store  the  current  buffer  in the host terminal's selection (clipboard).  See the <u>set-clipboard</u>
               option above and the <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1) man page.

</pre><h4><b>CONTROL</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tmate</b> offers a textual interface called <u>control</u> <u>mode</u>.  This allows applications to communicate with <b>tmate</b>
       using a simple text-only protocol.

       In control mode, a client sends <b>tmate</b> commands or command sequences terminated by  newlines  on  standard
       input.   Each command will produce one block of output on standard output.  An output block consists of a
       <u>%begin</u> line followed by the output (which may be empty).  The output block ends with a  <u>%end</u>  or  <u>%error</u>.
       <u>%begin</u>  and  matching  <u>%end</u>  or  <u>%error</u>  have  two arguments: an integer time (as seconds from epoch) and
       command number.  For example:

             %begin 1363006971 2
             0: ksh* (1 panes) [80x24] [layout b25f,80x24,0,0,2] @2 (active)
             %end 1363006971 2

       In control mode, <b>tmate</b> outputs notifications.  A notification will never occur inside an output block.

       The following notifications are defined:

       <b>%exit</b> [<u>reason</u>]
               The <b>tmate</b> client is exiting immediately, either because it is not attached to any session  or  an
               error occurred.  If present, <u>reason</u> describes why the client exited.

       <b>%layout-change</b> <u>window-id</u> <u>window-layout</u> <u>window-visible-layout</u> <u>window-flags</u>
               The layout of a window with ID <u>window-id</u> changed.  The new layout is <u>window-layout</u>.  The window's
               visible layout is <u>window-visible-layout</u> and the window flags are <u>window-flags</u>.

       <b>%output</b> <u>pane-id</u> <u>value</u>
               A  window  pane  produced  output.  <u>value</u> escapes non-printable characters and backslash as octal
               \xxx.

       <b>%session-changed</b> <u>session-id</u> <u>name</u>
               The client is now attached to the session with ID <u>session-id</u>, which is named <u>name</u>.

       <b>%session-renamed</b> <u>name</u>
               The current session was renamed to <u>name</u>.

       <b>%sessions-changed</b>
               A session was created or destroyed.

       <b>%unlinked-window-add</b> <u>window-id</u>
               The window with ID <u>window-id</u> was created but is not linked to the current session.

       <b>%window-add</b> <u>window-id</u>
               The window with ID <u>window-id</u> was linked to the current session.

       <b>%window-close</b> <u>window-id</u>
               The window with ID <u>window-id</u> closed.

       <b>%window-renamed</b> <u>window-id</u> <u>name</u>
               The window with ID <u>window-id</u> was renamed to <u>name</u>.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:~/.tmux.conf">~/.tmux.conf</a></u>               Default <b>tmate</b> configuration file.
       <u>@SYSCONFDIR@/tmux.conf</u>     System-wide configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To create a new <b>tmate</b> session running <u><a href="../man1/vi.1.html">vi</a></u>(1):

             <b>$</b> <b>tmate</b> <b>new-session</b> <b>vi</b>

       Most commands have a shorter form, known as an alias.  For new-session, this is <b>new</b>:

             <b>$</b> <b>tmate</b> <b>new</b> <b>vi</b>

       Alternatively, the shortest unambiguous form of a command is accepted.  If  there  are  several  options,
       they are listed:

             $ tmate n
             ambiguous command: n, could be: new-session, new-window, next-window

       Within  an  active  session,  a new window may be created by typing ‘C-b c’ (Ctrl followed by the ‘b’ key
       followed by the ‘c’ key).

       Windows may be navigated with: ‘C-b 0’ (to select window 0), ‘C-b 1’ (to select window  1),  and  so  on;
       ‘C-b n’ to select the next window; and ‘C-b p’ to select the previous window.

       A  session  may  be  detached  using  ‘C-b  d’ (or by an external event such as <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) disconnection) and
       reattached with:

             <b>$</b> <b>tmate</b> <b>attach-session</b>

       Typing ‘C-b ?’ lists the current key bindings in the current window; up and down may be used to  navigate
       the list or ‘q’ to exit from it.

       Commands to be run when the <b>tmate</b> server is started may be placed in the <u><a href="file:~/.tmux.conf">~/.tmux.conf</a></u> configuration file.
       Common examples include:

       Changing the default prefix key:

             set-option -g prefix C-a
             unbind-key C-b
             bind-key C-a send-prefix

       Turning the status line off, or changing its colour:

             set-option -g status off
             set-option -g status-style bg=blue

       Setting other options, such as the default command, or locking after 30 minutes of inactivity:

             set-option -g default-command "exec /bin/ksh"
             set-option -g lock-after-time 1800

       Creating new key bindings:

             bind-key b set-option status
             bind-key / command-prompt "split-window 'exec man %%'"
             bind-key S command-prompt "new-window -n %1 'ssh %1'"
