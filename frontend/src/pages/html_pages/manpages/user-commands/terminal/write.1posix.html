</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       write — write to another user

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       write <u>user_name</u> <b>[</b><u>terminal</u><b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>write</u>  utility  shall  read  lines  from  the  standard  input and write them to the terminal of the
       specified user. When first invoked, it shall write the message:

           <b>Message</b> <b>from</b> <u>sender-login-id</u> (<u>sending-terminal</u>) <b>[</b><u>date</u><b>]</b>...

       to <u>user_name</u>.  When it has successfully completed the connection, the sender's terminal shall be  alerted
       twice to indicate that what the sender is typing is being written to the recipient's terminal.

       If the recipient wants to reply, this can be accomplished by typing:

           write <u>sender-login-id</u> <b>[</b><u>sending-terminal</u><b>]</b>

       upon  receipt of the initial message. Whenever a line of input as delimited by an NL, EOF, or EOL special
       character (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Chapter</u> <u>11</u>, <u>General</u>  <u>Terminal</u>  <u>Interface</u>)  is
       accumulated  while  in  canonical  input  mode, the accumulated data shall be written on the other user's
       terminal. Characters shall be processed as follows:

        *  Typing &lt;alert&gt; shall write the &lt;alert&gt; character to the recipient's terminal.

        *  Typing the erase and kill characters shall affect the sender's terminal in the  manner  described  by
           the  <b>termios</b>  interface  in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Chapter</u> <u>11</u>, <u>General</u> <u>Terminal</u>
           <u>Interface</u>.

        *  Typing the interrupt or end-of-file characters shall cause <u>write</u>  to  write  an  appropriate  message
           (<b>"EOT\n"</b> in the POSIX locale) to the recipient's terminal and exit.

        *  Typing  characters  from  <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  classifications <b>print</b> or <b>space</b> shall cause those characters to be
           sent to the recipient's terminal.

        *  When and only when the <u>stty</u> <b>iexten</b> local mode is enabled, the existence and processing of  additional
           special control characters and multi-byte or single-byte functions is implementation-defined.

        *  Typing  other  non-printable  characters  shall  cause  implementation-defined sequences of printable
           characters to be written to the recipient's terminal.

       To write to a user who is logged in more than once, the <u>terminal</u> argument can be used to  indicate  which
       terminal to write to; otherwise, the recipient's terminal is selected in an implementation-defined manner
       and  an  informational  message is written to the sender's standard output, indicating which terminal was
       chosen.

       Permission to be a recipient of a <u>write</u> message can be denied or granted by  use  of  the  <u>mesg</u>  utility.
       However,  a user's privilege may further constrain the domain of accessibility of other users' terminals.
       The <u>write</u> utility shall fail when the user lacks appropriate privileges to perform the requested action.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <u>user_name</u> Login name of the person to whom the message shall be written.  The  application  shall  ensure
                 that this operand is of the form returned by the <u>who</u> utility.

       <u>terminal</u>  Terminal identification in the same format provided by the <u>who</u> utility.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Lines to be copied to the recipient's terminal are read from standard input.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>write</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> for the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files). If
                 the  recipient's  locale  does  not use an <u>LC_CTYPE</u> equivalent to the sender's, the results are
                 undefined.

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to  affect  the  format  and  contents  of  diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error and informative messages written to standard output.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       If  an interrupt signal is received, <u>write</u> shall write an appropriate message on the recipient's terminal
       and exit with a status of zero. It shall take the standard action for all other signals.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       An informational message shall be written to standard output if a recipient is logged in more than once.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The recipient's terminal is used for output.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    The addressed user is not logged on or the addressed user denies permission.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>talk</u> utility is considered by some users to be a more usable utility on full-screen terminals.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>write</u> utility was included in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 since it can be implemented on all terminal
       types. The standard developers considered the <u>talk</u>  utility,  which  cannot  be  implemented  on  certain
       terminals,  to  be a ``better'' communications interface. Both of these programs are in widespread use on
       historical implementations. Therefore, the standard developers decided  that  both  utilities  should  be
       specified.

       The  format of the terminal name is unspecified, but the descriptions of <u>ps</u>, <u>talk</u>, <u>who</u>, and <u>write</u> require
       that they all use or accept the same format.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
