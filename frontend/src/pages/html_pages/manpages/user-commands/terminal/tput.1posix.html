</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tput — change terminal characteristics

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       tput <b>[</b>-T <u>type</u><b>]</b> <u>operand</u>...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>tput</u>  utility  shall display terminal-dependent information. The manner in which this information is
       retrieved is unspecified. The information displayed shall  clear  the  terminal  screen,  initialize  the
       user's  terminal, or reset the user's terminal, depending on the operand given. The exact consequences of
       displaying this information are unspecified.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>tput</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>12.2</u>,  <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The following option shall be supported:

       <b>-T</b> <u>type</u>   Indicate the type of terminal. If this option is not supplied and the <u>TERM</u> variable is unset or
                 null,  an  unspecified  default  terminal  type  shall  be used. The setting of <u>type</u> shall take
                 precedence over the value in <u>TERM</u>.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following strings shall be supported as operands by the implementation in the POSIX locale:

       <b>clear</b>     Display the clear-screen sequence.

       <b>init</b>      Display the sequence that initializes the user's terminal in an implementation-defined manner.

       <b>reset</b>     Display the sequence that resets the user's terminal in an implementation-defined manner.

       If a terminal does not support any of the operations described by  these  operands,  this  shall  not  be
       considered an error condition.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>tput</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> for the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used  to affect the format and contents of diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

       <u>TERM</u>      Determine the terminal type. If this variable is unset or null, and if the  <b>-T</b>  option  is  not
                 specified, an unspecified default terminal type shall be used.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       If standard output is a terminal device, it may be used for writing the appropriate sequence to clear the
       screen  or  reset  or  initialize  the  terminal.  If standard output is not a terminal device, undefined
       results occur.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    The requested string was written successfully.

        1    Unspecified.

        2    Usage error.

        3    No information is available about the specified terminal type.

        4    The specified operand is invalid.

       &gt;4    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       If one of the operands is not available  for  the  terminal,  <u>tput</u>  continues  processing  the  remaining
       operands.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The  difference  between  resetting and initializing a terminal is left unspecified, as they vary greatly
       based on hardware types. In general, resetting is a more severe action.

       Some terminals use control characters to perform the stated functions, and on  such  terminals  it  might
       make  sense  to  use <u>tput</u> to store the initialization strings in a file or environment variable for later
       use. However, because other terminals might rely on system calls to do this  work,  the  standard  output
       cannot be used in a portable manner, such as the following non-portable constructs:

           ClearVar=`tput clear`
           tput reset | mailx -s "Wake Up" ddg

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
        1. Initialize  the  terminal according to the type of terminal in the environmental variable <u>TERM</u>.  This
           command can be included in a <b>.profile</b> file.

               tput init

        2. Reset a 450 terminal.

               tput -T 450 reset

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The list of operands was reduced to a minimum for the following reasons:

        *  The only features chosen were those that were likely to be used by human  users  interacting  with  a
           terminal.

        *  Specifying  the  full  <u>terminfo</u> set was not considered desirable, but the standard developers did not
           want to select among operands.

        *  This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not attempt to  provide  applications  with  sophisticated  terminal
           handling  capabilities,  as  that  falls  outside  of  its  assigned  scope  and  intersects with the
           responsibilities of other standards bodies.

       The difference between resetting and initializing a terminal is left unspecified as this  varies  greatly
       based on hardware types. In general, resetting is a more severe action.

       The  exit  status of 1 is historically reserved for finding out if a Boolean operand is not set. Although
       the operands were reduced to a minimum, the exit status of 1 should still be  reserved  for  the  Boolean
       operands, for those sites that wish to support them.
