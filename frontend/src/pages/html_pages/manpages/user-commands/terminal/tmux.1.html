       tmux — terminal multiplexer

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tmux</b>   [<b>-2CDlNuVv</b>]  [<b>-c</b>  <u>shell-command</u>]  [<b>-f</b>  <u>file</u>]  [<b>-L</b>  <u>socket-name</u>]  [<b>-S</b>  <u>socket-path</u>]  [<b>-T</b>  <u>features</u>]
            [<u>command</u> [<u>flags</u>]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tmux</b> is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals to be created, accessed, and  controlled
       from  a  single  screen.  <b>tmux</b> may be detached from a screen and continue running in the background, then
       later reattached.

       When <b>tmux</b> is started, it creates a new <u>session</u> with a single <u>window</u> and displays it on screen.  A  status
       line  at  the  bottom  of  the  screen  shows  information  on  the  current session and is used to enter
       interactive commands.

       A session is a single collection of <u>pseudo</u> <u>terminals</u> under the management of <b>tmux</b>.  Each session has  one
       or  more  windows  linked  to  it.  A window occupies the entire screen and may be split into rectangular
       panes, each of which is a separate pseudo terminal  (the  <u><a href="../man4/pty.4.html">pty</a></u>(4)  manual  page  documents  the  technical
       details  of  pseudo  terminals).   Any  number of <b>tmux</b> instances may connect to the same session, and any
       number of windows may be present in the same session.  Once all sessions are killed, <b>tmux</b> exits.

       Each session is persistent and will survive accidental disconnection (such as <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1) connection  timeout)
       or intentional detaching (with the ‘C-b d’ key strokes).  <b>tmux</b> may be reattached using:

             <b>$</b> <b>tmux</b> <b>attach</b>

       In  <b>tmux</b>,  a  session is displayed on screen by a <u>client</u> and all sessions are managed by a single <u>server</u>.
       The server and each client are separate processes which communicate through a socket in <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u>.

       The options are as follows:

       <b>-2</b>            Force <b>tmux</b> to assume the terminal supports 256 colours.  This is equivalent to <b>-T</b> <u>256</u>.

       <b>-C</b>            Start in control mode (see the “CONTROL MODE” section).  Given twice (<b>-CC</b>) disables echo.

       <b>-c</b> <u>shell-command</u>
                     Execute <u>shell-command</u> using the default shell.  If  necessary,  the  <b>tmux</b>  server  will  be
                     started  to retrieve the <b>default-shell</b> option.  This option is for compatibility with <u><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></u>(1)
                     when <b>tmux</b> is used as a login shell.

       <b>-D</b>            Do not start the <b>tmux</b> server as a daemon.  This also turns the <b>exit-empty</b> option off.  With
                     <b>-D</b>, <u>command</u> may not be specified.

       <b>-f</b> <u>file</u>       Specify an alternative configuration file.  By default, <b>tmux</b> loads the system configuration
                     file from <u>/etc/tmux.conf</u>,  if  present,  then  looks  for  a  user  configuration  file  at
                     <u><a href="file:~/.tmux.conf">~/.tmux.conf</a></u> or <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tmux/tmux.conf</u>.

                     The  configuration  file  is a set of <b>tmux</b> commands which are executed in sequence when the
                     server is first started.  <b>tmux</b> loads configuration files once when the server  process  has
                     started.  The <b>source-file</b> command may be used to load a file later.

                     <b>tmux</b>  shows  any  error  messages from commands in configuration files in the first session
                     created, and continues to process the rest of the configuration file.

       <b>-L</b> <u>socket-name</u>
                     <b>tmux</b> stores the server socket in a directory under TMUX_TMPDIR or <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u> if it is unset.  The
                     default socket is named <u>default</u>.   This  option  allows  a  different  socket  name  to  be
                     specified,  allowing  several independent <b>tmux</b> servers to be run.  Unlike <b>-S</b> a full path is
                     not necessary: the sockets are all created in a  directory  <u>tmux-UID</u>  under  the  directory
                     given by TMUX_TMPDIR or in <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u>.  The <u>tmux-UID</u> directory is created by <b>tmux</b> and must not be
                     world readable, writable or executable.

                     If  the  socket  is accidentally removed, the SIGUSR1 signal may be sent to the <b>tmux</b> server
                     process to recreate it (note that this will fail if any parent directories are missing).

       <b>-l</b>            Behave as a login shell.  This flag currently has no effect and is for  compatibility  with
                     other shells when using tmux as a login shell.

       <b>-N</b>            Do  not  start the server even if the command would normally do so (for example <b>new-session</b>
                     or <b>start-server</b>).

       <b>-S</b> <u>socket-path</u>
                     Specify a full alternative path to the server socket.  If  <b>-S</b>  is  specified,  the  default
                     socket directory is not used and any <b>-L</b> flag is ignored.

       <b>-T</b> <u>features</u>   Set terminal features for the client.  This is a comma-separated list of features.  See the
                     <b>terminal-features</b> option.

       <b>-u</b>            Write  UTF-8  output  to  the  terminal  even  if the first environment variable of LC_ALL,
                     LC_CTYPE, or LANG that is set does not contain "UTF-8" or "UTF8".

       <b>-V</b>            Report the <b>tmux</b> version.

       <b>-v</b>            Request  verbose  logging.   Log  messages  will  be  saved  into  <u>tmux-client-PID.log</u>  and
                     <u>tmux-server-PID.log</u>  files  in the current directory, where <u>PID</u> is the PID of the server or
                     client process.  If <b>-v</b> is specified twice, an additional <u>tmux-out-PID.log</u> file is generated
                     with a copy of everything <b>tmux</b> writes to the terminal.

                     The SIGUSR2 signal may be sent to the <b>tmux</b> server process to toggle logging between on  (as
                     if <b>-v</b> was given) and off.

       <u>command</u> [<u>flags</u>]
                     This specifies one of a set of commands used to control <b>tmux</b>, as described in the following
                     sections.  If no commands are specified, the <b>new-session</b> command is assumed.

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>KEY</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tmux</b> may be controlled from an attached client by using a key combination of a prefix key, ‘C-b’ (Ctrl-b)
       by default, followed by a command key.

       The default command key bindings are:

             C-b         Send the prefix key (C-b) through to the application.
             C-o         Rotate the panes in the current window forwards.
             C-z         Suspend the <b>tmux</b> client.
             !           Break the current pane out of the window.
             "           Split the current pane into two, top and bottom.
             #           List all paste buffers.
             $           Rename the current session.
             %           Split the current pane into two, left and right.

             '           Prompt for a window index to select.
             (           Switch the attached client to the previous session.
             )           Switch the attached client to the next session.
             ,           Rename the current window.
             -           Delete the most recently copied buffer of text.
             .           Prompt for an index to move the current window.
             0 to 9      Select windows 0 to 9.
             :           Enter the <b>tmux</b> command prompt.
             ;           Move to the previously active pane.
             =           Choose which buffer to paste interactively from a list.
             ?           List all key bindings.
             D           Choose a client to detach.
             L           Switch the attached client back to the last session.
             [           Enter copy mode to copy text or view the history.
             ]           Paste the most recently copied buffer of text.
             c           Create a new window.
             d           Detach the current client.
             f           Prompt to search for text in open windows.
             i           Display some information about the current window.
             l           Move to the previously selected window.
             m           Mark the current pane (see <b>select-pane</b> <b>-m</b>).
             M           Clear the marked pane.
             n           Change to the next window.
             o           Select the next pane in the current window.
             p           Change to the previous window.
             q           Briefly display pane indexes.
             r           Force redraw of the attached client.
             s           Select a new session for the attached client interactively.
             t           Show the time.
             w           Choose the current window interactively.
             x           Kill the current pane.
             z           Toggle zoom state of the current pane.
             {           Swap the current pane with the previous pane.
             }           Swap the current pane with the next pane.
             ~           Show previous messages from <b>tmux</b>, if any.
             Page Up     Enter copy mode and scroll one page up.
             Up, Down
             Left, Right

             M-1 to M-5  Arrange panes in one of the seven preset layouts: even-horizontal, even-vertical, main-
                         horizontal, main-horizontal-mirrored, main-vertical, main-vertical, or tiled.
             Space       Arrange the current window in the next preset layout.
             M-n         Move to the next window with a bell or activity marker.
             M-o         Rotate the panes in the current window backwards.
             M-p         Move to the previous window with a bell or activity marker.
             C-Up, C-Down
             C-Left, C-Right
                         Resize the current pane in steps of one cell.
             M-Up, M-Down
             M-Left, M-Right
                         Resize the current pane in steps of five cells.

       Key bindings may be changed with the <b>bind-key</b> and <b>unbind-key</b> commands.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>PARSING</b> <b>AND</b> <b>EXECUTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tmux</b>  supports  a  large  number of commands which can be used to control its behaviour.  Each command is
       named and can accept zero or more flags and arguments.  They may be bound to  a  key  with  the  <b>bind-key</b>
       command  or  run  from the shell prompt, a shell script, a configuration file or the command prompt.  For
       example, the same <b>set-option</b> command run from the shell prompt, from <u><a href="file:~/.tmux.conf">~/.tmux.conf</a></u> and bound to a key  may
       look like:

             $ tmux set-option -g status-style bg=cyan

             set-option -g status-style bg=cyan

             bind-key C set-option -g status-style bg=cyan

       Here, the command name is ‘set-option’, ‘<b>-g</b>’ is a flag and ‘status-style’ and ‘bg=cyan’ are arguments.

       <b>tmux</b>  distinguishes  between command parsing and execution.  In order to execute a command, <b>tmux</b> needs it
       to be split up into its name and arguments.  This is command parsing.  If  a  command  is  run  from  the
       shell,  the  shell parses it; from inside <b>tmux</b> or from a configuration file, <b>tmux</b> does.  Examples of when
       <b>tmux</b> parses commands are:

             <b>-</b>   in a configuration file;

             <b>-</b>   typed at the command prompt (see <b>command-prompt</b>);

             <b>-</b>   given to <b>bind-key</b>;

             <b>-</b>   passed as arguments to <b>if-shell</b> or <b>confirm-before</b>.

       To execute commands, each client has a ‘command queue’.  A global  command  queue  not  attached  to  any
       client  is used on startup for configuration files like <u><a href="file:~/.tmux.conf">~/.tmux.conf</a></u>.  Parsed commands added to the queue
       are executed in order.  Some commands, like <b>if-shell</b> and <b>confirm-before</b>, parse their argument to create a
       new command which is inserted immediately after themselves.  This means  that  arguments  can  be  parsed
       twice  or  more  - once when the parent command (such as <b>if-shell</b>) is parsed and again when it parses and
       executes its command.  Commands like <b>if-shell</b>, <b>run-shell</b> and <b>display-panes</b> stop execution  of  subsequent
       commands on the queue until something happens - <b>if-shell</b> and <b>run-shell</b> until a shell command finishes and
       <b>display-panes</b> until a key is pressed.  For example, the following commands:

             new-session; new-window
             if-shell "true" "split-window"
             kill-session

       Will  execute <b>new-session</b>, <b>new-window</b>, <b>if-shell</b>, the shell command <u><a href="../man1/true.1.html">true</a></u>(1), <b>split-window</b> and <b>kill-session</b>
       in that order.

       The “COMMANDS” section lists the <b>tmux</b> commands and their arguments.

</pre><h4><b>PARSING</b> <b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       This section describes the syntax of commands parsed by <b>tmux</b>, for example in a configuration file  or  at
       the  command  prompt.  Note that when commands are entered into the shell, they are parsed by the shell -
       see for example <u><a href="../man1/ksh.1.html">ksh</a></u>(1) or <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1).

       Each command is terminated by a newline or a semicolon (;).  Commands separated  by  semicolons  together
       form  a ‘command sequence’ - if a command in the sequence encounters an error, no subsequent commands are
       executed.

       It is recommended that a semicolon used as a command separator should be written as an individual  token,
       for example from <u><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></u>(1):

             $ tmux neww \; splitw

       Or:

             $ tmux neww ';' splitw

       Or from the tmux command prompt:

             neww ; splitw

       However,  a  trailing  semicolon  is  also interpreted as a command separator, for example in these <u><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></u>(1)
       commands:

             $ tmux neww\; splitw

       Or:

             $ tmux 'neww;' splitw

       As in these examples, when running tmux from the shell  extra  care  must  be  taken  to  properly  quote
       semicolons:

             1.   Semicolons  that  should  be interpreted as a command separator should be escaped according to
                  the shell conventions.  For <u><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></u>(1) this typically means quoted (such as ‘neww ';'  splitw’)  or
                  escaped (such as ‘neww \\\\; splitw’).

             2.   Individual semicolons or trailing semicolons that should be interpreted as arguments should be
                  escaped  twice:  once  according  to  the  shell  conventions  and a second time for <b>tmux</b>; for
                  example:

                        $ tmux neww 'foo\\;' bar
                        $ tmux neww foo\\\\; bar

             3.   Semicolons that are not individual tokens or trailing another token  should  only  be  escaped
                  once according to shell conventions; for example:

                        $ tmux neww 'foo-;-bar'
                        $ tmux neww foo-\\;-bar

       Comments are marked by the unquoted # character - any remaining text after a comment is ignored until the
       end of the line.

       If  the  last character of a line is \, the line is joined with the following line (the \ and the newline
       are completely removed).  This is called line continuation and applies both  inside  and  outside  quoted
       strings and in comments, but not inside braces.

       Command  arguments  may  be  specified  as  strings surrounded by single (') quotes, double quotes (") or
       braces ({}).  This is required when the argument contains  any  special  character.   Single  and  double
       quoted strings cannot span multiple lines except with line continuation.  Braces can span multiple lines.

       Outside of quotes and inside double quotes, these replacements are performed:

             <b>-</b>   Environment  variables  preceded by $ are replaced with their value from the global environment
                 (see the “GLOBAL AND SESSION ENVIRONMENT” section).

             <b>-</b>   A leading ~ or ~user is expanded to the home directory of the current or specified user.

             <b>-</b>   \uXXXX or \uXXXXXXXX is replaced by the Unicode codepoint corresponding to the  given  four  or
                 eight digit hexadecimal number.

             <b>-</b>   When  preceded  (escaped)  by  a  \,  the  following  characters are replaced: \e by the escape
                 character; \r by a carriage return; \n by a newline; and \t by a tab.

             <b>-</b>   \ooo is replaced by a character of the octal value ooo.  Three octal digits are  required,  for
                 example \001.  The largest valid character is \377.

             <b>-</b>   Any  other  characters preceded by \ are replaced by themselves (that is, the \ is removed) and
                 are not treated as having any special meaning - so for example  \;  will  not  mark  a  command
                 sequence and \$ will not expand an environment variable.

       Braces  are parsed as a configuration file (so conditions such as ‘%if’ are processed) and then converted
       into a string.  They are designed to avoid the need for additional escaping when passing a group of  <b>tmux</b>
       commands  as  an  argument  (for example to <b>if-shell</b>).  These two examples produce an identical command -
       note that no escaping is needed when using {}:

             if-shell true {
                 display -p 'brace-dollar-foo: }$foo'
             }

             if-shell true "display -p 'brace-dollar-foo: }\$foo'"

       Braces may be enclosed inside braces, for example:

             bind x if-shell "true" {
                 if-shell "true" {
                     display "true!"
                 }
             }

       Environment variables may be set  by  using  the  syntax  ‘name=value’,  for  example  ‘HOME=/home/user’.
       Variables  set  during  parsing  are  added to the global environment.  A hidden variable may be set with
       ‘%hidden’, for example:

             %hidden MYVAR=42

       Hidden variables are not passed to the environment of processes created by tmux.   See  the  “GLOBAL  AND
       SESSION ENVIRONMENT” section.

       Commands  may be parsed conditionally by surrounding them with ‘%if’, ‘%elif’, ‘%else’ and ‘%endif’.  The
       argument to ‘%if’ and ‘%elif’ is expanded as a format (see “FORMATS”) and if it evaluates to false  (zero
       or empty), subsequent text is ignored until the closing ‘%elif’, ‘%else’ or ‘%endif’.  For example:

             %if "#{==:#{host},myhost}"
             set -g status-style bg=red
             %elif "#{==:#{host},myotherhost}"
             set -g status-style bg=green
             %else
             set -g status-style bg=blue
             %endif

       Will  change the status line to red if running on ‘myhost’, green if running on ‘myotherhost’, or blue if
       running on another host.  Conditionals may be given on one line, for example:

             %if #{==:#{host},myhost} set -g status-style bg=red %endif

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       This section describes the commands supported by  <b>tmux</b>.   Most  commands  accept  the  optional  <b>-t</b>  (and
       sometimes  <b>-s</b>)  argument with one of <u>target-client</u>, <u>target-session</u>, <u>target-window</u>, or <u>target-pane</u>.  These
       specify the client, session, window or pane which a command should affect.

       <u>target-client</u> should be the name of the client,  typically  the  <u><a href="../man4/pty.4.html">pty</a></u>(4)  file  to  which  the  client  is
       connected, for example either of <u>/dev/ttyp1</u> or <u>ttyp1</u> for the client attached to <u>/dev/ttyp1</u>.  If no client
       is specified, <b>tmux</b> attempts to work out the client currently in use; if that fails, an error is reported.
       Clients may be listed with the <b>list-clients</b> command.

       <u>target-session</u> is tried as, in order:

             1.   A session ID prefixed with a $.

             2.   An exact name of a session (as listed by the <b>list-sessions</b> command).

             3.   The start of a session name, for example ‘mysess’ would match a session named ‘mysession’.

             4.   An <u><a href="../man3/fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch</a></u>(3) pattern which is matched against the session name.

       If  the  session  name  is  prefixed with an ‘=’, only an exact match is accepted (so ‘=mysess’ will only
       match exactly ‘mysess’, not ‘mysession’).

       If a single session is found, it is used as the target session; multiple matches produce an error.  If  a
       session  is  omitted,  the  current session is used if available; if no current session is available, the
       most recently used is chosen.

       <u>target-window</u> (or <u>src-window</u> or <u>dst-window</u>) specifies a  window  in  the  form  <u>session</u>:<u>window</u>.   <u>session</u>
       follows the same rules as for <u>target-session</u>, and <u>window</u> is looked for in order as:

             1.   A special token, listed below.

             2.   A window index, for example ‘mysession:1’ is window 1 in session ‘mysession’.

             3.   A window ID, such as @1.

             4.   An exact window name, such as ‘mysession:mywindow’.

             5.   The start of a window name, such as ‘mysession:mywin’.

             6.   As an <u><a href="../man3/fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch</a></u>(3) pattern matched against the window name.

       Like  sessions, a ‘=’ prefix will do an exact match only.  An empty window name specifies the next unused
       index if appropriate (for example the <b>new-window</b> and <b>link-window</b> commands) otherwise the  current  window
       in <u>session</u> is chosen.

       The  following  special tokens are available to indicate particular windows.  Each has a single-character
       alternative form.

       <b>Token</b>              <b>Meaning</b>
       <b>{start}</b>       ^    The lowest-numbered window
       <b>{end}</b>         $    The highest-numbered window
       <b>{last}</b>        !    The last (previously current) window
       <b>{next}</b>        +    The next window by number
       <b>{previous}</b>    -    The previous window by number

       <u>target-pane</u> (or <u>src-pane</u> or <u>dst-pane</u>) may be a pane ID or takes a similar form to <u>target-window</u> but  with
       the   optional   addition   of   a   period   followed   by  a  pane  index  or  pane  ID,  for  example:
       ‘mysession:mywindow.1’.  If the pane index is omitted, the currently active pane in the specified  window
       is used.  The following special tokens are available for the pane index:

       <b>Token</b>                  <b>Meaning</b>
       <b>{last}</b>            !    The last (previously active) pane
       <b>{next}</b>            +    The next pane by number
       <b>{previous}</b>        -    The previous pane by number
       <b>{top}</b>                  The top pane
       <b>{bottom}</b>               The bottom pane
       <b>{left}</b>                 The leftmost pane
       <b>{right}</b>                The rightmost pane
       <b>{top-left}</b>             The top-left pane
       <b>{top-right}</b>            The top-right pane
       <b>{bottom-left}</b>          The bottom-left pane
       <b>{bottom-right}</b>         The bottom-right pane
       <b>{up-of}</b>                The pane above the active pane
       <b>{down-of}</b>              The pane below the active pane
       <b>{left-of}</b>              The pane to the left of the active pane
       <b>{right-of}</b>             The pane to the right of the active pane

       The tokens ‘+’ and ‘-’ may be followed by an offset, for example:

             select-window -t:+2

       In  addition,  <u>target-session</u>,  <u>target-window</u>  or <u>target-pane</u> may consist entirely of the token ‘{mouse}’
       (alternative form ‘=’) to specify the session, window or pane where the most recent mouse event  occurred
       (see  the  “MOUSE  SUPPORT” section) or ‘{marked}’ (alternative form ‘~’) to specify the marked pane (see
       <b>select-pane</b> <b>-m</b>).

       Sessions, window and panes are each numbered with a unique ID; session  IDs  are  prefixed  with  a  ‘$’,
       windows  with  a  ‘@’,  and  panes  with  a  ‘%’.  These are unique and are unchanged for the life of the
       session, window or pane in the <b>tmux</b> server.  The pane ID is passed to the child process of  the  pane  in
       the  TMUX_PANE  environment  variable.   IDs  may  be  displayed  using the ‘session_id’, ‘window_id’, or
       ‘pane_id’ formats (see the “FORMATS” section) and the  <b>display-message</b>,  <b>list-sessions</b>,  <b>list-windows</b>  or
       <b>list-panes</b> commands.

       <u>shell-command</u>  arguments  are  <u><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></u>(1)  commands.   This  may be a single argument passed to the shell, for
       example:

             new-window 'vi <a href="file:~/.tmux.conf">~/.tmux.conf</a>'

       Will run:

             <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a> -c 'vi <a href="file:~/.tmux.conf">~/.tmux.conf</a>'

       Additionally, the <b>new-window</b>, <b>new-session</b>, <b>split-window</b>, <b>respawn-window</b> and <b>respawn-pane</b>  commands  allow
       <u>shell-command</u>  to be given as multiple arguments and executed directly (without ‘sh -c’).  This can avoid
       issues with shell quoting.  For example:

             $ tmux new-window vi <a href="file:~/.tmux.conf">~/.tmux.conf</a>

       Will run <u><a href="../man1/vi.1.html">vi</a></u>(1) directly without invoking the shell.

       <u>command</u> [<u>argument</u> <u>...</u>] refers to a <b>tmux</b> command, either passed with the command and arguments separately,
       for example:

             bind-key F1 set-option status off

       Or passed as a single string argument in <u>.tmux.conf</u>, for example:

             bind-key F1 { set-option status off }

       Example <b>tmux</b> commands include:

             refresh-client -t/dev/ttyp2

             rename-session -tfirst newname

             set-option -wt:0 monitor-activity on

             new-window ; split-window -d

             bind-key R source-file <a href="file:~/.tmux.conf">~/.tmux.conf</a> \; \
                     display-message "source-file done"

       Or from <u><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></u>(1):

             $ tmux kill-window -t :1

             $ tmux new-window \; split-window -d

             $ tmux new-session -d 'vi <a href="file:~/.tmux.conf">~/.tmux.conf</a>' \; split-window -d \; attach

</pre><h4><b>CLIENTS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SESSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>tmux</b> server manages clients, sessions, windows and  panes.   Clients  are  attached  to  sessions  to
       interact  with  them,  either  when  they  are  created  with  the <b>new-session</b> command, or later with the
       <b>attach-session</b> command.  Each session has one or more windows <u>linked</u> into it.  Windows may be  linked  to
       multiple  sessions  and  are  made  up  of  one  or more panes, each of which contains a pseudo terminal.
       Commands for creating, linking and otherwise manipulating windows are covered in the “WINDOWS AND  PANES”
       section.

       The following commands are available to manage clients and sessions:

       <b>attach-session</b> [<b>-dErx</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>working-directory</u>] [<b>-f</b> <u>flags</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-session</u>]
                     (alias: <b>attach</b>)
               If  run from outside <b>tmux</b>, attach to <u>target-session</u> in the current terminal.  <u>target-session</u> must
               already exist - to create a new session, see the  <b>new-session</b>  command  (with  <b>-A</b>  to  create  or
               attach).  If used from inside, switch the currently attached session to <u>target-session</u>.  If <b>-d</b> is
               specified,  any  other clients attached to the session are detached.  If <b>-x</b> is given, send SIGHUP
               to the parent process of the client as well as detaching the  client,  typically  causing  it  to
               exit.  <b>-f</b> sets a comma-separated list of client flags.  The flags are:

               active-pane
                       the client has an independent active pane

               ignore-size
                       the client does not affect the size of other clients

               no-output
                       the client does not receive pane output in control mode

               pause-after=seconds
                       output is paused once the pane is <u>seconds</u> behind in control mode

               read-only
                       the client is read-only

               wait-exit
                       wait for an empty line input before exiting in control mode

               A  leading  ‘!’  turns  a  flag  off  if  the  client is already attached.  <b>-r</b> is an alias for <b>-f</b>
               <u>read-only,ignore-size</u>.  When a client is read-only, only  keys  bound  to  the  <b>detach-client</b>  or
               <b>switch-client</b>  commands  have  any  effect.  A client with the <u>active-pane</u> flag allows the active
               pane to be selected independently of the window's active pane used by clients without  the  flag.
               This only affects the cursor position and commands issued from the client; other features such as
               hooks and styles continue to use the window's active pane.

               If  no server is started, <b>attach-session</b> will attempt to start it; this will fail unless sessions
               are created in the configuration file.

               The <u>target-session</u> rules for <b>attach-session</b> are slightly adjusted: if <b>tmux</b> needs  to  select  the
               most recently used session, it will prefer the most recently used <u>unattached</u> session.

               <b>-c</b> will set the session working directory (used for new windows) to <u>working-directory</u>.

               If <b>-E</b> is used, the <b>update-environment</b> option will not be applied.

       <b>detach-client</b> [<b>-aP</b>] [<b>-E</b> <u>shell-command</u>] [<b>-s</b> <u>target-session</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-client</u>]
                     (alias: <b>detach</b>)
               Detach  the  current  client  if  bound  to  a  key, the client specified with <b>-t</b>, or all clients
               currently attached to the session specified by <b>-s</b>.  The <b>-a</b> option kills all but the client  given
               with  <b>-t</b>.   If <b>-P</b> is given, send SIGHUP to the parent process of the client, typically causing it
               to exit.  With <b>-E</b>, run <u>shell-command</u> to replace the client.

       <b>has-session</b> [<b>-t</b> <u>target-session</u>]
                     (alias: <b>has</b>)
               Report an error and exit with 1 if the specified session does not exist.  If it does exist,  exit
               with 0.

       <b>kill-server</b>
               Kill the <b>tmux</b> server and clients and destroy all sessions.

       <b>kill-session</b> [<b>-aC</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-session</u>]
               Destroy  the given session, closing any windows linked to it and no other sessions, and detaching
               all clients attached to it.  If <b>-a</b> is given, all sessions but the specified one is  killed.   The
               <b>-C</b> flag clears alerts (bell, activity, or silence) in all windows linked to the session.

       <b>list-clients</b> [<b>-F</b> <u>format</u>] [<b>-f</b> <u>filter</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-session</u>]
                     (alias: <b>lsc</b>)
               List  all  clients attached to the server.  <b>-F</b> specifies the format of each line and <b>-f</b> a filter.
               Only clients  for  which  the  filter  is  true  are  shown.   See  the  “FORMATS”  section.   If
               <u>target-session</u> is specified, list only clients connected to that session.

       <b>list-commands</b> [<b>-F</b> <u>format</u>] [<u>command</u>]
                     (alias: <b>lscm</b>)
               List the syntax of <u>command</u> or - if omitted - of all commands supported by <b>tmux</b>.

       <b>list-sessions</b> [<b>-F</b> <u>format</u>] [<b>-f</b> <u>filter</u>]
                     (alias: <b>ls</b>)
               List  all  sessions managed by the server.  <b>-F</b> specifies the format of each line and <b>-f</b> a filter.
               Only sessions for which the filter is true are shown.  See the “FORMATS” section.

       <b>lock-client</b> [<b>-t</b> <u>target-client</u>]
                     (alias: <b>lockc</b>)
               Lock <u>target-client</u>, see the <b>lock-server</b> command.

       <b>lock-session</b> [<b>-t</b> <u>target-session</u>]
                     (alias: <b>locks</b>)
               Lock all clients attached to <u>target-session</u>.

       <b>new-session</b> [<b>-AdDEPX</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>start-directory</u>] [<b>-e</b> <u>environment</u>] [<b>-f</b> <u>flags</u>] [<b>-F</b> <u>format</u>] [<b>-n</b>  <u>window-name</u>]  [<b>-s</b>
               <u>session-name</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>group-name</u>] [<b>-x</b> <u>width</u>] [<b>-y</b> <u>height</u>] [<u>shell-command</u>]
                     (alias: <b>new</b>)
               Create a new session with name <u>session-name</u>.

               The  new  session  is  attached  to  the  current  terminal  unless <b>-d</b> is given.  <u>window-name</u> and
               <u>shell-command</u> are the name of and shell command to execute in the initial window.  With  <b>-d</b>,  the
               initial  size  comes  from  the  global  <b>default-size</b>  option; <b>-x</b> and <b>-y</b> can be used to specify a
               different size.  ‘-’ uses the size of the current client if any.  If  <b>-x</b>  or  <b>-y</b>  is  given,  the
               <b>default-size</b>  option is set for the session.  <b>-f</b> sets a comma-separated list of client flags (see
               <b>attach-session</b>).

               If run from a terminal, any <u><a href="../man4/termios.4.html">termios</a></u>(4) special characters are saved and used for new  windows  in
               the new session.

               The <b>-A</b> flag makes <b>new-session</b> behave like <b>attach-session</b> if <u>session-name</u> already exists; if <b>-A</b> is
               given, <b>-D</b> behaves like <b>-d</b> to <b>attach-session</b>, and <b>-X</b> behaves like <b>-x</b> to <b>attach-session</b>.

               If  <b>-t</b>  is given, it specifies a <b>session</b> <b>group</b>.  Sessions in the same group share the same set of
               windows - new windows are linked to all sessions in the group and any windows closed removed from
               all sessions.  The current and previous window and any session options remain independent and any
               session in a group may be killed without affecting the others.  The <u>group-name</u> argument may be:

               1.      the name of an existing group, in which case the new session is added to that group;

               2.      the name of an existing session - the new session is added to  the  same  group  as  that
                       session, creating a new group if necessary;

               3.      the name for a new group containing only the new session.

               <b>-n</b> and <u>shell-command</u> are invalid if <b>-t</b> is used.

               The <b>-P</b> option prints information about the new session after it has been created.  By default, it
               uses the format ‘#{session_name}:’ but a different format may be specified with <b>-F</b>.

               If  <b>-E</b>  is  used,  the  <b>update-environment</b>  option  will  not  be  applied.   <b>-e</b>  takes  the form
               ‘VARIABLE=value’ and sets an environment variable for  the  newly  created  session;  it  may  be
               specified multiple times.

       <b>refresh-client</b>  [<b>-cDLRSU</b>]  [<b>-A</b>  <u>pane:state</u>] [<b>-B</b> <u>name:what:format</u>] [<b>-C</b> <u>size</u>] [<b>-f</b> <u>flags</u>] [<b>-l</b> [<u>target-pane</u>]]
               [<b>-r</b> <u>pane:report</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-client</u>] [<u>adjustment</u>]
                     (alias: <b>refresh</b>)
               Refresh the current client if bound to a key, or a single client if one is given with <b>-t</b>.  If  <b>-S</b>
               is specified, only update the client's status line.

               The  <b>-U</b>,  <b>-D</b>,  <b>-L</b> <b>-R</b>, and <b>-c</b> flags allow the visible portion of a window which is larger than the
               client to be changed.  <b>-U</b> moves the visible part up by <u>adjustment</u> rows and <b>-D</b> down,  <b>-L</b>  left  by
               <u>adjustment</u> columns and <b>-R</b> right.  <b>-c</b> returns to tracking the cursor automatically.  If <u>adjustment</u>
               is  omitted,  1  is  used.  Note that the visible position is a property of the client not of the
               window, changing the current window in the attached session will reset it.

               <b>-C</b> sets the width and height of a control mode client or of a window for a control  mode  client,
               <u>size</u>  must  be  one  of  ‘widthxheight’  or  ‘window  ID:widthxheight’,  for  example  ‘80x24’ or
               ‘@0:80x24’.  <b>-A</b> allows a control mode client to trigger actions on a pane.   The  argument  is  a
               pane  ID  (with leading ‘%’), a colon, then one of ‘on’, ‘off’, ‘continue’ or ‘pause’.  If ‘off’,
               <b>tmux</b> will not send output from the pane to the client and if all clients  have  turned  the  pane
               off,  will  stop reading from the pane.  If ‘continue’, <b>tmux</b> will return to sending output to the
               pane if it was paused (manually or with the <u>pause-after</u> flag).  If ‘pause’, <b>tmux</b> will  pause  the
               pane.  <b>-A</b> may be given multiple times for different panes.

               <b>-B</b>  sets  a subscription to a format for a control mode client.  The argument is split into three
               items by colons: <u>name</u> is a name for the subscription; <u>what</u> is a type of  item  to  subscribe  to;
               <u>format</u> is the format.  After a subscription is added, changes to the format are reported with the
               <b>%subscription-changed</b>  notification,  at  most  once  a  second.   If only the name is given, the
               subscription is removed.  <u>what</u> may be empty to check the format only for the attached session, or
               one of: a pane ID such as ‘%0’; ‘%*’ for all panes in the attached session; a window ID  such  as
               ‘@0’; or ‘@*’ for all windows in the attached session.

               <b>-f</b>  sets  a  comma-separated  list of client flags, see <b>attach-session</b>.  <b>-r</b> allows a control mode
               client to provide information about a pane via a report (such as the response to  OSC  10).   The
               argument is a pane ID (with a leading ‘%’), a colon, then a report escape sequence.

               <b>-l</b>  requests the clipboard from the client using the <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1) escape sequence.  If <u>target-pane</u> is
               given, the clipboard is sent (in encoded form), otherwise it is stored in a new paste buffer.

               <b>-L</b>, <b>-R</b>, <b>-U</b> and <b>-D</b> move the visible portion of the window left, right, up or down  by  <u>adjustment</u>,
               if the window is larger than the client.  <b>-c</b> resets so that the position follows the cursor.  See
               the <b>window-size</b> option.

       <b>rename-session</b> [<b>-t</b> <u>target-session</u>] <u>new-name</u>
                     (alias: <b>rename</b>)
               Rename the session to <u>new-name</u>.

       <b>server-access</b> [<b>-adlrw</b>] [<u>user</u>]
               Change the access or read/write permission of <u>user</u>.  The user running the <b>tmux</b> server (its owner)
               and the root user cannot be changed and are always permitted access.

               <b>-a</b>  and  <b>-d</b>  are  used  to  give or revoke access for the specified user.  If the user is already
               attached, the <b>-d</b> flag causes their clients to be detached.

               <b>-r</b> and <b>-w</b> change the permissions for <u>user</u>: <b>-r</b> makes their clients read-only and <b>-w</b> writable.   <b>-l</b>
               lists current access permissions.

               By  default,  the  access  list  is  empty  and <b>tmux</b> creates sockets with file system permissions
               preventing access by any user other than the owner (and root).  These permissions must be changed
               manually.  Great care should be taken not to allow access to untrusted users even read-only.

       <b>show-messages</b> [<b>-JT</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-client</u>]
                     (alias: <b>showmsgs</b>)
               Show server messages or information.  Messages are stored, up to a maximum of the  limit  set  by
               the <u>message-limit</u> server option.  <b>-J</b> and <b>-T</b> show debugging information about jobs and terminals.

       <b>source-file</b> [<b>-Fnqv</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>] <u>path</u> <u>...</u>
                     (alias: <b>source</b>)
               Execute commands from one or more files specified by <u>path</u> (which may be <u><a href="../man7/glob.7.html">glob</a></u>(7) patterns).  If <b>-F</b>
               is present, then <u>path</u> is expanded as a format.  If <b>-q</b> is given, no error will be returned if <u>path</u>
               does  not  exist.  With <b>-n</b>, the file is parsed but no commands are executed.  <b>-v</b> shows the parsed
               commands and line numbers if possible.

       <b>start-server</b>
                     (alias: <b>start</b>)
               Start the <b>tmux</b> server, if not already running, without creating any sessions.

               Note that as by default the <b>tmux</b> server will exit with no sessions, this  is  only  useful  if  a
               session  is  created in <u><a href="file:~/.tmux.conf">~/.tmux.conf</a></u>, <b>exit-empty</b> is turned off, or another command is run as part
               of the same command sequence.  For example:

                     $ tmux start \; show -g

       <b>suspend-client</b> [<b>-t</b> <u>target-client</u>]
                     (alias: <b>suspendc</b>)
               Suspend a client by sending SIGTSTP (tty stop).

       <b>switch-client</b> [<b>-ElnprZ</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>target-client</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-session</u>] [<b>-T</b> <u>key-table</u>]
                     (alias: <b>switchc</b>)
               Switch the current session for client <u>target-client</u> to <u>target-session</u>.  As a special case, <b>-t</b> may
               refer to a pane (a target that contains ‘:’, ‘.’ or ‘%’), to change session, window and pane.  In
               that case, <b>-Z</b> keeps the window zoomed if it was zoomed.  If <b>-l</b>, <b>-n</b> or <b>-p</b> is used, the  client  is
               moved  to  the  last, next or previous session respectively.  <b>-r</b> toggles the client <b>read-only</b> and
               <b>ignore-size</b> flags (see the <b>attach-session</b> command).

               If <b>-E</b> is used, <b>update-environment</b> option will not be applied.

               <b>-T</b> sets the client's key table; the next key from the client will be interpreted from  <u>key-table</u>.
               This  may  be  used  to configure multiple prefix keys, or to bind commands to sequences of keys.
               For example, to make typing ‘abc’ run the <b>list-keys</b> command:

                     bind-key -Ttable2 c list-keys
                     bind-key -Ttable1 b switch-client -Ttable2
                     bind-key -Troot   a switch-client -Ttable1

</pre><h4><b>WINDOWS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>PANES</b></h4><pre>
       Each window displayed by <b>tmux</b> may be split into one or more <u>panes</u>; each pane takes up a certain  area  of
       the display and is a separate terminal.  A window may be split into panes using the <b>split-window</b> command.
       Windows  may  be  split  horizontally  (with  the  <b>-h</b> flag) or vertically.  Panes may be resized with the
       <b>resize-pane</b> command (bound to ‘C-Up’, ‘C-Down’ ‘C-Left’ and ‘C-Right’ by default), the current  pane  may
       be  changed with the <b>select-pane</b> command and the <b>rotate-window</b> and <b>swap-pane</b> commands may be used to swap
       panes without changing their position.  Panes are numbered beginning from zero  in  the  order  they  are
       created.

       By  default, a <b>tmux</b> pane permits direct access to the terminal contained in the pane.  A pane may also be
       put into one of several modes:

             <b>-</b>   Copy mode, which permits a section of a window or its history to be copied to  a  <u>paste</u>  <u>buffer</u>
                 for  later  insertion  into  another  window.  This mode is entered with the <b>copy-mode</b> command,
                 bound to ‘[’ by default.  Copied text can be pasted with the  <b>paste-buffer</b>  command,  bound  to
                 ‘]’.

             <b>-</b>   View  mode, which is like copy mode but is entered when a command that produces output, such as
                 <b>list-keys</b>, is executed from a key binding.

             <b>-</b>   Choose mode, which allows an item to be chosen from a list.  This may be a client, a session or
                 window or pane, or a buffer.  This mode is entered with the  <b>choose-buffer</b>,  <b>choose-client</b>  and
                 <b>choose-tree</b> commands.

       In  copy mode an indicator is displayed in the top-right corner of the pane with the current position and
       the number of lines in the history.

       Commands are sent to copy mode using the <b>-X</b> flag to the <b>send-keys</b> command.  When a key is  pressed,  copy
       mode automatically uses one of two key tables, depending on the <b>mode-keys</b> option: <b>copy-mode</b> for emacs, or
       <b>copy-mode-vi</b> for vi.  Key tables may be viewed with the <b>list-keys</b> command.

       The following commands are supported in copy mode:

       <b>append-selection</b>
               Append the selection to the top paste buffer.

       <b>append-selection-and-cancel</b> (vi: A)

       The search commands come in several  varieties:  ‘search-forward’  and  ‘search-backward’  search  for  a
       regular expression; the ‘-text’ variants search for a plain text string rather than a regular expression;
       ‘-incremental’ perform an incremental search and expect to be used with the <b>-i</b> flag to the <b>command-prompt</b>
       command.   ‘search-again’  repeats  the  last  search and ‘search-reverse’ does the same but reverses the
       direction (forward becomes backward and backward becomes forward).

       The ‘next-prompt’ and ‘previous-prompt’ move between shell prompts, but require  the  shell  to  emit  an
       escape  sequence  (\033]133;A\033\\) to tell <b>tmux</b> where the prompts are located; if the shell does not do
       this, these commands will do nothing.  The <b>-o</b> flag jumps to the beginning of the command  output  instead
       of the shell prompt.

       Copy  commands may take an optional buffer prefix argument which is used to generate the buffer name (the
       default is ‘buffer’ so buffers are named ‘buffer0’, ‘buffer1’ and so on).  Pipe commands take  a  command
       argument  which  is  the command to which the selected text is piped.  ‘copy-pipe’ variants also copy the
       selection.  The ‘-and-cancel’ variants of some commands exit copy mode after  they  have  completed  (for
       copy  commands)  or when the cursor reaches the bottom (for scrolling commands).  ‘-no-clear’ variants do
       not clear the selection.

       The next and previous word keys skip over whitespace and treat consecutive runs of either word separators
       or other letters as words.  Word separators can be customized with the  <u>word-separators</u>  session  option.
       Next  word  moves  to  the start of the next word, next word end to the end of the next word and previous
       word to the start of the previous word.  The three next and previous space keys work similarly but use  a
       space  alone as the word separator.  Setting <u>word-separators</u> to the empty string makes next/previous word
       equivalent to next/previous space.

       The jump commands enable quick movement within a line.  For instance, typing ‘f’  followed  by  ‘/’  will
       move  the  cursor  to  the  next  ‘/’  character  on  the current line.  A ‘;’ will then jump to the next
       occurrence.

       Commands in copy mode may be prefaced by an optional repeat count.  With vi key  bindings,  a  prefix  is
       entered using the number keys; with emacs, the Alt (meta) key and a number begins prefix entry.

       The synopsis for the <b>copy-mode</b> command is:

       <b>copy-mode</b> [<b>-deHMqu</b>] [<b>-s</b> <u>src-pane</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>]
               Enter  copy  mode.  <b>-u</b> also scrolls one page up after entering and <b>-d</b> one page down if already in
               copy mode.  <b>-M</b> begins a mouse drag (only valid if bound  to  a  mouse  key  binding,  see  “MOUSE
               SUPPORT”).  <b>-H</b> hides the position indicator in the top right.  <b>-q</b> cancels copy mode and any other
               modes.  <b>-s</b> copies from <u>src-pane</u> instead of <u>target-pane</u>.

               <b>-e</b> specifies that scrolling to the bottom of the history (to the visible screen) should exit copy
               mode.   While  in copy mode, pressing a key other than those used for scrolling will disable this
               behaviour.  This is intended to allow fast scrolling through a pane's history, for example with:

                     bind PageUp copy-mode -eu
                     bind PageDown copy-mode -ed

       A number of preset arrangements of panes are available, these are called layouts.  These may be  selected
       with the <b>select-layout</b> command or cycled with <b>next-layout</b> (bound to ‘Space’ by default); once a layout is
       chosen, panes within it may be moved and resized as normal.

       The following layouts are supported:

       <b>even-horizontal</b>
               Panes are spread out evenly from left to right across the window.

       <b>even-vertical</b>
               Panes are spread evenly from top to bottom.

       <b>main-horizontal</b>
               A  large  (main)  pane  is shown at the top of the window and the remaining panes are spread from
               left to right in the leftover space at the bottom.  Use the  <u>main-pane-height</u>  window  option  to
               specify the height of the top pane.

       <b>main-horizontal-mirrored</b>
               The same as <b>main-horizontal</b> but mirrored so the main pane is at the bottom of the window.

       <b>main-vertical</b>
               A  large  (main)  pane is shown on the left of the window and the remaining panes are spread from
               top to bottom in the leftover space on the right.   Use  the  <u>main-pane-width</u>  window  option  to
               specify the width of the left pane.

       <b>main-vertical-mirrored</b>
               The same as <b>main-vertical</b> but mirrored so the main pane is on the right of the window.

       <b>tiled</b>   Panes are spread out as evenly as possible over the window in both rows and columns.

       In  addition,  <b>select-layout</b>  may  be  used  to apply a previously used layout - the <b>list-windows</b> command
       displays the layout of each window in a form suitable for use with <b>select-layout</b>.  For example:

             $ tmux list-windows
             0: ksh [159x48]
                 layout: bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}
             $ tmux select-layout 'bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}'

       <b>tmux</b> automatically adjusts the size of the layout for the current window size.  Note that a layout cannot
       be applied to a window with more panes than that from which the layout was originally defined.

       Commands related to windows and panes are as follows:

       <b>break-pane</b> [<b>-abdP</b>] [<b>-F</b> <u>format</u>] [<b>-n</b> <u>window-name</u>] [<b>-s</b> <u>src-pane</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>dst-window</u>]
                     (alias: <b>breakp</b>)
               Break <u>src-pane</u> off from its containing window to make it the only pane in <u>dst-window</u>.  With <b>-a</b> or
               <b>-b</b>, the window is moved to the next  index  after  or  before  (existing  windows  are  moved  if
               necessary).   If  <b>-d</b>  is given, the new window does not become the current window.  The <b>-P</b> option
               prints information about the new window after it has been  created.   By  default,  it  uses  the
               format  ‘#{session_name}:#{window_index}.#{pane_index}’  but  a different format may be specified
               with <b>-F</b>.

       <b>capture-pane</b> [<b>-aAepPqCJN</b>] [<b>-b</b> <u>buffer-name</u>] [<b>-E</b> <u>end-line</u>] [<b>-S</b> <u>start-line</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>]
                     (alias: <b>capturep</b>)
               Capture the contents of a pane.  If <b>-p</b> is given, the output goes  to  stdout,  otherwise  to  the
               buffer  specified  with  <b>-b</b>  or a new buffer if omitted.  If <b>-a</b> is given, the alternate screen is
               used, and the history is not accessible.  If  no  alternate  screen  exists,  an  error  will  be
               returned  unless  <b>-q</b> is given.  If <b>-e</b> is given, the output includes escape sequences for text and
               background attributes.  <b>-C</b> also escapes non-printable  characters  as  octal  \xxx.   <b>-T</b>  ignores
               trailing  positions that do not contain a character.  <b>-N</b> preserves trailing spaces at each line's
               end and <b>-J</b> preserves trailing spaces and joins any wrapped lines; <b>-J</b>  implies  <b>-T</b>.   <b>-P</b>  captures
               only  any  output that the pane has received that is the beginning of an as-yet incomplete escape
               sequence.

               <b>-S</b> and <b>-E</b> specify the starting and ending line numbers, zero is the first  line  of  the  visible
               pane and negative numbers are lines in the history.  ‘-’ to <b>-S</b> is the start of the history and to
               <b>-E</b> the end of the visible pane.  The default is to capture only the visible contents of the pane.

       <b>choose-client</b> [<b>-NrZ</b>] [<b>-F</b> <u>format</u>] [<b>-f</b> <u>filter</u>] [<b>-K</b> <u>key-format</u>] [<b>-O</b> <u>sort-order</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>] [<u>template</u>]
               Put  a  pane  into client mode, allowing a client to be selected interactively from a list.  Each
               client is shown on one line.  A shortcut key is shown  on  the  left  in  brackets  allowing  for
               immediate  choice, or the list may be navigated and an item chosen or otherwise manipulated using
               the keys below.  <b>-Z</b> zooms the pane.  The following keys may be used in client mode:

                     <b>Key</b>    <b>Function</b>
                     <b>Enter</b>  Choose selected client
                     <b>Up</b>     Select previous client
                     <b>Down</b>   Select next client
                     <b>C-s</b>    Search by name
                     <b>n</b>      Repeat last search forwards
                     <b>N</b>      Repeat last search backwards
                     <b>t</b>      Toggle if client is tagged
                     <b>T</b>      Tag no clients
                     <b>C-t</b>    Tag all clients
                     <b>d</b>      Detach selected client
                     <b>D</b>      Detach tagged clients
                     <b>x</b>      Detach and HUP selected client
                     <b>X</b>      Detach and HUP tagged clients
                     <b>z</b>      Suspend selected client
                     <b>Z</b>      Suspend tagged clients
                     <b>f</b>      Enter a format to filter items
                     <b>O</b>      Change sort field
                     <b>r</b>      Reverse sort order
                     <b>v</b>      Toggle preview
                     <b>q</b>      Exit mode

               After a client is chosen, ‘%%’ is replaced by the client name in <u>template</u> and the result executed
               as a command.  If <u>template</u> is not given, "detach-client -t '%%'" is used.

               <b>-O</b> specifies the initial sort field: one of ‘name’,  ‘size’,  ‘creation’  (time),  or  ‘activity’
               (time).  <b>-r</b> reverses the sort order.  <b>-f</b> specifies an initial filter: the filter is a format - if
               it  evaluates  to  zero,  the  item in the list is not shown, otherwise it is shown.  If a filter
               would lead to an empty list, it is ignored.  <b>-F</b> specifies the format for each item  in  the  list
               and  <b>-K</b> a format for each shortcut key; both are evaluated once for each line.  <b>-N</b> starts without
               the preview.  This command works only if at least one client is attached.

       <b>choose-tree</b> [<b>-GNrswZ</b>] [<b>-F</b> <u>format</u>] [<b>-f</b> <u>filter</u>] [<b>-K</b> <u>key-format</u>] [<b>-O</b> <u>sort-order</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>] [<u>template</u>]
               Put a pane into tree mode, where a session, window or pane may be  chosen  interactively  from  a
               tree.  Each session, window or pane is shown on one line.  A shortcut key is shown on the left in
               brackets  allowing  for  immediate  choice,  or  the  tree may be navigated and an item chosen or
               otherwise manipulated using the keys below.  <b>-s</b>  starts  with  sessions  collapsed  and  <b>-w</b>  with
               windows collapsed.  <b>-Z</b> zooms the pane.  The following keys may be used in tree mode:

                     <b>Key</b>    <b>Function</b>
                     <b>Enter</b>  Choose selected item
                     <b>Up</b>     Select previous item
                     <b>Down</b>   Select next item
                     <b>+</b>      Expand selected item
                     <b>-</b>      Collapse selected item
                     <b>M-+</b>    Expand all items
                     <b>M--</b>    Collapse all items
                     <b>x</b>      Kill selected item
                     <b>X</b>      Kill tagged items
                     <b>&lt;</b>      Scroll list of previews left
                     <b>&gt;</b>      Scroll list of previews right
                     <b>C-s</b>    Search by name
                     <b>m</b>      Set the marked pane
                     <b>M</b>      Clear the marked pane
                     <b>n</b>      Repeat last search forwards
                     <b>N</b>      Repeat last search backwards
                     <b>t</b>      Toggle if item is tagged
                     <b>T</b>      Tag no items
                     <b>C-t</b>    Tag all items
                     <b>:</b>      Run a command for each tagged item
                     <b>f</b>      Enter a format to filter items
                     <b>H</b>      Jump to the starting pane
                     <b>O</b>      Change sort field
                     <b>r</b>      Reverse sort order
                     <b>v</b>      Toggle preview
                     <b>q</b>      Exit mode

               After  a  session, window or pane is chosen, the first instance of ‘%%’ and all instances of ‘%1’
               are replaced by the target in <u>template</u> and the result executed as a command.  If <u>template</u> is  not
               given, "switch-client -t '%%'" is used.

               <b>-O</b>  specifies  the initial sort field: one of ‘index’, ‘name’, or ‘time’ (activity).  <b>-r</b> reverses
               the sort order.  <b>-f</b> specifies an initial filter: the filter is a format  -  if  it  evaluates  to
               zero,  the  item  in  the list is not shown, otherwise it is shown.  If a filter would lead to an
               empty list, it is ignored.  <b>-F</b> specifies the format for each item in the tree and <b>-K</b> a format for
               each shortcut key; both are evaluated once for each line.  <b>-N</b> starts  without  the  preview.   <b>-G</b>
               includes all sessions in any session groups in the tree rather than only the first.  This command
               works only if at least one client is attached.

       <b>customize-mode</b> [<b>-NZ</b>] [<b>-F</b> <u>format</u>] [<b>-f</b> <u>filter</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>] [<u>template</u>]
               Put a pane into customize mode, where options and key bindings may be browsed and modified from a
               list.   Option  values in the list are shown for the active pane in the current window.  <b>-Z</b> zooms
               the pane.  The following keys may be used in customize mode:

                     <b>Key</b>    <b>Function</b>
                     <b>Enter</b>  Set pane, window, session or global option value
                     <b>Up</b>     Select previous item
                     <b>Down</b>   Select next item
                     <b>+</b>      Expand selected item
                     <b>-</b>      Collapse selected item
                     <b>M-+</b>    Expand all items
                     <b>M--</b>    Collapse all items
                     <b>s</b>      Set option value or key attribute
                     <b>S</b>      Set global option value
                     <b>w</b>      Set window option value, if option is for pane and window
                     <b>d</b>      Set an option or key to the default
                     <b>D</b>      Set tagged options and tagged keys to the default
                     <b>u</b>      Unset an option (set to default value if global) or unbind a key
                     <b>U</b>      Unset tagged options and unbind tagged keys
                     <b>C-s</b>    Search by name
                     <b>n</b>      Repeat last search forwards
                     <b>N</b>      Repeat last search backwards
                     <b>t</b>      Toggle if item is tagged
                     <b>T</b>      Tag no items
                     <b>C-t</b>    Tag all items
                     <b>f</b>      Enter a format to filter items
                     <b>v</b>      Toggle option information
                     <b>q</b>      Exit mode

               <b>-f</b> specifies an initial filter: the filter is a format - if it evaluates to zero, the item in the
               list is not shown, otherwise it is shown.  If a filter  would  lead  to  an  empty  list,  it  is
               ignored.   <b>-F</b>  specifies  the  format  for  each  item in the tree.  <b>-N</b> starts without the option
               information.  This command works only if at least one client is attached.

       <b>display-panes</b> [<b>-bN</b>] [<b>-d</b> <u>duration</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-client</u>] [<u>template</u>]
                     (alias: <b>displayp</b>)
               Display a visible indicator of each pane shown by <u>target-client</u>.   See  the  <b>display-panes-colour</b>
               and  <b>display-panes-active-colour</b>  session options.  The indicator is closed when a key is pressed
               (unless  <b>-N</b>  is  given)  or  <u>duration</u>  milliseconds  have  passed.    If   <b>-d</b>   is   not   given,
               <b>display-panes-time</b> is used.  A duration of zero means the indicator stays until a key is pressed.
               While the indicator is on screen, a pane may be chosen with the ‘0’ to ‘9’ keys, which will cause
               <u>template</u>  to be executed as a command with ‘%%’ substituted by the pane ID.  The default <u>template</u>
               is "select-pane -t '%%'".  With <b>-b</b>, other  commands  are  not  blocked  from  running  until  the
               indicator is closed.

       <b>find-window</b> [<b>-iCNrTZ</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>] <u>match-string</u>
                     (alias: <b>findw</b>)
               Search  for  a  <u><a href="../man3/fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch</a></u>(3)  pattern or, with <b>-r</b>, regular expression <u>match-string</u> in window names,
               titles, and visible content (but not history).  The flags control matching behavior:  <b>-C</b>  matches
               only  visible  window  contents,  <b>-N</b>  matches only the window name and <b>-T</b> matches only the window
               title.  <b>-i</b> makes the search ignore case.  The default is <b>-CNT</b>.  <b>-Z</b> zooms the pane.

               This command works only if at least one client is attached.

       <b>join-pane</b> [<b>-bdfhv</b>] [<b>-l</b> <u>size</u>] [<b>-s</b> <u>src-pane</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>dst-pane</u>]
                     (alias: <b>joinp</b>)
               Like <b>split-window</b>, but instead of splitting <u>dst-pane</u> and creating a new pane, split it  and  move
               <u>src-pane</u>  into the space.  This can be used to reverse <b>break-pane</b>.  The <b>-b</b> option causes <u>src-pane</u>
               to be joined to left of or above <u>dst-pane</u>.

               If <b>-s</b> is omitted and a marked pane is present (see <b>select-pane</b>  <b>-m</b>),  the  marked  pane  is  used
               rather than the current pane.

       <b>kill-pane</b> [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>]
                     (alias: <b>killp</b>)
               Destroy  the given pane.  If no panes remain in the containing window, it is also destroyed.  The
               <b>-a</b> option kills all but the pane given with <b>-t</b>.

       <b>kill-window</b> [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-window</u>]
                     (alias: <b>killw</b>)
               Kill the current window or the window at <u>target-window</u>, removing it from any sessions to which it
               is linked.  The <b>-a</b> option kills all but the window given with <b>-t</b>.

       <b>last-pane</b> [<b>-deZ</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-window</u>]
                     (alias: <b>lastp</b>)
               Select the last (previously selected) pane.  <b>-Z</b> keeps the window zoomed if  it  was  zoomed.   <b>-e</b>
               enables or <b>-d</b> disables input to the pane.

       <b>last-window</b> [<b>-t</b> <u>target-session</u>]
                     (alias: <b>last</b>)
               Select the last (previously selected) window.  If no <u>target-session</u> is specified, select the last
               window of the current session.

       <b>link-window</b> [<b>-abdk</b>] [<b>-s</b> <u>src-window</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>dst-window</u>]
                     (alias: <b>linkw</b>)
               Link  the  window  at  <u>src-window</u> to the specified <u>dst-window</u>.  If <u>dst-window</u> is specified and no
               such window exists, the <u>src-window</u> is linked there.  With <b>-a</b> or <b>-b</b> the window  is  moved  to  the
               next  index after or before <u>dst-window</u> (existing windows are moved if necessary).  If <b>-k</b> is given
               and <u>dst-window</u> exists, it is killed, otherwise an error is generated.  If <b>-d</b> is given, the  newly
               linked window is not selected.

       <b>list-panes</b> [<b>-as</b>] [<b>-F</b> <u>format</u>] [<b>-f</b> <u>filter</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target</u>]
                     (alias: <b>lsp</b>)
               If <b>-a</b> is given, <u>target</u> is ignored and all panes on the server are listed.  If <b>-s</b> is given, <u>target</u>
               is  a  session (or the current session).  If neither is given, <u>target</u> is a window (or the current
               window).  <b>-F</b> specifies the format of each line and <b>-f</b> a filter.  Only panes for which the  filter
               is true are shown.  See the “FORMATS” section.

       <b>list-windows</b> [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-F</b> <u>format</u>] [<b>-f</b> <u>filter</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-session</u>]
                     (alias: <b>lsw</b>)
               If  <b>-a</b>  is given, list all windows on the server.  Otherwise, list windows in the current session
               or in <u>target-session</u>.  <b>-F</b> specifies the format of each line and <b>-f</b> a filter.   Only  windows  for
               which the filter is true are shown.  See the “FORMATS” section.

       <b>move-pane</b> [<b>-bdfhv</b>] [<b>-l</b> <u>size</u>] [<b>-s</b> <u>src-pane</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>dst-pane</u>]
                     (alias: <b>movep</b>)
               Does the same as <b>join-pane</b>.

       <b>move-window</b> [<b>-abrdk</b>] [<b>-s</b> <u>src-window</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>dst-window</u>]
                     (alias: <b>movew</b>)
               This is similar to <b>link-window</b>, except the window at <u>src-window</u> is moved to <u>dst-window</u>.  With <b>-r</b>,
               all windows in the session are renumbered in sequential order, respecting the <b>base-index</b> option.

       <b>new-window</b>   [<b>-abdkPS</b>]   [<b>-c</b>   <u>start-directory</u>]   [<b>-e</b>  <u>environment</u>]  [<b>-F</b>  <u>format</u>]  [<b>-n</b>  <u>window-name</u>]  [<b>-t</b>
               <u>target-window</u>] [<u>shell-command</u>]
                     (alias: <b>neww</b>)
               Create a new window.  With <b>-a</b> or <b>-b</b>, the new window is inserted at the next index after or before
               the specified <u>target-window</u>, moving windows up if necessary; otherwise <u>target-window</u> is  the  new
               window location.

               If  <b>-d</b>  is  given,  the  session  does not make the new window the current window.  <u>target-window</u>
               represents the window to be created; if the target already exists an error is shown,  unless  the
               <b>-k</b>  flag  is  used, in which case it is destroyed.  If <b>-S</b> is given and a window named <u>window-name</u>
               already exists, it is selected (unless <b>-d</b> is also given in which case the command does nothing).

               <u>shell-command</u> is the command to execute.  If <u>shell-command</u> is not specified,  the  value  of  the
               <b>default-command</b>  option  is  used.  <b>-c</b> specifies the working directory in which the new window is
               created.

               When the shell command completes, the window closes.  See the  <b>remain-on-exit</b>  option  to  change
               this behaviour.

               <b>-e</b> takes the form ‘VARIABLE=value’ and sets an environment variable for the newly created window;
               it may be specified multiple times.

               The  TERM  environment variable must be set to ‘screen’ or ‘tmux’ for all programs running <u>inside</u>
               <b>tmux</b>.  New windows will automatically have ‘TERM=screen’ added to  their  environment,  but  care
               must be taken not to reset this in shell start-up files or by the <b>-e</b> option.

               The  <b>-P</b> option prints information about the new window after it has been created.  By default, it
               uses the format ‘#{session_name}:#{window_index}’ but a different format may  be  specified  with
               <b>-F</b>.

       <b>next-layout</b> [<b>-t</b> <u>target-window</u>]
                     (alias: <b>nextl</b>)
               Move a window to the next layout and rearrange the panes to fit.

       <b>next-window</b> [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-session</u>]
                     (alias: <b>next</b>)
               Move to the next window in the session.  If <b>-a</b> is used, move to the next window with an alert.

       <b>pipe-pane</b> [<b>-IOo</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>] [<u>shell-command</u>]
                     (alias: <b>pipep</b>)
               Pipe output sent by the program in <u>target-pane</u> to a shell command or vice versa.  A pane may only
               be  connected  to  one  command  at  a  time, any existing pipe is closed before <u>shell-command</u> is
               executed.  The <u>shell-command</u> string may contain the special character sequences supported by  the
               <b>status-left</b> option.  If no <u>shell-command</u> is given, the current pipe (if any) is closed.

               <b>-I</b>  and  <b>-O</b>  specify which of the <u>shell-command</u> output streams are connected to the pane: with <b>-I</b>
               stdout is connected (so anything <u>shell-command</u> prints is written  to  the  pane  as  if  it  were
               typed);  with  <b>-O</b> stdin is connected (so any output in the pane is piped to <u>shell-command</u>).  Both
               may be used together and if neither are specified, <b>-O</b> is used.

               The <b>-o</b> option only opens a new pipe if no previous pipe exists, allowing a  pipe  to  be  toggled
               with a single key, for example:

                     bind-key C-p pipe-pane -o 'cat &gt;&gt;<a href="file:~/output.">~/output.</a>#I-#P'

       <b>previous-layout</b> [<b>-t</b> <u>target-window</u>]
                     (alias: <b>prevl</b>)
               Move to the previous layout in the session.

       <b>previous-window</b> [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-session</u>]
                     (alias: <b>prev</b>)
               Move to the previous window in the session.  With <b>-a</b>, move to the previous window with an alert.

       <b>rename-window</b> [<b>-t</b> <u>target-window</u>] <u>new-name</u>
                     (alias: <b>renamew</b>)
               Rename the current window, or the window at <u>target-window</u> if specified, to <u>new-name</u>.

       <b>resize-pane</b> [<b>-DLMRTUZ</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>] [<b>-x</b> <u>width</u>] [<b>-y</b> <u>height</u>] [<u>adjustment</u>]
                     (alias: <b>resizep</b>)
               Resize  a  pane,  up,  down, left or right by <u>adjustment</u> with <b>-U</b>, <b>-D</b>, <b>-L</b> or <b>-R</b>, or to an absolute
               size with <b>-x</b> or <b>-y</b>.  The <u>adjustment</u> is given in lines or columns (the default is 1);  <b>-x</b>  and  <b>-y</b>
               may  be a given as a number of lines or columns or followed by ‘%’ for a percentage of the window
               size (for example ‘-x 10%’).  With <b>-Z</b>, the active pane is toggled between zoomed  (occupying  the
               whole of the window) and unzoomed (its normal position in the layout).

               <b>-M</b> begins mouse resizing (only valid if bound to a mouse key binding, see “MOUSE SUPPORT”).

               <b>-T</b>  trims  all  lines  below  the  current  cursor position and moves lines out of the history to
               replace them.

       <b>resize-window</b> [<b>-aADLRU</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-window</u>] [<b>-x</b> <u>width</u>] [<b>-y</b> <u>height</u>] [<u>adjustment</u>]
                     (alias: <b>resizew</b>)
               Resize a window, up, down, left or right by <u>adjustment</u> with <b>-U</b>, <b>-D</b>, <b>-L</b> or <b>-R</b>, or to  an  absolute
               size  with  <b>-x</b> or <b>-y</b>.  The <u>adjustment</u> is given in lines or cells (the default is 1).  <b>-A</b> sets the
               size of the largest session containing the window; <b>-a</b> the size of  the  smallest.   This  command
               will automatically set <b>window-size</b> to manual in the window options.

       <b>respawn-pane</b> [<b>-k</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>start-directory</u>] [<b>-e</b> <u>environment</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>] [<u>shell-command</u>]
                     (alias: <b>respawnp</b>)
               Reactivate  a  pane  in  which the command has exited (see the <b>remain-on-exit</b> window option).  If
               <u>shell-command</u> is not given, the command used when the pane  was  created  or  last  respawned  is
               executed.   The  pane  must  be  already inactive, unless <b>-k</b> is given, in which case any existing
               command is killed.  <b>-c</b> specifies a new working directory for the pane.  The  <b>-e</b>  option  has  the
               same meaning as for the <b>new-window</b> command.

       <b>respawn-window</b> [<b>-k</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>start-directory</u>] [<b>-e</b> <u>environment</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-window</u>] [<u>shell-command</u>]
                     (alias: <b>respawnw</b>)
               Reactivate  a  window in which the command has exited (see the <b>remain-on-exit</b> window option).  If
               <u>shell-command</u> is not given, the command used when the window was created  or  last  respawned  is
               executed.   The  window  must be already inactive, unless <b>-k</b> is given, in which case any existing
               command is killed.  <b>-c</b> specifies a new working directory for the window.  The <b>-e</b> option  has  the
               same meaning as for the <b>new-window</b> command.

       <b>rotate-window</b> [<b>-DUZ</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-window</u>]
                     (alias: <b>rotatew</b>)
               Rotate  the  positions of the panes within a window, either upward (numerically lower) with <b>-U</b> or
               downward (numerically higher).  <b>-Z</b> keeps the window zoomed if it was zoomed.

       <b>select-layout</b> [<b>-Enop</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>] [<u>layout-name</u>]
                     (alias: <b>selectl</b>)
               Choose a specific layout for a window.  If <u>layout-name</u> is not given, the last preset layout  used
               (if any) is reapplied.  <b>-n</b> and <b>-p</b> are equivalent to the <b>next-layout</b> and <b>previous-layout</b> commands.
               <b>-o</b>  applies  the  last set layout if possible (undoes the most recent layout change).  <b>-E</b> spreads
               the current pane and any panes next to it out evenly.

       <b>select-pane</b> [<b>-DdeLlMmRUZ</b>] [<b>-T</b> <u>title</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>]
                     (alias: <b>selectp</b>)
               Make pane <u>target-pane</u> the active pane in its window.  If one of  <b>-D</b>,  <b>-L</b>,  <b>-R</b>,  or  <b>-U</b>  is  used,
               respectively  the  pane  below,  to the left, to the right, or above the target pane is used.  <b>-Z</b>
               keeps the window zoomed if it was zoomed.  <b>-l</b> is the same as using  the  <b>last-pane</b>  command.   <b>-e</b>
               enables or <b>-d</b> disables input to the pane.  <b>-T</b> sets the pane title.

               <b>-m</b> and <b>-M</b> are used to set and clear the <u>marked</u> <u>pane</u>.  There is one marked pane at a time, setting
               a  new  marked  pane clears the last.  The marked pane is the default target for <b>-s</b> to <b>join-pane</b>,
               <b>move-pane</b>, <b>swap-pane</b> and <b>swap-window</b>.

       <b>select-window</b> [<b>-lnpT</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-window</u>]
                     (alias: <b>selectw</b>)
               Select the window at <u>target-window</u>.  <b>-l</b>, <b>-n</b> and <b>-p</b> are equivalent to the <b>last-window</b>, <b>next-window</b>
               and <b>previous-window</b> commands.  If <b>-T</b> is given and the selected  window  is  already  the  current
               window, the command behaves like <b>last-window</b>.

       <b>split-window</b> [<b>-bdfhIvPZ</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>start-directory</u>] [<b>-e</b> <u>environment</u>] [<b>-l</b> <u>size</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>] [<u>shell-command</u>]
               [<b>-F</b> <u>format</u>]
                     (alias: <b>splitw</b>)
               Create  a  new pane by splitting <u>target-pane</u>: <b>-h</b> does a horizontal split and <b>-v</b> a vertical split;
               if neither is specified, <b>-v</b> is assumed.  The <b>-l</b> option specifies the size  of  the  new  pane  in
               lines  (for  vertical split) or in columns (for horizontal split); <u>size</u> may be followed by ‘%’ to
               specify a percentage of the available space.  The <b>-b</b> option causes the new pane to be created  to
               the  left  of  or  above  <u>target-pane</u>.  The <b>-f</b> option creates a new pane spanning the full window
               height (with <b>-h</b>) or full window width (with <b>-v</b>), instead of splitting the active pane.  <b>-Z</b>  zooms
               if the window is not zoomed, or keeps it zoomed if already zoomed.

               An empty <u>shell-command</u> ('') will create a pane with no command running in it.  Output can be sent
               to  such a pane with the <b>display-message</b> command.  The <b>-I</b> flag (if <u>shell-command</u> is not specified
               or empty) will create an empty pane and forward any output from stdin to it.  For example:

                     $ make 2&gt;&amp;1|tmux splitw -dI &amp;

               All other options have the same meaning as for the <b>new-window</b> command.

       <b>swap-pane</b> [<b>-dDUZ</b>] [<b>-s</b> <u>src-pane</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>dst-pane</u>]
                     (alias: <b>swapp</b>)
               Swap two panes.  If <b>-U</b> is used and no source pane is specified with <b>-s</b>, <u>dst-pane</u> is swapped  with
               the  previous  pane  (before it numerically); <b>-D</b> swaps with the next pane (after it numerically).
               <b>-d</b> instructs <b>tmux</b> not to change the active pane and <b>-Z</b> keeps the window zoomed if it was zoomed.

               If <b>-s</b> is omitted and a marked pane is present (see <b>select-pane</b>  <b>-m</b>),  the  marked  pane  is  used
               rather than the current pane.

       <b>swap-window</b> [<b>-d</b>] [<b>-s</b> <u>src-window</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>dst-window</u>]
                     (alias: <b>swapw</b>)
               This  is similar to <b>link-window</b>, except the source and destination windows are swapped.  It is an
               error if no window exists at <u>src-window</u>.  If <b>-d</b> is given, the new  window  does  not  become  the
               current window.

               If  <b>-s</b>  is  omitted  and a marked pane is present (see <b>select-pane</b> <b>-m</b>), the window containing the
               marked pane is used rather than the current window.

       <b>unlink-window</b> [<b>-k</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-window</u>]
                     (alias: <b>unlinkw</b>)
               Unlink <u>target-window</u>.  Unless <b>-k</b> is given, a window may be unlinked  only  if  it  is  linked  to
               multiple  sessions  - windows may not be linked to no sessions; if <b>-k</b> is specified and the window
               is linked to only one session, it is unlinked and destroyed.

</pre><h4><b>KEY</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tmux</b> allows a command to be bound to most keys, with or without a prefix key.  When specifying keys, most
       represent themselves (for example ‘A’ to ‘Z’).  Ctrl keys may be prefixed with ‘C-’ or  ‘^’,  Shift  keys
       with ‘S-’ and Alt (meta) with ‘M-’.  In addition, the following special key names are accepted: <u>Up</u>, <u>Down</u>,
       <u>Left</u>,   <u>Right</u>,   <u>BSpace</u>,  <u>BTab</u>,  <u>DC</u>  (Delete),  <u>End</u>,  <u>Enter</u>,  <u>Escape</u>,  <u>F1</u>  to  <u>F12</u>,  <u>Home</u>,  <u>IC</u>  (Insert),
       <u>NPage/PageDown/PgDn</u>, <u>PPage/PageUp/PgUp</u>, <u>Space</u>, and <u>Tab</u>.  Note that to bind the ‘"’ or ‘'’ keys, quotation
       marks are necessary, for example:

             bind-key '"' split-window
             bind-key "'" new-window

       A command bound to the <u>Any</u> key will execute for all keys which do not have a more specific binding.

       Commands related to key bindings are as follows:

       <b>bind-key</b> [<b>-nr</b>] [<b>-N</b> <u>note</u>] [<b>-T</b> <u>key-table</u>] <u>key</u> <u>command</u> [<u>argument</u> <u>...</u>]
                     (alias: <b>bind</b>)
               Bind key <u>key</u> to <u>command</u>.  Keys are bound in a key table.  By default (without  -T),  the  key  is
               bound  in  the  <u>prefix</u>  key table.  This table is used for keys pressed after the prefix key (for
               example, by default ‘c’ is bound to <b>new-window</b> in the <u>prefix</u> table, so  ‘C-b  c’  creates  a  new
               window).   The  <u>root</u>  table  is  used  for  keys  pressed  without the prefix key: binding ‘c’ to
               <b>new-window</b> in the <u>root</u> table (not recommended) means a plain ‘c’ will create a new window.  <b>-n</b> is
               an alias for <b>-T</b> <u>root</u>.  Keys may also be bound in custom  key  tables  and  the  <b>switch-client</b>  <b>-T</b>
               command  used  to  switch to them from a key binding.  The <b>-r</b> flag indicates this key may repeat,
               see the <b>repeat-time</b> option.  <b>-N</b> attaches a note to the key (shown with <b>list-keys</b> <b>-N</b>).

               To view the default bindings and possible commands, see the <b>list-keys</b> command.

       <b>list-keys</b> [<b>-1aN</b>] [<b>-P</b> <u>prefix-string</u> <b>-T</b> <u>key-table</u>] [<u>key</u>]
                     (alias: <b>lsk</b>)
               List key bindings.  There are two forms: the default lists keys as <b>bind-key</b>  commands;  <b>-N</b>  lists
               only keys with attached notes and shows only the key and note for each key.

               With the default form, all key tables are listed by default.  <b>-T</b> lists only keys in <u>key-table</u>.

               With  the  <b>-N</b>  form,  only  keys in the <u>root</u> and <u>prefix</u> key tables are listed by default; <b>-T</b> also
               lists only keys in <u>key-table</u>.  <b>-P</b> specifies a prefix to print before each key and <b>-1</b>  lists  only
               the  first  matching  key.   <b>-a</b>  lists  the  command for keys that do not have a note rather than
               skipping them.

       <b>send-keys</b> [<b>-FHKlMRX</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>target-client</u>] [<b>-N</b> <u>repeat-count</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>] <u>key</u> <u>...</u>
                     (alias: <b>send</b>)
               Send a key or keys to a window or client.  Each argument <u>key</u> is the name  of  the  key  (such  as
               ‘C-a’  or  ‘NPage’)  to send; if the string is not recognised as a key, it is sent as a series of
               characters.  If <b>-K</b> is given, keys are sent to  <u>target-client</u>,  so  they  are  looked  up  in  the
               client's  key  table, rather than to <u>target-pane</u>.  All arguments are sent sequentially from first
               to last.  If no keys are given and the command is bound to a key, then that key is used.

               The <b>-l</b> flag disables key name lookup and processes the keys as literal UTF-8 characters.  The  <b>-H</b>
               flag expects each key to be a hexadecimal number for an ASCII character.

               The <b>-R</b> flag causes the terminal state to be reset.

               <b>-M</b>  passes  through  a  mouse  event  (only  valid  if  bound  to a mouse key binding, see “MOUSE
               SUPPORT”).

               <b>-X</b> is used to send a command into copy mode - see the “WINDOWS AND PANES” section.  <b>-N</b>  specifies
               a repeat count and <b>-F</b> expands formats in arguments where appropriate.

       <b>send-prefix</b> [<b>-2</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>]
               Send the prefix key, or with <b>-2</b> the secondary prefix key, to a window as if it was pressed.

       <b>unbind-key</b> [<b>-anq</b>] [<b>-T</b> <u>key-table</u>] <u>key</u>
                     (alias: <b>unbind</b>)
               Unbind  the command bound to <u>key</u>.  <b>-n</b> and <b>-T</b> are the same as for <b>bind-key</b>.  If <b>-a</b> is present, all
               key bindings are removed.  The <b>-q</b> option prevents errors being returned.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The appearance and behaviour of <b>tmux</b> may be modified by changing the value of various options.  There are
       four types of option: <u>server</u> <u>options</u>, <u>session</u> <u>options</u>, <u>window</u> <u>options</u>, and <u>pane</u> <u>options</u>.

       The <b>tmux</b> server has a set of global server options which do not apply to any particular window or session
       or pane.  These are altered with the <b>set-option</b>  <b>-s</b>  command,  or  displayed  with  the  <b>show-options</b>  <b>-s</b>
       command.

       In  addition,  each  individual session may have a set of session options, and there is a separate set of
       global session options.  Sessions which do not have a particular option configured inherit the value from
       the global session options.  Session options are set or unset with the  <b>set-option</b>  command  and  may  be
       listed  with  the  <b>show-options</b>  command.   The available server and session options are listed under the
       <b>set-option</b> command.

       Similarly, a set of window options is attached to each window and a set of pane  options  to  each  pane.
       Pane  options  inherit  from window options.  This means any pane option may be set as a window option to
       apply the option to all panes in the window without the option set, for example these commands  will  set
       the background colour to red for all panes except pane 0:

             set -w window-style bg=red
             set -pt:.0 window-style bg=blue

       There  is  also a set of global window options from which any unset window or pane options are inherited.
       Window and pane options are altered with <b>set-option</b> <b>-w</b> and <b>-p</b> commands and displayed with <b>show-option</b>  <b>-w</b>
       and <b>-p</b>.

       <b>tmux</b>  also  supports user options which are prefixed with a ‘@’.  User options may have any name, so long
       as they are prefixed with ‘@’, and be set to any string.  For example:

             $ tmux set -wq @foo "abc123"
             $ tmux show -wv @foo
             abc123

       Commands which set options are as follows:

       <b>set-option</b> [<b>-aFgopqsuUw</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>] <u>option</u> <u>value</u>
                     (alias: <b>set</b>)
               Set a pane option with <b>-p</b>, a window option with <b>-w</b>, a server option with <b>-s</b>, otherwise a  session
               option.   If  the  option is not a user option, <b>-w</b> or <b>-s</b> may be unnecessary - <b>tmux</b> will infer the
               type from the option name, assuming <b>-w</b> for pane options.  If <b>-g</b> is given, the global  session  or
               window option is set.

               <b>-F</b>  expands formats in the option value.  The <b>-u</b> flag unsets an option, so a session inherits the
               option from the global options (or with <b>-g</b>, restores a global option to the default).  <b>-U</b>  unsets
               an option (like <b>-u</b>) but if the option is a pane option also unsets the option on any panes in the
               window.   <u>value</u>  depends  on  the  option  and  may be a number, a string, or a flag (on, off, or
               omitted to toggle).

               The <b>-o</b> flag prevents setting an option that is already set and  the  <b>-q</b>  flag  suppresses  errors
               about unknown or ambiguous options.

               With  <b>-a</b>,  and  if  the  option  expects  a  string or a style, <u>value</u> is appended to the existing
               setting.  For example:

                     set -g status-left "foo"
                     set -ag status-left "bar"

               Will result in ‘foobar’.  And:

                     set -g status-style "bg=red"
                     set -ag status-style "fg=blue"

               Will result in a red background <u>and</u> blue foreground.  Without <b>-a</b>, the result would be the default
               background and a blue foreground.

       <b>show-options</b> [<b>-AgHpqsvw</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>] [<u>option</u>]
                     (alias: <b>show</b>)
               Show the pane options (or a single option if <u>option</u> is provided) with <b>-p</b>, the window options with
               <b>-w</b>, the server options with <b>-s</b>, otherwise the session options.  If  the  option  is  not  a  user
               option,  <b>-w</b> or <b>-s</b> may be unnecessary - <b>tmux</b> will infer the type from the option name, assuming <b>-w</b>
               for pane options.  Global session or window options are listed if <b>-g</b> is used.  <b>-v</b> shows only  the
               option  value,  not  the  name.   If <b>-q</b> is set, no error will be returned if <u>option</u> is unset.  <b>-H</b>
               includes hooks (omitted by default).  <b>-A</b> includes options inherited from a parent set of options,
               such options are marked with an asterisk.

       Available server options are:

       <b>backspace</b> <u>key</u>
               Set the key sent by <b>tmux</b> for backspace.

       <b>buffer-limit</b> <u>number</u>
               Set the number of buffers; as new buffers are added to the top of the stack, old ones are removed
               from the bottom if necessary to maintain this maximum length.

       <b>command-alias[]</b> <u>name=value</u>
               This is an array of custom aliases for commands.  If an  unknown  command  matches  <u>name</u>,  it  is
               replaced with <u>value</u>.  For example, after:

                     <b>set</b> <b>-s</b> <b>command-alias[100]</b> <b>zoom='resize-pane</b> <b>-Z'</b>

               Using:

                     <b>zoom</b> <b>-t:.1</b>

               Is equivalent to:

                     <b>resize-pane</b> <b>-Z</b> <b>-t:.1</b>

               Note  that  aliases  are  expanded  when  a command is parsed rather than when it is executed, so
               binding an alias with <b>bind-key</b> will bind the expanded form.

       <b>copy-command</b> <u>shell-command</u>
               Give the command to pipe to if the <b>copy-pipe</b> copy mode command is used without arguments.

       <b>default-terminal</b> <u>terminal</u>
               Set the default terminal for new windows created in this session - the default value of the  TERM
               environment  variable.   For  <b>tmux</b>  to  work correctly, this <u>must</u> be set to ‘screen’, ‘tmux’ or a
               derivative of them.

       <b>escape-time</b> <u>time</u>
               Set the time in milliseconds for which <b>tmux</b> waits after an escape is input to determine if it  is
               part of a function or meta key sequences.

       <b>editor</b> <u>shell-command</u>
               Set the command used when <b>tmux</b> runs an editor.

       <b>exit-empty</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
               If enabled (the default), the server will exit when there are no active sessions.

       <b>exit-unattached</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
               If enabled, the server will exit when there are no attached clients.

       <b>extended-keys</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b> | <b>always</b>]
               Controls  how  modified  keys  (keys pressed together with Control, Meta, or Shift) are reported.
               This is the equivalent of the <b>modifyOtherKeys</b> <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1) resource.

               When set to <b>on</b>, the program inside the pane can request one of two modes: mode  1  which  changes
               the  sequence  for  only  keys  which lack an existing well-known representation; or mode 2 which
               changes the sequence for all keys.  When set to <b>always</b>, modes 1 and 2 can still be  requested  by
               applications,  but  mode  1  will  be forced instead of the standard mode.  When set to <b>off</b>, this
               feature is disabled and only standard keys are reported.

               <b>tmux</b> will always request extended keys itself if  the  terminal  supports  them.   See  also  the
               <b>extkeys</b>  feature  for  the  <b>terminal-features</b>  option,  the  <b>extended-keys-format</b>  option and the
               <b>pane_key_mode</b> variable.

       <b>extended-keys-format</b> [<b>csi-u</b> | <b>xterm</b>]
               Selects one of the two possible formats for reporting modified keys to applications.  This is the
               equivalent of the <b>formatOtherKeys</b> <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1) resource.  For example,  C-S-a  will  be  reported  as
               ‘^[[27;6;65~’ when set to <b>xterm</b>, and as ‘^[[65;6u’ when set to <b>csi-u</b>.

       <b>focus-events</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
               When  enabled,  focus  events  are requested from the terminal if supported and passed through to
               applications running in <b>tmux</b>.  Attached clients should  be  detached  and  attached  again  after
               changing this option.

       <b>history-file</b> <u>path</u>
               If  not empty, a file to which <b>tmux</b> will write command prompt history on exit and load it from on
               start.

       <b>message-limit</b> <u>number</u>
               Set the number of error or information messages to save in the message log for each client.

       <b>prompt-history-limit</b> <u>number</u>
               Set the number of history items to save in the history file for each type of command prompt.

       <b>set-clipboard</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>external</b> | <b>off</b>]
               Attempt to set the terminal clipboard content using the <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1) escape sequence, if there is  an
               <u>Ms</u> entry in the <u><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></u>(5) description (see the “TERMINFO EXTENSIONS” section).

               If set to <b>on</b>, <b>tmux</b> will both accept the escape sequence to create a buffer and attempt to set the
               terminal  clipboard.   If  set  to  <b>external</b>, <b>tmux</b> will attempt to set the terminal clipboard but
               ignore attempts by applications to set <b>tmux</b> buffers.   If  <b>off</b>,  <b>tmux</b>  will  neither  accept  the
               clipboard escape sequence nor attempt to set the clipboard.

               Note that this feature needs to be enabled in <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1) by setting the resource:

                     disallowedWindowOps: 20,21,SetXprop

               Or changing this property from the <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1) interactive menu when required.

       <b>terminal-features[]</b> <u>string</u>
               Set terminal features for terminal types read from <u><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></u>(5).  <b>tmux</b> has a set of named terminal
               features.  Each will apply appropriate changes to the <u><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></u>(5) entry in use.

               <b>tmux</b>  can detect features for a few common terminals; this option can be used to easily tell tmux
               about features supported by terminals it cannot detect.   The  <b>terminal-overrides</b>  option  allows
               individual  <u><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></u>(5) capabilities to be set instead, <b>terminal-features</b> is intended for classes
               of functionality supported in a standard way but not reported by <u><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></u>(5).  Care must be taken
               to configure this only with features the terminal actually supports.

               This is an array option where each entry is a colon-separated string made up of a  terminal  type
               pattern  (matched  using  <u><a href="../man3/fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch</a></u>(3))  followed  by  a  list of terminal features.  The available
               features are:

               256     Supports 256 colours with the SGR escape sequences.

               clipboard
                       Allows setting the system clipboard.

               ccolour
                       Allows setting the cursor colour.

               cstyle  Allows setting the cursor style.

               extkeys
                       Supports extended keys.

               focus   Supports focus reporting.

               hyperlinks
                       Supports OSC 8 hyperlinks.

               ignorefkeys
                       Ignore function keys from <u><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></u>(5) and use the <b>tmux</b> internal set only.

               margins
                       Supports DECSLRM margins.

               mouse   Supports <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1) mouse sequences.

               osc7    Supports the OSC 7 working directory extension.

               overline
                       Supports the overline SGR attribute.

               rectfill
                       Supports the DECFRA rectangle fill escape sequence.

               RGB     Supports RGB colour with the SGR escape sequences.

               sixel   Supports SIXEL graphics.

               strikethrough
                       Supports the strikethrough SGR escape sequence.

               sync    Supports synchronized updates.

               title   Supports <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1) title setting.

               usstyle
                       Allows underscore style and colour to be set.

       <b>terminal-overrides[]</b> <u>string</u>
               Allow terminal descriptions read using <u><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></u>(5) to be overridden.   Each  entry  is  a  colon-
               separated  string  made  up  of  a  terminal type pattern (matched using <u><a href="../man3/fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch</a></u>(3)) and a set of
               <u>name=value</u> entries.

               For example, to set the ‘clear’ <u><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></u>(5) entry to ‘\e[H\e[2J’ for all terminal types  matching
               ‘rxvt*’:

                     <b>rxvt*:clear=\e[H\e[2J</b>

               The terminal entry value is passed through <u><a href="../man3/strunvis.3.html">strunvis</a></u>(3) before interpretation.

       <b>user-keys[]</b> <u>key</u>
               Set list of user-defined key escape sequences.  Each item is associated with a key named ‘User0’,
               ‘User1’, and so on.

               For example:

                     set -s user-keys[0] "\e[5;30012~"
                     bind User0 resize-pane -L 3

       Available session options are:

       <b>activity-action</b> [<b>any</b> | <b>none</b> | <b>current</b> | <b>other</b>]
               Set  action  on  window  activity  when <b>monitor-activity</b> is on.  <b>any</b> means activity in any window
               linked to a session causes a bell or message (depending on <b>visual-activity</b>) in the current window
               of that session, <b>none</b> means all activity is ignored (equivalent to <b>monitor-activity</b>  being  off),
               <b>current</b>  means only activity in windows other than the current window are ignored and <b>other</b> means
               activity in the current window is ignored but not those in other windows.

       <b>assume-paste-time</b> <u>milliseconds</u>
               If keys are entered faster than one in <u>milliseconds</u>, they are assumed to have been pasted  rather
               than  typed  and  <b>tmux</b>  key  bindings are not processed.  The default is one millisecond and zero
               disables.

       <b>base-index</b> <u>index</u>
               Set the base index from which an unused index should be searched when a new  window  is  created.
               The default is zero.

       <b>bell-action</b> [<b>any</b> | <b>none</b> | <b>current</b> | <b>other</b>]
               Set  action  on a bell in a window when <b>monitor-bell</b> is on.  The values are the same as those for

               If <b>on</b>, destroy the session after the last client has detached.  If <b>off</b> (the default),  leave  the
               session  orphaned.   If  <b>keep-last</b>,  destroy  the  session only if it is in a group and has other
               sessions in that group.  If <b>keep-group</b>, destroy the session unless it is in a group  and  is  the
               only session in that group.

       <b>detach-on-destroy</b> [<b>off</b> | <b>on</b> | <b>no-detached</b> | <b>previous</b> | <b>next</b>]
               If  <b>on</b> (the default), the client is detached when the session it is attached to is destroyed.  If
               <b>off</b>, the client is  switched  to  the  most  recently  active  of  the  remaining  sessions.   If
               <b>no-detached</b>,  the client is detached only if there are no detached sessions; if detached sessions
               exist, the client is switched to the most recently active.  If <b>previous</b> or <b>next</b>,  the  client  is
               switched to the previous or next session in alphabetical order.

       <b>mouse</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
               If  on,  <b>tmux</b>  captures  the  mouse and allows mouse events to be bound as key bindings.  See the
               “MOUSE SUPPORT” section for details.

       <b>prefix</b> <u>key</u>
               Set the key accepted as a prefix key.  In addition to the  standard  keys  described  under  “KEY
               BINDINGS”, <b>prefix</b> can be set to the special key ‘None’ to set no prefix.

       <b>prefix2</b> <u>key</u>

       <b>renumber-windows</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
               If on, when a window is closed  in  a  session,  automatically  renumber  the  other  windows  in
               numerical  order.   This  respects  the  <b>base-index</b>  option  if  it has been set.  If off, do not
               renumber the windows.

       <b>repeat-time</b> <u>time</u>
               Allow multiple commands to be entered without pressing the prefix-key again in the specified <u>time</u>
               milliseconds (the default is 500).  Whether a key repeats may be set when it is bound  using  the
               <b>-r</b> flag to <b>bind-key</b>.  Repeat is enabled for the default keys bound to the <b>resize-pane</b> command.

       <b>set-titles</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
               Attempt to set the client terminal title using the <u>tsl</u> and <u>fsl</u> <u><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></u>(5) entries if they exist.
               <b>tmux</b>  automatically  sets  these  to  the  \e]0;...\007  sequence  if  the terminal appears to be
               <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1).  This option is off by default.

       <b>set-titles-string</b> <u>string</u>

       <b>status</b> [<b>off</b> | <b>on</b> | <b>2</b> | <b>3</b> | <b>4</b> | <b>5</b>]
               Show or hide the status line or specify its size.  Using <b>on</b>  gives  a  status  line  one  row  in
               height; <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> or <b>5</b> more rows.

       <b>status-format[]</b> <u>format</u>
               Specify  the  format  to  be  used  for each line of the status line.  The default builds the top
               status line from the various individual status options below.

       <b>status-interval</b> <u>interval</u>
               Update the status line every <u>interval</u> seconds.  By default, updates will occur every 15  seconds.
               A setting of zero disables redrawing at interval.

       <b>status-justify</b> [<b>left</b> | <b>centre</b> | <b>right</b> | <b>absolute-centre</b>]
               Set  the  position of the window list in the status line: left, centre or right.  centre puts the
               window list in the relative centre of the available free space; absolute-centre uses  the  centre
               of the entire horizontal space.

       <b>status-keys</b> [<b>vi</b> | <b>emacs</b>]
               Use  vi  or  emacs-style key bindings in the status line, for example at the command prompt.  The
               default is emacs, unless the VISUAL or EDITOR environment  variables  are  set  and  contain  the
               string ‘vi’.

       <b>status-left</b> <u>string</u>
               Display  <u>string</u>  (by  default  the  session name) to the left of the status line.  <u>string</u> will be
               passed through <u><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a></u>(3).  Also see the “FORMATS” and “STYLES” sections.

               For details on how the names and titles can be set see the “NAMES AND TITLES” section.

               Examples are:

                     #(sysctl vm.loadavg)

               quotes, the date and the time  are  shown.   As  with  <b>status-left</b>,  <u>string</u>  will  be  passed  to
               <u><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a></u>(3) and character pairs are replaced.

       <b>status-right-length</b> <u>length</u>
               Set the maximum <u>length</u> of the right component of the status line.  The default is 40.

       <b>status-right-style</b> <u>style</u>
               Set  the  style of the right part of the status line.  For how to specify <u>style</u>, see the “STYLES”
               section.

       <b>status-style</b> <u>style</u>
               Set status line style.  For how to specify <u>style</u>, see the “STYLES” section.

       <b>update-environment[]</b> <u>variable</u>
               Set list of environment variables to be copied into the session environment when a new session is
               created or an existing session is attached.  Any variables  that  do  not  exist  in  the  source
               environment  are  set  to  be  removed  from  the  session environment (as if <b>-r</b> was given to the
               <b>set-environment</b> command).

       <b>visual-activity</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b> | <b>both</b>]
               If on, display a message instead of sending a bell when activity occurs in a window for which the
               <b>monitor-activity</b> window option is enabled.  If set to both, a bell and a message are produced.

       <b>visual-bell</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b> | <b>both</b>]
               If on, a message is shown on a bell in a window for  which  the  <b>monitor-bell</b>  window  option  is
               enabled  instead  of  it being passed through to the terminal (which normally makes a sound).  If
               set to both, a bell and a message are produced.  Also see the <b>bell-action</b> option.

       <b>visual-silence</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b> | <b>both</b>]
               If <b>monitor-silence</b> is enabled, prints a message after the interval has expired on a given  window
               instead of sending a bell.  If set to both, a bell and a message are produced.

       <b>word-separators</b> <u>string</u>
               Sets the session's conception of what characters are considered word separators, for the purposes
               of the next and previous word commands in copy mode.

       Available window options are:

       <b>aggressive-resize</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
               Aggressively  resize  the chosen window.  This means that <b>tmux</b> will resize the window to the size
               of the smallest or largest session (see the <b>window-size</b> option)  for  which  it  is  the  current
               window,  rather than the session to which it is attached.  The window may resize when the current
               window is changed on another session; this option is good for full-screen programs which  support
               SIGWINCH and poor for interactive programs such as shells.

       <b>automatic-rename</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
               Control  automatic  window  renaming.   When this setting is enabled, <b>tmux</b> will rename the window
               automatically using the format specified by <b>automatic-rename-format</b>.  This flag is  automatically
               disabled  for  an  individual  window  when  a  name  is specified at creation with <b>new-window</b> or
               <b>new-session</b>, or later with <b>rename-window</b>, or with a terminal escape sequence.  It may be switched
               off globally with:

                     set-option -wg automatic-rename off

       <b>automatic-rename-format</b> <u>format</u>

       <b>main-pane-width</b> <u>width</u>
               Set  the  width  or  height  of  the  main  (left  or   top)   pane   in   the   <b>main-horizontal</b>,
               <b>main-horizontal-mirrored</b>,  <b>main-vertical</b>, or <b>main-vertical-mirrored</b> layouts.  If suffixed by ‘%’,
               this is a percentage of the window size.

       <b>copy-mode-match-style</b> <u>style</u>
               Set the style of search matches in copy mode.   For  how  to  specify  <u>style</u>,  see  the  “STYLES”
               section.

       <b>copy-mode-mark-style</b> <u>style</u>
               Set  the  style  of the line containing the mark in copy mode.  For how to specify <u>style</u>, see the
               “STYLES” section.

       <b>copy-mode-current-match-style</b> <u>style</u>

               “STYLES” section.

       <b>mode-keys</b> [<b>vi</b> | <b>emacs</b>]
               Use  vi  or emacs-style key bindings in copy mode.  The default is emacs, unless VISUAL or EDITOR
               contains ‘vi’.

       <b>mode-style</b> <u>style</u>
               Set window modes style.  For how to specify <u>style</u>, see the “STYLES” section.

       <b>monitor-activity</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]

       <b>monitor-silence</b> [<b>interval</b>]
               Monitor for silence (no activity) in the window within <b>interval</b> seconds.  Windows that have  been
               silent  for  the  interval  are highlighted in the status line.  An interval of zero disables the
               monitoring.

       <b>other-pane-height</b> <u>height</u>
               Set  the  height  of  the  other  panes  (not  the  main  pane)  in   the   <b>main-horizontal</b>   and
               <b>main-horizontal-mirrored</b>  layouts.   If  this  option  is set to 0 (the default), it will have no
               effect.  If both the <b>main-pane-height</b> and <b>other-pane-height</b> options are set, the main  pane  will
               grow  taller  to  make  the other panes the specified height, but will never shrink to do so.  If
               suffixed by ‘%’, this is a percentage of the window size.

       <b>other-pane-width</b> <u>width</u>
               Like  <b>other-pane-height</b>,  but  set  the  width  of  other  panes   in   the   <b>main-vertical</b>   and

       <b>pane-border-format</b> <u>format</u>
               Set the text shown in pane border status lines.

       <b>pane-border-indicators</b> [<b>off</b> | <b>colour</b> | <b>arrows</b> | <b>both</b>]
               Indicate active pane by colouring only half of the border in windows with exactly two  panes,  by
               displaying arrow markers, by drawing both or neither.

       <b>pane-border-lines</b> <u>type</u>
               Set the type of characters used for drawing pane borders.  <u>type</u> may be one of:

               single  single lines using ACS or UTF-8 characters

               Set status line style for windows with a bell alert.  For how to specify <u>style</u>, see the  “STYLES”
               section.

       <b>window-status-current-format</b> <u>string</u>
               Like <u>window-status-format</u>, but is the format used when the window is the current window.

       <b>window-status-current-style</b> <u>style</u>
               Set  status  line  style  for  the  currently  active  window.  For how to specify <u>style</u>, see the
               “STYLES” section.

       <b>window-status-format</b> <u>string</u>
               Set the format in which the window is  displayed  in  the  status  line  window  list.   See  the
               “FORMATS” and “STYLES” sections.

       <b>window-status-last-style</b> <u>style</u>
               Set  status  line  style  for the last active window.  For how to specify <u>style</u>, see the “STYLES”
               section.

       <b>window-status-separator</b> <u>string</u>
               Sets the separator drawn between windows in the status line.   The  default  is  a  single  space
               character.

       <b>window-status-style</b> <u>style</u>
               Set status line style for a single window.  For how to specify <u>style</u>, see the “STYLES” section.

       <b>window-size</b> <u>largest</u> | <u>smallest</u> | <u>manual</u> | <u>latest</u>
               Configure  how  <b>tmux</b>  determines  the  window  size.   If set to <u>largest</u>, the size of the largest
               attached session is used; if <u>smallest</u>, the size of the smallest.  If <u>manual</u>, the size  of  a  new
               window  is  set from the <b>default-size</b> option and windows are resized automatically.  With <u>latest</u>,
               <b>tmux</b> uses the size of the client that had the most recent activity.  See also  the  <b>resize-window</b>
               command and the <b>aggressive-resize</b> option.

       <b>wrap-search</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
               If  this  option  is set, searches will wrap around the end of the pane contents.  The default is
               on.

       Available pane options are:

       <b>allow-passthrough</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b> | <b>all</b>]
               Allow programs in the pane to bypass <b>tmux</b> using a terminal escape sequence (\ePtmux;...\e\\).  If
               set to <b>on</b>, passthrough sequences will be allowed only if the pane is visible.   If  set  to  <b>all</b>,
               they will be allowed even if the pane is invisible.

       <b>allow-rename</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
               Allow  programs  in  the  pane  to  change  the  window  name  using  a  terminal escape sequence
               (\ek...\e\\).

       <b>allow-set-title</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
               Allow programs in the pane to change the title using the terminal escape sequences  (\e]2;...\e\\
               or \e]0;...\e\\).

       <b>alternate-screen</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
               This  option  configures  whether programs running inside the pane may use the terminal alternate
               screen feature, which allows the <u>smcup</u> and <u>rmcup</u> <u><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></u>(5) capabilities.  The alternate  screen
               feature  preserves the contents of the window when an interactive application starts and restores
               it on exit, so that any output visible before the application starts reappears unchanged after it
               exits.

       <b>cursor-colour</b> <u>colour</u>
               Set the colour of the cursor.

       <b>pane-colours[]</b> <u>colour</u>
               The default colour palette.  Each entry in the array defines the colour <b>tmux</b> uses when the colour
               with that index is requested.  The index may be from zero to 255.

       <b>cursor-style</b> <u>style</u>
               Set  the  style  of  the  cursor.   Available  styles  are:   <b>default</b>,   <b>blinking-block</b>,   <b>block</b>,
               <b>blinking-underline</b>, <b>underline</b>, <b>blinking-bar</b>, <b>bar</b>.

       <b>remain-on-exit</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b> | <b>failed</b>]
               A  pane  with  this  flag  set  is not destroyed when the program running in it exits.  If set to
               <b>failed</b>, then only when the program exit status is not zero.  The pane may be reactivated with the
               <b>respawn-pane</b> command.

       <b>remain-on-exit-format</b> <u>string</u>
               Set the text shown at the bottom of exited panes when <b>remain-on-exit</b> is enabled.

       <b>scroll-on-clear</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
               When the entire screen is cleared and this option is on, scroll the contents of the  screen  into
               history before clearing it.

       <b>synchronize-panes</b> [<b>on</b> | <b>off</b>]
               Duplicate  input  to  all  other  panes in the same window where this option is also on (only for
               panes that are not in any mode).

       <b>window-active-style</b> <u>style</u>
               Set the pane style when it is the active pane.  For  how  to  specify  <u>style</u>,  see  the  “STYLES”
               section.

       <b>window-style</b> <u>style</u>
               Set the pane style.  For how to specify <u>style</u>, see the “STYLES” section.

</pre><h4><b>HOOKS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tmux</b> allows commands to run on various triggers, called <u>hooks</u>.  Most <b>tmux</b> commands have an <u>after</u> hook and
       there are a number of hooks not associated with commands.

       Hooks are stored as array options, members of the array are executed in order when the hook is triggered.
       Like  options  different  hooks  may  be  global  or  belong  to a session, window or pane.  Hooks may be
       configured with the <b>set-hook</b> or <b>set-option</b> commands and displayed with  <b>show-hooks</b>  or  <b>show-options</b>  <b>-H</b>.
       The following two commands are equivalent:

              set-hook -g pane-mode-changed[42] 'set -g status-left-style bg=red'
              set-option -g pane-mode-changed[42] 'set -g status-left-style bg=red'

       Setting a hook without specifying an array index clears the hook and sets the first member of the array.

       A  command's  after  hook  is  run  after  it completes, except when the command is run as part of a hook
       itself.  They are named with an ‘after-’ prefix.  For example, the  following  command  adds  a  hook  to
       select the even-vertical layout after every <b>split-window</b>:

             set-hook -g after-split-window "selectl even-vertical"

       If  a command fails, the ‘command-error’ hook will be fired.  For example, this could be used to write to
       a log file:

             set-hook -g command-error "run-shell \"echo 'a tmux command failed' &gt;&gt;/tmp/log\""

       All the notifications listed in the “CONTROL MODE” section are  hooks  (without  any  arguments),  except
       <b>%exit</b>.  The following additional hooks are available:

       alert-activity          Run when a window has activity.  See <b>monitor-activity</b>.

       alert-bell              Run when a window has received a bell.  See <b>monitor-bell</b>.

       alert-silence           Run when a window has been silent.  See <b>monitor-silence</b>.

       client-active           Run when a client becomes the latest active client of its session.

       client-attached         Run when a client is attached.

       client-detached         Run when a client is detached

       client-focus-in         Run when focus enters a client

       client-focus-out        Run when focus exits a client

       client-resized          Run when a client is resized.

       client-session-changed  Run when a client's attached session is changed.

       command-error           Run when a command fails.

       pane-died               Run  when  the  program  running in a pane exits, but <b>remain-on-exit</b> is on so the
                               pane has not closed.

       pane-exited             Run when the program running in a pane exits.

       pane-focus-in           Run when the focus enters a pane, if the <b>focus-events</b> option is on.

       pane-focus-out          Run when the focus exits a pane, if the <b>focus-events</b> option is on.

       pane-set-clipboard      Run when the terminal clipboard is set using the <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1) escape sequence.

       session-created         Run when a new session created.

       session-closed          Run when a session closed.

       session-renamed         Run when a session is renamed.

       window-linked           Run when a window is linked into a session.

       window-renamed          Run when a window is renamed.

       window-resized          Run when a window is resized.  This may be after the <u>client-resized</u> hook is run.

       window-unlinked         Run when a window is unlinked from a session.

       Hooks are managed with these commands:

       <b>set-hook</b> [<b>-agpRuw</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>] <u>hook-name</u> <u>command</u>
               Without <b>-R</b>, sets (or with <b>-u</b> unsets) hook <u>hook-name</u> to <u>command</u>.  The flags are the  same  as  for
               <b>set-option</b>.

               With <b>-R</b>, run <u>hook-name</u> immediately.

       <b>show-hooks</b> [<b>-gpw</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>]
               Shows hooks.  The flags are the same as for <b>show-options</b>.

</pre><h4><b>MOUSE</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       If  the  <b>mouse</b> option is on (the default is off), <b>tmux</b> allows mouse events to be bound as keys.  The name
       of each key is made up of a mouse event (such as ‘MouseUp1’) and a location suffix, one of the following:

             <b>Pane</b>             the contents of a pane
             <b>Border</b>           a pane border
             <b>Status</b>           the status line window list
             <b>StatusLeft</b>       the left part of the status line
             <b>StatusRight</b>      the right part of the status line
             <b>StatusDefault</b>    any other part of the status line

       The following mouse events are available:

             <b>WheelUp</b>       WheelDown
             <b>MouseDown1</b>    MouseUp1      MouseDrag1   MouseDragEnd1
             <b>MouseDown2</b>    MouseUp2      MouseDrag2   MouseDragEnd2
             <b>MouseDown3</b>    MouseUp3      MouseDrag3   MouseDragEnd3
             <b>SecondClick1</b>  SecondClick2  SecondClick3
             <b>DoubleClick1</b>  DoubleClick2  DoubleClick3
             <b>TripleClick1</b>  TripleClick2  TripleClick3

       The ‘SecondClick’ events are fired for the second click of a double click, even if there may be  a  third
       click which will fire ‘TripleClick’ instead of ‘DoubleClick’.

       Each should be suffixed with a location, for example ‘MouseDown1Status’.

       The special token ‘{mouse}’ or ‘=’ may be used as <u>target-window</u> or <u>target-pane</u> in commands bound to mouse
       key  bindings.  It resolves to the window or pane over which the mouse event took place (for example, the
       window in the status line over which button 1 was released for a ‘MouseUp1Status’ binding,  or  the  pane
       over which the wheel was scrolled for a ‘WheelDownPane’ binding).

       The <b>send-keys</b> <b>-M</b> flag may be used to forward a mouse event to a pane.

       The  default  key  bindings  allow  the  mouse to be used to select and resize panes, to copy text and to
       change window using the status line.  These take effect if the <b>mouse</b> option is turned on.

</pre><h4><b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       Certain commands accept the <b>-F</b> flag with a <u>format</u> argument.  This is a string which controls  the  output
       format  of  the  command.   Format variables are enclosed in ‘#{’ and ‘}’, for example ‘#{session_name}’.
       The possible variables are listed in the table below, or the name of a <b>tmux</b> option may  be  used  for  an
       option's value.  Some variables have a shorter alias such as ‘#S’; ‘##’ is replaced by a single ‘#’, ‘#,’
       by a ‘,’ and ‘#}’ by a ‘}’.

       Conditionals  are  available  by  prefixing with ‘?’ and separating two alternatives with a comma; if the
       specified variable exists and is not zero, the first alternative is chosen, otherwise the second is used.
       For example ‘#{?session_attached,attached,not attached}’  will  include  the  string  ‘attached’  if  the
       session  is  attached and the string ‘not attached’ if it is unattached, or ‘#{?automatic-rename,yes,no}’
       will include ‘yes’ if  <b>automatic-rename</b>  is  enabled,  or  ‘no’  if  not.   Conditionals  can  be  nested
       arbitrarily.  Inside a conditional, ‘,’ and ‘}’ must be escaped as ‘#,’ and ‘#}’, unless they are part of
       a ‘#{...}’ replacement.  For example:

             #{?pane_in_mode,#[fg=white#,bg=red],#[fg=red#,bg=white]}#W .

       String  comparisons  may  be  expressed by prefixing two comma-separated alternatives by ‘==’, ‘!=’, ‘&lt;’,
       ‘&gt;’, ‘&lt;=’ or ‘&gt;=’ and a colon.  For example ‘#{==:#{host},myhost}’ will be replaced by ‘1’ if running  on
       ‘myhost’,  otherwise  by  ‘0’.   ‘||’  and ‘&amp;&amp;’ evaluate to true if either or both of two comma-separated
       alternatives are true, for example ‘#{||:#{pane_in_mode},#{alternate_on}}’.

       An ‘m’ specifies an <u><a href="../man3/fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch</a></u>(3) or regular expression comparison.  The first argument is the  pattern  and
       the  second  the  string  to  compare.   An optional argument specifies flags: ‘r’ means the pattern is a
       regular expression instead of the default <u><a href="../man3/fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch</a></u>(3) pattern, and ‘i’ means to ignore case.  For example:
       ‘#{m:*foo*,#{host}}’ or ‘#{m/ri:^A,MYVAR}’.  A ‘C’ performs a search for an <u><a href="../man3/fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch</a></u>(3) pattern or regular
       expression in the pane content and evaluates to zero if not found, or a line number if found.  Like  ‘m’,
       an ‘r’ flag means search for a regular expression and ‘i’ ignores case.  For example: ‘#{C/r:^Start}’

       Numeric  operators  may  be  performed  by  prefixing two comma-separated alternatives with an ‘e’ and an
       operator.  An optional ‘f’ flag may be given after the operator to use floating point numbers,  otherwise
       integers  are  used.  This may be followed by a number giving the number of decimal places to use for the
       result.  The available operators are: addition ‘+’, subtraction ‘-’, multiplication  ‘*’,  division  ‘/’,
       modulus  ‘m’  or  ‘%’  (note  that  ‘%’  must  be  escaped  as ‘%%’ in formats which are also expanded by
       <u><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a></u>(3)) and numeric comparison operators  ‘==’,  ‘!=’,  ‘&lt;’,  ‘&lt;=’,  ‘&gt;’  and  ‘&gt;=’.   For  example,
       ‘#{e|*|f|4:5.5,3}’  multiplies  5.5  by 3 for a result with four decimal places and ‘#{e|%%:7,3}’ returns
       the modulus of 7 and 3.  ‘a’ replaces a numeric argument by its ASCII equivalent, so ‘#{a:98}’ results in
       ‘b’.  ‘c’ replaces a <b>tmux</b> colour by its six-digit hexadecimal RGB value.

       A limit may be placed on the length of the resultant string by prefixing it by an ‘=’,  a  number  and  a
       colon.    Positive  numbers  count  from  the  start  of  the  string  and  negative  from  the  end,  so
       ‘#{=5:pane_title}’  will  include  at  most  the  first  five  characters   of   the   pane   title,   or
       ‘#{=-5:pane_title}’  the last five characters.  A suffix or prefix may be given as a second argument - if
       provided then it is appended or prepended to the string if the  length  has  been  trimmed,  for  example
       ‘#{=/5/...:pane_title}’ will append ‘...’ if the pane title is more than five characters.  Similarly, ‘p’
       pads  the  string to a given width, for example ‘#{p10:pane_title}’ will result in a width of at least 10
       characters.  A positive width pads on the left, a negative on the right.  ‘n’ expands to  the  length  of
       the variable and ‘w’ to its width when displayed, for example ‘#{n:window_name}’.

       Prefixing  a  time  variable  with  ‘t:’  will  convert  it to a string, so if ‘#{window_activity}’ gives
       ‘1445765102’, ‘#{t:window_activity}’ gives ‘Sun Oct 25 09:25:02 2015’.  Adding ‘p (’  ‘`t/p`’)  will  use
       shorter  but  less accurate time format for times in the past.  A custom format may be given using an ‘f’
       suffix (note that ‘%’ must be  escaped  as  ‘%%’  if  the  format  is  separately  being  passed  through
       <u><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a></u>(3), for example in the <b>status-left</b> option): ‘#{t/f/%%H#:%%M:window_activity}’, see <u><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a></u>(3).

       The ‘b:’ and ‘d:’ prefixes are <u><a href="../man3/basename.3.html">basename</a></u>(3) and <u><a href="../man3/dirname.3.html">dirname</a></u>(3) of the variable respectively.  ‘q:’ will escape
       <u><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></u>(1)  special  characters or with a ‘h’ suffix, escape hash characters (so ‘#’ becomes ‘##’).  ‘E:’ will
       expand the format twice, for example ‘#{E:status-left}’ is the result of expanding  the  content  of  the
       <b>status-left</b>  option  rather  than  the  option  itself.   ‘T:’  is like ‘E:’ but also expands <u><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a></u>(3)
       specifiers.  ‘S:’, ‘W:’, ‘P:’ or ‘L:’ will loop over each session, window, pane or client and insert  the
       format  once  for  each.   For windows and panes, two comma-separated formats may be given: the second is
       used for the current window or active pane.  For example, to get a list of  windows  formatted  like  the
       status line:

             #{W:#{E:window-status-format} ,#{E:window-status-current-format} }

       ‘N:’  checks  if  a window (without any suffix or with the ‘w’ suffix) or a session (with the ‘s’ suffix)
       name exists, for example ‘`N/w:foo`’ is replaced with 1 if a window named ‘foo’ exists.

       A prefix of the form ‘s/foo/bar/:’ will substitute ‘foo’ with ‘bar’ throughout.  The first  argument  may
       be  an  extended  regular  expression  and  a  final  argument  may  be  ‘i’  to ignore case, for example
       ‘s/a(.)/\1x/i:’ would change ‘abABab’ into ‘bxBxbx’.  A different delimiter character may also  be  used,
       to  avoid  collisions  with literal slashes in the pattern.  For example, ‘s|foo/|bar/|:’ will substitute
       ‘foo/’ with ‘bar/’ throughout.

       In addition, the last line of a shell command's  output  may  be  inserted  using  ‘#()’.   For  example,
       ‘#(uptime)’  will  insert  the  system's uptime.  When constructing formats, <b>tmux</b> does not wait for ‘#()’
       commands to finish; instead, the previous result from running the same command is used, or a  placeholder
       if  the  command  has  not been run before.  If the command hasn't exited, the most recent line of output
       will be used, but the status line will not be updated more than once a  second.   Commands  are  executed
       using  <u><a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a></u>  and  with  the  <b>tmux</b>  global  environment  set  (see the “GLOBAL AND SESSION ENVIRONMENT”
       section).

       An ‘l’ specifies  that  a  string  should  be  interpreted  literally  and  not  expanded.   For  example
       ‘#{l:#{?pane_in_mode,yes,no}}’ will be replaced by ‘#{?pane_in_mode,yes,no}’.

       The following variables are available, where appropriate:

       <b>Variable</b> <b>name</b>          <b>Alias</b>    <b>Replaced</b> <b>with</b>
       <b>active_window_index</b>             Index of active window in session
       <b>alternate_on</b>                    1 if pane is in alternate screen
       <b>alternate_saved_x</b>               Saved cursor X in alternate screen
       <b>alternate_saved_y</b>               Saved cursor Y in alternate screen
       <b>buffer_created</b>                  Time buffer created
       <b>buffer_name</b>                     Name of buffer
       <b>buffer_sample</b>                   Sample of start of buffer
       <b>buffer_size</b>                     Size of the specified buffer in bytes

</pre><h4><b>STYLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tmux</b> offers various options to specify the colour and attributes of aspects of the interface, for example
       <b>status-style</b>  for the status line.  In addition, embedded styles may be specified in format options, such
       as <b>status-left</b>, by enclosing them in ‘#[’ and ‘]’.

       A style may be the single term ‘default’ to specify the default style (which may come from an option, for
       example <b>status-style</b> in the status line) or a space or comma separated list of the following:

       <b>fg=colour</b>
               Set the foreground colour.  The colour is one of: <b>black</b>, <b>red</b>, <b>green</b>, <b>yellow</b>, <b>blue</b>, <b>magenta</b>, <b>cyan</b>,
               <b>white</b>; if  supported  the  bright  variants  <b>brightred</b>,  <b>brightgreen</b>,  <b>brightyellow</b>;  <b>colour0</b>  to
               <b>colour255</b>  from  the  256-colour  set;  <b>default</b> for the default colour; <b>terminal</b> for the terminal
               default colour; or a hexadecimal RGB string such as ‘#ffffff’.

       <b>bg=colour</b>
               Set the background colour.

       <b>us=colour</b>
               Set the underscore colour.

       <b>none</b>    Set no attributes (turn off any active attributes).

       <b>acs</b>, <b>bright</b> (or <b>bold</b>),  <b>dim</b>,  <b>underscore</b>,  <b>blink</b>,  <b>reverse</b>,  <b>hidden</b>,  <b>italics</b>,  <b>overline</b>,  <b>strikethrough</b>,
               <b>double-underscore</b>, <b>curly-underscore</b>, <b>dotted-underscore</b>, <b>dashed-underscore</b>
               Set an attribute.  Any of the attributes may be prefixed with ‘no’ to unset.  <b>acs</b> is the terminal
               alternate character set.

       <b>align=left</b> (or <b>noalign</b>), <b>align=centre</b>, <b>align=right</b>
               Align text to the left, centre or right of the available space if appropriate.

       <b>fill=colour</b>
               Fill the available space with a background colour if appropriate.

       <b>list=on</b>, <b>list=focus</b>, <b>list=left-marker</b>, <b>list=right-marker</b>, <b>nolist</b>
               Mark  the  position  of  the  various window list components in the <b>status-format</b> option: <b>list=on</b>
               marks the start of the list; <b>list=focus</b> is the part of the list that should be kept in  focus  if
               the entire list won't fit in the available space (typically the current window); <b>list=left-marker</b>
               and  <b>list=right-marker</b>  mark the text to be used to mark that text has been trimmed from the left
               or right of the list if there is not enough space.

       <b>push-default</b>, <b>pop-default</b>
               Store the current colours and attributes as the default or reset  to  the  previous  default.   A
               <b>push-default</b>  affects  any  subsequent  use  of  the  <b>default</b> term until a <b>pop-default</b>.  Only one
               default may be pushed (each <b>push-default</b> replaces the previous saved default).

       <b>range=left</b>, <b>range=right</b>, <b>range=session|X</b>, <b>range=window|X</b>, <b>range=pane|X</b>, <b>range=user|X</b>, <b>norange</b>
               Mark a range for mouse events in the <b>status-format</b> option.  When a  mouse  event  occurs  in  the
               <b>range=left</b> or <b>range=right</b> range, the ‘StatusLeft’ and ‘StatusRight’ key bindings are triggered.

               <b>range=session|X</b>, <b>range=window|X</b> and <b>range=pane|X</b> are ranges for a session, window or pane.  These
               trigger the ‘Status’ mouse key with the target session, window or pane given by the ‘X’ argument.
               ‘X’  is  a  session  ID,  window  index  in  the  current  session  or a pane ID.  For these, the
               <b>mouse_status_range</b> format variable will be set to ‘session’, ‘window’ or ‘pane’.

               <b>range=user|X</b> is a user-defined range; it triggers the ‘Status’ mouse key.  The argument ‘X’  will
               be available in the <b>mouse_status_range</b> format variable.  ‘X’ must be at most 15 bytes in length.

       Examples are:

             fg=yellow bold underscore blink
             bg=black,fg=default,noreverse

</pre><h4><b>NAMES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>TITLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tmux</b>  distinguishes  between  names  and  titles.   Windows and sessions have names, which may be used to
       specify them in targets and are displayed in the status line and various lists:  the  name  is  the  <b>tmux</b>
       identifier  for  a  window  or  session.  Only panes have titles.  A pane's title is typically set by the
       program running inside the pane using an escape sequence (like it would set the <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1) window title  in
       <u><a href="../man7/X.7.html">X</a></u>(7)).   Windows  themselves do not have titles - a window's title is the title of its active pane.  <b>tmux</b>
       itself may set the title of the terminal in which the client is running, see the <b>set-titles</b> option.

       A session's name is set with the <b>new-session</b> and <b>rename-session</b> commands.  A window's name  is  set  with
       one of:

       1.      A command argument (such as <b>-n</b> for <b>new-window</b> or <b>new-session</b>).

       2.      An escape sequence (if the <b>allow-rename</b> option is turned on):

                     $ printf '\033kWINDOW_NAME\033\\'

       3.      Automatic  renaming,  which sets the name to the active command in the window's active pane.  See
               the <b>automatic-rename</b> option.

       When a pane is first created, its title is the hostname.  A pane's title can be set via the title setting
       escape sequence, for example:

             $ printf '\033]2;My Title\033\\'

       It can also be modified with the <b>select-pane</b> <b>-T</b> command.

</pre><h4><b>GLOBAL</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SESSION</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       When the server is started, <b>tmux</b> copies the environment into the <u>global</u> <u>environment</u>;  in  addition,  each
       session  has  a  <u>session</u>  <u>environment</u>.  When a window is created, the session and global environments are
       merged.  If a variable exists in both, the value from the session environment is used.  The result is the
       initial environment passed to the new process.

       The <b>update-environment</b> session option may be used to update the session environment from the client  when
       a  new  session  is  created  or  an  old  reattached.  <b>tmux</b> also initialises the TMUX variable with some
       internal information to allow commands to be executed from inside, and the TERM variable with the correct
       terminal setting of ‘screen’.

       Variables in both session and global environments may be marked as  hidden.   Hidden  variables  are  not
       passed  into the environment of new processes and instead can only be used by tmux itself (for example in
       formats, see the “FORMATS” section).

       Commands to alter and view the environment are:

       <b>set-environment</b> [<b>-Fhgru</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-session</u>] <u>name</u> [<u>value</u>]
                     (alias: <b>setenv</b>)
               Set or unset an environment variable.   If  <b>-g</b>  is  used,  the  change  is  made  in  the  global
               environment;  otherwise,  it  is applied to the session environment for <u>target-session</u>.  If <b>-F</b> is
               present, then <u>value</u> is expanded as a format.  The <b>-u</b> flag unsets a variable.   <b>-r</b>  indicates  the
               variable  is  to  be  removed  from  the environment before starting a new process.  <b>-h</b> marks the
               variable as hidden.

       <b>show-environment</b> [<b>-hgs</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-session</u>] [<u>variable</u>]
                     (alias: <b>showenv</b>)
               Display the environment for <u>target-session</u> or the global environment with  <b>-g</b>.   If  <u>variable</u>  is
               omitted,  all variables are shown.  Variables removed from the environment are prefixed with ‘-’.
               If <b>-s</b> is used, the output is formatted as a set  of  Bourne  shell  commands.   <b>-h</b>  shows  hidden
               variables (omitted by default).

</pre><h4><b>STATUS</b> <b>LINE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tmux</b> includes an optional status line which is displayed in the bottom line of each terminal.

       By  default, the status line is enabled and one line in height (it may be disabled or made multiple lines
       with the <b>status</b> session option) and contains, from left-to-right: the name  of  the  current  session  in
       square brackets; the window list; the title of the active pane in double quotes; and the time and date.

       Each  line  of the status line is configured with the <b>status-format</b> option.  The default is made of three
       parts: configurable left and right sections (which may contain dynamic content such as the time or output
       from a shell command, see the  <b>status-left</b>,  <b>status-left-length</b>,  <b>status-right</b>,  and  <b>status-right-length</b>
       options  below),  and  a  central window list.  By default, the window list shows the index, name and (if
       any) flag of the windows present in the  current  session  in  ascending  numerical  order.   It  may  be
       customised  with  the  <u>window-status-format</u> and <u>window-status-current-format</u> options.  The flag is one of
       the following symbols appended to the window name:

             <b>Symbol</b>    <b>Meaning</b>
             <b>*</b>         Denotes the current window.
             <b>-</b>         Marks the last window (previously selected).
             <b>#</b>         Window activity is monitored and activity has been detected.
             <b>!</b>         Window bells are monitored and a bell has occurred in the window.
             <b>~</b>         The window has been silent for the monitor-silence interval.
             <b>M</b>         The window contains the marked pane.
             <b>Z</b>         The window's active pane is zoomed.

       The # symbol relates to the <b>monitor-activity</b> window option.  The  window  name  is  printed  in  inverted
       colours if an alert (bell, activity or silence) is present.

       The  colour  and  attributes  of  the  status  line  may  be configured, the entire status line using the
       <b>status-style</b> session option and individual windows using the <b>window-status-style</b> window option.

       The status line is automatically refreshed at interval if it has changed, the interval may be  controlled
       with the <b>status-interval</b> session option.

       Commands related to the status line are as follows:

       <b>clear-prompt-history</b> [<b>-T</b> <u>prompt-type</u>]
                     (alias: <b>clearphist</b>)
               Clear  status  prompt  history for prompt type <u>prompt-type</u>.  If <b>-T</b> is omitted, then clear history
               for all types.  See <b>command-prompt</b> for possible values for <u>prompt-type</u>.

       <b>command-prompt</b> [<b>-1bFikN</b>] [<b>-I</b> <u>inputs</u>] [<b>-p</b> <u>prompts</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-client</u>] [<b>-T</b> <u>prompt-type</u>] [<u>template</u>]
               Open the command prompt in a client.  This may be used  from  inside  <b>tmux</b>  to  execute  commands
               interactively.

               If <u>template</u> is specified, it is used as the command.  With <b>-F</b>, <u>template</u> is expanded as a format.

               If  present,  <b>-I</b>  is a comma-separated list of the initial text for each prompt.  If <b>-p</b> is given,
               <u>prompts</u> is a comma-separated list of prompts which are displayed in  order;  otherwise  a  single
               prompt is displayed, constructed from <u>template</u> if it is present, or ‘:’ if not.

               Before  the  command  is executed, the first occurrence of the string ‘%%’ and all occurrences of
               ‘%1’ are replaced by the response to the first prompt, all ‘%2’ are replaced with the response to
               the second prompt, and so on for further prompts.  Up to nine prompt responses  may  be  replaced
               (‘%1’ to ‘%9’).  ‘%%%’ is like ‘%%’ but any quotation marks are escaped.

               <b>-1</b>  makes  the  prompt  only  accept  one key press, in this case the resulting input is a single
               character.  <b>-k</b> is like <b>-1</b> but the key press is translated to a key name.   <b>-N</b>  makes  the  prompt
               only  accept  numeric  key  presses.  <b>-i</b> executes the command every time the prompt input changes
               instead of when the user exits the command prompt.

               <b>-T</b> tells <b>tmux</b> the prompt type.  This affects what completions are offered when  <u>Tab</u>  is  pressed.
               Available types are: ‘command’, ‘search’, ‘target’ and ‘window-target’.

               The  following  keys  have a special meaning in the command prompt, depending on the value of the
               <b>status-keys</b> option:

                     <b>Function</b>                             <b>vi</b>        <b>emacs</b>
                     <b>Cancel</b> <b>command</b> <b>prompt</b>                q         Escape

                     <b>Move</b> <b>cursor</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b>                   $         C-e
                     <b>Move</b> <b>cursor</b> <b>to</b> <b>next</b> <b>word</b>             w         M-f
                     <b>Move</b> <b>cursor</b> <b>to</b> <b>previous</b> <b>word</b>         b         M-b
                     <b>Move</b> <b>cursor</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b>                 0         C-a
                     <b>Transpose</b> <b>characters</b>                           C-t

               With <b>-b</b>, the prompt is shown in the background and the invoking client does not exit until it  is
               dismissed.

       <b>confirm-before</b> [<b>-by</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>confirm-key</u>] [<b>-p</b> <u>prompt</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-client</u>] <u>command</u>
                     (alias: <b>confirm</b>)
               Ask  for confirmation before executing <u>command</u>.  If <b>-p</b> is given, <u>prompt</u> is the prompt to display;
               otherwise a prompt is constructed from <u>command</u>.  It may contain the special  character  sequences
               supported  by  the  <b>status-left</b>  option.   With <b>-b</b>, the prompt is shown in the background and the
               invoking client does not exit until it is dismissed.  <b>-y</b> changes the default behaviour (if  Enter
               alone  is  pressed)  of  the  prompt  to  run  the  command.   <b>-c</b> changes the confirmation key to
               <u>confirm-key</u>; the default is ‘y’.

       <b>display-menu</b> [<b>-OM</b>] [<b>-b</b> <u>border-lines</u>] [<b>-c</b> <u>target-client</u>]  [<b>-C</b>  <u>starting-choice</u>]  [<b>-H</b>  <u>selected-style</u>]  [<b>-s</b>

               [<u>argument</u> <u>...</u>]
                     (alias: <b>menu</b>)
               Display  a  menu  on  <u>target-client</u>.   <u>target-pane</u> gives the target for any commands run from the
               menu.

               A menu is passed as a series of arguments: first the menu item name, second the key shortcut  (or
               empty  for none) and third the command to run when the menu item is chosen.  The name and command
               are formats, see the “FORMATS” and “STYLES” sections.  If the name begins with a hyphen (-), then
               the item is disabled (shown dim) and may not be chosen.  The name may be empty  for  a  separator
               line, in which case both the key and command should be omitted.

               <b>-b</b>  sets  the  type  of  characters  used  for  drawing menu borders.  See <b>popup-border-lines</b> for
               possible values for <u>border-lines</u>.

               <b>-H</b> sets the style for the selected menu item (see “STYLES”).

               <b>-s</b> sets the style for the menu and <b>-S</b> sets the style for the menu border (see “STYLES”).

               <b>-T</b> is a format for the menu title (see “FORMATS”).

               <b>-C</b> sets the menu item selected by default, if the menu is not bound to a mouse key binding.

               <b>-x</b> and <b>-y</b> give the position of the menu.  Both may be a row or  column  number,  or  one  of  the
               following special values:

                     <b>Value</b>    <b>Flag</b>    <b>Meaning</b>
                     <b>C</b>        Both    The centre of the terminal
                     <b>R</b>        <b>-x</b>      The right side of the terminal
                     <b>P</b>        Both    The bottom left of the pane
                     <b>M</b>        Both    The mouse position
                     <b>W</b>        Both    The window position on the status line
                     <b>S</b>        <b>-y</b>      The line above or below the status line

               Or a format, which is expanded including the following additional variables:

                     <b>Variable</b> <b>name</b>                 <b>Replaced</b> <b>with</b>
                     <b>popup_centre_x</b>                Centered in the client
                     <b>popup_centre_y</b>                Centered in the client
                     <b>popup_height</b>                  Height of menu or popup
                     <b>popup_mouse_bottom</b>            Bottom of at the mouse
                     <b>popup_mouse_centre_x</b>          Horizontal centre at the mouse

                     <b>popup_pane_bottom</b>             Bottom of the pane
                     <b>popup_pane_left</b>               Left of the pane
                     <b>popup_pane_right</b>              Right of the pane
                     <b>popup_pane_top</b>                Top of the pane
                     <b>popup_status_line_y</b>           Above or below the status line
                     <b>popup_width</b>                   Width of menu or popup
                     <b>popup_window_status_line_x</b>    At the window position in status line
                     <b>popup_window_status_line_y</b>    At the status line showing the window

               Each  menu  consists  of  items followed by a key shortcut shown in brackets.  If the menu is too
               large to fit on the terminal, it is  not  displayed.   Pressing  the  key  shortcut  chooses  the
               corresponding  item.   If  the  mouse is enabled and the menu is opened from a mouse key binding,
               releasing the mouse button with an item selected chooses that item and releasing the mouse button
               without an item selected closes the menu.  <b>-O</b> changes this behaviour so that the  menu  does  not
               close  when  the  mouse  button is released without an item selected the menu is not closed and a
               mouse button must be clicked to choose an item.

               <b>-M</b> tells <b>tmux</b> the menu should handle mouse events; by default only menus opened  from  mouse  key
               bindings do so.

               The following keys are available in menus:

                     <b>Key</b>    <b>Function</b>
                     <b>Enter</b>  Choose selected item
                     <b>Up</b>     Select previous item
                     <b>Down</b>   Select next item
                     <b>q</b>      Exit menu

       <b>display-message</b> [<b>-aIlNpv</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>target-client</u>] [<b>-d</b> <u>delay</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>] [<u>message</u>]
                     (alias: <b>display</b>)
               Display a message.  If <b>-p</b> is given, the output is printed to stdout, otherwise it is displayed in
               the  <u>target-client</u>  status  line  for  up  to  <u>delay</u>  milliseconds.   If  <u>delay</u> is not given, the
               <b>display-time</b> option is used; a delay of zero waits for a key press.  ‘N’ ignores key presses  and
               closes  only  after the delay expires.  If <b>-l</b> is given, <u>message</u> is printed unchanged.  Otherwise,
               the format of  <u>message</u>  is  described  in  the  “FORMATS”  section;  information  is  taken  from
               <u>target-pane</u> if <b>-t</b> is given, otherwise the active pane.

               <b>-v</b>  prints  verbose  logging  as the format is parsed and <b>-a</b> lists the format variables and their
               values.

               <b>-I</b> forwards any input read from stdin to the empty pane given by <u>target-pane</u>.

       <b>display-popup</b> [<b>-BCE</b>] [<b>-b</b> <u>border-lines</u>] [<b>-c</b>  <u>target-client</u>]  [<b>-d</b>  <u>start-directory</u>]  [<b>-e</b>  <u>environment</u>]  [<b>-h</b>

               <u>position</u>] [<u>shell-command</u>]
                     (alias: <b>popup</b>)
               Display a popup running <u>shell-command</u> on <u>target-client</u>.  A popup is a rectangular box drawn  over
               the top of any panes.  Panes are not updated while a popup is present.

               <b>-E</b>  closes  the  popup  automatically  when <u>shell-command</u> exits.  Two <b>-E</b> closes the popup only if
               <u>shell-command</u> exited with success.

               <b>-x</b> and <b>-y</b> give the position of the popup, they have the same  meaning  as  for  the  <b>display-menu</b>
               command.   <b>-w</b>  and <b>-h</b> give the width and height - both may be a percentage (followed by ‘%’).  If
               omitted, half of the terminal size is used.

               <b>-B</b> does not surround the popup by a border.

               <b>-b</b> sets the type of characters used for drawing popup borders.  When  <b>-B</b>  is  specified,  the  <b>-b</b>
               option is ignored.  See <b>popup-border-lines</b> for possible values for <u>border-lines</u>.

               <b>-s</b> sets the style for the popup and <b>-S</b> sets the style for the popup border (see “STYLES”).

               <b>-e</b>  takes  the  form  ‘VARIABLE=value’  and sets an environment variable for the popup; it may be
               specified multiple times.

               <b>-T</b> is a format for the popup title (see “FORMATS”).

               The <b>-C</b> flag closes any popup on the client.

       <b>show-prompt-history</b> [<b>-T</b> <u>prompt-type</u>]
                     (alias: <b>showphist</b>)
               Display status prompt history for prompt type <u>prompt-type</u>.  If <b>-T</b> is omitted, then  show  history
               for all types.  See <b>command-prompt</b> for possible values for <u>prompt-type</u>.

</pre><h4><b>BUFFERS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tmux</b>  maintains  a  set  of  named  <u>paste</u> <u>buffers</u>.  Each buffer may be either explicitly or automatically
       named.  Explicitly named buffers are named when created with the <b>set-buffer</b> or <b>load-buffer</b>  commands,  or
       by  renaming  an  automatically named buffer with <b>set-buffer</b> <b>-n</b>.  Automatically named buffers are given a
       name such as ‘buffer0001’, ‘buffer0002’ and so on.  When the <b>buffer-limit</b> option is reached,  the  oldest
       automatically  named buffer is deleted.  Explicitly named buffers are not subject to <b>buffer-limit</b> and may
       be deleted with the <b>delete-buffer</b> command.

       Buffers may be added using <b>copy-mode</b> or the <b>set-buffer</b> and <b>load-buffer</b> commands, and pasted into a window
       using the <b>paste-buffer</b> command.  If a buffer command is  used  and  no  buffer  is  specified,  the  most
       recently added automatically named buffer is assumed.

       A configurable history buffer is also maintained for each window.  By default, up to 2000 lines are kept;
       this can be altered with the <b>history-limit</b> option (see the <b>set-option</b> command above).

       The buffer commands are as follows:

       <b>choose-buffer</b> [<b>-NZr</b>] [<b>-F</b> <u>format</u>] [<b>-f</b> <u>filter</u>] [<b>-K</b> <u>key-format</u>] [<b>-O</b> <u>sort-order</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>] [<u>template</u>]
               Put a pane into buffer mode, where a buffer may be chosen interactively from a list.  Each buffer
               is  shown  on  one  line.  A shortcut key is shown on the left in brackets allowing for immediate
               choice, or the list may be navigated and an item chosen or otherwise manipulated using  the  keys
               below.  <b>-Z</b> zooms the pane.  The following keys may be used in buffer mode:

                     <b>Key</b>    <b>Function</b>
                     <b>Enter</b>  Paste selected buffer
                     <b>Up</b>     Select previous buffer
                     <b>Down</b>   Select next buffer
                     <b>C-s</b>    Search by name or content
                     <b>n</b>      Repeat last search forwards
                     <b>N</b>      Repeat last search backwards
                     <b>t</b>      Toggle if buffer is tagged
                     <b>T</b>      Tag no buffers
                     <b>C-t</b>    Tag all buffers
                     <b>p</b>      Paste selected buffer
                     <b>P</b>      Paste tagged buffers
                     <b>d</b>      Delete selected buffer
                     <b>D</b>      Delete tagged buffers
                     <b>e</b>      Open the buffer in an editor
                     <b>f</b>      Enter a format to filter items
                     <b>O</b>      Change sort field
                     <b>r</b>      Reverse sort order
                     <b>v</b>      Toggle preview
                     <b>q</b>      Exit mode

               After a buffer is chosen, ‘%%’ is replaced by the buffer name in <u>template</u> and the result executed
               as a command.  If <u>template</u> is not given, "paste-buffer -p -b '%%'" is used.

               <b>-O</b> specifies the initial sort field: one of ‘time’ (creation), ‘name’ or ‘size’.  <b>-r</b> reverses the
               sort  order.   <b>-f</b>  specifies an initial filter: the filter is a format - if it evaluates to zero,
               the item in the list is not shown, otherwise it is shown.  If a filter would  lead  to  an  empty
               list,  it is ignored.  <b>-F</b> specifies the format for each item in the list and <b>-K</b> a format for each
               shortcut key; both are evaluated once for each  line.   <b>-N</b>  starts  without  the  preview.   This
               command works only if at least one client is attached.

       <b>clear-history</b> [<b>-H</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>]
                     (alias: <b>clearhist</b>)
               Remove and free the history for the specified pane.  <b>-H</b> also removes all hyperlinks.

       <b>delete-buffer</b> [<b>-b</b> <u>buffer-name</u>]
                     (alias: <b>deleteb</b>)
               Delete the buffer named <u>buffer-name</u>, or the most recently added automatically named buffer if not
               specified.

       <b>list-buffers</b> [<b>-F</b> <u>format</u>] [<b>-f</b> <u>filter</u>]
                     (alias: <b>lsb</b>)
               List the global buffers.  <b>-F</b> specifies the format of each line and <b>-f</b> a filter.  Only buffers for
               which the filter is true are shown.  See the “FORMATS” section.

       <b>load-buffer</b> [<b>-w</b>] [<b>-b</b> <u>buffer-name</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-client</u>] <u>path</u>
                     (alias: <b>loadb</b>)
               Load  the  contents  of the specified paste buffer from <u>path</u>.  If <b>-w</b> is given, the buffer is also
               sent to the clipboard for <u>target-client</u> using the <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1) escape sequence, if possible.  If <u>path</u>
               is ‘-’, the contents are read from stdin.

       <b>paste-buffer</b> [<b>-dpr</b>] [<b>-b</b> <u>buffer-name</u>] [<b>-s</b> <u>separator</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>]
                     (alias: <b>pasteb</b>)
               Insert the contents of a paste buffer into the specified pane.  If not specified, paste into  the
               current  one.   With <b>-d</b>, also delete the paste buffer.  When output, any linefeed (LF) characters
               in the paste buffer are replaced with a separator, by default carriage  return  (CR).   A  custom
               separator may be specified using the <b>-s</b> flag.  The <b>-r</b> flag means to do no replacement (equivalent
               to  a  separator of LF).  If <b>-p</b> is specified, paste bracket control codes are inserted around the
               buffer if the application has requested bracketed paste mode.

       <b>save-buffer</b> [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-b</b> <u>buffer-name</u>] <u>path</u>
                     (alias: <b>saveb</b>)
               Save the contents of the specified paste buffer to <u>path</u>.  The <b>-a</b> option appends  to  rather  than
               overwriting the file.  If <u>path</u> is ‘-’, the contents are read from stdin.

       <b>set-buffer</b> [<b>-aw</b>] [<b>-b</b> <u>buffer-name</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-client</u>] [<b>-n</b> <u>new-buffer-name</u>] <u>data</u>
                     (alias: <b>setb</b>)
               Set the contents of the specified buffer to <u>data</u>.  If <b>-w</b> is given, the buffer is also sent to the
               clipboard  for  <u>target-client</u>  using  the  <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1)  escape sequence, if possible.  The <b>-a</b> option
               appends  to  rather  than  overwriting  the  buffer.   The  <b>-n</b>  option  renames  the  buffer   to
               <u>new-buffer-name</u>.

       <b>show-buffer</b> [<b>-b</b> <u>buffer-name</u>]
                     (alias: <b>showb</b>)
               Display the contents of the specified buffer.

</pre><h4><b>MISCELLANEOUS</b></h4><pre>
       Miscellaneous commands are as follows:

       <b>clock-mode</b> [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>]
               Display a large clock.

       <b>if-shell</b> [<b>-bF</b>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>] <u>shell-command</u> <u>command</u> [<u>command</u>]
                     (alias: <b>if</b>)
               Execute  the  first  <u>command</u>  if  <u>shell-command</u>  (run with <u><a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a></u>) returns success or the second
               <u>command</u> otherwise.  Before being executed, <u>shell-command</u> is expanded using the rules specified in
               the “FORMATS” section, including those relevant to <u>target-pane</u>.  With <b>-b</b>, <u>shell-command</u> is run in
               the background.

               If <b>-F</b> is given, <u>shell-command</u> is not executed but considered success if neither  empty  nor  zero
               (after formats are expanded).

       <b>lock-server</b>
                     (alias: <b>lock</b>)
               Lock each client individually by running the command specified by the <b>lock-command</b> option.

       <b>run-shell</b> [<b>-bC</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>start-directory</u>] [<b>-d</b> <u>delay</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>target-pane</u>] [<u>shell-command</u>]
                     (alias: <b>run</b>)
               Execute  <u>shell-command</u>  using  <u><a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a></u>  or  (with  <b>-C</b>)  a  <b>tmux</b> command in the background without
               creating a window.  Before being executed, <u>shell-command</u> is expanded using the rules specified in
               the “FORMATS” section.  With <b>-b</b>, the command is run  in  the  background.   <b>-d</b>  waits  for  <u>delay</u>
               seconds  before  starting  the  command.  If <b>-c</b> is given, the current working directory is set to
               <u>start-directory</u>.  If <b>-C</b> is not given, any output to stdout is displayed in view mode (in the pane
               specified by <b>-t</b> or the current pane if omitted) after  the  command  finishes.   If  the  command
               fails, the exit status is also displayed.

       <b>wait-for</b> [<b>-L</b> | <b>-S</b> | <b>-U</b>] <u>channel</u>
                     (alias: <b>wait</b>)
               When  used  without  options, prevents the client from exiting until woken using <b>wait-for</b> <b>-S</b> with
               the same channel.  When <b>-L</b> is used, the channel is locked and any clients that try  to  lock  the
               same channel are made to wait until the channel is unlocked with <b>wait-for</b> <b>-U</b>.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       When a <b>tmux</b> client detaches, it prints a message.  This may be one of:

       detached (from session ...)
               The client was detached normally.

       detached and SIGHUP
               The  client  was  detached  and its parent sent the SIGHUP signal (for example with <b>detach-client</b>
               <b>-P</b>).

       lost tty
               The client's <u><a href="../man4/tty.4.html">tty</a></u>(4) or <u><a href="../man4/pty.4.html">pty</a></u>(4) was unexpectedly destroyed.

       terminated
               The client was killed with SIGTERM.

       too far behind
               The client is in control mode and became unable to keep up with the data from <b>tmux</b>.

       exited  The server exited when it had no sessions.

       server exited
               The server exited when it received SIGTERM.

       server exited unexpectedly
               The server crashed or otherwise exited without telling the client the reason.

</pre><h4><b>TERMINFO</b> <b>EXTENSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tmux</b> understands some unofficial extensions to <u><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></u>(5).  It is not normally necessary  to  set  these
       manually, instead the <b>terminal-features</b> option should be used.

       <u>AX</u>      An existing extension that tells <b>tmux</b> the terminal supports default colours.

       <u>Bidi</u>    Tell <b>tmux</b> that the terminal supports the VTE bidirectional text extensions.

       <u>Cs</u>, <u>Cr</u>  Set  the  cursor colour.  The first takes a single string argument and is used to set the colour;
               the second takes no arguments and restores the default cursor colour.  If set, a sequence such as
               this may be used to change the cursor colour from inside <b>tmux</b>:

                     $ printf '\033]12;red\033\\'

               The colour is an <u><a href="../man7/X.7.html">X</a></u>(7) colour, see <u><a href="../man3/XParseColor.3.html">XParseColor</a></u>(3).

       <u>Cmg,</u> <u>Clmg,</u> <u>Dsmg</u>, <u>Enmg</u>
               Set, clear, disable or enable DECSLRM margins.  These  are  set  automatically  if  the  terminal
               reports it is <u>VT420</u> compatible.

       <u>Dsbp</u>, <u>Enbp</u>
               Disable and enable bracketed paste.  These are set automatically if the <u>XT</u> capability is present.

       <u>Dseks</u>, <u>Eneks</u>
               Disable and enable extended keys.

       <u>Dsfcs</u>, <u>Enfcs</u>
               Disable and enable focus reporting.  These are set automatically if the <u>XT</u> capability is present.

       <u>Hls</u>     Set or clear a hyperlink annotation.

       <u>Nobr</u>    Tell <b>tmux</b> that the terminal does not use bright colors for bold display.

       <u>Rect</u>    Tell <b>tmux</b> that the terminal supports rectangle operations.

       <u>Smol</u>    Enable the overline attribute.

       <u>Smulx</u>   Set  a  styled  underscore.   The  single  parameter is one of: 0 for no underscore, 1 for normal
               underscore, 2 for double underscore, 3 for curly underscore, 4 for dotted underscore  and  5  for
               dashed underscore.

       <u>Setulc</u>, <u>Setulc1,</u> <u>ol</u>
               Set  the  underscore  colour  or reset to the default.  <u>Setulc</u> is for RGB colours and <u>Setulc1</u> for
               ANSI or 256 colours.  The <u>Setulc</u> argument is (red * 65536) + (green * 256) + blue where  each  is
               between 0 and 255.

       <u>Ss</u>, <u>Se</u>  Set  or reset the cursor style.  If set, a sequence such as this may be used to change the cursor
               to an underline:

                     $ printf '\033[4 q'

               If <u>Se</u> is not set, Ss with argument 0 will be used to reset the cursor style instead.

       <u>Swd</u>     Set the opening sequence for the working directory  notification.   The  sequence  is  terminated
               using the standard <u>fsl</u> capability.

       <u>Sxl</u>     Indicates that the terminal supports SIXEL.

       <u>Sync</u>    Start (parameter is 1) or end (parameter is 2) a synchronized update.

       <u>Tc</u>      Indicate  that  the  terminal  supports  the  ‘direct  colour’  RGB escape sequence (for example,
               \e[38;2;255;255;255m).

               If supported, this is used for the initialize colour escape sequence (which  may  be  enabled  by
               adding the ‘initc’ and ‘ccc’ capabilities to the <b>tmux</b> <u><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></u>(5) entry).

               This is equivalent to the <u>RGB</u> <u><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></u>(5) capability.

       <u>Ms</u>      Store  the  current  buffer  in the host terminal's selection (clipboard).  See the <u>set-clipboard</u>
               option above and the <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1) man page.

       <u>XT</u>      This is an existing extension capability that tmux uses to mean that the  terminal  supports  the
               <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1) title set sequences and to automatically set some of the capabilities above.

</pre><h4><b>CONTROL</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tmux</b>  offers  a textual interface called <u>control</u> <u>mode</u>.  This allows applications to communicate with <b>tmux</b>
       using a simple text-only protocol.

       In control mode, a client sends <b>tmux</b> commands or command sequences terminated  by  newlines  on  standard
       input.   Each command will produce one block of output on standard output.  An output block consists of a
       <u>%begin</u> line followed by the output (which may be empty).  The output block ends with a  <u>%end</u>  or  <u>%error</u>.
       <u>%begin</u> and matching <u>%end</u> or <u>%error</u> have three arguments: an integer time (as seconds from epoch), command
       number and flags (currently not used).  For example:

             %begin 1363006971 2 1
             0: ksh* (1 panes) [80x24] [layout b25f,80x24,0,0,2] @2 (active)
             %end 1363006971 2 1

       The <b>refresh-client</b> <b>-C</b> command may be used to set the size of a client in control mode.

       In control mode, <b>tmux</b> outputs notifications.  A notification will never occur inside an output block.

       The following notifications are defined:

       <b>%client-detached</b> <u>client</u>
               The client has detached.

       <b>%client-session-changed</b> <u>client</u> <u>session-id</u> <u>name</u>
               The client is now attached to the session with ID <u>session-id</u>, which is named <u>name</u>.

       <b>%config-error</b> <u>error</u>
               An error has happened in a configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       When <b>tmux</b> is started, it inspects the following environment variables:

       EDITOR    If the command specified in this variable contains the string ‘vi’ and VISUAL is unset, use vi-
                 style key bindings.  Overridden by the <b>mode-keys</b> and <b>status-keys</b> options.

       HOME      The user's login directory.  If unset, the <u><a href="../man5/passwd.5.html">passwd</a></u>(5) database is consulted.

       LC_CTYPE  The character encoding <u><a href="../man1/locale.1.html">locale</a></u>(1).  It is used for two separate purposes.   For  output  to  the
                 terminal,  UTF-8  is  used if the <b>-u</b> option is given or if LC_CTYPE contains "UTF-8" or "UTF8".
                 Otherwise, only ASCII characters  are  written  and  non-ASCII  characters  are  replaced  with
                 underscores  (‘_’).   For  input,  <b>tmux</b>  always  runs  with  a UTF-8 locale.  If en_US.UTF-8 is
                 provided by the operating system, it is used and LC_CTYPE is  ignored  for  input.   Otherwise,
                 LC_CTYPE  tells  <b>tmux</b>  what  the  UTF-8  locale is called on the current system.  If the locale
                 specified by LC_CTYPE is not available or is not a UTF-8  locale,  <b>tmux</b>  exits  with  an  error
                 message.

       LC_TIME   The  date  and  time  format  <u><a href="../man1/locale.1.html">locale</a></u>(1).   It  is  used for locale-dependent <u><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a></u>(3) format
                 specifiers.

       PWD       The current working directory to be set in the global environment.  This may be  useful  if  it
                 contains  symbolic  links.   If  the  value  of the variable does not match the current working
                 directory, the variable is ignored and the result of <u><a href="../man3/getcwd.3.html">getcwd</a></u>(3) is used instead.

       SHELL     The absolute path to the default shell for new  windows.   See  the  <b>default-shell</b>  option  for
                 details.

       TMUX_TMPDIR
                 The  parent  directory  of  the directory containing the server sockets.  See the <b>-L</b> option for
                 details.

       VISUAL    If the command specified in this variable contains the string ‘vi’, use vi-style key  bindings.
                 Overridden by the <b>mode-keys</b> and <b>status-keys</b> options.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:~/.tmux.conf">~/.tmux.conf</a></u>
       <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tmux/tmux.conf</u>
       <u><a href="file:~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf">~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf</a></u>
                          Default <b>tmux</b> configuration file.
       <u>/etc/tmux.conf</u>     System-wide configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To create a new <b>tmux</b> session running <u><a href="../man1/vi.1.html">vi</a></u>(1):

             <b>$</b> <b>tmux</b> <b>new-session</b> <b>vi</b>

       Most commands have a shorter form, known as an alias.  For new-session, this is <b>new</b>:

             <b>$</b> <b>tmux</b> <b>new</b> <b>vi</b>

       Alternatively,  the  shortest  unambiguous  form of a command is accepted.  If there are several options,
       they are listed:

             $ tmux n
             ambiguous command: n, could be: new-session, new-window, next-window

       Within an active session, a new window may be created by typing ‘C-b c’ (Ctrl followed  by  the  ‘b’  key
       followed by the ‘c’ key).

       Windows  may  be  navigated  with: ‘C-b 0’ (to select window 0), ‘C-b 1’ (to select window 1), and so on;
       ‘C-b n’ to select the next window; and ‘C-b p’ to select the previous window.

       A session may be detached using ‘C-b d’ (or by an  external  event  such  as  <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1)  disconnection)  and
       reattached with:

             <b>$</b> <b>tmux</b> <b>attach-session</b>

       Typing  ‘C-b ?’ lists the current key bindings in the current window; up and down may be used to navigate
       the list or ‘q’ to exit from it.

       Commands to be run when the <b>tmux</b> server is started may be placed in the <u><a href="file:~/.tmux.conf">~/.tmux.conf</a></u> configuration  file.
       Common examples include:

       Changing the default prefix key:

             set-option -g prefix C-a
             unbind-key C-b
             bind-key C-a send-prefix

       Turning the status line off, or changing its colour:

             set-option -g status off
             set-option -g status-style bg=blue

       Setting other options, such as the default command, or locking after 30 minutes of inactivity:

             set-option -g default-command "exec /bin/ksh"
             set-option -g lock-after-time 1800

       Creating new key bindings:

             bind-key b set-option status
             bind-key / command-prompt "split-window 'exec man %%'"
             bind-key S command-prompt "new-window -n %1 'ssh %1'"
