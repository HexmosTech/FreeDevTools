</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       luit - Locale and ISO 2022 support for Unicode terminals

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>luit</b> [ <u>options</u> ] [ <b>--</b> ] [ <u>program</u> [ <u>args</u> ] ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Luit</b> is a filter that can be run between an arbitrary application and a UTF-8 terminal emulator.  It will
       convert  application  output from the locale's encoding into UTF-8, and convert terminal input from UTF-8
       into the locale's encoding.

       <b>Luit</b> reads its input from the child process, i.e., an application running in the terminal.   <b>Luit</b>  writes
       its output to the terminal.  The two (input and output) can have different encodings.

       An  application  may  also  request  switching to a different output encoding using ISO 2022 and ISO 6429
       escape sequences.  Use of this feature is discouraged: multilingual applications should  be  modified  to
       directly generate UTF-8 instead.

       <b>Luit</b>  is usually invoked transparently by the terminal emulator.  For information about running <b>luit</b> from
       the command line, see EXAMPLES below.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-V</b>     Print <b>luit</b>'s version and quit.

       <b>-alias</b> <u>filename</u>
              the locale alias file
              (default: unknown).

       <b>-argv0</b> <u>name</u>
              Set the child's name (as passed in argv[0]).

       <b>-c</b>     Function as a simple converter from standard input to standard output.

       <b>-encoding</b> <u>encoding</u>
              Set up <b>luit</b> to use <u>encoding</u> rather than the current locale's encoding.

       <b>-g0</b> <u>charset</u>
              Set the output charset initially selected in G0.  The  default  depends  on  the  locale,  but  is
              usually <b>ASCII</b>.

       <b>-g1</b> <u>charset</u>
              Set the output charset initially selected in G1.  The default depends on the locale.

       <b>-g2</b> <u>charset</u>
              Set the output charset initially selected in G2.  The default depends on the locale.

       <b>-g3</b> <u>charset</u>
              Set the output charset initially selected in G3.  The default depends on the locale.

       <b>-gl</b> <u>gn</u> Set  the  initial assignment of GL in the output.  The argument should be one of <b>g0</b>, <b>g1</b>, <b>g2</b> or <b>g3</b>.
              The default depends on the locale, but is usually <b>g0</b>.

       <b>-gr</b> <u>gk</u> Set the initial assignment of GR in the output.  The default depends on the locale, and is usually
              <b>g2</b> except for EUC locales, where it is <b>g1</b>.

       <b>-h</b>     Display a usage and options message on the standard output and quit.

       <b>-ilog</b> <u>filename</u>
              Log into <u>filename</u> all the bytes received from the child.

       <b>-k7</b>    Generate seven-bit characters for keyboard input.

       <b>-kg0</b> <u>charset</u>
              Set the input charset initially selected in G0.  The default depends on the locale, but is usually
              <b>ASCII</b>.

       <b>-kg1</b> <u>charset</u>
              Set the input charset initially selected in G1.  The default depends on the locale.

       <b>-kg2</b> <u>charset</u>
              Set the input charset initially selected in G2.  The default depends on the locale.

       <b>-kg3</b> <u>charset</u>
              Set the input charset initially selected in G3.  The default depends on the locale.

       <b>-kgl</b> <u>gn</u>
              Set the initial assignment of GL in the input.  The argument should be one of <b>g0</b>, <b>g1</b>,  <b>g2</b>  or  <b>g3</b>.
              The default depends on the locale, but is usually <b>g0</b>.

       <b>-kgr</b> <u>gk</u>
              Set  the initial assignment of GR in the input.  The default depends on the locale, and is usually
              <b>g2</b> except for EUC locales, where it is <b>g1</b>.

       <b>-kls</b>   Generate locking shifts (SO/SI) for keyboard input.

       <b>+kss</b>   Disable generation of single-shifts for keyboard input.

       <b>+kssgr</b> Use GL codes after a single shift for keyboard input.  By default, GR codes are generated after  a
              single shift when generating eight-bit keyboard input.

       <b>-list</b>  List  the  supported  charsets  and encodings, then quit.  <b>Luit</b> uses its internal tables for this,
              which are based on the <u>fontenc</u> library.

       <b>-list-builtin</b>
              List the built-in encodings used as a fallback when data from <u>iconv</u> or <u>fontenc</u> is missing.

              This option relies on <b>luit</b> being configured to use <u>iconv</u>,  since  the  <u>fontenc</u>  library  does  not
              supply a list of built-in encodings.

       <b>-list-fontenc</b>
              List the encodings provided by “.enc” files originally distributed with the <u>fontenc</u> library.

       <b>-list-iconv</b>
              List the encodings and locales supported by the <u>iconv</u> library.  <b>Luit</b> adapts its internal tables of
              <u>fontenc</u> names to <u>iconv</u> encodings.

              To  make scripting simpler, <b>luit</b> ignores spaces, underscores and ASCII minus-signs (dash) embedded
              in the names.  <b>Luit</b> also ignores case when matching charset and encoding names.

              This option lists only the encodings which are  associated  with  the  locales  supported  on  the
              current  operating  system.   The  portable  <u>iconv</u>  application  provides  a list of its supported
              encodings with the <b>-l</b> option.  Other implementations may provide similar functionality.  There  is
              no portable library call by which an application can obtain the same information.

       <b>-olog</b> <u>filename</u>
              Log into <u>filename</u> all the bytes sent to the terminal emulator.

       <b>+ols</b>   Disable interpretation of locking shifts in application output.

       <b>+osl</b>   Disable interpretation of character set selection sequences in application output.

       <b>+oss</b>   Disable interpretation of single shifts in application output.

       <b>+ot</b>    Disable  interpretation  of  all  sequences  and  pass  all sequences in application output to the
              terminal unchanged.  This may lead to interesting results.

       <b>-p</b>     In startup, establish a handshake between parent and child processes.  This  is  needed  for  some
              older systems, e.g., to successfully copy the terminal settings to the pseudo-terminal.

       <b>-prefer</b> <u>list</u>
              Set the lookup-order preference for character set information.  The parameter is a comma-separated
              list of keywords.  The default order (listing all keywords) is

                     fontenc,builtin,iconv,posix

              The  default  order  uses  <b>fontenc</b> first because this allows <b>luit</b> to start more rapidly (about 0.1
              seconds) than using <b>iconv</b> for complex encodings such as eucJP.  However, you  may  find  that  the
              iconv  implementation  is  more  accurate  or complete.  In that case, you can use the <b>-show-iconv</b>
              option to obtain a text file which can be used as an encoding with the <b>fontenc</b> configuration.

              This option relies on <b>luit</b> being configured to use <u>iconv</u>,  since  the  <u>fontenc</u>  library  does  not
              provide this choice.

       <b>-show-builtin</b> <u>encoding</u>
              Show a built-in encoding, e.g., from a “.enc” file using the “.enc” format.

              This  option  relies  on  <b>luit</b>  being  configured to use <u>iconv</u>, since the <u>fontenc</u> library does not
              supply a list of built-in encodings.

       <b>-show-fontenc</b> <u>encoding</u>
              Show a given encoding, e.g., from a “.enc” file using the “.enc” format.  If <b>luit</b> is configured to
              use the <u>fontenc</u> library, it obtains the information using that library.  Otherwise <b>luit</b> reads  the
              file directly.

              Some  of  <u>fontenc</u>'s  encodings  are  built  into  the  library.  The <u>fontenc</u> library uses those in
              preference to an external file.  Use the <b>-show-builtin</b> option to provide similar information  when
              <b>luit</b> is configured to use <u>iconv</u>.

       <b>-show-iconv</b> <u>encoding</u>
              Show  a  given  encoding, using the “.enc” format.  If <b>luit</b> is configured to use <u>iconv</u>, it obtains
              the information using that interface.  If <u>iconv</u> cannot supply the  information,  <b>luit</b>  may  use  a
              built-in table.

       <b>-t</b>     Initialize <b>luit</b> using the locale and command-line options, but do not open a pty connection.  This
              option  is  used  for  testing  <b>luit</b>'s configuration.  It will exit with success if no errors were
              detected.  Repeat the <b>-t</b> option to cause warning messages to be treated as errors.

       <b>-v</b>     Be verbose.  Repeating the option, e.g., “<b>-v</b> <b>-v</b>” makes it more verbose.  <b>Luit</b> does not use <u>getopt</u>,
              so “<b>-vv</b>” does not work.

       <b>-x</b>     Exit as soon as the child dies.  This may cause <b>luit</b> to lose  data  at  the  end  of  the  child's
              output.

       <b>--</b>     End of options.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Luit</b> uses these environment variables:

       FONT_ENCODINGS_DIRECTORY
              overrides  the  location  of  the  “encodings.dir”  file, which lists encodings in external “.enc”
              files.

       LC_ALL

       LC_CTYPE

       LANG   During initialization, <b>luit</b> calls <b>setlocale</b> to check if the user's  locale  is  supported  by  the
              operating  system.   If  <b>setlocale</b>  returns  a  failure,  <b>luit</b> looks instead at these variables in
              succession to obtain any clues from the user's environment for locale preference.

       NCURSES_NO_UTF8_ACS
              <b>Luit</b> sets this to tell ncurses to not rely upon VT100 SI/SO controls for line-drawing.

       SHELL  This is normally set by shells other than the Bourne shell, as a convention.  <b>Luit</b> will  use  this
              value (rather than the user's entry in <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>) to decide which shell to execute.  If SHELL is
              not set, <b>luit</b> executes /bin/sh.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>unknown</b>
              The file mapping locales to locale encodings.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Limitations</b>
       None of this complexity should be necessary.  Stateless UTF-8 throughout the system is the way to go.

       Charsets with a non-trivial intermediary byte are not yet supported.

       Selecting alternate sets of control characters is not supported and will never be.

   <b>Security</b>
       On  systems  with  SVR4  (“Unix-98”)  ptys (Linux version 2.2 and later, SVR4), <b>luit</b> should be run as the
       invoking user.

       On systems without SVR4 (“Unix-98”) ptys (notably BSD variants), running <b>luit</b> as an  ordinary  user  will
       leave the tty world-writable; this is a security hole, and <b>luit</b> will generate a warning (but still accept
       to  run).   A possible solution is to make <b>luit</b> suid root; <b>luit</b> should drop privileges sufficiently early
       to make this safe.  However, the startup code has not been exhaustively audited, and the author takes  no
       responsibility for any resulting security issues.

       <b>Luit</b> will refuse to run if it is installed setuid and cannot safely drop privileges.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The most typical use of <b>luit</b> is to adapt an instance of <b>XTerm</b> to the locale's encoding.  Current versions
       of  <b>XTerm</b>  invoke <b>luit</b> automatically when it is needed.  If you are using an older release of <b>XTerm</b>, or a
       different terminal emulator, you may invoke <b>luit</b> manually:

              $ xterm -u8 -e luit

       If you are running in a UTF-8 locale but need to access a remote machine that doesn't support UTF-8, <b>luit</b>
       can adapt the remote output to your terminal:

              $ LC_ALL=fr_FR luit ssh legacy-machine

       <b>Luit</b> is also useful with applications that hard-wire an encoding that is different from the one  normally
       used  on  the  system  or  want  to  use legacy escape sequences for multilingual output.  In particular,
       versions of <b>Emacs</b> that do not speak UTF-8 well can use <b>luit</b> for multilingual output:

              $ luit -encoding 'ISO 8859-1' emacs -nw

       And then, in <b>Emacs</b>,

              M-x set-terminal-coding-system RET iso-2022-8bit-ss2 RET

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       Luit was written by Juliusz Chroboczek &lt;<a href="mailto:jch@pps.jussieu.fr">jch@pps.jussieu.fr</a>&gt; for the XFree86 project.

       Thomas E. Dickey has maintained <b>luit</b> for use by <b>xterm</b> since 2006.
